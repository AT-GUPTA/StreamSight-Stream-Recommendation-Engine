Second issue is the train track selection AI.

Railway Empire 2 doesn't change much from the first, but so far seems to be an overall better game in basically every way. I particularly liked the changes to how Warehouses work, they make a lot more sense now for me (since you don't own the goods there, they are goods that have already been sold and are en route to a specific destination; every good stored in a warehouse now is a good that already has an specific place to go and is just waiting for the transport to arrive - something that the first game fumbled a bit).

The game also no longer penalises you for pausing, a design decision that was weird for many players on the first game. While I have gotten used to playing this without pausing, I absolutely prefer that you can freely pause as should be the case on strategy games.

The graphics are gorgeous and the optimisation is flawless. The music isn't particularly good but it isn't bad either.

What I really like about Railway Empire series, when compared to other tycoons, is how objective-focused the campaign and scenarios can be, with really well made objectives and good time constraints, all the while still being an open strategy game instead of feeling like a puzzle. 

Way too many tycoon games fail for me in being too much ""sandbox"" and not enough ""game"". It's the case of games like Transport Fever or even OpenTTD and RTC. On those games, once you have a stable income, there's generally no real challenge - they are a neat train set for you to play with, more like a toy than a game.

But here on RE there's always something you need to keep doing, and the game keeps constantly testing how efficient you can do it - especially if you're aiming for the high scores and optional goals. I generally prefer this style.",1708563785,1708563785,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The manual signals can be placed anyway you like, but they do not add to a better routing. Trains keep waiting for free track while another train on the same line can use the track even if it should be behind the waiting train. Signals on a straight piece of track don't seem to work.

There is no point in building 4 side by side tracks, 2 for express, 2 for freight, then setting way points and stations, then having freight trains take the express route, backing up the faster moving trains. The stations only allow 2 buildings to be built and since one is almost always maintenance that leaves one slot, BORING! You can only build one business each time the city increases in size and thats only if the computer doesnt beat you to it, again BORING! Warehouses only store six items while the game has many more that cant be stored, once again warehouses are just far to limiting and complicated. Trains sit at stations waiting to load materials but they never get loaded, even though the route looks perfect. There is no notice as to why your train wont load or move, it just sits there even after redoing the route to ensure something wasnt screwed up. setting up rail lines are extremely quirky and frustrating. You can set the first one up perfect and then the second line next to it wont go in, VERY frustrating! I dont believe the game is early access so many of these issues should have been worked out but apparently not. Warehouses seem to be very complicated and surely do not need to be so when it comes to moving freight around.

Some you tubers do their best to explain the many issues, but most are just people playing the game and explaining nothing.

Pro - Nice graphics and rendering of locomotives 

Con - Camera options to view trains are limited and primitive, games could 360 pan decades ago, this can't

Con - Historical Data on trains is fantasy at best, also the train descriptions and their history is generic and lazy 

Con- A lot of famous locomotives are missing, Big Boy, Allegheny, Challenger, Red Devil, Heavy Harry, and etc (I would be fine with DLC to add them, but none if available) Also you can use European Trains in America and vs versa. I don't mind this being a "" Fantasy "" setting you could select, but it by no means should be the default and only choice ( yes I am aware some of the first locomotives crossed the pound to the states)

Pro - Many hours of game play

Con - Campaigns very much keep you on the rails (rim shot) and don't give you much freedom to win multiple ways

Con - Only 5 campaigns, there are dozens that could be added, Russia, China, Australia, Africa, South America ( I do give them props for having a Mexico scenario ). Again this could be DLC I would happily purchase

Con - A lot of hours are do to resets from above and having to completely erase your progress to meet a goal that was was set in a latter era

Gameplay

Pro - Autosave on exit works flawlessly

Pro - Game runs very smoothly 

Con - The mechanics are clunky and counter-intuitive, there should be more control options over your trains when it comes to routing and there simply isn't. Also track routing is cumbersome, and needlessly so. I shouldn't have to lay gridirons individually between every stop and select track direction for each section, I should have an option "" For all of route "" etc. 

Con- If you mislay a track or building and immediately delete it you don't get a full refund and there is no undo button. 

Con-  The UI has some idiosyncrasies that unacceptable for a game in this day and age. For example one little thing, you can use space bar to cycle between pause and play, but you can't hit it again to choose 3x speed, you have to do that manually. Also the fact your max speed option is 3x and not a 10x option too. The gameplay is VERY slow even at 3x speed. This gives ""extended gameplay"" via smoke and mirrors.

I won't belabor the reader with dealing with the idiosyncrasies of new warehouse system (I can live with it), signalling, and limitations on buildings.  Those have already been hashed out in prior reviews or can be seen in the forums.  I will simply focus on these two points:

(1) It is a fun game.  I thoroughly enjoyed playing through all the scenarios and campaigns.   I like the variety of maps, the engineering challenges of laying a good network, and managing the rail lines.  This game will appeal most to gamers who like building and economics-based games.  There is not much in the way of narrative.

(2) It needs a true campaign game.  The ""campaigns"" included are merely long scenarios with layered sets of goals that guide expansion.  RE2 should have a mode like the sandbox -- with no specific goals (or perhaps some popup connection incentives) and a wide open map -- but against AI opponents with a finite amount of starting money and a fixed time limit, say 100 years.  The ultimate goal is to finish the time with the most valuable railroad empire through efficient networking, mergers, etc.

Because it was working on the same save before but now the game is just stuck on some stupid nonsense.
I have 2 cities, A and B connected through a warehouse. Meat is transported from A to B, but COAL IS SUDDENLY NOT TRANSPORTING from B to A (not being picked up, after patch, bug, just one way is not working). If I make new direct line without a stop at the warehouse it works fine both ways.
That is just one example of game being stuck on some stupid bugs.
I am sure it was working. Furthermore after I load the save I can see some COAL in city A (delivered earlier) but NO NEW COAL IS BEING PICKED UP AND DELIVERED TO A after loading save after patch.
All coal is now wasted because the only train that pick it up suddenly doesn't want to pick it up and deliver it to a warehouse, but meat is taken from the warehouse and delivered back without a problem - suddenly after update.

Pros.
-Map size is big, lots of room to expand how you see fit
-Lots of new product and goods to transport and produce
-Multiplayer                        ( haven't tried it yet, but the possibility to experience tycoon with friends is cool )

Cons.
-research to slow             ( allow to skip the time barriers between decades or bring back the university perk)
-time is too slow on default, Please lead people to the game-play settings so they know the speed can be adjusted
-allow and option to disable the speed of the game slowing down when you zoom in and out 


Summery you need to tell people about the upgrade all locomotives screen, and the speed change settings before I found this it took me 8 hours from 1830 to 1834

However, the game lacks a lot of quality of life options that I came to expect from other city builder games. Here are the ones I thing are absolutely necessary for the game:

1. When opening some menus (like the quarterly earnings) the game does not pause. The game should auto-pause in these situations.
2. !MOST IMPORTANT! No way to control which tracks can be used by freight and express trains. To keep the two types of trains separate you need to manually add waypoints for each track section which becomes very tedious in the late-game when you get to have 100 routes.
[strike]3. There is no cargo prioritisation. If a train can fully load at a station, it will always do so. This makes multi-stop routes kindof inefficient. It would be nice if you could specify the maximum load for a train at a given station, to leave room for upcoming stations.[/strike]
4. Number of carts on train is always 8. On some routes, I would love to have more then 8 carts, on some 4 is enough. Why is this not configurable?

If you've played the original, you'll be right at home in this one, but beware some of the improvements have significantly changed the game-play.

The economics have been tuned to be much tighter. You need to give much more attention to your operating costs and it's not as easy to generate income. You will want to keep a sharp eye on supply and demand as warehousing changes mean you can't stockpile bulk amounts of goods. 

The growth rate for cities seems slower which feels more realistic, with consumption of demanded goods lower as part of the slower growth. You can keep you cities at higher rates of fulfilment but it doesn't seem to impact growth to the same level as the first game. 

The previously tedious staff system of the first game is dead and buried. You still have staff, but it's global now instead of per train. Signals, track placement and intersecting train lines are also far easier to manage, allowing you to focus on the tighter economics. 

If you enjoyed the first game, you'll get at least an equal amount of value out of this one. Some of the changes aren't to my personal liking, but they're not enough to cause dislike of the whole thing.

- The lots of options of how you build and connect your various rail lines to the cities.  
- The increasing complexity to the products and what is required to produce the products.
- The ride along view.  Fun to do while waiting for time to go by.  Such as money to accrue to buy a building.

DISLIKE:
- The huge jumps in the cost of rural businesses; grain, wool, milk, etc.  One second the businesses are in the 200,000-500,000 range then they are 2.5-12 million range.
- The limitations on how many specialties a station can have.  I think two is a little low because almost always one of the spots is going to be taken up by a Maintenance Depot.  It would have been better to be able to place a Maintenance area that the train could go to after X number of trips.  That way a train would not be taking up space on a track while (especially at extremely busy stations) being maintained.
- TRACK BUILDING / LAYING:
= The silliness of the way the track will not allow you to build / lay track, but if you come from the opposite direction it lays just fine.
= That a track is ""too close to an existing"" track even though you are following the curve of an already existing track.  To get around this you destroy the original track.  Use the saved plan for track #2 and lay it.  Then go back and relay track #1 / original.  Just annoying and adds time.
= That the track does not always snap to the existing track.  You have to add multiple points along the way so the system knows what to do.
= You can't choose an option to lay two (2) tracks at once.  This would be very useful in the later part of games when you have plenty of money to do this.
= WHEN A TRACK IS REMOVED BUT THE GAME THINKS IT IS STILL THERE.  You cannot see it.  You cannot re-destroy it.  You cannot build on top of it.  Your only option is to go back to a save that does not have this issue.

From what I have played, this is fun, its not overwhelming like a LOT of the other games of this kind but It keeps you on your toes and focused. I enjoy this game a lot tbh, and if you like recorce management and logistic games, this is what your looking for.

But the game boils down to city growth which for me was not an exciting part of the game.  You can not  really control your train load outs and design train types.  

Again, Its more of a city growth game vs an actual railroad game.   Resources are too few and some don't make sense per the period and map locations.   The game basically wants you to build warehouses and short line trains vs running long run multi stop train load outs. Played a couple of the Scenario and it again was basically connect the 4 resources you have add the 3/4 cities you have to unlock the next map area. Oh, and do it faster than the BOT.   The Campaign is even better when you have to deliver SUGAR from outside Boston (yes SUGAR farm outside of BOSTON!) but hey its next to the Rhode Island PEACH farm!

That's not a rail empire game its really lame.  Also, I want coal, steel and iron ore in the great lakes not grain, peaches  and other non real resources to move.   This is what totally makes this game unplayable in my book.   The same resources for every city that don't match geography.  I want to run a Shay out of WV with coal to the mills in the Pittsburgh and Cleveland and so on.  Not milk, meat and other random resources.,

It says I have about half of what I actually have time wise but that's because I play in offline mode.

This game is probably my favorite of all time. You can get addicted to the strategy or just enjoy a ride along in first person on incredibly detailed locomotives and toot the horn. There are a lot of complaints about the strategy side of things but in the roughly 15 hours I've played so far it's been nothing but addicting, though I'm not the brightest when it comes to RTS games.

You can do campaign, custom, or freeplay. Campaign is slightly more linear with dialogue and tasks and you get rewarded skins for certain locos by completing various campaign missions. Big thing for me was realizing the locos are rotated as time goes on, even in the free mode where you can do whatever. Locos run for 30 years I believe, and you get a new batch to research every 10. Generally if you're at 1860 or later you'll always have 15 locos to choose from as there will be 5 in each 10 year period. So if you have a specific loco you're after, make sure to choose a mission or set the year so that that locomotive is available for the longest possible time. After 30 years the loco will be put out of service. Time doesn't fly by in the game as it's not meant to be a rush through the entire tech tree, it is paced for a much more in-depth slow crawl of changes through decades not centuries. 

Locomotives are customizable in the engine shed, all of them allow custom paint colors (always only 3 tone capable but better than nothing). There are skins but most are very bland or hilariously over the top so if you like realism then you're stuck with custom paint or the original scheme.  You can ride along which attaches your camera to the locomotive and you can toot the horn and fly into the cab at the controls which makes for very scenic and fun journeys if you want to admire your railroad from the tracks, all cars are highly detailed and just lovely to look at.

Its fun, its pretty, and it brings the child in me joy to see such a large number of incredible locomotives brought to light in a fun game like this. 10/10 from me. (PS devs I would love a 20th-21st century version of this too)",1692468756,1693697639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The competition takes very strange actions and usually just stops developing at some point. They seem to have unlimited funding, but the intelligence they put into them is very poor. With today's optimizations and AI you would expect to be blown away at the highest levels. 

The game also lacks a view good overviews to really manage things when you run a lot of trains and businesses. It is very difficult to see what is doing well and what not. But fortunately that doesn't matter, the computer does worse. When you buy one of the competitors companies and you take everything over you wonder how they were making money in the first place. Usually they are still using the very first locomotives.

There are some small snags here and there with laying tracks, but overall it works pretty smooth. And the terrain view helps a lot. Too bad you can only build 2 buildings at a station, you typically want many more.

Still I recommend the game because it is highly entertaining, making for an interesting abstraction of the world of railroads and its history.

This game is undoubtedly a B+, and the items below are QOL improvements that could take it to an A+.  If you're a fan of logistics games or railway games, it's one of the best, if not currently the best, out there.

I'm a Giga Chad and decided to read:  There are essentially 10 issues that prevent this game from being an A+.  I'll try to denote the issue, an example, and then a recommended fix.  I've beaten the first 4 scenarios at max rating, and the last one at the second to last rating, and I've got 171 hours in the game.  So I think i'm at a point where I hope my observations aren't seen as flippant.

1) Warehouses restricted to 6 goods: I expect this is done because the total goods on a train, if more than 6 choices, start to overload the GUI.  However, you have nearly 20+ goods in the game.  Even assuming that warehouses in a single city don't need to list such goods on the warehouse for storage, this makes it impossible for the 3 train station caps, each with their own warehouses, to handle all goods in the game, thereby knocking out one of the most important parts: i.e. ensuring you can have a good logistics network set up.

2) Stating that a train should not depart unless it is full: This seems like a simple no brainer and is so when you only have one train.  The issue is when you have multiple trains.  I.E. if I have 1 train, it'll wait at the station until it's full, then depart.  Easy, and it greatly cuts down on traffic and costs per trip, especially when you're daisy chaining warehouses.  The real issue is when you have more than one train.  At certain times, you may have say up to 4 trains sitting at the same station, and rather than the game only filling one train at a time, it'll split the goods amongst all waiting trains.  Thus, if you say ""Hey, train with a caboose and refrigerator, only depart if you have 6 cars, so you're at 8 total cars.""  You could have 4 trains, each slowly filling up, when in reality you should have only one being filled up, and the others waiting.  This further compounds inefficiency in that those trains are taking up tracks, and could be preventing other trains from up or down the daisy chain from dropping off their goods.  FIX: Make it where if you have multiple trains going on the same line (with the minimum cars requirement), the train will only fill up one train at a time.

3) Cities won't accept certain goods until a population threshhold is met.  I find it really hard to believe that small town won't want fresh fruits, vegetables, or milk until there's enough people.  This becomes even more apparent with refined goods like cheese.  All goods should be in demand, and the demand should scale with the population.  Thus a small town needs fruit, veggies, milk, and cement, but not as much as a metropolis.  Again, I think this was done by the developers to cut down on the number of choices a person has to make when shuttling goods, but come on, let us figure it out and reward us for good logistics.

4) Supply Towers: Supply towers across long distances make sense, but when I have two cities very close to each other....they should fill up on Oil, Water, and Sand while they're offloading.  And this honestly shouldn't take more than a day.  This would also clear up the unnecessary tech tree additions speeding this process up.  Per the note below on buildings caps, if the developers really want to make it cost something, then just make it a new building; but I can't imagine a town that has a station not being able to handle what is simple maintenance.  It's akin to a gas station not having gas...

5) Supply Towers cause a slowdown even when not used: self explanatory.  When you have as short distance between cities, with the supply tower in the middle, this sometimes prevents express routes.  My key example is map 5, the two cities in the top left (can't remember) can't be express lines with a sand tower due to this requirement.  FIX: When a train departs, it should be able to calculate if it needs a tower, and if so, slow down, if not, then don't slow down.

6) Warehouse ""shunting"" needs an overhaul.  So warehouse shunting is the only way to play the game and ensure every city in your domain gets to 120K.  I.E. you set up your warehouses to keep pushing goods down the line.  While it's obviously doable now, it makes it where when you add a single good to your network, you have to pause the game, and then go from the good all the way from city to city and say ""Ok, pick up new good here, but NOT at the new city"", then go to the new city and repeat.  FIX: this one's a bit harder, in that I think it would require it's own new GUI, akin to the Flow of Goods GUI.  Whereby you would have to click a good, then drag it from point to point in one direction (with forks) to prevent you from having to go station by station.

7) City demand needs to be tapered down: When i hit metropolises, sometimes i need dedicated lines to ensure 2 goods are maxed out, and they're running at maximum efficiency.  This seems a bit much.  This also essentially neuters daisy chaining warehouses, because even with 4 full lanes constantly carrying cargo, I can't meet demand.  FIX: demand just needs an overhaul.

8) Trains being maintained should be taken off the tracks.  By end game, metropolises with even up to 8 lines are often bogged down due to waiting on maintained trains.  Any train station is going to have a roundabout to take the train off the tracks.  Could you imagine going to station and seeing a train with no cars, and engineers out there?  When you ask ""Heya....I'm running late for my literal express ticket"" you get a ""yeah, we figured out how to cross the entirety of europe, but a separate roundabout and maintenance shed?  Haven't figured that out chief.  C'est la vie!""  FIX: Remove the warehouse cap on buildings (in the point below), and add a new building that allows trains under maintenance to be removed from the track, then when there's a free spot, they're put back on.  This mechanic already exists with new trains being added to lines, so I think the bones are there.

9) Stations should not be capped on buildings: I think this is a bid to make it where folks ""diversify"" their stations...but it's not working.  If I can build something like grand central station, let me put as many buildings there as I want.  People often have their first station have the first 2 lines being express, then lines 2-6 being freight.  If you daisy chain warehouses, you've lost one slot already, and the other is likely going to be maintenance.  ""But what about putting a station between them that is only used for maintenance, in order to free up the end lines?"" Yeah, you could, but you're adding a building a stop just to handle what could easily be handled at the end line.  This is an unnecessary addition to logistics.  FIX; Just uncap building slots.

10) Lines should presume you want the train restricted all the way down the line.  I.E. if you have City A -> Warehouse - City B, and you say ""hey express line, only use lines 1 and 2"", then once the train goes from City A to the Warehouse, it will thereafter just arbitrarily choose whatever line it wants.  This doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you have dedicated lines for express and freight, you don't want to have your express line stuck behind a slow freight train.  The fix for this is creating waypoints, but they're just a hassle: I.E. City A to Waypoint 1 to Warehouse to Waypoint 2 to City B to Waypoint 3 to Warehouse to Waypoint 4 to City.  FIX: Make it where a dedicated line runs through everything.

Turns out cities can be just as troublesome as survivors.

As your cities grow, they need more and different products/resources to keep growing.  If fulfillment falls below 40 percent, the cities begin to lose population.  If one of your objectives is to send newspapers to Paris – but Paris will only want newspapers after hitting 115k population – woe be you if you don’t ensure that Paris gets all the products it needs before it will grow to 115k.

That can entail blasting furniture, ceramics, chemicals and a host of other goods from far-flung locations to Paris, each pretty much requiring a separate freight train dedicated to supplying that particular good.  Which leads to congestion, delays and breakdowns around Paris.  Which can require building separate terminals in Paris and elsewhere for freight and passengers and interweaving new freight lines among your existing passenger lines.  Some people even create separate lines for mail.

Holy guacamole.  Instead of building an elegant and efficient rail network, I feel as if I am babysitting crying toddlers who want ever more toys.  Sorry, Paris, but not seeing newspapers in your future.  (Newspapers were actually an optional objective if you wanted the highest score.)  

I mistakenly thought that marketing the goods each city produces was the goal.  And it is, but only indirectly, because it all comes down not to producing more, but to consuming more.  Silly me.

Can you sense a touch of frustration with the endgame? Which is doubly frustrating, because everything before that can be so compelling and engrossing.  It’s the kind of game I want, where you look up and are surprised that it is 1 or 2 in the morning.

It takes a particular kind of person to play a simulation game, but it takes a particular kind of that person to do the ultra-micromanaging to achieve all the population objectives in some of the scenarios, and I’m the former kind of person.  I’ve never enjoyed a game and at the same time felt so frustrated by it.

If you are like me and can greatly enjoy connecting cities by rail, getting them the basic resources they need for their native industries, and shipping your beer, meat or cloth to neighboring cities, the game is well worth buying.  But not everybody will think growing Paris or Austin or Denver to a prescribed population is worth the effort – and it’s not always an optional objective if you want to complete the scenario.

One last thought: I read a post a while back that criticized the “snowballing” effect, where the more money you have, the more money you make (express trains with dining cars, mail cars and cabooses are the ticket), until it comes in faster than you can spend it.  It does happen.  I ended some games with more than $100 million.
											
But I rather like it.  It gives me a glimpse into what it must have felt like to be a Vanderbilt, Stanford or other railroad magnate.  But if I want to tear up my whole network to make room for more terminals and freight lines, complexity, not cost, is the only consideration.  The game would be less fun if I had to scrimp in the endgame as I did in the early game.  Now if only those dollars were real ....

P.P.S.  After reading a number of reviews citing rampant ""glitchiness,"" crashing and such, I thought I would indicate that there are those of us who have not experienced such things.  In more than 300 hours of gameplay, my game hung once, and it did seem to slow down a bit when I had more than 100 trains running.  As a veteran of Bethesda games, that kind of performance qualifies as spectacular.  I believe the folks who have had problems, but I don't think it is the general experience and it is always possible that there are problems not having anything to do with the software in those instances.  

As for glitchiness and bugs, it's a bit hard to analyze, given that that is often the extent of the criticism.  I'm wondering how often those folks did not take into account, e.g., the ""twice as far rule"" (if your train line travels twice as far as the crow would fly to a destination, then passengers will I guess walk instead).  I cursed at the game more than once, before I realized the problem was with me, not the game.   Or if the tracks are said to be ""too close together,"" that can generally be solved by moving the endpoint a little farther this way or that, or starting building with the other track first.  

Gridirons have to be placed a crazy distance from the station the more tracks you have, and that can cause problems if you have other stations close by, but that's not a glitch or a bug.  Stations can actually be built at the extreme fringe of a resource circle without connecting to the resource -- it pays to pay attention to the tooltip in the lower left.  Statistics for passengers and freight are for a given period, and, yes, they can read zero percent, even if you have a train line dedicated to delivering those passengers or goods if the train has not completed its route during that given time period.

Pull down your entire railway list now and then and scan for triangles indicating a problem with a particular line.  Often it is a missing gridiron or portion of a track without direction -- and switches can leave small portions of track without direction, if you don't check carefully all the affected tracks.  Again, though, not a bug.  

So often something that I initially thought was a bug could be solved with a bit of persistence or a better understanding of the nature of the problem.",1691333221,1692900049,True,8,0,0.59696197509765625,1,True,False,False

I definitely like the station buildings better. Some of the weird stuff is gone, like having to build the station near the center of the city. That was pointless and annoying in the first game. The line management system is improved for quality of life as well; it's easier and less messy to manage lines in late game when you've got 80+ railway lines.

I think I liked the employee system from the first game better. It was just more fun to mix and match employees to trains. It's a simpler system now, which can be nice late game, but it's less fun. I also think there should be stop points for single tracks like there were in the first game. In this game, the points are added automatically when you create a directional track, which is fine, but now you can't add points to single tracks. Often with rural stations, I'll only need one train back and forth on the line so I won't bother building two parallel tracks. Early game track cost matters. But sometimes at busier stations that single line track can cause slow downs simply because I can't put stop points on it like I could in the last game.

The ""Flow of Goods"" overlay seems really handy, except it doesn't really seem to work the way that I would want it to. For the flow of goods that are produced in a given city, it's not bad.  I guess if I have a gripe about it, it's that I'd like to be able to get more specific data from it. It could be very useful for passengers and mail, but it's just not specific enough as far as telling you what percentage of the passengers from a given station that would like to go to another given station are getting there by train. Sometimes I'm not sure how it's intended to be used. I'll filter by passengers and pick a station, and all the surrounding stations will just say 0%. I know more than 0% of passengers are getting from that station to the other stations, because I've got Express trains running and passengers loaded, so it doesn't make sense to me. Let's take Shreveport in Chapter 4, for example. In the Flow of Goods > Passengers overlay, it says there are 602 passengers per week with 0% train usage. I know this is incorrect, I have express trains going to and from Shreveport to every other connected city. Then, if I hover over Shreveport, it shows me how many passengers want to go to the connected stations, but again shows 0% getting there. Incorrect, and not helpful lol.

However, it's still a great game, and I would argue that it's improved over the first game, which was a great game also. For a railway sim, 10/10.",1692836004,1692837268,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

On it's own it's quite a nice Railway Tycoon game with some nice details and probably one of the best track-laying tools around. Sadly even after three months its still riddled with many bugs and tends to crash rather frequently.

The big problems show when you compare it to the first one. After all, where are the differences between this and Railway Empire 1? The graphics are updated - but are they better? That depends... The game has lost it's cartoony appearance of the first game and opts more for a photorealistic look. Does it work? Eh, not sure. I personally find it rather convoluted and things are hard to make out at times. Granted the details, especially on the locomotives are far better and look rather nice.

The maps are far bigger. Again though, is that better? It's just more of the same really.

Some of the gameplay aspects have been updated. The rail laying has been simplified, some micro management aspects have been dropped but other than that it's still the same as the first one. 

Now for the scummy aspects: the Soundtrack is exactly the same as the first game, with just a hand full of tracks being new.

Even worse; the entire collection of rolling stock is copied directly from the first game. Yes, the amount of locomotives is quite nice and they all look and sound amazing - but there isn't a single new locomotive that wasn't in the first game.

Oh and the ""guidebooks"" which for the most part are just a few sentences written for every locomotive is a ""DLC"". There was a time where such things were part of the user manual... (On top of that it's riddle with typos and bad or flat-out wrong pictures)


So in the end, it depends on you. Do you already have the first game? Then I don't really see a reason to get Railway Empire 2. You haven't played the first game and are looking for a new Railway Tycoon clone? I'd suggest you take a look at the artstyle of this and the first game and decide then.

I do like the game but my recommendation gets a barely passing grade due to the high price and the lack of gameplay improvements and innovations over the first game.

INTRO AND BASICS
Exactly as per the first game, the game is a business railway tycoon game based in the 1800s and early 1900s. Namely, steam trains galore. Objective is to grow your company by building infrastructure and trains, and connecting cities and industries with each other. No modern trains - a missed opportunity for growth in my opinion - so if you prefer to play with contemporary infrastructure then this game is not for you.

GAMEPLAY
Many relatively minor changes to the game. No need to micromanage workers is the biggest difference, and a good one - now staffing decisions are based off on global HR decisions like salaries and benefits, which make much more sense than the nonsensical micromanagement from the first game. 

Other changes include automatic signals and easier track direction assignments, and train lines as opposed to single train management. While city growth still strictly depends on cargo supply, it is easier to make them grow in this game. Overall, less emphasis in micromanaging and more emphasis on global operations, and a step in the right direction. 

However, there are features that were altogether removed, like track mode control - strict signaling vs. no collision mode, no manual signaling, and some annoying issues and restrictions, such as Warehouses not sharing goods in the cities they are in, and settlements unable to grow into cities.

BUILDING
Largely the same as the first game. Player is limited to building railway infrastructure, plus a handful of industries and urban buildings per city.

Game remains 2D in the sense that the player has no direct control over elevation building. Tracks are simple to build, though complex or specific layouts can be frustrating to build due to the lack of direct control over track height. Track crossovers - called ""gridirons"" in this game - greatly simplify building track station approahces.

Lots of restrictions remain for the sake of gameplay, like industry levels fixed with ""city levels"" - whatever that means - problems building bypasses through towns, must build contiguous networks, and number of buildings you can build per city is limited. Even more nonsensical are train station extensions, limited to 2 per station, while major stations of the era certainly would have all of them at once.

GRAPHICS AND ARTWORK
Decent enough graphics, a tad better than it was in the first game. Artwork and design is very similar to the first game. NPC artwork is improved over the first game. CGI and background story is a nice addition. That being said, if you played the first game, you are not buying this one just solely due to this reason.

MAPS, MODS and CUSTOMIZATION
No mods, no map editor, no random map generator, no ability to modify maps ingame, even custom sandbox is fairly limited on what you can alter. A huge wasted opportunity in my opinion, in comparison with the competition. 

Maps are larger, in particular, you can play the entire North America or European continents, with the option to play smaller maps if one desires for personal or hardware reasons.

But if you played the first game, it feels like deja vu, as the available maps - no matter if you are playing campaign, scenario, or sandbox - are based on either continent only, for now, and chances are one already played on these locations in the first game...

MUSIC
Decent and fits well with the era. That being said, most of it is recycled or heavily inspired from the first game, and thus offers nothing new to the series.

MULTIPLAYER and AI
As in the first game, the game allows you to compete head to head against other railway companies. However, competition is only against AI, and multiplayer, a new addition to the series, is limited to only co-op. Better than having none at all though, so a step on the right direction. AI avatars are better drawn, but remain annoying to listen, and worst of all, they cannot even be turned off ingame... The AI itself remains ""dumb"" and fairly easy to beat.

SUMMARY:
Is RE2 a good game? On its own is a ok transportation game, though by all means not great given its high price and the availability of competitors who offer similar but much more flexible and customizable gameplay.

For those that played RE1, however, the game feels more like a reskin of the first game - at 6x times the current price - with some gameplay rule changes rather than new game features and improvements.

Indeed, without Workshop and a map editor, which are present in the RE1, one can say this game has regressed as opposed to improving over the first game. 

I still recommend the game, but only for people new to the series - and honestly they will not miss much if they decide to play RE1 instead - or if one wants to try out the bigger maps or updated game rules. 6/10",1687826539,1691189997,True,24,0,0.731087267398834229,2,True,False,False

*The loading of specific raw materials doesn't always pick up the maximum number you set. If you just set from 0 minimum to 8 maximum car load for raw materials, it'll pick up the entire train load first time or two and them its smaller to the point where the train is not loading any raw materials at all. Even though the raw materials have filled back up. To add, if you set a minimum of 2 and what ever maximum you want, it'll choose the minimum. 

*Loading raw materials take a long time even though there's plenty of it in storage as it shows. It should be immediately loading the train whilst producing at the rate its being shown.

*The speed of time going by is very slow even at 2x the speed. There should be at least 3X speed (or more) to be able to get through days and months as much one can do.

These are some the issues I've been dealing with so far, and will try to find more to write in this review. Just wanted to point out the instant issues I feel are hurting this game.

Railway Empire 2 - Update 1.0.3: Trains that are loading raw materials and delivering them to the main city stations after a while load with zero cars. Even though there are plenty of supply in each raw materials left, the train acts like there's nothing left and moves on.

Update on Hotfix 1.0.3: Now, when I put the station gridirons, specifically when I build 4 tracks to encompass. When setting up a rail line only TWO rail lines are shown instead of all four, even though I put different directions for each of them.

As a mild player of RE 1 and a heavy player of RRT2 for many years, RE 2 is a good investment if you're in to this type of genre. RE 1 was fun to experience a modern approach to rail building, train management, and the economy, but it never really pulled me in as much as RRT2 had. It feld quirky, like hiring a person for a single train for example. Too much of a light-hearted take to a game of rail building and business management I was used to.

I've been playing RE 2 for a bit now, and I'm getting more into it than RE 1. After learning the new mechanics, I like the changes they made. The biggest change I've seen so far is the warehousing system. You can no longer haul products to a specific warehouse of your choice, stockpiling there. The train will only haul goods if those goods have already been purchased somewhere down the line. This is way more realistic, because after all, you're just the transporter, you don't own the goods and thus, you'd never haul them in the first place without the buyer and seller dealing.

Also, staffing is way more realistic and now it's more of a macromanagement thing than a per-train thing. I enjoy the system of being able to pay more to them to get more out of them. It's quite simple, but in my opinion this is a good place to keep it simple in the game.

Rail building is enjoyable, and it's actually not a major headache to upgrade stations as you increase traffic. I don't mind coming in and interrupting a very busy line to temp delete lines in order to upgrade any more. You can actually double the size of a busy station in a city within 10 minutes, generally speaking.

Managing ""lines"" rather than ""trains"" (from the ol' RRT2 days) is real nice, and the interface is not only easy to get used to, but it also contains information you actually and only need. A quick synopsis of utilization and usage, profitability, things like that, just enough to take a quick look, and move on. 

Edit: [b]I would like to see an easier way to upgrade trains in the future. Currently you have to go to each line and change the train type manually.[/b] Well I just found out there is a way in the game to do this via the Engine Shed, so never mind!

New to the Railway Empire series (I didn't play Railway Empire 1) I have become totally addicted - just like I was with Railroad Tycoon 1, 2 & 3 many years ago!

Track laying is easy to use and intuitive, it is also easy to remove track (and get credit for the original laying costs).  I love that there isn't too much micro management and there is no need to set your own signals (signal lovers will be able to set their own as an option in an upcoming patch).  The use of waypoints to force trains to use certain tracks is very useful when creating express routes that bypass stations for example. 

The supply/demand system works great and the ""flow of goods"" button allows for easy planning for getting types of freight (of which there are many) from the source to the final consuming city.

I had thought that being able to ride in your own trains as they cross the countryside would be a gimmick however I find myself doing this often and enjoy the thrill of seeing the scenery and the other trains on my network as they pass by.

The five chapters of the campaign increase in complexity with each one, providing a good challenge as new trains and types of freight are introduced along with targets such as buyouts of your competitors.

Positives: 
With multiple trains on the same route being grouped, it's actually feasible to manage a large network.
I'm not a big fan of being limited to two station extensions, but it does work better than the standalone warehouses did.
Setting direction is greatly improved.
Being able to run more parallel tracks is a plus.
Better UI and all than Railroad Corporation.
Somewhat a higher level business simulator rather than a super detailed train sim such as Derail Valley.

Negatives:
The AI are still a complete pushover.  It's not remotely challenging to beat them.  And I am playing on the hardest settings.
Only three AI players in a game.  Which wouldn't be too bad if the AI was actually challenging.
Multiplayer consists of co-op on THE SAME COMPANY.
No competitive multiplayer.  If there were more AI, the AIs were actually challenging, and you could play with another person who had their own company, this could be forgiven.
I wish resources were more grounded in reality.  I.E. there is probably not a lot of cotton grown in Canada.
I don't understand why there aren't more resources, either.  Like some maps have fish, but continental America doesn't have fish.  Even though there are coastal cities.  Why?

I wish the devs would try out the old game ""Rails Across America"".  The graphics were primitive, but gameplay was 1000% times more entertaining.  The reason I don't play it anymore is because I have to use an old computer, I was proficient at it enough that it wasn't a challenge anymore, and I couldn't get a game going over the internet.  If the traits of that game could be merged with the better graphics etc of Railway Empire 2, it would be a good game.

Railway Empire 2 is a game that hides almost everything about how it works and leaves it up to you to figure it out.... in a cool railroad skin.  it took sufficient liberties with its abstraction to be close to the truth and still fun.

This one, however, may very well be the worst sim game I have played.  There is potential for this game to be great but would take a lot of work to make fun.  In its current state it is just a grind that feels like a job.

Game breaking mechanics:
-Sometimes warehouses within a city do not share goods to the city, so the city will be starve for resources and shrink in population (even though the goods are at the train station IN THE CITY)
-Cities will stop requesting goods even when the supply is at 0 and no other train line can provide the resource.  Even when a direct line between the supply and the city exists, and a full inventory of goods available, the train will only bring 0 or 1 load of the demanded resource.
-Trains do not automatically find a new route through grid irons if the original (or shortest) path becomes blocked.  If you want to maintain control of train pathing DO NOT USE GRID IRONS
-Camera controls are extremely limited and make it impossible to predict where the terrain increases/decreases height.  Preplanning rail lines is impossible without adding better camera controls or providing a topographical map overlay. 

Balancing Issues:
-The game speed is atrocious.  There are only 2 speeds (becomes slightly faster if you zoom out far enough..) and progressing through a couple decades would take weeks of playing.  Once you have spent all your money you may as well just leave the game running and do something else for an hour.  No clue why they didn't add a 4x speed or faster
-Mountain ranges lack realistic valleys to build train lines.  Sure, building a tunnel is a streamlined method of connecting A and B through mountains, but having $2million to build that infrastucture is unrealistic early game.  A tunnel through a mountain should be a late game improvement to speed up connections, not mandatory.

This is another cash-grab sequel from Kalypso and has barely changed the game from the original version.  The small features that have been added make the game tedious and slow.  Spend your money elsewhere!",1690132129,1690132129,False,65,0,0.800456881523132324,4,True,False,False

The tutorial is worth the time, but doesn't cover things you should probably jump on Reddit to see people do.  I've learned if things aren't flowing, to check the direction of all the tracks I've laid for instance (which requires a different view of the track), not too hard to debug.  I like how you can modify rail lines, that is trains grouped together with the same route, with a convenient interface.  The automation is decent in that regard.  I got to about 300M value in the first map, my first play through, and I'm still learning tip and tricks.

It has the basic economy features would want/expect from a railroad tycoon type simulation.  You can buy/auction rural business (like farms, ranches, timberyards) etc and they have the ability to grow and ramp up over time with investment.  As cities grow, you can buy new manufacturing faculties and upgrade existing ones you've purchased.

I'm early in, just the first campaign completed, but I've played and stopped playing enough railrood tycoon types games to give this one a positive.  I bought the first one, but the tutorial/first map I never made it past.

The ride-along feature is a way to kick back and enjoy your work.  My biggest complaint, is that if I train is set to pick something up and but pick up anything, it doesn't tell you why.

The real problem is that I feel like I'm doing everything right: I've connected everything properly, built multiple tracks, hell I've even split passenger and freight trains onto separate tracks. I've gone in and manually controlled paths and platforms. I've set up warehouses. I've poured money into personnel to make my trains just that tiny bit more efficient. I've set up and expanded factories... and it just doesn't work.

I have a source of wood connected to a city right next to it, and yet the city is sitting on 0% wood. And even when the train goes, it only loads 4 cars... WHY?! Maybe there's an explanation for this, maybe the city is waiting to get wood from somewhere else, maybe it's sitting in a warehouse somewhere waiting for transport... Maybe!

There has been a bad rap from players who played the first game and some of it was justified.
My biggest problem from the first game to the second game is the lack of detail in the maps. They changed the scale of the maps to work as a single map for all of the US or all of Europe and the regional maps are just cut out of those larger maps. So Ultimately all the landmarks that were present in the map from the first game are gone making the maps very boring and feeling more artificial. But the graphical detail in the tress and other small things is much higher. I hope they come out with more maps that feel more tied to the places they are meant to represent.
The positives are the streamlined track building mechanics. In railway 1 I mostly played on easy mode where trains could pass through each other because I didn't like messing with the signals and directions. But that is all much easier to deal with in this game and I haven't had many problems with it. The only thing is the automatically placed lights sometimes do not place correctly in short distance tracks which can be frustrating.
I really enjoyed the new campaign. It is not a rehash of the old campaign missions, but entirely new. The scenarios are also really engaging. The difficulty on the campaign missions is quite easy if you are a seasoned player from the first game. I wish there was a difficulty setting.

It looks and feels better than RE1 that's for sure. And most people complain about it being a reskin of the RE1, well... we can't suddenly invent trains that never existed or rewrite history. It's a train sim game, It tells the story of how trains came to be, and in a fun way. RE2 executes this properly. They could make over 9000 train management games and they would still all be reskins, simply because there is only 1 story to tell.

So yeah, it looks a lot better, it's more managable, It feels all in all more realistic and more fun to me. 

But as much as they improved, there are still old aches they couldn't polish away. 

""Can't build a junction on a bridge"". There is no bridge near where i want to build. i literally can't connect a rural business to my network because of this. Tracklaying is still somehow unintuitive, with weird ""rules"", making some connections impossible. I hope to god this is a bug.

T-splits are still a problem if you want 1 way to merge  and the other way to go paralell to existing tracks. In fact, I have not seen this work at all here, while it did in RE1.

I hope these are the only defects I will run into. But for a release that was supposed to polish old systems it didn't quite do enough polishing for me. Again, hopefully they will fix this in the future.

The tech tree is still gated behind time, and just that. Time. Universities do not increase innovation points gain anymore. This should have been different. Make it so that you can hire researchers or whatever, or make it dependant on how many inhabitants you have connected to your network. Something that gives you some sort of influence over it, so you can strategize it.

But who am I kidding. I LOVE trains. I love the industrial time era. I love this game, despite it's flaws - new and old.

Edit;

I am sorry but I am going to change my review into a no.  This game is just too slow paced. Money is relevant only for the first hour. Train station upgrades are irrelevant since maintainance sheds are mandatory. 

They made a beautiful world, with cities changing, and as time progresses even different kind of wagons for your trains. Yet this is impossible to experience, since it's easily possible to completely cover the full america map within 20 years. I want to start in 1830, and build my way to 1910, fully experiencing the entire era. I want to start with a grasshopper and end with the diesel unit. Start with small cities with wooden cabins, and end with skyscrapers in my cities.Time should move way faster, or at least make it an option when creating a game. (And i don' t mean the 3x button, this is still slow as f*ck).

As for the stations I would solve it like this: 1-2 rail stations = 1 upgrade. 3-4 rails = 2 upgrades. 5-6 = 3 upgrades, and 7-8 rails = 4 upgrades. However, i understand it is not always feasible to have an 8 way rail station, so another solution would be to simply have every station include a maintainance shed (this could even be an on/off option with a checkbox somehwere) as standard on your station and not have it take space for a relevant upgrade, since it's basically a chore and little money drain to place them. 

Even with inflation on high and AI on advanced, it was still easily possible to take them over within 10 years. I still have more than enough money. I would not have a clue on how to solve this, but somehow this was way better balanced in RE1. Pls bring that balance back.

Oh and another thing. Buildings in the cities? there is really only 1 feasible option and thats the university. And who thought it would be a good idea to make it impossible for cities to grow beyond 100k unless there is a uni in it? How the hell is this even a mechanic? Remove this entirely please. Make uni's increase innovation points again.

I am sad to say, but after running the tutorials and starting the campaign, I sat down to play tonight and would rather go back and play RE1 again rather than this game. Others have detailed many points of good and bad, so here's some other things no one has mentioned:

- Graphics / Art Style: while technically superior RE2 does not seem to have as much charm as the first one. The styles are similar so I can't describe exactly why, but it feels like the game is sterile visually. The trees are super sharp, but to the point that they are so sharp that it looks harsh. The UI has some QOL improvements, but the gold icons just feel heavy and hard to understand. The original has the same basic style (gold icons, and so one), but is just better executed: it has a warmth and charm to the art style that this just doesn't have.
- Performance: updated graphics have a price, and given the missing charm, I'm not sure the performance hit is worth it. I can tell that movement around the map is just a little more sluggish. Not game-breakingly so on my machine, just enough I notice it.
- Zoom feels strange -- because of the larger maps, the zoom accelerates greatly as you move out or in. While I've only played a couple hours, I never got used to this and it made hard to move around the map. 

There are some definite improvements in track laying, station size, and more (I like being able to transfer items at stations), but they do feel quite small overall. The game itself is basically the same. This is unfortunate.

The key problem for me is price. For $45 (on sale) I should see a big leap forward and want to play this over RE1. But I'd rather sacrifice the minor improvements and go back to RE1. So I'll probably seek a refund.

PROS
- gamepad-enabled
- excellent track-building tools
- detailed economy
- decent graphics
- ride-along camera with horn

CONS
- warehouse mechanics are incomprehensible
- difficulty compared to most strategy/builder games seems a little more difficult (maybe this is a pro?)

Getting a railway off the ground is relatively straightforward. Not going bankrupt due to constant traffic jams and unreliable locomotives is a little more challenging. Trying to figure out where the import goods that show up in the city report actually are seems impossible. I've seen cities claim that they have 30 incoming grain, only to find that they are perennially short. I continue to try and understand the new warehouse mechanics, but I've found it more than a little challenging thus far. Far from impossible, but certainly not a cakewalk.

I played the hell out of the first one, and once I understood the ins and outs of the game, most importantly that it owes a lot to Tycoon but isn't that game, I loved it.

So what's different is they removed certain features and simplified others. And it could be hotly debated on the merits of their changes. It seems that some aspects like multi-tracks and signals have been reworked to be less confusing. Building tracks as well is simplified, but you really need to adjust them or you'll be paying out the nose for the default run. But over all it's easier to do than in the previous title. No juggling of train personal, which I actually kind of enjoyed. Lastly they've also reworked how moving goods/passengers/mail through more than one station so it's kind of easier. But you can still end up with trains refusing to take the cargo if you're not diligent.

So is this a bad game? Not at all, so far I've really had a blast getting a handle on the new changes and features. In fact it's only kind of a sequel to the first IMHO. There's enough changes that if you go in thinking it plays the same and the same strategies work you'll have a really bad time. All I can say is no matter how much you think you know how to play, play the tutorials. Really... play the tutorials.

If you enjoyed RE1 or other train management or logistics games, you'll probably enjoy RE2. The historical setting is a positive as there is a logical progression of technology. Making warehouses an add-on to train stations is probably the single best improvement as it makes everything so much easier to organize. 

Track laying is better but could still be improved. The other tough thing to understand is how to optimize warehouses for efficient distribution across multiple cities - it's not intuitive how to prevent cities with the same resource from just trading it back and forth endlessly. 

Some tips:
* Focusing on passengers early on will give you better profits than freight because most cities will be too small to consume much freight.
* Buying properties early is not as profitable as it was in RE1 because of low freight consumption. Instead, businesses can offer better rewards if you're able to quickly maximize use of their output to other cities.

Overall, the game feels just kid of off.  It's hard to describe, but if you played the first version, maybe you can relate.  The in game camera control is jerky and rigid.  It's hard to get the right pan and zoom, the feel just isn't there.  
The resource management is totally messed up.  For example, I have a meat production in Portland, ME and the warehouse has 24 in stock.  I have a train taking the meat to a warehouse, halfway between Boston and Albany.  The train will pick up 1 meat and drive it to the warehouse and return and pick up 1 more and head back.  Albany is starving for meat, but the train just picks up 1 at a time?  Why?
Others have pointed out that the 2 building limit is dumb, why even bother having the other options, nobody is gong to choose anything other than maintenance and warehouse.  Also, in the campaign, when you reach 100,000 people in Albany the game gives you the goal of building a university, but you have to tear down the library you built earlier, because you can only have 1 building per city?  Like, what?  That is how cities grow, by adding multiple specialty buildings, not tearing them down to build something different.  So, stupid.  
I've only played about 20 hours and the train management is already a mess, I am having a hard time keeping the lines organized, the paths are hard to see and the names of the routes don't make sense, so you have to rename stuff.  
The employee management is stupid, just take it out of the game, if that's all its going to be, just a percentage of staffing based on funding.  The old people management was fun and had a point and you could organize the crew, now its not even visible.
You used to be able to scroll through the cities with a left and right arrow, now you need to click each city or use the city menu, it was 1000 times easier in the old game, all you needed to do was click through them, just like the trains,
The stats on the trains are harder to see and react to now, there is less information, so, you just kind of let all the trains do whatever and there isn't much tweaking to do other than add or remove a stop.  
The track management is supposed to be easier, but to be honest it's kind of a mess.  You need to build these long entryways and the further you go from the first platform the more the train line costs, so there is little point in trying to plan ahead your in and out points, just choose the track closest to the station and work down, I guess. is what you need to do.
In general, I just don't really care for the look and feel of the game. It's not smooth or intuitive and kind of annoying to play, not fun and relaxing.  The music is bad too.",1688781212,1688781212,False,10,0,0.596883952617645264,0,True,False,False

In order to understand this review, one must first wind back the clock to post RE1 as detailed below

I found myself mostly using the sandbox/freestyle mode, but the one with cash, i didn't want unlimited funds, i wanted to learn the game.
At some point or another i found i simply didn't have enough station platforms to load and unload trains, usually operating with 2 stations and 2 warehouses either side of the city which would probably mean 16 platforms max, and it seemed sluggish and a lot of work to improve the flow of traffic/goods once you reached a certain point.

I am very happy to announce that things have changed subtly, but sure enough so you know its a new game with different features, but it still plays the same, just more simplified and easy to manage.

Best improvements are 8 possible platforms per station, the gridiron system, or when connecting 2 cities from platform 1 at each city will then bring up a bubble, and upon clicking this bubble it gives you the option of instantly doubling up your platform 1 track and placing it between platform 2 at each station super handy when needed.

(TLDR) Staff tab settings are for adjusting a persistent bonus multiplier to all trains rather than depending on being able to hire a specific crewman, ""Dominant security guard"" or a ""Careless conductor"" as examples.

(Original long version) as much as i liked messing around with the staff on each train and trying to get a harmonious team for the bonus multiplier, it has been removed and this is a good thing, the staff tab is now where you can essentially set company policy, by setting the wages/training/quality to give an overal bonus, you can set these for each individual staff member type/class, engineer/stoker etc but you never deal individually with 1 staff member, it is a top down policy that stays in place and all staff are then boosted by this consistently without any staff members clashing which forces you to ""shuffle"" your teams around so they give a good bonus.

Recommend this game so far, true  enough to the original, but addresses a few of the niggly bits although i have only put 56 hours into it at the time of writing, most of that was just doing what i did on the old game and sitting back and watching it. But i am very interested in this new co-op option.... this could be interesting! 
I have a game scheduled tonight for a short while with the intention of resuming tomorrow and seeing how far we get.

I have to be honest, i am sceptical of the mode, operating the same railroad and using the same cash.....
but this could be good, 2 heads could be better than 1, and it will give us something to talk about and laugh, rather than talking about each others rails, we will be discussing OUR rails, and that seems rather wholesome provided you are not playing with a troll.

Wish me luck, but based on what i have seen, this is an excellent follow up to the original i would say, faithful yet not afraid to try new things, thank you!

1 more thing, graphically it looks pretty awesome, hard to remember, but i am fairly certain the graphics have been stepped up, i was looking at a random tile and it had a deer or something on it, and the dynamic seasonal changes looked nice even if impractical for building and managing railways, so i keep that season setting turned off until its needed and i can sit back and relax and watch the railway run itself and the cities grow!",1688754962,1688754962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first and obvious thing is the improvement in graphics – everything is much prettier, and the stupid cartoon people have gone. But also, the whole game has been greatly streamlined. Laying out track is much easier, and generally, any sort of micromanagement has been automated, so the game now focusses on strategic decision making about how you plan your rail network.

The game still has a number of rough edges that need smoothing out, especially as regards sound design. There is a really horrible crashing sound that plays anywhere near a station, and some other sounds tend to get stuck. There are some oddities regarding a lack of localisation – resources are the same everywhere, so you find towns in Britain wanting maize (“corn”) which they never did, and even worse, it only grows in Ireland.

There is one major problem to do with time scales. Technology development is gated by decade, so if you start in 1830, you can’t access developments that are restricted to 1840 onwards. The trouble is, by about 1836 you have researched every single development for the 1830s. So for the next years you continue to get research points that you can’t spend.

There is a waypoint issue. If using WP the cargo from one station to WP to another station cancelling the loading cargo.

SUGGESTIONS
- The prices for cargoes if the station is close or far are the same. Maybe the same happens for passengers and mail. This is not realistic. Must be calculated the freight rates depense the distance from station to station.
- There is not reason the train to stopping to a station for example grain station if has all wagons full. It's better no stopping and continue the voyage to the next station.
- The train that always awaiting to increase distance from the forward one it's dramatic. A better AI train traffic rerquired. There is not reason the trains stopping. It's more better to calculate their speed and always moving.
- The game is not following realtime play. If the distance from one station to another is for example 100Km and the speed of the train is 20Km/h need 5 hours voyage and not days. Also that one is not realistic.

If any developer read that message please reply regarding suggestions. The game is not bad, but it's not realistic also.

A game in the tradition of RRT2, but with maps that give a larger sense of scale and a better developed rail layout and economic engine.

I want to say that this is not a huge upgrade on RE1, but I simply do not care. If you like train games, you support train games, and that's all there is to it. I'm sure I'll get dozens of hours of value out of this, so it's worth the price of entry.

There are several game systems that have been refined. I think managing lines rather than individual trains is a big improvement. Rail layout is improved vs. RE1 v1.0. The new warehouse approach is IMO better than RE1.

One the other hand, there are still some UI kinks to work out. But I have not experienced any game breaking bugs and I'm grateful for that.

- I like the new camera mode. It's much better than it was in the first game.
- I like, overall, the new track construction features, like the parallel track building or the automatic placement of signals.
- I like the fact that you can paint the locomotives using custom colors. I still wish I could paint each individual locomotive separately, but I understand why that would be too much.

Things I don't like about the game:
- No night time mode. It was vital to me to be able to play the game better, and it's not there.
- The thing I miss the most from the first game is, no signal boxes. I get why they would be a nightmare to manage and would probably murder even the most powerful CPU, but I still miss them.
- I don't like the limited keyboard support. Some of the hot keys were missing even from the first game, like the ability to pan the camera up and down without using the mosuse. But there are hot keys that existed in the first game that weren't even implemented in this one, and that's baffling to me. Also, why am I not able to hit a button to create a new train route? I don't think anyone can explain that oversight, and have a reasonable explanation for it.

Overall I enjoy the game, because I love trains, and I would recommend it. I only play it in sandbox mode, because the only thing I care about is to have a giant train set to play with. And this game delivers that in a pretty good way.",1687634965,1687634965,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most noticeable improvements involve quality of life updates, the overall scope of the game feeling meatier, and a welcome coat of realism polish. Maps feel more expansive as well.

Par for the Railroad Tycoon genre, there are familiar gripes, almost all related to how 'micro' the management is to be successful... One example is laying tracks, considering the apparent encouragement to double track more that RE1. It would be nice to have a ""lay double track"" option, auto-including the junctions and direction settings. Another example is manually setting which goods can be stored at each warehouse... I personally don't see where the fun begins; isn't that what warehouse managers are for?

(EDIT: The new auto-signaling does have some benefits, and once I got familiar with it, it's much less tedious now... They're also adding manual signaling in an upcoming update).

The landscapes flirt with being awe-inspiring, yet are limited by the ""always mid-day sunny"" lighting... Some weather effects, day/night cycles would be huge (I haven't seen any yet, so I may be wrong).

I got in after 1st patch and have had no technical issues, though I'd expect more patches for polish and balance.

All said, it is very much the latest and greatest, and makes many steps (however small) in many right directions.

You decide on (painfully obvious) routes between cities and villages (that solely produce timber, for example). If you like the genre, it is a decent, if somewhat uninspired addition. A major improvement is that one doesn't have to put all the signs in manually, although in an upcoming update (see: roadmap) this feature will be returned for those who enjoy putting in the signs manually. Compared to Railroad Tycoon the game fails to really engage with the shenanigans of shares and mergers. The economy is a Potemkin village. However, unlike RRT, trains don't 'fade out' in order to allow passage. If your signs aren't properly placed, everything will grind to a halt until you fix things. However, with the automated signs this should never be an issue. 

The graphics are OK. Not brilliant, but not ugly, either. One thing that I enjoy is the ability to change the paint scheme of each and every available locomotive. I spent some time putting in historically accurate paint schemes for various companies.

Summary
It's just missing something to give satisfaction.  It's just, well, slow.  At the most basic level, I think it's that there is no satisfaction with cities - they just seem like overcrowded towns, satisfying them is like having a bad girlfriend - a constant game of frantic appeasement and catch up, there no sense that they really seem happy.

The Bad
Sounds are lack luster, and I want to shoot those bloody dogs who bark incessantly in every city, and there is no no day/night option (like there is in RE1).  Basic things like falling snow and rain would be expected today at this pricepoint, but there is none of that, and bugs like cities suddenly stopping accepting a type of goods despite needing them (and then consequently shrinking or not growing) means there are problems under the hood which need to be addressed.

The Good
The cartoon people and ridiculous train by train staffing of RE1 are gone - and good riddance. 
If you play long enough, the cities begin to look like something other than unkempt, grass-filled shanty villages inhabited by hoards of shambling zombies, the trains are actually better than a three legged donkey with a bad attitude, and you get used to a unconvincing scales and distances, it becomes quite pleasant to connect the more tricky locations and watch the action and the money rolling in.  

Conclusion
At this point it's not worth the price - but if $ is no object, give it a try.  Once they patch it up and add some functionality (at least put back what is already in RE1) I think it'll be a decent sequel.",1685726134,1687290444,False,1,0,0.506507575511932373,0,True,False,False

Love the game, it draws you in for hours on end. I had to leave a recommended review because there appears to be this phenomenon when a game comes out and people first play it, they seem to lack basic comprehension skills and trash on the developers. I almost did not buy this game because of the Mixed reviews at the time, but after watching the devs play, I had a felling that that most of the negative reviews were bogus. So I bought it and though it's a little pricier than I wanted in this economy, they deserve every penny. 16h and not a single bug encountered, so please take those reviews with a grain of salt. Saying things like ""idk why my train won't deploy or move, therefore the game sucks"" speaks more to those players not paying attention to the tutorial or bothering to spend more than a minute trying to figure out what they are doing wrong. Sure, GMS could do a bit more hand holding and provide a bit more tooltip info as to why certain things happen, but this is something that can still be added later, and if you actually investigate a little, you'll probably figure out what you were doing wrong in the first place. There's also comments about the signals/lights not changing in a realistic way. I get there's prly train set collectors out there, but having your CPU compute and keep track of all of those changes could have a significant impact on performance, especially when you've grown your railway empire a bit and you start noticing how many different track signals are generated. And then you'd have complaints about performance, which is far less desirable. Again, something that could be perhaps be added later, but if you play the game for more than a few hours, you won't really have much time to notice it anyway, since you'll be too busy building your rail network.
Buy it, you have 2h to decide if you're addicted to it.

After a while you understand the logic of the pending requests in each city and how it affects the deliveries. These request lines can go over many warehouses and could take a while to fulfill (even if working fine). If they are not fine and if delivery lines in between are underpowered the whole chain gets broken. Connecting trains are not picking up these long-range goods and might concentrate on closer supply lines - and you cannot add arbitrary number of trains, of course. Once the network is clogged up, it doesn't help to provide a closer source to a request as they seem to be never re-calculated. Once it is done and shipping is on its way, it MUST be fulfilled. This probably explains most of the weird situations where a city is starving and shrinking while the grain business in the neighborhood piles up wares and debt. In general, these situations are often solvable by providing more direct lines between the warehouse where the stuff is located and the users. Unfortunately, a) this is breaking the good idea of self-organizing goods flow (which is really nice, if it works) and b) does the game do a horrible job in supporting to spot and solve these situations.

Why is the supplier/demand overview so underpowered. If I see in a city that it has requested 20 boxes of grain and they are nowhere to be found, why is there no visual representation if I click in the goods overview on grain and the city? The city gets a yellow circle and that’s it. I need to see where they are requested from and, maybe that is already one step to a solution, be able to cancel certain requests to get them requested again from the fresh closer source. If not other possible, the cancelled goods could just vanish or be thrown away like Amazon returns. 

Maybe better would even be if the game could do that itself. Constantly evaluate where the goods are best to get from and reorganize the flow and reassign the recipients. I could think of a system where the game would not calculate each delivery but more tries to calculate supply lines. The productions and demands are in general quite stable (in terms of tons/week) and thus sources could always try to prefer feeding closer demands instead of trying to support everyone with its relative share. Of course, this probably introduces new problems when supplies are silently shifted because of city growth or industry creation - maybe this could be fixed with better statistics, overlays, colors and drill-down lists. I don't know, they might have tried something like this, and it and it didn't work, maybe it contradicts other concepts or doesn't appeal the target audience.

Twice I had it, that the requests were just obviously broken. A city claimed to have requested 60-90 boxes of almost all goods in question and never received (or requested again) anything. The only solution was to kill the whole train station and rebuild it in the same spot. Annoying and tedious. Here also a “reset requests” button would have helped.

I just finished chapter 4 and will put it aside now before starting chapter 5. Maybe this requestor-network gets an update until then. It still is a good game and I’ll return to it. 

BTW: While I understand the restriction to 6 goods in a warehouse to enforce a minimum of complexity, I do not understand the restriction to two station buildings. In normally situations you do not even have a choice there as Maintenance is so annoyingly mandatory and warehouses are needed in each bigger city.

The reviews I've read seem to be either totally negative or totally positive. That just seems phony to me. Here are my thoughts...Good game. Not great, but good. There are many good aspects and improvements. I, for one, like that the track laying is a bit easier. I'm ok with the comp doing some of the minutia, such as signals and such. I am also very pleased with the widening of the scope, for lack of a better way of putting it. What is is that the spacing and distance between cities allows for wyes to be more compact and allow for more flexibility on how you lay your tracks. It was always extremely frustrating, in RE1, trying to fit connections and switches in tight spaces when i'm thinking to myself ""oh come on, there is actually a couple hundred miles between these cities yet I can't even connect 2 freaking rail lines. That issue has essentially been eliminated and THAT alone is a fantastic improvement. Obviously graphics are better and that's good, though my poor, old computer suffers from that a bit. Oh well, tech only moves one direction so time for an upgrade on the comp I suppose. I don't quite have the full understanding of the new warehouse system, but I think I like it. The fact that the WH is a part of the station is great, and eliminates a lot of the compact frustration I talked about earlier. I think I like the new system much better. I'm not sure if I like the emphasis on rail lines rather than individual trains, but I haven't had any traffic issues yet, and it seems to work fine, so I will table that judgement for now.

Now for the bad...while the research element of RE1 had it's flaws, it was way better than RE2. This also gets into the time scaling, which I am very bummed about. Yes, in RE1 I would have locos far earlier than historically available, but I have my favorite locos, like everyone. While I got to Consolidations, Mallets, Berkshires, Mikados, etc. far faster, I would end up using them forever, and not upgrading to the last ""level"" of locos until very close to the historical timeframe. I just like having my favorite locos. Sue me. This is my biggest problem with RE2. Well, along with the time scaling, which i'll talk about in a moment. I have all the research for the 1830s done years early, and find myself just sitting there waiting, for years, to get to the next tech developments. That really sucks. Especially since the 10 year ""segments"" mean that i'm going to have to have locos that I have no real interest in, for God knows how long before I get to ones i am interested in. I think the 1860s are when I start getting to ones I like. From an actual in game time perspective, to get to those later locos, it's completely ridiculous. In that respect, I thought RE1 was about right. You could focus on locos and get to your favorite ones, OR be more ""historical"" and research the other techs as you moved through the locos and keep to a relatively historical timeline. The option of getting to your favorite locos quickly has been completely eliminated. That sucks...a lot. 

That brings me to the time scaling. It's not good at all, in my opinion. So I set out to build the Baltimore & Ohio system, as accurately as I could (much easier on RE2 than 1 I should mention). I should mention that I typically play in custom mode because my joy in the game is building systems, not dealing with idiot AI competitors, yet I do find it far too easy in sandbox mode. Gotta have some limitations to make it fun. So even with the 3 mil starting point, and not making it any easier with gameplay settings, I have the whole dang system built and it isn't even 1840. I am making tons of money but have nowhere to go but ahistorical, and again, it's not even 1840 yet. WTF am I supposed to do for the next 90 years? I even tried to be relaxed and take my time, but still...done by 1840. This is the single biggest flaw in this game, in my opinion. It seems extraordinarily out of balance when combined with the research issue. I could have a coast to coast, Mexico to Canada system and still be years away from even having 2-8-0 Consolidations. That just seems really screwed up. Sure, I could start the game at 1860, but them i'm cheating myself out of game time. This just seems very out of whack.

My other issue is with the locos themselves. Look, I'm an American. I'm not really interested in European locos. Sorry. i'm just not, but they're forced on me now. The answer is simple...MORE LOCOS. If you don't want to separate the tech tree then add more to it. Pair American and Euro locos, in the tech tree, or something. I imagine there are European gamers who don't have much interest in American locos. How about putting Euro locos with Euro maps and American locos with American maps. Just a thought, but I think it would enhance the game a ton. I mean, how can you cut out the most popular freight loco of the late steam period, the Mikado? 

Beyond all of that, I don't know why they don't develop a diesel era add on. I mean, come on man. Yes, steam is steam, and is wonderful, but some of us would like more. Think about it. Just a 50 year expansion pack, ""The Diesel Era"" or something like that. The tech tree for this would be beyond easy for the developers to do. Steam enthusiasts would be free not to purchase it, and it would provide so much more entertainment for folks like me, who have only lived in the diesel era, and appreciate diesel loco development. Come on y'all.

The improvements are big in this new version. The graphics are really nice. Picking your CEO and Setting up your Company is much nicer. 
A couple of big improvements I've seen so far is that when building railways the game takes care of signals. It could be a bit tedious in the original game. I don't miss at all having to set up signals manually. I really like the H hotkey to turn on ground elevations so you can see more easily where to avoid running tracks. 
The other big one for me is warehouses. Now they really work like warehouses should work. They setup product forwarding to other cities that need certain products so your other railway lines will automatically start loading those products in warehouses to go to cities in need along their route.

1. The warehouse setup is different which is ok not bad not good.
2. Signals are totally different which wouldn't be to bad if you had the option to run single track and simply have trains pass each other with no collision. the signals are automatic but require a double track, either a full length or siding. The problem comes when you have a spur line (single track and train) trying to cross or join a busy main line to feed a station. you can't place a signal on the single spur line close to the junction so when a gap in the main line presents itself the spur line train can cross or join the main. As it is, the spur line train will wait in the station at the end of the spur at the loading point (farm etc). it needs to be addressed. 
3. Maintenance is done on track in station which is odd because you literally have a engine a engine shed. It would be nice if they could make it so the engine is placed in the shed for maintenance and free up the line for other trains.

4. the grid iron feature was kinda in railway empire 1 and it worked fine. its changed now and you must build tracks out for enough (depending on how many lines you want) to grid iron. 
5. the station have the ability to have many lines added as you need which is great. it really is.
6. the train AI seems to struggle, having multiple lines available at station (attached via grid iron) to select a empty line and the train sometimes will not choose an available line and will stop on the main and choke the line up. You can manually tell it what line to go to , but it will not travel to any other line if you use this option.

the freight  system is different, in my opinion its much worse. stock piling freight is near impossible as the train will not take cargo to a warehouse if there is no demand on the receiving end. 
Trains often run half full or less even though there is cargo at the station that needs to go to the destination city. especially if its a settlement. such as miami. i'll have a warehouse full of logs wheat and meat. and my train will only take maybe one or 2 of each. even though miami needs much more. You can order the train to wait but it will occupy a track and prevent that lines use. The train quite often just sits and sits and sits and doesn't take any more.

I would recommend transport fever 1 & 2 over this. The economy is far worse than railway empire 1. The re1 economy was straight forward. this is all over. eg. a train from Chicago to Indianapolis in 1 of the scenarios . i run 2 trains and both lose money. so i scrap 1 and then the 1 have left loses money. even though this is part of the objective. the train is a multi use/freight and pass.  all the trains i use to supply the towns run negative.

Just had another issue with the train not delivering in demand freight to the settlement of dodge city. they need lumber,wheat,and meat. i have a warehouse full of the 3 in Kansas and witchita . my trains will not pull any to dodge city and the can't progress because the campaign simply runs out of time.

2. A limit of two buildings per station is retarded. It's always Maintenance and a warehouse for freight and nothing else because the vast majority of cities have at least one resource line coming in that must have maintenance, and you must use a warehouse because it's not feasible to build mega platforms at every resource for all the trains that need that resource.
3. A limit of 6 items per warehouse is ridiculous once you have a lot of cities. Delivering late game goods becomes a nightmare that makes the game tedious and annoying. Tie it to city size and allow upgrades.
4. A lot more attention needs to be given to how the game mechanics play out when dealing with a lot of cities and train lines.
5. The way the game chooses where to get a resource from does not evolve along with your expansion. This causes major headaches that are not easy to see or find.

Attempting to add a ""challenge"" by creating contrived and illogical limits like two buildings for station makes no sense, adds no value, and removes an expected and satisfying progression path from the game.

Maybe if time went more quickly, maybe if technology was researched faster, maybe if new stuff showed up more frequently, I suppose the devs should have a look into this.

Railway Empire 2 is a game developed by Gaming Minds Studios and published by Kalypso Media Digital

The game has some really beautiful environments and the graphics are really well designed and laid out. The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nontheless

The game also suffers with some weird bugs and glitches which the developer seemed to have overlooked but they don't hinder the game at all

Railway Empire 2 overall, however, is a fun game to play in short bursts and a good-ish simulation game to play especially if you like games that simulate running a railway empire such as this one!

The price yea a little on the high side but I think its what you do that matters, we didn't have multiplayer but now we do that is a hard thing to work out so overall the cost isn't the worse thing.  I heard some complaint about the gridiron, I love the gridiron in this game vs paying the 200k to auto setup rails to push them into the right lanes.  I love the fact I have 8 possible rail lines in a grand station.  I love the fact that you can make a full bridge with 8 rail lines vs the first one that had a limit of 2 that were able to be built together (hated that fact, had to build some weird railways that way in the first one). The rail line concept was one of the cleanest concepts that took me a moment to grasp probably because I don't remember it in the first one, the fact I can auto add trains to the same rail line and then i can toggle through them to see what was going on was great. The fact the utilization actually works is also great,  in the first game the loads would tell you you need x amount per week to keep things afloat but they never mathematically added up. So the utilization was great so I didn't have to overcompensate on the routes to make sure enough product for the factories worked. warehouse as an extension of the station was cool, didn't have to pay 200k to get a large warehouse just needed to target the right place.  The fact you can make any stop really a transfer stop with the hotels was cool.  the auto hiring of personnel was interesting. 

Some things I didn't necessarily like but were okay, the fact you now have to pay for the special freight cars to increase the overall haul of your loads. You got those Scott free in the first one but I never fully utilized them. The characters aren't as memorable I feel as the original ones.  The bond system may be broken in the sense that if you take a top tier bond vs taking the shorter tier bond you can technically start 2 of them when the higher value, longer period seems to only allow one.  The unlocking things as part of research such as steel and confectionery and stuff seems like why?  Do the cities need it if I don't research it, then why do I need to research it?  Extension limit of 2 for a grand station seems smol, it's a grand station maybe 3?

Some wishes here the stock market bonds tell you little about anything, the documentation on the refrigerated car is kind of dated?  Why does it apply to vegetables but not corn? Thought it was just any food stuffs really in the old one.

To the ones talking about you can't do things the way you want, you totally can they still have the waypoint system, used that multiple times in the campaign to make freight lines take the slower routes for my express trains.  The express trains now make actual sense on how to get them to express status, maintenance isn't counted into the metric anymore it never made sense to count it as part of the metric. 

All in all I think it was good, if you are torn on price maybe wait a little, yea it doesn't have  a ton in it yet but it'll get better.  That being said they're loading on platform 9, and I'm going to miss my train.",1686688346,1686688346,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Another strong feature is the option to use contour maps when building coupled with a very easy to use method of changing track elevations.  This allows the user to avoid costly bridges or tunnels or to simply optimize earthwork costs.  The use of the switch section is a bit klunky.  It works well on simple double track links but gets fiddly when you want to link in a freight line sometimes requiring you to double track a freight line the really only need a single track line. So the strength of this game is in the rail building.

Once the building is done you have to rely on a very weak AI for automatic loading of your trains. The AI is supposed to be helped by the use of warehouses but those are subject to the same weak AI making suboptimal to nonsensical decisions about what is to be shipped.  This can be corrected by using manual loading of trains and this becomes a must in many situations.

Then there are the computer opponents which are very poorly written. The computer opponents don't sppear to play by the same economic or even physical rules the player is constrained by.  The computer player appears to just draw lines on the map without logic or plan.  The AI for computer opponents is so lame that I suggest you play with 0 competition.

Trains break down a lot and they are the expected pain when they do.  Fortunately you can train your engineers and build maintenance shops to mitigate this dramatically.  Unfortunately every station can only have two additional facilities so most cities will use one for a maintenance shop leaving only one for other purposes.  This never increases in the game.  Then inexplicably the maintenance shops do not top off the fluids when they maintain an engine?!??

So, if you like rail building and don't really care as much about operations, I don't think you can find a better game.",1686623846,1686635275,True,4,0,0.510950803756713867,0,True,False,False

The graphics aren't bad for the price point, and the individualised narrators for each scenario provide a nice bit of colour.

This game is better than the first for the new track laying capabilities alone. The warehouses are an improvement in my opinion.

I would agree with the other reviews that say this game seems like an extended patch of RE1, and the AAA price tag makes that a bit of a difficult pill to swallow.

Two major points: to players, make sure you have as little gradient as possible. Especially in early game. Weak trains don't do hills very well, taking up extra time you could be making money. This is a bigger issue than speed limits on turns. Don't do 2% when 1% will do. Don't do 1% when you can achieve 0%. Don't do 1% on the whole track when you can do 1% on just half the track. BUT ALSO don't push it right to the edge of where it changes between one % and the next. When you add multiple tracks the newer ones may not get the same gradients. Also don't worry about earthwork costs when adjusting gradients, you'll make that up over time with faster trains. But DO worry about bridges and tunnels. THOSE are expensive.

To developers: *Bug report: something around 10% to 15% of the time a train will skip a destination.* Returning to the farm loaded with grain, for example. When it turns around there, it is considered as having made a full circuit, complete with weekly costs added. The only work-around I have for this is for one-off shipments, not regular loads.

I know a lot of folks are finding the price disagreeable and frankly I'm inclined to agree that it's overpriced, but at the end of the day I do quite enjoy it and I'm glad I bought it. Port Royale 4 was released at the same price point and has since come down, so I wouldn't be surprised if the same happens with with RE2. The one thing I do genuinely find disagreeable though is the extras they're charging for like the compendium, engine catalogue, etc. The information in them is indeed helpful, but at the same time, it's literally just a game manual that should have been included with the base game and not charged 6 bucks a pop for.",1686094417,1686094417,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1644320,139631702,76561198019040566,0,2,150,0,150,1685937680,"Summary - Don't buy Railway Empire 2 and instead, buy Railway Empire 1. (I'll change this review when the game improves. While I've wrote a lot negativity here, I fully enjoy the first game and hope the studio will improve over the first in this new one. Until that time comes, this opinion will hold.).

I'll begin with why for the negative review; between positive and negative, this game leans heavily in the negative format when you strip it down to the gameplay elements in comparison to Railway Empires 1, the first game in this series. 

The Positive;

- Graphics are beautiful for a simulator game, and vast improvement over the first with customization of trains in changing there colour. Minor, but a lovely little feature which is a treat and going further is the detail to the scenery and engines themselves. A great improvement all and all. This is the strongest case for improvement.

The Middle-Ground; 
 
- The track signalling is more streamlined and less central. This is both good & terrible. While the process is easier to manage and conduct, it's a bit iffy if you want total management over the system in play. You lose the ability to set things how you desire in comparison to the first game. While this makes it far easier for new players to the series to grasp the basics, it leaves veterans for the first game frustrated in a strange way? It's a little difficult to explain it. You have this sense of ""Meh, this /isn't/ right..."" when establishing your tracks. 

- The station setup is.. This should be a positive but fails to grasp that area. You have more choice and here, is where the game is lacking overall. The more choices aren't worth it overall in the longer run for scenarios. On the surface, looks impression but doesn't bring anything to the table where you feel the urge in requiring as the differences are minor at most. 

- The gridiron isn't overly useful and it's a hassle to make your own crossovers. The previous system with signal stations was and is superior to this current system as the old way worked far better with custom signalling system than this new automatic way. 

- Little content was added overall in comparison to the first game. Overall, this is akin to a mobile game.

The Negative;

- Content is lacking horribly for the price. For the current price, you can invest in a MMO for a few months/buy AAA title(couple with the sales ongoing)/the first game with other games you enjoy. The current price tag for a game that has less but shiner shell doesn't make for continuation in a series. There is absolutely no grounds for this absurd pricing when the current game is bare-bones, riddled with bugs and less customization in how you manage your railway company. 

- Same train behaviour and bugs from the first game coming over into this proclaimed continuation. When you buy another game in a series that is newer, you expect some features to remain the same while improving or more commonly in these times, being worse than the first. This is one the few times where pricing is steep while the game offers less and while at it, includes all the bugs from the first while adding extra slice of life of new bugs in the new game. 

Trains will always automatically strive for the shortest route. This means they will not change from the route given unless it's manual order. To newer players this doesn't seem bad until you're trying to avoid traffic with simple and easier means through sidelines. For example, when setting up a supply station for fuel/water, you typically have a sideline in the game to avoid this and prevent traffic piling up on the mainline. (In real life, the station itself is usually placed on a sideline to prevent the mainline getting clogged but it's a game, let's leave this aspect out of it.. Ahem.). 

Here, to get around in this issue in the first game. You'd make 8/4 tracks where the train AI would avoid(basically, you fooled the train AI to work as you'd expect it) but you can't in this one due to the automatic signalling. 

- More choice doesn't always equal good. At the moment, in date with this review, the addons for stations aren't always working as they're supposed to. Sometimes the bonus doesn't work, other times, it does but again, isn't viable as you'll be using the same setup the majority of the time which renders all the other options moot outside scenarios/campaign when a task purposely insists you do this. Then you do it, and quickly remove them straight after completing the objective! 

- I'm adding this into the negative side solely as it's the biggest complaint by the community this far while I personally enjoy it, I find myself leaning into the majority for hating the lack of option on speed. The faster option is supposedly x3 but continues at a snail's pace. The game recommends you zoom-out and.. Continues to move at a somewhat faster pace? It isn't noticeable in the earlier time-periods with how slow the engines are to begin with. In all, this issue needs to sorted and adjusted rapidly. 

- AI.. Boy, oh boy, the AI and.. Everything in relation to your rivals is wacky. This area is difficult to get into how unfathomably stupid the AI is. They're supposed to give you some sense of a challenge or keep you on your toes for expansion but it's like nipping into your local store for a few items. You grab what you want, easy and quickly, then go to queue at the checkout but find it's easier to use the self-service as the two in front are too busy talking. In a nutshell; you can either stand in queue and be there for days waiting for the AI to do something /useful/ or go about your own business with it doing nothing. That isn't fun. Isn't engaging. You might as well let us buy the AI out at the right start of the game and we can remove the deadweight to begin playing properly. 

- Price! I've made mention but hear me out here. Until the developers begin using there fingers for making adjustments to the game rather than picking their noses. Don't buy this game. In it's current stage, it's a flop and the first game while older and less graphically inclined is a bundle of fun where you can move at a slower pace or not. The AI is better equipped, both games are practically using the game engines and time periods. The biggest differences are between these two games are; you have less polish on the surface but far more under the hood. That old banger might not have aged well but by god, she's sweeter and knows how to purr. 

Railway Empire 2 is overreaching and my only regret is buying the deluxe edition as I wanted to further support the studio but I can't recommend this game to players until fundamental changes are made. Right now, it's similar to early access game and comes across as a scam. This my opinion, take or leave it. Early access status is desperately required as this feels honest-to-good scam when held under the spotlight.

As a little side-noted, since this game was released. I've find myself playing the first one constantly solely for the content and fun it brings over supposedly better RW2.

Building upon the success of its predecessor, Railway Empire, this sequel showcases an array of remarkable changes that breathe fresh life into the railroad empire-building experience.

One of the most outstanding improvements in Railway Empire 2 is the enhanced graphics and visual fidelity. The landscapes are now more detailed and immersive, transporting players into a rich and vibrant world filled with picturesque cities, lush countrysides, and breathtaking natural vistas. The level of realism achieved in Railway Empire 2 is truly commendable, making each journey through the vast railway networks an awe-inspiring spectacle.

Another notable enhancement is the refined gameplay mechanics. Railway Empire 2 introduces a host of new features that elevate the strategic depth and challenge of managing a railway empire. From the intricate track-laying system that offers greater flexibility in designing and optimizing routes to the expanded roster of locomotives and rolling stock, the game truly captures the essence of running a complex railway network.

One aspect that sets Railway Empire 2 apart is the comprehensive and engaging campaign mode. The narrative-driven campaigns present players with diverse scenarios and objectives, challenging them to overcome historical events, economic crises, and rival tycoons. The captivating storylines, coupled with well-crafted missions, keep players immersed in their quest to become the ultimate railroad magnate.

Moreover, Railway Empire 2 introduces a robust multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete and cooperate with friends and railway enthusiasts worldwide. This multiplayer functionality adds a new layer of excitement and collaboration, as players can team up to tackle larger projects or engage in cutthroat competition to dominate the railway industry.

The user interface and overall user experience have also received significant improvements in Railway Empire 2. Navigating menus, managing resources, and overseeing operations have become much more intuitive and streamlined. The developers have clearly put great effort into ensuring that players can focus on the strategic aspects of the game without being overwhelmed by complex controls or cluttered interfaces.

In conclusion, Railway Empire 2 is a true masterpiece that revolutionizes the railway simulation genre. With its stunning visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, captivating campaigns, and multiplayer functionality, the game offers an immersive and unforgettable experience for both seasoned players and newcomers alike. Whether you're a history enthusiast, a strategic mastermind, or simply someone who appreciates well-crafted simulation games, Railway Empire 2 is an absolute must-play.

The various quality of life improvements and changes from the first game add up to a pretty substantial difference I think. It feels much more like I'm focused on the actual design of my rail network, with less time spent fiddling with individual tracks to get them to actually behave the way I want them to. There is still a little bit of that, but it's much smoother overall.

Graphics are noticeably improved, although to me that doesn't really matter for this kind of game.

Not too sure where all the hate is coming from. It's not cheap, but priced a little lower than AAA games which I think is fair given the amount of hours I'm going to get out of it. No issues at all with the price given the amount of content. The ""Guide"" DLCs are terrible value, so don't buy them.

It's basically a reskin of the first game where the graphics are better, it runs better, the track building is easier, and the cities seem a lot more alive compared to the older one. Other than that, too soon to say. If you liked the original and the price isn't off putting I think you'd get your hours out of this one.

Update: I've put a few more hours into it and I figured I'd update my review. This is indeed more of the same with many improvements. Tracks snap and place a lot easier, hiring people is generally automatic and controlled by the size of your company and your tech tree...which makes it much less infuriating as the original with planting people on individual trains. Making different direction tracks is a lot easier too. 
If I had to mention any negatives it would be the progression speed and the tech tree needs to be balanced, badly. The tech tree is locked in 10 year increments. If you start in 1830 you have access to maybe a dozen or so techs for the 1830s and then you can't unlock any further tech until you hit 1840 and so on up until the 1900s. That said, I find myself maxing the tree out and having to fast forward 4-5 years each decade to get further down the tech tree. Not a major problem but it sort of messes up the immersion. Another issue is cosmetic. Some upgrades, like getting a roof over the engineer are available but you do not see the physical change to the engines which is kinda of disappointing in an otherwise lovely game. 
Lastly, I'm not too sure about the towns at this point. They are 'alive' or much more so than the original to be sure but their size scale is very small. Not much visual difference between a town of 100k people and one of 20k in my play thus far. Not a deal breaker but its that immersion thing again. Who knows, maybe it gets better. 

tl;dr : Great game. It's the original with a new engine basically and it's easier to use. I didn't have a problem buying it at full price but if you wait a few months and let the developers work on the odds and ends I really don't think anyone into games like this would be disappointed.",1685327807,1686010317,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Right now, I only have positive things to say about the game because it is new, and clearly a starting point for new expansions in the future.  I'm also humble enough to realize that a lot of my early frustrations went away after enough game play, and by watching videos of better players discussing some of the mechanics, and things that can trip you up when you're still in an RE1 mindset.

A lot of the most tedious parts of the gameplay have been fixed in this sequel.  Messing around with upgrading station size is a thing of the past, as you can now build up to 8 platforms, and three stations in a city.  Why might someone build 3 stations in a city?  Because it's the maximum number of stations you can build, allowing you to deny entry to another player.

Signals, which were an annoyance, are also gone.  Simply lay down tracks, choose their travel direction, and go.  When you create a train line, you can easily see the exact route it has to take, which is helpful to see if you can/should build another route, or if you've properly set up all the mechanics, like the gridirons, and water towers.  

Your rural stops are now even more useful with their potential as passenger transfer points with a hotel, with warehouses to keep your routes more efficient (and tracks less clogged), and other ammenities to provide different bonuses or provide maintenance for your trains.  I'm hoping with expansions and DLCs they further increase the abilty to customize cities and train stations, and offer more (and better) improvements to them as the decades proceed.

Two last things to keep in mind:  First, time moves slower.  Speeds are Pause, 1X, and 3X.  Embrace the more realistic speeds.  The second thing, if you're encountering a problem--it's probably you and not a bug.  A lot of these reviews indcate players either didn't do the tutorial, they didn't seek out answers online, and that they frusterate easily.  There are videos.  There are forums.  There are tutorials.  Use them.

For a game that isn't overly technical, and doesn't require a ton of micromanaging, the game is still challenging, fun, and will provide many hours of fun.  Kalypso makes games that are accessible to all players.  If you really enjoy micromanaging, and tedium, try going into accounting.

The warehouse system has much more functionality and allows for clean well-organized lines. So planning the distribution of goods is actually planning, not seeing how many trains you can cram into a single station. Stations automatically use all available platforms. The station extensions are a welcome addition.
I don't mean to offend, but I believe many of the early negative reviews were the result of judging too hastily and rushing to get a refund before it was too late. The game has nuances that its predecessor did not and these need to be learned before game play makes sense.

The developers must be Swedish. Why? because you build your tracks and the drivers get smacked in the mush by several overhanging trees. Do I think it's worth the money. To be honest NO. In today's market it is overpriced. But if like me, you enjoy railway games, then this is worth looking at.

First, these guys and Transport fever's developers need to sit down and make Transport Empire. The arcade nature of this game has flavor and historical heart that makes it fun. TF is pure magical logistics. Put them together and ya get the magic of the tycoon games of old. separate they are at times too niche for their own good. 

second, they do have heart. At much as the scandi doing american accent manager dude sounds just campy to my american ears, its fun to have him piss of the brit in the second campaign map.

changing recommendation to NO!!
----------------------------------------------

I own RE1 and played it a good bit. I have tried to go back to RE1 several times but found that game taxing and lacking challenge because of the way the AI manages there stations.

So I am not displeased with my perches of RE2. The current price is a fair and justifiable for the new people entering the game. Also note that this game is being released to the platform gamer as well. Could they of release the PC version at a slight discount maybe $40 in homage to the fan base that got us here?

In short I really enjoy what they have done with the game. It is not a mindless game like people are saying. Look for reviews of 10+ hours. It takes that long just to get through the first campaign. I still have 4 campaign and 14 scenario then sand box to go. I will get my $50 out of the game and recommend the game to new and old players.

If you want a hard core game you can schedule all cars manually like some of the competitors. 

The things that make this game fresh coal in my engine are :
-Track laying, primarily the merge and overlap is smooth
-Way points! I just never knew how much these were needed.
-Demolishing and re construction, the computer is able to reassign current train without disabling old trains.
-Removal of the personal is a good thing in my book.
-The AI manages the trains in a competitive fashion. I have not run a sand box yet so I may find different.
-The track direction and signal change is much better (hatter going to hat)
-The warehouse system!! This is BOOM!
-The rest of the stuff that makes this just complex enough without sticking a fork in my eye.

The bad :
No PvP
No variable adjustment for pan and rotate (easy patch if the devs want)
I will find other stuff in time if I want to.

changing recommendation to NO!!

The campaigns and scenarios are ok until they include counter intuitive time sinks. Requirements that you literally have to build track add trains to get the check, then destroy it all because it is counter productive. My last scenario was 3 opponents in Europe. I had them bought up and absorbed/destroyed within 2 hours of game time. The next 8 hours was doing checks so I can unlock the scenario. Then I realize i need 350 active trains? There are only 22 cities on the map and i am already congested at 120 trains. AND mass train management is the pits!

This game has become a test not a strategy. I may log some sandbox time in the future but honestly 

In short the AI is N/A and the upgrades to track building has resulted  to jagged no flowing tracks unless you literally click from point to point and don't consider cost.

Some people may be put off by the fact that much of the flavor and graphics of the game remain unchanged, and this feels more like a major version update rather than a whole new game. Regardless, the improvements to mechanics, track-laying, and tasks make the game much more enjoyable.  

The game may be overpriced at $50, but if you enjoyed the original game or similar railroad tycoon games, you will definitely not be disappointed.

One of my biggest gripes with the original is you would sometimes be assigned random tasks in the free-play version that seemed impossible. So far, after 10 hours, that issue appears to be eliminated, and you are now given challenging but achievable objectives.

The ability to quickly lay parallel tracks and expand on existing ones is SO, SO much better. You can do realistic-looking junctions with multiple tracks in parallel. The AI pathing is smarter about sorting trains entering a station. The addition of station extensions is a huge game-changer allowing goods to flow through cities in a way that seems so much more realistic. My only complaint so far is that only 2 station extensions are allowed per city, which always seems to be maintenance and warehouse. I would like to see cities of a certain size be able to add additional station extensions.

I do miss the distribution warehouse approach from the original game, which could still be helpful in this game. This would act similarly to a marshaling yard in real life, allowing for more complex routing of goods.

Overall I find this game even more enjoyable than the original, and unless cost is a huge factor for you, I highly recommend this sequel.",1685661611,1685661611,True,1,0,0.520905971527099609,1,True,False,False

If this is your first Railway tycoon game, or you were like me and loved RE1 and just wanted a newer version of the predecessor with better graphics, controls, and map to play with (without investing in DLC), you'll likely enjoy this game!

BUT...
If you are a Die-hard RE1 fan who was hoping this game would be completely different than RE1 or have some groundbreaking new features, you're likely to be disappointed, it's just RE1 but better (albeit more expensive). 

The Full Review:

Personally, I feel like a lot of the negative reviews are quite disingenuous, now if you were expecting Railway Empire 2 to be a vastly different game than RE1 with the same price and no changes to the core railway building, I can understand if you were disappointed. But if this is your first railway empire game, or you were just looking to get RE2 as basically an updated RE1, then there's no reason to dislike the game. 

It more or less is just RE1 but with significantly more polish, optimization, and better graphics. I will agree perhaps the price is a bit high for what it is, but if you enjoyed RE1 and wanted a game that's just RE1 but significantly better, then this is the game for you. Track building is so much better, the maps are much larger, and the trains significantly more choo-choo-ier, the game is gorgeous and I'm having a lot of fun with it, but I'm also slightly biased because I really did just want RE2 to be RE1 but better, which is primarily what this is. 

My only real complaint is the change to the time system. The game plays significantly slower than its predecessor. Now this can be easily resolved by going into the settings and disabling the time syncing with your zoom level, but when you turn that feature off, trains going at 25 MPH look like Japanese bullet trains on Nitrous, and the inverse is it takes a significant amount of game time before you can research later trains. Really more of a nitpick than a major complaint, but just giving us the option to toggle fast forwarding higher than 3x without turning off that setting would be cool, that way we can easily pick what speed the game runs at without having to go into settings every time I want to just relax for a few minutes and watch my choos-choos go woo-woo between the intense economic planning sections. 

Multiplayer is also quite disappointing currently. Although a good idea, I think we're all in agreement we all wanted to be running our own companies while playing with/against our friends' companies, not all managing the same company at the same time. Really hoping this changes sometime in the future.",1685656244,1685656244,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Original review: 

This is a train-watching game. 

This feels like it should've been released as a QoL update for Railway Empire rather than a ~$50 cash grab ""sequel."" It's literally the same exact assets. The campaign is the exact same format and type of tasks. It's so easy to build now; it's barely even a puzzle game. It's a train-watching game. With the improvements to track mechanism I was able to beat the campaign in a disappointingly short time. 

The worst part is, they may never release anything to make this feel worth the price tag. Everything will be paywalled. Heck, they even paywalled the game guide! I shelled out extra to pre-order the Digital Deluxe version because I spent hundreds of hours happily laying track in RE and I was excited for this game. I am ashamed that I paid to pre-order because this is not the triple-A quality I'd hoped for. 

If anyone ever makes another good railroad game, I hope they spend more time fleshing out the management side of things rather than spending so much attention to the graphics quality when 'riding along' on your trains. I couldn't care less about that. I don't play games to watch movies.

If fixes probably the most frustrating, carpal-tunnel-inducing aspect of the first game with automatic signalling. Even if you knew about the CTRL+Click shortcut for signalling in RE I, it was still a pain, and you still could accidentally end up with stuck trains at some intersections. Here, all that is gone, and managing train routes is also made a lot more logical and easier to manage. Want to add an extra train to an existing route? Just go to the route panel and raise the train count! No more waiting around to space the trains out (game does this automatically), no more tracking down the right train to duplicate, etc. BUT, if you still want to manage the train details, go ahead. The previous detail management panels for number of cars, goods priorities, etc., are still there. On top of that, the track laying system has been MUCH improved as well.
Is it perfect? No, still not. There are at least two subtle but impactful bugs I've encountered so far, one with routing and one with stuck trains. But is it as much if not more fun than the first? Definitely! Is Kalypso going to ship DLCs to extend the current scope of the game, and mooch more money off of it's fans? You betcha!

Not sure how others say this game is the same as the original RE. It is significantly different. Train matenance is different, city buildings are different, warehouses are different. The game is similar to the original. In my opinion, this one is much better.

Really, the only negative thing I have to say is the price is higher than I would have liked. But I have bought other games at this price and I do think it is worth the money.

There are 5 campaigns and 14 Missions.. They included Canada, part of Mexico, The British Isles, and Europe in the base game, along with the USA. These were base game plus several DLCs in the first one. The total of all of those DLCs was more than the $49 they are charging for RE2.

I really like the gameplay and so far I have spent slightly more than 20 hours and I am 1.5/19 missions in. So that would mean I should get at least 250 hours out of the game just finishing each mission once.

At $50/250 hours .. That would be 20 cents per hour of play time. I really do not have a problem with that. I have 850 hours in the original game.. I like this one a bit more.

I highly recommended it.

After playing for 20 more hours I changed my mind and now recommend this game. While removal of some of the finer controls (signals, manual interchanges) initially feels like a wrong design direction, it frees the player to make more complex delivery networks later in the game.

Maybe its me. I grew up in a generation where we were told games had endings and the creators made it so it was almost impossible to see the end. This game doesn't hand you wins for free. You learn and adapt...... and then start over. Simple.

1644320,139335410,76561197979848037,0,1,8549,0,3196,1688838801,"Most of the negative reviews about this product at release seem to be people who have played only a couple hours and are complaining that many of the game mechanics have changed from RE1. ""Why change something that worked?"" Others are saying it's a dumbed down version of RE1 with nicer graphics. To sum up my writings below, RE2 is not RE1. If you want to play RE1, then go play RE1. Why should you expect RE2 to be the same? Complaining that the price tag is too high for a game that's not like RE1 is just dumb. There are so many refreshing changes in the game mechanics that makes RE2 a great stand-alone game that is just as challenging and enjoyable as the original.

Like other game franchises - Civilization for example - the victory conditions remain the same with each new game in the series, but we always see some small and big changes in the mechanics, tech system and concepts from entry to entry. This is exactly what I observe when I compare RE1 and RE2. At first look, the new game seems like it's just an RE1.5, lots of stuff looks the same but with better graphics. Big deal, right? City growth mechanics are almost exactly the same, station and track building is similar and creating new routes is also very similar.

But, with a great stroke of creativity from the developers, this ends the list of apparent ""similarities"". Here are some of the major changes I've taken note of which make this a totally different game:

1) Goods are now shipped ""on demand"". The stockpiling of resources which was a major mechanic of RE1 is now gone. (This seems to be a gripe for some players, but in my own opinion, it's more realistic and makes for a new set of challenges)
2) As a result, route and warehouse management now becomes much more important since goods will not ship from a rural or city station until a city demands it. Traffic jams and poor route management will quickly stop your cities from developing.
3) To help you optimize your network fluidity, track laying has been changed. At first, it may seem like it has been ""dumbed down"" to make track laying easier for new players. In truth, with the addition of gridirons that can be placed at either ends of your station tracks, track laying has become less of a hassle! I can't reclaim those lost hours playing RE1 where I tried to get that track plan just perfect to optimize the flow of goods into one station. Sure, the automatic signal placement is a little clunky and unrefined right now, but I can see some easy fixes in the future to make it better. But I'll jump on the bandwagon of those who want manual signal placement back. I have a feeling that gridirons and track setup is essential to the new route system at the core of the game, so custom signal placement may take some time to implement correctly, if the developers chose to add this feature in an update.
4) With this new route system, trains can now pick any empty track when it arrives at a station that is equipped with gridirons. This doesn't always work great, but I've already found ways to optimize my routes using gridirons instead of the old dedicated track strategies found in RE1.
5) Locomotive maintenance is now mandatory. No more replacing your locomotives every 3 months in lieu of placing maintenance shops at your stations which caused major delays in RE1. Luckily, with the new route system with the gridirons, your incoming trains can be routed to any free platform track while another locomotive is being serviced. Sure, buying more tracks and adjusting your gridiron structure is now costly and somewhat time consuming, but it comes hand-in-hand with the natural growth of your cities and rail network.
6) Station extensions are a changed mechanic in RE2. You are limited to only TWO of these very powerful add-on buildings per station. In the early game, it is highly likely that stations in your major cities have both a maintenance shop and warehouse add-on, using up both precious spots. As you progress and make more money, you will be able to afford to replace one or two of these extensions with some powerful money-making ones.
7) With the removal of the stockpiling warehouse mechanic in this game, we instead have the opportunity to build up to THREE stations in each city with a maximum of 8 platform tracks each. Yes, it is actually a decrease in total available tracks compared with some of the stuff we were able to do with the large stations and large warehouses in RE1, but I'm OK with it. It places a definite limit on what you can do in a city and you can now customize each of the three stations to optimize express or freight traffic with the different station extensions.
8) Route management is great. Instead of having many individual trains with the same locomotive, route and cargo assignments, we now can manage all of these identical trains in a single route. Super easy to adjust cargo assignments, the route, mail and dining cars, etc with a single click.
9) Larger maps. I've only played up to the 3rd campaign level so far, and haven't touched the scenarios yet so I haven't seen the full maps yet. However, it seems like there is a lot more room between cities to fit all the necessary track infrastructure.
10) The pacing of the game progresses slower and there is a strange dynamic speed control over the game depending on how zoomed in or out you are on the map. I've seen complaints about this already especially in the early game where money generation is slow going while you wait for cities to grow. I'm not sure how this can be fixed but I can agree that this is an area which could be cleaned up a little by the developers. On the other hand, it's refreshing to be able to have the time to observe and optimize your network while you are waiting for your cities to grow. I find myself reviewing the next tasks and planning ahead without being under the gun.
11) No more pausing penalties. Yes, I was one of those guys who played RE1 at the hardest difficulty levels but always took the score penalty by enabling the pause function. (This never stopped me from achieving President score anyway). I am aware that the competitive challenge of RE1 was to play without pausing and was a great way to take the game to the next level.
12) Employees are simplified. What a relief! Did anyone else think that managing your train employees in RE1 to be a hassle? Oh, you couldn't pause while doing this either, anxiety central!
13) I would be remiss if I didn't mention the updated graphics! Everything looks great, including the ability to customize your locomotive colors and such. 

There are some aspects to the game that I haven't really utilized yet, like the sabotage mechanics, so I will refrain from discussing them at this time.

Criticisms:
1) Automatic signal placement. I do believe it's 90% there, just needs to be polished. There are times that important signals at junctions aren't generated for some reason. Also, it would not hurt to allow manual signal placement which would negate some of the quirky automatic signal placement issues.
2) Adjusting track direction. Every time a segment is added or adjusted, some segments of track lose their track direction and it needs to be reset. This is not the main issue here, but if you adjust a segment that has an active train on it, the train despawns and is brought back to the origination station. Please fix this! As long as the game is paused, figure out how to keep the train there until I fix the track direction!
3) Gridirons can be better, especially ones with 4 or more tracks. Additional X type crossovers within the existing footprint of the gridiron are possible, opening up more routes for trains when there is one crossing over.",1685561986,1685562461,True,10,0,0.581120967864990234,0,True,False,False

It brings the time period when the western states did not exist and were under the rule of Mexico. So far by 1846 Mexico is a bigger power than the United States! My railway network links from most of California up to Redding; over the Sierras and a non-stop run to the Mississippi along multiple east/west routes!

The other nostalgia is that it takes me back to Railroad Tycoon from the 1990s. That was such an excellent strategy game for its time and this is that and more. And what, with the amazing graphical journey across North America, who could ask for more?

Gameplay: I love that I just ground away at my largest competitor and hostiley took over his entire company and merged it with my own.

I currently have about 24 hours in RE2 and I am really enjoying the game.  It's similar enough to RE1 that there was basically no learning curve, yet different enough to keep it interesting.  I'm not sure if I just used warehouses incorrectly in RE1, but the system here allows for really complex freight lines - They absolutely make my brain hurt when calculating what's going to end up where. 

Overwhelmingly I would recommend this game, especially if you like RE1 or RT2.  It will scratch that itch for sure!  The graphics are also really easy to look at.  

Somethings to be warned about (Things I'd love to see improved). 

When laying parallel tracks, especially around bridges and curves, the game is buggier than RE1.  In RE1, maybe 1 out of a 100 track builds had a little red preventing the building of said track, but in RE2 I would say that happens 1 out of 5 track builds.  It's frustrating to have to go in and tweak what seemingly should be an easy task.  

MP was a complete let down.  Currently you can only play cooperatively, there is no competing against other players.  Once my friend and I decided that, even though it was weird to share the same money and work on the same lines, we'd give it a shot... well, we were disappointed pretty quickly by the lag.  The lag eventually (before the first year is done) is so bad that it becomes unplayable.  

It's annoying that you can only build so many buildings and extensions, but I suppose it just makes the game more challenging.  

Those are really my only complaints thus far.  

Overall, I was looking forward to this game.  The day it came out, I read the ""mixed"" reviews on steam.

Railway Empire 2 is a simulation strategy game that lets you build and manage a railway company in the 19th century. You can choose from four regions: Europe, USA, South America, and Asia, and each one has its own campaign and challenges. You can also play in free mode and create your own scenarios.

The game focuses on trade and economy, as you have to connect cities and industries with your rail network, transport goods and passengers, and compete with rival companies. You also have to research new technologies, upgrade your trains and stations, and deal with events such as strikes, accidents, and natural disasters.

The game also features co-op multiplayer, where you can team up with up to three other players and share the same railway company. You can cooperate or compete with each other, and use diplomacy and sabotage to influence the market.

The game has a large and detailed map that covers the whole world, with realistic terrain and weather effects. The graphics are crisp and colorful, and the soundtrack is fitting for the era. The game also has a lot of historical references and facts that add to the immersion.

Railway Empire 2 is a game for fans of trade and management sims, who enjoy planning and optimizing their strategies. It is not a game for those who prefer fast-paced action or combat. The game can be challenging and complex at times, but also rewarding and fun when you see your railway empire grow.",1685247314,1685469892,True,29,0,0.59992903470993042,0,True,False,False

I'm yet to use a calculator or a spreadsheet, everything is rather straight forward. Your real care is put into track layout, station placement, and other physical considerations for expediency. Easy to play, hard to master.

If you're interested in playing this sort of game for the first time, I'd recommend you buy it. A lot of negative reviews are from people who played the first game, but a lot of the new quality of life features were simply impossible in the first game. Terrain is also a bigger factor now.

I did not play the first game, but I have watched some videos of tips and tricks for the first one. I am very satisfied with the new quality of life features brought in this one. I would probably agree it's more of a Railway Empires 1.5 as opposed to 2, but I do think it is an improvement in a lot of ways. ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it."" They only fixed some of the broken things and modernized the game. It is well optimised and visually pleasing.

I would like to be able to build 4 station buildings, 2 is obnoxiously arbitrary. The AI also needs improvements, it simply doesn't know how to make efficient tracks, it just spams a spider web. I also don't like that I can't enter into a business deal and connect tracks with rivals. I also don't like that players aren't bound by national policies. Why can't British Rail and Rail France make a deal and connect a channel bridge and exchange goods? Why can't two different companies connect coast-to-coast rail in America? The game is relatively simple in those aspects. I'd like more diplomacy and options to build business deals than simply only hostile competition.

At its core, it's a solid and enjoyable game. Easy to play, hard to master. The UI is a bit simple for console users, I'd like more PC flexibility, as well as faster game speeds. Will continue to play and recommend.

EDIT: Oh, there are some small bugs that can happen, but so far I've not experienced any permanent or game breaking ones. Simply, restart the game to ""refresh"" the computations and it will often resolve any bugs you're seeing.

The map is so much bigger now Omg. You still can play on regional maps but the whole US/EU maps are pretty mind blowing. 

Some of the day one reviews are needlessly harsh and these folks have low playtimes, leading me to think (just my 2c) it’s cold feet over the asking price and going in with the mindset you’ll turn it off before the refund window.  You can currently get sometimes soft locked in tutorial that’s true but claims that “it’s just RE1 nothing new” is very much false, it’s very familiar to RE1 players but there’s a lot of new as well, eg. The ability to add hotels at a rural station between 2 cities so passengers and Mail transfer there instead of directly City to city. Warehouses are now an add on to the station so you don’t need entirely separate entities, making it easier to keep the network flowing logically at full scale across dozen so of cities and rural businesses. 

Auto signaling, it has pros and cons. Pros: you never have to fiddle with signals when you merge or split a line anymore. You used to have to clean up these junctions so there were no short or overlapping Stop blocks that allowed trains to lock up the junction waiting for a train to get out of the way. On the other hand, not being able to manually place signals means you cannot place additional stop blocks on straightaways to allow empty trains to bunch together at farms and such. 

On the other hand, you might want to rethink that old approach to farms anyway, as the tutorial spells out, if you have a farm between City A and City B, now instead of needing 3 lines between City-Farm-City, you can just use the 1 line between city-farm-city, using as few as 2 trains, and transport passengers mail and/or freight, including industrial goods, between all 3 using hotels/warehouse attachments at the farm. So in a lot of cases you might no longer want trains loitering at the farm waiting for a full load. What this means, ultimately, is you could build out a regional network without ever making a crossover line or needing to tunnel or bridge over your own lines, because everything can just be transported to the nearest node, whether farm or city or a station placed in the open. Which also means you can operate with fewer net trains overall. That's revolutionary, and eliminates the original's biggest late game headaches, especially as you scale out to hundreds or even a thousand or more trains. 

But saying that, lines are easily laid, gridirons eliminate what was once a sometimes very finicky process of manually placing diamond exchanges (which sometimes could even crash you to desktop in RE1 if you hover over the wrong thing at the wrong time). And trains are much more easily managed by Train LINE not by TRAIN, so if you want eg 4 express trains between 2 cities, just add 4 engines to the line and they will automatically space out themselves, which is very neat because spacing trains in RE1 was a time consuming process that eats up the in game calendar. That also makes changes to the line far faster, if you need to move the express to track 3, all the trains get the same order to move you don’t have to repeat it for every train on the line, as you did before even if a line had a dozen or more trains running it. I won’t miss that!

The graphics and scale refresh are welcome, it’s not a revolution in difference but it’s a breath of fresh air, much more definition to landscaping, but the change from cartoon avatars etc to 3D uncanny-valley avatars is slightly off putting, this ain’t Tom Hanks Polar Express. But you can pan through the train interiors now which is sorta nice, the only thing is your camera is on an invisible rail, I would have preferred it to be more freeform looking around but I could see how as soon as the train takes a turn that would make it so eg. Your camera is clipped out of the dining car from the rotation. The fixed method allows you to see inside more neatly even as the train winds. Not a big hit or miss anyway as 99% of play is not in this mode. 

The last complaint I think is silly is day 1 DLC: it’s not DLC for scenarios or game features etc it’s for ebooks not unlike the Prima game guides that used to be sold for gameboy games etc., you don’t have to buy it, the in game help menu has more than enough documentation to succeed at playing the game with. Those ebooks reportedly have a print version on the way too which sounds like better bang for buck. The guide just helps you cheese scenarios with walkthroughs and such. 

Ultimately you cannot go wrong either way, RE2 will give an RE1 player new legs with advantages like 8 lane stations that RE1 doesn’t have (it feels incredibly choking to only have 4 lanes per city once you hit a few hundred network trains, and trying to build Station 2 in a city much later on is nearly impossible in many cases because of industries). Level diamond intersections between different runs of track eg. NS/WE are also possible to build which will lead to new ways to build your network out efficiently. However as warned about in the Help guide, this will only work at an angle, not at square/90-degree crossings. More like a >< than a X. 

if you don’t have that full release/difference in price money to spend don’t panic, RE1 still has bargain value left in it, with a lot of challenging and tuned scenarios to play. RE2 builds on that with more in my opinion. I would still welcome the ability to add a means to have short blocks for empty trains, but other than that choo choo everyone.

[u]PROs:[/u]
If you buy this to play single-player, you'll have plenty of fun. There are a few minor bugs. To be expected 
this early after release.

[u]CONs:[/u]
If you intend to buy this for multi-player, don't. Not yet. The hosting player has all the functionality. Almost none of the most useful information entered by the hosting game is sent to the team-mate game. As a team-mate, not only can you not edit train/route names but you can't see any of the edits by the host. Station names do not always correlate between the two machines. Bug reports sent to the devs. These will surely be fixed in time.
Multi-player team-mate audio cues are either not present or on an inappropriate volume slider.

Rule 1. Never buy version 1 of anything.
Rule 2. Read the reviews before purchase.

Bottom line. Great single-player experience. Lousy multi-player experience.

After reading some reviews, the consensus was that Empire 2 is the one to get if you are new to the Railway Empire world.  I have owned it for three days now and am somewhere around 11 hours in (it’s a holiday weekend ;-) ) .  I am very pleased with the purchase.  It feels very open especially with the sandbox, meaning almost endless ways to play.  Pro's - It holds my attention well, sandbox, multiplayer (haven't tried it yet), strategy is needed.  Cons - Hopefully more content forthcoming, the tutorial is good and fairly encompassing but there are still a couple of things I scratch my head over for a while.  

Overall, my feeling about Railway Empire 2 is very positive.  Pretty sure this won't be my last Kalypso Media purchase.

* ""my trains choose the wrong tracks!""
- You can set waypoints on each line to ensure a train follows a given track

* ""my trains use the wrong station tracks""
- You can edit the line to define which station tracks it uses

* ""I can't choose which resource to load""
- Yes you can, edit the line and set priorities for which resource you want to collect

* ""the game says two stations aren't connected""
- You probably didn't place a station grid iron, or set the path directions on the rails correctly.

And many, many more. 

So far I've loved the game; it removes all the excessive tedium with the laying of tracks and signals. And while I can understand the concern of limited control coming from lack of signalling, so far I've had no issues.

In my opinion, the game is well worth it; the maps are huge and the gameplay is fun. I can only feel bad for the developers for receiving so many bad reviews from players simply because the players can't be bothered to learn how to play the game.

Let's say for instance you begin in Geneva--the game is unable to generate random objectives, so you will always have tasks to build two rail lines, paris-orleans and dresden-prague; however, you can't just purchase the region concessions for the areas and then build these two lines, no, they have to be connected directly to your HQ city through one continuous line. Why did the devs do this? To give the game scoring/leaderboards and clearly defined speedrun objectives that remain consistent through each playthrough. If you're someone who wants to just build logistics networks in the way that literally every other game in its genre allows for, this is not for you. It feels like transport fever but missing half the content and there's no mod support.

There are so many other issues with this game, i'll list a couple of the more frustrating ones. The ridealong camera is completely laughable, I don't know how this made it into the game. Good luck learning about parallel tracks and gridirons, the tutorial is bugged. Gridirons must be placed on 0% graded tracks and stations cannot slope, so connecting mountain stations is absolute hell. There are only 13 levels of zoom from a nearly first person view to an almost full map view, there is no option to adjust this or pan speed. If your middle mouse button is broken tough luck, there's no option to rebind its functions. Track construction is janky, it feels like placing roads/paths in workers&resources in the sense that you constantly are blocked by proximity warnings. Building junctions looks ugly and asymmetrical out of necessity. The game automating signals is nice, but it also causes some issues and makes it impossible to fine-tune your junctions to know for sure they will work. From a game focused entirely on railways i expected more, it even manages to fail the people who just want to get zooted and watch little trains move around a map.

I enjoyed Railway Empire one well enough, though the comics-style of the characters was a little off-putting (is this a strategy or a comedy?) and eventually, like many others, had my fill of the cumbersome problems with train routing and rail directing - it just was not fun once you grew to a certain point. But there was definitely promise!

This sequel, as other reviewers have said, is more like a Railway Empire 1.5. The routing is slightly improved and they ditched some functionality like hiring individuals (and personalities) and assigning them. 

Your inability to add ""Extensions"" (aka Station expansions) beyond two is just bewildering. The requirement of a separate maintenance shed that is not on the station property and for it to need to be boosted to 90% to actually make it useful is just horrible game design. Why build something that's only half effective by design? It should default to 90% or higher, and allow you to reduce the effectiveness to save money. Railroad Tycoon II, release in 1993, handles this better - and it's 30 years old.

The graphics are an improvement, I appreciate them, but this is railroading...we don't need detailed sophistication there. 

What we need is deep strategic thought and gameplay - something that is sadly absent here. This game needs more quality thought on gameplay put into it - better stocks markets, better interoperability in the ""extensions"" - and less concern with the visuals. It's a sad, underdeveloped title. I pre-purchased and followed this - even asked questions during the live-demos to the devs.

Pros:

Graphics - The game is gorgeous. I find myself happily riding along a lot more with my new rail line to test it out that I did previously in RE1. I do, however, find myself missing the simple cartoon characters as the new animated 3D ones are a massive eyesore in my eyes and look pretty rough compared to the simple cartoon ones of RE1, an unnecessary addition.

Stations - Up to 8 tracks that expand as you go. The gridirons can be a little finicky but so long as you keep them under 4 lines they seem to work smoother than signalled stations in RE1. The addition of station buildings to negate the need of separate warehouses and add another challenge to most efficiently setting up your lines is a huge plus for me.

Contour building mode - Although we had contours in RE1 the contour screen mod is so much easier and clearer to build with. 

Manage trains as lines - Instead of individually making and remaking lines for every individual locomotive you now manage a route as a line and select how many trains you'd like to use that line. They even go as far spacing themselves out along the route, which can be an issue if they're idling in a busy station but I think it's a nice touch. No more snakes clogging up behind each other. Plus one change made to the line effects all the trains. 

Staffing - This bring me onto staffing which thankfully has been simplified. You now just control the general staffing for the whole company from one menu. Whilst I did kind of enjoy the mini-game of assigning people who got along to trains to improve output it got very tedious very quickly, big plus doing it this way.

Cons:

Signals -  I was the type of RE1 player that liked to place all my signals manually and often set up trains loading/unloading manually too. So I do understand the frustration with the new auto signalling in RE2. It's very convenient and for the most part works seamlessly and makes the game a lot more accessible to the average gamer. However I'd like the option to go back to manual signalling also, like in RE1 as there's certain situations this calls for. (I know everyone just wants engine queues back!) P.S. we have tunnel signals now!

Game speed - I do enjoy the zoom function controlling game speed, to em it just makes sense. You want the game running realistic and slow when you're up close watching your trains but to speed up when you're up high watching the situation from afar. Essentially it's just automated what I did before. However, again would be nice to have the option. I know you can turn this off but it defaults to the faster setting which looks crazy up close. I used to play RE1 on 50% game speed for this reason which unfortunately is not an option currently with RE2. Slow down my trains please!

Bugs - As with any new release these days there are a few bugs, like getting soft-locked in the tutorial because you closed a menu at the wrong time, or the refrigerator car just appearing as a 1st era passenger wagon (anyone else go that one?). 

However they proved with RE1 that they're attentive at patching and updating the game. (There was a time in RE1 before we even had diamond crossings or signalled stations!) So I'm confident we'll get these minor bugs fixed and manual signals back soon.

All in, I can see why people think of RE2 as a re-skin, there's not any new trains from RE1 as far as I can see and the mechanics have been simplified somewhat. However the on the whole the game is better than RE1 in almost every other aspect. Managing routes is so much easier and can achieve much better efficiency than before, it's stunning to look at and I find myself just having more genuinely fun playtime than in RE1. I would like to see some more manual controlling back for the hardcore enthusiasts in the future and I'm keen for DLCs.

The wharehouses being able to be placed within every station really changes how freight exchanges and create so many more strategies for management.  Passengers changing at stations does the same thing.  Staff management is totally different and makes a lot more sense then the micromanagement of RE1.

1.	Smoother Graphics and indeed better graphics.
2.	Signals are more convenient. Some people have said not a flexible, but on balance I think easier.
3.	The City growth is more realistic for me and seems to be more logical.
Negative points.
1.	Audio needs sorting out.
2.	Jumping between Towns / Cities is not as easy than in RE1.
3.	Game speed adjustment needs some more flexibility. It does suit me most of the time, but I can see why people complain.
4.	Drive along mode needs to be refined Keyboard assignments that is.
5.     BUT NEEDS MODS (Steam workshop)

Old Review below
===============================================================
Have seen the Negatives, sorry I disagree. IMO This game has jumped a level. The signalling and track layout was sometimes tricky in RE1. Yes they have simplified it GOOD.

What they have added is a good advance. I.e hotels, restaurants, more stations in cites. And most of the Maps. Europe, US.
Yes it was 50 Quid but lovely graphics and runs great.

IMO good improvement on RE1.

The UI is clean with more information easier to access.  Gone is the train crew micromanagement, it's now a company wide option which you can manage, wages, benefits, training, etc.  Maintenance stations are also gone, maintenance sheds now cover a broad area.  Very helpful to keep random and major breakdowns down around heavy traffic areas.

I'll start with the cons. Firstly, the cost. 72 AUD seems a bit steep, given that it does not add enough onto existing features from the previous game. The fact that there are three Official Guides (in PDF) released as DLC for 8.95 AUD each. Combined with the Original Soundtrack as another DLC for 8.95 AUD this makes the cost quite silly. The soundtrack is nice, but not very long. There's also the game speed. It feels too slow at full speed, and no, this is not a performance issue. The game runs smoothly, but time passes much slower than in RE1. On the upside, there is now less need to pause. Lastly, it's not a big issue, but it would have been nice to include all the Iberian peninsula in the Europe map, rather than just the top third. Beyond that, I can't think of any negative feedback.

Now for the pros. Firstly, the game is far more streamlined from the previous title. Track and station management is much less of a hassle than before. 8-platform stations are fantastic, and the simplified gridiron placement is a hell of a time saver.  The graphics are nice, and the maps feel larger. Hotels for stations at rural businesses (or in the middle of nowhere) is a nice feature.

Trains are much more realistic now vs Railway Empire 1. Now trains accel and decel based on weight and you really need to pay attention to the tractor force of your trains.

This game is the successor to the much loved Railway Empire, and imporves upon many of its aspects.

Pros:
+ Larger stations allow you to it more trains in at the same time. For example, the largest station that you can build are eight tracks where as Railway Empire only had four track stations for the largest. Another QoL improvement is that you can now attach additional buildings to it like a hotel (rural stations), a dispatch office, a restaurant, and a warehouse.

+ You can now add more rails to bridges; the largest that I was able to make was about four rails per bridge which is a great step up from the original Railway Empire.

+ You have access to Europe and Mexico in the base game; these were DLC options in Railway Empire 1.

+ Streamlined railway building that allows you to automatically connect point A to point B, though at great cost. If the stations are lined up correctly, then you are able to automatically make it a double track as well by clicking on the double track icon near the station. Furthermore, the devs have implemented a new building (I forget the name of it) that allows you to build automatic junctions near a larger stations (2+ tracks required). Signals are also improved upon and you can now click on a track, specify the direction and the game will add the signals automatically. 

Cons:
- From what I noticed, it feels like the in game time runs slower than Railway Empire 1.  

- Cities require higher pops now if you want to build useful buildings like a university, library, and museum

- Other users have reported that the game looks worse than Railway Empire 1, but I myself have not noticed. 

- Personnel aspects have been streamlined, and from what I've noticed, you no longer have to assign 
engineers, stokers, conductors, and security to a train; the game does it for you.  

- AI seems dodgy from time to time.

Railway Empire 2 was advertised as an improvement of the first installment and ended up being exactly that:

- The new maps are HUGE: this is the most important change for me as I always found the whole USA map of the first game to be a bit.... miniature? But now the sheer scale of the new map fully immerses you into the whole Manifest Destiny thingy.

- Stations expansion and customization: 8 tracks and ability to set up entries the way you want + adding specialized buildings - these are the things that I severly lacked back in RE2. 

- Graphics got an amazing overhaul: the game looks much better than the first and I'm happy the devs went for realism style. 

- Automated signal palcing is a GODSEND! I simply fail to understand those who're complaining about it: every late game of the first installment always ended up being with a tedious manual placing of each individua signal on the colossal amounts of new lines you could afford. Is that really the ""gameplay"" you guys are missing?! I mean, now you can easily concentrate on the central point of the game: planning and establishing lines without spending a HUGE amount of tiem on the MOST TRIVIAL AND USELESS activity asuch as signal placement. It's not like the first game had semaphore settings that exist in W&R: SR, there was absolutely nothing special about them there!

- The staffing of each individual train seems to be gone and - honestly - good riodance: knowing that you weren't able to get optimal configuration for each engine was more of a frustration. 

TL/DR: if you want to get into the boots of a raliway tycoon and ride through the history of steam locomotives - then just buy this game without any second thought :)",1685132751,1685132751,True,5,0,0.527272701263427734,0,True,False,False

Pro's: 
Stable

Campaigns can be done with Co-op
Track laying planner helps plan across multiple friends
Can monitor and assist each others lines and upgrade them

Con's:
No PvP mode, only PvAi
having more than 1 friend in the lobby is definitely not fun early on
No color designation because youre on the same railroad, so its hard to tell whos trains are what later in game
Your rail road MUST connect, you can't just go off into another state and establish a separate railroad, the lines must connect

Right off the bat, when you first boot up RE2 and either put yourself in a scenario or tutorial, everything should be relatively familiar if you played RE1. They aren't trying to reinvent the wheel here, the UI is familiar and easy to navigate, plus the controls haven't changed as well. This is a great start, I blazed through the tutorials with ease as the game was stayed true to what the first game established UI and game play wise. The tutorials are still recommended as there are additional game play elements added that are worth looking into.

The most notable change is the way signals and directions of travel are handled. In RE1, this was all manual and needed to be configured by you, which isn't a bad thing at all, but could be hard to grasp at first for a newcomer. In RE2, you simply establish a direction of travel on a particular track, and signals are automatically placed to regulate traffic. You still have to use side tracks, parallel tracks, and so on to build an efficient rail network, but this aspect of the game has simplified. This is seen as a bad thing to some people, and the developers have already stated that should there be high enough demand for manual signals to return, they will in a future update. To further add to track laying, you can have much larger stations, with way more track now. In RE1, you were limited to four tracks, now its double that. You can have more than two parallel tracks and the same goes for bridges and tunnels. Additional track laying features include station gridirons and maintenance shacks which both serve to regulate traffic and optimize operations. Rather than manually building crossovers and fighting with the track laying tool as you increase the sizes of your stations and more traffic comes in and out, station gridirons place a signal and crossovers at the entrance/exits of station to automatically control traffic that comes in and out of the station. This is INCREDIBLY helpful once you start running a crap ton of trains out of one central hub. The maintenance shack, which I can't recall the actual term of it, is meant to be placed in high traffic areas to reduce the likelihood of breakdowns and mishaps. It costs a fair bit to run on a regular basis, which is why it should be reserved for very hectic stations that see a lot of trains going in and out. Along with those two, you have the standard supply depot that refills your's locomotive's sand, water, and fuel.

Another feature that has been added that I greatly appreciate, is the ability for passengers, mail, and goods of any kind to swap trains at a station and be put onto another train bound for another station. Allow me to explain better as technically this was possible in the first game, albeit much less fluent and more tedious. Let's say you have two towns a fair distance apart, and a lumber depot in the middle between them. Rather than have a train that delivers lumber to the main station, and then takes passengers to the far town, then repeats the process, or building a dedicated rail line to that far town. You can now build either a hotel or warehouse at the lumber depot's station, drop whatever goods/passengers off at that depot which will stay at the hotel or warehouse, then take a second train that runs from the lumber depot to the far town and back, and use that to get for example, passengers that want to go to the far town, to said far town without relying on one train to do all the work, or building another dedicated route. I can't understate how helpful this is with how larger the maps are in RE2, which already includes all of the U.S and Europe.

There is lots more I still have yet to see, but little features added that I enjoy are engine painting and fully detailed interiors of the rolling stock and locomotives, and the substantial increase in graphical fidelity over the first game. This game is definitely pretty to look at.

Overall, this is a worthy sequel, and those are just the few things I've pointed out in this review. The negative reviews have yet to truly give a valid complaint in my opinion, and this game is easily an improvement over the already great RE1. Its price is a little steep, but this is for sure a strong contender in the world of modern railroad/transport tycoon games. Simply put, if you loved RE1, you're going to adore the streamlining, optimizations, and improvements made in this sequel.",1685113060,1685113060,True,38,0,0.719069778919219971,3,True,False,False

If you own RE1 stick to that, somehow Kalypso made this game EVEN worse than that one, wich is already a bad enough train management sim but bearable.

What makes this game trash you may ask... fair queston, here we go:
-Track laying is a bug ridden mess
-Building switches from 2 parallel into 1 single  track layouts is also bugged and the automatic signal placement doesn't care about those layouts, therefore rendering them worthless, iit's like the game FORCES you to play with ALL parallel 2 lane tracks or more, that's.... just flat out garbage, few cargo lines worldwide even to our current era run on parallel tracks, would be a waste of resources.
-The ""automatic station signaling thing"" is....... just..... bafflng how counterintuitive it's to place the game NEVER tells you that you NEED 0% grade tracks or it won't work.... good one Kalypso
-The ""train ride"" cam.... how..... just HOW is it MORE limited that RE1 and also with the worst angles posible, is this a joke or somethng ?
-The sound...... oh boy.... hope you enjoy hearing someone with a frying pan going all in frying food next to your ear.

-The only good thing this game has going on is that the graphics are really nice and runs quite good even if you don't have a ""top of the line NASA PC""

It plays differently enough from RE1 that I'm sure I'll get hundreds of hours out of this game, and for anyone who hasn't already played RE1, it's a no-brainer if you enjoy Railroad Tycoon games. I've not yet finished the first campaign mission, but I've already noticed several significant differences. 1) Spamming more trains is no longer the answer to everything. Personnel costs are far more significant now than they were before. 2) It's not as easy to make money on a one-way freight route. Growing cities is definitely worth it, so you can run express trains for mega $$$, but you'll need to find a way to pay for those freight routes in a way you didn't have to before. I love the addition that you can build hotels at rural industries to turn them into passenger routes. That's a great way to keep your freight trains active when they have nothing else better to do.

The graphics are much better, so anyone who wants to ride onboard their trains will find much to like here. I've seen a few graphical glitches where long grass grew through the tracks, but the devs will probably sort that out in time. Otherwise, it's RE1 but with improvements, and I have to say I like these improvements to warehousing, signalling, and the ability to use rural freight stations as passenger hotels. Is it worth $70? That's for you to decide. If you're new to RE, I'd say it's worth it. If you're an RE1 veteran, it's probably tougher to justify this purchase. There's some stuff that's different but not a whole lot. It still has a lot in common with RE1. If that bothers you, perhaps you shouldn't buy.

Other aspects I liked seeing get more noticed would be industries, building placement, city designs, employee as well as company management along with the return of A.I characters with nice backstories and the introduction of multiplayer co-op which I believe will need discord servers, in my opinion, in order to actually use so if you got a discord regarding that do share as I want to try that feature out when I do get the chance. Though despite all the good things the game does have going for it I do want to note that the game currently has a small selection of trains, I was hoping for something like the library of trains we got from the First Railway Empire such as each nations obscure trains for instance Austrailia as well as Japan, but I believe we'll see those trains in later updates so we just got to believe in the following:

-I hope that the game will expand its library of trains as well as work on future DLCs that will greatly improve it.
-Add a competitor mode which would greatly be fascinating for any railroad simulation as I've desired to see that.
-Other improvements and updates that meet the hopes and dreams of fellow Railroad Empire fans

Over Railway Empire 1 you are basically paying for nicer graphics and better quality of life and some new features. Overall the game looks better and feels like less of a hassle to play. 

The automatic track laying feels much better and the generated earthworks are much more complex and beautiful than before, being able to build large raised stone walls instead of bridges and tunnels to save money. Merging tracks is also easier and more intuitive and 4 way cross intersections are now possible with 2 sets of parallel lines.

Setting up signals is automatic (which people seem to hate but for me I like it) and you can set up multiple trains per line and add/reduce them seamlessly and the game gives you more information to help you decide how many trains you might need on a line over time without spelling it out for you either. 

Stations have up to 8 tracks now. You can still set up dedicated lines per track or use gridiron switches with all or some tracks which are now included in game as an option. 

Personnel has also been streamlined, for example no more managing the stoker for each individual line, you have stokers for every line that are automatically hired (or quit if you have bad work conditions).

Also warehouses have been implemented in a different way, now not acting as permanent storage but letting goods switch lines within a station to get to an eventual destination allowing you to make use of rural stations as a means for freight to line hop among other things. I think this is genius compared to before, as now when a train is leaving a city it can calculate if a city's goods are needed basically anywhere in your network if you build warehouses in the right places. 

Hotels have been added as a counterpoint to warehouses, they are also built at stations and allow passengers to get from city to city using their own logic  using hotels to get off and wait for the next train on their chosen journey. With this, there is now a demand for routes between any city and any other city on your network. For example there are separate passengers wanting to go between New York and Baltimore, and also others between New York and Washington. How you get them there is up to you whether directly or using hotels.

Cities look different depending on region, and overall things look less cartoony and more polished.

There are other changes but that's what stood out most in the time I have played.

I understand basically what amounts to quality of life and graphics aren't worth the price tag but for me it has been so far. 

also yes for what it's worth making you pay for a game manual as a DLC is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen but I am reviewing the game not that DLC lol see my reviews there for those views",1685047764,1685051468,True,291,3,0.936943709850311279,2,True,False,False

The automatic signaling is definitely a welcomed change. I do not miss putting down signals a bit, and I sincerely do not understand why so many people seem so disturbed by this change. As far as I see it, auto signaling does not reduce the difficulty of optimization of routes. If you really want to challenge yourself, you can still start with single-tracking with waiting segments to expand connection faster. However, after trying this briefly and spent more time (and in some cases, more money) upgrading to paralleled tracks, I decided to go with double tracks all the way from the beginning to save my sanity.
Graphically, RE 2 also improves a lot. The map is much larger, making the scale more convincing. In comparison, in RE1 my rail connection often grew larger than a city, breaking the sense of reality.
The performance can be improved though. My Arc A750 is barely hitting 50 fps with 2k, but this sure can wait for future optimization.

The enhancements made to the track building alone are streets above the previous game, though it does still take a good bit of adjustment to remember to set the track direction.  The ability to drop switching sections without having to build them on your own, as well as updates to the method in which connections can be started, round out the magnificent upgrades.

New pieces are present to play with, such as maintanence stations that can reduce those annoying breakdowns from time to time.  There are also station upgrades to bolster the passenger lines, mail, and create a warehouse without having to actually create a warehouse.

A part of me does miss the cartoonish characters from the first game.  The tonal change of Railway Empire 2 being a bit more serious and grown up was only a slight disappointment as you quickly grow accustomed to it.  The biggest positive from this side of the game is the ability to adjust the frequency of the banter from the NPC's.  This dramatically cuts down on the number of times you have Beatrix von Pomp barking in your ear about building a station next to hers.

The new soundtrack is very forgettable; the old soundtrack echoed the works of Ennio Morricone
The overall visual color pallet is cold, uninviting, and thrown together; the old color pallet was full of warm earthy tones and lacquered wood finishes.
I found many aspects of the game that seemed hurried (such as the UI, character and world assets, and cinematics) and others that seemed overly fixated (such as level detail). While playing, I zoomed in very close at one point and discovered a surprising amount of detail in the foliage which tragically seems like much misplaced effort for detail that is unseen in many other parts of the game.
I caught myself wanting to close the game and open up the original several times in my short play session before I resolved I should get my refund.

My verdict: Not enough compelling improvements from the original installment. Graphics, UI, and soundtrack are lackluster compared to the original installment.

Game to me, is the best train sim right now. I play a lot of train sims, always thought RE (original) was good but not great. RE2, however, seems to take things to a new level. 

Not only are the little things thought of (being able to see flow of transport of goods from all over the area quickly, ease of using signals/switches, zooming all the way out shows a great overview of your layout and trains with a lot of info/icons and also speeds the game up, etc.), but an extra layer of complexity exists in RE2 that didn't in RE, which I enjoy. In short, you have more things to do, especially re: optimization, but the way you do it with the features make it easier. That is, you focus more on the management aspect of it instead of the ""How do I technically do that? Which buttons do I use?"" It's much more intuitive.

Also, the graphics are a huge update. I didn't think that would be a big deal to me at first as I don't need great graphics in a train sim. But they stand out here, very well.

As mentioned, there is much that is dumbed down from the previous title.  I would argue most of the purchases of this new title will be players familiar with the franchise (such as it is).  The tutorials that I completed were EXTREMELY BASIC, but they offered more detail than the original game.  Also, there are some hidden gems of updates and upgrades to the gameplay, but if I had not plaid the EXTREMELY BASIC tutorial, I would not have known.

Refund - on hold for now.  Although the number of reviews only lend to the dissatisfaction I have purchasing the deluxe version.  

What is different - graphics are better (marginally), camera interaction is different but a bit wonky, and there some minor considerations of the gameplay that are improvements both within the mechanics and the UI.  The topography of the map is also different - some of it seems exaggerated to real life, but also more varied than the first game.

My biggest issue is with the marketing of this title.  I have been watching for the release, and knew the price would be - well, I wasn't surprised with the price.  2 different versions were offered, with the deluxe being very hard to decipher as to the difference and added value.  I pre-purchased to save a few $, and find that additional DLCs were also release after the fact.  One of the perks of the deluxe was the soundtrack.  Ok - fine - I like music.  When I go to download that particular perk, I was taken outside of STEAM to download from Kalypso's portal using a code and only had 60 mins to do it.

This little journey with the actual software, and how they have released ""extra's"" after getting buyers to bite on the pre-purchase really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Understand the mentality of ""if you build it, they will come"" buying approach, but this has the feeling of bait and switch.
