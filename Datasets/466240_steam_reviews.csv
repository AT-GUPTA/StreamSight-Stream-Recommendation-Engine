What sucks due to the terrible community is that if you want to get cool items, like say with the 5 year anniversary items, in time- you really have to have every one of your friends frequently available and that can be hard to do as an adult with adulting to do.

Innocent:
You pull a lever and either stand in an objective ring or shoot/knife targets for items.
There was also the double objective, a test of trust depending on the item ( shotgun, lethal or inspection kit)
Then when the lights went out hell breaks loose and half the time yer panicking to get the fuses in before you get killed.
Then once all fuses are in you have to run like mad to the next area and the game flowed wonderfully from area to area.
When you voted you shot/stabbed people, very satisfying when you are absolutely sure the person you downed is a Terror.

Infected:
Drink three bars of blood (3 double bags or 6 half bags) to unlock Terror Form
Each Terror type has specialties. Experiment (temporary body double), Yeti (temporary damage immunity), Werewolf (Howl disorientation) and Vampire (bat getaway).
You could play the short game if your partner was good enough and end everyone in the first round, or the long game and try to buddy with the innocents and make it a 2v2 and then end the game at the last area of a map. But then they can still get away too.

Deceit was a pulse pounding HORROR game that was all about lying. It was fluid and beautifully gory. 

Not to mention that the perk tree was fun because you could literally choose a different build as you gained perk points. And it reset every season making it all the more fun.

You never knew for sure who was gonna win and it was FUN.

THE LORE
The big part of the game for me was the lore, the gamemaster takes these six people and drops them in these maps and has them play HIS game. He taunts you throughout the game, his voice filling the halls with various phrases. And yeah occasionally you wanna scream at him because it's his fault. 

Part of the fun was always being able to talk, the darkness of the maps, the fact that you don't know if you are innocent or infected until you are in the ""game"" and go running around.

The Devs trashed all of it...

Innocents have to traverse three zones and escape through the safety hatch as the infected tries to kill them before they reach the end.
It was originally sold for 14,99€ and became free to play as the playerbase was really low.
Deceit has not a really huge playerbase nowadays but it is more or less stable (around 1000 as peak a day).
Voice chat is very important in this game, you need to convince people that you are innocent. Playing without a microphone puts you at a huge disadvantage, also you should be able to lie if you are the infected.
Deceit is unique and different from most games, it provides fun for a good amount of hours and it is also a good free alternative to Dead by Daylight.

Currently at the time of writing this the game is an Early Access game so I can't really complain about the queue times or the couple bugs I have encountered. Also the Developers are super active and release updates weekly and they're in the discord so if you have any questions they will respond within 24hrs. Super excited to see how the game evolves over the coming months with plans for a new map, weapons and more.

I should say that i bought the game when it was 20 euro (now it's free) and i have more than 200 hours on this game. I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone, it really pisses you off. There are like 10000 bugs, and it's really annoying.

- RANDOM CRASHES in the game (internet connection but my internet is working)
- I kill someone and after 2 seconds i get downed by the guy that i already killed (ping but something)
- I select ARCTIC TERROR but i'm still other terror
- If i randomly press jump MANY MANY TIMES i can get up on the walls
- I can pass trough windows if you, again, press jump randomly many times
- You can go in exit when the door is opening (not opened yet)
- Sometimes when you give a survivor the antidot he is still downed
- Many times i get downed but i can still kill others for 10 seconds (until i die) but i am downed... wtf..
- Double jump bug... many people can DOUBLE JUMP idk why 
- You can give lethal injection DOUBLE TIMES
- If i am arctic form and they give me camera i can't eat them.... but i'm immune.... wtff
- On THE FOREST map i can jump in the trees... seriously?
- Sometimes i hit 1 bullet with the shotgun and i give 100 hp, and sometimes i give 0 hp but i still hit them
- HitBox really retarded to be honest

So, after MANY MANY videos on my youtube channel (http://youtube.com/zzandrei) i can say that this game is not worthy :)

► It's fun to play as both Innocent and Infected. 
► You can apply different abilities to different characters (adds more mystery to the game). 
► Most cosmetics are unlockable without having to pay for microtransactions. 
► LAN games for when you have enough other people in the house who want to play the game and want to avoid the cancerous community. 
► You can get tokens to unlock new outfits for your characters. 


CONS: 

► Graphics settings are pure garbage and always stay the same regardless if you set them to low (which barely even reduces the texture quality).
► Partying lobbies will ruin your experience as they will usually just kill you off even if you ARE innocent. 
► Queuing takes a while sometimes. 
► You still get players from other parts of the world who don't speak your language playing in the same game. 
► Some players will just loudly spam gibberish into their microphone during the character selection screen. 
► You can't adjust the volume of other players' mics. 
► The Werewolf and Vampire packs make the game Pay-to-Win at this point. 


MY OTHER OPINIONS: 

I heavily dislike the fact that players can party up as it just incentivizes cheating and foul play (like killing off players who aren't in their party). The game is fun if you have a group of chill friends to play this with. I heavily encourage playing with a friend or two because the game can be really depressing when you solo queue. 

Due to the small community, you usually end up facing some of the same people over and over again. I faced the same people [b]5 times in a row[/b] in Ranked. Typically, you'll usually get paired up with extremely competitive die-hard players who are just extremely toxic, have no fun, and/or cheat. Most of the streamers who play this game are just as vulgar and irritating to [i]play[/i] with, not just [i]watch[/i]. 

[strike]Now, this game is constantly changing, which may seem great or terrible for others, so I didn't bother listing this as a pro or con for these reasons.[/strike] The developers have practically ceased all substantial updates to the game apart from a few blue moon updates that usually add or remove a seasonal event. The game is still extremely buggy with hit registration and blinding Terrors. I remember having to use the flash on a Terror 4 TIMES before I downed it. 

EDIT (January 23, 2020): I'm changing my review because the game has not gotten a well needed overhaul in years. Bugs from previous years still exist, Discord groups are constantly destroying the game, and reports don't seem to do anything. I was just in two matches where I was infected, and my teammate decided to just betray me so he could play with his Discord buddy. Ranked matchmaking is so bad that I kept getting paired up with the same people [b]5 matches in a row[/b].

In all honesty, the game was completely barebones at launch and still seems like a low effort project that uses the same recycled models and animations. No significant changes have been made to the game in terms of matchmaking and the community is even more toxic thanks to the devs making the game free-to-play.",1515117468,1579812589,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember when the game first came out, I probably got it like 2-3 weeks after launch?

It was really fun! Played it with friends I met on DBD, and irl. game was intense, fun, scary, and even had it's hilarious moments.

I've recently started to play it again for some nostalgia, unfortunately, All those old friends had moved on from me and I was left alone to play it.

I didn't notice too many changes, perhaps I had forgotten some things but there were little changes I took note of.

My heart sank however, I had saw someone out of the map, I had asked if it was a glitch but they responded by calling me a racial slur, I promptly quit to stay away from the negativity.

The next game i joined had some nice people in it, I might a nice person named Liz and we went off on a killing spree together with some lethal injection, had some laughs. Was a fun match. The game wasn't an UN-ENJOYABLE experience, still fun.

As far as I can tell, some issues with updates and glitches/mods/hacks are prompted for me to give this a bad review.

Maybe they will update it in the future? That will change my rating probably.

Would love to see more work put into it, you guys did great with a concept, and if you're having trouble with ideas or just don't have the will to continue, do the adult thing and sell off you're game, I'm sure another company would like to continue it's work. I'm proud of you for a fantastic game. I'll be remembering you.

Much love

[b]THE ONLY ONE AND MAIN REASON IS THE CURRENT MM[/b]

Matchmaking is dead. For some reason devs decided to create ranked and casual mods instead of merging them into one. Thus, everyone is playing casual and you get ppl who are lvl 1-2 and lvl 30-90 in one match. Do I need to say how pointless it is to play a match like this?

I really like that they have in-game rewards. If you play a lot you will get some swag e.g. custom avatars, limited cosmetics etc. For example, the xmas event was amazing!!! A lot of good players were playing 24/7. And players could get a lot of swag. However, now it's gone and lobbies are dead.

I will come back and play constantly if they manage to create a balanced matchmaking. I really want to play in my skill group and not with players who just installed the game. That's mental!!!

This game is awesome, you have to rely on your instincts, read other people in the sense of trying to figure out if they are lying or telling the truth, and watching out for the horrendous monsters that are in the game lying to you and trying to kill you! This game has a few maps and a selection of characters that you can customize and portray in game while you are on a task to either escape if you are a innocent human, or betray lie and decieve if you are a infected monster trying to kill everyone before they escape.

I absolutely love the aspect of this game, I thoroughly enjoy lying to other players in attempt to get the innocents to kill other innocents being an infected, as well as sneaking around watching and relying on my own logic and intincts to make sure I transform unseen if I am infected, or watch to see the infected taking bloodbags as well as listening to and paying attention to other players demeanor to decide whether they are innocent and infected. 

There are also an abundance of gadgets in the game to help you determine whether other players are innocent or infected, as well as improved weapons, traps, lethal injections which are my favorite when relying on gut reactions, and plenty of other helpful tools in the game to help lead you to victory.

After playing the game for many long hours I'd really like to say something before it's Free to play and a lot of people surely'll come.About how I fell about the everything.
And yeah, I'm a school pupil and am experienceing the 3 years of senior high--just began and won't end soon so may be not able to play it only except vacations. So left the letters as I'm able to.
I've concerned about reviewing the game for a long time and finally made the decision to do it now(maybe because my poor Eng). Have much to say.
[The players' manners really effect the gameplay so make sure you're calm when making decisions.]
I followed it since it's released and then have the game of my own on 16th June, the end of the senior high school entrance examination and was a Noobly at once. Not long after that, I found it a pleasure and fun to ""deceit"" in a game that's so exciting even though bad skills' the only thing I had. Deceit's not about losing friend, it's about make you and your friend working and thinking togeher, knowing more about'em and having fun. There're many English speakers and Chinese Sprakers(even some Russian guys and the ones from Korea, Japan) I've met and make friend with. These hours're a lot of work.
From official banning players for no real-existing reason, 5th July's big update, devide servers into Europe,american and Asia then every language to the community update ""'Friday the 13th of Oct' it'll be free to play"" now, it did lost many players. School was open and it became a"" ghosty server"" at once and now hopes come. Sad for leaving in school terms.
Well just experienced the servers like before, and for once I just clinked the Casual button, the game started at one moment.(Of course the version's change puzzled me for a while) It's a pleasure to see all of these. But time changed, the ones new here need sometime to learn the skills. They just cannot find the entrance of the next zone and die Cuz of the gas...... Found myself alone in the 3rd zone's a strange thing.

HOWEVER, this game going F2P has saved it from it's impending doom.  Instead of a peak of 20 players, it's now seeing peaks over 5000.  It was on the verge of death, which is pretty sad seeing as this game is really fun.


If you enjoy horror / competitive games, you will probably enjoy this.  You are one of 5 players, of which you do not know anybody's roles.  Is anyone to be trusted?  2 of those players will be infected  Depending on your role your goal is to either snuff them out, or kill all the innocents before they notice your thirst for blood.

This game relies HEAVILY on voice chat.  There is a text chat option, but it's not optimal when you need to let people know things quickly.  You need to let people know what you see happening if you're an innocent, or deceive them if you are infected.  Without voice chat, it makes the game really hard.  Why are you shooting down that person?  Did you see someone drink blood?  Your team has to communicate in order for people to get out alive.  It's honestly boring and annoying if people in the lobby don't communicate.  Eventually, everyone is just dead because the infected picked them off and nobody let anyone know.

This game is great if you have friends to play with as well.  There is a LAN option, so you can play it locally or online.  Deceiving your friends is more fun than deceiving randoms.  Plus, everyone talks if you're playing with friends.

For free, why not pick up this game?  Try it out, see if you like it.  If you don't, nothing lost but a few minutes of your time.  I don't think you'll be disappointed though.",1510297184,1510297184,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

We get groups together and play every night. No two games are exactly the same. Lies are told, half truths are offered, death is dished out.

This game is a riot. I really wish the devs would set this up as a free to play weekend or something to get this game out to the general public more. The game is clean and solid and looks great! Total scare-fest when you play in the dark with the lights off! 

6 people go in, how many will come out? 2 people are infected with a disease that when they drink 6 units of blood located around the map area they can transform into a flesh deamon. These deamons can see in the dark and find the hiding people who would have been your friends had they been infected too. Instead, they're LUNCH! The other 4 must escape in a 3 stage maze of fuses and power loss. Go from one area to the next each phase offers a day phase where the infected people cannot transform. Once the lights go out, if they have enough blood power they can transform and kill one person. When the lights come back on, they transform back to normal and everyone can move up to the next stage. On the third stage, when the lights go out, you can open the escape hatch and then blood or not, the infected can transform on you and hunt you down until you escape or die.

How do you know who is infected? Simple, look for someone drinking blood. Wait... did he just drink blood? Can you convince your 4 other friends who aren't infected that he did and needs to be killed? Devices like scanners can tell you who is infected, but no one else can see what you see. You could be lying, you could be setting someone up because YOU are infected. Trackers will help you find people and watch when they transform, but maybe they don't transform. Instead they convince your friends that you must die...

The game possibilities are endless and entirely up to you how you. 

Cons: 
You will have a difficult time finding games until more people get the game. 
You will ruin friendships over this game... just remember its a game. Grab a drink with your buddies and laugh at their expense later.
A mic is VERY helpful which causes some people to get killed when they don't because they have to stop and type. If you have a mic, you'll find the game is a lot more fun.

Pros:
Awesome graphics
intense gameplay
social aspect
unique game concept

a quick update, even with video evidence, the devs refuse to ban cheaters. i've also been threatened with a ban for showing their name in the videos i showed them. i can no longer ever recommend this game. they've been shown videos and pictures with people running around with their names as obscenities and refuse to punish them when they cheat and scream about it over mic chat. the twtich streamers who cheat are hwo they're mainly protecting because if they make it so they can't or punish them, they won't play anymore and less people will buy this broken game. in it's current state, it cannot be played for more than a minute usually due to cheaters. the reqard system is also broken so you may never get good rewards. this game is worthless and according to the devs i've spoken with, they will not be fixing it ever.

final edit: due to repeated harassment by dev who have gotten one of my social media accounts deleted, they have proven they will never fix the problems in this game and will silence and harass anyone they can. they've deleted and banned dozens of people from the forums for calling them out and giving them the proof they asked for and used the proof to ban anyone who showed it. do not support these toxic devs or their broken product. also, getting loot is broken, you can never get good loot because the minigame is broken. the end round stuff is too so you may also never get perks.",1499368042,1501346720,False,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

Deceit is a game about 6 survivors who wake up. Two of them have contracted a disease that makes them thirsty for blood. The two infected have to work together to kill the other four innocent players. They can achieve this by drinking blood bags to fill their ""blood meter"". Once their blood meter is full, they can transform into a ""terror"" - a terrifying monster that can kill survivors in one hit if they don't have armor. 

Every minute or so, a blackout will happen, when the infected can transform into their terrifying forms, and the most dreaded phase for the innocents. They can either survive for about a minute before the power comes back online anyway, or find 2-3 fuses to set the timer to ten seconds. 

Deceit is a game about deceiving others if you are the infected, and knowing whether or not you can trust your ""teammates"" around you. In this game, you cannot trust anyone.

Sometimes the matches can become repetitive, though. But I guess that would apply to basically every single game with a multiplier mode. 

Overall, great game, and would recommend it to everyone! :)",1500744698,1500744698,True,6,0,0.529927730560302734,0,True,False,False

Its fun with friends specially when they are new and you can just slaughter them
you can sometimes meet really cool people

requires teamwork
Cons: 
Dev team is small 
They barelly do anything to fix bugs
They do not reimburst you if you lose your items due to THEIR updates
if you are a girl [like me] or a squeaker you will be targeted
the lower lvl you the more likely you will be killed for no reason

the infected/innocent ratio is way off 9/10 times im infected

Who survives? 
This is a unique game that forces you to communicate and lie to each other.
it's difficult to get the grasp of, but it's fun when you do!
You will take a few hours learning all of the aspects.
The game experience is interesting. Each play through is different.
The few set backs I have with it.

1. Getting paired with non- english speakers. Since this game is all about communication it simply ruins the playability.

2. Full blood for one kill. (the original version you could be transformed the whole night with 2 blood packs. Now you need 3, and once you kill one person it starts to drain. Which I understand why they implemented this, but hindering the demons so harshly makes it super difficult for them to be able to kill off the survivors. One survivor goes down, he gets antidoted back up. Well since we're on floor 2, we've had 1-3 scanners which means high probability the infected has been found. It's too many odds against the infected. It makes it super hard

3. The community can be pricks. Sometimes friends will down you or just execute you simply because you're not in their ""group"" they did limit the party sizes to prevent this from happening, but it's  still difficult to handle.

Overall it's a great game, especially for the price tag. The devs have an active discord channel and they seem interested in making this game great and keeping it that way. I would invest the money into it for sure. Not to mention i've met a ton of cool friends from this game.",1499216150,1499216150,True,10,0,0.607981860637664795,0,True,False,False

There are many reasons but I want to make it brief and to the point: Its Devs are working so hard on this game, you will receive frequent updates which are mostly 2GB size or even bigger. Though the optimization is always its weakest point, try to be nice to it, it is already much better than how it was when it has just been released.

I've already purchased this game for 4 of my friends, and will probably continue to buy it for people.

General thoughts - Shooting seems ""off"" to me.  Having played a ton of shooters in the past, I don't feel like the gun play is on the level of a Battlegrounds, a CS:GO, or even an H1Z1.  This recent patch seems to have tightened this up a bit though.  Also the new knife mechanics feel familiar and strong in game.

Pros - Matchmaking attempts to put you with similarly ranked players, but I feel like we don't have a large enough player base yet.  I'm hoping we can change that!  If you can get by the learning curve, this game has everything you could possibly want in a survival horror / whodunit.  The game shines even brighter with a group of friends.    Please feel free to contact me if you’d like to discuss the game in depth.  I’m a huge evangelist of this game, so reach out to me!

Cons - To me, the main downside right now is playing with people that haven't given the game enough of a chance.  This is reflected in a lot of the negative reviews.  If you check them, they’re typically from people with less than 50 hours played.  Everyone that has played 50+ hours has been through getting stomped by higher level ELO players, getting a partner as the infected that doesn’t know quite what to do yet, etc.  If you can get through that and embrace the game for what it is, you'll have a great time.

I have played this game for another 5 hours and I've decided to change my review to recommended (even though the problems I mentioned in the review still exist). All the game breaking bugs have workarounds, and I'll admit I'm having a blast playing this game. 

Thanks to the devs for replying to my review, I can see you guys are working hard on the game and hopefully all the current problems will get fixed soon.

As for the report system, I highly suggest you guys also implement put a report button at the end of the game, which is the norm in most competitive multiplayer games, I'll admit I didn't even notice it in my first 4 hours of gameplay. 

I honestly believe you should release a solo queue mode for a competitive. Queuing with friends is fun, but you never know what information they might share with each other, even with a party of 2 people, ""harsh party size restrictions"" sounds shady to me. Right now, you can queue as 3, but even a party of 2 people can share information that can break the game. I'm sure most people who play this game a lot would agree. (to be fair, solo queue could also hypothetically have 2 players or more could queue at the same time and most likely end up in the same game, but still, I still feel it'd be better for the game). I've only encountered point farming party twice, so fortunately it's not something that you see often. But hopefully you guys consider doing a solo queue only mode.

Also please fix the map with snowstorms inbetween buildings, there are so many bugs with this map (missing door on the first stage, glitch when opening the exit door, floor with no collision on the 2nd floor) it's driving me nuts.

-----------------------------------------

Well apparently I can't refund this game after 3.9 hours.

Let me start off by saying that this game is fun, I've had fun for the first 1-2 hours, but then problems starting popping up, and fairly serious problems for a game that is NOT in early access, so I unfortunately can't recommend this game. 

***If you are the developer or a player considering buying this game, I highly suggest you read my bad section before you do.***

Good
------------
-Super fun werewolf kind of game, definitely a blast when playing with friends, or the right group of strangers
-Items found around the map are fun
-Character traits are pretty cool, the leveling curve seems just about right
-The 3 room mechanic flow feels very good, not too rushed, but not too easy either
-Meet people from all around the world (I had a girl from Korea, a girl from Denmark, a Russian guy, a Chinese guy, me (Canadian)

Bad
------------
-No solo queue/no report system

Meeting the right group of strangers is fun, but meet a 3-man premade that is farming points and it gets REALLY bad really quick. If you aren't aware, a game has 6 players, 4 innocents and 2 terrors, terrors must kill the innocents and innocents must escape the map/find the terrors and vote them out. To my knowledge you used to be able to queue as 4 and 5, but obviously this brings a lot of problems where people would just bully/kill the 1-2 pug players.

If I lost you, let me give you an in-game situation that happened to me while playing yesterday.

I was the terror with another guy, he told me he had 2 innocent friends with us in the same game, all I had to do was follow him and do as I was told. they shot one of the innocents (you need 4 votes to vote someone out in the first room) so even though I knew what they were doing, I also wanted to win, so I just voted the innocent guy out, we then voted the other innocent guy out, and then proceeded to farm point for the remaining of the game while the 2 other guys were watching us. At the end of the game they were pretty angry (I was too...), I wanted to report them but there are not report feature implemented. 

Which brings me to my points: 3 man queue is just as bad as 4 and 5 if played right, and unfortunately makes the experience a lot less fun (even if I was on the winning side). You can't expect everyone to behave according to the game rules, which has to be expected when you are designing this kind of asymmetrical game. Solution? I think the best solution should be to have 3 different queues. Let me explain:

Competitive
1- Solo queue, you understand are aware that when you are queueing for solo queue, you will not be in discord with other players, and any unfair/farming behaviour is reportable.
2- Team queue, where teams of 2 can queue together, and are matched with other teams of 2, any unfair/farming behaviour is reportable

Public
3- Team queue, any number of players (1-2-3-4-5-6) can join, and no behaviour is enforced, you always risk running into people who will sandbag you/kill you, but at least you can still queue up with your friends if you want too. Although for obvious reasons you can't be allowed in the competitive mode.

I'm not sure if there is a big enough player pool to implement these queues, but the following solution fixes all bad reviews this game currently has (people complaining about premades, people complaining about not being able to queue with friends). For this to work as I mentioned, we need a report function and have the community/ops guy review the reports. 

-Stability (crashes, freezes, lagouts)

I can't really provide any suggestions for this one, but I've had a lot of them in 4 hours of gameplay, way too many for a game that isn't in early access. To give you an idea, I've lagged out 5 times (the whole lobby lagged out, not just me, I didn't notice if my rank went down as I was just trying to have fun), crashed twice, and froze 3 times at random locations.

-Bugs

I'm pretty sure there are more, but I've come accross 2 game breaking bugs that can be extremely frustrating
1. There is an exit door on one of the maps, once your open the door, you get thrown out of the map,you can't do anything and must wait for the game to finish on its own (you still lose)
2. There is a floor on the second floor on one of the maps that has no collision, if you walk on it, you fall off the map, with the same consequences as bug #1.

Conclusion
------------
If you are a group of 6 players thinking about getting this game, do it, you'll have a blast! Otherwise, I think I would wait and see if these problems gets fixed. 

Vote for developers: I will change my rating to positive if a competitive/solo queue mode and a report function gets implemented, I don't mind dealing with lagouts/crashes/freezes from time to time, but if I can't even have a fair gaming environment when the game actually works, I'd rather not recommend this game to potential customers.",1494789971,1494984694,True,0,0,0.439560443162918091,1,True,False,False

I do not recommend this game to anyone.  The game is the most buggy game I have ever played.  In just the past 15 minutes I have crashed 3 times, all during a game.  There is no way to avoid it, it just happens randomly and there is nothing you can do about it.  The developers have released an early access game disguised as a full release.

Fun game if anyone remembers the mod on StarCraft 2 for ""The thing"" or AKA: ""Parasite"". Reminded me a lot of that. Love the deception thats involved. It's like a game of poker, try to find out whos lying, and whos not. Which I love. But the biggest flaw, is that the chinese players are killing the game. How? They make up for a large portion of the players at nighttimes (beyond 10pm cst) - Which means: They are unable to communicate with us except themselves, they typically rat/cheese/kill with no reason/ whatever word you choose to use that describes better than what I came up with. I would take a no-mic USA person over that, because at least *I* can talk to them. 

In the end: if we had seperate servers / seperate matchmaking - I would reccommend. But since they are with us in our games and they are killing the game when matched with them, I can't reccommend this game. The line of communication in this game is more important than anything. Plus, the communication, the talking, is part of the deception aspects of deceiving others. So again, matched with chinese, it kills the game.

Edit: We have more localized matchmaking. Meaning that the game tries to pair us with local members first of your language. Before it searches to other languages/countries. My biggest complaint was this and it has been fixed therefore I change my reccomendation to Yes. Althought it has it flaws, it still is a fun game. If you like deception games it's really fun, although random killing can be a match-killer. As of 5/7/2017 I have changed this.",1489398827,1494192028,True,0,0,0.500806152820587158,0,True,False,False

2). Needs more content. Specifically more maps. And could do with more weapons. But the weapon aspect is currently debatable. As it stands presently, the weapon system is balanced and getting an edge needs some team work which I approve of. 

3). Once the game acquires a large player base, it should offer language-based server settings.

You will lie and decieve your teammates into thinking you are not infected when you are, or maybe you aren't and they aren't believing you so you have to make some shit up to make them spare your life.  

If you're infected:
You will need to beable to lie well
You will need to be patient
You will need to be sneaky in grabbing blood bags and executing teammates without being caught.

If you're innocent:
You will need to be able to convincingly tell the truth you aren't infected if somebody is lying.
Be a teamplayer
Dont be annoying on the mic(that gets you killed pretty quick)

You will need a mic.
You will need to watch the tutorials, only 5 minutes.  
You will need thick skin.

I can't possibly in good faith recommend the game as it currently is. 

[i]tldr; Latest update has fixed nothing, brought new bugs such as the crate name being messy '@UI_CRATE #11', and even brought back old bugs like gas zones both being deadly which now happens more often. At least they aligned the pistol sights to the centre of the screen and made it accurate when aiming down sights though! Right guys?

Money grab by devs, soon to implement paid for skins by the looks of things (items still have [PRICE HERE] embedded into them...), and the game is buggy as hell and only gets worse, and has a toxic community.[/i]

[h1]STAY AWAY! Buy on sale perhaps for $4.99.[/h1]

Pros:

- Amazing gameplay in a vacuum.
- When you do eventually get a good game, the gameplay is engaging and fun.
- Character select screen is the lobby from the original Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombie map ;)
- Can level up your character and earn perks.
- Can unlock costumes for your characters

Cons:

- Buggy AF.
- Toxic community
- Only two maps which get tired real fast
- Developers keep adding in mostly skins vs 5-10% legitimate bug fixes (of which there are many) which often end up creating new peculiar bugs anyway. Remember this is not an EA game, this isn't good enough.
- Mouse will be rendered useless one in every 3 games upon joining the game (latest 1GB update did this for me)
- In order to make the game playable and not run at 20 fps I have to go into settings and select 'Low' which increases frames. But doing this in the main menu DOESN'T STICK. You have to do it for every game you get into!
- Half games will start with my mouse curser activated in game... One game I was blessed to have the middle click scroll button as my cursor.
- Game crashes for me once every 8-10 games or so.
- Often matched with Asians who cannot speak english. Not their fault, but why match Australians, Americans, and other English speaking people with Chinese servers in a game where voice communication is vital?
- This is more a discontent with human psychology than the game, but people are incredibly stupid in this game and because of this you'll find you only really get a decent game one every 3 or 4 games, not including game crashes, because other innocents will vote you out immediately in the first round because you ""were standing next to empty blood bag therefore infected"". Lumped in with this are people who play in small groups of 3+ and just randomly eliminate people together within the first round. Alot of people do play together/you can tell they are queued with each other but actually play the game properly, props. Anyway, I guess the votekick happy meta will evolve once people learn the game more.
- The ADS crosshair is 2 cm below the centre of the screen, and accuracy is congruent with this. You're better off aiming from hip with guns.

All of this aside, if there were global servers and you played with a group of 6 friends (without any collusion), this would be an amazing game. Can't recommend for $15 at present build.

I cannot express the amount of fun I've had within my first hours of this game.

The gameplay is fluent, in combination with probably some of the best online social experiences I've had, wraps up to be one of the best investments of 15 USD in a while. 

The balance of the game is on a whole other level. The element of surprise is what will lead to your victory-- whether it be attacking early and efficiently, to following an Infected player and closely surveying them until the final moment. The first-person skill ramp will get you out alive, in key with your past experiences and gamesense. Your teammates are threats as well, though mellow ones. Acusations and will fly like fresh hotcakes on a griddle if something isn't right. While you cannot harm the Infected while transformed, if their barrage of their own body is not effective, they will most likely die immediately after.

I see almost everything within this game having some sort of counter-play. Unless an unlucky game is given and three people have cameras, you can easily target and destroy the one, or even two people with them. All items in this game are useful!!

Pros:
Good Gameplay
Great Mechanics
Multiple Maps (2 as of yet)
Multiple Objectives
Team up with up to 5 others

Cons:
Main Screen can get a bit buggy (in terms of formating)
Can Crash 
Slightly hard to aim gun

**SYNOPSIS** The Game Master has kidnapped six players and locked them away in a remote location. Two out of the six players are infected and must kill the innocent players before they escape. The innocent players must escape the Game Masters arena while simultaneously trying to figure who the two infected players are.

This type of game is a classic ""who is my enemy and who is my friend"" because you truly cannot trust anyone in this game no matter what they say or do.

**CONS**
- Game sometimes lags in certain areas of the maps
- As of now, 3/21/2017, there are only two maps and they get boring pretty fast
- Cameras are WAY too powerful against the infected when they are in Terror Form
- Asian players invade the NA servers so you may get into a game where no one speaks your language
- Some players go on shooting sprees to simply rank up their perks and it ruins the depth of the game
- Cosmetics. I added this because having very specific cosmetics that you unlock can ruin the fun for this type of game. The idea that everyone looks the same makes it difficult to differentiate between two characters which is fun. People can now just say, ""OH IT'S THE GUY WITHOUT THE SHIRT AND THE GREEN ST. PATTY'S DAY HAT."" and he becomes a SUPER easy target to find.
- YOU NEED A MICROPHONE TO PLAY EFFECTIVELY
- Alot of people play with their friends and only chat in discord or Teamspeak ruining the immersion.

**PROS**
- Every round feels ""new"" because of the new group of players you are playing with
- Dev's have been releasing updates pretty often to fix bugs amongst other things
- Decent price for a decent game

unfortunatly the bad optimiztion is hurting this game badly, it runs very badly in game when it is in fact running at all.

more often than not it crashes, no word of a lie here for every 1 hour on this game i can expect at least 5 crashes,and not just a crash back to desktop! it will simply just freeze my pc over and over again.

You'll hate yourself.
After you deduce who the infected is, how do you convince your teammates? 
Time is running out, time is a perpetual figment of our imaginations, therefor we are going insane working against something that doesn't exist. 

This game is Trouble in Terrorist Town spliced with Dead by Daylight in a nutshell. As the game implies, you must overcome trust issues. 
As the innocent, you move quickly and get geared up for the inevitable while keeping an eye on suspicious players. 
As the infected, deception is your best friend. If you confuse a group of innocents long enough, you'll buy yourself enough time to keep them divided before you go in for the kill. 

Is it worth it? ABSOLUTELY. It's a game that thrives on community. It's well balanced, its addicting, and every game presents a new challenge and dynamic based on the players around you.

Ok so firstly, this game is F*CKING AWESOME. Not only that it can be kinda scary on the asylum map, but you also have to pay attention to other players and plan your moves carefully. This game is all about trust and atention. If you are an infected, you have to build up trust by helping other players and trying to get them one by one. If that is not your approach tho, then you can use brutal strenght and go ham on the 4 survivors if you are next to the other infected. However, if you are an innocent guy, then you have many ways of playing this game. You can always be the guy who is alone, trying to get all the objective for himself and not trust anyone. You can be the guy that helps everyone and tries to stay together all the time, or you can be the douche who uses the lethal on a guy before finishing the round :^). There are just so many ways to play this game, every game brings something new, you are NEVER gonna do the same things over and over again, the objectives are different, the maps are different (even tho there are only 2 maps so far) and most of the time the players aren't gonna be the same!
Now I'm just gonna give you some pros and cons if you dont want to read this whole thing:

PROS:
-Customizable characters, each of them having their own perks and costumes.
-Lot's of items (objectives)
-Good shooting system
-Well designed maps
-Searching for players takes like 5 seconds
-Good ranking system
-Nice graphics
-Voice chat
-And many more!

CONS:
-Lot's of crashes, like seriously, lots!
-This game is not very optimised, i have GTX 970 and i7 4790 and i still have lag in some parts of the maps.
-Only 1 gamemode so far
-You can not use in-game currency yet
-Cameras are too OP against monsters, if you have a camera and you know how to use it, the monster will never get you
-More crashing
-Random visual bugs

So, in conclusion, I can definetly that this game is worth a buy, however if you hate bugs, crashes and poor performance from time to time, wait a couple of weeks until they release a new patch!",1489937349,1489937349,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A little heads up, but if you like getting called names while you're the infected for no reason then this game is for you. lol It's unique, but my only issue with it is when you're the infected you don't really have too much of an advantage. Reason being is because people are able to spam the camera flash on you and even more so while they're piled up in a group.

Ok whole game comes down to one pre4mise, whoever has a microphone and screams its someone else is well on the way for winning. I havent got a mic and cant type when i am being chased or attacked my terror.

Motion blur on trhis game is awful and with dark blackouts it is nearly impossible.

You start at level 20 and the more games you win it goes down.....i am still at 20 as it went to 19 and i lost a game and went back to 20.....oh great! So dont trust the lower level players.

I have died of oxygen depletion more times than anything else. 

Matchmaking non existant i have played 4 games back to back and got the exact same people 4 times. Matchmaking non existant.

I get the games called deciet but it isnt even deciet its a game for grievers. Shooting your own team mates basically.

It has also crashed on a few occasions between black out and lights on game lags to hell.

Now, with everything on low, my computer runs at about 5-15 FPS.

You will have little goodies and tools to help you kill or find out the truth about a person. Scanners that will tell you if a player is infected, poison that will insta kill the monster, cameras that will flash light to stun the monsters, etc.

The game is fun. Not too scary unless you're truly alone in a dark hallway and you hear the transformation of one of the humans into a monster. But if you are alone like that, you deserve to die.

I am often partied up with people that do not speak my language, and this is a game that is based very heavily on communication and deception. You cannot do that with people that don't speak your language.

It seems they've added in a quickchat wheel, which is great, but not enough. I want to play games with other English-speakers. Every game I've had with English-speakers has been wonderful.

The other major downfall of this game is the fact that although it is released, it is riddled with numerous bugs. The game silently crashes at times, and at other times not-so-silently. You crash mid-game and you lose pips/rank as a result.

The only time I have found this game truly enjoyable is with friends, so it has that. Playing with friends makes the bugs bearable.

I have decided to officially put this game ""on the shelf"" and leave it and to stop livestreaming gameplay of it. I will return as soon as this game is either in a polished state that doesn't crash, or if friends convince me.

With that being said the game is fun but still needs work.. But I will support with the fun momments I did have in this game.







EDIT: After watching some gameplay and playing my self my biggest complaint is ""Time""

I feel like this game should last a little longer on each stage giving the infected enough time to get the blood packs and also ""act"" as a fake survivor and communitcate with the rest of the survivors making the game a really big confusion on who is who and what is what.

I feel as its more of a hassle to try to get the bloodpacks when its much easier to gun someone down. I feel like ammo should also be less and the team should work more together through communitcation when there is not much supply left and making the game punishing for survivors. 

Games good but as I said some tweaks can make this game really a matter of life and death.",1488660123,1489008615,True,72,120,0.585241079330444336,7,True,False,False

Is there lag? Yes. But the developers have brought something new to the table where you are up against 5 other human players who you have to decide are worth trusting, or killing. The only problem is killing the wrong player can put the survivors at a real disadvantage. So you have to listen to the lies, use the devices in the game to help determine who the baddies really are and kill them before it's to late.

Major Cons
*Seriusly bad Gpu optimization wich probably is the root of the rest of the major cons.
*midgame crashing issues.
*must you play in lower settings becuase of above ?? game will turn them worst ones back to default Veryhigh after each game! 

Minor Cons
*just 2 maps
*Few Special items


Review: 
After 20h's+ it feels repetitive and there is the risk of people falling out the game becuase of it.
so hurry and throw out more maps and perhaps variety of stuff, handcuffs rope Magnesium lighthed grenades, a random generator on those lootspots. Right now everything is to perdictable for me atleast.

pros:
Cool concept

Cons:
1. Boring as hell.  If both infected die or leave near the start of the game it's literally just 5 minutes of running to the exit.

2. TERRIBLE trait system.  First you have to level up to obtain the ABILITY to get the trait.  Then you have to complete a ridiculous challenge to actually unlock the trait.  WTF DESIGN CHOICE IS THIS!

3. Ridiculously overpowered traits.  Again this goes back to traits being absolute garbage.  One character for example has a trait that gives him 10 more camera uses per camera.  His third level trait gives him a camera.  A camera can be used approximately 6 times normally so he instantly has 16 off the bat.  God forbid he picks up a second camera he has 30 uses.  The camera stuns the monster preventing him from moving.  You can literally stun lock the infected forever with 2 cameras and this trait.  WTF?!

4. You can't kill the infected when they're transformed.  Another shitty design flaw.  Your bullets won't kill the monster they'll only stun him.  Meaning you have to shot, run away, shoot run away, and hope you can stun him long enough until the power comes back on and he transforms.  Run out of ammo? well that monster is going to catch you and one hit kill you.  Guns can only be used to kill people in human form.  Who is designing this game?

5.  Are you infected?  Want to drink that blood bag? Don't have the trait? Well then they're going to hear it from literally the other side of the map.  Who cares if no one sees you.  They're going to hear it and you're fucked.

6.  Terrible matchmaking.  This is the SAME issue that Dead By Daylight has.  New player, level 1 (or in this game rank 20 because it counts down for god knows what reason) with 0 traits WILL be matched up with people who are top ranked and have all the traits.  As the infected he stands no chance.  As a survivor he's basically just along for the ride and won't do much.  Unfun terrible design choice.  How hard is it to put a proper matchmaking system in.

7. BUGS! OH BOY THE BUGS! It would at least be one thing if this game was in early access.  However it's not.  this is a FULL RELEASE!  Did they even playtest this before putting it on steam. Some of the bugs I encounted within less than 2 hours of playing:

 RIGHT off the back I had issues with this game not hiding my mouse cursor.  I had to relaunch the game 6 times to finally get it to hide the windows cursor.

If you're infected and want to use the in game text chat to speak to the other infected you you'll actually be speaking in all chat.  That's right, even though when you push the chat button it reads ""infected chat"" you're not actually in infected chat you're in all chat.  To get to infected chat you have to hit the tab button before you're actually in infected chat.  HOW DOES THIS SLIP THROUGH PLAYTESTING?!

Infected can sometimes become unkillable in human form.  My buddy was infected, he transformed back into a human, was shot into a downed state but instead of going down he froze in place, we shot to vote to eliminate him, but the shots didn't register.  He respawned, we tried again, the shots stopped registering.  So now we've got infected who just can't die at all.

8. EXTREMELY repetitive gameplay.  There's only two levels and besides the environment they're EXACTLY the same.  There's no different items between levels, there's nothing that changes.  It's just a different look and it doesn't effect how you play the game.   Might as well just changed the paint on the wall of the first level and called it a second level.  The gameplay gets repetitive and stale extremely quickly.

9. Getting blood for blood bags is pretty much useless.  Why? Well blood gives you power but there's only 3 floors and on floor three during the blackout the infected get full power and retains full power after exections.  Meaning the strategy is to actually help the party until floor 3, your team offs an innocent by mistake, and then use the full power you get to transform, camp the escape lever, and kill everyone.  There's no deception besides not getting caught until then.  No trying to turn the party on each other, no trying to get people to kill innocents, it's literally help quietly until the end, camp the lever that opens the escape door, and kill them as they come because you're unkillable when you're transformed.  Why bother getting blood and transforming on floor 1 or 2 for some kills when you risk getting caught?  There's no benefit to it.  Another terrible design flaw.

10. Short levels.  Again with levels only being 3 floors you only have three blackouts to kill everyone.  Why are the levels so short?  With the level length you've got about a minute and 30 of blackouts and another minute and 30 of time to do objectives.  Meaning the longest the game is ever going to be is about 3 minutes.  For a game about lying and deceit that's an aweful short game.

11.  15 dollars for this?! This is a 5 dollar game AT MOST and that's if 90% of these issues didn't exist. 

I played this for 8 minutes shy of the two hour mark on stream and requested a refund. AVOID THIS GAME.",1488940989,1488940989,False,46,4,0.512442588806152344,7,True,False,False

- Decent balance of power between infected and innocent

Cons:

- Nothing is really explained, so you kinda just have to figure things out over the course of a few games

EDIT: I have yet to have a game crash (out of 88min straight of play), but it is definitely performing worse than I would expect on this machine.

Pros:
Get to play mind games with other players
Game seems decently balanced
Short games easy to pick up
No extensive loading/splash on startup
characters can each be leveled up to unlock unique traits including traits for their terror form
The game feels incomplete...in a good way
Offers LAN or Online play


Cons:
2 levels currently
Rules are deceptive, it seems only 2 people can actually win
Some items are not self-explanatory
The game feels incomplete..(It's day one, but the game feels unoptimized and a bit laggy)

Totally worth buying, It's a cheap game that is easy to pickup and you could fit a few games in an hour lunch. It feels like if this game were finished it would easily be in the $20-$30 range if not a little more. I personally find it to be a blend of Town of Salem and an FPS.

You'll need to reach the next area once the lights come back on as the area you were previously in is getting gased for something, so you'll suffocate otherwise.

Got 2 dud lobbies that we had to back out of and regroup just to get in the game. Then we got thrown in the game, no explanation as to how to play, and I died within seconds. Tried it again, survived but found out there was a time limit so we lost. 3rd time was the charm, oh wait, my game crashed then several other players had their games crashed aaaaand we were forced to restart our computers. 

At this point in time, I have no desire to play this game again. With a huge lack in players, the wait time for a lobby is ridiculous and requires the use of their discord just to find others. Their servers need some work as we encountered dead lobbies and a few crashes. I play a lot of games like this and have waited out the bugs but this game just wasn't worth it for me. 

I wish that in the future, more people play it and the devs are able to fix the game and add a tutorial.

Starting a game with 5 other players as an Innocent is very fun. Waking up from the floor in a panicked state, you glance around and hear voices of others. You see a gun laying on the floor in front of you, pick it up, and cock it as you begin to stand and see clearly.

While holding Q, you see items you can obtain by standing near them to cap. By watching others' actions and listening to their statements, you try to figure out which two of the six person group are infected. Every so often, the lights go out and the system requires thirty seconds to reboot. During this time, the two infected players may transform into creatures that will kill you. Player names are displayed only when the lights are on. When the lights are out, everyone's name disappears and you see nothing but people customized at loadout. The creatures are free to transform and attack at will. When the lights come back on, they are forced back in to human form.

You can shoot, knife, and down everyone including players that are not infected. Both Innocents and Infected may be downed, however, each player respawns in ten seconds. The only way to kill anyone in the game is through syringes located on objectives you need to cap. You work your way to the third floor of the house where there is an exit you can use to escape the game.

Now imagine the exact same beginning, but this time your screen says you're infected as you get off the floor. As you find the others, you notice your Infected brethren. You two are tasked with deceiving the other players, hindering their progression to the exit, and ultimately killing them.

Such a bad ass game even in Early Access. My only complaint are lack of players and the game lengths as every game has a timer of four minutes and thirty seconds. The price is inexpensive so get it, and join the deceitful community.

Deceit is in early access, and I have encountered two dropped games in the 6 hours or so I have played. I have gotten stuck in the wall once after being revived.... that being said it runs extremely smoothly. The players contstantly fighting (or teaming up) for the few items per level, plus the lights going out every minute or so really amp up the feeling of panic as you try to work together to escape the asylum.

I think my favorite part of the game at the moment is actually being one of the infected. While the lights are on, I can race around for the same objectives as everyone else, and I know I have one loyal team mate.

I will reccomend this as alot of people will leave negative reviews due to the current problems with matchmaking - and likely forget to update them when it is fixed - which could lead to a difficult start for this game.

Despite it's rocky launch, Deceit is a very fun game to play. I have managed to play 3 games in the past hour and a half, and I enjoyed every one.

PROS:
-Great level and Monster design.
-Brilliant atmosphere.
-Creates tension between players right from the start, which continues to build throughout the game.
-Players are able to change their display name, which allows friends to play without knowing who is really who.

CONS (Launch Build):
-Game did not work for the first few hours.
-Audio design seems to be lacking (not sure if intentional or not).
-Currently only has one map (more are to come).

Despite it's current flaws, I believe that as more features and maps come, this game will become even more enjoyable and  will hopefully flourish in early access.

Because I can tell just by the trailer they made and the fact this is Automaton's first game that this game is going to have heart in it. Not only that, but I have a feeling that they will update this game quite a few times until there are few bugs left in it. I've been excited for this game for at least a week and I'm happy that I do have it. Now all I need is to wait for the 'play' option to start working.",1475901277,1475901277,True,7,0,0.424395203590393066,0,True,False,True
