I have many hours in on this game on Xbox but bought here on Steam because I like the Steam platform better. This game has got so much going for it. Yes the bugs are real, but with every update I see some improvements. There is nothing that bad about this game. No it is not perfect but better than most others including Grand Turismo. I have played that game and it looks nothing like this in graphics and real feel of the force feedback. Grand Turismo sucks at giving a real feel to the wheel and have no menu hardly at all to adjust the feedback wheel settings like Forza. 
1. Game graphics and realism and appearance of this game are great.
2. Car choice is great and plentiful.
3. The force feedback menu has many settings to tune for good wheel feel. 
4.  The menu and UI is very easy to navigate and see and most settings are available in race.
5.  Setting up a car or tuning a car can be done with a app called Forza Tune. ( not so in other titles like GT )
6.  Online League Racing is very fun.
7.  It is great how you can change a Event while in race without leaving the race. *****
8  Can be played on a real PC and not just a console.
9.  The tracks look and feel great and more tracks are coming. 
I have a few more but my point is this game is not crap but does have bugs that should be fixed asap.

I don't hate the car leveling, as a game mechanic, but would rather Forza Motorsport go the route of being a love letter to motorsport. Doesn't really deliver on that for me, but maybe I missed something.

Quality? Inevitably, this is where the Gran Turismo comparisons will emerge. The car models are disappointing, and sure, you won't notice that when you're barreling into a corner, but that does bleed into the rest of the game. Does GT7 get everything right? No, but the quality is much higher from car to track. Unfortunately, this carries over to the handling model to me. The cars themselves feel like they are much more prone to understeer or snap suddenly to oversteer. That's all I'll say, part of the problem is I am racing GT cars on GT, but sports cars on FM atm. I still think the cars are not balanced between the front and rear end, but rather drive on a rail.

Graphics are an issue for me as well. Like the car models, the track environments are often washed out or low quality in texture and optimization. I think the game clearly looks better than FM7, but it is still a disappointment.",1709005611,1709005611,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It markets itself like a sim game and separates itself from the arcad-ey horizon series but it lacks a few key elements present in Gran Turismo and Asetto Corsa.

1. Adjustable TCS
There is Full, Sport, and Off for your traction control. That's it. The other games have adjustable TCS relative to the vehicle.
 
2. A solid campaign. Gran Turismo has spoiled me with menus, the training facility where you learn how to actually drive on numerous track and car scenarios, and so many other features that make Forza Motorsport look like a complete joke. A few careers with sloppy AI in a triple A game? It's a scam. Assetto Corsa has more content than this.

3. General driving physics. Most stock cars are very stiff and eager to oversteer. Assetto Corsa Competizione gives you GT3 cars that are beautifully made and drive very well, and Gran Turismo gives you cars that sometimes understeer pleasantly but are obnoxiously more enjoyable to drive than anything in Forza Motorsport. 

4. The car sounds. Yes there are a lot of cars that sound pretty good but compared to the actual simulated turbo physics in Gran Turismo and the gear whine in Assetto Corsa Competizione once again it is a joke. 

Aside from this the game just feels like it wasn't polished on release. Many people had significant performance issues even with impressive setups and had to mess with settings that made no sense to figure out how to get even to 60 FPS consistently. The game is not streamlined at all.

Compared to other sim games, this is a joke.",1708998709,1708998932,False,2,0,0.52513575553894043,0,True,False,False

My xbox controller constantly and randomly disconnects. Currently have a 2023 Civic Si IRL and the 2018 Civic type R can't handle turns at 60 where as my 23 Si can handle turns like that at 80MPH-130MPH. Torque feel is like somehow too much while also not giving any meaningful feedback. The racing wheel thing is what kills me, its like you have to use a racing wheel for it to drive ok but can't because it only supports specific super expensive race wheels. Because you know $70 on a game that has hardly any content isn't enough. Bought a Logitech G920 which is on the list of wheels that work with the game. The steering wheel is constantly giving driver assists even with everything off. The wheel will lock and start sliding even though I'm totally fine and safe. Wheel feeback is awful and I've been adjusting setting to no avail. The car selection feels very bad too with 38 cars that are between 2020-2023 also most are very generic Forza cars with very few notable awesome cars or unique ones would be a better term. I haven't played a Forza motorsport game since 5 (so 10 years) and I can't see any noticeable differences other than the handling being worse. Another fun addition time penalties for hitting cars or going off track. This in theory is great because thats how it works. However some of the corners get bogged up and you either have to hit someone because they're not going fast enough through the corner or you get perfect line and are able to box someone out, only for the Ai to just hit you off the track slowing you down and giving you and off-track penalty. In full simulation mode the steering wheel auto tries to drive for me when I go to make a turn. Who made simulation mode because if it was actual sim you would get no assists at all.

Here we are 2 months after release and the Miami circuit is unplayable. Lags and artifacts at all times with no chance of completing the race. Handling is still awful and the frame-rate is downright horrible. I requested a refund a few months back and wish they would grant it to me because this game still doesn't work for the $100 I've spent. 95% of my time playing is attempting to get the race-wheel, THEY RECOMMENDED, to work properly which it doesn't. Avoid this game at all costs and make Microsoft understand we won't stand for crap that is way too overpriced.

All they had to Do was make ""Forza: Horizon 6"" pretty much by taking out the arcade feeling
of FH5 and adding in real world race tracks and broaden the pool of cars.
Instead they released this pile, The next game cant come fast enough. 
So we can all forget about this one.

A Limited amount of tracks.

No Track creator.

Same Paint that's been in since FH4. Time to add some new colors or a paint mixer
so players can make their own color's.

Same Rims since FH4.

Tires are close enough to what's been on offer before. It would have bee nice to be able to select what type of gas to fill the tire with as well as the type of tire. It'd be nice to have an equivalent to Toyo proxes or some other out their high performance tire and then fill it with
Nitrogen for a little bit of saved curb weight to set some gnarly times on a Pikes Peak or rally styled courses.

Needs a Bodywork booth feature to chop/crop/drop/flare sections of the vehicle manually.
I don't wan't ""Bolt-on"" designer kits. I wan't to be able to go full RAUH-WELT / RWB in the booth and customize and lay in every possible detail how I'd like.

Lacks the Bugatti Bolide and other high end ""fastest"" production cars. Needs pre-tuned profiles based on controller type. I do not wan't have to dial in a controller and then also dial in the car I am racing.

This game really needed an ""open-world"" for lobbies so you and your friends could meet up cigars & coffee style at a venue with gymkhanna styled obstacles and objectives and head out to the real world race track after you decided on an event.

Initially it would boot up and then allow me to select what race I wanted to do then would crash at the loading screen. After tons of troubleshooting, reinstalling, etc. I gave up.

A couple months went by and a ""huge update that was supposed to fix all the PC issues"" came out so I fired my sim rig back up, updated the game. Same crashing issue. Uninstalled/reinstalled same issue...

Flash forward to today I watched Drive to Survive on Netflix in prep for the Formula 1 season to startup next week and got the itch to race...so I said to myself ""eh it's been a few months maybe a new update came out and it will work"". Nope. I uninstalled/reinstalled and the game won't even open.

I spent $105 bucks on the ultimate edition...requested a refund from steam and hoping they take pity on me. Ya I played it for 8 hours but it was on release weekend and it has not worked since. I also have like 100+ games in my steam library and this is my first refund request so fingers crossed.

Pros:
Is the ANNOYING HELICOPTER there from FM7? He's still here but NOT NEAR AS LOUD. Most of the time I can't even hear him but when I do it is subtle. I don't recall seeing him during practice.
Tire model is absolutely fantastic. All the people saying this game is just another Forza must be using a gamepad because with a wheel in full simulation mode with no assists, the game is terrific and light years ahead of the previous titles.
Suspension geometry in general is vastly improved. Drive the '73 911 in FM7 then drive it in this game and see for yourself.
The previous titles were so arcadey when it came to the race cars and anything super fast that I exclusively drove the production cars under 700hp because the grip was unrealistic and the cars didn't compare anything to a true sim. Comparing this game to my real life '20 Mustang and my buddy's '15 Charger, my hats off to Turn 10 for finally getting it right.
Each tire type really feels different which I love. Comparing stock, street, sport and racing is a highly noticeable change in feel.
Turn 10 has always been really good about sound design and that hasn't changed. The cars appear to all have unique sound effects (EDIT: for the most part...I have found some duplicates) and are very high quality. Changing exhaust or increasing the size of turbos or SCs is highly noticeable.
The previous games were bad about giving you too many free cars and tons of money but then making everything extremely expensive. This game is the opposite with cars being cheap and parts free but money is harder to earn.
Part are a divisive topic: (EDITED) the new car progression system, I personally liked it but they've been changing it around. It still only takes like 3 hours of racing to max level a car which is like 2 races for me, that is nothing.
Career races are another divisive topic. When I am playing singleplayer, I just want a fun race. With this system, I turn some laps to see about how fast I am at that track and then adjust the difficulty as needed to guarantee a close race then adjust where I want to start out in the race and fight for a podium finish. I think it is a terrific system that guarantees a close and fun fight. Multiplayer racing still has qualifying which makes more sense.
Gone is that stupid homologation system from the last game. Now you customize your car as you want and the AI drivers match you by using as many points as you did so it is always a fair race (to within 25 PI). It also means, you can see 10 of the same car in a race and all 10 could be totally different. One might have racing slicks and a wing but another might have a wide body kit and a turbo. Totally random and I love it.
AI: (EDITED) compared to previous titles the AI is a huge improvement. It still sucks overall though compared to better racing sims out there but they plan to improve it. I'll come back and edit again when they do that.

The cons:
Practice sessions exclusively start you on a rolling start.
Career races are WAY TOO SHORT! Sometimes just 2 laps around an average size track.
Free play races can still be created so you can come up with your own custom races that are as long as you want, BUT...they don't have the same modes as the Career races. There is no practice and you can't choose your starting position. It is like the free play mode from FM7 where you either choose to start at a random spot or you all get in order of PI which means you are always in the middle of the pack. They desperately need to make the career style racing available in free play AND they need to add in custom championships.
AI issues: (EDITED) they no longer cheat like in the past games but they are still pretty bad. They either mess up a lot and slam into you from behind or if you get alongside them they get scared and drive off into the grass. Worst of all, they often slam on the brakes in the middle of a turn that doesn't require that much braking, if at all.

Performance gets its own section:
Stability: I never had a crash in a race in 64.7 (EDITED, now well over 400 hours and still no crashes) hours.
Ray tracing: (EDITED) this was buggy on release but works fine now. Game looks great
The V-sync drama - (EDITED) this was fixed, not sure if by Turn 10 or NVidia but I can enable V-sync now. I run the game at max settings on a 1440p ultrawide and it never drops below 60fps. It is well optimized as far as I can tell.

Conclusion:
The game is not perfect but is extremely fun and has loads of potential. Compared to FM7 on launch which was so bugged and had memory leaks so bad that I couldn't even browse the wheel selection, this game is a godsend. Are you looking to replace something as advanced as iRacing? This isn't it. Are you just looking to get your simrig out of the closet and have a blast with some awesome cars?

After +110 hours and several updates, FM is still a broken game. 

Infinite loading screens, penalty system is a joke, no real engine damage, dumb AI (ramming,  braking suddenly), countless bugs and glitches, performance is terrible.

To top it all, after update 3.0 the game refuses to launch. Several Graphic cards were unsopported without notice and they all were above System Requirements at game release. Support Forza is silent or ignores people with problems. I have been able to continue playing because I have another PC with different GPU.

Regarding ""new"" tracks, they are recycling old Forza tracks with old uncorrected bugs.

I found myself sitting on my phone for over 30 minutes rather  than doing the next race in the campaign. I had fun for the firsts 2 championships before it became mind numbing. Nothing was enjoyable on a wheel. I wasn't expecting iracing physics (I would just keep playing iracing). But it's supposed to be a sim-cade and a competitor to Gran Turismo. So I should be able to drive relative to other racing sims, but I can't trail-brake, I can't turn the wheel past 13 degrees of steering angle or I loose all grip. ABS activating (in a straight line) at only 15 percent braking pressure. They said the driving experience was going to be ""fun and rewarding"". It took me 4 hours to get the wheel somewhat decent. There was no enjoyment in driving in this game.

Thanks for reading my rant. I'm just disappointed, I really wanted a ""return to forza"". Maybe a little hit of nostalgia (most I got was in game music), but I got this.

It’s not as bad as what people are saying but it’s not as good feeling from previous games!
It's closer to 60% good and the rest is a no.

Graphics: The graphics are always a step up and visually impressive. Some cars do look better than others, it is strange but the tracks, graphics, atmosphere are all great. 
(Performance and triple monitors I will get into further down.)

Audio: Forza has always a superb audio effect to the game. Car engines, tyre screeching, wind, brakes etc are all great. It’s really good on the audio. 

Controls: So with the controls. The game is massively easier with a controller but it’s less fun. I play with a G920 and it works like a charm (I wish I have the Logitech pro set but yeah) so a wheel, peddles and even a handbrake all work like a charm with a lot of flexibility to change buttons across. 

Game-play and everything else after: So as you might of guessed by the screenshots, it’s a racing game!

It’s more sim than horizon which is more arcade. It’s focused on track racing with simulation aspects. 

Currently in this game each car has car points which you earn from driving. You cannot anymore more just buy upgrades and apply them to make them faster, you HAVE to drive that car to unlock car parts to be able to upgrade that car… this is a change from previous FM games.. I am not a fan.. I prefer to buy upgrades as I want and drive the cars I want with freedom.. this does seem dragged out. 
(I do not like to unlock certain unlocks to be able to race better.. I want to upgrade what I want when I want with my currency, personally this feature does not work so well, also if you buy the same identical car then the upgrades do not transfer and you are forced to do it again making buying the same car pointless)

On the back of this it does feel like a grind to get credits and car points which is sad. We get the live service model but I the old way was better. Pickup, play, customise and go. It just worked. Here it does seem like a way to keep you playing longer and coming back for more. Which for many of us is not good. I’ll play when I want and can. I feel the car points system and unlock per car needs to go and revert back to allowing us the freedom is better. 

Racing with a wheel is harder and with the simulation aspect of the wheel is better. You can easily over steer or under steer due to how the game mechanics work! There is a lot to customise and choose from as always. 

The game has a huge accessibility amount of features for anyone. Literally you can make your car drive itself which is amazing for getting more people in with all sorts of disabilities. 

Credits to buy new cars are easy to get with racing. The practise tracks is annoying and skippable mostly for me which is good because otherwise you are doing 3 practise races before doing the actual race and if you quit or save after you have to redo them. 

This is a game you need to pay attention to the how cars are controlled and handle. Full weight system with fuel taking weight and tracks hot or cold, wet or dry, what tyres etc all matter here. 

Multiplayer is fun! Having some good races online with the new feature rating drivers.. this helps rammers with their own lobbies because no one has time for them. 

The trailer did show drifting but currently does not have any drift cars.. same as drag racing but drag racing tyres. It’s weird so I hope this is updated and added in the future because forza always has lots of content added down the line. 

There are a decent amount of tracks to race on which is good and more in the future. Some favourites are missing but more is incoming like more cars down the line. 

Triple monitor comments: So I have triple 2560x1440 in triple mode is 7680x1440 but this game does have a kinda work around but it’s not right. The other monitors have a zoomed in approach meaning this game does not support triple monitors (there is no VR support like other racing games) there does need to be a triple monitor support update for this game because single screen with FOV just doesn’t deliver the right mark. 

Screenshots of triple screens:

https://ibb.co/Wy5XyX1
https://ibb.co/QJ1qyrC
https://ibb.co/H4vRZSj
https://ibb.co/nCsccRD
https://ibb.co/PWZKcLb - This is the full view where you can see the effect from the main to the sides. 

Performance at 2560x1440 I am getting 70 to 120 FPS maxed out. If I go to the triple screen it’s between 60 and 80 fps which in a racing game is fine.. people forget that you do not need these huge refresh rates when it comes to racing. 60fps is more then enough with racing!

There is no story if anyone is thinking about that. It’s a racing game where you go through a builders cup to get better. That’s it, nothing more to expect but good old enjoyable racing and it is enjoyable. Lots of cars and tracks. 

Some things have been removed like the trucks from FM7.. older cars… some of the good tracks which some are coming back. Drag racing, drifting but coming back presumably. 

They have left out a lot of fun features from the previous Forza Motorsport and also completely not bothered to add others.

Examples: Trucks are gone, the fun challenges like how many over takes can you do, the bowling, online infected, tag etc all gone. These made the previous Forza fun but this one seems HEAVILY focused on just the car and racing, which does let itself down (If Gran Turismo was on PC, I would give it a good go.. Specially the ""How far can you go before running out of fuel)

Things not bothered to add in other games like ""Seat adjustment, camera angles, proper FOV, better triple screen support"" lots of games have these nailed. Heck, even Microsoft Flight Sim has an amazing triple screen setup which is super easy to do.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, it’s not bad but at this time as I write this review. I would buy at a discount. Forza will always have updates down the line making it better and better but we’re not there just yet. 

I will update the review down the line because we are still on early days as I write this review. I have been playing since early access on the game.",1696944600,1708713200,True,5,0,0.557928025722503662,0,True,False,False

So called career mode is just a collection of passenger car themed races and not very interesting at that. No racecars! It's a passenger car track day simulator.

Jumping kerbs with sparks flying from under 90s DTM BMW's, MB's and Alfa Romeo's at Nordschleife? 80s Turbo F1 cars at Monaco? Sauber C11 at Circuit de La Sarthe at night in rain? Bumper to bumper racing at Daytona at 300+kph? Pikes Peak time trial with a VW I.D.R? Ford Sierras RS500 with R32 GTRs at Bathurst? No! You mod a Supra, do five races, and then you do it again, but now with a Miata. That's all there is to ""career"". There's very little regard to past or current motorsport heritage. There's a bit of actual GT racing in Featured Multiplayer though.

Tracks - it does not feature Monza, Bathurst, Interlagos or Monaco, to think of iconic tracks. Glad they added Nordschleife recently. A lot of configurations of US stadium raceways and lesser known tracks.

Driving with a wheel - Force Feedback somehow works against me or it wants to turn without my input. It's also very hard to catch a slip, usually ending in a snap oversteer. Recently tried ACC, thinking it would be more difficult, but managing oversteer felt so natural. Force Feedback was really helping to correct the slip.

Handling - it's fine. Some cars such as Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo are nearly undrivable. It oversteers on liftoff, on braking, on exiting the corner under power. It becomes somewhat manageable with all the aids on. Cannot imagine driving such a car for hours at a time. If there is a widow maker it's this one. Meanwhile Audi R18 handles brilliantly with all the aids turned off. Ginetta being RWD is a bit harder to manage out of a slow corners, but it is very stable at speed.

AI - it's unpredictable. Sometimes it's super agressive and rams you out of the track on first corner, sometimes it gives you a lot of space and slams on brakes. I usually play at 7/8 difficulty and manage to win, but sometimes I barely scrape by with 5/8. The drivers in front of me sometimes drive like 8/8 difficulty opening an impossible gap, while drivers behind me drive like 4/8, me ending up in no man's land with huge gaps behind me and in front.

Graphics - GTX4060 manages 70+ FPS without Ray Tracing, which is broken and adds nothing. Sometimes the game looks amazing, other times it looks unfinished. Wheels look blurry and pixelated at the same time. Brake rotors somehow has a mirror finish and mismatched calipers. Chrome parts look artificial. Manufacturer paint schemes ar innacurate. Reflections on cars look pixelated. In replays I see cars locking both front wheels and turning in - how is that possible? Car details are lacking, especially when compared with ACC. Maybe it's the sheer number of cars that make it impossible to design accurately.

Replays - I usually like watching them, but here they are nor cinematic, nor broadcast quality. Usually broadcasters follow the cars all the way through Eau Rouge (Spa) or in Porsche Curves (De La Sarthe) with a zoom lens, to show the high speed and high G's involved. Here it's just random camera angles from the side with no sense of speed. There are a lot of cool angles to choose from manually though.

Even though it got Nordschleife (great!) recently, the update introduced new bugs. It's a like whack-a-mole, they fix one bug for other to appear. My photo mode is now broken. Saving snaps takes a few minutes at a time.

It's nowhere near the quality of Forza Horizon. Car details, engine sounds, graphics - everything is of lower quality. 

Tried to get a refund (but didn't) after 7 hours of playtime of which 1 hour was riddled with crashes and fiddling with graphics. Basically I paid 50euros to be a beta tester and do other people's job. I sense the team behind this game is not passionate about motorsports and know little about cars. Or there are bigger issues they just can't correct. 

Playing ACC currently, maybe after a year or two Forza will become a solid game.

This game ""sucks"" to a degree that even this is wrong. BMW rear wheel drive cars pull down when accelerating. Copy Paste from other cars. I checked with other simulators, and they are all correct.

 ---------------------------------------------


This quick review comes after the last update 5. I am recently using both iRacing and ACC. In fact the more you play those racing simulators the more clear it comes how near or even everything in FMS is just fake. This software is not only a fake simulator but even the interface is so no sense. I guess this game was tested only on a console with Joystick. FMS is a toy when compared the solid simulators out there.

I guess this game is not worth the space on my drive any more.




The below was my first review and I will not change it for referance. Two days back I bought ACC. The funny part is if I assume FMS was realistic that was until I ran ACC. Changing my review of FMS to not recommended. Just get ACC. FMS seems Forza Horizon on steroids.

---------------------------------

Forza Motorsports  is a 5 stars game as is. Enjoyable and very realistic. My background is flight simulations and from this lens I am doing this evaluation.  Reliability is good and it just works well.

I wish to have more FPS knowing that I have 4090 and i9 18 cores CPU (now I am getting 60 to 75, 4K all ultra). But I do not want that at the cost of realism.",1697262082,1708662514,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Quite a few bugs mostly visual, performance was and isn't great but improving. The latest update has made the game much smoother for me.

Best sense of speed in any racing game so far imo, graphics are great (no idea why people say they're bad) and the choice of cars is vast (I don't have any DLC). Customisation is good; you really feel a car's upgrades after applying them, more so than other motorsport or horizon games.

This one has some tweaks to PC performance, and is supposed to provide better multi-threading and better performance on lower end specs. SWEET! That is exactly what I have with my Ryzen 5 3600 CPU. I do see the FPS getting  into the triple digits but what I am also seeing are a lot more micro stuttering. This update also clamps down on PC players being able to run over 60fps in multi-player. 60 is what you'll get if you run without V Sync. Having a refresh rate of 165, I would get 55fps with V Sync. Hard pass on that one!

This update does fix shifting. The delay is now gone, and transmissions upgrades are now necessary if you want to alter your gearing, not if you want to drive the car. Painting gets better camera and view options through being able to zoom int the car. My setup gets confused behind wanting to use the mouse when I have a controller plugged in. 

Speaking of the mouse, right clicking is now the B or escape button. this would be nice if we could press shift to use the right mouse button to aim the camera, but now that function has been eliminated. I'll make a complaint post on the troubleshooting site soon.

Graphically, not much has changed other than the chugging frames. 

Game play is still the same. Update 6.0 is supposed to bring that fix to the career where we can use credits to buy car points, instead of grinding for parts. Being cheap, I'll continue grinding, but I can see others being willing to pay for car points. How this effects the game will be relieving but minimal.The career structure still needs to be reworked and the FOMO elements needs to disappear. For now the career is still a grind and a changing list of races with one race series opened every week. At the end of the season, or what ever they call it, the events and prize cars go away. 

Multiplayer is still the best aspect of the game. Being that the initial rush of players who tried the game via Game-pass have moved on, the racing has improved somewhat. Just lower voice chat to zero, and you'll be able to enjoy the public hoppers.
The penalty system is still basic and often ding the victim for accidents. There's plenty of instances of this happening on social media. It still needs work.

The FFB once dialed in feels like it's missing something. In other more simulation orientated titles, there's a feeling of having a suspension and tires. You hit a bump and its not some flat thud. There's some reverberation in the tightness of the wheel that really sells the idea that the car is regaining stability. This does not happen in FM23. The cars seem to instantly absorb bumps despite all the bouncing that the in game car is doing. Perhaps Turn 10 need to to look at this?

Still thumbs down. Especially now that the increased frame rates made the game a little more choppy. Hopefully this will be fixed soon or corrected with update 6. Glad to see that the game is still being worked on and supported, but I have the feeling that the developers are dealing with a a bigger mess than they are willing to say.


Oh... The Nordschleife is in this update. It's the FM7 version of the track with 10 times the trees messing up the sight lines around the track. Curbs are sill ginormous, and the track comes across as narrower than the versions found in Racing simulations like Assetto Corsa or AMS2. Hell, even R3E with it's ancient engine has a more believable depiction of the Nordschleife. I can see that the developers at Turn 10 worked hard on the track. But they didn't have the best direction on what the end result should be. It's a shame.

Again. Not recommended unless you love playing Forza. BUT I must admit I am having fun with the game despite it's flaws. There is something here, but it's hidden under all of the small issues. Playing on my wheel, the game feels great! And even though I am hampered by the ""Build-Race-Dominate"" play mechanic (soon to be revised) when I find a car that I like, it I just want to drive the wheels off of it. Hopefully the game receives more performance fixes, and when the single player receives the ability to use credits instead of grinding for parts, then the game will be a full thumbs up. Still leaving it a non recommendation, but it is getting there. I did tell a few friends to check it out (on game pass) and one of them liked the game enough to get it.

So now I may be able to run most of a race without an issue, instead of an issue at every lap. Sadly, in the past, initiating a rewind would force the game to load parts of the environment that did not load previously, this no longer works. So now when the track doesn't load, it never loads.

But now, the track loads more often. This game is still a mixed back.

But I do love the handling model when things work, which is why I still try to get it to work. It is better than it was, but unfortunately it is still in a bad state compared to most racing games on the market.

Update Nov 14, 2023: The newest patch improves things a bit. But all the previous issues still exist but to a lesser extent. I still would not recommend it. 
 
Update Oct 17, 2023: They released a patch. Still doesn't work on my 3080Ti. I did experience server issues for a while today, but those have resolved themselves.

It doesn't work correctly on my newer machine with a 3080Ti. It works mostly fine on my older machine; it still has some issues, but ultimately playing it on an older machine means I can't play it in all its glory.

Pros & cons listed in order of importance (to me, obv).  All graphic critiques based on highest settings.

- always online single player (servers have worked for me but this is never preferred)
+ physics are fun with a controller (I haven't tried a wheel)
- AI is garbage in traffic (fixing this alone might change to a recommendation)
+ currently available tracks are generally good
- no Bathurst
- no Sonoma
- no Sebring
- no Road Atlanta
- no Brands Hatch
- car upgrade system is unnecessarily restrictive and annoying
+ AI can keep reasonable pace if no traffic
+ has NA, NC, and ND Miatas
- no NB Miatas
+ graphics have fleeting moments of near photo-realism
+/- graphics usually just look good to ok, but computery
- sometimes graphics look terrible (terrible SSR occlusion on windshield wipers in-car cam, buggy looking macro-blocking in reflections at times, some car models)
- occasional crashes/freezes but I've only had a couple over 35+ hours

If enough of these negatives are addressed, could be worth picking up in the future.  Prolly still gonna have that always online SP crap tho.

Edit: Finally tried a steering wheel and found another annoyance.  My wheel and shifter are mixed and matched (ie a G25 wheel with a Thrustmaster H shifter), and Forza likes to forget all the buttons I map every other time I launch the game, so every 2nd time I relaunch the game I have to reassign all my buttons/shift gears.

Frankly, for a game that was build from the ""ground-up"", it certainly doesn't feel that way. How can i not progress through the career mode and / or the featured career mode - without the game completely seizing up. Additional, having features still in play from Forza Motorsport 5, like the ""showroom"" is a little underwhelming. Also, don't get me started with the progression and UI...

From a massive studio and publisher to release an under-baked, under-polished and just plain broken game in 2023, is a little embarrassing. Not to mention the developers not being so prompt to address the issues, that have been echoed by consumers / players. 

What makes it a little harder to stomach, is that there's a more refined, polished and appealing alternative - Grand Tourismo 7 (GT7). Had Forza been give some more time to develop and learn / adapt features from GT7, i think this would be a monster of a racing sim. 

With that said - with all the bad, certainly comes some good. There's the potential to have a great racing sim here! The roster motor vehicles are great, the dynamic weather is awesome and it seems the online portion of the game is rather well too (if that's your thing).

I'll continue to ""watch this space"" and hope some of the most requested fixes are implemented. Then, i'll happily give this game another crack and update the review accordingly. Until then, there's only so many times i can do the same track and continue to lose progress.

**EDIT - 06/12/2023**
As per my review - i'd return and see how it's going, after an update or two.  Much of the same...still broken...

**EDIT - 19/02/2024**
Again, as stated above in my review. I promised to return after the game received some updates. Every notification i received about the game and the released / planned release of updates were met with some promise. Now that i have booted it up again - it's further confirmed to me, that there's nothing that was done to address the above-mentioned issued. Those are some of the same issues, that's being echoed by other users for some time - those of which who have many more hours of play than myself. 
Frankly, after five or so months, i have lost hope. The game appears to be poorly managed as they have not addressed some of the core concerns....

In short - please, find something else to play and / or wait for when GT7 is released on PC (unknown at this stage).",1699063247,1708307355,False,2,0,0.527972042560577393,0,True,False,False

I LOVE Forzas driver feel. even on controller is damn near feels like im on the road with the car im driving, that's about the only positive i have. 

other than that game feels like they've been taking away instead of adding or showing this "" new "" game they've mentioned, the "" LACK "" list is far greater than anything new and or improved. Its Forza nothing has changed, its the same as 4-7 just Far less tracks, cars, actual events to partake in, and engagement. there was a time when Nordschleife came out of the box, hell you couldve done it backwards if you wanted to, and you had like 10 different miatas to choose from. lack of actual events to choose, no real diversity unless you want to wait every week for a new race... what happened Turn 10? stop listening to these boring cry baby streamers and shady shareholders! 

multiplayer? yeah lol i'm not even going to bother... they have literally taken AWAY EVERYTHINGGGGG its HILARIOUS 

one last VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL 

All i'm saying is a Subaru shouldn't sound like a civic.

I wanted to update my review because I just encountered another CTD (crash to desktop).

After five ""patches and updates"" and 200 hours of gameplay, my review still stands as it is. I've practically spent every hour of this game, solely because I hate wasting money. I was unable to refund this game because I still held hope for its improvement in the future. However, after 5 months, this game hasn't improved one bit. Old game-breaking issues have been replaced by new ones. Drip-feed cars are constantly released with bugs. There's still no quality control before releasing something.

I feel scammed by the TURN10 marketing department and Microsoft. I'm saddened and tired of this crap.

P.S. They rushed the Nordshleife (Green Hell) update to attract more buyers. GUYS! It's not worth it!!!

Below is my previous review, which still holds true to this day.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two-Hour Steam Refund? Nah, We Need More Time!

Seriously, a measly two-hour Steam refund window just doesn't cut it for a game like this. The longer these devs drag their feet on updates and fixes, the more I'm feeling like I got ripped off.

The actual racing experience in this game is like strapping into the driver's seat of a rocket. But the real party happens in multiplayer. I can't even describe the adrenaline and the pure, unadulterated fun you get from racing against other players. It's like an emotional rollercoaster in all the right ways.

But, hold on to your helmets because there are some serious issues here. I don't get it – did Turn10 even bother playtesting this thing? There's a laundry list of bugs, and some are just plain infuriating. The constant loss of progress in singleplayer and those infinte loading screens are maddening. What's worse is that these bugs are like uninvited guests who just won't leave. I snagged the pre-release version, and it wasn't nearly as messy. But the more I try to dive in, the more bugs and crashes rear their ugly heads.

The prize event session will conclude soon, and I still haven't managed to finish the crucial single-player event. It seems highly unlikely that I'll complete it in time, potentially causing me to miss out on the prize cars!

Now, this is what baffles me. After sinking countless hours into Horizon 4 and 5 and absolutely loving every second, this game feels like it's from a completely different universe. Turn10, did you accidentally misplace your final build and substitute it with some half-baked alpha or beta version? It's like going from a five-star meal to a microwave dinner.

If you start a race series, you can't change your car, you have to stick with the same car in the entire series or restart the series.

Crashed after winning a race twice

Crashed on race start


No Maserati Granturismo....
No Nurburgring Nordschliefe

But I'm sure those will come by as DLC that they will happily take your money for.

Steam has asked me to revise my review since I first wrote this.

Still do not recommend. The game crashes constantly, mainly right after a race victory and it wont save it, so I find myself replaying the same race. There's also a sound glitch with some cars where it sounds like a gieger counter...

A recent patch now has the optimization worse than ever. I keep coming back after a couple weeks with hopes it will get better. I'm using about 50% of my VRAM but the gameplay and cinematics are still very choppy.

Update 3:

Crashed twice while trying to open

I do not like the slow feed of single player content. Forza 3 and 4 would have a campaign trail but then also allow you access to well over 100 events so you may pretty much race anywhere with any car. This isn't a complete failure, the cars look nice, the physics is good and the driving feedback to the player is surprisingly good, I can tell when cars are slipping or losing traction. I still do not recommend this game. This isn't going to be something that can be fixed, it seems like it's an issue with the roots of the game. Go back to the drawing board and look at FMS 3 and 4, those were very well received.

Since then it's been fixed for the most part. There are some worryingly long multiplayer race loading screens but it's been quite awhile since one of those has led to a crash. 

The multiplayer races also start on a time based system around every 15/20 minutes making the time to entry into a race pretty long. If you join at the wrong time you can be left waiting 20m in practice for the previous race to end. Once you're in it flows well but it's tough to hop in for a race during a wfm lunch break. 

I think the replay-ability is significantly dampened by the car points system. I have so many hours in game, yet every time I buy a new car for a new campaign or online race I have to spend another hour or 2 grinding just to get race tires. That's good to get me used to the car but not fun. 

Overall the physics feel solid - it's much more serious racing than Horizon for example but the AI isn't great and the progression system sucks. For $70 I wouldn't get it again.

2/11/24 UPDATE: A crash-to-desktop bug when just playing the fucking game? Hasn't this been out for months already? What the fuck, Microsoft?

2/1/24 UPDATE: I finished Dry January yall! And I'm celebrating with an IPA! And some more to add to my Forza review!

It's been two months since I've played and the same bugs are STILL THERE after I decided to dip my toe in again. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! Did my $100 purchase not help fund some fixes for this abomination? I'll probably consider buying a PS5 and GT7 just to get the experience I'm actually wanting!

I'm just now at the soap-boxing stage now; and my rants are only going to get angrier and angrier as I keep coming back to this fucking game to see if it's even remotely fun, like I'm an abused spouse or something.

12/6/23 UPDATE: Forza, I love you so much, but this is the last straw. I have purchased every Forza day 1 since the OG, even shelling out for the Ultimate edition cause I LOVED the franchise and wanted to support it! Not anymore. The handling and gameplay itself is still great and grips me, but the graphical issues continue to plague me which is unacceptable for a company backed by MICROSOFT. Also the upgrade system in the career mode... It is the worst addition I have EVER seen in the franchise.

Good job, Turn 10 - you turned literally turned away a customer who would shell out whatever price you wanted for the games and packs because you thought you were being innovative. Get fucked.

11/17/23 UPDATE: I'm an uncle now! My nephew was born today!

I still wouldn't recommend Forza for a single-player person. Career fucking sucks. The upgrade system fucking sucks. It actively does not allow experimentation.

Anyhow, I'll still play it, but I would not recommend it unless it were like $20.00.

11/5/23 UPDATE: The gameplay is great - cars feel amazing and it's a hell of a time racing across tracks. But the entire experience is just held back by the stupidass upgrade system (that promotes WAY TOO MUCH GRINDING) and now the game keeps freezing and crashing on me. Microsoft is a $1bil+ company, WTF is this.

------------------------

OG Review: I'm a VERY VERY VERY longtime Forza player, ever since the OG Xbox Forza, so it really pains me to write this review, for the current state of Motorsport.

Forza for me was always a celebration of cars and automotive design and racing them - and I adored the franchise because of that through every single Motorsport and Horizon game; I didn't miss ANY of them and dumped an insane amount of hours into each entry.

I can forgive the rocky launch - but the core design of events, career, and the upgrade system are dealbreakers for me. The physics in this game feel great, there is no problem with that. But I really hate how rigid the upgrade system in this game is - I really prefer being able to switch to different cars throughout a single racing series just to see how they do against each other, and this entry doesn't let you do that. I want to be able to build my cars up to be the best in a competitive class, a la Horizon, especially when I can inject some creativity into whatever I'm racing. This game doesn't let you do that.

I do intend to play more - absolutely, but not for much longer if this is how the game treats its ""celebration"" of cars. Maybe just a few more hours to scratch the itch and then I can go back to Cyberpunk full time. 

Sorry, Forza - I fucking love you but I wouldn't recommend you to myself pre-purchase.",1697074448,1708125477,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Embarking on a journey with ""Forza Motorsport,"" I found myself navigating through a labyrinth of bugs, crashes, and lost progress rather than indulging in the exhilarating races I anticipated. The single-player mode, which should have been a heaven for solo gamers, is regrettably marred by persistent crashes and disheartening loss of progression, rendering it essentially unplayable. A glaring gap yawns between the developers' promises of a seamless and immersive racing experience and the reality, where the player is frequently yanked from their high-speed fantasy due to disruptive technical issues. It's vital for the trust between developers and the gaming community that future releases uphold a standard of honesty, quality, and transparency that was notably absent in this release.

Another bad game in 2023 and another bad game from Xbox Game Studios. But atleast in 2023 ChatGPT can write my comments to this mess.

The tone-deaf gameplay mechanics aside, Turn 10 just can't get this game to run worth a damn on the PC platform. It has got to be the most inconsistently performing gaming I've ever played. One moment, beautiful scenery, lighting and reflections, at a buttery smooth 60fps. The next moment, lighting is all janky, and the framerate takes a nose dive down to 14fps. With the latest patch (Update 5) promising to improve CPU and GPU utilization, thus improve PC performance, they've done just the opposite. Up till then, I had no issues with video memory (RTX 3080 11G). Now, I'm getting constant warnings that my video memory is too low, and I'll probably see poor performance. My guess is that their solution to the GPU issue, as to just grab as much VRAM as possible for no reason at all. Frames have easily dropped 10-20% in the latest update. Forza Motorsport 2023 has been a constant series of false promises. I was hopeful in January when they said they were aware and working on hot topics that maybe the game would turn around, but here we are, with yet another promise falling through. I would love to try the new changes to car progression, but performance is so abysmal now, that I actually get a headache playing. I have just shy of 71 hours at the time of writing, and there's only about 10 of those that weren't painful. There was a nice sweetspot for a bit, where the game ran like a dream, and I had a blast, but now we're worse than we were at launch. 6 years in the oven, and still we had an incomplete, and unstable mess of a game. As of writing this, save your money, play something else. This game will just disappoint you, and it pains me to say that, but it's just a glorified tech demo.

After limited testing on patch 5 I am seeing decent performance improvements, The races are taking longer to load up and the pre-race splash screens are pretty jittery for 30 seconds or so but the frame rate in the actually races seems a lot more consistent. I feel with the fixes in this version I will change my rating from negative to positive.... however if Steam had a mixed option I would probably choose that just because the single player where you select your own grid place when they could easily add 1 lap, 1 shot qualifying would actually make it feel like a game rather than just random races and they still haven't fixed the blurry visuals. Still a long way to go but this was a big step in the right direction for me.

(Original review)
Sadly I can't recommend this game, I played the original version of the game for 15 hours with no crashing but since they released the first update it is now crashing to desktop when the first race finishes and it loads to the menu every single time. I have done all the usual things, updated driver, verified files ect.. but it's the same spot after any race it happens.

Apart from that the game still looks kind of blurry even running ultra settings. 

I would honestly wait for a sale maybe in a few months because like most of Microsoft games they should not be released in the states they are. Redfall was a mess, Starfield was a mess but for many more reasons than just performance and Forza Motorsport while an improvement over the series in many ways just should not release in this condition.

Edit 2: Taken 4-5 months to get there, but finally Update 5 brings much needed performance improvements - even if the graphics are still nothing to write home about. And The 'Ring, credit to the Nordschleife where it is due. A.I. opponents are still as dumb as a stone casket filled with rocks, which should be the number one priority now in my opinion. Still, making progress.

This is not the game I was expecting. Sure, this isn't the first time I have been burned by pre-launch hype and pretty trailers - Warhammer 40K Darktide springs to mind for me. But this WAS supposed to be a revolutionary new game 6 years in the making, and it has been two years since all updates to FM7 stopped!

The graphics are barely acceptable, bordering on bad if your consider price and reputation/pre-launch hype. I bought a Radeon 7900XTX half because of this game (and half because my second-hand probably mined to death RTX 3080 died suddenly). Playing at native 4K, maximum setings without ray-tracing; the game looks like a single generation 18-24 month improvement over FM7, plays at 80-100 fps with regular hard frame drops 2-3 times a lap.
Edit: As of the current v1.1 of the game, I no longer get more than 60-70fps in the single player campaign, with many tracks sitting in the 40-50 range. But my GPU is barely ticking over. AMD drivers doing AMD things, or is the game's performance even more broken than it was before?!?

The AI is still as dumb as a box of rocks. The number of times I have been spun by a tap on the rear end... Or the number of times I've run straight into the back of an AI car because it brakes for no readily apparent reason at a slight curve on a mostly straight-away. 

The career/car progression is very much an evolution on FM7. You pick an event, and you have to play that event in order to unlock the next event. The car section is highly limited for almost all events, and the only ones that are open to any car within a broad performance restriction are unlocked at the very end of a series of events. The whole ""caR-PG"" thing rings very hollow. You can't 'bond' or 'grow' with a particular car, because you buy one car to complete an event and then move on. Only difference is that you now have to play for hours to unlock the privilege to properly tune a car!

On which note, car customisation is flat out worse. Instead of grinding one currency (in-game money), you how have three: money to buy a car, experience points to unlock car levels and therefore possible upgrades, and car points to buy those upgrades. And linking back to the above point; no, you only need to drive a car long enough to unlock the basic upgrades. At which point is not worth tuning much more than your tyre pressures, maybe final drive ratio and brake pressure & balance.

There is one positive, and yes I am purposefully burring it at the bottom of this wall of text. Driving a car DOES feel a lot more complex. I won't weigh in to the whole sim-racing vs realism debate, but it is more complicated. You can really play (deliberate choice of the word play there) with driving-based effects like lift-off overseer, or counter-steering and throttle inputs in a four-wheel drift, or braking mid-turn with a front brake bias to kick out the rear-end of a front-wheel-drive car. The whole tyre physics update is the one part of pre-release marketing I can say is a real upgrade to the game.",1697310738,1708034183,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'll leave that comment below, but after 130 hours, I suppose I have something more tempered to say (you can listen to my friends and I debate this subject on our podcast called Emotive Pixels, episode ""Forza Motorsport: Criticism Chicane"" if you feel like it). There's a frustration and confusion in me, because the core game here is fantastic, the handling is superb, things look great, but at about 100 hours it hits you how lifeless it is, which is a shame when a franchise I really don't want to compare to has a mode where you literally get coffee with car creators. I just wish some of that life were here, and heck, it's not like previous Forzas had it either, it's just the one thing I really want for the franchise. I still recommend it, it's great, but it is a bit strange how creaky it can feel, how barebones it can be.

---------- ORIGINAL REVIEW

Do y'all remember how there was a time where the entire sim racing community was united by ONE THING - that Horizon was way too giving with cars and it wasn't fun and that was the single thing ruining racing games? *looks at 25% of the reviewers here* DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THIS?!

It's launch day for a big long-term franchise. I was here for Flight Simulator on Day 1 as well and it feels similar (though I feel Forza is in a better place than FS was at launch). I suspect many things are to come. Meantime, I've been glued to this thing since launch because the handling is great, and the career is deep and challenging in a way I haven't felt in a long time.

There is a good game to be found here. The driving mechanics are solid. The car selection is decent. The track selection is maybe a bit light. The addition of proper tyre and fuel management is very welcome. The difficulty can be tuned however you'd like it. You can set up races quite easily, with almost any restriction you'd want. It would be a solid racing game, except...

[h2]None of that matters.[/h2]

The culprit is the worst progression system I have ever seen in a racing game. Maybe in any game period.

Whereas previous Forza games allowed you to pick virtually any car, and upgrade it however you wanted, this game doesn't. This game actively forbids you to do that.

Everything is tied to the new Car XP and Car Points system. And calling it a bad system is doing an insult to badness. It's more than bad, it's hateful.

The system is really simple: the more you drive a car, the more upgrades you unlock for it and the more Car Points you can spend on applying those upgrades. Per each individual car. Not per model, per car. It will take you a handful of hours to reach the max level. For every. single. car.

If you want to build the racecar of your dreams, you'll have to take a stock car, race it stock, add upgrades almost one by one, doing races upon races before you're finally allowed to have what you wanted. Unless of course what you wanted wasn't ppossible, but there is no way to know before you invest all that time in.

It's a system that isn’t fair, that isn’t fun, that doesn't respect your time, and it's just absurd.

I can't in good conscience recommend this game. Not without the understanding that you'll be driving a bunch of production cars stock and will scarcely have the ability to upgrade them. The actual racecars luckily have already most the upgrades you'd expect on a racecar. Anything else, the hot hatches, the GTs, the supercars, don't expect doing an engine swap any time soon. Because you won't be able to.

[b]Update 1.0:[/b] The grind has been reduced to unlock parts. It still takes the same amount of time to grind for Car Points though. It's still a fundamentally broken system. This doesn't change my review. It's still the worst idea of all time.

The change to having to unlock car parts via XP is interesting in theory, but in practice it just slows down progression. Racing Lagoon this is not.

Car selection is alright, but there's still no very low end cars; in Forza 4 you started in sub 100HP cars; here you start in what would be considered mid game cars in the earlier entries.

The car handling is also just okay, it's aiming to feel more like proper simulators such iRacing and Assetto Corsa, but cars overall feel too under-steer-y and it's very difficult to correct mistakes. Racing wheel support is there, but it will always switch to a wheel's default profile on startup.

Final Update: To get Forza to recognize my PS5 DualSense Controller fully, I had to first connect it to my PC by wire (not Bluetooth). Set Steam>Settings>Controller to PS4 Controller.  Go to the Forza Motorsport gamepage and click Controller there, then make sure it is set to PS4 Controller at the top (and not Dualsense Wireless Controller), Recommended Template should be set to Offical Layout for Forza Motorsport - Gamepad with camera controls.  Your Controller blue bubble should be pointing to the middle. Run the DualSenseX program and set the controller emulation to DualShock 4.  Then start the game. If you decide to use the DualSense Wireless Controller, in the Forza game homepage controller settings, then make sure you find the Ps5 template Gyro control, and then turn the Gyro setting to OFF -- unless you want to try to use it.

Cons:  When E cars are used for races sometimes, the races are done on long tracks (2-3min laps). E Class cars are slow enough as it is and this makes gameplay incredibly boring as you work to get their car level up to C class.  If you want to fall asleep, this is the way to do it.  After you complete the game initially, you can now attempt these others tours except you have to drive really slow cars more often than before.  This makes the fun drop considerably.

This game is probably the most vivid example of a lynch mob mentality among players of any game I've ever seen. I decided to analyze the situation and see what happened.

First of all, let's start with the composition of user reviews. When a game has ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" user reviews, there is rarely one defining factor that causes the reviews to be so positive. The same can't be said for reviews that are mostly negative. Generally speaking, you have one predominant issue that many people point out. This frequently balloons into ""everything is wrong"" sorts of reviews, and, no matter whether positive or negative, there are always a few people so angry and disconnected from reality that you wonder if they played the same game. 

I actually gathered a bunch of examples from all of these that I was going to post here, but decided that would be rude. People can have their opinions, and I'm a poor person to select to speak about other people writing dumb things. I do it all the time. Sometimes my emotions about a game take over, and I write a scathing review that I later become embarrassed about. It happens. I understand what it's like to be disappointed about a game, and so my review here isn't really criticizing anyone. It's just pointing out what happened. But let's get to the point...

The two things that are mentioned most in negative reviews are that the developer lied about the game being ""built from the ground up"" and bugs/optimization problems. To quickly speak to the latter, bugs on PC are sometimes related to specific systems, as sometimes are optimization problems. For this reason, I can only speak of my experience, but wouldn't consider my experience to be representative of the entire community. For me, after over 100 hours on Game Pass, but only a couple of hours on Steam, I haven't noticed any significant bugs. There have been a couple of small things here or there, but definitely nothing that impacted my overall experience. As for optimization, my experience is that the game is optimized at this point about the same as FH5. Take it or leave it. Your experiences on your systems will likely vary. As for occasional connection issues, there has never been a Forza game without them, so nothing to see here.

The big issue, which was the inspiration for this review, is really the phrase ""built from the ground up"", and the truth is that, while Turn10 did utter those words on multiple occasions, they were always related to something specific. Turn10 never, that I can recall or find, stated that the entire game was ""built from the ground up"", only that large parts of it were; for instance, the AI, the physics and locations, and, most important to our discussion, the materials and shaders used for car model finishes. This is extremely important because the lynch mob mentality started when YouTubers and folks on reddit noticed that the game was using, in some cases, old car models. This quickly ballooned into Turn10 lying about building the game from the ground up, but they never actually said all the models were new. They said the materials and shaders were new (to simplify, materials in game development are paint). But it didn't matter what Turn10 actually said. As is usually the case, no one actually cared if this was accurate. They were just mad. 

Just as a side note on this. There are several hundred cars in the game, and while most of them were built from scratch, a number of them used older models. With that many cars, my personal opinion is that having a few older models is not exactly equivalent to treason. But if you feel they all should have been brand new, I won't argue with you. That would have been nice.

Another thing that I would like to mention is the much maligned singleplayer campaign. Many seem to hate it, but they never go into detail about what you are getting. For starters, there is no story, just a series of championships to participate in, just as in other Motorsport games and nearly every racing sim. That can be good or bad depending on the player. There are 4 permanent major series and 2 additional series, one special and one that changes every so often like the weekly challenges. So at any given time there are 6 series and usually at least one new one. I can't say this will always be the format, as these things tend to change. Each one of these series has 4 championships of either 5 or 6 races. I didn't count how many had 5 and how many had six, so to be pessimistic, let's just say they all have 5. So you have 24 championships of 5 races, so the singleplayer career has 120 races. Only you can decide whether this format or quantity is enough for you if you are primarily a singleplayer person, but each of those races will last about 15 minutes, so that's 30 hours if you do nothing but those races one after another, never decorating your cars, never running any custom races or multiplayer or never start a race over (guilty), etc. And this also ignores the new series that are always being added.

One final bone of contention is the CARPG style of leveling and improving your cars. I understand why people who want to do nothing but race would dislike it. That's fine. It's a grind. Actually, I didn't think I would like it at all, but now I think it adds character and strategy to each championship. 

So there you go. Those are my largely rambling thoughts on the game and why it is rated so lowly. By the way, professional reviews and Xbox players seem to disagree pretty significantly. Even PC Game pass players seem to like the game okay. The bottom line is that this game is not nearly as bad as the Steam and metacritic user reviews would lead you to believe. In fact, I think it's quite good.",1707430496,1707431235,True,119,15,0.622790336608886719,0,True,False,False

But alas, here I am, $100 in the hole for preorder with a game that I can barely run with an i9 and a 3070. The memory leaks are insane, resulting in an abrupt crash every 2-5 races. If you're really unlucky, you'll crash while crossing the finish line, causing you to reset progress on the event. I would L O V E this game... if it worked...

Until they fix the GOD DAMN CRASHES, this review will remain negative. 

All this hype, and for what?

Fuck this, I'm going to go play F1 23. At least that game runs longer than 2 races and doesn't lock me to >20FPS.

Update: I uninstalled this game for MONTHS and played F1 23 instead and while I'm proud to say my driving skill has improved playing F1 23, this games issues hasn't improved one bit. Hate to say it cause all I want is to just play this game w/o issues, but at the current moment I just can't. I guess I'll just have to be happy with only getting through practice before my game crashes on the race. Thanks, Turn10, for taking $100 USD from me just for me to practically not be able to play your game and CERTAINLY not enjoy it how I'd like to. But keep ignoring my customer support emails, that helps a ton c: Thanks, for nothing.

I have a high tolerance for unpolished/ unfinished games but this is just too much to handle. From my time playing i honestly enjoyed the racing but you can't just judge a racing game by the quality of its racing. I've been a fan of forza motorsport since 6, then had a hiatus shortly after 7 was released, so when I built a new PC a few months ago I learned that 6 and 7 weren't available to purchase anymore so i was a bit bummed out by that. Then i learned they were making this and i was so excited to finally have a new motorsport game.

Anyway, the racing was fun, the graphics are good (but for a forza game they should be astounding) and the car selection is nice (I especially appreciate the amount of actual race cars that are included. But that's about where the good ends. The track selection (while having maple valley which is a great inclusion) is very small and ,in my opinion, lacking some very important tracks like Sebring (They have added new tracks!). 

When it comes to performance, I have fairly good luck with this game. It runs at an almost constant 60 fps at 1080p with maxed settings (my specs are: RTX 3060ti, core i5 13600k and 36 gb of ddr5 5600 ram), however I do have the occasional frame rate drop and textures loading in slowly.

Then there is the elephant in the room. The single player campaign is terrible. Thats what made me want to write this review. There is absolutely no endgame style content. No endurance races, no challenge missions, and from what i can tell no actual events that use real race cars. It looks to me that it just ends with supercars. The game with a cadillac hypercar doesn't have an event in which you can compete in it with. Due to the lack of events, it feels like there's no reason to race, let alone play the game. I do have hope though. I really REALLY hope they atleast add endurance races, this game can almost certainly do so well with them. Until some of these issues are fixed, this review will stay negative.

EDIT: I saw that there had been some updates to this game, including some new tracks so i thought id come back to try them out. I didn't even get past one race. I highly advise anyone who is playing this game to not play on Le Mans with the old mulsanne straight, despite many updates the game still cant render the entire straight, leading to literally over half of the straight not loading. Additionally while using the Roush Whistler Mustang, I encountered a bug where it would automatically shift up into second gear cause it hit ~8500 rpm. Then it would just... downshift again? But that's not the best part, the game would realize ""oh hey, we're at 8500 rpm"" then it would shift into second then just downshift again. this would happen over and over for about 10 seconds, therefore making the Ford Chicanes damn near impossible.",1696989931,1707356742,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

I will also note most of the optimization problems have been fixed by now but this game still has a ton of downsides right now.

Coming back to Forza Motorsport after skipping FM7 because of how much of a disaster it was, and while this game fixes many of FM7's issues... but introduces a whole load of new ones.

The Good:
- The handling is a GREAT balance between arcade and realistic.
- Power-shifting is FINALLY gone.
- Track design is a huge step up from Forza Motorsport 7. A lot of improvements not just in realism but also flow. Suddenly 20 tracks on launch doesn't seem so bad.
- While not perfect, the penalty system and the new format to do qualifying races first DOES help people drive a little cleaner. I will say though, being penalized for being rear-ended is problematic though. Work on it.
- NO BS micro transactions like GT7.

The Bad:
- Sounds: while the sounds are a improvement over Forza Motorsport 7, there are SOME sounds that are just flat out inaccurate. Like the Sauber C9 sounds like a 4 cylinder, or the AMG One doesn't have that F1-esque electrical whine (long story short FH5 did that one better).
- MISSING CARS: There are some cars that we saw in the trailers (Eg. Audi R10) that are questionably missing from the day-one car list. For a Motorsport game, this game really lacks touring cars and prototypes, and some of the most recognizable GT cars are missing, too. Big shame! Suddenly 500 cars on launch seems like nothing.
- AI... The AI seems to sometimes not know when to try to pass or defend. This also leads to a group at the back and three to four AI drivers at front.
- Track list... 20 tracks on launch is whatever, but HOW can you launch a game without Monza! (Edit, Hockenheim got added) 
Even Imola and Sebring are missing as well. All of these were featured in prior games.
I hope we get these soon rather than never, because it would be a big shame to see a big-budget racing game without these couple of iconic tracks.
- New mechanics nobody asked for: And my absolute biggest problem? Well I was really looking forwards to the car leveling system. Using credits ONLY to unlock new cars was like a breath of fresh air in a desert, because I am beyond tired of people shoving the highest power engine into a car, and slapping Forza aero onto it (By the way can we PLEASE hide those ugly wings??) and calling it a day. But the fact it can take over THREE HOURS to max-level ONE car is absolutely ridiculous. They advertised that it would take 2 hours at most, yeah no, that's just too much. The problem got partially fixed recently with most parts being unlockable by level 20, but now you're bottlenecked on Car Points when you're trying to do your build, that's a big problem.
- Excessively unfinished: minor details like car dashboards on some cars are messed up. Some cars have incorrect preview images (like having Forza aero). Huge problem. If this game was 'built from the ground up', what ground was it built up from?
- Big lack of Single-player content. Does Microsoft not understand that people play these types of games for single player career modes too?

The Ugly:
- Okay, so I was never told this nor does it actually say so, but this is a HUGE problem for me, WHY does this game require an always-online internet connection?! This is a terrible decision, I live in an area where internet is spotty at best and often goes out, so I can randomly lose progress on a series because of that.

While I will continue playing because, the game is FUN, and the handling, whether I'm on wheel or controller feels genuinely GOOD, and the menus while not great, is FAR better than FM7... and the visuals are definitely good even on low settings. Although I've yet to try multiplayer... which I hear lots of complaints about. And I did end up shelling out money for the ultimate edition... And I've played other games that have bad optimization. But for the time being, WAIT to buy this game. Probably just skip on it. Even if you have a good rig.

The game had a lot of potential to be good but... it's missing everything that made the 360 titles good... if this wasn't the only Forza Motorsport game on Steam, I'd be playing Forza Motorsport 4 instead...

Sadly there are significant issues, even this long after launch. Long after game breaking bugs have been fixed. 

The online multiplayer is a fruitless endeavour due to the number of collisions with other drivers, which can put you half a lap behind while the person that rammed you (intentionally or otherwise) continues merrily on their way with at most a 1 second penalty. The AI in single-player is even worse, it brakes midway down a straight but not when it's right behind you on a curve. Tyre wear is inexplicable and excessive, with cars impossible to drive after 7 laps on the same tyres. 

The driving experience solo is good. I want to drive in this game. But it's a racing game, and you just can't race. Months after launch and the developers are twiddling with the obnoxious car part unlocking system, not fixing the core fundamental basics that would make the game worth playing.

This feels like just another iterative step in the Forza Motorsport series that in some aspects goes the wrong direction.  

The driving is the best it’s ever been in a Forza Motorsport game, but it feels like a marginal upgrade.  Visuals are underwhelming, uneven, and inaccurate.  The game opts for a hazy, almost washed out, visual style, which does not look particularly attractive.  Forza Horizon 5, despite being an open world game, appears to me to provide better image quality and more world detail than this game.  AI is still awful with all the faults of past games. AI driven cars appear to have no awareness of you or each other.  Tracks with tight first turns still result in chaos.  AI drivers that speed ahead of the pack are still encountered regularly. The career mode is bare bones.  The move to a car level system for upgrades makes no sense to me.  The reasoning was to force people to get to know a car and build it up as they progress with it, but that’s not how the career mode is structured.  Career mode is built around cups for specific car categories.  Most will require switching to a different car for them.  I suppose the class based series could use that built up car, but do you really want to use a VW Golf against super cars? Even then, they are a subset of the available content and the minority.  Previous entries in the series provided a much better career mode.  Here there’s no soul, passion, or variety.  Additionally, navigating through the game requires excessive menus and mini cutscenes to get through. In some of these menus your car is shown awkwardly with a  gray void as the backdrop. 
 
I understand building a new game engine requires a lot of time and effort, but what matters is the end result and this doesn’t deliver.  The comparison to GT7 can't be ignored either, which in my opinion is the better game in every way.

If you want a clue as to what the problems are - take a look below. This thing is just an endless disaster. One positive is that they'll keep your inbox on the landing page filled with bug riddled DLC if you go for the top level purchase like my dumb ass did.

Do yourself a favor and stay away. Oh, and below are the main issues.

12/23/2023: I believe that this studio will need to make severe adjustments to the UI to make the game feel polished. I believe that this game has a physics system that has set the ground work for a really decent game.

I truly believe that this game can be great if the development team takes actions on the following items:

[u]Race Length/Strategy[/u]: Every race feels way too short. I'm not sure exactly how to keep the racing interesting with longer racing - maybe just keep it to spec races or introduce 30-45 minute long races with expedited practice sessions. [u]I think you spend WAY too much time waiting for the race to start.[/u] I think you can handle qualification by incorporating fastest track time with ghosts during the practice. It will require Turn10 to remove what ever bug allows players to put down an impossibly fast lap time by sitting on the starting line and skipping a lap but I suspect that should be fairly easy to fix... what do I know.

[u]UI/QOL[/u]: It's unintuitive - you spend a lot of time sliding from one screen to another for the sake of sliding to another screen. A lot of the actions that take place in the game can be simplified to get to where you want to go without all kinds of additional steps. Something as simple as changing a vehicle in the middle of practice requires you to click exit, click quit practice, click tune, click select car... how about just tune and select car. Again, it doesn't sound like a lot of work to do the first one, but you need to remember that the screen goes black and goes to a montage of the car your currently driving in the pits. It's another load screen that I don't think really needs to be there.

[u]Penalties[/u]: The penalty system is a bit of a mess. I've seen several occasions where a pile of cars get thrown off the track on the first turn and the only vehicles getting penalties are the folks that tried to avoid the collisions by slowing down and getting a little too far off the track. The person who pile drove the cars off the track tends to get very little for the crime and the others that are trying to be competitive in the corner pay the price. Severe penalties for VERY minimal track infractions while a pit maneuver gets you a better position on the track. Not always but often enough.

[u]FPS on PC[/u]: FPS cap on PC for multiplayer is not right. Also, the odd FPS drop at random times is extremely frustrating and should be something that is addressed as soon as possible.

[u]Upgrades[/u]: The system has to go. It takes absolutely forever to get a vehicle to a position to make it viable to play against other drivers online. You will sit on a track for 45 minutes to an hour to get the vehicle to level 35-40 to have enough points to get to where you want to go. There are clear exceptions to this with regards to the ""R"" touring and true track vehicles but anything that is commercially available will take an hour of your time to find out if it's even viable for the PI (performance index) you want to try and race with. Also, it might be a good idea to think about a quick upgrade system that takes into account the PI you're trying to target - not apply as many upgrades as possible with the ""points"" you have from practicing with the vehicle. Forza gives out plenty of money. Let us use it to upgrade the vehicles.

I think the car models need some polish and I truly wish the campaign of the game would be adjusted in a way to make it interesting in almost any way possible. It feels extremely rushed, disinterested, and flat out boring. It doesn't feel as if there is anything interesting going on. I'm just a dude with unlimited access to 500+ vehicles... that's it. I've finished them all and I can't think of a single memorable race/time playing it. The races are far too short and the AI are Neanderthals - even when pumped up to ""8"", the hardest setting.

Overall, it's been a trip playing through some of the worst racing this series has ever had to offer. The positive news is that it is starting to get better. It has MUCH further to go to get to anywhere near what one would expect for a development cycle that took six years. I truly hope that Turn10 learned a VERY valuable lesson from this experience and work towards fixing the unbelievable amount of bad blood that they've created with their simcade community. Updates need to continue to roll out and they need to roll out much faster than they are right now. The baseline required stability is here now so that is good, but this needs a LOT of polish.

UPDATE - 12/10/2023: Things have started to be adjusted on the back end. The game is STARTING to feel a little bit better with the load screens and the transitions from menu to menu. There is still a lot of work to do on this game but I can sense that the folks back at HQ are starting to get this game under control.

I might add that having open class races that actually feel like races is coming off as extremely refreshing. I still think the spec races are good but to be able to get the cars maxed out (most of the time) on tuning is very nice.

I'm not ready to adjust this to a recommend just yet but this is definitely on it's way. The penalty system is still janky and there is still the initial contact at the first and second corners, but at least the game is starting to play like I suspected it was meant to.

Turn10 - still plenty of work but the adjustments are in the right direction.

(See, I can be nice)

UPDATE - 11/28/2023: TURN10 HAS LISTENED! NICE! This week the folks who paid way too much for this game get to compete in CLASS E for the open class and CLASSIC GRAND TOUR. That's right. For an entire week, you get to travel at >100 MPH races if you decide to participate.

I would be happy to work for you folks as a community manager to be an intermediary between players and your staff. Clearly Turn10 cannot read the room when it comes to what we want.

At least I'll be on vacation so I get to miss the week of garbage. Still don't buy this hot pile of shit.

UPDATE - 11/25/2023: Most folks have figured out the broken penalty system and have taken advantage of giving slight bumps when heavy turning in corners. If you don't get pulverized in the first corner and you're up front... you'll probably do just fine. Go ahead, put down that hot lap in qualifying... I feel it just puts a bullseye on your back and will likely lead to coming in middle pack. I love the 30 minutes in between the beginning of practice and the start of the race. It's a great time to reflect on the last 30 minutes of my life and my accomplishments for pole position - all to get rail roaded up my ass by someone in 8th who doesn't give a damn because there is a wall of cars to bounce off of in front of them.

Seriously, I love updating this review because it helps me let off some steam about a racing series I grew up on but this is a complete shit show. I get to wait weeks at a time in the hopes of racing an S or R class in the open series. 

Remember kids, there will only be two to three competitive cars that you'll have to spend half a day ranking up to see if they're competitive.

I'm not sure who the hell made these decisions but they need to be fired, immediately. Also, give us a god damn way to get into races quickly. If I'm going to get stretch marks on my ass cheeks in the first corner, at least make it so I don't have to wait 30 minutes to do so.",1699044006,1706913111,False,191,10,0.86236196756362915,4,True,False,False

Since update 3.0 of this month, I am no longer able to play the game because my (RX 590) graphics card's older architecture is getting less support from AMD. Many people in the community have been hurt by this, not just me.

I had fun playing this game only because I was able to play it with my friend. I love racing and bought this game to update my knowledge on the latest cars. This game DOES have modern cars, and the single-player career mode is something. I think that a set of investors were looking to release a moneymaker here, and it really shows when the most memorable part of my experience is unknowingly holding up a full, online race session because the game cannot apply a tune to my car.

The standard version of this game should sell for $25 because hot damn, every version falls short in so many ways. The lack of creativity and this short-sighted cash grab will make me think twice about anything Xbox publishes from here on. I get the sense this game will not last very long because people won't buy buy buy content that should be free. I'll eventually get a newer graphics card, but by that point, this game will be very dead. 

Only buy this game if it is on sale for cheap and you have not bought a racing game in over a decade. I'm sure then this game will be enjoyable without a friend to bully you online.

My hardware is five years old now but handles the game well, but on paper my GPU (a GeForce RTX 2080 XC Ultra) is not far off from an Xbox Series X. The console version is billed as performing at 4k and 60fps. Things have improved but I'm still barely able to maintain 60fps at 1440p. I'm turning off raytracing but I think most folks with an early RTX graphics card will tell ya turning it on murders frame rates. My other gripe is the attempt to separate bad drivers from good in multiplayer still isn't ideal. You can go through the multiplayer introduction and get rated [S] the highest safety rating. To round out the numbers in matchmaking the game seems to throw together whoever is available. So don't lose your cool when someone deliberately rams you. It's going to happen and it's frustrating but just focus on driving your best race.

The debatable: Many people do not like the changes to gameplay. Competitions available in multi-player rotate in availability, you can't easily play with just some friends in a private match, and the progression needed to be able to have all mods to a car available is a grind. [e.g. probably a dozen races including qualifying and practice sessions to get a Porsche 718 to level 50. The car's odometer is at 350 miles] For this I'd recommend checking out YouTube vids and the forums on what's on offer in multiplayer because the types of competitions rotate.

Single-player career mode is easier as you can adjust the difficulty of the other drivers as well as your car's difficulty and assists. You can even change your starting position and the game will estimate based on your cars performance index where you may place in the race. As in previous Forza Motorsport games you will compete in different single player race series' that tend to be themed. An American muscle car series, a grand tourer series, factory race car series, et cetera.

The good: I've played Forza Motorsports since Forza 2, and a few Forza Horizons. I'm enjoying the game greatly despite these foibles. It still has the Forza gameplay and physics I like. I'll be happier when the Nordschleife course is released with the next update in Feb '24.

The career is short and dull, a boring grid of events which is so slim most cars in the game don't have any events to use them in. But worse than this, the promise of a ""live service"" game turns out to be time-limited events which disappear a few weeks after they've been added, together with cars that the developers proudly claim will ""never be available again"". So you'll spend a fair chunk of your time in-game in a joyless grind to unlock cars you might otherwise never see again.

There's a lot of potential here in the physics, which are some of the best I've encountered in a game of this type, but if you're looking at buying the game now you'll already have 2-3 cars for which the models and textures are sitting on your hard drive and yet you will *never* be able to access them, because the game is designed around FOMO mechanics and time-limited content rather than having anything approaching a satisfying single-player mode. A problem which is only going to get worse over time.

I live in hope they'll realise this is one of the easier problems to fix and leave the events there to build out that too-small career mode, but right now it's a very expensive game that is just going to leave you annoyed every time it tells you something else is about to disappear without trace.

Add in the litany of complaints about poor quality 2005-era car models, technical issues and poor performance unless you have a high-end graphics card and fast SSD, and a laughable lack of attention to detail such as AI cars with widebody kits keeping their original wheel spacing, and unfortunately Forza Motorsport is firmly in the ""do not buy"" category right now.",1706750596,1706750642,False,11,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The physics are pretty good. accurate enough to be challenging (big difference from Horizon), but not pro-sim level that would be too much for most players.

2. I let AI drive overnight to get past the stupid, grindy CP system.

I didn't touch the game for nearly 2 months
I opened it because i saw an IMSA commentator make fun of Forza for still having the wrong pit exit at Daytona (It does). The game still runs awful with everything set to auto, there's still horrible stuttering issues and the game crashed right as I crossed the finish line on the one race I did.

--------------------------------------------------

I'm going to preface this by saying that this is my second forza game ever, the first one being FH4. I can't say I know what Forza Motorsport is supposed to feel like, but I've played plenty of Gran Turismo games as well as more dedicated sims like ACC.

If you want a summary, don't buy this.

With that out of the way, here's some of the things that made themselves painfully present throughout my playtime and keep in mind this is my first review.

Performance is awful, with everything set to auto at 1080p and a 60fps performance target, the game struggles to reach 50fps on a system with a 3070, a 12600k and 32gb of RAM, cut that in half if recording with OBS. Stuttering is common and has cost me races despite being the only app running and being on an NVMe drive.

The game will crash, and it will do so often, returning to the pits after practice, leaving a race, entering a race, booting the game, closing the game or even on the last frame before crossing the finish line (this last one specifically has happened on at least 3 occasions).

Graphically, the game looks okay, not great, and certainly not good enough to justify its performance. Liveries, billboards, and the asphalt ahead of you look blurry even up-close despite manually setting texture and livery details to the highest setting out of curiosity. I'd go so far as to argue that it looks worse than ACC bar some of the weather effects that use volumetric fog. Note that ACC launched in 2018 and runs at 100+fps while recording on the same computer.

This game is the home of one of the most interesting graphical bugs I've seen in a modern title. Occasionally, the game will gradually start unloading parts of the track, every lap another chunk of the map is gone, buildings in the distance, the pits, your car's roof, the runoff area and even the tarmac itself. The only exception being the track limits indicators, which at least keep it playable after everything else is gone.

Wheel support might as well be nonexistent given how poor the default settings are. The front wheel drive starter car gave me nothing until I threw it at a kerb and went limp when I moved off the kerb. I went over the two-hour refund window trying to fix force feedback on a wheel listed on their PC compatibility list and it was still considerably worse than other racing games; I ended up giving up and opting to use a controller.

The game's [i] blatant [/i] defects out of the way, how does it play when the planets line up and it becomes a playable experience?

Handling on a controller feels fine, the only noteworthy thing being that putting a tyre in the grass is a lot less forgiving than other games, it [i] will [/i] pull you off track. I'm not sure how I feel about this, so I'll let you decide if it's better or worse.

Campaign races consist of two parts: a practice session with a few required laps and an optional lap time bonus (you can only skip practice by going out on track, pausing, and going to the exit menu, which is annoying) and the race itself. There's no qualifying, instead there's a menu that lets you choose your starting position and gives you estimated finishing position.
Restarting practice has you go through two cutscenes and two loading screens. This is agonizing if you're on the strictest rules because you don't get to rewind.
Overall there’s little variety in the campaign and what’s there just isn’t fun enough, it gets boring fast.

Even on maximum difficulty the game only spawns 3-5 competent AIs. I'm far from the fastest driver but can start last and catch up to the top 5 in the first lap. AIs will sometimes blow past a turn and nail themselves into a wall by themselves, I like seeing Ais make mistakes that feel human, but they do this on every lap, leading to lapped traffic on a 4-lap race.

The AI struggles quite hard when racing in packs, slowing to a crawl when there's more than 2 cars going into a turn, or god forbid 2 cars going side by side. 
I'm fine with the AI being risk-averse but the slower AI still behaves like something out of Gran Turismo 5 brake checking you into a corner that should be flat.

The upgrade system is bizarre, parts don't cost credits, instead being unlocked by levelling up the car and costing ""car points"" (begging the game and community to stop abbreviating this) which are also tied to your car's level and are meant to stop people from just putting the best parts on the car. I don't like it and thankfully don't have to interact with it often outside of the campaign.

Multiplayer has spec races, open races, and Rivals. I've mostly stuck to spec races so that's what I'll talk about.

Spec races completely omit car progression and upgrades, you can enter a race with a car you don't own by renting it, the downsides to this being that you don't get xp to level it up and you can't tune it. This is not an issue unless you're at a track that needs drastic tune changes like La Sarthe with its Mulsanne straight.

I haven't seen any medium or long races show up in the calendar, so everything's been 4 laps or around 7-10 minutes, often less than the practice time.

The game seems to want to force tyre strategy into these shorter races by massively upping tyre deg. A set of hards will finish 4 laps around La Sarthe with severe degradation, even in shorter circuits softs are just enough to get you through the 3 qualifying laps before you start getting warnings for tyre degradation.

The penalty system was bound to disappoint, given what was promised before release, and it does. It's very inconsistent in when it'll punish a player. Sometimes blatant rammers don't get penalties, sometimes you get an avoidable contact penalty for bumping into a car that spun and was blocking most of the track.

If I haven't made myself clear, this is not a good product, don't buy it. I wish I could get my $80 back.

- I get crashes when trying to tune cars
- After almost every multi-player race I have to exit the game and restart
- It just overall feels very unstable and the ratio between the amount of time I get to play the game and restarting/waiting to get back into it is just unacceptable. 

I am running it on a decent PC with a i7 9700K and 7900XTX which you would think would run it OK. Although some issues could be related to AMD drivers, there are just too many issues I have encountered to chalk up the issues to ""AMD's Fault"". 

I do enjoy the game when it works, but starting to get frustrated as someone who doesn't have a lot of time to play it, when I want to sit down and play it for a couple of hours, I spend almost of third of that time just dealing with issues.

Update 1/25/24: The game seems to be more stable for the most part. I get the occasionally game crash or loading hangup. I have noticed that a lot of the wide body models appear broken on other cars in the lobby on multiplayer. There is also an issue with some bumpers on wide body cars being different colors. 

I do miss the ability to race any class on multiplayer whenever I wanted. Especially since leveling a car to get to certain classes takes FOREVER with the car xp system. I didn't mind it at first, but it's starting to feel like a grind just to then be able to use the car for a couple days and have to then start grinding on another car. 

Also, I miss the drift and drag racing lobbies. Maybe they plan to add those back in as updates (probably making people pay more for them) at some point, but still don't understand why they took them out.

I kind of understand the idea, but its very frustrating as it almost limits you to grind out a specific car when you would rather jump around and feel out other cars. Some cars are almost undriveable without certain upgrades and this limits enjoyment alot. I dont have issues with framerate or multiplayer (dont play it) as other people have seem to have had.

If you want to buy Forza Motorsport series i recommended to play Motorsport 7 but unfortunately you cannot play on steam but you can buy on his own store. Well i have several things to say why i really hate.

1ST Terrible physics and Horrible multiplayer rules:
Ok i admit it this game is realisting racing simulator but problem on this game is terrible physics game what is point to someone hit you not so much your vehicle spinning 360 and begin to losing your control during racing, Ai drivers are very oddly how exactly they drive. Problem is when you are 1st place on easy difficult you see your ai drivers how follows you instead to overtake, this glitch should be fixed on futher updates and they still aren't doing that, only to not say how game penalize several seconds for not reason what is point to opponent player hits your vehicle and game penalize for not reason i got several times althought i respecting racing rule i got scrabby penal becasue rude opponent player who is using constantly shorcut, leaps on your vechicle and hits you on purpose and you got penalty what is point to avoid to got penalty only because randomly fool break rules and i just got same amount second of penalty how like opponent player who loves to breaking racing rule and doesn't care to play game how actually he wants to play. Also to say how this online player on every each class using OP vehicle who's should to doing this to bring ban pick every vehicle on this game to be play properly  

2ND Upgrading vehicle:
What is point to spend your time to only play with Ai drivers only to leveling up you car to upgrading your vehicle. This is by me most hilarious thing who developer putting on his game. It's losing times to only to leveling up your car who can play   to be able to race with your lovely car.

3RD Cars lacking:
When i begin to play this game i spotted many cars lacks on car showcase. Yes i saw they saying before realising game how they bring 500 cars but many cars is just cars who is not like LMP cars or Random race designed cars. Yes you have LMP cars but they not much to bring like they bringing in previously motosport series even several manufacturer vehicles have only 1 car Example Alfa Romeo or Pagani. On last motosport series they bring atleast 7 Alfa Romeo or more like Pagani too but they bring only 1 Alfa Romeo same issue like happens in FH5 Car showcase either. I up of it and i know they bringing new vehicle on futher updates but again.

Don't buy this game if you want to Play Forza Motorsport just buy FM7 on MS. Is much better and funnier than this Franchise even is worse than Motosport 5 Launch i hope they will listen us to fix this game but still i doubt because this is 4TH update who they didn't touch anything i also to forgot to say how this game have terrible graphics but it don't mind me atleast to me but it's not problem of terrible graphic, problem it was because who iam hinted on my text what exactly is problem and what minds from me. [spoiler] I forgot to say how exactly this game have plenty glitches and how this game is terrible optimized althought pass over 60 Fps.",1696936934,1706221132,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

* Physics feel really good. You get a real feel for the weight and momentum of the car, especially during high-speed turns when you're at the limit of traction.

* The soundtrack is decent, although it lacks variety.

* No statistics at all. No history of races driven, number of wins, or anything really. 
* No map variety. No city map, no snowy map, no cool scenic map, but most importantly, there's still no Nordschleife.
* Poor graphics even at max settings. Most car models are just ported over from older games, and it shows. The interior views are especially lacking.
* No spectator mode.
* No auction house.
* No photo mode with scenic landscapes like Gran Turismo.
* No interesting challenges like the license tests of Gran Turismo. 
* The multiplayer penalty system is broken.

Multiplayer is broken. So so broken.

First of there's no match making to speak of. You will have a no lifer who's lapping 4 seconds faster than you and people who can barely keep it on the track in the same race.

Unless you are cutting corners the penalty system is non-existent. Taking a corner too fast and smashing into someone to slow yourself down is a very effective strategy. You come out ok. You are rarely if ever penalized and the other person usually ends up the wrong direction off the track. In the rare case you do get a penalty you are still in a better position than the person who you punted off.

The game claims to have a safety rating system. I have the achievement for consecutive races at top safety rating. It does no good.

If you piss someone off they will intentionally pit maneuver you. This is against the code of conduct and you can be banned for it. To file a report you need to submit a replay. Multiplayer replays are broken. They've never worked. They don't save. It's literally impossible to report people

This is another example of a game releasing unfinished and the shelf life will run out before the game is completed. I have no clue where to start with this.

""Game does not have enough content""
I somewhat agree with this criticism, I also think a lot of people just do not like time trials, custom races, or multiplayer. I would like to see something used again such as a career mode starting at D level cars and working up to S or R rank. Challenges or scenarios would be cool. Such as finish a lap in this amount of time or drift events (such as in Horizon) or rally events. I love rally so I am bias to it. As it stands the series modes are kind of lack luster and boring. Also - personal gripe. How am I supposed to get new cars for a series when it takes 10 hours to get enough money to get cars? 

Unreliable game-play.
This is a very demanding game to run, thankfully I have a beefy system. This game features monstrous frame drops, crashing problems, and loading problems. I asked support why I am having this problem and Xbox basically said you need more hamsters, or skill issue. How about instead of giving me a laundry list of issues it could be, you just optimize the game? This is not hard. 

""Game must be run on an SSD""
I understand technology is progressing and this is ultimately an Xbox game. It is unbelievably stupid for a game to punish those who do not have 135GB on their SSD. I ran mine on both HDD and SSD. While the game is on a hard drive, entire maps will not load. You will be driving on a grey void, if you choose to run a racing line not even that will not load. May be an issue with an update, but since I have had this game on the SSD I have more crashes. Just do what everyone else foes and optimize for a HDD and if you have a SSD it is a bonus. 

I will not gripe about the simulation or maps , cars, etc. Game has plenty of maps and cars. I really just wish that Turn 10 would take this game serious. As it stands, this will be a game that I frequently check on. I want to play this game, however with all the issues right now it is impossible. It has potential, I have also been patient and waited for the initial hate to pass in hopes of Xbox / Turn 10 buckling down and fixing this game. They likely never will and it is a shame.

2/5 go get a PS5 and play Gran Trismo if you want an ""Arcade like Racing Simulator"" or play Assetto Corsa (with mod manager) if you want a full  simulation.",1706113521,1706113521,False,21,1,0.520166873931884766,0,True,False,False

It's not hard to see why either. Blurry TAA (baked in so you can't even turn it off), bugs galore, out-of-date car models, zombie-like AI, bad optimization, stutters on certain tracks, unfair penalty system, lack of content (only 20 tracks at release with no Monza or Nordschleife.) Much of the game just feels mailed in, and as many others have stated, it does not look like the game we were shown in trailers leading up to its release. 

I've been playing Forza since the first game on the original XBox. I've put about 1000 hours into Forza 4 and, more recently, several hundred hours into FM7. I played this one for 20-ish hours on early release and it had enough flaws and annoyances that I put it down and hadn't touched it for the past week. Played it for a few minutes today just to see if my opinions had changed. They haven't, so back on the shelf it goes. This isn't to say the game doesn't have its positives, it does, but not enough to outweigh its negatives, at least not to me. 

Do yourself a favor and wait a couple months for them to patch the game's myriad of bugs and other issues before you spend your hard-earned money on this. 

Edit: After about a month since last playing, I have re-visited this game and I've spent a little over 3 hours playing it last night and this morning, and I am changing my review to recommended. For the most part, at least in single player which is what I play most, it has been smooth and enjoyable (4k/60fps on a 9900K and 3080). Racing has been nice and smooth, and none of the tracks I had issues with before have had any major hitching or stuttering in this latest re-visit. I dare even suggest it's now smoother around the track than FM7, and that's something I wasn't sure I'd ever hear myself say. I don't know if anyone at Turn10 will ever see this, but keep this up.

The biggest problem is with the graphics and efficiency of the game. The graphics of this game look worse in every single way that I can subjectively tell. You would think this would mean I could do high-framerates without issue, but the worse graphics are accompanied by worse framerates.

Forza 7 was nice because it was one of the few games that could take advantage of 4K 120fps with HDR, and look fabulous the entire time. In this game however I was only getting ~70fps in medium! After upgrading my GPU I saw only marginal framerate improvements, then I thought perhaps my new GPU isn't as good as I thought. Then I played other games where I went from 90fps in medium to 144fps (max with vsync) in ultra settings. There is a problem with this game, and for me this is enough to make is so that I cannot possibly recommend this game to someone looking for an eye-candy game like me.

Now the positives: Personally I enjoyed the car collecting and single player aspects of Forza 7, so the changes for this game are welcome additions that make the single-player experience more enjoyable. The car leveling is an interesting concept, and how it associates to upgrades. There are single-player events which appear to be rotating as well which is awesome! Everyone is docking the warm-up laps, but personally I think it makes it more realistic if a bit more tedious. The physics feels more accurate especially as changes are made to the car, its quite fun.

Overall this could be a great sequel to Forza 7 with a fun single-player experience, which is what I look for. The graphics issue destroys the entire experience though. If they are able to update this game so that I can experience the same level of beauty that Forza 7 delivers (not better, just the same), then it might be worth whatever price is being charged.

These boards communicate the actual distance from the turn. And it seems like the developers just kinda place them willy nilly where they though that they might look cool. I get that this game isn't a sim, but that type on information is critical when you are racing.

The more I play this game, the more and more glaring issues show themselves. I'm honestly don't think that i can ever recommend purchasing another Forza title to anyone in the future.

Firstly the car handling is awful, only 3 or 4 cars that I have driven, actually feel nice and don't under-steer all the time. This needs to be fixed asap.

Secondly, the upgrading system... Why would we need to spend hours just to be able to upgrade one car??? Then even if you do get the level well good luck with having enough cp (interesting choice for the name of the currency)

Thirdly, the career is really bad. There is no event that focuses on actual race cars as far as I am aware of. Its all just road cars which are a pain to drive.

And finally the fourth, many bugs are present on launch, and the game performs poorly even on a high end system like mine. The menus are really bad to navigate, should have chosen the menus from Horizon as they are very intuitive and easy to navigate. The penalty system is flawed especially considering it doesn't apply to the AI which rams you almost every race and ends up somehow penalising you instead?

On to the good things. 

The graphics are great and the cars sound nice. Rivals is fun to play and compete with other friends/players. Overall its a good game to compete online, at least until more single player content is added via monthly updates. Luckily this isnt an issue since Forza tends to update their games on a regular basis. The game is nice to play with a PS5 controller, yet to try it with a wheel but I will soon. 

Hoping that the devs fix these issues like they did with Horizon 5, but please, lets stop releasing unfinished/rushed games and only fix them a few months after launch day. It leaves a bad impression and is highly unprofessional. 

Until these issues are addressed my review will remain negative. If and when the game gets fixed my review will be positive and I will be inclined to update it.

So, with that said, what can I say that hasn't been said already?

The Good
----------
The game feels good to play. The physics are about right, the handling feels responsive and even on the controller gives good feedback. Changing tunes and parts actually feels like it impacts the way the car handles, accelerates, decelerates, etc...

The tuning menus are largely in the right place. Being able to swap tunes before a race is good. Being able to swap cars before a race is good if you have certain cars built for certain tracks (think Le Mans versus VIR). It would be better if you could swap entire builds for particular cars, though, instead of having to entirely switch cars.

I found myself easily able to use the sound of the tires and engine to determine if I was losing grip and when/if I needed to shift gears. So the sounds as far as indicating what is happening are pretty good.

The SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) system seemed to work OK for me. In most races, I found myself either middle of the pack, or in the top half of the pack. I never felt like I was being put in races where I was just getting crushed, or dominating. I always felt like my performance was due to my skill and not due to an unfair SBMM system.

The Bad
---------
Tuning. Oh man are cars difficult to tune. For a game that prides itself on being a ""simulator"" (though it's much closer to a simcade, as others have said) the tuning tools just aren't there. Where's the power graph for finding peak torque at an RPM? Why is the telemetry output via UDP missing critical information? I have yet to find a good way to tune camber using this output. Camber isn't present in the output, and tire heat is only output as total tire heat, not inner/middle/outer tire heat, which is useless for tuning camber. In order to properly tune a car, you need data! You need telemetry! And you need to graph it with respect to time! None of that is any good in this game.

Replays. This kind of factors into tuning as well. I decided that in order to get a good base tune on a car, I would simply drive it around the ""every track"" (Suzuka full) a few laps and then visit the replay. This works fine if you are only playing the replay forward. But.. it seems to me like the replays don't record actual telemetry and instead calculate the telemetry as the replay is played. Go ahead, run a car on a track in rivals or against AI and then visit the recording. Watch tire temps increase around a corner, then play it backwards. The tire temps actually go up further as the replay is played backward! Then if you play it forward, they go up even further! Like, what? This makes replays super difficult to use for tuning as well.

Career mode. Just thinking about having to race through that mode makes me physically ill. But I'll review it just because complaining about it is somewhat cathartic. You see, I used to be really big into Gran Turismo. And I remember the career mode from GT4 very well. When you start the game, you can go buy a used car you somewhat like, stick some better tires on it, maybe intake and exhaust, and immediately get into 3 or 4 different entry level races with it. When you win those, you can upgrade it, bring it to harder races. There was a genuine sense of progression there. You picked that car, you built it, learned it, raced it. You had ownership of it and could race that car through much of the game if you chose to do so. You could be the guy in the silver Honda City Turbo II trying to best actual race cars in the world championship if it tickled your fancy.

Not so in FMs career mode.

The career mode in FM is basically ""here is a linear series of races you have to race in a particular order, with only certain cars."" There's no ownership of the car you're racing. If I want to race, say, an AE86 in the practical performance series and build it up to be competitive, I can't do that. Why? Only certain cars are allowed in that series.  There are no ""open track day"" like events in career mode. No mixed platform events. If you want those events, you have to go race AI in Quick Event (or play MP, which is slowly dwindling in participants.) But then there's no progress there. It's just one off races after another. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the career mode in FM is boring and soulless. I ended up not even finishing it, and selling the cars I had to use in them because I didn't like them (which, btw, resets the progress of the career mode series associated with that car. What?)

The ""CarPG"" system. I'll be honest, when I first started playing this game, I thought it was a pretty neat system. It was cool to see the car going up levels, and wondering about which parts you'll get to upgrade the car.

That wore off fast.

Now it's an obstruction. It's a hindrance. If I want to experiment with different cars to see which ones I like better, which ones have the parts I want (wider tire sizes, body kits, aero options), I have to level it first. The game doesn't even let you inspect which parts might be available if you were to level up the car. It just gives you a message stating ""Car level needs to be xx to install this part."" The CarPG system needs to go away.

Probably about half of my time in this game was not me actively playing. It was me setting up on Suzuka with full assists to let the AI level my car so I could get the parts I wanted. All to avoid the CarPG system. Yuck.

The crew chief. She was cool when I first started playing, telling me about the tracks, letting me know I got a penalty because I punted into the shadow-realm the guy in front of me because I found the anime tattas on his car livery offensive. But as time went on, she became obsolete. As I got to know the UI, and where notifications were for things like current lap and penalties, she started to sound more naggy than helpful. ""You got a penalty, shame!"" ""This track has so much rubber on it you will have no problem with grip!"" And you know what, I had problems with grip! So not only is she annoying, she's a habitual liar. Joking aside, I just ignore her. I think what would make her more useful is telling you when your fuel level or tires need servicing and that you should pit next lap. Or that there's been an accident on the next corner. Things like that. She should be telling you about unusual events in the race.

Bugs
-----
I had a lot of issues with bugs early on. The game was virtually unplayable for me. But... lately it's been largely bug free for me. Not sure if I'm just lucky or what but the game has largely been very stable for me the last 50 or so hours I've played it. So I, anecdotally, can't complain too much about bugs.

Do I recommend this game in its current state?
-------------------------------------------------
No, I don't.

Give it some more time to mature and get it on sale. Forza Horizon 5 is more fun to race in and it's an arcade style game. At least in Horizon you can buy a car and then just use credits to upgrade it however you see fit, then go join a race in Horizon Online with that car instead of waiting, hoping, that this week or next will have an open spec event for the car you just built. ""Just put the car in the class that's available in open spec this week!"" you might say. To that I say, what if the car you happen to like is an '89 MR2? Or the '69 Nissan Fairlady Z 432? You're going to have a heck of a time racing those cars in R or P class with the available tire options.

For those of us looking for a more hardcore racing oriented game where we can tweak and tune cars we like and picked because we enjoy them, shaving off fractions of seconds on lap times and working our way up to a position on the podium, FM just isn't it right now.

I really hope they can turn this game around and make it as good as we're all hoping it can be. But we will have to wait and see...",1705601756,1705899178,False,7,0,0.508706629276275635,0,True,False,False

Please bear in mind this is just my experience with the game. If you enjoyed and can keep playing, all the power to you!

Okay, I'm a Gran Turismo fan but can't afford to buy a PS5 to play the latest game, so I thought to give Forza Motorsport a chance, to play it on my PC. Before buying it (this part is important), I made sure my PC met the minimum requirements for the game, by looking at the Steam chart specs and watching others on Youtube with my same setup playing without major issues. 

So I started playing the game on my PC, and the game played smoothly, most of the time. During my gameplay, I encountered a few bugs here and there, like disappearing cars or getting hit with a wall from the start of a race, but I did not pay much mind to it since I was enjoying the races in the career mode. Many people complained about the progression systems, the leveling, the late unlocks, etc. but I didn't pay attention to that because I just liked to go WHOOOOSH and win races. I even ignored the automatic penalty system being so weird.

But one day, the dreaded ""Update 3"" arrived, and suddenly my game wasn't playable any more. I mean, it didn't even open from the Steam launcher. It would crash, every time. So I spent days trying every solution from the official articles, scouting help forums, sent support tickets. Through my research, I found out 2 things: 1. I wasn't the only one, apparently it's an issue with my graphics card and DirectX 12, and 2. Turn10 won't fix it, since they basically told me, ""please update your PC to newer hardware"". What? You are telling me that your update broke compatibility with my PC, and I have to fix it?

It's outrageous.

And finally, I'm here. Leaving this bitter review out of frustration for not being able to play a game I actually enjoyed and had faith could just become better and better with time and effort.

I'll start with multiplayer since I spent most of my time doing that. First of all, the driver rating and the safety rating system is a myth. It's there for player retention and it doesn't matter if you have 1000 or 5000 DR. It doesn't matter if you have S or E SR. Driver stats page literally tells you that it will ""attempt to put you in a race with drivers that have similar ratings"" but it's a lie. At the moment my safety rating is S and my driver rating is 4980+. My level is 750ish. I shouldn't be matched up with level 19 drivers who literally have been playing the game for couple hours but nope. The game will put these drivers in your lobby anyway.

Why? Because the playerbase is dead, that's why. Just look at [url=https://steamdb.info/app/2440510/charts/]steamdb[/url] and you'll see what I mean. Obviously these stats don't include players playing on Xbox or gamepass but I doubt the worldwide player count is above 2000 players at this point. So why is the online aspect of this game dead then? It's because the game is riddled with game breaking bugs, performance issues, glitches and exploits. Looking at the rate turn 10 is addressing these issues, this game needs at least (and I'm being generous here) 2 more years in the oven. 4 big patches have been released since the launch and they haven't fixed any of the major issues like the pitstop exploit.

But the biggest issue is the penalty system and invisible drivers. I'll get to the penalty system but let me explain the invisible drivers issue first. There's a high probability that a driver in your lobby literally can't see your car. You can see their car but they can't see yours. So what happens when you have an incident with this driver then? You get yeeted off to oblivion while nothing happens to their car. Their car won't get affected one bit. I have tons of footage related to this issue and I even made a post on Turn10 forums. It took them a month to recognize the issue and move it to the known issues list (which is 50 pages long by the way). But you know what the best part is? The game thinks you caused the incident and it will penalize you. It sounds like a joke but this happened to me countless times.

How about the penalty system then? Hahah. Oh boy. Where to start... Let's say you're having a close battle with someone and you're faster than them. You try to find the gap but they won't let you pass by illegally defending. They finally mess up a corner and you get past them but they won't take that kindly, noooo (speaking from experience here). What happens next is that they ram into you at full speed as you break for a corner and send you off track. At this point, that driver should be disqualified immediately for murdering you and get slapped with E SR. But no. The game gives you (and I wish I was joking here) 2 seconds of penalty for ""going off track"". Meanwhile the guy who hit you gets a measly 0.50 seconds of penalty.

While I'm at it, let's talk about the reporting system. Let's say I want to report the driver in the example I just gave. The race ends, you find the driver you want to report in the leaderboard and hit ""Report Player"". The next step [b]should[/b] ask you why you want to report this player. You should pick the reason and boom. You're done. Do you know what happens instead? The game gives you a QR code. I kid you not. The game makes you scan a QR code with your phone. You unlock your phone, scan the QR code, expecting that all the information needed for a report to be there but no. The QR code literally leads you to turn 10's FAQ page and at the bottom, there's a link for reporting players. So you say ""okay fuck it, I'll see where this goes"". You sign in with your MS account first then you're greeted with this bigass form. It asks you the name of the driver, it wants you to upload footage, it wants replays (which are STILL BROKEN BY THE WAY) and so on.

This is literally the only game I know that shows a QR code when reporting players. They made the reporting system intentionally convoluted so you won't bother and they don't have to deal with player reports. Which leads to toxic drivers in multiplayer because there's no consequence to their actions. They won't get a penalty for intentionally ramming you off the road. They won't get disqualified. The worst thing that could happen is that their SR will go down a bit but that doesn't matter because it has no effect in matchmaking.

But you know what the funniest part is? Turn 10 put up a monthly post couple weeks ago saying that they will analyze ""pro drivers"" lobbies and fix the penalty system. Good, that's a start right? But then literally a day later, all the major leagues dropped forza motorsport because the game is unplayable due to the invisible drivers issue.

I wish all these issues were addressed before the launch but no. They decided to release the game in this state and they're very slow to fix the problems. Which is a shame because the physics are good. You can still be quite competitive even if you're playing with a controller. The weather effects are nice, and pit stop strategies give the game a bit of depth. The game is enjoyable [b]when it works[/b]. But in it's current state, it's not. I wouldn't recommend buying it. We gotta wait at least 2 years for these kinks to be ironed out and by that time, GT7 will be released on PC and it's gonna be too late for FM.",1701560495,1705838703,False,3,0,0.50640416145324707,0,True,False,False

I genuinely believe that the ""Safety Rating"" and ""Skill Rating"" mean nothing. I've been at least a consistent A Safety rank and at least a 4500+ skill rating, and I still get put into lobbies with controller-sucking toddlers.

I've written a good review for this and I've written a bad review for this. I've settled on this review which is ""good"" but it certainly could be better.

The driving is really good. Using a controller it is at least the equal of other driving games in this sub-genre and for me, feels much improved over 7, there is more nuance to the car control and more ways to influence where the car goes, it's satisfying, so that's good. I really value good controller ""feel"" because I cannot be bothered to set up a wheel most of the time. For me, the is the best feeling racing ""sim"" (ish) on pc using a controller. The driving is very good.

I quite like the car upgrade system which stops you from just buying up cars and slapping all the upgrades on without getting to know the car. Thing is, some people (and myself sometimes) would really like to just buy the car and slap all the upgrades on and this just isn't an option, and you'll have to do this with every car. You could look upon this as interesting progression or a massive inconvenience.

I'd like to see more variety in racing activities. The only single player races are the event ones, these take different cars over different tracks in a roughly 5 race series. All the races have the same practice session then race format and you get to choose your starting position for the race, it's never based on any series ranking, previous result or anything. There is no variation to this format in any of the races as of writing. Similar story for the multiplayer races follow the same format for scheduled races starting at a predetermined time.

The AI racers are pretty poor. They are seemingly sometimes more concerned with ruining your race that they are trying to win theirs. They'll sometimes brake on a straight or excessively brake on a corner if you're directly behind them to try and ""get you"" or something... it's crazy. The field spread in races is very extreme too, the leader will often clear everyone else easily, followed by 2nd - 4th or 5th and everyone else pretty far back falling over each other. You can't get a good pack race out of them either, if you're alongside they'll often just back way off and out of contention, they aren't good enough to race *with* the player in a satisfying or fun way. They are the worst AI opposition I've seen for a good few years.

Performance also does not really seem to be there, I couldn't really say the game runs very well. I play at 2560 x 1440, I have a 3060ti and a 5800X, more than enough to meet the Series X specs that this game runs on and it seems to struggle occasionally. I wouldn't say the game looks a lot better than Forza 7 either really. The minimum you could expect I suppose. To be fair though, the weather effects can look very good with great rain and mist/fog effects. When they combine with some early/late day low sun angle, they can look very striking.

Ultimately, there's not as much fun here as I had hoped to find after all the build up to the game's release. The functions for searching, sharing and showcasing liveries and their creators is sorely lacking, I can't even import my designs from the old Forza games as the feature is broken right now. The game is also very ""streamlined"" with no extra fun automotive fluff like you might find in other racing games like car washes, museums and photo modes outside of races. 

Turn 10 and MS (the publisher) talked a big talk in the lead up to this game and in my opinion it was not justified at all. 6 years in development? Ground breaking AI? I see no evidence of this.

But played in single player, just to drive around for an hour at a time? This is a good time. It's fine. Maybe they can make it better, but who knows.",1698279832,1705810053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't be fooled by how many hours played I have! I had this on Xbox and probably have 150+ hours on it if not more. I know, I know your say why the heck did you buy it on steam. Well, because Xbox suspended my account for 1 year lol lol lol! That and there no good racing games out right now in my opinion that are NEW! So I thought buying it on steam would fix the issue of Xbox not allowing me to play online. Because what's the point of even playing.........(and let's be honest, it's Forza Motorsport 7 remastered in a worse graphics engine) if you can't play online or even with your friends there zero reason to play this. I try to play rivals or free play and free play is a absolute joke by the way. Like wheres all the game modes from FM7? Why did you guys take out Open Track day? That was my favorite thing to do was play open track day. You customize your car and put a cool skin on it and show off and race people, have little car shows and meet ups on the side of the track. You BS with people over the headset it was great. But noooo, ""From the ground up"" they say! What you guy's meant I think was you guys did nothing for 7 years and last second Copy & Pasted FM7 and stripped it to the base level. 

Don't put a game out until it's finished! So many people are getting sick of broken and unfinished games coming out and you guys leaching just enough content every month to barely keep people here. Like there's 7 other FM games, why isn't every car from the other 7 games automatically in this game? Same with the tracks and game modes!!! Why do you guys have the camera angles for all your games since 2005? Change that stuff up man! Look at Gran Turismo 7. They have this awesome camera angle that's from the roof looking down at the hood. I love it. 

Ok, anyways back to why I bought it on steam even after my tantrum I just through lol. Because Xbox suspended me for a year so I can't play or talk to anyone online. So now I have Forza on Xbox and I can't even play it or the fun part of it anyway. So I thought if I got it on Steam I would be able to transfer my data over from Xbox since it's cross platform and be able to play online again with my friends. Well, imagine my anger to find out that Forza.net has also put a suspension on me for the year as well. So now I also bought it on Steam for no reason. Now keep in mind, I wasn't suspended from Forza from doing anything wrong it was with Xbox I had the issue. Apparently it's not a good idea when your filing an appeal with Xbox enforcement and you tell them exactly how you feel about them lol. I was originally filing for a months suspension but my mouth got me a year lol. Whatever, I sold the Xbox series X and that's the last time I buy and Xbox too. I also was a die hard Xbox fan. I had the original Xbox, 2 Xbox360's, Xbox one, Xbox one X and the Xbox Series X. Their loss! I'm the type of customer you don't want to lose I spend a lot of money! Yes, I have no life I know. So anyways, why Am I suspended with Forza as well? My driver rating was an high A rating online meaning I wasn't a dirty rammer or cheater and I never once spoke to anyone online. So I don't understand the ban from Forza at all.

What I can tell you is, if Forza doesn't lift the suspension on me for absolutely no reason at all, this was the last game I buy from them too!!!

The game plays fine and is a mostly enjoyable racing game at the end of the day, where you can (for the most part) tune your difficulty to the sweet spot that you like.

Right up until you receive a cryptic ""Enforcement Warning"" saying in game that further infractions will result in a ban, which contains no details of what the warning is for or how to find out more. When you spend a bit of time searching and find that you can log in to forza.net to see details, even that doesn't really provide anything of value (mine was about running cheating software when I'm absolutely certain I wasn't).

If you reach out to support asking for details, they'll give you a canned response about how they scan your PC for ""unauthorized hardware or software that enables cheating or tampering"", and that running them at the same time at the game can result in a suspension. Then they'll break into how they appreciate your passion and the time you took to submit an appeal, but they can't lift a suspension once it's been enacted.

Wait, what? You asked about a cryptic warning you received in game. Where the hell did this language about suspensions come from?

Sometimes the fuel calculator decides to not work and you run out of fuel half way through an online race.
Races are unbalanced due to poor matching making and there are usually a limited number of people with fully upgraded cars.
You will get rammed off the track by others players, and if they go off the track first, you will get a penalty for it. The penalty system seems to only be aware of what happened after the incident, and not what happened before.
You can't tune your car during Rivals but you can during other races, even though it says that tuning will invalidate your lap at the start of Rivals.
You have to level up cars before you can even tell if they are competitive or if they can reach the PI that you want, since you can't see upgrades until you level up. Want to drive the Mazda 787B? It can't even get close to max PI in any class and it's completely useless.
The leveling system is pointless time sink that adds nothing to the game. This is why people are running up their power bills driving cars by themselves overnight to level them.
The AI drivers will often ram you off the road and ignore you are there. They will randomly brake on straights and through flat out turns.
There is nothing you can do with drag tires or drift suspension.

-Car Selection
-Track Selection
-Driving Experience
-Camera Immersion
-Car Sounds

Unfortunately the game continues to be bare in features, game even lacks stats towards personal achievements and  from cars owned. Layout still looks like something out of 2010. Most bugs have been fixed, but the gameplay continues to be disappointing.

LEVELING UP:
A very annoying feature that prevents you from getting better parts early on. The way it works: the more you drive the car, parts will unlock to be used with credits earned while driving (not money earned). Once you hit top level 50 then you get an additional 5% discount for cars from same manufacturer.


CAREER MODE:
Very boring.
Every race is just a few laps.
There's no qualifying, so you can pretty much choose which position you want to start.
Fuel and Tire management is useless since races are short there's no pitting.
AI is dumb as a rock. they T-Bone you whenever they have a chance.
You can also choose the level of difficulty, so every race is achievable with no challenge whatsoever.


MULTIPLAYER:
My biggest gripe.
So much time wasted towards ""Practice"". I just want to qualify and race. Having to wait 30 minutes for a race to start is just an insane amount of time!
Only about 5 or 6 choices of events at a time to race specific cars in your inventory. Basically it leaves using your other cars only on boring Rivals and Career Mode. So if you want to race online with that beautiful Ferrari you just bought, too bad, unless there's a race for it, it'll collect dust in your garage. Private servers would be your only choice if you have friends online.
Penalties is a joke, people have already figured out how to play bumper cars and get away with it.

Road disappearing completely, I mean actually disappearing so that you see the void underneath as if the texture is no longer there, and you are still driving on the surface of what was visibly a road. Some artifacting on shadows, surfaces and even the sun beams have artifacted into my face. Very disorientating. Manual+clutch still feels sticky but it is workable, by no means a simulated experience because why would you have some one with a wheel set up be slower than using a controller? Their ""advanced ai"" are no more than children told to drive real fast, they'll slam into you for no reason, run you off the track... Overall a garbage experience there. Similar to online, really. Only difference is in solo, you are playing a fair field. Online though, if you haven't grinded out your car levels, you'll be matched with players who have properly maxed their cars and be easily left behind 20+ seconds, even if you drive the line perfectly. I know because I maxed out my car(s) before going in and stomped all the stock cars... which would just ram you at their first chance they got. Haven't been able to play a proper race with damage, fuel and tires on because it doesn't feel like anyone wants to play it that way. Go back to FH5, that is the arcade experience you are looking for.

All in all, the game is quarter-baked for a premium price and it definitely shows. Execs should have kept it from the public for another year.

Edit: Patch 1.1 only fixed one or two instances of infinite loading/saving. Still experiencing such in other various scenarios. FPS is better overall, though.

Edit 2: Attempted a long race (100 laps on le man) only got through 60ish laps before the game began to stutter and chop immensely. I know it was the game as this is on a fresh install of windows 11, my hardware is much more than adequate for what graphics settings I was running it on. Thankfully didn't have any issues before this. However, at around lap 88, things began getting really choppy and slow before I received a blue screen of death. All hardware is known working without any issues or over heating problems (memtest and other monitoring programs tell me so) It was meant to be an endurance test of my abilities and the update they released. If I could downvote further than simply saying no, I would. Even though I received this for free, I wish I could receive a refund any way.

Edit 3: November 14th, 2023; Patch seems to have fixed several complaints that I had with the game, namely not being able to run at native aspect ratio/resolution (32:9 5120x1440) and frame rate has been improved (capped 120fps) However, cut scenes are now quite choppy some times. Not a huge deal.

Edit 4: Game is still technically trash but considering how many people are still experiencing issues... I can tell you this: Probably your pc. The last few updates actually did fix a ton of stuff wrong but what fixed everything else for me was identifying there are software issues within Windows. So, perhaps it is actually your fault and not the devs'.

I've got disappearing road every once in a while, forcing me to restart the event.

lot of cars don't look like a 2023 game. Take the old BMWs, and just admire the poor sad empty headlights...
bad lighting when you pick your rims, and you can't even rotate the car..
AI will ram you even more than humans will, and once you pass them, they just let you go upfront, never battle

Is it an eSports racing sim champion? no, but I'm not one of those people either (I tend to play full regulation rule set, and so far I'm a 5 on the AI level). It has been great so far. I'm a huge fan of F1 racing and I play Redout 2 here and there so Forza seems mega slow in comparison, but it should, and as I work up the levels it will get faster I'm sure. 

As for content. Yeah I paid for the $100 premium edition. Yeah they are holding back tracks, cars, etc. Whatever, iRacing makes you pay by the month, by the car, and by the track and can easily cost you way more than $100. B*tch on people, but I have a feeling this will get me plenty of value over time. I'm not a churn and burn type gamer anyhow so I'll get my value out of it. 

I also like that this game is all about track racing. I have played the Horizons and I'm finally glad to have a real Forza game again where half of the content isn't driving through the bushes or rally racing. As long as that is your jam, and it boots, I think you will have a good time.

With all of that said. There are a lot of annoying bugs. It is clear the Forza team lacks testers, or if they have them, they lack good ones. No offense QA team, maybe you have even reported these and the devs aren't working on fixing them, and if that is the case the Devs (and probably the managers that prioritize the work) need to take a break from pushing content and fix a few things. Here are my most annoying ones to date and ones I wish were fixed soon (in order of priority)

1. It doesn't remember that I'm using a custom input type. Every time I start the game I have to go to settings. Switch over to input types, change it to a custom setup (for my wheel), save it again. Prompted if I want to save, ""yes"". Repeat every time I start the game. EVERY TIME. Look my wheel is there. Select the settings already on boot.

2. ""Free Play"" is broken. You get two picks ""Advanced"" or ""Quick"" the only difference is the amount of settings you get to modify out of the gate. So pick your favorites, go race, when the race gets done it will autopick the next race for you... USING THE DEFAULT SETTINGS! Not the settings you setup for the first race. So then you exit back to the main menu, go into Free play again, setup the next race right, get one race in, and then repeat. Endlessly. It is clear no one bothered playing the game for fun over the long term, after modifying settings. So broken!

3. about 25% of the time after I finish a qualifying race the game will go to the load screen to show my car driving into the pits... it never exits that load screen. Kill entire app, start it again (if I want to see it load the shaders again for 5 minutes), repeat at bug #1.

4. My favorite (but not as annoying as the first three), finally start a race, it gives me the count down but before the countdown ends, the 'autodriver' hits a wall, damaging the car, having to force me to pit before I can even do the first lap.  This happens maybe 5% of the time I start a Test Drive in Free play in the cars I actually want to drive. I'm keeping a list of these and after I get a few I'll submit a report of these instances as well.

So those are my top 4 bugs. All still existing as of this writing (I submitted the top three to their support ticketing system, we will see if they get fixed). They all combine to make a really horrible experience. Look I just want to quickly race a few times before work or bed. I hate fighting with your game every time I play it.

I would not recommend it. It's another unfinished game on the market in like the worst time for games, where almost every title is a mess at release. It's the year 2023 and this game puts most load on the first CPU core like in old DX11 games. Fix your mess.

Edit: Now after some more time i also have to say, the upgrade system of the cars is like the worst they could have done to the game, it removes all the fun from the game. You need to earn Carpoints to level up your Carlevel to be able to buy car parts with your Carpoints. That means if you want to upgrade a car to the max, you have to spend 2-8 hours just so you can install all parts you want. So that is 1000-4000 hours to max out all 500 cars. The person that came up with this idea needs to get fired. This nonsense has to be removed from the game. We should be able to buy car parts with the ingame credits like in previous games and the carlevel has to be removed too.

Just don't buy this game, believe me it's nothing but a grinding hell.

Edit2: I made a little list of pros and cons.

Cons:
Horrible carPG system (system has to be removed, it’s self explanatory)
Horrible CPU performance on PC (doesn’t take advantage of multithreading & is single threaded)
Horrible Sound (Transmission is too loud, and it sounds like you are in a tunnel, if next to tiny wall)
Horrible AI (self explanatory)
Horrible menus, hud and other things
Horrible career mode it’s like there isn’t a career mode
Horrible long loadtimes if downloading tunings & liveries
Game is unstable
Same car models from years ago
Not enough race tracks
Can’t switch transmission from 5 gears to 6 gears or 8 gears to 6 gears etc.
As far as i can tell more downforce doesn’t make cornering better it’s like it only makes cars slower
There are no real water puddles so no real aquaplaning anymore like in FM7
Multiplayer is a wreckfest


Pros:
In general the game looks good
The dynamic weather is halfway decent (but no water puddles anymore…)
The dynamic day & night is great
The car physics is at least halfway decent
The car selection is okay
Damage model is halfway decent


There are more cons than pros that is for sure. In it’s current state i would rate it 3.5/10 or 4/10 not any better. The game is playable sure, but not very enjoyable. it feels more like a chore if playing the game, a game shouldn’t feel like a chore.",1697028026,1705412680,False,6,1,0.511094808578491211,1,True,False,False

-80% of cars bought or acquired cant be used in career mode
-multiplayer has minimal selection and like career you cant use majority of the cars you acquire
-car crash physics look worse than FM 1 & 2
-red lining car does nothing to hurt the engine (but it did in FM 1/2 lol)

This isn't really it but it comes close enough to scratch my itch.
I read a lot of reviews about it being unplayable on PC and it seems to be a coin toss if you are going to experience issues or not. I am lucky enough so far to not be experiencing any game breaking issues.

That being said... Performance is all over the place. The framerate on some tracks vary wildly with some sections getting a solid 90fps on my rig while others get 40fps. That's probably my main gripe.

My 2nd biggest gripe are the AI drivers are truly awful even when you set the difficult to maximum. At max difficulty, there will be 3-4 fast drivers at the front and everyone else will lag behind pretty substantially. On top of that, the AI will straight up RAM YOU OFF THE TRACK. This is not a one off scenario for me. They also don't give a SHIT if you have them on the inside or not. They WILL turn into you.

Other than those two things I have had a solid experience so far. The upgrades are engaging enough for me and the cars and tracks are beautiful.

Original Review
Outside of release performance that it seems some people are having - this game is fun
Upgrade system needs work, and the proximity arrows feel outdated, Single player ai seems scuffed (good pace when driving alone but scuffed when racing a a pack)

I categorically refuse to play multiplayer solely because of how cancerous every lobby is. Unless you really like free play/rivals, there's really nothing left to do once you finish the single player tours. It's got exactly the same problem as Horizon 4 and 5, where the game gets very boring very quickly when you finish all of the main content. I told myself I'd give it a few months to see if the updates made the experience any better, but now that Turn 10 has announced the most lackluster update I've ever seen, I really don't have any reasons left to continue playing. I might give it another chance when/if the Nordschliefe finally gets released. All I'm waiting for beyond that is for TDU Solar Crown to come out so I can finally drop this dog shit studio for good.

I played Forza Motorsport 4 religiously when it first came out, and it maintains a place in my heart as one of the best racing games of all time. Playing this new game fills my heart with sadness at times gone by, because I can say with 100% honesty that this game doesn't hold a candle to Forza 4, one could also say that it's a noticeable downgrade from Forza 7. 

The racing is fine (except the blind AI that have rammed me off the road on numerous occasions). The cars feel decently weighty and the handling is fairly engaging, like I'd expect from a Forza game. It does feel a little dead to me, but I'm a masochist who plays Assetto Corsa with a gamepad, so take that for what you will. The sounds are decent too, save for some engine oddities like the Sauber C9 sounding almost nothing like the actual car and the slightest of bumps between cars sounding like being hit by a truck full force. The circuits are fine too (barring no Nordschleife on release), but the inclusion of a fictional track in Hakone is a bit confusing to me. Hakone isn't too far from where I call home, and I would have loved to see some of the actual roads in the area modeled in-game as they'd make for wonderful free drive or 1v1 race tracks. Hell, there's even a real racetrack in the area, Fuji Speedway, that could have been modeled. Twisty mountain roads aren't new for Forza Motorsport games either, just ask all the people who are begging for Fujimi Kaido from Forza 4 to come back.

The cars, frankly are nothing new for Forza, save for the Cadillac LMP car and a few new-ish road cars. Everything else is just a rehash of cars from older Forza games (and that ""from the ground up"" business is an outright lie, some of the models for cars in this game are grossly outdated, like the S15 Silvia and Evo 6). Not really much to say on that front beyond that. The fact that the only F1 cars you get are from before 1995 and that other racing disciplines like NASCAR and Indy are completely absent is not lost on me either. This whole situation stinks of ""recycling cars as paid DLC and calling them new"" syndrome that Turn 10 has been so awful with in recent years.

Graphically, the game looks pretty good. That's really all I can say about it. It's very nice to look at, but it's not breaking any new ground graphic-wise. It does have ray-tracing enabled 100% of the time, which does give it a leg up over Gran Turismo 7, but that's really the only advantage I can think of. It runs okay-ish on my hardware, save for some cutscenes lagging like a bad host in a Call of Duty lobby. I'm using an i9 paired with a 4080, so I can absolutely see why people who aren't running the latest and greatest would be having trouble with this game's performance.

The soundtrack is as close to non-existent as you can get, which is a crying shame. Forza's soundtracks have taken a huge step backwards in the last 10 years, to the point where I would outright mute the soundtracks in Forza 6 and 7 and either play my own music in a separate window or just race in silence, which is what you do in this game anyway since there is no soundtrack when you're actually racing. At the very least, the menu soundtracks are unobtrusive, but they're also completely forgettable. Spend an hour playing Forza 4, then spend an hour playing this game, and you'll see what I mean.

The career mode and progression system is a joke. Not a single racecar in the career mode, and car-specific XP being required to earn upgrade parts makes this game an absolute slog to play through. Not to mention that an internet connection is required to play the single player career, which I find absolutely ridiculous. Even the F1 games managed by EA of all companies are playable offline.

Concerning the bugs on release, I'm astounded that this game released in such a barely functional state. The game crashed out completely after finishing my first race, and while I would love to play more to get more experience for this review, it won't even start now. You could make the argument that Horizon 5 was just as broken on release, but that was also completely unacceptable, and I find it astounding that Turn 10 have learned absolutely nothing from this.

Overall, this game is a gorgeous, barely functioning shell of what Forza used to be. It's completely soulless, and I can't pin down if this is because of corporate intervention from Microsoft or if Turn 10 have just gotten complacent and lazy from the lack of competition in the genre. ""Built from the ground up"" is an absolute lie, this game just feels like a rehash of the last few Motorsport games. I've spent the last decade or so pining for a game that can capture my attention like the older Motorsport games, only to receive mediocre game after mediocre game. Maybe that's partly my fault since I got so attached to Forza 4 in my younger years. If this is your first Motorsport game, give it a whirl, I'm sure you'll like it.

So here I am. a hundred plus hours into the game and I'm glad I came back.

All-in-all, if you're a fan of sim racing and Forza in general, then I highly recommend the game.
Career mode is a long haul but well thought out. Frustrating at times but the whole idea was to level up your cars gradually as well as your driver level.
Online racing is awesome. Particularly if you're a fan of classes E to A. Makes for some fun racing. Higher level is equally as fun but a little less forgiving.

[h1]Update 1/12/24[/h1]

I can't... I just can't.  I tried.  I'm going to set it down until the next update.  Hopefully Turn 10 gets off their laurels and addresses actual game issues instead of kicking out more cars and other DLC.   I don't play online, but with the AI cars, I just can't take any more ramming, slamming, and PIT maneuvers against me, and then being penalized on top of being slowed by the collision.   The only thing I will play for now are solo races for timed laps.  All the issues in the original review below remain, making the game nearly un-playable for me.

[h1]Update 1/5/24[/h1]

Okay, here we go again... Tried to give the game some more time (that's mostly because it's by far the newest racing game I have for my computer.  Assetto Corsa is good, but just feels so dated at this point.  I want to like this game.  I really do.  It feels and looks pretty good when driving, but the same things that really bug me continue to do so.

One thing I have noted is that the car level mechanic seems completely pointless.  Just adding a bit of a grind mechanic to a game that doesn't need it, and I don't understand exactly how it determines to award you points.  Several times, I have gone off road only to be awarded a car level once I get back on the track.  Awarding poor driving?  Not to mention that it only takes a couple races to level up your car fully.

Final note.  No Nordshleife on launch?  Seriously? Lame.

Here are some of my favorite moments over the last week:

-AI slamming me off the road and me getting penalized for it. This results in lots of first-lap race restarts, reminding me how much time this game makes you spend in the menus (see rant below about this).  

-The solo career race pausing because my internet connection dropped.  By the time it reconnected, I forgot where I was in the race... I was in the braking zone after a straight.  So this caused me to miss the turn and go off-road.  Thankfully, this did not cause me to lose my place and no race penalty, but reminds me how much I HATE when games force the SINGLE PLAYER career mode to have internet connection.

I am going to take a break from this game because of these frustrations, and give Asetto Corsa another go.  We'll see if it being dated is enough to drive me back to Forza.

[h1]Update 12/26/23[/h1]

Felt like driving today, so I fired up Forza again... Well, I tried to, but it had updated and didn't launch.  Yay.  After I spent an hour and for some reason it only launches if steam is in offline mode (why on earth?).  Why is this the ONLY game on steam I ever have problems launching?  Anyway, after wasting most of my play time trying to get the game to run at all, I was reminded about all of my gripes in my original review below.  Loading takes forever.  So many menus just to start a race.  And god forbid you restart a race.  I do.  A lot.  Save the non-productive insults about skills for someone else.  But I was reminded how frustrating it can be if you restart a race or practice a few times.  Restart race doesn't mean restart race.  It means let us take you back to the race menu and make you go through several menus, load screens and cut-scenes instead of just going back to the starting point.  I'm starting to think they are more proud of the menus and load screens than the game itself.  Which is a shame because the actual game play is pretty good.  I just spend more of my time trying to get the game to launch, loading, and in menus, than getting to play it.

===================================================================================
Original:

If you like absurdly long load times, spending more time in menus than playing, unnecessary cut scenes, and AI that treats you like a bumper car, then this game is for you.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
-Once you get past all the menus an loading, and are actually in the car, the game looks pretty nice and the physics feel pretty good so far.  Sound quality on the few cars I've driven is mostly good.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

[b]Load Times:[/b] The initial load time, and each initial race menu load take what feels like forever.  Realistically, it is about a minute and a half on a laptop with an AMD Ryzen 9 5980X, 32GB DDR4 3200MHz, and a Radeon 6800M 12GB.  Not a beast of a machine, but also no slouch.

[b]Menus:[/b] This game seems to have just too many menu screens to do anything.  For example, if you crash or mess up in a race and want to restart it, instead of simply restarting the race, it brings you back to the race menu where you get to repeat all of the selections over again.  Plus you get to watch all the little unnecessary cut-scenes again.  It's 7 selections and 4 menu screens just to restart a race.  It's a similar number of menus and presses just to start a race as well. 

[b]Cut-scenes:[/b] They seem to want the game to be very cinematic, and there are tons of little cut-scenes in the game, such as the driver walking to the car, or pulling into the pits after a race.  The first time you see them, they are okay.  After the 50th time, I wanted to scream at the game to just let me play.

[b]AI:[/b] So far, my experience with the AI drivers in the game has been frustrating.  They make absolutely no effort to avoid you (seeming to ram you on purpose in turns), and in a few cases, swerved into my car when we were side-by-side going down a straight.

[b]No offline career:[/b] Pretty self-explanatory.  You must be online to play in single-player career mode.  I hate when games do this.  Many people scoff at this complaint, but there are still people in the world that don't have high-speed internet all the time.

[b]Game Crashes:[/b] My initial experience with the game was a crash every time I attempted to start career mode.  It would crash while loading the first race of the builder's cup, while showing the narration screen that has nothing on the screen but a picture of a car and some text, with the narrator explaining practice mode.  I was eventually able to fix this by turning off ray tracing, which makes no sense.",1701603262,1705093107,False,14,0,0.590876758098602295,0,True,False,False

This bug has been know about since Forza 4. The AI will randomly decide to ram you (giving YOU a time penalty), brake on a straightaway, and drives as if you don't exist in the corners. Too bad because physics and feel of the cars are actually quite nice... AI is also completely useless at the start of a race. The graphics have an odd fuzzy look to them, especially in menus. (less noticeable when in a race) When you get into the slipstream of another car on a straight, you get an absurd speed boost that rockets you forward. The progression system requires you to slowly grind each car's level up in order to put any upgrades on it with car points instead of letting you just use your money. The 'story mode' is boring, and the choices for the categories of cars used are lame. No LM, F1, GT, or hardly any race car races, despite those cars being in the game. Why buy the car pass or DLC if there is no way to use it? (aside from  from the car-torpedo-fest that is online) This was a money grab that probably could have been a decent game if the people behind it cared to make it that. There is a massive lack of content which could easily be fixed. As a long time fan of Forza games, this will probably be my last.",1698695009,1705092336,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit (Jan. 12th 2024):
Nurburgring long distance race with the McLaren F1 GTR... Round 23... Tarmac disappears at night time with rain... THANK YOU!!! (NOT!)

Edit (Jan. 3rd 2024):
some months passed by and from time to time I gave this game a try. May be some updates did some good stuff to it.

So...
Maybe the shader doesn't have to be rendered every time the game starts, the AI seemingly became a bit smarter and the track does not disappear in every single race but...

- this does not mean the tarmac stopped disappearing completely. Especially not in the final lap!!!!

- The game can't remember my controler selection, so I have to switch everytime I start the game, otherwise I can't shift gears...

- I can clamp my wheel down in a bench vice and the in-game-steering-wheel still wobbles around the center. It feels to me like this wobble causes the car to rock up when I'm on the edge to lose control and try to calm the car down.(obviously this game is optimized for consoles)

- I have to stick-shift cars with sequencial shifters (including pressing the clutch) because there's no differenciation for the settings (which don't get pre-selected at startup).

- The Breaking-System is absolute garbage. When pushing the break-pedal more than a quarter inch (~6mm) the wheels will block and you'll understeer out of every corner.

- There's no setting for car-specifically available driving aids. You can have 'em or not. What I want is cars without ABS cannot have ABS activated, except you equipped the car with ABS in the tuning section etc.

- AND WHAT TF IS THIS TUNING SECTION?
Car Points? Where am I? Clown World? This has nothing to do with realism! And realism was my main argument to buy this game. This is a damn Mario Kart clone!

[h1]“BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP”[/h1]

Build from the ground up this, built from the ground up that.... It was by far the most stressed quote during Forza Motorsport’s marketing. Here’s what’s improved: 

[list]
[*]- Massively improved physics & handling model, including 8-point contacts for tires with 360hz update rate & better wheel support
[*]- Fuel & Tire Strategy
[*]- A new penalty system (which sometimes punishes the rammed instead of rammers)
[*]- Challenge the grid for singleplayer, where you can choose the starting position before a race.
[*]- Improved multiplayer with practice laps, qualifiers, Safety & Skill rating, spec races where everyone drives the same featured car with same upgrades & tuning.
[*]- Skip lap in Rivals
[*]- FOV slider for PC & XBOX
[*]- And more…
[/list]

And here are what's not:

[list]
[*]- Over 450 cars missing from Forza 7. I guess they're gonna reintroduce them as ""new content"" for their live service
[*]- Always online for single player. If the servers have issues then no one will be able to play the game. Plus, by doing this, Turn10 has put an invisible expiration date to their game. If one day Microsoft decides to shut down the servers, your game is unplayable. 
[*]- Forced 60 FPS lock in multiplayer. It’s 2023 & physics are still being tied to framerate. Not even the biggest esports like CS, Valorant, R6, League dares to force FPS lock for everyone.
[*]- No drift events, No Drag racing.
[*]- Many outdated car models that hasn’t been updated since original Xbox/360 games.
[*]- 360 degrees cockpit wheel turn.
[*]- No drift tires
[*]- No rear wheel steering
[*]- No Auction House
[*]- No digital speedometer. Only option is Analog
[*]- Missing car color customization options
[*]- And more…
[/list]

[h1]HORRIBLE PERFORMANCE, BUGS & GLITCHES EVERYWHERE[/h1]

My RTX 3060 laptop is struggling to maintain a stable 60 FPS even on lowest setting with DLSS on quality, meanwhile this mid-tier laptop has no problem getting 120+ FPS on the same lowest setting with no frame drops or stutters in FH5. And it’s not just my issue. People have been posting images where their RTX 4090 even fails to reach 40 FPS. 

Even if I pretended that the game is well optimized & this is the max performance my laptop could produce, it’s still unacceptable. Not everyone has access to a RTX4090 & I9-13900K, and they shouldn’t cause even the mid-tier PCs to suffer even on lowest settings, just to make their game 10% more beautiful like Starfield. Remember, “diminishing returns” exists.

Visit [url=support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/21456702310931-Known-Issues-Forza-Motorsport]Turn10’s official known issues list[/url], you’ll be stunned with the incredibly long list of issues. From the buggy replay system, infinite loading screen, to career mode not saving progress, people have been posting bugs & glitches everywhere on social media for the last few days. It makes me beg a question: What the hell have they been doing during the last 6 years? Where’s quality control?

[h1]WHO ASKED FOR CAR LEVELING?[/h1]

Forza players have been asking for better career progression for years. They want to start with low-level/economy cars then slowly work towards high-end hypercars. Instead of that, Turn 10 gave us a Call of Duty-esque CarPG progression, Where instead of buying upgrades with credits, you have to level up to earn Car Points for upgrades. It’s a very controversial system. Some like it, while many others (including me) don’t.

Here's the good:
[list]
[*]- You can reset upgrades without credit cost, and all car points are refunded when resetting upgrades.
[*]- It frees the headache of making finacial decisions between upgrading a car & buying a new one. 
[/list]

 So why is it bad?

[list]
[*]- The new progression system does not give what players want. They asked for zero-to-hero type of progression, and this system fails to deliver that. Everyone can just buy a hypercar from the start if they have enough in-game credits. Heck, high-end cars are now much cheaper than before (highest ~500K credits).
[*]- It’s repetitive. All upgrades’ unlock requirements are the same for 500+ cars.
[*]- Once a car reaches level 50, you earn no progress towards upgrades. Now you have to make a decision between leveling up a different stock car, or stick with your max level cars.
[*]- It straight up discourages players from trying different cars. Why bother spending 4-6 hours leveling a car just to find it not as good as others, when you can just max level a meta car & stick with it instead?
[*]- It hurts tuners & photographers a lot. Their fun is all about customizing cars, and having to spend 3-5 hours leveling a car before being able to tinker around with it isn’t fun. Now repeat the same routine for 500+ cars…. Ugh.
[*]- Since the time investment for leveling cars is enormous, hosting private races & tournaments is much more difficult now. Players will face major disadvantages if their cars aren’t levelled up, and It’ll be a nightmare for organizers to test a lot of cars in order to create proper rules & restrictions.
[/list]

CarPG must've been made not to be fun & engaging, but with the sole intention to please investors by having players always repeating the same grind and prolonging the player numbers, hours played or whatever metric they aim for to present it to their investors.

[h1]AN EXAMPLE OF BAD LIVE SERVICE GAMES[/h1]

Forza Motorsport is literally a great example of bad live-service games: release an early access buggy mess that meets the bare minimum of being playable, then improve it later with updates. While the core gameplay is still intact & incredibly fun, almost everything else is half-baked. It’s like a gem covered in stinky poo poo, when the owner doesn't respect its value. I recommend not giving them money & not pampering them for just passing the bare minimum, but instead buying this game 1 year later while on a sale, when the game is fixed.

Forza have had a long-lasting game series where the games brought enjoyment for the Motorsport fans. 
I've played all Forza games since FM 2 including all horizon games and really enjoyed most of them. When I heard that they where releasing a new Motorsport that was built from the ground up i got very excited what they would bring us.  After playing the latest Horizon games i built up an expectation on what the customization, car experience and car variation would be like.

[h3] Release day [/h3]

As a true fan I of course went for the full premium game and got the early release gameplay. After almost 50 hours of gaming all my excitement was gone and i was left feeling empty. All the expectations and thrills I've had  for the older games couldn't be found while playing this one. I don't even know where to begin, the problems are way to many. 

Here is a ""short"" list of whats wrong:

Poor handling, many fps drops, graphical bugs, poor camera view, missing road texture, car colors looking dull.

There must have been literately no testing at all of this game since it contain so many non hidden bugs.

Ai being all over the place, crashing into you and creating an bad experience in the single player.

The Single player career is missing a lot of content, lacking of maps, lacking of some race classes and no 25 lap races. No feeling of actual progress.

The carpoint system is a good idea but lacks understanding of what makes Forza fun, the grind takes way too long and it doesn't make sense to make u do it all over again if you want to customize the same car. 

The camera is fixed while changing wheels or other parts which makes the whole experience of customization of the car you worked so hard for feel awful. 

The whole menu feels awkward and soulless. Having a fixed car in the menu is probably the worst thing with the menu atm. 

No new stickers for the paint options. Neither no new paints.

NO WHEEL SPACERS, no turbo lag option, Car parts prices makes no sense.

No skipping of practice before you start a race.

Car prices makes no sense, i get the idea of making all cars financially available but it isn't done in a good way.

There is no feeling of actually ""winning"" something. The long asked career where u start with a golf polo and fight your way up to the Le mans cars is none existing.

Forza Motorsport 2 had a transparent car for the ones u haven't unlocked yet which made us actually wanna progress in the career and do all the long endurance races just to unlock some of the rarer cars.

The music, Motorsport 2-4 was peak menu music and overall aesthetic of having a good sound to it.

[h2] The good parts? [/h2]

The multiplayer is where this game shines, as long as no one crashes into you and gives you a 2-second penalty for being in THEIR way.

The intro for the series is a nice touch.

All new hoods and body parts is a nice addition to the cars that were missing parts.

The car list is OK.

The new maps are done well and have a nice feeling to them.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

Dont buy this game, wait until its fixed. This game has the foundation for a great game but nothing is certain until its proven.

Turn10, please listen to your fan base. Look at what worked in the older games, what we as the customers want and what made your games desirable. As a hardcore Forza fan this is my official last game i will ever buy from you, you made a lot of fans disappointed and will have a lot to make up to in the future coming updates/games.",1705051431,1705051431,False,115,2,0.835855841636657715,5,True,False,False

The core racing aspects, which are largely the same as Forza Horizon but leaning slightly more to simulation racing, are quite fun, but the issues lie primarily in the game's progression system. The format of having the player stick with one car over the course of a racing series that levels up and unlocks new parts is a good idea for easing players into car building and getting them used to particular cars. This system persists without change throughout the campaign and in time-limited events, however, and every car you drive starts at level one and progresses at roughly the same rate. This makes for a rather repetitive play experience and one that sometimes feels like it's asking for a much bigger time investment than the average player will be able to put in.

   This game is mindless corporate trash that costs more money with less content than previous installments from 15 years ago. ""Built from the ground up"" is a cover statement, and also false. The engine and car models appear to be reused from older games. 6 years, more like 6 months. It's sad that game companies can get away with releasing shit like this for a premium price. If you want deeper information, I recommend the ""Forza Motorsport is Everything That is Wrong with Modern Forza"" video by UltraViolet. He really brings to light just how terribly low bar this game is.

Now with that being said:

   I love Forza. I've been around since Forza Motorsport 4 and Forza Horizon 2. I've played all the games up until this point except for the full versions of Forza Motorsport 7 and Forza Horizon 4. I did play the demos, though. After all of that, I was hoping to finally be able to play a motorsport game on PC. However, I'm severely disappointed with this game. Please do not buy this.
For me, the biggest problems with this game are the severe lack of content and the way progression works.

Content:
There's only a handful of tracks in the game and a few variations of each. The tracks look good and play nice, but there is just so few. The car list is fine, with quite a few returning cars but also a lot that are absent. I assume Turn 10 intends to add some of the others later as DLC. I just don't feel like this is worth 70 dollars. Dozens of games have come out before this with more content for a cheaper price. 

Progression:
Progression is terrible and doesn't make sense for a Forza game. Who wants to drive the same car in circles for 8 hours to unlock one upgrade for it? On top of that, I dislike the points system for upgrading the cars. Instead of spending the in-game currency to upgrade, you have to spend points to upgrade. The game will tell you no if you don't have enough points to install an upgrade you've already unlocked. You have to level up every single new car you purchase before you can start putting upgrades on it. This is not fun, AT ALL. We're not researching a tech tree. We're buying and upgrading cars because we want to drive and race them. Imagine wanting to race a friend in a specific car, but it turns out they don't own the car or the upgrades for it, so you either have to race it stock with them or make them level it up for hours on end. Who thought this was a good idea? 

Graphics/Optimization:
The game doesn't look the best at certain times. I run the game on max settings and some things just look like they were from a game that came out 10+ years ago. I think it mostly has to do with odd ways the game may light certain scenes. On top of this, the game doesn't run very well. It's certainly playable at max settings, but I get frame drops from time to time. I do have a 3090, 11th gen i9, 64GB of RAM, and an SSD, though. 

The Good:
There's only a few things I like about the game right now. It is probably, by far, the best racing game on PC for driving with a controller (with pretty much all the assists off). Another thing I like is being able to completely change the event I'm doing while I'm in the event, so I don't have to sit through 2 loading screens to back out and load back in if I want to change something. Pretty much everything else is either subpar or satisfactory. 

Conclusion:
Please, don't buy this game in its current state. After 6+ years of wait, this game is not finished and shouldn't be listed as such. I'd prefer people to put the pressure on Turn 10 and Microsoft to actually finish the game, if that's what they ever intended to do in the first place. ""Live content"" killed Halo and it'll probably kill Forza too. Please stop releasing unfinished games.",1696954992,1704930251,False,12,0,0.575819075107574463,0,True,False,False

- Terrible performance. I have a high end gaming laptop and can play Forza Horizon 5 at near max settings at 4K with a nearly consistent 60fps in all weather conditions (DLSS ON). The game looks sharp and colourful, runs smooth, and is a great experience. In Motorsport, my laptop struggles to maintain 60 fps at 1440p at medium settings. The game looks flat, textures are blurry, and it looks FAR worse than Horizon, an OPEN WORLD game with destructible objects and the same detailed car models. Microsoft, explain.

- Default tunes are garbage. This can be dismissed by many by saying “get good”, but the faster cars come with tunes which make them entirely undrivable in any circumstances. I consider myself decent at car control, but a novice at tuning, as it is too granular for me. When I started getting put into S2 cars after the first few career tournaments, I found my performance vs the AI’s was lacking as I would spin my wheels when exiting corners even with the most careful throttle control. After consulting several online guides, I was able to fix the problem somewhat, but I lacked the knowledge to actually do anything else.  Say what you want, at the end of the day Motorsport is a SIMCADE racer with a low barrier to entry, and there’s no excuse for how bad some cars handle with the default settings.

- Car selection in Career. I want to play with a larger variety of setups than just front-engine rear wheel drive! It seems like most races are locked to just this basic setup, which is fun for the first few races, wrestling the car around corners and gently  feathering the throttle to avoid spinning the tires, but please let me use a AWD or FWD for once! All rear wheel drive cars in this game handle pretty much the same, way too much wheel spin on launch, unstable under braking, and snap oversteer on turn exit. It just wore me having to give 100% concentration race after race, practice session after practice session, in case I put that one toe over the line and flew off the track. At least Horizon let you choose what car to drive, though I have my own problems with that…

- Bugs and glitches. I can’t comment on the more recent bug fixes, but they don’t sound very effective. When I first started the game, it was pretty regular to get glitched segment timers, meaning they would either not time me, or would wrongly say I was going faster/slower when it was the opposite. The penalty system was far too inconsistent, slapping down multi second penalties for collisions that were clearly not my fault while I would sideswipe cars off the road and be let off with a warning. I have no idea how they would fix these issues as there is no way for the game to know for sure what my intention was. Once, my AI opponents upgraded by an entire performance class mid-tournament and I had to tune up my car to be competitive again, meaning that I had to completely relearn my cars handling. It sounds like many more bugs have been introduced since I last played…

However, I wanted to give some positives that I enjoyed. The point system for car parts is fun, but annoying for faster cars as they aren’t competitive unless they’re at the top of their class. The AI is challenging, and can be aggressive, which is cool. I enjoyed how sometimes they would crash as well when in a heated battle for first, giving me what I felt was a well deserved win. I like the new selection of cars and I can drive some of my new and old favourites. I haven’t tried multiplayer, as I didn’t feel “good enough” to play but might give it a shot now. I honestly expected more incentive to play multiplayer races like in Horizon but found none which is surprising.

Overall, I will probably come back to this game in a few years, unless it gets abandoned by Microsoft.",1704929704,1704929704,False,5,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

The driving experience on a gamepad/controller is actually pretty good and can be a lot of fun. I can't really use the PS5 pad for GT7 (I prefer a wheel) but CAN use a pad and enjoy myself with Forza - so this is a plus. 

Cons:

Lack of personality - honestly, it just feels so boring and safe. It feels as though there's no identity. GT7 feels like a love letter to cars with such an attractive presentation that takes you through the history of cars....There's NONE of that here, it feels like turning in the bare minimum to get a passing grade. There's boring menus, boring voice over, boring features. The package that surrounds the racing is woefully under cooked compared to their competition. T10 should be happy the driving is solid, but for 6 years of dev, this isn't good enough.

Career Mode is boring - the races just aren't that exciting.

Performance is still VERY uneven on PC. Graphically this game does NOT look like what was advertised - and that's a whole separate issue/discussion...but it also doesn't feel like it should be demanding the performance it is with such disappointing image quality...I hate to kick it while it's down but this was the same situation with Starfield - middling performance for visuals that don't look that great. I think it could be argued that Forza Horizon 5 looks better in some instances; which makes no sense.

Piggybacking on this - the amount of bugs, errors and defects is astounding and really shows a lack of polish. Again, you look at GT7 and you see this highly polished product that feels like something car manufacturers would be proud to have their car featured in, and then you come to Forza and car paints are inaccurate with bad lighting, car proportions and features are incorrect, or in the worst case, the car is an old model from a previous game with NO IMPROVEMENTS. 

AI - Awful awful awful - it feels like the AI doesn't take other drivers into consideration. This is a VERY sore point and needs to be addressed asap. 

Lack of proximity radar - get rid of the arrows and give us a better solution for tracking the proximity of other drivers in certain views.

There's a good base here I honestly believe; it CAN be fixed. It will just take a long time. I hope they do stick with it as PC is missing it's AAA GT equivalent. Launched as a 5 out of 10 due to bugs, now a 7 out of 10 as of Jan 2024. I only recommend this on a hefty sale; at $70 I cannot. It's earned the mostly negative due to the horrible stability at launch and lack of proper communication from the devs. They say they listen to feedback, but their latest update reads like they still have blind spots on player needs/wants. Hoping this changes going forward.

Sidebar - doesn't it feel like Microsoft is just pushing ""minimally viable product"" games out onto Gamepass hoping to get subscribers? These games often launch in subpar states and have to claw their way back into good graces - Halo Infinite, Redfall, Starfield, now Motorsport...what are they doing over there?",1704903742,1704903742,False,4,0,0.502617776393890381,0,True,False,False

It might be really different from previous FM titles, but I wouldn't know and going into it blind is a great way to not get disappointed bc x is missing or y is different.
The driving physics are pretty great and realistic. I'm only using a controller for now but it's time to dust off the G920 since I've heard great things about playing with a wheel. 

Update, this port is a MESS, the graphics options randomly switch b/t FSR and DLSS and it runs worse to look worse than the Horizon titles. Is the physics engine SO demanding it ruins the graphics and performance? Why can't this game run well on windows ffs? Why do I get the bright magenta missing textures for a LONG time after the game loads. This game WORKS, and is fun, but if I weren't so focused on the perfect driving line I'd hate the performance and gfx all the time. Seems  like they put all their gfx budget in realistic blinding by a setting sun.
Update 2: The graphics don't wig out anymore and your setting stay where you put them. There are still weird flashes and artifacts when things are loading in for the 1st time or loading in the background. DLSS is doing a LOT of work. Frames are kinda meh @ 1440p with a 3080Ti (and an aging 9900K, the PCI3 limitation takes 3% of performance off the gpu as well) with all the options turned up but forget ray tracing.

The driving feels great and the feel of using a wheel is also nice.  That, and the sound design is top notch.  Cars sound great and the soundscape shifts with where you are on the track, echoing around you as you approach the finish line.  However, that's where the positives end.

The performance leaves a lot to be desired, especially with how mixed the visuals are.  Some aspects look downright gorgeous, while others look even worse than their Horizon counterparts.  The low quality reflections on the car body come to mind.  To top it off, the vehicle leveling is downright atrocious.  I'm 50 hours in, and I only have 4 cars up to max level, and let me tell you, I didn't enjoy even a minute of it.  It all boils down to the same strategy of doing 10-20 laps at Le Mans because as far as I can tell, it's the fastest track to grind levels for cars.  That setup will take you over an hour per race, BTW.  Definitely not time well spent.  The reward isn't even worth it, honestly.  If you get 5 cars from the same manufacturer to max level, you get a max of a 25% discount on cars from that manufacturer (5% per maxed out car).  On a surface level, that's not great, but it gets even better when that reward is reused even on manufacturers that only have one car featured in the game.  So yeah, a lot of good that discount's gonna do you.  If I had to hazard a guess, it was either to pad out the length of the game to 'keep players engaged' or something like that, but I'm more convinced it's because they're planning on adding Ubisoft style XP boosters to the game as microtransactions.  

At the end of the day, I'm not having much fun with it given the XP system basically makes it so you have no real variety in how you set up a vehicle.  You'd have to grind for hours just to find out the vehicle's trash if pushed past A-class, and there's no way to get that XP back or transferred to another vehicle.

Your multiplayer FPS is limited on purpose, as this is a more simple and streamlined solution than actual optimization and makes sure the game sucks equally for everyone.

Shamefully greedy monetization practices for a full priced game. It's obvious content already in the game was ripped from the launch version to be released as DLC later on. There are events locked behind DLC paywalls, and basic cars like a BMW M2 are also locked behind DLC.

The game is grindy on purpose, but fear not! A premium ""VIP"" pass doubles the rate that you earn credits for the low low price of $20. This is in addition to the $30 car pass that gives you one new car per week (not available for purchase in game without the DLC) for 30 weeks. I've played phone games with less greedy monetization. 

The AI are absolutely terrible and the penalty system, while a good idea, is horribly implemented.

Wheel support is ok, but requires lots of messing around in the settings and trouble shooting to get basic functionality (Moza R5). Other games that are much older are plug and play. Most of my issues were solved after inverting force feedback.

This game is a prime example of modern gaming and corporate greed at it's finest. The remnants of potential that form the silver lining around this steaming pile of dog s**t make this release even more soul crushing.

Edit: My original review was after only a few hours of play. I've sunk around 70 hours into the game now and I can definitively say that it is still an awful game, and you shouldn't buy it. 

1 out of every 10 races goes well. The rest are full of rammers. And the person who gets rammed tends to be the one who gets a 5 second penalty after being punted into a wall. 

The penalty system is well intended, but just doesn't work. At all. Someone enters the track and t-bones you? You get 4 seconds. Someone uses you as a stopping block in T-1? No penalty for anyone and you're in the wall. It's embarrassingly bad.  

The safety rating systems means nothing. You may be matched with people of a similar skill, but the matchmaking system seems to make no effort whatsoever to pair you with people of similar safety rating. I'm not sure why that rating system even exists. 

The weather system, mechanically, is fine, but is so poorly implemented. Rain on the track feels like rain on the track, especially when it occurs 75% through a race when everyone is on slicks. No radar system. No indication that rain may happen. Just an alt-f4 when you don't feel like spending the next 4 minutes driving like a grandma until you can pit, switch to rains, and finish out your 1 remaining lap. 

The game has accelerated tire wear in online races. I imagine the goal is to encourage tire strategies without having 45 minute long races. Do you run medium-mediums? Or do you run hards for the majority of the race, then switch to softs and blast through everyone on the last couple laps?  Maybe you can stretch hards through the whole race and catch people pitting? The answer is you use mediums. Everyone uses mediums. That's it. Probably a pointless gripe about this game, but again, an interesting mechanic that is disappointingly implemented

But hey, after 3 months at least the game stopped crashing every other race.

Career mode is really bad if your car is completely stock.  It takes so long to get a tire upgrade since that's the first thing I would like to do.  Heck, it's the first thing I do in real life if I want to go out to the track or some autox.  But $100 for early access and the only thing worth playing is multiplayer?  They sure played me.

I would like to add that I play mostly the TCR races as it's a race series I enjoy watching and currently a series I like playing in this game.  I don't know if T10 implemented caster right for this game as TCR cars rely on very high caster to not understeer in tight, slow corners.  If you're wondering about caster, go see why go karts with no suspension can turn the way they do.  It has a great effect on FWD cars too.  Heck, go look into the FK8 and now FL5 and their dual axis front suspension.  8 degrees of caster is insane on those cars.  In Forza here, you can only do a max of 7 degrees.

Edit #1 after update 2.0:
When starting up the game, it shows a black screen.  I have to alt-tab and hold it there for it to actually load the rest of the screen.

The game also crashes WAY more often now.  Since I have an AMD GPU, I have disabled SAM and running default settings instead of overclocked setting.  This improves stability but it crashes when trying to race.  Cannot even start a race.

Think I'm done with the game.  Uninstalling it now until the game is FULLY fixed and not this beta.  I'll see the reviews of update 3.0 but I don't have any hope after the crappy release of update 2.0.",1697007438,1704662510,False,9,1,0.520600259304046631,0,True,False,False

The menu's feel nice and easy enough to navigate, kinda reminds me of Drive Club (RIP) and it really has promise to be a solid game. BUT this game has a lot of issues.
1. I can't even get through the startup screen without having to hit the windows key over and over to minimize/maximize the game window because it hangs up on everything before and during the ""logging in"" and title screens. Seems to not play well with UW monitors during startup. 
2. The AI is extremely aggressive, can often act like you are not even there on the track.
3. Complete lack of actual PC settings in the menu, it feels so much like a port, none of the settings you're used to seeing or explanations of what they do are currently in the game, disappointed coming from Forza Horizon where they are present. 
4. Looks good, but it's no where close to the trailers and I'm on a very high end PC. I was expecting more.

I didn't want to buy a pass because I wanted to earn my car and feel the ""Build it, not buy it"" mentality this game was pushing until I hit there paywall.

- AI have 2 modes: When the player is far, they will be at their maximum, according to their difficulty settings. But when the player is near, they switch to a horribly dumb AI: If you are behind them, they will break-check you on the slightest corner. They will take a corner at a irresonably low speed just to slow you down. If they are behind you, they will dive-bomb you or cut your line, crashing themself in the process half of the time. They are also so easy to defend against: simply taking the inside and they will do nothing. If you squeeze them lightly or cut their line, they will crash against the wall instead of simply slowing down.

- Penality system and Safety ranking is so broken from what i've seen that I don't want to even try multiplayer. Taking a penality for being push from the inside where there is space or for being push on a straight line is wild. Not only that but rammers are treated so lightly: Forza community is wildly know to being rammers in general, and that type of behavior should have been their number 1 priority to deals with. Better detection system, harsher punishment and/or some sort of system that only slow down the rammer instead of the victim.

- Cars sound like trash. FH5 had better sounds, why do they sound worse than their older game? Search for how the LFA or Huayra R sound, it's painfuly obvious how bad they sound.

- A lot of fast car have poor handling and are way too slippy (LMP, Track cars), you have to tweak them a lot to make them decent. Why should I need to tune heavily TRACK cars that are made for the TRACK?

- Car leveling is really annoying if the car is horrible without a specific upgrade (slick tires, anti-roll, suspension, etc.) or if you already know the car well enough to know its flaws.

- The sharing system (Tunes, liveries) is made in a worst way than FH5, which was already flawed. Searching for a livery or a good tune is a pain in the ass. No only that but tune sharing is kind of useless because most top tunes are locked level 50 tunes. Instead of simply not showing you tunes that are not for your car level, you have to download and save the tune, a slow process that take something like 30s, before the game is telling you that you don't have enough Car points. Genius thinking from guys that made it that way, really.

- Menus are generally tedious to navigate. You will see flaw and bad UI/UX decisions absolutly everywhere. Not only that but, there is loading between menu transitions half of the time.

- I play the game regularly since its release and their no clear sign of improvement beside bug fixing. The game should have been bug free at release so it's not an excuse. Big updates at the moment are bug fixes and 5 cars from older Forza but with shit sound, modeling errors, and broken physics. Kudo to the AM Valkyrie having a full tank capability of around 2000 laps of SPA, still the case 2 days after its release. Did they know about QA testing or hotfixes?


TL;DR: If you have a PS5 and want to play an ""arcady"" motorsport game, buy GT7 instead. It's a better game in every aspect, even if GT7 is far from being flawless (especially on the solo content).

The games seems much smaller than prior forza's(not horizon). The career mode seems very structured so gone are the years of being able to choose between a bunch of races to do. Its very much 1 -2 -3 A - B - C kinda career play. 

The worst part of this game is the leveling each car.. If you buy a mustang to race and then decide to drift it then you have to swap all the parts and tune because you can just buy another mustang and mod that one the way you would want for drift unless you plan on leveling the 2nd mustang from 1 all the way up again.

Don't be fooled into thinking there's anything shiny and new here, you would have a much better overall experience on previous titles with a more polished game.

So much was promised for this release, so much that it's not even called Forza Motorsport 8, instead reinvented into the all encompassing, standalone one stop shop that is ""Forza Motorsport"", one final hoorah to conclude a series of games lasting close to 2 decades. 

- It is now 3 months after launch and tracks from previous games are being drip fed as ""new"" content. We just got Yas Marina. Yay! The copy paste is palpable. Yet requests are consistently falling on deaf ears to return actual fan favourites like Fujimi Kaido. Again, your final iteration for the series and there's minimal effort to make it feel complete.

- There are no drift or open lobbies. I find this a majorly offensive move to what is some of the longest lasting player bases in Forza titles. Had I have known this wasn't to be included I would have not brought the game. Absolutely braindead decision.

- The car models that you expect to be reused from 10 years ago, are still being reused from 10 years ago.

- Customisation is still ass. Every release I fall for the same trap of buying myself a JDM car lets use the Silvia S14 as an example, built to modify, gargantuan aftermarket. 1 front/rear bumper option that basically looks stock. It is such a piss poor low effort that I cant even find the words. Furthermore they could implement such simple tiny changes that have a big impact. eg. painting roll cages. Suppose we can finally paint brake calipers so that's one positive in a sea of radioactive steaming hot garbage. 

- Wanna change your exhaust? Get fucked.

- Wanna put in some racing seats? Get fucked.

- Car level up system. It was/is a terrible idea and should have been discarded early, but because of typical developer ego it will remain, as a roadblock, a hurdle and a detriment for anyone hoping to experience a racing sim. At the very very least I should not have to level up the same type of car twice. I have 40 hours logged on this game and about 35 of them are from AFK levelling up. Objectively this is a disaster because your playtime or even player base is artificial, I haven't been engaging or building any kind of connection/appreciation for the game instead my enjoyment and freedom to use it has been withheld purely to increase playtime. This is the only reason and it adds nothing to of value to the game. Don't come at me with some bullshit about ""building a relationship with the car"". The only relationships that have been affected are indicative by my disdain for each and every slimeball that creatively shaped Forza Motorsport.

First, a couple of good points:
- The driving physics are a welcome step-up from the previous game. It feels tighter, more responsive and more precise.
- They are slowly ironing out bugs. (Okay, so this should be expected, but I had to think of another positive for this game). On release, the game was quite literally unplayable for me. It's... well, *more* stable, now. 

And the bad:
- Single player career. Hardly any events, all of which are short sprint-style races. There are no events with set difficulties to challenge myself with.
- AI drivers. They simply can't race properly. I've seen them braking on the apex of a corner, and even on the exit of a corner into a straight. If I overtake on a straight, they sometimes swing out to hit me. I never get the sense of battling with another driver for pole position; it feels very static. The thing is, the AI CAN drive well, when they're alone. It often leads to most of the pack languishing as they constantly brake and refuse to take overtaking opportunities on the first lap, while the car that started first extends a large lead. Combine that with the short races in career mode, and you're in a mad dash to overtake as many cars as possible before you're held back too far by them.
- Progression system. To upgrade your car requires that you drive it. The thing is, it takes hours to fully unlock the upgrades for a single car. Get a new car, you have to go through the same process again. This has knock-on effects for multiplayer and the Rivals time-trial mode, where you won't be competitive until your car is upgraded and tuned.
- Graphics. Sure, there are some nice details, but it's all undermined by a horrible blurriness that I can't get rid of. It seems like there's some shoddy anti-aliasing going on, and there isn't an option to turn it off. Even upping the rendering scale doesn't solve the issue, leaving the game looking weirdly out of focus. It also goes for a washed-out, desaturated look which I personally despise.
- Optimisation. I'm on a 5900X with 32GB RAM and an RX 7800XT. Even with ray tracing off, the game has places that consistently drop below 60FPS. Lowering the graphics further doesn't help, so it seems to be a CPU optimisation issue. For a game like this, consistent smooth performance is key.
- Multiplayer. There's really nothing stopping other players from ramming you and ruining your game. There is a penalty system, but it's inconsistent in the magnitude of penalties, and who it considers to be at fault. I've had races with malicious players, but I've also had races with good, fair players. Multiplayer is limited to 60FPS for 'competitive reasons'.
- Atmosphere. This is a bit subjective, I know, but the game lacks any kind of excitement or character; It just feels rather soulless and corporate. 

Overall, I very much regret my purchase. Most of my 'playtime' has been spent trying to figure out how to mitigate blurriness and improve performance. That was when I wasn't replaying events due to game crashes and it not saving my progress. Even now that the game is actually functional, I'm finding it a chore to play.

[b]I have edited my original comment, which is in italics below[/b]

Although I still have a lingering bad taste in my mouth from the original release, I must admit that after the last update the performance issues have [i]practically[/i] gone away.

I say ""practically gone away"" because there is an instance or two where I can feel some stuttering, but it may happen once in a long long while.  There have been instances when the game just comes to a grinding halt as if it were going to crash, but it manages to get back on its feet and move on.

So, definitely not 100% fixed, but nevertheless playable.

I get somewhere between the high 50s and low 60s fps with native 2560x1440 resolution, high settings everywhere except for terrain and shadows, which I've set to Medium.  DSSL to Ultra, but no raytracing.

Recap: the release of this game was bad.  Really bad.  However, they were relatively quick to address the main performance issues, and although they should have done that before release --a change in management, and hiring of whiz QA testers is in order, definitely-- they reacted and delivered in a relatively quick turnaround time.

The flow of the menus are contrived, and that is another symptom of higher-salaried management that should just stay in its lane and let experts decide.  It is bloated, and poorly-thought-out.  The transition scenes are a nice touch, but the cumbersome flow of the menus and options really turn something that should be ""wow"" into ""groan let's just get it over with"".

This Forza team should really play and learn more from Horizon 5 for ease of use when it comes to the customization menus, the race selection flow...well, competent, non-Boomer UX design. 

All of that said, the point of the game, racing, is fun.  It's not to avoid.  But I won't be buying pre-release games ever again, until I know what I'm getting into from them.

[i]
I am very displeased with the performance issues.  AMD Ryzen 7 5700G, PCI 4, 32 GB RAM, RTX 3060 w/12 GB VRAM, two 4GB WD BLACK SN850X NVMe.  I can barely have it run above 50 fps, often in the low 40s (FPS locked at 60 FPS; unlocked gets worse).  Lowering resolution from 2560x1440 (native) to 1920x1080 has negligible effect.

Forza Horizon 5 runs smoother than butter at around 80-90 fps on average, often 90-120, Ultra settings (FPS unlocked), same machine.  2560x1440 @ 144, no problem.

Forza Motorsport?  Frequent crashes.  Graphics settings often reset or switched around randomly.  The section times often get messed-up (if you do a few 10ths of a second better, sometimes it counts, sometimes it doesn't).  The stuttering can make you dizzy in the middle of a race.

It's very much in Beta.  No announcements on where they are on their bug list, whether they're working on a patch for AMD CPU + Nvidia GPU setups.  Only self-congratulatory updates.

I'd wait maybe a year.  Maybe.[/i]",1697215903,1704445511,True,0,0,0.506726443767547607,0,True,False,False

Outside of Steam's issues, I've put in over 60 hours and am adoring this game still. Single player is pretty light, but they do frequent limited time events to give single player more things to do, the vehicle set is rather robust, the tracklist is nice, and the game can look somewhere between rather solid to downright gorgeous (try it with full ray tracing on Hakone at night time to see what I'm referring to).

Played only on a controller but controls are very tight and responsive, multiplayer is a fun time, and I've genuinely enjoyed collecting cars.

Played on a Ryzen 7 7700, 32GB@5200, and tried both a Radeon RX 6700XT and a 4070, ran well on both systems with some in-game tweakings (I recommend 1440p High settings, Quality FSR or DLSS, Variable target using G-Sync/Freesync or V-Sync if you can't use those set by Radeon or Geforce softwares, and ray tracing set to full reflections, everything else left on Auto)",1704434285,1704434335,True,2,1,0.486398696899414063,0,True,False,False

I will admit that this game has come a bit of a long way, but there are some issues still and YES the game is installed on my SSD. My gaming PC is brand new that I have built myself  (I'm an athletic nerd, dont judge me lol) with all of the hardware from late 2023. 

Issue One - There are a bunch of graphical bug in the game where they are either ""manageable"" or not at all to the point where I had to reduce my graphics quality to medium. I dont mind doing that, but there are still a series of lags, glitches, and freeze time that make the game unplayable.

Issue Two - Multiplayer has been a bit below par due to not just the graphical issues, but also due to matchmaking. There would be instances where I would be in a race/lobby where everything is fine, no one is trying to be a butthead or anything like that, but then in the next session there would be a group of people who would blatantly cheat and not get caught. ITS NOT A SKILL ISSUE for me before you think that, but it not only effects my experience but everyone else's too. 

Personally, I don't care until some random person would be in the session and he or she is losing so badly that they end the session for everyone while running a bunch of game logic scripts to the server or using macros that go from slowing everything down to having the server timeout and not reachable.

Play at your own risk or let this cook

Edit - After the recent updates (and YES, the game is installed on a SSD since the beginning) the game has improved a bit with some lesser to moderate bugs still in it.

Car progression sucks. I don't want to level my car for god sake. 

There is no Nordschleife. Really? The game isn't ready until Nordschleife is ready as far as I'm concerned. 

Graphics are meh. I'm talking completely maxed out with ray tracing at 4k. There is no grass to be found. It's just a flat green texture. I don't really have performance issues (3900x/6900xt), but when you take into consideration the sub-par graphics, then yeah the performance isn't really justified. I turned off ray traced ambient occlusion and gained 30fps, and kept car reflections on, so I'm satisfied with 80+fps. Also some of the car models are pathetic. I'm not one to really gripe about inaccuracies and I actually did not mind the ""standard"" models in GT5/6, but some of these models just look so cheap and unrealistic. The 240sx tail lights look straight out of an original Xbox game. There is no depth to them and the same goes for a lot of the models. 

Online is very limited. There is no way to free run/track day online unless you start a private lobby with friends only. Come on now. Why is this game so anti-social? Online are featured events only or private lobby. Wtf?? No free run lobbies is basically a deal breaker, I won't be playing much online. 

On that note, single player is also limited. There's not much to do compared to previous titles and it doesn't utilize all of the cars available. Of the events I've done, there are only 5-7 eligible cars for each event. Even when there are other cars of the same category that could clearly be eligible. I find myself in free run most of the time, just trying to level up my stupid cars. I feel ridiculous just typing that. 

No drag racing.

AI are terrible. It seems like they hit you on purpose. I could be completely off the racing line and the AI will swerve off the racing line just to smash me. Even when overtaking on a complete straightaway, they will swerve right into me. WTF??

Car customization is on the weak side. Some cars have a decent amount of body kit options but others have nothing but a basic lip or universal wing. Also haven't seen any rear diffusers yet. Can't believe I'm saying this but Gran Turismo 7 has the new Motorsport beat in the customization category. 

Overall the game is not even close to complete and definitely not worth the money at this point. It's a solid racing experience but it's missing everything else.

And the game crashes and freezes. A lot. So much that it makes the game frustrating. Spend 20 minutes practicing/qualifying only for the game to freeze when the race loads. Infuriating and unacceptable. This game is still in alpha phase. 

Oh and obviously can't forget the HOLY GOD TIER META MIATA they refuse to fix. This thing has about 50 less performance index points than it should have, so online it dominates absolutely everything in every class it qualifies for. Who knew the Miata was the fastest car on the entire planet. So don't expect to race online unless you like every one of your cars getting whooped on by a girl car. Because they will. By several to 10+ seconds a lap. UNREAL

I can't in good faith recommend buying this game in it's current state. I've been on the motorsport side of Forza since Forza Motorsport 2, and this game is largely disappointing. This game is proof of Forza Motorsports fall from grace and it's sad. I bought this game to have the most up-to-date forza with the most players to race against, and with the player numbers constantly dropping it fails to deliver even that.

With the yapping: 
Most races I enter (from a pre-determined, temporary hopper) have about 6 players. A 25 player lobby with 6 players. The progression system is flawed, the penalty system is absolutely abysmal, and the bugs are still very numerous and apparent. I don't want to grind 4+ hours to finally be able to upgrade the car how I want, just for it to be a very mid build for it's class. And that's AFTER they ""made it less grindy"". No one wants to play 20 hours just to finally be competitive in a single hopper.

The multiplayer experience is not great. But actually racing in the car FEELS rather good. The single player is awful, and the fact they resorted to FOMO for their career rewards tells a very important story. While we're at it, maybe we should stop this thing where we get dropped IMMEDIATELY into a race on first start up. It's obnoxious. Motorsport also doesn't know if it wants to tend to the casual crowd or people who are serious about racing, and that's a problem.

Players found a way to make the game less grindy (by letting it play itself overnight (or the wheel spin money glitch), because the game progression is disgusting), and instead of realizing ""oh hey maybe this isn't working for the game"", they punish the players by removing the work-arounds. Maybe the GAME is the problem, and not the players. I didn't do the money glitch, but the fact that you RESET their credits because they didn't play your BROKEN game the way you wanted them to is pitiful.

Rework the progression system (or remove it), FIX the penalty system, and maybe instead of adding new content, make the existing content playable? Some endurance races? Anything?",1704135511,1704135511,False,4,0,0.530069947242736816,0,True,False,False

Its like the devs forgot what FUN is. I really dont like the CP in this game, makes me not want to play it. FM3/4 really was the best in the series for me, i went AFK for 5-7 but really am thinking about buying them since this is such a let down. Why cant i adjust each SIMULATION setting for fuel and tires and such, hate how theirs only 3 options, Forza was about options.... Oh did i mention this game has an expiration date. The moment turn 10 doesnt want to have servers this game doesnt exist anymore, just another reason to hold onto the older FM games for as long as possible. This is not a complete game, its a very boring game thats extremely linear and repetitive. The menu system for getting in a car and painting it is the most ridiculous thing i have ever seen, your already in the car but now u got to pick the car to paint the car. i was already in the car GAME!! Yes this is a game! Or is it! Its ridiculous. Im sure theirs more crap missing but it just all is rather boring, menu system is just blah with so many features that seems lack luster.. I got a car to lvl 24 after a race series, now you want me to do that for every single car, boring. Races are really long even for crap cars. I hate how i cant just skip a practice session so many unnecessary loading screens just to skip the practice run. Did they not know that was a great feature in the old FM games.  And since CP is tied to your car level, lets move on to the upgrades, theirs not that many. This game needed another 6 years because its the worst ive seen.  Also the music for this game is boring, makes me want to fall asleep, its not inspiring, sounds for cars just all seem generic. Maybe they should go back to the drawing board and give us FM8 no BS in like 8 years. This is not the last FM because it was the worst one in the series.

Update: 12/31/23
Just wanted to see if anything has changed since i last played which is about 2 months. Nope not a single thing.  I will like to add that its crazy to me to go to like a game of  GTA5 and go too tires, and see that your tires change. And then u got to a game like FM and do the same and nothing changes when you make a tire size change. Its those small details that amazing game developers can say you know what the visuals and sounds are just as important or more then a graph showing u numbers. Turn 10 doesnt know the difference because the team that lead the franchise to success is no longer their. Its just a studio with 0 passion for racing and customization and more about hoping you stay glued to the races even ones in super slow cars. I cant stress this enough, go play any of the old titles.

Touring and GT3/GT-LM cars are also outdated and include close to 10 year old models (Bentley Continental GT-3 2014) while missing modern cars to race.

At this point in time, I would tell most people to hold off buying this. I think the developer needs at least 2 years to nail down the fundamentals of proper design in this game. While I have always loved the Forza series, I would say this title is not worth anyone's money. It is sad too since I grew up with the series as a child and it feels like the developers care less and less with each iteration of Forza.

i live in a country with the most weakest currency meaning i had to save up 6 months of my wage to buy this game
long story short the last motorsport was fm7 which was a decent game and compared to this game its much better or at least it was
i dont even know where to start first of all basic stuff such as playing offline or builders cup(story) requires u to have internet connection which is a huge joke considering its almost 2024 the graphics are not optimized in both quality and fps some high end pcs get blurry pictures some get alot of black screen and fps drops even after so many updates for my self i have changed the nvidia image scaling so i get sharper image.
the bugs in the game are life ruining personally i had to redo about 50 races of builders cup cuz in the first month of the game save files were getting deleted 

now to in depth stuff: 
the game progression system is the most dumbest thing iv ever seen in order to get parts for ur cars which u need to win races u need to lvl up ur car and u can lvl up it by racing which is the unlimited circle of no brain move
cuz i need to use the car for a specific series which i need the fastest version of that car and i cannot get it until i race with ??? so either i have to race the car in free play for hours to lvl up or just give up on winning in the main races
the multiplayer is broken af we have alot of glitchers and people who abuse the car system
the penalty system is a childs play cuz if the car is spun out it gives penalty to the last car it had contact with regardless of the impact or even if the first car was ramming and lost control
the coop is non existant in this game i cannot invite my friends and race against bots even as a individuals only way is u againts ur friends with no bots which is the most basic kind of racing and private match
the car models are absolute madness basically its like forza 2 all over again which todays graphics nothing is built from 0 in this game
i had hopes i could join a community of racers and have fun but dont see that happening the way it is rn maybe in a year or two after alot of updates
but not everything is bad
the car variety is awful not many cars at the start but its starting to improve
the feeling of cars is good the tracks are decent but again not many tracks in game
fuel management and tire compound is finally here and its good 
the car parts are now more detailed compared to last games
and so on
the game is below mid rn and is not worth the money unless its like atleast 30% off or they fix the problems
if u really want to play it i suggest xbox game pass for a 30 day trial  
i hope this review will help u guys and if u have any questions feel free to ask

Not Enough Cars

The AI does not race cleanly. Perfectly happy to push you off track or spin you out. Car list is disappointing compared to Forza Motorsport 7.  Game crashes happen far too often. The front couple of AI are almost always too fast to catch. Lowering difficulty makes races far too easy.

If you're looking for multiplayer online racing then run.  Run away,

Multiplayer is broken.  So so broken.

First of there's no match making to speak of.  You will have a no lifer who's lapping 4 seconds faster than you and people who can barely keep it on the track in the same race.

Unless you are cutting corners the penalty system is non-existent.  Taking a corner too fast and smashing into someone to slow yourself down is a very effective strategy.  You come out ok.  You are rarely if ever penalized and the other person usually ends up the wrong direction off the track.  In the rare case you do get a penalty you are still in a better position than the person who you punted off.

The game claims to have a safety rating system.  I have the achievement for consecutive races at top safety rating.  It does no good.

If you piss someone off they will intentionally pit maneuver you.  This is against the code of conduct and you can be banned for it.  To file a report you need to submit a replay.  Multiplayer replays are broken.  They've never worked.  They don't save.  It's literally impossible to report people

Forza Motorsports, the premier title from Gridiron Studios, is a game that seamlessly merges the intensity of a football match with the high-octane thrill of the racetrack. Buckle up and get ready for a sporting experience where the roar of engines competes with the cheers of a roaring crowd.

Quarterback Cars:
In Forza Motorsports, your fleet of cars becomes your team, each vehicle representing a skilled quarterback ready to navigate the twists and turns of the gridiron. The precision required to handle these virtual thoroughbreds mirrors the finesse of a quarterback threading the needle with a perfect pass.

Tailgating Tactics:
Strategize your tailgating tactics as you draft behind opponents, strategically choosing when to make your move. Just like a football team exploits gaps in the defensive line, your driving skills come to the forefront as you find the perfect opening to surge ahead.

Pit Stop Playbook:
The pit stop becomes your playbook in Forza Motorsports. Execute flawless pit stops to gain an edge over the competition, akin to a football team executing a perfectly timed field goal or a well-coordinated special teams play.

Touchdown Tracks:
Each racetrack becomes a gridiron, with every lap presenting an opportunity for a touchdown. The thrill of crossing the finish line is the equivalent of a game-winning touchdown pass, with the crowd erupting in cheers as you secure victory on the track.

Fan Engagement:
Forza Motorsports captures the spirit of fan engagement seen in football stadiums. The virtual crowds react to every daring overtake and strategic maneuver, creating an electrifying atmosphere that mirrors the energy of a packed football arena.

Championship Conquests:
Just like a football team aiming for a Super Bowl victory, your goal in Forza Motorsports is championship conquest. Climb the ranks, outmaneuver opponents, and lift the trophy in a triumphant celebration, echoing the glory of a team hoisting the Lombardi Trophy.

Conclusion:
Forza Motorsports is more than a racing game; it's a thrilling fusion of speed and strategy that channels the excitement of a football match. Gridiron Studios has successfully crafted an experience where the roar of engines meets the roar of the crowd in a seamless symphony of sportsmanship. Whether you're a racing enthusiast or a football fanatic, Forza Motorsports offers an exhilarating journey into the world where the gridiron and the racetrack intersect, resulting in a game that scores a touchdown in the hearts of sports gaming fans.",1703862594,1703862594,True,0,1,0.408319950103759766,0,True,False,False

Sure I don't have too mush time to play this game consistently, but this game is already very poor on content and you make me missing some content by throwing it away? Just for that it's a big minus for this game.

Looking at the content for the forza motorsport 7 and this game, matching the content of these two games, it makes me sick. It brings to my mind only one word, no, actually two: pathetic and sadness.

Also I installed on one of the car the advanced body kit, and now I see through it, but not because of it is the feature of the body kit, but just a lack of textures for this body kit. How can I be involved emotionally in this game and not lose the suspense of believe, when this game loses its textures and consequently its integrity right in front of my eyes? My gosh, I see wheels and asphalt through the body of the car! After that I just switched off the game. It reminds me it's the game. I cannot drive the real car like I do in forza, and I don't have all cars in the world, that's why I bought this game, but when this game reminds me of its nature, I cannot help it and just lose interest for it. 

Otherwise, yeah, it would be beautiful game barely with any content.

Chris Esaki (lead designer) and his ""vision"" are still trash and he should be fired. He should go make some phone game and make money via moms' credit cards and gtfo of Forza. People like him are a huge part of what is wrong with the gaming industry, especially AAA titles. 


Previous review: This game is actually great. I can overlook the graphics issues and bugs because they will be fixed in time and it looks and runs good enough. Cross-platform is awesome. Xbox controller is really good now that I tweaked my layout and deadzones. Car selection is great and driving physics remind me of the pinnacle of the series in my opinion: Forza 4. I am also fine with the upgrade system because you get acquainted with a car while you tune and upgrade.

What I hate that causes me not to recommend the game at this time: 

1. I hate the hand-holdy, unskippable tutorial bs. I absolutely can't stand being forced to drive hatchbacks. I would go to a VW dealership if I wanted to do that. I can't let this happen. There are only a few class series in the campaign, with no E and D. I am afraid I just have to stop playing the campaign and do free play or multiplayer.

2. The multiplayer has its moments, but is unfortunate. The car selection is amazing and they are so fun to drive. Too bad for you, though. If you like driving real, attainable cars (but not hatchbacks) then there isn't anything for you this week or the week before last. You are forced to drive 900hp on rails P-class cars or GT cars. If you want to join a custom lobby, you can't. All player-created games are hidden unless you specifically invite people on your friends list or organize on another platform. The only option is to not play for the week if you don't have a big network of people who play. You can't even add AI opponents with friends. I had to drop the campaign because of the lack of open class races and now I have to do the same with multiplayer. The only option is to sit and stare at the wall. 

In closing, I think Turn 10 is squandering this. At a glance, there are real-life atrocities taking place and Turn 10's sins may seem like non-issues, but they cause actual suffering and tens of thousands of ruined gaming hours across the globe. The collective displeasure and frustration caused by Turn 10 equal thousands of lifetimes of unhappiness. I think those in charge of the forced class P multiplayer should have their IRL assets sold off, be paraded through the streets in chains, and jailed for a long, long time. My general feeling of malaise is due to your actions, Turn 10. I cannot overstate this.

I will recommend this game once these two wrongs are righted.",1698708687,1703790165,True,0,0,0.51369398832321167,1,True,False,False

1/5 Stars - There's possible long term potential but wait for serious updates before buying.

Pros:
+ Improved physics model that closes previous unrealistic gap between RWD and AWD performance. The driving feel improvements is why I originally decided to keep the game instead of refunding it.  I now regret that decision however.

+ At least its available on Steam, unlike Gran Turismo.  I'd prefer Gran Turismo 7.

Cons:
-  This is a barebones skeleton of a game which could improve over time with massive updates. Game is more a live service, subscription (GamePass) focused time waster than a complete game you  play for fun.

- Unforgivable car leveling grind that disrespects your time and probably intended to drive GamePass engagement measurements

-  Uses FOMO racing event car rewards to force you to grind through like 20 races in a few weeks, otherwise you can't get the time-limited car reward.  When I missed the Lambo Sesto Elemento, I just uninstalled  the game.  I don't want to grind every week in a racing sim.

- Lots of graphical and performance bugs.  After you change performance parts, or just after about 30 minutes of play time, the game will drop to 20 FPS and you have to close and re-open game to fix.   I normally play at 4k Ulta/High, Ray Tracing Disabled, on a RTX 3080.

- Very poor selection of tracks and extreme lack of visual stimulation.  It’s like driving through Kansas on the interstate, making it hard to stay attentive and not get sleepy.  Desperately needs urban city tracks and kudos system like Project Gotham racing

- A lot of missing body kits, a poor selection of actual GT cars,  and a lot of boring and unnecessary E, D, and C level cars that are painful to level up and not worth the grind

- The game has a very poorly designed, poorly optimized modular feel where there's constant looping in maze-like menus with painful loading between each option selected

-  They recently gifted players the 2020 Audi R8, which was also available as a reward.  They won't let you sell or remove gifted or awarded cars, so you're stuck with two of the same car in your garage.  This illustrates how barebones and poorly thought out the game is.


Overall, I just really dislike this game and the studio that made it.

The game is good but its a downgrade from previous versions. The tracks and cars look good and the driving feels really good for a simulation racing game after all the updates (First week was rough). However if you're not going to spend all your time grinding this game its tough to recommend it.

The main issue is upgrading your cars; you cant use your whole budget, you're allocated limited credits after each race to purchase upgrades. To unlock upgrades you have to keep driving that car. IDK who thought this would be fun but.... its not it, makes the game boring and casual gamers cant just buy a car tune it how they like and go race. WHICH IS THE MAIN POINT OF THE GAME. Now when i hop on it feels like a chore.

Another downgrade is the car exploration, more limited then previous versions where you can get in and start the car and just rev and listen to the majestic sounds (its the little things for me) also no narrator for cars which again is a personal nostalgic preference. But it also shows a lack of effort. Im a very casual racer so i don't even bother online.

Its a quick review but I wanted to give a fair warning to casual racing fans before the spend $60",1703731653,1703731653,False,8,0,0.546849608421325684,0,True,False,False

Forget all the teething troubles and bugs, there are so many bizarre choices that I'm absolutely baffled by.

1. Terrible handling. The handling feels way too heavy and understeery. I know I'm not the best driver but every car I tried feels like ""a shopping trolley full of logs."" This was not an issue with previous games.
2. Changing from credits to car progression points in the upgrades menu is just stupid. Credits worked just fine in all of the previous games.
3. Paint car menu appears to take place on a cloudy day - this was an option in 7 I believe but it was just that - an option.
4. The car displayed in the main menu is not whichever car you are currently driving. This has been a feature since Forza 2. It allowed you to know what car you were currently driving, but now you have to go into garage to see what car you're in. Not a big deal but again, it's absolutely baffling.

I've been doing a lot of sim-racing (iRacing, Assetto Corsa & Competizione) but had room for a more simcade experience with a decent career. I hadn't played a Forza Motorsport game before but I loved Gran Turismo in the past, which is most comparable.

This edition of Forza Motorsport doesn't tick any boxes. Physics is passable but force feedback is pretty poor (especially compared to iRacing and the Assetto Corsas, on a Fanatec CSL DD 8nm). Graphics are not very good and despite this it still runs pretty poorly (AMD 7800X3D and RTX 3080). Even maxed out it looks a fuzzy, overly post-processed, mess. Turning off ray-tracing gets 100+ fps tho which is fine. Modded Assetto Corsa is ancient and looks better. Arguably so does iRacing if you like a clean look (very debatable 😊). The career mode is completely soulless. I've barely done any of it and got bored. Multiplayer gave me a couple of good races at the start... but I'd rather go play iRacing for that anyway.

If you want a simcade experience with some actual fun and a good career mode, look to F1 2023 or EA Sports WRC.

The whole CaRPG element is actually quite good, and have found it logical from a progression and learning curve perspective. Also the online multiplayer is one of the best experiences as the new penalties system is as close as you can get to being the major reason why there's so little intentional collisions. People have complained about the things I've outlined above but for me they're the biggest selling points bey far from someone that started with FH4 then went to FH5 now FM.

HOWEVER! The penalty system is frankly dire. And the game since making it to Game Pass has become riddled with bots and rammers beyond belief rendering the penalty system pointless. Also if a car pins out in front of you and goes from 150 mph to an absolute standstill in a fraction of a second, then pray tell how is anyone without reflexes based in quantum reality going to be able to stop in time without accidentally colliding with a pile of static cars blocking the entire width of the track and gaining a 4.00+ second penalty? Answer is; you don't. This feature alone renders getting the 10 clean multiplayer achievements completely impossible. I only managed to get the 5 clean multiplayer achievement the day before it was published to Game Pass. And on that day rammers reduced my S rank down to a B rank. Today this has happened again, Taking it down to a C rank. making achieving an S rank impossible and somehow putting me in with the absolute worst drivers on God's earth. Fix this. Also tonnes of bugs with cars and paints have come to my attention since migrating to other vehicles to achieve the different challenges. Really basic stuff like wheels not changing to the colour selected etc. Every car this is a problem for. One didn't even have the manufacturer's badge but a placeholder logo still present! This all needs fixing sharp as there's now a exodus of competent racers leaving, resulting in matches of even A rank just full of rammers. Making the aforementioned perfect multiplayer achievements even more unattainable. God knows what it must be like for new players. Absolute hell I presume.

You can crash and lose progress in singleplayer, you can crash right before a race starts in multiplayer, and players can exploit their way into bringing cars exceeding the class restrictions into multiplayer races. Plus there's some bug either with the game or AMD's drivers where you have to optimize shaders every time you launch the game.

This combination of things literally makes the game unplayable, and this is all still happening AFTER the first patch, which was supposed to address a lot of the most pressing issues. I want this game to succeed because the multiplayer is the most fun I've had online in a very long time, but it does not deserve to succeed.

EDIT: There have now been 3 major updates over the course of roughly three months. Lots of bugs have been worked on, but crashes are still around. Some of these crashes have been in the game since launch and can be replicated with ease, some are new (such as one that blacked out my monitors and made my computer unusable until reboot). The graphics are a blurry, ghosting mess due to either the forced TAA, their forced dynamic render setting, AMD FSR, or some combination of them.

Sound design is good. The visuals at least for me are very up and down. Some things look really good like reflections and RTX, but car models, track models and frame rates are all pretty mid to bad. In my opinion, a lot of what was advertised visually is not even close to what it looks like when you play the game.

I think the UI is incredibly bad. The menus are horrible. I can't use my mouse in the menus to click or select things, it doesn't work. This game wasn't ready for a PC release. Adding a livery to a car can take upwards of a minute. 


Single Player Experience:

My main focus is not single player so I don't have much to say about this aspect.

I think they have a lot of different kind of races which is good, however the structure of the campaign is not very good. I don't like how their is no qualifying session. You choose where you start on the grid. This becomes boring very quickly. 

The AI computer controlled cars is pretty dumb. Lot's of videos online that show the behavior.
Online Multiplayer Experience:

The bulk of my play time has been online. Playing with 2 other friends and the odds of all 3 of us getting into the lobby or actually starting the race is about 30%. Someone is either getting disconnected, or game crashes or map textures don't load. 

So many bugs. Performance is pretty bad. 

The Safety Rating and Skill Rating system is a joke, I am pretty sure it doesn't actually exist. 4800+/5000 and I am still getting queued up with players who don't understand racing and/or racing etiquette. So many racing incidents that the game blames the wrong person. 

They have a decent amount of variety for their multiplayer ranked lobbies but it's constantly hampered by the fact that they are mostly always set to short races. They have a static GT3 class which is good, but they make it a 6-8 minute race, which makes no sense. They keep talking about tire and fuel strategy but you don't need to pit since the races are so short. 

They advertise to build and dominate the competition with our cars in the Open class, however we can't perform any upgrades to the car while in the lobby/during practice. You have to quit the lobby, find your car, upgrade the parts and then you can't join the next race because the time is already past by. You basically have to play your car in single player and level it up to level  30+ to have enough points to do the upgrades necessary to compete before going in multiplayer, oh this is going to take you at least 2-3 hours by the way. And all of the tuning that you do in single player doesn't save into the multiplayer. It's like they don't want us playing online. 

Online replays still don't work 3 months after release, how is this even still going on? 

Having to level up each and every car to be able to buy tires is fucking stupid. I like the idea of leveling up the car, upgrades shouldn't be locked behind level and points.

The economy makes no sense at all. I have like 5 million in the bank with nothing to spend it on, cars don't have real world pricing (you can by a honda civic for 60k and bugati veyron for 100k ) the pricing makes so sense.

I think there is a lot more shit for online multiplayer but im getting tired just thinking about it at this point.

I must really hate myself for having played this for over 260 hours.

Unfortunately, Forza Motorsport 2023 is a step backward in almost every respect. While I'm grateful that I haven't had any technical issues in getting the game to run, the progression design gets in the way of having fun with the game.

Locking car upgrades behind grinding out races, especially any tunable components like transmission settings or tire compounds only serves to pad out the experience. ""Built, not bought"" is a lovely tagline, but gets in the way of what a racing game should be about - identifying what it takes to go faster, and going after it. Making me do laps or not switch cars feels like an attempt to milk playtime out of a career format that is rather boring and unsatisfying.

Then there's the ""live service"" progression. Despite having a VIP membership that doubles credits earned, the time-limited Tours don't pay out enough to afford even the lowest of the low car in the next series in the tour. So I'm forced to grind not only for car levels, but also for enough credits to get a car that allows me to start grinding in the next series of races. It should really tell you something that much of the discussion surrounding the game is how to automate or circumvent this grind. Taking tours away, including the reward car, because I don't have the patience to force myself to play things I don't want to is a real choice.

The game wants you to stick to a car for an entire series which I get, kinda a racing RPG feel. However the cars from stock are terrible in my opinion and get way more fun as you upgrade them which is rewarding! The AI is amazing and terrible. You can get some amazing races out of them but expect them to be hyper aggressive and ramming into you and brake checking you. I do enjoy the racing alot. The Builders cup = fun.
Game is great for a casual race. I use a wheel a pedal setup (T300rsGT) the force feedback with factory settings is Garbage absolute dumpster fire! You are forced to watch several videos just to get a basic setup and then tune as you go. The game offers WAY too many FFB settings, some of the best sim racing games will offer you 1 or 2 setting for FFB and are amazing. this game offers like 30! 
Now the bugs i have encountered
1.) Every single time i start the game I cannot use my wheel. I have to go into input settings and set as t300rsGT, for some reason it always defaults to Ferrari wheel and none of the buttons work till i change. I have DDU my thrustmaster drivers and reinstalled twice. No difference.
2.) kinda follows #1 the accel and decel pedals default to 5 - 95 instead of the 0-100 i set them to.
3. When i change the FOV settings they dont take effect until i get into a different car or restarting the game
4.) i have had some random crashes but none since the last patch (1.0) 

Personal changes or updates i hope that happen
1.) weather forecast, so i know if rain is expected or the track is going to dry up
2.) better ai
3.) better force feedback
4.) better audio

I would still give this game a 4/5 because at its core there is something special there, and if updates continue this game 
will eventually be awesome! Thanks for reading my rant

After latest update, i still have to go into settings and change the default input to use my wheel.

Forza Motorsport is nothing short of a triumph for racing enthusiasts. I can confidently say that the wait to play was well worth it.

Graphics and Realism (5/5):
One of the standout features of Forza Motorsport on is its breathtaking graphics. The attention to detail in the cars, tracks, and environments is simply outstanding. From the glint of sunlight reflecting off the sleek car bodies to the realistic weather effects, the game immerses you in a visually stunning world of high-speed racing. The level of realism is unparalleled, making each race feel like an authentic motorsport event.

Car Selection and Customization (4.5/5):
Forza Motorsport boasts an extensive roster of meticulously recreated cars, ranging from classic models to cutting-edge supercars. The variety ensures that every player will find their favorite ride. The customization options are robust, allowing players to fine-tune everything from engine performance to visual details. However, a bit more depth in certain customization aspects would have been appreciated.

Gameplay and Controls (5/5):
The gameplay is where Forza Motorsport truly shines. The controls are responsive and intuitive, providing a seamless driving experience. Whether you're a casual player or a hardcore racing enthusiast, the game offers adjustable difficulty settings to cater to all skill levels. The AI opponents are challenging yet fair, making each race a thrilling competition. The inclusion of realistic physics adds an extra layer of authenticity to the driving experience.

Career Mode and Progression (4.5/5):
The career mode in Forza Motorsport is engaging, offering a structured progression system that keeps you coming back for more. The variety of events and challenges ensures that monotony is kept at bay. While the progression system is well-balanced, a bit more narrative depth could enhance the overall experience.

Multiplayer (5/5):
Forza Motorsport's multiplayer is a highlight, allowing players to compete against each other in intense races. The matchmaking system is efficient, and the dedicated servers ensure a smooth online experience. The ability to join or create clubs adds a social element to the game, fostering a sense of community among players.

Overall, Forza Motorsport is a triumph for racing game enthusiasts. With its stunning graphics, extensive car selection, engaging gameplay, and robust multiplayer, it sets a new standard for the genre. While a few minor improvements could enhance certain aspects of the game, the overall experience is nothing short of exhilarating.

Customization is a big let down from the start, not to mention the level system for the upgrades.
Many missing parts on cars you would expect they have at least basic  parts and not the ugly universal forza parts.
The career mode must be the most boring one ever in simracing.
Force feedback is Meh, nothing special.
Many settings for no reason at all, have to look it up to have it somewhat decent, absolute no plug and play, wich is fine if its atleast somewhat simplified and not have to spend hours in ugly and buggy menu ui to set all settings one by one.

You WILL  have to grind multiple hours if you want to customize your cars.

Graphic wise the game is HEAVILY bugged.
It's optimised for console and you notice it heavy on PC.
If you paint your car it looks like your painting it on a cellphone or PS2, that flakey.
It's hugely annoying to put decals on as even Forza Horizon 5 has more view angels ... no matter from which side your decals get bugged, meaning not applied to surfaces on the car.

Gameplay wise it's really realistic and the feel of the cars is really nice but AI is a huge pain in the bum as they drive as ridiculous as the people. 
AI will actively drive you off the road in the side or in your behind and push you out of the corner.

Can you buy this and go racing online? Yes !
Can you do this with a custimized car right away? No. 

Online communicty doesn't seem to be better with the new ranking system.
You still get driven off the track at least half the time and as they said in Days of Thunder, rubbing is racing. 
Don't expect people to get penalties to drive in your rear end.

For me the end review is negative because there is just too much grinding and very little playbility.

If they had reworked the car points so as a tuner you might actually tune cars ... 
use them on any car for example and make all part available from the start?  

This Forza Motorsport is just that what the devs are, half finished products of a society that wants your money and doesn't care what they give you in return. 
Many people do the monkey see monkey do thing and make the game a real CHORE to play.

Forza Motorsport, I have to run it on LOW, just to keep the stuttering and frame drops down enough so I can play the freaking game.

Then there's the problem with the career mode.  Congrats T10, you've turned a beloved franchise into Call of Duty with the absolute shortest career mode in Forza History.  Then there's the race series themselves.  You will be forced to adhere to restrictions, but your opponents will not be.  Have to drive a hybrid?

The problem is not the new physics, fortunately the physics in this game are unbelievably good and satisfying. I could rant forever about how good it is... when it works. 
This game will run perfectly and then suddenly, it begins to stutter and flicker. Without fps drops even. When it comes to multiplayer, well for me there is no playing to be done. It either crashes when loading the pre-race screen, ending practice laps, or worse, after finishing qualifiers. It is a performance nightmare in so many ways. If you play privately with a friend, most of the time your car will not look correct on their screen. It will bare a very strange wrap or look, and also only one of your engine audios will be audible to the other player at a time. For my friend and I, whoever joins the race last is not heard by the other player. I have a very powerful pc, so no... no my pc is not the issue. Also certain paints completely do not work, which is just bizarre. There is much more but you get it. It is a nightmare. They are charging you $70 for a broken game, and have left out MANY important cars that you will absolutely be offered later... for more money of course. It is truly a shame what the game is right now. The devs owe you. This game is horrifically optimized and was not ready for release. 

Still somehow, I find myself playing it because it /could/ be the best car game I have ever played by a long shot. Hopefully they fix it, and give us their already-planned dlc money grabs for free.

EDIT:  It is unreal how long the game has been out, and how unplayable it has remained. The company is lazy and deserves to lose customers over this. Hardly any paints work right, the performance is inexcusable, and the graphics are awful even on max settings because the game is horrifically optimized and can't handle itself. We payed $70-$100 for a proof of concept. Better yet, they expect you already to buy all of their dlc that they have planned for this game. If you have an alternative racing game to play (gran tourismo) I suggest you do so. I could excuse this game on release /sort of/. All this time and no improvements later, acceptance is over. ALSO it is worth mentioning that they promised this game was brand new ""from the ground up"". So why does it have the same wheel/paint glitches from the old motorsport game? Yeah the one where your wheels are correct when parked, and then change entirely when you drive? Still happens. It is the same game. That is, if the paint even works on your wheels in the first place.

I just hope this will follow the path of No Man's Sky rather than Red Fall.

I'm not going to start listing all the flaws, they are too numerous. Instead I will limit myself to three;
1. The AI is absolutely trash. To repeat, the AI is absolutely trash. If you are like me, a bit of a noob racer who wants to practice a lot before going online, just get Automobilista 2. In AMS2, I'm the dummy who crashes into the AI (see why I'm not racing online yet?). In FM2, the AI will suddenly rubber band and smash into you so hard from behind that you just spin out into oblivion. No, come to think of it, the AI isn't trash, it's significantly worse than that.

2. The Builder's Cup - and yes, I read the reviews, I was given fair warning - is also trash. I admit, I was hoping for something like what GT5 gave me oh so many years ago. Something light weight and fun for when my brain can't quite concentrate on AMS2, rFactor 2, AC or ACC. The issue here, though, is that combined with the sub-trash (ultra-trash?) AI doing kamikaze attacks on random, you start off with an absolutely junk setup and tuning, and you can't do a thing about it until you've driven quite a few hours to gain enough Car XP to get the parts you need to even unlock the most basic of tuning options. Sure, you can do this outside of the Builder's Cup and races - but still. And no, I do not like the way you can decide your own starting position in the race. Or to elaborate, I would like to switch that off and just have old fashioned qualifiers. 

3. All the goddamned obnoxious ""cool"" cut scenes and narrations interrupting the loading of a race. It is painfully obvious that Turn 10 spent more time on this pointless fidelity rather than fixing ye old car models from FM4, or indeed, the AI. Or the FFB.

See? I stuck with three. DIdn't even mention the at times mediocre graphics and performance. Or the horridly clumsy menu system where you half the time have to use the Esc key to go back from a menu selection, which is damned stupid when you got the mouse in your hand where the right button MIGHT go one step back, or indeed, that you cannot actually click another menu object until you have clicked Esc to go back. What the shit, Turn 10?! 

In honesty, I would've refunded it, but it took me damned well two hours just to get the FFB work ok-ish on my Moza R12. It sounds silly now when I say it, I know, but the thing is, Turn 10 decided it was sensible to toss you straight into some ""cool"" narrated introductory races where they launch you from a hotlap at fairly high speeds, and usually in fairly close proximity of a corner. This wouldn't be so bad if the FFB actually worked, and say, the wheel input actually kicked in at the moment the count down reaches zero...but it doesn't. So figuring out that crap while cursing my stupidity for not trusting the mostly negative reviews...yeah, time flies...

At any rate, no, at the moment I cannot recommend FM at all. There are hints of a decent game here, but it's covered in so much shitty decision making from Turn 10 that it's hard to tell whether it's a turd, a polished turd or actually a decent feature. I do honestly hope I can switch my frown upside down with the next patch or so, but like mentioned, if you want good offline racing with AI - Automobilista 2 is the best. If you want an insane car selection and perfectly ok AI, get Assetto Corsa with all the mods your heart desires. If you want Forza Motorsport, be patient.

The car selection is pretty slim. The track selection is also pretty slim. The Career mode is dull and repetitive. The featured multiplayer events are dull and repetitive. The game is riddled with bugs and often just plain poorly designed.

Car selection is down quite a lot from FH5 and FM7. They are slowly adding in more cars.

Track selection lacks all street circuits. Nothing from previous games: Fujimi Kaido, Nurburgring Nordschleife, Bernese Alps, Dubai, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Long Beach, etc. We're also missing tracks like Bathurst, Brands Hatch, Sonoma, etc. But they have slowly been releasing more.
There are also no fun events or tracks. Like the previous titles had things like bowling, overtake events, etc. This game has none of that.

The ""built not bought"" progression system is tedious, unrewarding, not terribly conducive to online play. It's generally not well thought out or implemented either. Car exp, separate from driver exp and money, is earned by doing technical sections on tracks. You get bonus exp for getting a good rating on those sections, but the actual rating number doesn't really matter. Sometimes you can get an 8.9 section score and get +25 cexp, sometimes you can get a 8.2 section score and get +50 cexp. 50 and 25 are the only cexp bonus tiers. Many people don't care anyway and will turn all assists on to have the car drive itself around an oval to slowly grind away car exp by itself. It's essentially an idle game.

Ultimately, it is just a gated version of the exact same upgrade system they've had in all previous games. Car development is also strange because when you unlock a ""part"" you can now upgrade that part fully to ""race"" level. They haven't expanded much on the parts or tuning options. ""Race"" suspension is still only 2-way adjustable on all cars. No fast dampening adjustments. No turbo pressure adjustments. No race-grade ABS or TCS. The tuning is still in many ways lacking compared to other sims. About the only thing they added was anti-dive / anti-squat, which doesn't make sense on all cars.

Car development in a career mode series is a mystery because the driveatars never quite match your car's Performance Index score and will sometimes make massive changes in Performance Index score between events regardless of what you do.

The reward for fully leveling a car (if you do this for some reason) is a 5% discount with the manufacturer up to 25%. This is a pretty uninteresting reward. Many manufacturers don't have enough cars for this to matter either.

The AI is pretty bad. They can be fast... if they're by themselves. Which leads to a problem where the race leader just escapes leaving you to get rammed by a pack of slow-moving, incompetent cars that panic-brake for no reason at random points. They crash almost intentionally... actually no, they do absolutely intentionally hit you. This would be manageable except for two things: you can't change race length in career mode, and sometimes even changing driveatar difficulty doesn't effect the pole position car's pace, which can lead to situations where the pole position driveatar is lapping 2 seconds quicker than the rest of the pack.

Speaking of race length, races are absurdly short in career mode. Career mode race length isn't adjustable. At one point you are rewarded with a ""24 Hours of Le Mans"" race when you unlock the Ford GT. It's 1 lap... Tire wear is only a concern in multiplayer so far because the wear rates are increased quite a lot. Fuel consumption is only a concern to make sure you adjust the load down to the little you'll need. Rules like damage, tire wear, fuel use, contact penalties, etc are all bundled together in a single, 3-step option that's just lazy.

The weather effects are decent visually except they seem to have removed key features from Forza Motorsport 7 like standing water, sand/dirt buildup, etc.

Many assets in the game look like a blurry mess on mid to low settings. The game optimizes the car looking good, and that's often it. Visually the game doesn't actually look better than Forza Motorsport 7 overall. They added gimmicks like Ray Tracing, but if you're just reflecting assets that aren't appealing then what's the point? However, many people with high-end systems report a ton of issues too, such as the track just disappearing.

If you're like me and have a steering wheel, you need to remember to set it to custom control layout every time you start the game (despite them saying they were going to fix this, they haven't). Btw, the default control layout and wheel settings in this game are generally pretty terrible. Not only that but the advanced settings for changing this are the least well thought out of nearly any modern racing sim. The game gives you no information about your current inputs to gauge what your setting changes are doing. Want to change pedal linearity... well the game's not going to show you what it perceives your pedal input to be until a race.

Issues like excessive brake pressure on pedal input or controller trigger pull are still there. At <20% trigger pull, the game registers >50% brake pressure. There is no universal setting for this, you have to adjust every car individually.

One really telling screen is the confirmation screen for Free Play that asks if you want to accept the race settings... but you can no longer see what settings you are confirming. It's a microcosm of the prevalent thoughtless design.

The game lacks many UI customization options present in other racing games. You cannot change UI element positioning, color, size, visibility, etc...

There are drift and drag parts... but no drift or drag events.
There is no music. Bring your own.
There is no driver stats screen to view information about what you've done.
And then there's the issues with screen flashing, game crashing, performance slowdowns in menus, bugs with location selection, audio bugs, the list just keeps going...
You can't spectate at any point in multiplayer races, even after you've finished and are waiting for the race to end.
This simply doesn't feel like a full game and certainly not an award-winning game.

This game is not a fair match to the price point or the title. This is the least polished offering in the series, probably. I have played Forza Motorsport 3, Forza Motorsport 4, and Forza Horizon 5. This game feels like a cheaper knock off of Forza Horizon 5. It is clear that this game is just meant to live-service the Motorsport series, so they can see additional avenues of approach to your wallet.

The game's graphics are not up to snuff, when compared to ANY of the Forza products mentioned previously. The game crashes randomly now, as opposed to when I watch race replays. The devs patch fixes and then revert others. I went from being able to load in quickly, to waiting a full 5 to 10 minutes for shaders to optimize. This was after a restart of the client...which was patched in the previous update, so that you wouldn't have to optimize after every boot. The livery editor is the same as FH5, which just felt to bare-bones and stiff when compared to Gran Tourismo. Each car feels absolutely terrible until you have labored through hours of grinding for performance parts. And every part MUST be grinded, you cannot just purchase them.

 The AI isn't the worst, but once you figure out how to be fast, they become murderous. Rather than driving competently, they crash you. None of the cars appear to be spec to the times they run. There are many times that I make it to the front of the pack and struggle against what appears to be a stock car. The tuning system doesn't really give you all the context you need to use it to the fullest. It is a big ole guessing game until you have someone on Youtube explain things to you. 

With all of the glitching, ugly graphics, and grindy game design...I am not sure that I will live long enough to get into multiplayer. I tend to work through Singleplayer first, in order to learn cars, tracks, and get an idea for the breadth of what the game has to offer. I don't really feel that multiplayer is a necessary exploit. It is usually more of the same with added toxicity. If I do get to that point though, I will speak on the multiplayer. My current plan is to just complete the Builder's Cup and go back to Aseetto Corsa.

The second thing is that the AI seems to have been imported pretty directly from Horizon, and it really brings the flavor of mutliplayer Horizon in with it. Want to be on the racing line for a pass? Good luck, an AI driver will immediately slam into you because that's where it wants to be. Get bumped off the track? Enjoy your track limits time penalty. And if you spot one coming out of the pits as you pass by, watch out, because they will get past that white line and swerve as quickly as possible into the lane of traffic that everyone else is already on.

It looks good, sounds good. The driving mechanics feel less unforgiving than previous Motorsport entries, probably again influenced by Horizon. I like the weather effects. I also like the change to the car upgrade system, it makes a little more sense than the open haphazardness of previous games where you could just get all of it immediately. 

The only bugs I've seen tie back to long, looong loading times that seem to come and go.

The Multiplayer is unplayable, the penalty system rewards dirty driving.

new addition after the 3rd update (dec. 23):
-graphics are still in a bad place, a 4070 isnt enough for a decent 60fps on a wqhd
-some cars still have no roof, no interior, no engine, i even got one where my dor and dash didnt load so i could see whats next to me and thats quite nice (but still really bad)
-some cars still bounce around or flip themselves over without even touching the controller
-still the shltty leveling system
-still no driver data at all, i still cant see the time and distance i spent driving a certain track/car

old review after the 2nd update:
-graphics are still dogshlt, you are still fµcked if you use a 3440x1440 screen
-mazda rx7 fc3s still locked into the ground
-the rollbar in my brz now allows me to se through my A pillar, nice buff
-one of my bmw still has no interior AT ALL


now for the complaints:
-we still miss 10ish circuits from fm7
-still no rain/night rivals
-still no way to lock fuel and tyre settings in rivals (medium and 100% by default)

-exp system is still shlt, i dont understand why we dont have a ""manifacturers exp"" and ""cheaper parts depending on that"" instead of the other way round so that we can buy any upgrade from start, but the more cars we have from that brand, the less the PARTS cost

-still no statistics AT ALL: you dont know how many km you have driven, how many laps you have done, which car you have driven most, NOTHING AT ALL


here is my old review before the first ""major"" update:

good game, i have some fun, but many huuuuge negative points:

-same as elden ring, if you have a 3440x1440 screen you are fµcked
-graphics are dogshlt, quality is the same between my rtx 3060 and my 4070, only the fps change between both cards
-after the update the leveling system is faster, but still bad.
instead of a price reduction when multiple cars from a single brand reach 50, we'd prefer the other way round, the more cars of a brand you have, the more exp % you get for example.
there is no point in gaining money faster if we need a finite amount of money anyway, as updates use a specific currency",1698414777,1702814449,False,4,2,0,0,True,False,False

Turns out both of those are actually great and blew away my expectations. New ranking system online is great even though the penalty systems can be unfair at times. The most fun I've had on an online racing game. Many have complained about the grinding required to get upgrades for cars, i don't think its as bad as people make it out to be. When i bring out my V8 swapped Miata to the online session people know I worked at that for a few hours. I think they could reduce the time it takes but its truly not that bad. Where the game does fall apart is the graphical problems and stability. This game can look amazing at times and can look like Grand theft auto 4 at others. I'm hoping this can be addressed quickly and is truly just an error. Stability is the worst I've seen for forza launch. frames will be good at 80fps then will randomly dip to an unplayable 20-30 at times. I've had the game crash on me plenty of times while traveling through menus and crash mid race. Until the graphical errors and stability issues get fixed, i just cant recommend this game at the time

Overall, the racing FEELS good when you're out racing, so that's great news... but in many other ways the game needs work. To name a few:
-Performance isn't very good for what the game looks like imo (although even if the game looked great, that's not a good excuse in my book for it to be poorly optimised (looking at you, Jedi Survivor))
-Menus feel really awkward to me. It's possible I'm just a madman but I tend to get frustrated with the menus in one way or another while trying to start a race. I could say that about a lot of other PC racers though :P (I just figured Forza would be different, I have memories of their menus being slick and easy)
-You probably already know this, but it's missing some of the bigger interesting maps that have been featured in past games and folks have loved openly. I realise these things take time, but it doesn't help their case. Like, eeeeveryone knows Nordschleife. It's a unique and wild map to race on and really push yourself.

That being said, it's Forza. The racing is tight and competitive, the difficulty mode sliders are nuanced and allow you to create a game that pushes you without making you want to punch something. Without the ray-tracing on, the game looks fantastic on my 3070 on high everything with DLSS set to Quality. Career mode is deep, lets you get really comfortable with a bunch of cars, and does a good job of holding your hand if fine tuning race cars isn't something you know a lot about.

The whole introduction was kinda infuriating to play at 25-33 FPS. After going through the intro junk I started trying to change the visual settings myself. Still couldnt get my frames above 35 consistently smooth. After googling the best settings for an RTX 3080 I finally got the game running smooth. Anytime you make an adjustment to the visual settings you MUST restart the game.. After about 1.5-2 hours of initial gameplay i finally got the right settings to run at 60 FPS everywhere. RTX off was a big setting to change. otherwise google the best settings for your card and restart the game. 

Gameplay from here on out has been pretty good! minimal bugs. visual bugs like when I am waiting in the pits for Practice session to end before racing online some of the cars will appear inside of mine and bounce around a little. Havent experienced any bugs that cause the game to crash. The startup screen is weird... it will start Windowed mode then only display half of the screen? it also says (Not Responding) and has a transparent white out across the screen.) after the loading screen and the intro is done it goes to full screen and fully displays properly. Just dont press any buttons while it says Not Responding.

All in all its been a good experience. It will only get better with updates. i'd recommend the game if you really wanna. Im sure it'll go on sale at some point but if you really are thinking about it then i'd go for it. just be ready for a really crappy performance on the intro races then immediately change settings after googling ""best display settings for *graphics card* on Forza"" then restart the game. Make sure your graphics card driver is up to date too. restart PC after that updates.

update: after another day of playing I encountered 1 crash from the menu that took me my to desktop, 1 bug where i was stuck with 1 second left ""intermission"" moments before an online race. 
Other than that still working great at 60 FPS 4K. well wait:: sometimes it will say 60 FPS but i SWEAR its running at like 30-40...pretty sure its ONLY when racing near somebody with less than 60hz connection to the server? (forcing my game to slow down to make sure the person with bad connection appears properly on my screen? my only guess because once you distance yourself from others on the track ( 1 second away from others) it goes away and returns to a smooth 60 instead of a weird/stuttered looking 60 fps... multiplayer only...)

another update as of late: game has been great. still playing on the settings i reviewed earlier. i actually play the game with my RTX3080 at about 85% power to run a little cooler and still get 60 FPS solid. 5800x3d, 32gb ram, 4k.

However, the foundation is there. The driving and physics feel excellent. There's great fun to be had here.

Here's the problem though: It's unfinished and underwhelming.

[h3]Car and track selection:[/h3]

There are a lot of glaring omissions, but most of what's there is good. And there will be more cars and tracks released as time goes on. Some real world tracks, like Road Atlanta and Nordschleife are missing, but this is due to them being recently renovated or changed and will need to be re-scanned for accuracy. 

The classic fictional tracks of old Forzas are sorely missed though. Where's New York, Camino Viejo de Montserrat, Sedona Raceway, Bernese Alps, Fujimi Kaido, Rio de Janeiro, Prague, Dubai? Without these tracks, it feels like Forza has lost much of its identity. 

It would be a crime, in my opinion, to relegate these beloved tracks to history. While this new Forza has some new and welcomed fictional additions, such as Grand Oak and Hakone, it's not enough to satisfy the void left behind by these missing tracks.

[h3]Graphics:[/h3]

While not bad and serviceable, it could be better. For a game who's big marketing shtick was about the graphics, this is disappointing and unacceptable. On top of that, there are of course optimization issues. For a game outputting such sub-par visuals, this is just baffling.

[h3]Physics:[/h3]

For the most part, it feels great, but for some reason many cars feel very understeery, so it feels like you're constantly fighting the car just to make it turn. Because of that, most cars will require a tune to fix it. If you're familiar with Forza games, the driving in this new Forza should feel instantly familiar, allowing you to jump in straight away. Both controller and wheel users should enjoy this aspect of the game.

[h3]Online:[/h3]

Don't get me wrong, there's great fun to be had. Extremely fun in fact. When it works. The penalty system is great, but only when it works. It helps to encourage fairer and cleaner racing in general. When it works. Most of the time however, it penalizes you unfairly for things you can't control. And the same old doofuses who don't know how to drive and ram you for laughs are still out and about like they always have.

There have been many incidents that have been posted all over the Forza subreddit that shows the player who is completely innocent, minding their own business getting rammed into and getting penalized for it while the person who actually rammed into them gets off scot-free. Yeah, great penalty system Turn 10. On top of that, there are frequent server disconnects that rip you straight out of the action back into the menu. No thanks.

[h3]Single player:[/h3]

For me, this is perhaps the greatest disappointment of all. 

When I grew up, from the very first Motorsport game, Xbox live was still in its infancy. Not everyone had Xbox live, including young me. So that meant they had to deliver with the single player experience. And that they did. They couldn't just rely on the multiplayer to carry the game like so many games nowadays.

I was hoping Forza would go back to its roots and put a strong emphasis into making a fully fleshed, single player career mode that makes you feel like you're living the life of a real professional race car driver working your way up through the ranks. This is sadly not the case at all. It's just more of the same career mode style that we've had since Motorsport 5. 

It's boring and soulless. There's no sense of progression, no sense of anything. There's no amateur, or professional events or anything that indicates your growth as a professional racer.  Here's the most confusing part though: They put in all this effort to finally add in animated pit crews, only for them to never be used in the career mode because none of the events even utilize any fuel and tire strategy whatsoever. 

Sure, you can lower your fuel to make your car lighter and driver better, and even change your tire compound. But there's nothing that makes you need to actually pit during a race. They didn't even try with this career mode and it's just insulting. Yeah, okay they're adding more events over time, but it's just going to be more of the same, isn't it?

Turn 10 needs to go back to the drawing board, set up a career mode exactly like how Motorsport 1-4 did, and go from there. This new Builders Cup is the biggest far cry yet from what Forza career modes used to be, and it's a real shame. Players are capable of more than movie theater arcade length races, you know. Turn 10, stop insulting us by half-baking these career modes and give us a real career mode where we start ""from the ground up"", build not only our cars, but a reputation, and gain access to more advanced events with higher stakes.

[h3]AI:[/h3]

Of course, we can't talk about the career mode without talking about the AI. The new and completely overhauled Drivatar AI that Turn 10 hyped us up for in pre-release gameplay demos. Except that's all it was. Hype.

This new Forza AI is complete and utter garbage. It's the same garbage AI we've always had except they somehow made it worse. 24 drivers sounds cool and all, but it's clearly too many for the AI to handle. They slow each other down to a literal standstill, making it extremely difficult for you to maneuver around the field. Paradoxically, when you're in front of the AI, they will often tap you in the rear and sometimes cause you to spin out.

When the lap 1 shenanigans are done, the AI suddenly enters god mode and becomes untouchable. I've played Forza since the very first Motorsport game from 2005. I'm not slow. Granted, I am on level 8 AI, but still. The AI is also inconsistent across tracks. They're faster or slower on certain tracks, which makes it difficult to gauge how you will perform relative to the AI.

I've always disliked the whole Drivatar concept. It was a cool idea in Motorsport 1, but it's just a big gimmick. The idea of racing against caricatures of your friends and other people you don't know might sound like a cool idea, but in my opinion it takes away from the experience. 

Racing against hotwaifu69 does not immerse me in the race. It just reinforces the fact that I'm racing against dumb soulless husks who don't know how to drive. And ultimately, completely destroys any semblance of real competition. 

You may notice however, the same few ""friends"" from your actual friend list may consistently finish high, which is admittedly pretty cool and helps a bit. But I miss racing against M. Rossi, P. Muller, T. Davis. Those guys felt like real competition to me, and they drove better too.

What Turn 10 needs to do is either cut back the number of drivers on track, or fix the AI asap because it is unacceptable how atrocious they are.

[h3]Upgrade system:[/h3]

On top of all this, we have a new upgrade system. I appreciate that they took a gamble and tried something new, but it did not pay off at all. Gone is Forza's one great strength of giving players the freedom to take a car and do what they want with it. Now, upgrades are arbitrarily locked behind a level system that takes hours to grind through for each car. But not only that, if you buy multiple of the same car, each car needs to go through its own level up process. This is just a classic case of if it ain't broke don't fix it. Lesson learned Turn 10, don't ever do it again. Please.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1] 

This game, while having a solid foundation like always, clearly suffers due to many of the strange decisions made by whoever was in charge. But underneath all that bad stuff is still a genuinely fun game. Should you buy this game? Only if it's on sale AND when the game is fixed. If you have game pass, this would be the better option in my opinion. Otherwise, I cannot in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody. Turn 10, please do better next time.

Looking at all of the updates I change my 1st opinion to ""DISLIKE"".
Developers made bad decisions and don't want situation that gamers will have fun...
They like to make FOMO content (time-limited single player events).
They didn't add new permanent single-layer events.
Optimization is bad even after 3 monthes, and game is blurry (i want to fire art-designer who made this art-style).
Car XP grinding is awful system.
They even grabbed game credits from those people who used ingame money-grinding exploit, why? It's not MMO, it was just developers fault. But doing this they said like ""sorry man, you don't deserve these money muahahaha""

1st opinion:

+ Fun simcade physics and handling via gamepad. 
+ Battles on tracks vs AI are good.
+ No-pastgen graphics.
+ Dynamic timecycle and weather.
+ You can drive cars without needs of buying them. 

- Few tracks.
- Blur, blur, blur is everywhere.
- No good optimization (but thanks for no stuttering).

Models and parts of the Track constantly popping in and out, floating camera men, terrible performance, and multiple CTD's were all things I experienced during my 5 hours of playtime. It sucks because if you took away all those problems this game would be amazing.

After patiently waiting for this game to release after it was announced and waiting almost a month before buying it so they could iron out the problems it still has a ton of issues, I can honestly say that this release is a massive disappointment.

First of you have to have a Microsoft account and connect it. Then you had to sit for an hour and play thru tutorials and stuff. After that, every time you opened anything you had to sit and listen to a voice explaining everything.
The ""level up car thing"" isn't a big deal because it didn't take long time.

But I bought this game only for drifting and there is no drift events or anything. So you don't get any money when drifting. That means I have to sit and play regular racing for hours just to afford to upgrade a car for drifting. I can't understand why they making the game so locked, no one wants that.
Why don't have a ""open mode"" where you can upgrade and do what you want instead of having to spend hours just to do modifications and stuff.

Also there is something going on with the clutch on controller, I couldn't play like I've done on previous Forza games, now i had to hold in the clutch for like a second for it to work, that made it very awkward to drive.

I so want to love this game.  It's a simcade game which, in the main, is more sim than arcade in its handling.  Until the MP where the tyre wear is increased so that hards will only just get you to the end of almost any race, medium require a one stop and softs are basically quali tyres.  Most races are 15-20 minutes long, so that will be reflected in the lap count for each circuit.  

The rating system is starting to bed down nicely, and it adjudicates foul play and unfair driving  about as well as you might hope from an AI algorithm.  That is to say, it spots cut corners and off track moments well, (top tip, if you go off track, ease off your throttle to alert the algorithm to the fact that you're not trying to cheat - or accept the time penalty.  The AI however gets foul play via contact right about 90% of the time.  It makes some egregious errors at time (I have been viciously side-swiped and been the driver that got the time penalty several times), but the algorithm  gets it right more often than it doesn't.

Its a pretty game and runs well on my admittedly top tier system.

I must shout out the car customisation tools, by which I am referring to the aesthetic ones.  I love designing and sharing my car liveries and get a burst of dopamine when ppl use mine and/or post likes.  Its great to see your distinctive car on the grid, racing against other players.

MINUS

But oh my word, the crashes and I refer to game crashes, not mine.  It's still a massively frustrating issue.  On launch it crashed one time in three and always at least once every 90 minutes.  Moments after posting the above review I tried to launch the game and it crashed twice and in fact, now won't launch at all.

I have a major gripe in that the multiplayer replay still doesn't work and that's a big thing for me.  I love replaying my races, learning from other's, from my mistakes, and analysing (and reassessing whether I was in error or my competitor when accidents happen.)  two months post launch I'd expect this to be fixed.

For the last three days the game has always crashed when I try to exit it, and there is a huge lag from when click onto a menu item to when it responds (30-45 seconds).  So a lot of waiting around wondering if its going to respond or has in fact crashed (again).

Many times there is a graphical bug that can show up at any time during practice or even a race that makes the road disappear and become transparent, so that it is impossible to know where to go. The game often completely crashes just after doing an upgrade to a car. 

These very serious bugs exist alongside frequent and annoying frame stutters, which really shouldn't happen on a RTX 4090 laptop with Core I9 13900 and 32 GB RAM. I had to buy this because I no longer have a Playstation and Gran Turismo is still not available on PC unfortunately and although this could be a very nice alternative if the bugs were fixed and the framerate was smooth and consistent, I really cannot recommend it in it's current form. Turn 10 really has to fix these bugs, because they are bad and serious.

Update: the track disappearing doesn't happen as frequently anymore but overall I still find the graphical experience to be quite disappointing. The overall graphical experience is still quite inconsistent and weird pop-ins and stutters break immersion. The replays are stuttering and cameras frequently zoom in so far that the visual quality of the background becomes very bad and last-gen. The drone-like view of the grid before the race looks off and not realistic and has frequent strange pop-in of objects. 

It's quite disappointing to me that a brand new game on PC with 4090 looks substantially less good and runs much less smoothly than GT7 that came out over a year ago on much inferior hardware (PS5). I'm still tempted to buy a PS5 to play GT, which is a huge disappointment because I really should not have to buy much worse hardware to play a game with much better graphics.

The career mode and overall racing in FM is unfortunately not as engaging and addictive to me as I found previous installments of Gran Turismo which I did play. (I played GT Sport on PS4 Pro a lot in the past and loved it; spent way more hours on it before getting bored.)",1697221315,1702301830,False,3,0,0.503105580806732178,0,True,False,False

- Is the game fun to play?  Yes.
- Is it worth the 70 bucks?  No.
- Can I recommend it… probably not, but maybe?

This is my first ever Forza title, as such I had little in terms of baggage of expectations for the title; most of my expectations were based in rumors and experience with other titles over the past few decades.

The game itself plays just fine, physics are just what I'd expect of an arcade racer like this.  The graphics are just fine even on my less than ideal machine, even though as this is designed to last several years of future updates and as such maximum settings are out of reach;  the lower settings look just fine.  Graphics is secondary in a racing game anyway, the most important feature of a racing game is:  

Is it fun to play?  Both alone and with your friends?
In short, yes.  If you like racing games and circuit racing—especially on the more arcade side of things—you're probably going to have fun with this, at least for a while (as long as you're ready for the AI to drive like absolute plonkers, as is tradition).  Herein comes some of my unmet expectations.  I expected there to be some form of actual career mode where you work your way up from like an MX5 cup and work your way up to prototype hybrids, or similar.  There's a mode called career mode, but it has no career mode in it; it's just some janky cups where you drive road cars, road cars, and more road cars, and that is another expectation of mine:

I expected a game with ""Motorsport"" in its name, would have more actual motorsports in it.
And frankly…this game, doesn't.  It's about 500 road cars, with about a dozen really badly implemented race cars thrown into the mix, and unless you do a free race or time trail with those race cars…you'll never encounter them, at least not in single player.  In multiplayer, first thing you do is you get to drive some form of racing type vehicle, and it handles decently. Once inside the multiplayer mode though, another of my expectations gets thwarted:

There are no custom lobbies.
I had plans, for months, that when this game comes out, we'd do community races in it with my tiny community, feeling that this game would be a perfect low barrier to entry kind of game that anyone could join, from gamepad and xbox to direct drive wheels and premium edition steam version.  Once the game was released, I found much to my horror, that there is no useful multiplayer mode if you don't want to do ranked races against randos…never not once did I imagine a game like this, wouldn't have a good way to play with small groups of people (and no adding every single person in my community to my xbox friends list is not a viable option).

I also expected some unimportant things that you don't get in racing sims like character customisation and such.  Really rather lackluster experience in that regard.  On the flip side you also get your AI drivers populated with random xbox gamer tags, which is kinda' gross and pulls you out of the experience, but not enough to actually matter.  Who cares if you get beaten by XxBigUnicornDong69xX or not, really.

So, can I recommend this game? Kindof…but not if you want to play with friends.

Can I recommend this game, if you have to pay 70 bucks for it?  Sadly, No.

1. Physics feel pretty good, a step up from previous games. Differences between tyre compounds and weather is noticeable.

Con's:

1. Nearly all the fantasy tracks from old games are gone. Re-scanning tracks to be used with the new physics doesn't affect these, so why aren't they in the game?
2. Virtually no up-to-date race cars.
3. Much smaller track list, with tracks being drip-fed every month....maybe.
4. Career is a woeful experience. Exceptionally short, randomly themed championships and at no point can you use a racing car....in a game called Forza MOTORSPORT. There are also rotating championships which absolutely should not be time limited, especially in a career that is virtually non-existent.
5. There are drag tyres in the game, but no drag racing mode, despite work being done on an experimental drag mode in the previous game.
6. There is drift suspension and tyres, but no drift modes in-game.
7. The car levelling system is horrible. It's extremely slow, very limiting, is limited to each individual car you buy/ drive, even if you already have a Skyline R34, if you buy another, you have to level that up separately.
8. It is insanely buggy. Track disappearing, cars missing parts from the front and rear bumper to literally everything but the wheels, replays not saving or being watchable for the entire race, engine audio being incorrect or just missing, incorrect or missing shift animations, the list goes on.
9. Car class homologation isn't particularly well thought out. Why are V8 supercars grouped with GT3?
10. AI is possibly the worst of any Forza game ever. They either panic excessively when you get close and drive off the track, or they don't care that you are there and will drive through you. Not to mention braking in stupid places, rejoining the track dangerously, pushing you off the track and generally being incompetent.
11. Penalty system isn't great. It will often not penalise spinning someone out, but will penalise if you've been crashed into.

Please view comments for quick ""updates"" as I continue to gather my thoughts.

Looking for a polished, laid back track racer experience? Well keep looking, scrub. Not a hint of polish in sight, and DEFINITELY NOT ""Built from the Ground Up"" as they claimed. Yet another Bold Faced Lie from the T10 team.

# My Hardware
I'll start off by listing my hardware as to avoid any accusations of ""oh your PC cant handle this game"" or ""your settings are too high for that hardware"".

I've got an Intel i5-12400 paired with an AMD RX 6700 XT and 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM, and installed on an nvme SSD. Roughly the performance of an X-Box Series X I'd recon.

# Graphics & Performance
I benchmarked the game with every setting maxed out, ya know, to see if my rig can handle all that ""fancy tech"" at 60fps 1080p. Nope. Averaged 37fps and that was BEFORE I tried with Ray Tracing! Not a good start, *especially* since the game look nowhere near as good as other similar titles, ie Gran Turismo SPORT, GT7, Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, GRiD Legends and more.
I dropped everything to MEDIUM except for Textures and Livery Quality, which I left at Ultra. I achieved 59fps in the canned benchmark. fined enough and the visual quality didn't worsen at all too, so my thinking is that we're getting deep in to diminishing returns with this game. The game SHOULD Look better and run worse rather then look basically the exact same and run worse.
Then I maxed out the Ray Tracing while maintaining my current MEDIUM+ settings and only lost 1fps in the benchmark. Leaving it on I guess.
In the end I've come up with THESE settings for a stable 60fps at 1080p. Oh, and I enabled Image Sharpening in AMD's Adrenaline software. Set to 50-60% to get rid of the game's natural softness.

NEXT, let's talk about Game Stability.
Well it F*/ing SUCKS dawg!! in my first 10 hours I got 6 Crash to Desktop (CTD)!! And they ALWAYS happen during loading or the transition from practice to the race, meaning if you've partied up with friends there's a good chance you wont even get to race with them in the event. I'd recommend going and completing the first episode of DOOM (1993) as you wait.

# Bugs
Lots of these guys. from avatars disappearing from the podium to cars mating in the pits to not being able to adjust your fuel + tires before the race because the game goes in to another arbitrary loading screen for 99% of the intermission time between races. There are just too many that show up and it's pretty disrespectful as someone who spent $101 Canadian Dollars on a product.

# The Driving
## Overall
It's fine. Nothing ground-breaking, but a clear improvement over Forza Motorsport 7. Which I hope because it was ""Built from the ground up"" right right right? LOL! It still has a lot of carry-overs from FM7, like weirdly bouncy kerbing, ""forza glue"" during contact and more.

## On a Pad/Game Controller
The best way to play the game hands down.

## Wheel ""Support""
What a fucken yoke, bro. I've got a Direct Drive wheel (MOZA R5) and there's just no feeling in what the car is doing, let alone feeling under/oversteer. Stay away from using a wheel, it's not worth it (for this game).

# The Career
It's mediocre. Nothing of note except the weird car specific leveling system, which is bad and doesn't carry over to owned duplicates. Just a bad experience overall. Gran Turismo 1, 2 and so on have better progression than this 2023 game and they came out in the mid to late 90s.

# The Online Experience
It's quite good actually. A good building-off point for further enhancement. Penalty System still needs a little work but other than that it's quite fun. I haven't even encountered a ""proper"" rammer in the Featured Online. In fact, I've had some really good, consistent and really close racing with people I've never met! Sure Lap 1 is usually quite messy, but still!, it's quite fun.
But that's about the only positive so far.

# Conclusion.
Five plus years for this? dafuq was T10 doing all that time? definitely not rebuilding the game from the ground up lmao. Quite the joke of a game, and REALLY NOT RECOMMENDED until all of the issues get fixed. And I mean *really* fixed.
Fix your game T10, you're making a fool out of yourself... again.

- I have a 75Hz monitor. The game FORCES it to 60Hz for me so when I select ""V-Sync I can only go up to 60Hz as opposed to 75Hz like it SHOULD BE!
- V-Sync set to ""ON"" makes transition scenes and such run at 30fps but v-sync ""OFF"" lets it run up to 45fps... and my GPU is only being used sub 50%",1697129681,1702230809,False,4,1,0.500822842121124268,3,True,False,False

Original Review:

PSA your multiplayer framerate cap is based on your monitors refresh rate, run it at 100Hz/200Hz to get 100 fps cap. i personally i prefer to run it at 144Hz with a 72 fps cap in multiplayer since i wasnt getting a consistent 100fps on most tracks with high graphic settings. (3440x1440 / 5600x / 7800XT / 32GB ram@3200 / 970 evo 1TB) i am also using AMD's Smart Access Memory and Fluid Motion Frames with FSR Off since i get lower frame rates with it on.

this is one of those times i wish there was a neutral option for a review.  im shocked there wasnt a day 1 patch. most of my issues started after around 12 hours of playtime and my experience is slowly degrading as time goes on. it went from no issues at first to my game crashing after races to it crashing a couple of laps into a race. soon i fear the game wont even launch because its becoming self aware and slowly killing itself.

i only recommend due to no neutral option and i truly have enjoyed my time on the track with my G29 racing wheel when the game was working properly. the physics feel improved and with some FFB changes my wheel feels nice. if you are on the fence i would recommend waiting a month or two until this game has gotten some patches in to address the stability and performance issues some players are experiencing or try it on gamepass since your experience may vary.",1697041579,1702188334,False,0,0,0.5071868896484375,0,True,False,False

It's a solid game that delivers what I personally wanted for really long time on PC, 
Forza that's focused on track racing. There's ok amount of racetracks with more to come (live service). 
Unfortunately being a parallel development by other studio didn't benefit from some nice features Forza Horizon offers.
It offers solid driving physics, as well as pretty good force feedback, unfortunately developers left FBB configuration all to the players it's good but takes a long time to figure it out.
AI in the game is as good as your average multiplayer lobby, you'll see them pile on in first few turns in every race, while 5 cars on the lead are good drivers and offer fun racing challenge.
Career could definitely be better, all it offers is race categories called builder's cups, where you have to pick a single car, for 4-6 races, and upgrade it along the way. 
There's no variety to this beside well changing a car and class of race.

This game has over 500 cars more or less and the likeliness of the average player to ever drive HALF of these cars is abysmal. Let alone the games jank driving mechanics, while in all respects good, it feels like any mistake made on a curb is met with the runoff or the barrier on some tracks. Not to mention the handling on controller with the Exotic class cars like the Formula One cars or the Endurance class cars are, on controller, twitchy, hard to drive and overall noncompetitive against those with an actual wheel which can turn out proper articulation.

There is really nothing else quite like this on PC. The collecting and modifying semi-sim track racer that Gran Turismo popularized has NO real presence on PC.

At some point the bugs and performance will be ironed out. There's more than enough money and time behind Turn10 to invest into getting the technical portion right.

While I agree that the upgrading process and funneling into limited car classes can be aggravating at times, I never found it so frustrating that I didn't want to race anymore - you can always go into freeplay with the car you want and earn car level and credits as it gives you race after race based on your settings - and there are open class races out there.",1702060978,1702060978,True,7,1,0.521462082862854004,0,True,False,False

I have been playing the game solely on the Moza R5 setup which has been a blast and the Force Feedback has been incredible. For the first few weeks I played and was amazed about the tire degradation, fuel consumption, the anti dive settings and so on with the highlight being the penalty system.

Now the kicker, However long it has been released I have found myself not playing the game due to various issues, the biggest one being frame rate. I have a well optimized system with a RTX3060 and I cannot seem to get out of 40 FPS online which happened during the last update. The unbalanced penalty system is very frustrating online as I race in real life and try to apply the same principles. This game needs a serious fine tuning from the 007 smoking cars, missing interior graphics, disappearing track while driving, and so on. The biggest complaint I have is there is not an online Open Trackday anymore! How can you make a track dedicated game without open track days for continued online challenges with friends or tuning sessions with players. Another thing to note is if you level up a car to level 50 it should apply to all additional cars that you purchase of that model. i should no have to level up my second eagle talon to level 50 to make it a contender in a lower class.

I have been playing forza since FM2 and I was in Middle School, it is safe to say that the turn10 Forza titles have gone downhill since FH2. It will take a lot to make up for the disastrous launch.

I have Around 75 to 85 FPS constistently.
Comments are enabled specifically for this as most people seem te have fps problems and i wanna help if i can.

Second of all, this is my first time playing any Forza Motorsport game ever.
So i have no comparrison other than Forza horizon.
With that said i do think that the car progression does need a little tweeking.
It is a bit insane that i have to drive (by my estimation) over 100 laps with every car just to fully upgrade it.
For people that enjoy testing new cars and finding different setups, This i gonna take a long time.
It is important to note that i have not put a lot of hours into this game and my opinion will change over the course of time.

The rest of the game right now feels challenging in a good way and the gameplay itself is fun.
The overall feel for the cars in general is definitly leaning towards Sim Racing and not Arcade.
For me that is a good thing but it can turn people away if you are used to Horizon.

I've played every single FM except for 6, and I spent hundreds of hours on each one except for 7. I cannot in good conscience recommend FM2023. The satisfying driving is completely overshadowed by everything else. Progression - while better than it was at launch, is still awful. Nobody asked for a separate currency for upgrades. Just let us use our credits. 

My friends and I used to do ""Top Gear challenges"" in the older FMs where we'd set a budget, set a target class or required make/country of origin/decade/whatever, split up and buy and upgrade our cars, come back and surprise each other with what we picked, and then race each other on the Nordschleife. 

We can't do that anymore. We'd need to spend several career races leveling the car up to be able to unlock the upgrades and then buy them with the stupid upgrade points (assuming we earned enough for that specific car), and then once we'd do all that we'd still not have the Nordschleife to race on because it didn't ship with the game. 

Visually...I don't know what is going on with this game, but the cars look horrible. Paint looks flat no matter what settings you use. You can look up comparison videos on YT for this but it's horrendous. The 360 games look better. This isn't even about the reused FM2 models. Cars just don't look right. 

I'm honestly just getting disappointed writing all this out. I really REALLY wish I wanted to play this game when I look at my library. I had more complaints to say but after the first anecdote and waxing nostalgic of the good ol' days I just kind of ran out of steam, and any anger I had just turned into disappointment.

Those issues you see in all the other reviews? Yea they're all true and this is another one to add to the pile.

- First startup had issues connecting to Xbox account. You know, the one I'm already signed in to on Windows, already have open on Xbox app? Can't use it. (may be fixed now, search for local administrator account fixes if you still have issues)

- Immediately thrown into 15+ minutes of intro races and cutscenes without ever seeing a main menu. God help you if you need to adjust settings for controls, audio, graphics, or anything else normal

- The UI is often completely unintuitive and ambiguous, like nobody had actually started up the game with fresh eyes to look at what is happening. There are settings menus that exist but you can't see unless you keep hitting a move right button. If you start a series it will prompt you to buy a new car, even if you have one you can already use and can select

- Lack of content compared to previous games, seems to have fewer and fewer cars/tracks every new game there is. I know licensing is a thing to work with, but missing cars from companies still in the game? Ones that have been in previous games and just need an update? Or even worse, fictional tracks that were made just for the Forza series that aren't here. Worst of all, the simplest things to add more content are missing, like different track layouts? Why  in the world can't the one we have be raced in reverse? 

- Performance issues exist sporadically, but sometimes very severe. Only had happen a few times and was only for certain tracks, but framerate would be cut down to 1/3rd of normal

- Graphics are all over the place, regardless of settings. Sometimes it's nice and clear, other times a blurry over saturated mess. And you don't even have all the settings to fix it. Who thought ambient occlusion on moving windshield wipers was a good idea? Moving bright/dark stripes across the windshield is a bit distracting for racing. 

- The penalties system is trash for every situation, single and multiplayer. In single, you're better off running into opponents than getting 3 tires of the track only a half second penalty if anything. In multiplayer it's even worse, because those ""small"" bumps when you're racing will completely throw you off the track, and the person who did it gets away free, over and over. Huge collisions net you a few seconds penalty, which doesn't hurt at all if everyone else has to get back on the track 20 seconds behind. Temporary bans exist for a reason, should try using those. 

- Car XP and car points. You can have millions of credits to buy cars, but that means nothing for anything you buy new since they're completely separate. Gotta go drive that new one for an hour or more to be competitive in class or do what you want. It's only there so you spend more time playing the game. 

- Driver AI is brain dead stupid. At middle difficulty levels, you will get waves of brake checking opponents because they can't be too close to each other. If you ever get inside the on a corner they will throw themselves off the track instead of follow a wider line. And if you crank the difficulty up, they will just hit you on the same inside line instead of jumping into the wall for funsies. 

- Car performance index is often (but not always) broken for anything but straight power. You can add tire width, suspense, roll bars, chassis, bracing, brakes, aero components, and more without hardly any change to PI number, but as soon as you add 40 horsepower to that Miata it's going up by 100 points. 

- The multiplayer process is so drawn out you're better finding people yourself. 15 minutes of practice/qualifying before every race means you spend often twice as much time there as the race itself. And if you get one guy who sails into the group at the front to wreck everyone, start it all over. Just let us join in process races from the pits, it's much better to be doing something even if you don't ""win"" when you can be there right for the start of the next one. 

- Multiplayer races have everyone locked to the same framerate? In what world is the 10 milliseconds of difference between high and low framerate going to make a difference in a racing game? 

- There is no career ""progression"" in the normal sense, the difficulty is always just what you set it to. Why aren't ""certain"" drivers a little harder to show you getting closer and closer to their level? Or certain series more difficult because your in real race cars going against professionals? It would be so easy to add some player progression here, feeling like you were finally good enough to beat that harder series, but it's just a blank boring dial you can turn up or down. 
- Why is practice/qualifying completely unrelated to starting position? Sure you can move yourself back to make it more difficult, but if we're going to require the whole qualifying process anyway, at least make it worth something.

All in all, stay away. You're better off buying Assetto Corsa and spending time downloading nodded cars/tracks and making up your own ""career"" than playing Forza. Maybe one day they will just port Forza 3/4/5 and we can have what makes sense.",1701716708,1701716708,False,7,1,0.508174538612365723,0,True,False,False

Microsoft and Turn10 have shown without a shadow of a doubt to care much more for their investors then they ever would for their playerbase. The game is an ""engagement"" farm, beyond being anything resembling a game. It constantly bullies you into playing whatever weekly event is going on for that next big FOMO car. Better complete that series now, or you'll never have this unique mercedes with side skirts or whatever. After this it also demands you race whatever car your actually like for hundreds of laps to ""level it up"". If you don't do this, you'll never stand a chance in any sort of online event. People who have more time then you to play this game, will always win races. This game doesn't reward skill and racecraft. It rewards ""hours spent"" so turn10 can cash a paycheck.

What I'm trying to say is... This is a game that doesn't respect your time. If you're all at all a person who has a job, kids or other responsibilities, give this one a hard pass, and pick up something much more respecting of your time. Asetto Corsa with mods, or ACC with it's more professional track focussed realism gamplay have this game beat.

FM is indeed a good game, once you're on the track and forget about everything else. Nevertheless, I have decided to give a negative review, like many others, because Turn10 needs to know that this is not okay, and they need to change course. Something they haven't done so far, no self-criticism, everything's fine.

The good:

-Good driving model, fun, and a perfect simcade.
-Satisfactory car lineup.
-Satisfactory number of tracks.

The bad:

-Performance is disappointing.

The stupid:

-The career mode is pathetic. A very limited number of events, where often you can only select a handful of cars. This wouldn't be a problem if the number of events wasn't ridiculously low. Add more. I want to be flooded with events in the career, I want to always have something to do. What's the cost? Are you afraid we'll feel overwhelmed? Copy from Gran Turismo 1, released 20 years ago but infinitely superior to this mess you've created. Get rid of time-limited events in single-player. Is this an MMO mobile F2P? In multiplayer, they're fine, in the career, NO.
-Driving against the AI is extremely unsatisfying. Bots are not at all capable of overtaking but are extremely skilled at pushing you off the track! In the old days of the PS1, I played a lot of Destruction Derby, and I swear the bots were less infamous than these. Not only that, the bots are worse than the average human! With that said, considering the jerkiness of the average person, this is probably the biggest achievement reached by FM, congratulations!
-The penalty system is obscene: touch another car = 0.5 seconds penalty for you; someone rams into you for laughs = no penalty. The AI managing penalties is obscene, redo it.
-The new experience points system needed to buy car upgrades needs to be revised. Right now, it's stupid. At level 1, I can buy a RACE exhaust, but I have to wait until level 12 (!?) to apply a basic weight reduction. We're talking about removing the spare wheel and such trivialities. What's the point? Turn10, insanity at its finest!
-They introduced this experience points system to prevent players from buying 1000 cars and instead focus on a smaller number of cars. I'd be okay with it if I could do it. I'm drowning in cars I can't drive anywhere, except in Rivals! Unless I redo the OPEN tournament again and again, with 5-minute races... No, you want me to drive the cars you picked. Drop it. Let me play as I want!
-Before each race, you're forced to do a few laps... of practice, and then you can choose from which grid position to start. What is this madness? Since I'm forced to do laps, make it qualifying! And based on the times, the starting grid is chosen.
Given the stupidity of what was said in the previous point, the career offers rewards for simply completing a TOUR (a series of events). Come last? It doesn't matter, here's your prize. I can't think of anything more unsatisfying. It's a game of racing competitions, I have to earn the rewards, damn it!

There is still hope, because everything wrong with the game can be fixed. Let's see if it happen.

Every part of this game that is great is overshadowed by deeper flaws that outweigh their benefits in its current state.  Here are some of things I think about nearly every time I play the game:

The Graphics -- They are beautiful.  I've lost races over staring at water droplets streaming off of wiper blades, the beautiful backdrops of the racetracks, or the hypnotizing glow of brake lights through a distant fog.  I've also lost races because the racetrack itself literally disappears in mid race.  Though I've been fortunate that occurrence of the issue has been minor for me, many others are not as lucky.

The tracks and cars -- I wish there was a nordschleife, I have heard it is coming, but unlike past Forza's where I had favorite circuits I have found that almost every circuit has something wonderful to look forward to driving on.  The latest ""Yas Marina"" is particularly well done, especially at night.
The car selection is outstanding, I have not found much to complain about.  Kind of surprised there is no Elantra N, and there are some little things that are disappointing, for example, only vehicles with digital gauge clusters have working odometers, older cars with analog odometers do not meter the miles you've raced.  The R34 skyline has no central screen with information. A couple cars had needles that do not illuminate at night and are impossible to see.  Roll cages sometimes do weird things like remove A pillars or the roof.   Putting a widebody on the 350z removes the exhaust tips from the model.  Damage is weird, there is no more indication of engine and drive line damage, only suspension and brakes.  You can damage the engine and drive line, you just do not get any status indicators.  No amount of bumper-cars will affect light output of headlights or taillights which is disappointing but not a priority.

The Physics 
In general -- They mostly feel right -- mostly.  Every car is a blast to drive.  Handling is superb, you can feel differences in track, limits in grip, and nearly everything has customization whether you are on a wheel or controller.  With a basic wheel setup I feel like I'm at the track.  Except brakes.  I am convinced whoever programmed the braking system has never actually pressed a brake pedal on a moving car.  Seriously, the game is impossible to play without ABS.  Less than 20% brake pressure and you are still just a sled.  
Nearly every upgrade provides a noticeable impact on your vehicle, aerodynamics make a very noticeable difference so I can finally justify ""giant wing on everything"" and I especially love the indirect additions, such as an exhaust adding flames and pops, intakes adding induction noise, and upgraded turbos providing all the lovely noises that turbos generate.

Transmissions -- This gets its own section because Holy. Shit.  Using a wheel setup with an H pattern shifter and a clutch pedal, with the game set to manual + clutch.  As far as I can tell, the thought was ""let's make upgraded transmissions reduce shift times.""  Ok, but in order to feel a shorter shift time, you need to start from a longer shift time in the first place.  See where this is going?  I've owned at least 4 vehicles in real life that are also in game, and each and every vehicle in the game with a stock transmission requires about a 2 second gear throw in order to shift properly.  Slammed into second and dumped the clutch?  Nope, your 94hp miata's clutch is slipping while the game punishes you for attempting to shift faster than the abstract setting of the shift speed.  Wanna dump some momentum into a downshift while you turn?  Not happening, you are just rowing through neutrals.  Seriously, nothing feels like a real car. when it is in stock form.  Clutch upgrades do not address the issue, the only solution is to upgrade the transmission. (I hope you unlocked that and saved enough points).  In order to get a transmission that can keep up with your real-life shift movements you MUST upgrade to the ""race"" transmission.  This wouldn't be so inconvenient but the dog gear whine is annoying when you just want your in game transmission to feel remotely 1:1 with what you are doing with your controller.  Oh, and the race transmission seems to be sequential transmission, so if you upgrade to it, you actually no longer need the clutch at all.  So to summarize the circular logic: you set the game to use a clutch and then you upgrade the transmission so that it can keep up with your controller but that also removes the need for the clutch.  Although you can choose to use it still, it is just purely for role-play purposes.

Tires and fuel -- A standard addition to any race game, however I love the weight saving/time reduction of running less fuel versus running more for safety and weight distribution.  Tires, when upgraded, can be selected for Hard, medium and soft.
But,  in single player, you never come close to wearing out soft tires.  Seriously, I cannot fathom a reason to not run soft except in the rain.  There is a wear system, but the tires wear slowly and even 5-6 laps are not enough to even start wearing them.
Unless you are online.  If you race online, the wear and fuel use system changes completely, so in case you practiced in single player almost none of the experience and muscle memory will translate.  Soft tires will wear out in a couple of laps.  Fuel drains faster.  You cannot set the difficulty to mirror online wear in single player to practice with.

The Career --  Gone are the endless tours from early Forza titles. There are only about 6-8 tours to choose from.  Some of them are revolving on a seemingly monthly basis, but there are just not a lot of unique races that will give you a chance to drive your favorite cars in various races, only over and over again in a select few races or in free play.  Being able to race career tours cooperatively or even competitively with friends would really spice this up, but no such feature exists.

The AI -- Awful.  Seriously, these guys will come off a superior line just to bump you.  Even in practice, they seem to be programmed to be aggressive.  Navigating a clean pass is a chore.  I cannot tell if this is an attempt to add like a ""blocking"" mechanic, or just to make the game artificially harder, but it is just a nightmare, especially on a wet track where the AI appears to have far more grip and superior weight no matter the circumstance, they will yeet you from the track at 120mph and still stay on track.

I do not believe the game is sustainable in its current state.  Maybe I would recommend it on a sale/discount, but without some polish this game is a disappointment.",1701489902,1701489902,False,4,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False

Forza Motorsport is a sim-cade racing game which mixes simulation aspects of racing and forces you to improve your skills while balancing that “gamey” feeling of fun arcade games.

So lets start with content. And this game has a lot of content. First you have a career mode where you pick a car from the list and race against AI. New career races are being added constantly so you're never bored. There's something for everyone's taste. German, Japanese, Italian series, slow cars, fast cars – anything you want.
I'm also gonna state the obvious here because some people are not very smart – this is not Horizon on circuits. It's closer to simulation than arcade which means you're supposed to race or keep hotlapping on the same track and car for hours to improve your skills.

I love the “gamey' rpg aspect of the game where you level up the cars to unlock upgrades. It's done pretty quickly and forces you drive the car and get to know it, adapt to it at the same time making you learn the tracks.
You modify your cars as much as you like, you're given absolute freedom to apply any modification. Maybe one variant will be better for one track and another for a different track.
Then obviously you have tuning where you can tune the cars which can transform the handling. Default tunes are pretty bad, well ok, they're really bad. It can put people off but after adjusting it the cars feel great.
Selection of cars is amazing and more will be added. I love driving simple road cars and learn them. Each car feels different and requires time to adjust.

Physics seem pretty good and makes your driving experience dynamic. One small mistake and you lose your precious time. Each car is different and it's reflected through physics, ffb and handling. This aspect of the game is what pushes the game more towards the threshold between sim-cade and a sim. Although don't expect pure sim here. Forza always was a competitor to Gran Turismo and that game is the definition of sim-cades. It's all about having fun while having realistic experience.

There's also multiplayer with few modes. After finishing the entry race in mutliplayer you're given your safety rating and skill rating and then you can enter other races and test your skills against others. The tracks are on rotation, wait time most of the time is perfect (around 10-20 minutes) which leaves enough time to do few practice laps and qualify. You can choose to race in the same class of cars or open class, again lots of choice here.
Negative side of mutliplayer is always the gap between skill levels and penalty system. While the gap can be solved only by having more people play the game (since matchmaking works better with more people) so it's not game's fault, the penalty system could use a lot of improvements. Very often people are not being penalized for ramming others. Or if they're penalized it's only 0,5s penalty or something similar. And sometimes someone crashes into you and you get a penalty. So it definitely needs some tuning.
People not knowing the rules of racing and trying to block you when you're overtaking them also isn't the game's fault so no point talking about that.
Safety rating is a joke. It's so easy to improve it that you can have few penalties in the race and still jump up from B to A. It must be stricter and getting to S should take at least 10-15 clean races, not 1 or 2.

Biggest downside is the AI. While AI is dynamic and each time drives differently (try to rewind and you'll see that AI behaves slightly differently) it's very dumb. AI will ram you, push you, punish you for nothing. Even if you try to stay away from them they'll find a way to push you. But one interesting thing is that AI behaves differently from race to race. I had some clean races where AI rather goes off track than into me, they try to stay away from contact and brake or go on the outside. So it's very weird.

Force feedback is pretty good but you'll need to adjust it to find that sweet spot. Default settings are garbage.

Graphically the game looks good but has some visual bugs in replays. It's not a graphical masterpiece but in general it looks great. Especially if you pay attention to small details like reflections.
Graphics settings are confusing and leads to performance issues if you don't know what they do. It's as if developers intentionally want to confuse people. But once you figure it out the game runs smoothly without any issues.
Running the game on max settings with ray tracing and dlss on 7800x3d, rtx4080, 32GB 6000mhz @3440x1440 and having a great time. Although dlss doesn't change much. Also can confirm the game runs fine on rtx2060&3700x and rtx2080ti&3900x. Optimization is decent considering the graphics and physics in the background but it could be better. But it's rare for the game running smoothly without dlss these days.

Sadly only partial ultrawide support (not in the menu and photo mode). There's a fix but obviously it could be risky to use in multiplayer so it would great if developers fix that. No ultrawide support in 2023 is poathetic.

Now is it built from the grounds up? I never played previous games but it doesn't feel like it's built from the grounds up. Maybe some parts of it but definitely not everything.

Sound design is amazing. Cars sound fantastic and you almost can smell them. Sound effects are are great. But! Collision sound is absolutely terrible. When you barely touch another car the noise is as if you hit a huge barrel and your car gonna explode. Just what the actual...?

This is very good racing game for those who don't want to commit to serious sim-racing but still want to have a realistic experience and learn to race. Great selection of cars, plenty of single player content, featured content, constant content updates, customization options, pretty deep simulation of physics and ffb for a sim-cade and fun multiplayer makes it worth buying.

I even waited a week to see if a graphics driver update (or you would think maybe a patch!?) would come along and resolve the problem. But it still hasn't, so I'm barely able to get in one decent practice session without the game screwing up.

As a dedicated fan of both gaming and automotives, I had high expectations for this installment in the series, but unfortunately, it fell short in several key areas.

First and foremost, the gameplay mechanics seem to have taken a step backward. The controls feel clunky and unresponsive at times, detracting from the immersive racing experience that the Forza series is known for. It's disheartening to witness a regression in a fundamental aspect that has always been a strong suit for the franchise.

Moreover, the graphics, while generally impressive, exhibit occasional glitches and inconsistencies that disrupt the visual appeal. For a game that prides itself on realism, these graphical hiccups detract significantly from the overall immersion and enjoyment.

The online multiplayer functionality, touted as a major highlight, has been plagued by connectivity issues. Whether it's frequent lag or server disconnections, attempting to engage in multiplayer races has become a frustrating endeavor rather than an enjoyable competition.

In conclusion, Forza Motorsport has left me disappointed and questioning the direction the series is heading. I sincerely hope that future updates or patches address these concerns.",1700096077,1701376317,False,2,0,0.5004730224609375,0,True,False,False

I only picked up the game yesterday, so it's possible some patches have addressed the issues, but I'm seeing good FPS, no drops mid-race and no missing textures as reported. The performance and systems are as follows:

High-End, 66 FPS average at max settings including Ray Tracing, DLSS OFF, at 4K: RTX 3090, i9 14900K (5.8GHz all-core), 64GB DDR5 @6400MHZ CL30, 990 Pro NVME SSD, Z690 Aorus Master

Mid Range, 61 FPS average, ray tracing on, DLSS Quality Mode, all settings maxed except for RTAO at high instead of ultra, at 4K: RTX 4070, i5 12400, 32GB DDR5 @5600MHz CL28, 990 Pro NVME SSD, B660 Aorus Pro

Performance aside, the game is pretty solid. EXCEPT FOR THE BUMPING!!!!! The other reviewers have it right. It can be a total bump-fest and it's complete BS. Something needs to be done balancing-wise to fix it, I'm just not sure what. Maybe just don't penalize the person being bumped if they go off track? Add larger penalties to the person (or AI) doing the bumping? Maybe each bump scales the penalty?

Every time I start the game, I have to go select my controls preset, it doesn't save. About 1 in 7 races, the track and ground disappears - which is an important feature of a racing game. The AI was cut straight from GTA5. Why on earth does the computer swerve to ram my door as I pass them doing 15mph more on a straight? Online racing is nonexistent. It's just bumper cars. To say that the car upgrade system is a grind is an understatement. New words need to be invented to convey  what a horrible system it is. 

The driving physics are the only redeeming part. They're great, which really only highlights how terrible everything else is. I haven't been let down by a game this much in a very long time.",1701357213,1701357213,False,1,0,0.47728458046913147,0,True,False,False

PROS
- works well with G923 incl. shift knob if you use the right settings
- good graphics with dynamic weather and time of day. I am getting 60fps with all settings on ultra but i have ray tracing turned off
- decent selection of cars (similar to forza horizon but it doesnt have as many)
- decent AI

CONS
- not open world
- becomes repetitive after awhile
- car upgrades available based on how much you drive a car (i have mixed feelings about this)
- everything is basically circuit racing. There are no sprints or drags that i have come across yet in the 37 hours i have played
- my i7 7700k ""isnt a supported CPU"" and a box pops up when you start up the game giving you the option to ignore. Luckily the game seems to run well with my quad core - cant speak for others with ""unsupported cpus""
- they made anti aliasing a built in setting so the game is naturally blurry no matter what resolution you set the game to. The trick that i found is to change the resolution scale to 145% and it gets rid of the blurriness - and i am still getting 60fps


The biggest reason i really like this game is because of the support for the g923 and the shift knob. With the correct settings and some practice it is a fantastic combo. I can get close to realism with the first person driver view when using my shift knob or paddle shifters - combine that with the decent graphics and i find the game enjoyable.

Coming from Sims like AC, ACC and the F1 Franchise, this game is light years away from these titles. I'll put aside the graphic issues (because they can be fixed and optimized in future patches), and focus more on the driving experience.

- Default FFB needs to be tuned depending on your wheel model, but the game seems to forget your last configuration and you have to reconfigure every time you open the game. 
- The setup/tuning menu. Seems like the development team never did a research on how those inputs work. Brake bias is inverted. In the aero screen you have values from 0 to 120 (Porsche Cayman) but no units at all. Just a random slider that sometimes seems to do nothing.

- Most of the cars have tons of oversteer until you buy the correct parts (this may not be so bad, but when you want to do quick races, you have to BUY the car and grind like crazy otherwise the game won't let you do setups, and the grind is really annoying)

- Loading screens times and unnecessary cinematics, make this game feel like an arcade instead of a serious racing game (I wasn't expecting a harbored sim, but this waste of time really bothers me)

- Some tracks are weird and not properly traced the way they suppose to be.

- Matchmaking is horrendous and the adaptation AI they promise is not really that adaptation (or maybe the community is playing this badly).

- One terrible aspect of the game. Ni prsctice and Qualy sessions for private lobbies. This makes this game more like a ""just drive"" game than a properly racing game. 

Hope some issues get fixed and the developers hear us out, because this is not the content we deserve when buying a triple A game for more than $70 bucks.

Still, you can have some fun if you have friends around that know how to race (this is my case, and bought it only for that reason)

If I were you, I would expect for the game to be in a better state and maybe a good sale.",1701161677,1701316654,False,4,0,0.525921821594238281,0,True,False,False

It boggles the mind that this game took 6 years to produce with so little to show. I enjoy the driving but career mode is so boring with AI thats just as bad as it's always been. 

Multiplayer is a crashfest with a wacked penalty system that does jack all to fix the dirty racing. The skill and safety rating system just seems not to work at all. I'm ranked S and all mp races are nothing but destruction derbies. 

To top it all off you have to grind XP just so you can upgrade your cars. If you have only an hour to play on any given night you're going to be left deciding if you should spend that time grinding xp for cars you want to upgrade or just drive in non competitive cars. Great options!!

- Performance is okay now, tho I have a RTX-3090 I would hope so. 
- I can actualy play the game without crashing every two race.
- Most feature are... bug free is pushing it... it's playable without major gameplay bug.
- I'm not sure if it's the update or just my imagination, but rain feels more impactfull.


What's yet to fix :
- Still ugly as a PS4 Game
- Models are of very inconsistent quality, and often worse than is previous Motorsport titles
- AI still eats rocks and rear ends you or T-bone you from breaking too late
- The grinding system is still a pile of garbage
- Multiplayer safety rating and penalty system need a rework

Yeah that's about it. honestly, it's not worth 70$ or whatever they are charging in your country. If you see it on sale, sure. it's okay for 40$. Otherwise, get Grand Tourismo 7 if you own a PS5 or ... idk Aseto Corsa for PC?
The probleme with this piece of garbage is that it's the only controler focused, somewhat realistic racing game. go Torent F1 23, I heard it's good. Spend 4k$ on a simracing rig to go iRacing... idk just don't buy that at full price.

(updated)- with new patch, they have helped out the performance issues most people were having. i feel after playing the game more i understand more of it (clearly) and it makes playing the game more enjoyable. in future updates i hope to better improvements! cheers to racing 
Can't fully rec the game at this moment. i know i have only 2 hours played, but at least 40 minutes of that was spent trying to get my settings correct. i can run numerous games at 4k 100fps, this game i have to dumb down the graphics to even achieve that on 2k. speaking of graphics do not let the trailers fool you, the in game looks very odd/low end. ray tracing and all that enabled doesn't give the game justice like other games.
The game feels okay, feels more arcady than other sims but definitely not terrible.
Get it for game pass until it lowers the price because id expect this many issues with a 3rd party company, not Forza titles....btw fh5 has better graphics and that is kinda sad seeming this game was ""built from the ground up""",1697308298,1701043204,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overtake 6 cars from side easily at the start as everyone crashes with each other on the first turn.
Then the guy behind you crashes into you, back to 12th. 1.5 seconds penalty to you for off track.
Then the guy in front of you doesn't like you overtaking him and bumps you off track, to 20th, 3 seconds penalty to you for off track.
Then the guy behind you crashes into you by mistake, he stops and lets you go, then the guy behind him crashes into you.
Now you are last. Well peace finally?
Nah the guy in front of you goes off track then crashes into you on the next turn.
Rinse and repeat.
S safety rating btw.

Meh

1) Graphics are real bad. Even when maxed a game from 5 years ago looks better. 
2) Graphics are bugged. Half of the time you drive on a non existing racetrack. Or your car interior is just gone. 
3) Ray tracing is non existent. 
4) Top of the line graphics cards can barely push 70-80 fps. 
5) Sound is horrible. Sounds like vacuum cleaners. 
6) Updates dont solve fundamental issues with the game. 
7) AI is just bad. First place will drive off posting insane lap time untill you catch up and then you gain 1-2 seconds easy. They told us no rubber banding or ""cheat ai"". This is just not true. 
8) From the ground up my ass. Car models are worse then before. 
9) Game crashes are frequent. 
10) Tire physics is non existent. They just took previous model and added more understeer in every car. 
11) penalty system is a joke. You crash full on into somebody and no penalty. Slightly slide out of the lines 2 sec penalty. Ridiculous. 
12) Multiplayer is just destruction derby. Not worth playing ever unless you like to run people of the road. 

Take my advice and don't spent any money like i did. Worthtless game from a sadly to say now worhtless studio. Turn 10 should now better.

I haven't experienced any major performance issues (playing at 4K 60fps w/ 7950X3D & RTX 4090) on Ultra settings with RT on. I've never once dipped below 60fps and I've been playing since early access day one. There were few minor texture bugs here and there but nothing too serious.

My biggest issue with the game is BORING campaign, NOT ENOUGH tracks and the whole leveling up system which is an ABSOLUTE PILE OF ****!!! Leveling up cars entirely ruins the game for me without being able to mod cars, swap engines, swap drivetrains until you grind endlessly and by that point you want to drive something else. Also! Not being able to buy car upgrades with regular game credits just adds to the list of negatives.
All the changes made for FM 2023 are for the worst. Old system worked great and most FM player base enjoyed it. Improving old system would have been the proper way to go about it. Instead it seems as if Turn 10 took all their worst ideas and made the game based on them. Devs need to listen to community and make the necessary changes to improve the entire game experience.

The only positive thing about the entire game is physics which in my opinion is on point.

However, there are some minor things I don't like..

-Depending on what PC you have, you'll have to tweak the settings to make it run better.
-Minor details that go a long way in the car community are either forgotten or the devs don't care. An example is the 1973 Pontiac Trans Am, the rims and factory colors on the decals are wrong. It's cool to see classics but get them right from factory. We can always tune and change them afterwards.
-Missing some cars that should probably be in the game, like a 2011 Mitsubishi Eclipse GTP, maybe it will be in a DLC later on that we have to pay for (insert eye roll).
-Character customization- you put it in and them limit it to different presets. Why? Let us have some fun and pic different racing suites, helmets, gloves, shoes, etc. AND different visor tint, and colors for everything. A cool feature missed in my opinion.
-While viewing the car, you can't open the hood or trunk. We could do that 10 years ago...

Yes the game has/had its problems and bugs at the start but lets be honest which ""big"" titel in the last years didnt ?

They listen to the community and reduces the grind to get all tuning parts for the cars, i personaly like the idea of leveling the cars up. Due my age i cant remember which racing game it was (one of the early Forza´s or Grand Tourismos on console) where you leveled up your cars and got better contracts (more money for racing) and prototype parts for tuning.

Positive in this version of the game is all the SUV´s. Pickup-Trucks, Stretch Limo´s and other stuff like that where dropped and the focus went to cars more fitting such a game. Dont get me wrong but all the car types listet which where dropped fit way better into Horizon.

With the actual plan the game will see a long time service with new racing events, new tracks and cars and over the time (yes talking years now, patience yound padawan) this might become one of the best racing games.

Sound and graphics are really ok and let you play without being laggy.

One downside for sure i the AI of the npc cars, specialy in the first corner of a race one might think you bootet up Wreckfest instead of Forza, but who knows there might come patches for this issue too.

• Game launched with a save bug which resets progress. It has been fixed, but it took T10 an entire month to fix.

• Game launched with several infinite loading screen bugs. These have been fixed, but it took T10 an entire month to fix them.

• Dirty air reduces the downforce of car with [b]clean[/b] air. This has been mostly mitigated, but is still present in the game.

• Currently (Nov 2023), DLSS is bugged. It randomly turns off and disappears from the settings. With the terrible optimization this game has DLSS is a must, and without it I'm facing severe stuttering issues. With their track record, it will be fixed after a month.

• The upgrade system is a massive let down. The game loop of sitting in a new car with no upgrade while opponents/AI have race tires is just not fun.

• Newly added Yas Marina induces severe frame drops. Other tracks run fine, so it is a problem specific to Yas Marina.

• Multiplayer skill and safety ratings are pointless because they aren't factored in when lobbies are created.

Game is lots of fun but has bugs. 
Believe it or not, what makes it fun is the Ratings system. How you drive and if you bump into each other will give you a rating (S,A,B,C,D,E) and match you accordingly with other plebs. It makes the game a completely different experience on S rating match, or on a B match. Can't even imagine what it will be on an E race. Probably something similar to FH5 race.
Price is steep, but there's always gamepass.
If you are a hardcore racing fan, wait till Steam Christmas sales so you'll get it cheaper, and with several bugs fixed.
While this game definitely isn't Project Cars 2, I strongly suggest it especially with friends.

EDIT: ANY MATCH BELOW B RANK IS TRASH COMPETITION. BEWARE!

While the game is better now than it was at launch it still feels flat in comparison to past games. The car leveling systems level grind that I mentioned in my first review has been cut literally in half. Now most all upgrades are obtained by car level 25 rather than 50. The campaign is short, I have already completed it and i now feel that there is nothing left to do. Online multiplayer still isn't fun. There still doesn't feel like there is enough racing. The same problem still persists, you spend over 20 minutes prepping to enter and place for a race only for it to go south and feel that you have waited your time.  The game needs an in and out online mode. The only fun i have with this game anymore is private online with friends.  IMO Forza Motorsport feel as if it has fallen victim to what so many games today have. 
Player retention > Fun.






This game provides some of the best physics i have ever seen in a car game. The car list is good although i cant understand why all SUV's and trucks have been removed. The car progression system is [b] GARBAGE [/b]. Having a game tell me what i can and can't do with my money is stupid. Rewarding the player with credits is almost pointless anymore because car upgrades are now purchased with car points that are only unlocked by driving the car. This now means the days sitting on the couch and building overpowered dream cars with your friends are gone. In my experience it takes 3-4 hours to get a car to the max level of 50. Car level also does not carry over if you have multiple of the same car. If you buy two mustangs one for track one for drag each one will have to leveled up independently 6-8 hours. Online multiplayer is a massive time sink and not in a good way, you spend more time practicing and quailing than actually racing. From what i have experienced most people end up pilled up in the first corner and mad the rest of the race because it took the nearly 15 minutes just to get into a race that they now no longer have any hope of being competitive in. I miss the days in Forza where it felt like you could ""run what you brung"". Back when you could actually have a career/connection with a car. Now it feels like your given everything and are being forced to play with cars you don't care about so that you can get to the ones you do. I wish Turn10 hadn't tried to reinvent the wheel with this because they have failed. The economy in this game feel like that of a free to play, where the only source of progression is an egregious amount of time in game. At lease in past Forza titles time would reward the player with credits they could then use to there hearts desire, now it just feels like a waste of time but then again what AAA isn't nowadays.",1697340134,1700736732,False,4,1,0.533515691757202148,0,True,False,False

But OMG get the multiplayer aspect needs to be sorted , you have people waiting for the race to start and then all of a sudden it crashes. You essentially waste 20-30 minutes trying to get a race and then it gets ruined my network issues and random game crashes. The video optimisation for this game is PATHETIC , my 3070 cannot render this game at 2k without running DLSS at performance . Its absolutely hilarious that a 2 year old gpu is an absolute paper weight in this day and age. They have added a lot of environmental features which really is not FUCKING NEEDED in A FUCKING RACING GAME. other than those issues ALSO the car upgrade system , I get they are trying to do built and not bought , but this methodology fucking sucks. Forza 7 had a beautiful campaign list and worked so well in certain cases. BUT these guys chose to focus on the environmental details. fix your multiplayer system as well as the car balance , some cars are just to over powered in certain spec class due to the upgrade and some cars just are bulldozers and sweep everyone clean into turn 1.

Also the practice session in multiplayer , LET THE DRIVERS CHANGE THE FUEL LOAD for QUALIFICATION runs as well as the tyre choice , you need to pit and that takes 30 seconds where you ruin your tyres and add excess fuel . Come up with a better solution or do what codemaster does , there is no shame in using a system that works . DONT reinvent something or use a feature that reduces the sport's value . Also your cars feel like trucks while accelerating , what have you guys done to the cars is beyond my understanding . fix your first person POV as well , it feels as if my face is stuck to wheel at all times , give the players the freedom to position the camera for each car at least .

______________________________________________
My opinion after initial 20 hours playing the game:

Positive and great things:

   - Best driving in any Forza Motorsport ever, far superior than previous one and much more closer to a serious simracer. Great in track feelings (I play on wheel only).
   - Great FFB even with my humble G29, I’ve just increased and touched some settings as it was a bit bland by default.
   - Visually speaking I love how it looks and the realistic lighting, even that the PC version is totally mess in settings and performance.
   - The level of detail in every circuit is astonishing and far superior to any other racing game IMHO.
   - Track dynamics feel great
   - Featured online is AWESOME!! Finally we got serious racing including pit strategy, tyre compound and practice+qualyfing sessions. Best game mode in any Forza ever. Please even if you add custom lobbies, keep these as they are now.
   - Time attack and rivals mode are great especially with the great driving physics.

Mixed bag things:

   - Progression system feels artificial and a barrier to simply put more hours in the game. I dont mind to put 3 hours on rivals to level up a car and custom it the way I like it, but I understand that people complain about it.
   - Sound effects sometimes are great but there is some flaws aswell like the VTEC Honda engines that sounds terrible.
   - Penalty system should be more strict, even that for the launch it is decent, I expected something worse. Better than FM7 FRR

Negative things and issues that have to be fixe ASAP:

   - AI is just terrible. No competition feeling anywhere, they don’t know even how to drive close and quick to another car.

   - 60fps cap multiplayer is like an insult for PC players

   - Replay system is dreadful. we cannot see even in which lap the replay is going on, no timeline, no options, nothing. And multiplayer replays are bugged and I cannot reproduce them

   - Always online game is something definitely bad

   - It’s buggy and it looks like there has been no testing period in lots of minor(and some major) things

   - Recycled Xbox360 models: E30, E92, Golf II, Sivia, etc.

   - Lack of assists granularity, on TC, ABS, this should be possible specially on GT cars

   - Missing auction house, it’s like a mini-game that provides great fun

   - It is TERRIBLE that we cannot select Km/h and hp as measure units, in Europe we use that!!! I don’t know what means the power of a car in KW. This is possible in Forza Horizon since long time ago and it is just lazyness from T10

   - Where are the STATISTICS? Races played, podiums, pole positions, distances covered in total and by car, safety and skill ratings improvement or decreased after every ranked race… there is nothing!!!

I miss a roadmap from T10 apart from we’re gonna deliver this track in this date, we need to know which are the features they are working on and which are the plans in the short term for the game

For the love of everything. Wait a year and a half at least to see if they actually add the baseline day one content you are probably expecting it to have instead of getting it and trying to cope with such a hefty hunk of money for something so anemic. 
Physics are the best they've ever been, would be weird if they weren't. Controller has a 25% deadzone on steering by default which is absolutely hilarious. Wheels have 5% on default, which is wrong. 
The singleplayer might as well be one of their traditional 'DEMO's in length. Its about 20 hours to beat the whole game in singleplayer without making your own fun in freeplay. Which I think is what they expect you to do. Despite having less options than ever in freeplay and not showing you the layout or pictures from the track you're selecting. Hope you know your tracks. Theres also NO, and I mean ZERO, singleplayer tours with actual track racecars. Its hilarious and insulting at the same time.
CarPG rips the Forza customization out of the average players hands. Has to be changed and likely will at some point. Economy is still hilariously poor despite removing random rewards. 

Want an authentic track experience? Get PC2 on a keyseller.
Want to mess around on tracks with some cars? Get Horizon 5 and go play on custom made tracks with your favorite cars. 
Save your money, Economy is getting tighter every day. Its worth less every day. It'll probably be on the upswing by the time this game gets enough content or work to be recommendable, If they actually get to that point.

2 Major 'updates' later edit: 
I would be absolutely ashamed of this project if I had worked on it. I wouldn't want anyone to know. I personally would have quit before this disaster was put in players hands. But 2 updates now and they've effectively fixed nothing. The 2.0 update has broken more things then its fixed, and the list of fixes arent even true. Nearly all of them are still issues. As far as we the consumers know. There might as well be one person working on this game now. Nothing has been done. The newest 'GAAS' cycle of content is giving us access to a BRAND NEW Sesto Elemento, No wait, Thats the same one from Forza Motorsport 4. So the game desperate for new content is getting recycled content. While Forza Horizon has gotten a metric ton of new cars in the past 6 months, most of which, are race spec cars, that have no good reason why they shouldnt be in this game. The performance is the same as day 1, still an absolute dog to run on year old enthusiast grade hardware. Lovely buttery smooth 38fps with dropped frames all over the place with no RT at 1440p.

Its pathetic. It feels gross. This SHOULD be the death of this franchise. The one I've invested 15+ years in. I feel not an ounce of sympathy for the devs. I don't feel like we are beta testers for a rushed game. I feel like we were scammed dirty with a minimum viable product that will be (and probably should be) abandoned in 18 months.",1696911957,1700622391,False,441,10,0.850959897041320801,28,True,False,False

They slam you onto the grass, straight up don´t break before corners ramming into your rear bumper and drive like you don´t exist overall.

Do not listen to the haters of Forza Motorsport that rated this game poorly because this game is actually a very good game that is worth the $69.99 in order to be able to buy this game without DLC. The Forza games are worth it on PC, and I strongly recommend a xbox controller, a playstation controller, or a racing wheel because PC games that involve driving cars are hard on a computer mouse and keyboard.

TL;DR: if you like racing games, then you should buy this game and play it on your gaming PC. Also, do not forget to check the system requirements to make sure that your pc can run this game.

        🎮 Graphic settings info: Dynamic Render Quality defines at what resolution your game is rendered at, not displayed! Low=720p, Mid=1080p, High=1440p and Ultra=2160p
As someone who has hit 4990+ Elo in multiplayer with S rating, I'd say I've had my fair share of MP-gameplay exp. which is where this game shines the most in my honest opinion.
🔴 Negatives upfront...
The ""Career mode"" is atrocious! Reason being, you always drive in open class (A, B, C, S or R etc.) and  never use actual race cars, in a game with the name ""Motorsport"" it's quite comical. The car leveling system is an absolute joke, forcing you to either have the game auto-drive you through 40 laps of LeMans, to have all upgrades, or having no upgradeability at all. The replay system is completely broken and bricks not only the FPS of the game, but ignores all types of physics. The graphics in this game are not that bad but it lacks quite in sharpness and I dont understand how on earth it can stutter so much (AMD R7 5800X3D + RTX 4090, only NVME drives and 32GB RAM on 3440x1440). The car list is also kind of a joke, many re-used models from previous games. Lacking important LeMans Hypercars, F1 car in general or at least more GT-Endurance/WEC cars. It's a motorsport racing game...
It has drift and drag tires but lacks those events completely...wtf?!
In my opinion there are very important tracks missing. Where is Monza? What about Le Castellet? Hermanos Rodriguez? Baku, Jeddah, the list goes on...
⚪️ Neutral points...
The new penalty system is not perfect but for my experience it hasnt been that bad. I know, I've seen Youtube videos where it has penalised the wrong person! It happened once so far with me...but apparently it is constantly learning.
Online races have to little variety in terms of tracks.
I havent raced a single time in Suzuka, Catalunya or Silverstone. But this might just be a thing that will be fixed in the future, hence the neutral point.
Car Sounds are mostly fine but some of them are absolutely wrong. Good example is how good the Nissan Skyline Bluebird #20 sounds.
Bad example: Mercedes Sauber W140
Races/Events are always starting on a specific time and not behind a queueing system, which is positive for me but might be negative for others. That's why I've decided to leave it as a neutral point. There are plenty of events starting each 10min, so you'll find enough to play.
Free practice starts at 40min.
🟢Positives last...
The upgrade system becomes completely useless if you decide to race online in classed races. Touring cars, Forza GT, Forza GTX (IMSA GTO cars) class have all pre-defined upgrades for each car. No matter your level, the car is forced to use those upgrades and you can freely customise the setup (Tire pressure, camber etc.) Thus I recommend to avoid open class online racing, cause the advantages are insane. The three classes I mentioned are only examples, there are much more!
Lets be honest here, this point wouldnt exist if the leveling system wouldnt be there in the first place, but what ever.
You need to do placement races, where everyone drives the same car (setup can be done still) and this is an amazing thing. It has fair circumstances and gives an estimate of your safety rating and elo.
Speaking of which, the safety system + elo is amazing. I've had amazing races with even some of the devs. Seriously, the racing in this game does not compare to the shameful rammers of FM7! 
Online races have Free practice and Qualifying, I cannot state how much I love this. Driving and adjusting your setup can be done on the fly. Changing car just requires you to back out of free practice. You can even change your car after qualifying with a different car. Make sure to change to soft tires/low fuel before qualifying. This can make up to +2s per lap.
Apparently Wheel is as fast as controller, I personally play on Xbox Elite Series 2, so I cant speak for wheel support/settings. [hr][/hr]
All in all do I recommend the game? It depends. If you're in for an alternative to Gran Turismo which exists on PC, then certainly. Just be aware that this game shines most in online play.
Are you looking for a solo play experience? Honestly, no...the AI is apparently still a mess. I used the option to turn all singleplayer races into Ghost-mode races, so I can avoid racing the AI. The game's included in the Xbox game pass, which you can get for 1€...give it a try and decide for yourself. I will definitely continue playing the amazing Multiplayer, with hopefully more track variety.
Sidenote: you can queue as a group and play online just fine, which is pretty cool. Yes private races exist and they dont count towards your rating!
Would be nice to have some Team events constisting of 2 drivers per team with 12 teams on the grid.
Hope it gave you a little insight about FM 2023. See you around racers, race fair and avoid the shadow realm!🎮

Update 2.0:
Many issues are still not fixed, they released a track (Yas Marina) to us without announcement. So I assume it was some sort of excuse. Syncing Vinyls still do not work, the game has a lot of issues still.

Theres also the issue that the roads don't even show when racing the texture popping or assests being invisible then loading in for around 10 seconds and then dissapearing is ridiculous. the game honeslty feels like its a beta and not even optimised.

And this time, I will actually recommand it as I played it double the amount of hours in a week than in a month as the applying upgrade infinite loading screen bug is finally fixed and it did not crash since and it's been a real treat ! 

I've even tried multiplayer for the first time and it's been fun and I've been enjoying it ! So far I have S rating in safety and 4,3k skill so I'm happy so far with it. But there are not a lot of choices of races and I don't know when most of them are updated.

On my previous review, I complained about the AI which is still valid on this patch which will be the quote below. And I will expand on some solutions I've found.

""The AI :
- This is so unbelievably disgusting and needs to be fixed as soon as possible and makes the game little as no fun. I will say at first that compared to GT, FM actually tries to have a competitive AI and adjustable difficulties. Having played from GT3 to GT6 with no such things, in term of race intensity in GT for singleplayer is non-existant and is boring to play after a while. With that out of the way, let's get back to FM AI. 

- I will share its strongest point though : On a similar pace and when attempting to make moves, the AI actually leaves you space and fights (not so much) next to you. Sadly a good amount of time, the AI just don't take the space you left for them and just goes offtrack or slows down significantly. And that is pretty much it regarding good aspects of the AI.

- AI and PI points... My god I've never seen something so unrelated and that makes no sense. First of, why are AI cars using custom liveries and has racing kit already installed with modified tire compound on the first race of any cup while you're stuck on a 300 Upgrade points stock car ? You finished two races, you upgrade from 530 PI to 580 PI, you check the drivers list, they upgraded their car too but what ? The cars look the same. Who knows ? Who cares ? This makes upgrading the car so insignificant because of this because even when you upgrade the car, the AI are still the same which has...

- ... The same five cars that started first that get away on the first lap, has their best lap an entire second faster with you with supposedly a slower car (I'm playing on difficulty 6 but I'll be honest, from difficulty 4 to 8, there seem to be little to no difference. You could correct me on this me) and drives PERFECTLY for the entire race. Humans can make mistakes, they don't unless they interact between eachother. The only chance you have is a mix of both you're extremely good at the track and they have poor defined lines on a track. One such track is Lime Rock. And it is not fun at all.

- The AI is super slow when packed up, notably at the start of the race on the first turn, it's pretty much the only chance you have to get first place and try to get a lead and defend against the ridiculous AI.

- And speaking of being slow, you have to brake when they slow down really early or else you'll total your car. But when you brake too early because you misjudge the distance, they do not slow down and rams you off the track. It's so bad. When I tried a new genre of racing simulation games, the same issue happened and made me Alt+F4 and got the game refunded.""

First thing is I was a little wrong about difficulty 4 to 8 being the same. It's more like 6 to 8 but I have yet to experiment with difficulty 7 and 8 because of the following point that is ridiculous : When you go from difficulty 4 to 5 you go to +32% to +41% credits rewards and from 6 to 8 it's +44%, +47%, +50%. The gap in difficulty from 5 to 6 (a whole 2 seconds off AI Laps) and gaining 3% more credits is ridiculous. And even worse than that, you will actually earn more credits finishing first in difficulty 4 starting from 24th place than finishing first in difficulty 6 starting in 10th place. This should not be a thing at all and rewards should be pushed way up from difficulty 6 to 8. It's just there to make your solo experience miserable for nothing. I usually stay with 5 and start from last. That almost makes it as a generic GT race but I balance difficulty to make reaching first place actually a challenge and not a snooze fest.

Also, I've been realizing that the upgrade system starts to be an issue. They wanted to promote the fact of upgrading your car in between solo cups but you unlock the exact same upgrades in the exact same order and that makes it soo boring. Having to struggle with some boats having to grind to level 15 to unlock weight reduction should not be a thing and I'm really starting to dislike this aspect.

But yeah overall, I'm satisfied playing this game and glad to not see the hours passing by while playing it ! Can't wait for Nordschleife !",1697732217,1700511436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a car guy, I love cars and the only real reason I still login to play this game is the feeling of FOMO because I was a clown who bough the premium bundle and darn it I'm getting those cars. So I decided to pre-order the game after seeing the developer direct Turn 10 showed  us back in the summer with the feeling that maybe I can finally have a real next-gen racing game experience I could play with a controller (currently don't have space for a wheel setup.) But what I saw in the developer direct and what I see when playing the game is different game. The experience we were promised by the developers did not translate to the release version. 

Generally, for me the experience so far has been pretty stable, I did have two crashes so far. I can't complain about major game breaking performance issues; the reason I can't recommend this game is a whole list of little issues that ruin the car experience for me.  The feeling I get is that this game was not built by car guys and gals. Like there was no quality assurance for the cars going into the game. Here are a few things that made me go WTH or whaaaat?: the stock Lotus Evora wheels were not chrome, car tuning screen is so dark it's hard to see the wheel or body components you're selecting, on some cars the camera pans so you can't even see the wheels (BRM P201), there's no hp/torque graph for tuning, you can't change position of ballast, can't rev engine in tuning screen, the roll cages are terribly placed (I'm no race car builder but I don't think you're supposed to see above the roll cage, pre-race animation shaky cam,  my blue Ferrari FXXK was green in most lighting, flying starts throwing me off the track before practice, AI punting me off the track (improved AI?

There's still some behind-the-scenes steering assistance going on, if you're not at or below the speed and/or in the correct gear that the game thinks you should be, then your vehicle will not steer past a certain point.

The AI is absolutely atrocious, no matter what difficulty you put them at.  My recommendation is to put them on the easiest setting and get as far away from them as possible, or play in multiplayer lobbies with people that actually know how to drive.  The AI will ram you, pit maneuver you, brake check you, swerve into you, and in general just be absolutely trash.  They have their line, and they are going to stick to it, it doesn't matter if you are there first or even ahead of them.

I would still like to see MORE aftermarket instead of the same stuff that has been around since Forza Motorsport 4, and other engine swap choices, such as Coyote 5.0L, LS1, RB26, etc vs the same old trope (6.2L, NASCAR 5.9L, Rally 4-cyl).

Let's start with graphics. My pc isn't the most modern anymore but I get 60 fps on most games with mostly medium to high settings.
With this game I get unstable 50 fps with ugly graphics. All outer lines are very blurred end the lighting seems off. ACC with really high settings looks waay better. Much more detailed and I have a very solid framerate.

Secondly the UI isn't that intuitive in my opinion and loaded with bugs.
Steeringwheel settings keep reseting.
Content is lackluster and the dynamic time and weather rarely matters because there are no endurance races.

Conclusion: Wait!! Don't buy it for full price. This game could and up really good but it probably needs one more year to feel complete.

I enjoy the game, It gets my heart pumping when competing in the gt category. 
I like Rivals playlist, it's cool and challenging to leave a mark on the leader boards if your good enough or you've got the right car. 
Story mode/builders cup/showcase events are tedious but give you something to work for over a loooooong long long time put in. I'm excited for the lambo sesto elemento but wont be getting that till like next year until all the events are unlocked.

I cant wait for events/playlists to have skill and safety requirements. 
I wish there were championships.
Tournaments that you have to qualify over several days or hours.
I wish there were other things to see in the race results, after a race like metrics, tops speed of drivers, there are different types of penalties.... would be cool to see who got what type of penalty. 
would love and endurance playlist for gt you know?..... like 15,20 lap races depending on track length and mandatory pit stops, with safety and skill reqs.

All in all I've been waiting for this game to come put for years and i am disappointed in a lot of aspects but the game is still engaging and its still racing. 

Gran turismo was also dog $#%* when it first came out.
But with time it got A LOT BETTER.
I hope Microsoft wont let this be the end product.
I will say that buying the deluxe $100 version was not ideal. 
Lots of bugs, game crashing, horrible graphics stability and bad server stability. 
I paid extra for that?

Right now, with the current state of the game and compared to olders titles all the way back to Forza Motorsport 2 when I started, this game is nowhere close to the quality of previous titles. 

The Gameplay:
It's ""ok"" and still is Forza but there have been changes made that simply do not make any sense and frankly are just plain annoying after a short while. For example, you have to get ""Car XP"" for every single car you own. This means you have to unlock all the upgrades for every car over and over again. The annoying thing is that in the past you could just buy the upgrades depending on your driver level. Meaning that eventually you could just buy it all for all the vehicles. While I can understand you want a bit more progession to be involved, this aint it chief.

To make things worse, some core upgrades like tire compound are made so expensive that you often refrain from it for quite some time. This while tire compounds appear to have a major role in the game (which is actually nice). 

The races are plain and simple, straight forward. But the AI is not so 'dynamic' and 'evolving' as they said it would be. It's actually very easy AI even on the most difficult setting despite me being an average player at best. Now the AI has a few 'modes' while racing them. 1. RACING LINE OR BUST. They will ram you as much as they can to get you off the track. 2. You got the corner? I AM OFF TO NARNIA! Yeah the AI just divebombs into the gravel/grass or even the wall without being close to them simply because you had the racing line on the corner. 3. I'M JUST ENJOYING THE RIDE! Meaning, they just cruise around slowly.... They are not going for the best possible times they can get.

Now onto the driving itself..... and yeah.... CARS ARE NOT ON ICESKATES.
Some cars tend to just feel like you're driving on ice. This get's A LOT WORSE WHEN USING A WHEEL. I've made many laps in several vehicles on both controller and my G920 and I couldn't help but notice that when using a wheel there is simply no grip at all. Even if you mimic the input to your controller, the car just refuses to steer and starts gliding off the track like you're driving on ice. ""Git gud"" many said at the start but now most of us agree, wheel setups don't work right now.

FFB is BROKEN. When it works it's nice, but after a few laps it tends to just shutdown and randomly reappear again.

Graphics and Sound:
As many said, graphics are a mile off. While I've had some tracks that looked quite good and with some weather events involved even quite beautifull, this is a rare instance. I would say that Forza Motorsport 3 looks better in quite some ways than some tracks and, unfortunately, cars look. 

Sound overall decent but not that great. I did notice that on some car classes the brakes sound like a nitrous injection which is just weird.

Performance:
Shambles, it's not optimized at all and framerate can dip in low 40s for me in Ultra while the graphics themselves are nowhere near other games that run so much better. (I7 13700k, 32GB RAM @ 4200, RTX 3080 installed on M.2 NVME, RES: 3440x1440) RTX is not noticeable at all so rather just disable that. DLSS seems not to do anything and as mentioned, the game doesn't even look that good. If I were to boot up Project Cars, Assetto Corsa Competitione or heck even Forza Horizon 5 they just look so much better. Note: Forza Horizon 5 works like a dream and looks a lot better, I don't get how to got it so wrong here.

Multiplayer: Is a lot of fun. Best part so far especially thanks to the safety ratings. However, the penalty system needs work as players who tend to charge in like the Hulk get no pentalties but their victims do. Unfortunately this happened to me once so far.

Content:
Drip feeding content but also straight up lacking loads of content. Forza 7 has disappeared but we lack tracks and cars. So many inconic tracks that have always been in the titles are now missing or being released much later on (like Nordschleife).

I can't understand why this game lacks so much.


Overall: Like Gran Turismo 7 that has been out for 2 years now. This game needs work and after all that work it hopefully will be fine. But right now I just cannot recommend the game despite loving the Forza Motorsport series. This game made me step into Gran Turisme 7 as I never owned any of those titles before.",1700325408,1700325502,False,273,8,0.910211324691772461,0,True,False,False

   From where i should start....So i came and own FH3, FH4 and FH5 and i love them ( but i hate the lottery sistem on them) so this game is same game, same cars, same grfcs like FH4 and FH5 but with ""some"" realism on speed corners and a stupid level that you dont need it like that!!!!

    i just play assetto corsa,  why??  because i saw on youtube FM 2023 vs Assetto Corsa 2014, you can find it to see, so i decide to try for myself, and really i saw that the assetto corsa is much better than this crap.... the sound, felling of the car in cornering, on speed, on crash, grafics, sound on every car is nice and uniq, the AI, online PVP, way way way batter than FM !!!!!!!
   -  who has assetto corsa can make a test then play FM and you be stuned what assetto corsa can afford, what you fell the car when you drive it, you can see for yourself!

 -  if i wanna play some realism, i go to drive my car on track... if i want to feel a good sensation of speed from any car, F1 speed, F1 sound, some drift's, or DTM racing, single or in CO-OP whit my friends on a pit i play  assetto from now on, if i want some quick creazy race i play FH5. 

  - I had many years Assetto corsa in my steam librery, and it felt very hard to play, and mybe that's why i didn't played so much... And now i realize that the assetto corsa is the king off all, and if you think to add some mods in the game, will blow your mind,you can add for example the map from GTA 5 with AI.... think boys, think.... way to good, thank assetto for open my eyes and not to buy this FM ( a lie from dev that this game is created from the scratch up ) FM7 is feel more ok than FM ...

From the number of bugs, the very bad optimization which aren't even close to my biggest issues with this game. To the total neglect of PC players. A stupid (60-70ish) fps limit in online to make it ""fair"" for console players. The stupid ancient livery editor. And to the complete lack of support for triple screens which are industry standard for PC racing games (nevermind vr). It's just insulting imho to even sell this on PC in this current state and try to trick people into buying it. While they clearly just make a lazy port with no attention to the PC community whatsoever.

Also directly from the game description I quote: ""cross-play and cross-save with Xbox Series X|S players."" What they don't tell you. If you used to play on Xbox One and now try to sync your old stuff over to Steam bought FM. That isn't possible, you can only sync from MS to MS or from Steam to Steam. Maybe I misunderstand what ""cross-save"" is means. But imo this is false advertisement and borderline scamming.

This game is like Forza Horizon trying to mimic a serious racing game. It isn't really enjoyable as a casual racing game Forza has always been. But it isn't good as a more sim-ish game either. It has no character, no redeeming qualities. It's just a mess really.

Single player is pointless. You have limited options for events/tracks, and even when you finally get an event where you can race your 80's Ferrari or 60's McLaren, there's no point, because you'll never have another event anywhere you can use that car. Online? Lol. No. Online is only worse. Cars are pre-tuned, so even bad drivers with their assists have a halfway decent car. I have yet to see anything where I can race my Eclipse GSX, Ferrari F355, or Viper. 

But I raced online anyway. And that was a mistake. If you get a full lobby, don't expect to finish the race in the top ten unless you qualify in the top 3. Even then, you better get pole. And even then... People like to just remove you from the track. There's no point in trying to race when everyone is willing to just ram you off the track. Maybe, just maybe, there could be something worth playing in this game...

That ""something"" would be Open Track Day Meetups. Or any/all meetups. Drift lobby. Airport... These were the saving grace of Forza 7. Without these, this game is absolute trash. There's no point in playing it. 

I most certainly won't ever be paying Microsoft another penny for anything, ever. This was the last straw. I paid $100 for early access, and it was literally unplayable in that state. Now it's unplayable because it's already repetitive and griefers are rampant. What a waste. I guess it's finally time to buy a Playstation and go back to Gran Turismo. I miss their tracks anyway.

Single player AI is a nightmare. Multiplayer has become a series of events that play out over several hours. For players the that have no friends on forza (not surprising), there is nothing to do but get rammed or taken after the first lap Verstappen style. The Player base is about 1/5 of FH5 (1100 or so) so your options are limited. I paid $99 for the full package and have been left wanting ever since. Even with the updates, this game is trash. can't join a quick multiplayer race with the limited time I have to play. After 30+ hours, nothing to see here. Get AC/ACC/RF2 and you'll see what I mean.

I was a loyal forza fan since FM2 and new FM is a death note for the series. 

Graphics is broken:
- stutters no matter what settings are 
- fps drops in half after race or two or after changing random settings even not graphical
- black levels are mess, you can't see details in the dark parts of the image
- textures are soft and trailers don't represent it's quality
- grass textures are disgusting and out of focus, AC grass looks MILES better and it's a 9 yo game
- skies are literally from FM7 and there is a bug that makes them out of focus too
- before update 2 there was a problem with pixelated contours of cars and after update 2 fine details are gone
you can't see grills on cars!!!
- road reflections in the rain conditions are broken and go away while wipers are moving
- car's rims are replaced with 2d flat textures while moving on certain speed
- headlights are dull and you can't see far away at night races

MP doesn't work correctly:
- matchmaking doesn't work and lobbies full of rammers
- MP replays doesn't save so you can't see it or report a rammer
- constant disconnects at different points of the race (worst is to play 20 minutes of practice and end up disconnected on the start of the race)
- poor connection even when it's not

AI is broken:
- rams you all the time
- can't race you
- goes miles in front of you and if you pass them they drive much slower and can't overtake you properly
- can't be used in custom MP

Penalty system works strange:
- people often don't get panalties for ramming you on purpose if they push the breaks before the ram or for some other reason
- many times if you rammed by someone you can get penalty
- if someone spins in front of you and you hit them because you can't avoid it you can get penalty as a rammer
- sometime if you go off track slightly you can get 10 sec penalty

Devs should apologize and fix all the bugs that shouldn't be on release. They should get the game to the level of trailers in all aspects of the game. Then and only then they can modestly hope that players will trust them again.

I had no idea I always dreamed of such game to exist. The absolute best thing about it - it combines the option to tune and  mod your car with a crisp, superinformative and simulator-like force feedback. And you'll feel the impact of each tune you make drastically.

I don't get the complains about the grind - it actually makes you understand your car better with each mod you apply - from stock first and then with first available ""light"" mods  - just to understand which direction to go, what direction suits your driving style best. Not only that - each car I tried had its own distinct character. To the point that I can identify a car only by how it behaves. Some like iconic M3 or 93 911 completely smashed me and made me so emotional. 

It can actually be very relatable to real-life track experience - as a car owner you can understand what this or that mod might do to your car - and immediatelly feel it on track - and should clearly answer the question - should you go for the differential, beefier tires or coilovers first? Moreover, it can actually help you understand the character of the car before you go and buy one in the blind. I own 370z and this game completely captures its character and with it I undestand better what tunes should I buy for next track season. Of cource, it's not completely realistic and shouldn't be taken as is - but you get the general idea and direction.

From a game standpoint - it competely solves the lack of progression in true simulators like AC and helps understand each car much deeper and see all its pros and cons by experimenting with mods. 

If you have or plan to get/build a sports car and have a wheel setup - I cannot recommend this game enough.

When the game came out, it felt like the game is in beta and the studio used the community as beta testers to resolve bugs that would have easily been caught had the game been out for early release.

Replays in the game do not work at all and continue to not work even after the updates. You can choose to download the replay and then the game will freeze for 5 minutes, indicate the download is complete and then the replay is no where to be found.

The sharing system is very lackluster, you can't really find anyones tunes, decal or replays very easily and the interface looks like it's designed by someone who is just checking boxes off a requirements list rather than someone who actually cares about the user experience.

The multiplayer races feel repetitive after a day of playing because there are fixed cars and maps per week. The only fresh experience is surviving aggressive players who like to crash into you at any point of the race. In private lobbys, you're not able to add AI to fill in the gap, which makes racing feel less exciting. Most of the content in terms of maps and cars can be discovered after a month of playing. 

Some missing/nice to have features would be:
- customizable multiplayers such as random car specs + maps, rather than having fixed windows for specific cars + map. 
- reversing the direction of each map would also be great to have to add more challenges to the racing aspect. 
- In practice & qualifying, having live updates with the position of the other cars with their current time would be really great to have
- turning on a ghost position of yourself in your previous lap so you can have a visual cue of how to keep up/out pace yourself
- Having the garage available in private lobbys to be able to modify and adjust cars without having to enter the game screen
- Having some recommended tunes for different tracks to help those who aren't familiar with how to tune and adjust their cars
- A working Replay system (why add this to the game if y'all aren't even going to make sure it works?)
- In practice, make it so that slower cars can't interfere with faster cars. There is a lot of room for trolls and aggressive drivers to mess up practice laps

The fact their is no drag, or drift online like the past forza's  and from what I've heard its online pretty much abandoned already.(didn't play it because to many issues offline to even try so can't confirm or deny it).  The smallest amount of tracks i think I've ever seen in a forza game. Was hoping to see Fuji mountain return, Daytona 500 track again, The Prague track from forza 5. Even the cars seem to be lacking Compared to forza horizon 4 hoping with all the payed dlc's it'll make up for that but we'll see.     Issues!!!!  going from 20-40 FPS in races in a constant bounce, Infinite loading screens (that's a new one after this patch for me), the tracks not even loading in all the way for me which i thought hey maybe it was on my end because I got a older build... then again forza horizon 4 ran fine on it for the record. So I'm gonna say Nope after the patch it just got worse.

It's particularly exciting to drive these on the same circuits I've been familiar with in grip racing games for years.

The online matchmaking system in Forza Motorsport 8, while reminiscent of iRacing, seems less robust. The game offers weekly rotations of multiple events, keeping the gameplay fresh and encouraging players to experiment with different cars. It features multiple spec racing series and open racing series each week, similar to iRacing. The game is designed to level up your car to unlock its full tuning potential. Throughout the week, players can focus on tuning their chosen car to achieve first place in the numerous online races. The gameplay loop involves choosing a car, unlocking parts, upgrading and tuning it to ideally advance through the pack to first place, providing a satisfying experience when achieving this goal. With the end of each week, a new race series is released, and the process starts anew.

This system is very similar to the gameplay loop in iRacing, and currently, it seems like one of the best approaches to online circuit racing.

The game offers a wide range of track choices, most of which will be familiar to racing game enthusiasts.

However, as we are in the first month since its launch, the game is still quite buggy. The most significant issue at the moment is that the game frequently crashes. There are times when, after a 20-minute practice session and tuning your car, the game crashes just as the race is about to start.

I tried many racing games including Forza Horizon,  Asetto Corza, Grid Legends, WRC (new one), Dirt Rally etc.  The handling and the feel of the cars is much more meaty than in Grid, Horizon or WRC. This game is a Sim-lite experience when it comes to driving, not as hardcore as something like Corza or Gran Turismo but you can feel the weight behind every car, you can feel it being different after every upgrade you put in the car and the driving just feel right. It is certainly much more hardcore than Grid, Horizon or Dirt Rally for example.

Combine this with incredible visuals (if your rig can handle it - I can't speak for anyone else, on a high end system on max with raytracing it just works and runs fine hits the VRR window for 120fps most of the time with DLAA engaged as well) and good sound design and you have a very fine racing game on your hands. 

The progression is a bit weird to be honest but you just get used to it. It takes a while to level and upgrade a car and you are constantly switching cars between races/championships most of the time so you never get bored. It is easy to tweak any driving options to your liking as well and the game is well suited to be used with a controller which is not always the case with  racing sims. 

The multiplayer is probably best in class, you can just join practice sessions from the menu and it tells you clearly how long you have until race start and you have time to practice the course and do a time qualify in that time to determine your starting grid placement. It's a fine system, not difficult to engage with the menu options, everything just works. There is also a penalty system if you somebody uses shortcuts or starts ramming people which works fairly well in my experience.

To be honest I am not sure what the negative reviews are all about, me personally haven't had any issues, the game maybe crashed 2 or 3 times in my 27 hour playtime so far which is still annoying but  did not ruin my experience with it.

This game has a lot of issues which may be not a big deal to most players but for me personally i got some problems with it. let me start off by the good things. The graphics look great, a lot more realistic then FM7, thats if you have a beefy PC. The vehicle handling has much improved as well, the turning,braking etc feels very good, the car leveling system is good too, i do like that approach.

The bad:

Races: The race length is a joke. in FM7 you can change the length of races to be short, average, long and very long. Why is that not a thing in this game? Theirs pit stops, fuel consumption, tire wear etc but since the races are so short there's no point in even worrying about such a thing. so why even bother putting in the game.

Damage: The damage in this game is bloody laughable. In FM7 if you even rear end someone you gain damage to your car where in the least your headlights no longer work, in this game you can smash into the wall at 150mph and not so much as a scratch, wtf is that. 

fps drops: I run a semi beefy pc with a rtx 3080 on a ultra wide 1440p 100hz, with a Intel 10 series cpu and 32gb ram, at medium setting I've been hitting between 20-50fps, I had to download and install a mod from nexus to fix this issue which now i get a a average of 90-100fps on ultra settings. Its funny it take one person to make a mod to fix a huge game play issue, but months for a multi-billion dollar game studio to fix a serious issue. 

Practice: This is mixed, I don't really care about practice sessions, just let me race the races instead of having to do pointless practice sessions, I know a lot of players like them and that's fine, but at least make a option to never do them to save time having to skip them in race. and another thing, right before the actual race it show every driver on the grid, idgaf, get rid of that or make a option to not show that, another pointless feature imo. 

All in all this game has a lot more work to be done imo. bring back everything that was good in FM7 and just copy and paste the code over to FM8, especially the race lengths, and fix the damn damage.",1699803782,1699803782,False,3,0,0.500579595565795898,0,True,False,False

- always recompiling shaders on startup

It's already like $30 more than most other AAA games for the base game.

The good; 
-Cutscenes look good
-Cars look good (mostly)
-Lots of accessibility options
-Some good cars
-Modifying (sort of)
-Gives a decent amount of credits for a building cup, so you can at least buy a similar or better car afterwards, and have change. Not too much, not too little.

The bad;
-Game stutters a lot
-Default graphics it set for me were ps2 levels to run at 30fps. 
-Attempting to use AMD fsr, causes the game to just crash.
-Physics are awful. Like, I've never had that much trouble trying to drive a fwd in any forza game before this. ABS on, and the car just plows forwards under braking and under accel. In a car that doesn't act like that, at that. AWD car was also awful. It at least didn't sledge like it had no front grip, but instead just had no brakes or turning at all. 0 turn in. Though part of this could have been the handling I had selected. But normally normal doesn't mean it'll just not let you turn in or turn.
-Even on medium, the cars in the distance are ps1/ps2 era of sprites.
-Modifying is locked behind progression, which isn't inherently bad, but at least let me get the tuneable things early on, so I can dial in the suspension, or even let me have some body parts early on. first car, body kits were locked behind level 7 and 9. At least wheels were early on.
-Unskippable cutscenes and tutorials. This was by far the most egregious. I went to change settings mid way through the tutorial first race, and it crashed. So, naturally it gives me all the unskippable cutscenes again, and I have to go from go again. Still ps2 era graphics, because I can't change them until I have a save point, or risk all these long ass cutscenes and babbling again. Then when it's time to modify the car for the first time, it gives you like 3 minutes solid of telling you how to do it, without being able to skip. Then forces you to auto modify. doesn't even let you decide the first time around.
-Forced 3 practice laps before every race. Like, I get practice is worth doing, but at least make it optional like Project cars did. I don't care if it gives you progression, having to do 10 minutes of practice before 10 minutes of race, is awful. 
-AI is straight up awful. First 3 cars are great to battle, but the pack behind is mindless and borderline suicidal
-Penalties straight up are broken. I got run into by ai a handful of times, from them just running up my ass, or mindlessly turning into me, and I got penalties for 'avoidable accidents'. I also got no penalties for avoidable accidents of me hitting them.
-Seems to be straight up rubberbanding, where cars behind you have a pretty high chance of catching up, but once in front of you, don't disappear, despite having a faster setup. Then you catch up to them, and it's back and forth

It's honestly disappointing, because I've been looking forward to this for a long time, and it just didn't live up to the hype, or the previous games. It feels like they're getting worse every iteration.
God I hope the game gets fixed, and is good in a few months. Might buy it back, and enjoy it. But until then, I'm hoping for a refund, so I can spend the money on something else",1699788800,1699788800,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

ORIGINAL: Let me be clear, this game needs a lot of work right now, mainly in the quality of life department. Graphical bugs, replays not working, random crashing, and so on.. it has not been the greatest launch at all. However, I am so excited for the future of this game. The multiplayer mode is going to be the star of the show, it's been phenomenal so far. I've seen nothing but clean and competitive racing, and the newer penalty system is doing its job well. There have been a handful of races so far where it has come down to inches. The driving physics as well as the fuel and tire mechanics are the best they've ever been in the series. My only gripe with this game so far is the car leveling system, I strongly believe it should be a manufacturer based system and not per car. Perhaps this will be adjusted in the near future. I'm sure a lot of the other issues that we are facing will be ironed out soon enough.",1696916084,1699767057,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons: Graphics need help, subpar if you ask me. Crashing on free-play games after first restart. Starting line bug that puts you in first as soon as you cross the finish, repeats after restart. Slide mechanic is bugged and at times you feel as if you are attempting to be a Zamboni on ice. German cars seems to drive like boats. There is a lot to fix and I would suggest waiting until these game breaking bugs are fixed. Currently its a no for purchase until they pull their head out and polish this game. Did I mention black rims turn to chrome, paint shop also needs fixing as  well. Leveling system needs to be less harsh, just have everything unlocked, why a rank system for each upgrade.

I like the new handling model, I like the weather, I like the sound design (can be a tad loud). I personally do not mind the shorter career and the car upgrade system - more on this later - since I like driving cars in their stock forms to get a feel for how they behave and to get a bearing on what I'd like to upgrade on it. I also like the combination of older FM cars combined with newer cars we see released in FH (talking here about cars that didn't make it into the end of FM7 to present day FH5).

Unfortunately, this is about all I can say for what I perceive to be objective good points for this game. 

The negatives, as you may be able to see from all the other reviews, range from performance issues, graphical fidelity (lack thereof), stability issues, the new car upgrade system, the short career mode, and general conceptions of laziness or negligence on the developers' part (old car models, prematurely releasing an unfinished game, etc.). I'd like to focus on the reasons why I personally recommend against buying this game in its current iteration (dated November of 2023). 

Stability and performance issues seem to run pretty rampant throughout the game, although I've not had many experiences of this sort. I suppose I've been pretty lucky not to have had such experiences but the devs will not receive my approval based solely on this. No doubt some here will refer to the currently ongoing problem of crashes (including one that apparently originated from having an audio output device plugged into your PC's front audio jack - I have no clue how this can happen), low framerates, and from what I've seen on the forums and the Forza & FM subreddits: the game environment/world disappearing or failing to load altogether. On the bright side, no way to exceed track limits if the track doesn't load right?

It seems that the dev team have since managed to patch out some of the stability issues with the last few updates but some are still ever so present, and they seem to be having a harder time trying to fix the disappearing environment. I've heard someone say on the forums that it could be due to the difficulty in finding a definitive cause, I can't pass judgement on that since I don't believe I'm qualified to. On another note, the graphics are, unfortunately, crap. It seems to me that the devs focused much more on reflections than on texture clarity, since most of the cars I look at tend to appear more as blurry imitations of the car made out of clay. I can make do without the sharpest graphics, but this is unacceptable for a Triple-A game released in late 2023.

Another point of contention here concerns the new car upgrade system. While I don't hold any animosity towards it, I will acknowledge that in terms of pure accessibility, it is a massive step back from the previous standard. In previous titles, I would always drive a car in its stock form first before upgrading it regardless to get a general feel for it - I don't believe that this should be forced on everyone. At the time of writing, the devs have lowered car level requirements for upgrades but I still believe that it's better off getting rid of the system altogether. God knows that I'll still drive the cars stock before upgrades anyway.

I have the same attitude to the shorter campaign - I don't mind it, but it couldn't hurt to be longer. One major gripe I do have in regards to the campaign is the AI. I understand the AI has been improved, but it does not feel like it. I've been rammed off the track by the AI more times than I can count at this rate, and the AI in lower tiers tend to, how do I put this, have an affinity to aim not for the apex of a corner but the outside wall 50 meters away. With 44 hours on record as of writing this I've had only one good on track battle with an AI, that's it (I now spend most of my time in rivals).

The short version: The game, in its current form, is unacceptable by standards set for a Triple-A game in 2023. It is not worth it even on a 75% off sale at this moment. It is too unstable, too unoptimized, and too graphically inadequate. Current updates have addressed some stability issues but still more remain, and it's unknown when larger issues such as the disappearing environment will be fixed (it's already been more a month including early access). While the new handling physics, dynamic weather, and sound design in theory enhance the gameplay experience, this is only true if your game actually works properly. Like I said, it seems I'm lucky enough to have my game work properly, but just like the car upgrade system and and shorter campaign (disregarding the AI, obviously), I will not give the devs a free pass just because I do not take issue with it. Hopefully this game gets better as time passes and updates are pushed, but I'd be hard pressed to justify shelling out more than 20 dollars for it in its current form.",1699735870,1699736191,False,5,0,0.528795838356018066,0,True,False,False

I'm a long time Forza fan, starting with 2 on a friends Xbox and going full time with 3 once I got a 360. 
This game is broken and unfinished. There are tracks missing, along with many cars. 
It will randomly crash, could be sitting in a multiplayer lobby waiting for a friend to join, could be loading into a new track. No rhyme or reason. 
I have a 10th gen i9 CPU and an RTX 3080. This is not a hardware issue. Horizon 5 runs without problems (after several patches, because when I bought that game it wouldn't run on PC for a month). 
I'm honestly pissed that I spent $100 USD on the game. Tracks like Prague, the Nordshliefe, Road Atlanta etc should all be in the base game. This is just stupid. 
I did not mind the car levels at first, until I wanted to make a drift car and spent 3 hours trying to max the damn thing out to get horsepower and a few other things unlocked (this is after the update that sort of fixed the unlocks but you still get nowhere near enough car points to actually build what you want). 
This is a big problem, because Forza 7 was a great game for 'sandbox' stuff. Just using built up credits to make whatever you want at anytime. What a big letdown. 
Yes, the actual gameplay is fantastic. AWD cars are actually usable, and you can feel right where the grip is on any track, any car, any tires. 
How did it get this bad? Is Microsoft and the Forza franchise really that strapped for cash that they figure releasing an unfinished game while selling the rest of it to folks as DLC is acceptable? FUCK RIGHT OFF. 
I really wanted to like this. I was not worried when the game was delayed by a year, as more development time should be a good thing. It is fucking broken, and feels like nobody actually play tested it. 
I'm also pissed they removed Forza 7 from the store as I would pay full price to run that on PC as my OG Xbox One is too slow for my disc version of 7 to be playable anymore. 
I just wanted a great Forza game, and this simply isn't it. I know this turned into a giant ramble/bitch fest but I guess this is modern gaming. Fuck the consumer, make that cash or whatever.

While the racing physics are great and supposedly multiplayer is pretty good (I don't race online), the game is held back by a plethora of problems. The biggest issues are PC performance issues. I have a 4090 and struggle to get consistently smooth frame rates regardless of settings. I get stutter that can last up to 10 seconds on one lap, and the next lap no stutter, then the next lap stutter again. Certain graphics settings appear to be broken - sometimes this game looks great and other times it looks absolutely terrible.

Progression is mediocre. The best way to level your car is to turn on automated assists and let the car drive itself for an hour to put the basic upgrades you want on it. I like to try cars and tinker with them until they're set up the way I want - this game forces you to drive each car a few hours to fully unlock everything. It's honestly pretty trash. 

If you must have the latest Forza, go for it. Otherwise, wait for this one to mature some. Because at launch it's not great. But it does have a ton of potential to be that Forza game we've all wanted. But right now this isn't it.

Physics: Some of the physics just don't make particular sense. The Honda CIvic Type-R has a tendency to oversteer which is not true-to-life for this FWD car. The Subaru BRZ (RWD) has a tendency to understeer, which just doesn't make sense for a RWD car that is very tail-happy in real life.

Progression: Forza Motorsport cribs from Call of Duty's playbook in requiring you to ""level up"" each car in order to unlock mods for it. It doesn't matter how much money you have saved up in the bank, as it uses a completely different currency. I get forcing the player to learn the ropes in the first couple of hours of gameplay, but the system forces you to have several hours of not having fun to finally have fun [i]for each car[/i].

Turn 10 still has not fixed some of the most basic functions of the game. In Career Mode and Practice Mode, if you try to upgrade the performance of a car it is a flip of a coin on if the game will crash or not. The game still routinely goes into a perpetual loading screen (loading circle) when it tries to apply an upgrade. It happens far more frequently in Career Mode, but still happens often in Practice.

In addition to the aforementioned issue, the game does not properly save Career Mode progress and if the previous bug hits, it often leads to losing any progress previously made in Career Mode. To avoid losing progress, the best workaround right now is to exit to the main screen after each race stage. This helps to ensure the auto-save properly saves your progress.

I still would hold off for new buyers of the game until after the upcoming November 14th update in order to see if they have addressed the issues.

UPDATE 10/31/2023:
Game is mostly unplayable at the moment. I cannot enter into a practice mode and tune a car without it crashing within several minutes of driving and tuning.
________

ORIGINAL:
I'll begin with the Cons first, because they largely overshadow the Pros. If you're looking for a racing game, it'll do the job, but if you're wanting to play this game in a competitive way, whether online or solo, it's pointless at this time. The AI is so bad that close racing is not an option. The AI does not act like a sensible racer, but instead a bowling ball. Also, online play can be worth it but you're always gonna get those people that just want to wreck people out. If the online games were more numerous, I could live with that from time to time, but when I have to wait 30 minutes to get back into a race, it really saps the enjoyment out of online play.

This game can be more enjoyable, but Turn 10 has to quickly fix a lot of the issues. They appear to have released an unfinished game because the AI situation would have been figured out within one play session by a developer, and it should have been worked on and fine tuned. At this time, I would not recommend the game, but I'll still continue to play it because it's enjoyable if you can work around the CONS stated below.

CONS:
1. Game stability is very poor. The game crashes randomly quite often, and I can also force a crash consistently when trying to make an advanced game mode

2. The AI is horrendous. The AI does not drive like it's a race game on any of the 1 thru 8 levels. They actively seek out crashes on straights and corners. Example, if I'm ahead in a corner, the AI will blow thru the corner and T-Bone my car on a regular basis. Also, in corners for no reason the AI will often brake test which leads to crashes.

3. The penalty system needs a rework. There is no consistency as to how/when penalties will be applied. A computer can initiate a crash into my car and I will receive a penalty for it, or  I can cut whole corners out of a race and no penalty will be applied. The time system of applying a penalty is nice, but when there's no sense to it, it's pointless.

4. Online play can be quickly ruined by someone who wants to just wreck out everyone. With long wait times between races, this can quickly sap the fun out of a play session when one race is ruined and then I have to wait 30 minutes to hopefully get into a decent race.

5. The base tuning for the vehicles are awful and the developers could do a much better job of presenting more realistic driving characteristics without having to do a deep dive in the tuning menu. The tuning menu should be for those that want the best performance out of a car, but as it stands, people have to tune a car just to get a realistic stock performance


PROS:
1. Large variety of vehicles to choose from

2. The variety of game modes are nice if solo play is preferred

3. Leveling up cars can be time consuming, but it's nice that the Car XP is recoverable and I don't have to spend game money on wasted upgrades",1698351888,1699553753,False,3,0,0.502328276634216309,0,True,False,False

Halo matchmaking in Forza.

Pick your car, and the game finds a match with like-minded individuals with similar cars and similar specs. So if you have a F1 car, bam you're racing with a bunch of F1's, Miata? bam you get SENT TO THE DUMPSTER FUCK YOU. and if that's not all possible i'd like to at least be able to pick whatever kind of class type at any time, no more of this ""wait 6 days for the next class, asshole"" just let me do what i want, and hey if you still want to make one class shine over the others for a little bit, make a double XP weekend or some shit for a specific class.

The worst game ever with the worst developers. Everyone says dont blame the developers, blame the publisher. This game is proof that it is the developers fault as the game has been out almost a month and you still cant play it. Thanks Steam for not refunding me. This game shouldnt even be on your platform.
Edit edit: This game goes from bad to worse. Now I cant even get past the input screen in settings to set up my controller as it says I need to bind a key to pause it but wont let me bind a key. This is a known fault by them but they havent fixed this game breaking bug. I wonder if steam will give me my money back. If so, Ill come back in a few months because at the moment this game is unplayable.

I spent 90 pound on this crap, the most I have ever spent on a game in the last 40 years and it is probably the most unplayable game I have tried to play. The developers should be ashamed of themselves.

I have 34 hours in this game. Most of that has been spent shouting and swearing at my pc because of the bugs.

I have requested a refund. Save your money, buy it when it is fixed.

Edit: After playing the game for another 17 hours and even after the first patch it is still doing the same thing. It doesnt save my progress and now the turn navigation voiceover is only working in the practice and not in the race. This game is going for bad to worse.

I love this game. I have played now for 13 hours. However, it has a bug that makes it unplayable at the moment. I keep doing different races in the cup and it says it has saved but then when I go back into the cup or try to progress I have to do that race again. I have been stuck on Hokkone even though I have completed it three times. So the cups are unplayable at the moment. I'm one of the few people online that has been saying good things about this game as I am genuinely enjoying it. However, I cant play the single player cups at the moment.

So, I originally reviewed this game a few weeks ago with the frustration of not being able to start the game. However, after following some work arounds, I have been able to actually put some miles into this game and I can say honestly; This game is fun, but, it really needs more time and development before I change that little red thumbs down to a blue thumbs up. I can see this game providing real competition to the sim titles I have to take up my pixel racing time, but, Turn 10 needs to put a little more love and time into polishing the game up, so, we all need to have a bit of patience

What I enjoy is the variety of cars that you can jump around and race in, and each car behaves differently, as you would hope. I have mostly spent my time in the Open servers and I believe Turn 10 needs to do more with Open events. For me, if I want to race GT cars, I pop on Assetto Corsa Competizione, if I want to race pure bred Touring Cars, I have Assetto Corsa, Rfactor 2 and Automobilista 2 for that, but, if I want to race an EK Civic hatchback or a HSV Gen-F GTS or a Nissan R34 GTR that have been modified to be a race car, with the parts I have specifically chosen? Well, THAT is why I picked up Forza 8 ('NeEd FoR sPeEd DoEs ThAt Bet-' no, shut up, street racing isn't cool). I would rather see way more Open events to use the cars I would most likely be racing in real life, than cars that I have 2 or 3 different sims for that do a much better job at simulating and I also have zero chance of racing in my lifetime.

The car progression system, I'm kind of on the fence with. I kind of like that you are limited to what you can put on the car with Car Points, so, it does feel like you are developing a car rather than going all out with an immediately over powered vehicle, but, it does kind of suck that you can't just have every part available immediately. It's very Call of Duty, but, with cars.

I play with the Fanatec CSL DD 8nm and FFB feels ok. Not up there with ACC, but, not the worst FFB I have felt. More work needs to be done with Force Feedback as I can't really feel when the tyres have rolled over kerbs or the edge of the circuit, etc, etc, but, I guess that could give a real disadvantage to anyone playing with a gamepad or keyboard, whatever, so, again, a balance needs to be struck up and that takes time

Penalty system and match making needs to be shown a bit more love, too. I seem to keep getting matched with rammers and I think some penalties don't fit the crime (copping a penalty for running a smidge wide and gaining no time for instance), but, that's AI for you. Apparently, that AI can learn and get better, but, we'll see how that develops. We could also use some multiplayer servers in Asia Pacific. The ping is a real killer when racing with those in Europe and America.

The really, really bad things are the bugs really kill the enjoyment. It isn't Bethesda level of bugs, but, they are bad. I still can't save my controller bindings, meaning that I have to rebind every single one of my controller bindings when I start the game, and boy do I have to restart the game a bit because of the crashes or glitches. Glitches that should have been patched out after the day one patch, but, here we are nearly a month on and the same issues plague the game (Patch 2 is just around the corner at time of writing this)

Overall, when this game works, it is a lot of fun to play and I can look over some of the ramming that goes on. That's no different to racing LFM on ACC or any open lobbies in the majority of sim titles. What this game really needs is more time and love from the dev to iron out the bugs, the glitches and fine tune the games mechanics. While I do enjoy it and it is a competitor to ACC, AMS2, Rfactor2 and AC already, in it's current state, I can't in good faith rush out and highly recommend that you drop full price on this game. Again, it just needs way more time in the oven, but, I do wish that AAA devs would stop releasing half finished products and charging us top dollar for it.",1697942850,1699435229,False,3,0,0.50027763843536377,0,True,False,False

I learned of Forza and turn 10 many many years ago during a sleep over at my aunt's, having played the 4th installment of Motorsport. Wonderful game. I've played all but the first two Horizon titles, and so far the games have been a pleasure to experience, well, except Motorsport 7...and this new one. Only 20 minutes of play time, I noticed a disappointing theme. The terrible fucking handling and sense of speed. The opening races with the corvette and the caddilac lmp car are as far as I got.

In the cut scene the corvette had no problem tearing up corners. But the moment you take control, it forgets how to turn. Look at the speedometer, it looks as if you're taking a turn at 90mph. This is where it goes south. You're actually going about half that and the car is absolutely struggling to turn. That is NOT how you open a game and get a good impression. Especially for someone like me. I'm a function over aesthetics kind of guy. this game doesnt function up to par to expectations.

Moving on to the second opening race in the lmp car, the Cadillac handled exactly the same as the corvette. Taking turns at a similar speed, struggling just as much. I had hoped the corvette had been tuned by an absolute moron, which it probably was, and that the lmp car would fare better. To see an lmp car handle worse than a goddamn F-150 ruined it for me. This game is a major disappointment, and it only took 20 minutes to see that, when I came into the game with high hopes.

I wasn't pre-conditioned in any way to think it would be this bad. But it is. Spend your $70+ elsewhere, this game is a waste of effort and time.",1699427126,1699427126,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The game handles beautifully.
-Graphics are good- even on low end hardware.
-Singleplayer is rewarding and fun.

The Bad:
-The game can feel overly grindy for any car that is not part of the single player series as free play feels different than the cups as its a singular race and not a ""season."" While it is annoying- this problem is heavily overstated by people with 2 hrs of play time. This is due to people parroting reviewers.

The UGLY:
-The Penalty System and the way it interacts with multiplayer- In my qualifier races- my first race was pit maneuvered and went from 3rd to like 14th, my second race was clean, and my third race I was hit with a 4 second penalty after someone lost grip, went off track and unsafely entered in-front of me while I was going 120 mph. I thought that was a blip

Even with an A safety rating- Pit maneuvers are common. People will often pit you, and FACE ZERO PENALTIES WHILE YOU GET PENALIZED.

The penalty system needs to be completely reworked as in its current state- The multiplayer is unplayable as long as you aren't a pro who purposely tanked their driver skill to dopamine farm 1st places.",1699411719,1699411719,False,3,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False

UPDATE~

Game is still absolute trash as an experience as a whole, campaign doesn't save randomly for most people, multiplayer has you stuck in a black screen for 10-15 mins and people mostly quit out by then, safety ratings mean nothing where S is stuck with the lowest so it's pretty meaningless, and many, many, many, many just other crazy bugs people are having.

They've decided to save some necessary fixes that haven't even been implemented since release despite how broken of a game this is it's crazy they get away with releasing games like this these days.

The caRPG system feels very loosely thought out. So many of the race cars have so few parts that it makes levelling practically pointless since increasing air flow is already permitted at base level.

The devs need to seriously consider allowing you much, MUCH greater flexibility in the number of parts you can customize across ALL cars. Give us a much, MUCH wider range of possible air flows and restrictor plate options. So many of the race cars that were formerly blazing fast in previous forza games are now hard nerfed even with the largest air flow option equipped. 50 levels that you basically do and earn nothing with unless you are trying to get the manufacturer discounts. It is awful.

The limited customization options + the currently limited car set makes the caRPG feel like a begrudging slog to have to cope with more than anything, and I say that as someone who has maxed out multiple cars already since I basically just play 2 hours of Le Mans / Spa most of the time.

The driving feels just as good as the previous Forza titles, if not better with the new dynamic track elements, and overall the dynamic car wear system is a good, even if mostly superfluous touch. I don't think most people notice how insanely dirty their cars become unless they are like me and do endurance races at Le Mans.

The new AI is a mixed bag... Sometimes it is great and other times is absolutely brain dead, but at least it is not consistently brain dead like it used to be in FM7 where they would always cause a major pileup at Turn 1 at the start of a race.

The rampant amount of visual bugs that many are experiencing though is a huge cause for concern and unless your hardware is extremely beefy, expect to see at least some though it is a complete roll of the dice.

And the career system is still a MASSIVE JOKE. It is just a series of loosely connected events that you are forced to play in a semi specific order. There is just next to no personality or freedom of approach.

I also just can't stomach recommending the game at its current $70 USD price point.

It is a good step forward overall, but the mixed levels of content/customization, the bugs, the lackluster ""career"" mode really don't make it feel worthwhile at full price. Consider picking it up at discount for $35-40 USD instead.

I will at least change the review to a recommend when they fix the major bugs.

Edit: Nope, keeping it a negative review. They are drip feeding content and so much of the game is a fucking snooze.

Turn 10. Your presentation skills are dog shit. You have next to no stylization or personality in the game, even less than in the recent Forza Horizon games. Every time I see my driver win, I feel like I am watching recycled footage from the F1 games. And that sentiment extends to most of this game's aesthetic.

Find some personality and aesthetic to glamour the game up.

Create an actual separate career save mode that can be restarted and replayed for fun to add some actual variety and experiences to strive for. Y'know, an actual finite, repeatable PLAYTHROUGH. I have more fun deleting my saves on a PS2 emulator to replay GT3 and 4 from scratch trying out different vehicles to tackle the events.

And to go back to what I said regarding the caRPG system, fuck it. It is awful. Instead of locking parts behind the system, it should have just been a cosmetic vanity system that other players could see to get an idea behind how much you have driven a particular vehicle Maybe something that hides certain bodykits and heavy modifiers behind it or access to legendary vehicles, but definitely not fucking basic ass car parts. It is shit, I hate it.

By the way, the majority of my hours are just from AFKing the game to max out most of the cars. And I don't regret it. When it is more viable to just let the game play itself for you instead of playing the game, then you have a genuine problem. This is ridiculous.

A frustrating, looping, endless stall.

For every launch leads to a freeze.
Gamers geared up for a fiery race,
Only to be caught in a frozen embrace.

Expecting lightning, met with a crash.

I would not recommend this game in it's current state. If you are like me and have played many other sim racing titles, such as iRacing, AC/ACC and love sim racing. This is not going to improve the sim racing or simcade genre in its current state. This is a badly unfinished product that does not give the gaming and sim racing communities confidence in AAA game releases. Even Project cars 2 and GT7 are miles better then this game. IMO even as a arcade game Forza Horizon series is better. T10 should be ashamed of what they released. 6 years in the making, more like 6 months.
 
Having said all that, there are some good things about this game and if T10 listen to the community and the end user they then may be able to turn this game into something as good or even better then GT7. But they have not got off to a good start on doing that either. They really need to start rolling out some updates or a planned schedule of how they will fix the issues with this game.

THE GOOD.
1. It does have a FOV slider.
2. Replays are slightly better.
3. FFB is pretty good once you get it dialled in. I would say as good as GT7.
4. Overall handling and the physics are much improved. Some cars feel fantastic.
5. Tracks look good sometimes.
6. Multiplayer is Pretty good and fun but needs some work.
And that is it for the good. Sad I know.

THE BAD.
1. Physics while pretty good in most street cars and much improved, the race cars are not so good. They do not even resemble a race car what so ever. They feel like something from the Flintstones. I could give many examples but i am not going to wast my breath, as i think many others have already outlined what is wrong with them.
2. FFB is awful out of the box. You need to take a good couple of hours to get is dialled in which could turn some people off that have a wheel. It should at least be half decent out of the box. Thankfully there are some YouTube videos out now that explain all the setting. I recommend YouTube Channel ERMZ.
3. Another one is when you change the profile of your tires there is no visual representation that you did, they look the same. Plus if you put new wheels on your car you can not change the offset.
4. Up Grading cars as most know is locked behind levelling your car up. It takes way to long. They should IMO just go back to what it was in previous titles.
5. AI is as bad as FM7
6. Tracks. No Nordschleife, plus there is just not enough tracks for a game that has supposedly been in development for years.
7. Poor optimisation, even my 4090 struggles with this game. And the graphics are nothing special. 
8. DLSS does not work. Maybe some driver updates will fix it but do not hold your breath.
9. I have had multiple PC crashes.
10. The game does not save progress sometimes.
11. Always online game. Wish they would stop doing this.
12. Can not crate my own open lobby in multiplayer.
There is a lot more little things that are bad about this game but i do not have the time to list them all.

THE UGLY.
The graphics are horrible for a next gen game. Everything is washed out, textures are muddy and blurry looking. Some of the track textures do not even load or render properly. The cars look very cartoonish, especially after they get a scratch or some dust on them. On track they look nothing like they do when you view them in the garage, especially the AI cars on track, they look like they are from XBOX 360. Even in the garage some cars are not the best. Forza Horizon 5 and GT7 look way better IMO. Even Assetto Corsa with mods is better and it is a 10 year old game.

FINAL THOUGHTS.
I had high hopes for Forza Motorsports reboot. I thought it would be some what like GT7 a good simcade racer. I was hoping I would be able to relax and play and watch some beautiful cars in replay mode, then play some multiplayer with some of my friends, that do not have a PC to play the real sims. How ever i was thoroughly disappointed. I cannot believe they released this in its current state, it is totally unacceptable. In its current state I give the game a 4/10 and cannot recommend it to anyone. Lets hope they fix it soon. I would not put money on them doing that as they have not got off to a good start.

Hell, I barely read reviews. But here we are. I've played every Forza game ever made. Even Forza Street. Forza got me to step away from Gran Turismo and switch sides. I've spent that much time with this franchise over the years. When  I heard after 6 years that a new Motorsport was coming out, i was ecstatic. My nostalgia for FM7 is strong. It had it's issues, but I would hardly call it a bad game. Built from the ground up, this one is. Brand new. Not even number 8. Just Motorsport. A brand new beginning. A terrible, horrible beginning. Imagine my lack of surprise when I decided that the first time I decided to leave a review for a game, it's MOSTLY NEGATIVE. Let me tell you why:

Pros:
Same stuff you find in every other racing game. Seriously. This game does nothing to set itself apart from GT7 or Asseto Corsa. Hell, I've had better racing on BeamNG and Wreckfest. WRECKFEST.

Cons:
 6 years and it's the same cars, same tracks, with the only new cars being cars that have come out in the last 6 years.
6 years and still no rally, or ANYTHING. Going around a track on pavement is not the only motorsport in the world
6 years and the AI STILL IS DUMBER THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN. You can't race at a higher difficulty because the while you try to work your way through the pack the AI brakes randomly in places it shouldn't, clips your car and gives you penalties whilse receiving none, and generally just sucks. Their Idea of increasing the difficulty is to have you start further back. But then you never catch first place. They literally take off.
The online connection is terrible. I've had this game crash probably about once per hour. so 25 times? Hell, it even cut my computer off. This is NOT a hardware issue on my end. I upgraded my whole rig to play Starfield (another disappointment) and I hardly think Forza is a heavier drain
6 years I've owned a 2004 Acura MDX (this is true) and I can go around corners in it faster than some of these ""race cars"" the handling is crap unless you are on race tires. I....just can't wrap my head around how bad this is. Hopefully it gets better
But if there was anyway in hell to get my money back, I'd take it and never look back. Don't buy this right now. Trust me and the MOSTLY NEGATIVE reviews. There's fire here with all this smoke.",1699149784,1699149784,False,6,0,0.501625120639801025,1,True,False,False

EDIT: I've found a workaround that seems to help this issue, taking a photo during the race (not practice) seems to indicate whether the game will fail to save progress. If trying to save the photo causes an infinite loading screen, then the game was going to fail to save anyway. Buying a car after the race seems to force the game to sync to the online servers, although any further racing I attempt usually will cause an infinite loading screen and remove any further progress after the car purchase at the first opportunity.

Despite the numerous ""fixes"", the devs fail to focus on making the game playable...much less enjoyable to play.  Multiplayer needs to be heavily addressed.  The penalty system and matchmaking appear to be complete failures.  

To explain, you are still placed in races with players who undoubtedly do (or at the very least should) have far lower safety ratings and often skill ratings as well.  There is absolutely NO RACING ETIQUETTE OR PENALTIES for intentionally ruining races.  Two instances I have most encountered are 1) IF you complete an overtake without someone stopping on the apex to intentionally give you a penalty (even knowing full well you have a clean pass and are the faster driver), then you can guarantee that they will ram you off the track in the next corner or target you for a pit-maneuver as if their lives depended on it to get you out of their way, at most receiving a few second penalty (but most often less than 2 seconds worth);  2) rejoining individuals will immediately disrupt your race, especially with other racers near to you and will often look to get in the way in order to maintain their position after having made a crucial error, all while not receiving a penalty or at worst, receiving a small collision penalty while also running the opportunity to give you one if you hit them or go off track to evade.  In both cases, I have found myself being forced off track or given penalties unfairly (for evading or colliding without anywhere to go) and most often I am sent spinning off track causing me to lose 10+ seconds while the other driver(s) ""get away"" with a few seconds off their total time.  I understand why they do it because the repercussions are MINIMAL at best.

My offered solutions would be ensuring better racing etiquette by including damage (or fix the matchmaking to ensure drivers with similar ratings are in lobby).  This will make the game more enjoyable for those looking more for a simulation rather than as a game to play bumper cars where players are either vindictive or meaningfully ending racing sim players enjoyment of good CLEAN racing.  Multiplayer is a cancer right now and regardless of your skill level, it gets old fast.  For the second instance, devs should extend the period of ghosted cars.  That has two effects, 1) the car that went off and is rejoining will focus on getting up to speed again as fast as possible rather than ramming or parking on apex's, & 2) the cars coming up to pass won't have to evade and receive penalties or accidentally ram into the rear end of the car rejoining.  

Additionally, make it so that people who intentionally send you off track or cause repeat collisions be forced to go a certain speed or gear until the affected individual recovers and continues their race to mitigate the damage of being taken out intentionally.  This would likely reduce the amount of intentional ramming as it would have a near immediate impact on dirty driving as opposed to letting people continue and only lose some time at the end rather than moment during their race.  (I believe there is a similar feature in GT7 where they ghost and are forced to slow for the penalty period...take notes).

The multiplayer could be an extremely fun and enjoyable experience....once the devs decide they want to actually punish guilty parties proportionally AND refine matchmaking.  (To add, currently S-safety rating & 4300+ skill rating).**

I don’t have a high-end PC, however my specs are above the recommended specifications. Even so, I find the game stutters, which is worse in the single player career mode. My frame rate varies wildly from 110 fps – 55fps, despite my selection of ‘60fps vsync’, which the game seems to ignore. 

I tried adjusting some graphics settings, and that produced graphic artifacts in the sky which looked like black squares among the clouds.  

I have also had 2x crashes to desktop in my approx. 6 hours playing the game. It’s a bit disappointing really. 

Hopefully it’ll improve once the developers release some updates. 

Edit:

Changing the resolution target to 'auto' corrects stutter, and maintains 60fps (where as selecting '60fps v-sync' did not)
Updating my radeon drivers to 23.11.1 has removed the need to update shaders every time I start the games and has stopped the frequent 'post-race' crashes.

There is no Qualifying which for a racing game is insane!

There is also a strange lack of iconic Cars and tracks (there is only 20 tracks)

The main problem i found with the game is the lack of AI in multiplayer lobbies. i brought this game with the main intention of playing against AI with a few friends.

It seems to me like this game has been made by a development team that aren't into cars and don't care what the fans what from a game like this.

- Assetto Corsa has much better graphics than this shit

Earning xp for your cars is somewhat interesting but gets anoying really quickly, and all the talk about 'forming a bond with your car' doesn't amount to anything; you need a new car for every tournament anyway.

As a long-time fan of the series who has been playing since Forza Motorsport 2, who has played every game since then (including the Horizon series), who has pre-ordered the Ultimate Edition of every game, and who has invested thousands of hours of playtime in the series, I am at a loss for words.

This is my first Forza that I've played mostly on PC, where I can switch between PC and Series X thanks to Cross Progression.

Turn 10 has promised a lot in the past, the trailers often looked better than the finished games, but never has the gap been as wide as it is with this installment. At no point does the game look even remotely as good as the original trailers, even with the maximum details on PC it doesn't come close to the video footage shown in marketing events. 

Visually, the game fluctuates from ""quite respectable"" to ""really bad"", the latter especially when a vehicle model appears again somewhere that was copied over from an old game. ""From the ground up new"" this is not.

The ""career mode"" is one of the most boring campaigns I've played in the genre, the AI drivers are dumber than ever and the content has been greatly reduced. Fewer tracks, vehicles and features but more bugs than ever. Crashes, disappearing track textures and geometry etc. are part of the game experience here, the list of known bugs is longer than some PhD thesis.

Something must have gone wrong during the long development time. It remains to be seen whether Turn 10 can pull it out of the mud. At this point, I wouldn't recommend the game even to fans.",1698833933,1698834240,False,791,16,0.958662927150726318,12,True,False,False

AMD 5700xt
32GB DDR4-3200

I play at 1440p on medium/high settings with a couple of things turned off and get a pretty consistent 60fps.  When I first ran the game I had to tweak a couple of settings to get rid of stuttering in the cut scenes (e.g. starting practise, starting the race, etc), but all good after that.

Honestly I've never come across any of the game breaking bugs others mention - no missing career progress, no game crashes, no infinite loading screens, etc.

For me the driving in this game is the best forza has felt in a long time, and thanks to the new penalty system (although it needs refined) has made multiplayer racing way more rewarding.  No more people ramming you off track to steal a position, no more people taking massive cuts to save seconds per lap whilst you stick to the racing line, etc.

Does it have issues?  Yes.  The car progression stuff is annoying, but they've already made big changes to the level requirements for unlocks, and I'm confident they're going to continue to improve it all.

The physics and car feeling are modeled well in my opinion, even when playing on the keyboard!
But I would have preferred a practice/qualifying/race structure in single player rather than practice/race for a predefined race length. I understand multiplayer does offer that.
Graphics are very nice, night/day and weather is fantastic.

As a long time Forza fan, yes it is still kinda entertaining, yes it still has nice physics and is an overall *meh* game. 

But I don't recommend it for the following reasons:
- The performance: It doesn't matter whether you set the graphics to Ultra or Low, it looks like a ten year old game and the models are just poor. Not to mention constant frame rate drops and crashing, it took me 30 minutes of messing with the video settings for it to be somewhat playable
- The Game logic itself: You can't upgrade your car with credits they have implemented this weird points system where the more you drive the car the more you can upgrade it. They also force you to do warm up laps before races in career mode(which btw is just a bunch of lazily slapped races together with no coherence). Pretty much it's a racing sim, which you cant sim your what you want?
- Car Selection: Lots of cars I just don't see here, there's a lot of odd special Forza edition vehicles but nothing much past the year 2008, feels like a massive downgrade from prior Forzas

Needs more tracks and to better graphic optimisation.
Recommended for simcade player but for an arcade player may be to boring and repetitive.

This makes the progression a lot better). Visually the game is not even close to what was promised. The Performance even on a decent rig is disappointing for the visuals. 

The physics though is a perfect balance of fun and realistic(?). The game also runs beautifully on the G29 after some tweaking. 

Overall, just not worth it in its current state. If this game was built from the ground up, it definitely needs to keep being built cause it is not even close to being in the state that it should be in,

Update: Can't even play this game without losing my progression after every few races due to the infinite loading screen issue. I just cannot bother with this game anymore.",1697315508,1698675202,False,4,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,False

I have played every Forza since FM4 and grinded nearly all of them out at max difficultly 
I know I dont have much playtime in it yet but I can already see how the game is going from my perspective
The good:
-The graphics look amazing
-The tracks are all decent (imagine they are planning to add more
-The cups so far are great
-Car selection is not bad on release
-I have had a ton of fun racing and grinding, I actually enjoy the car levels personally
-The car leveling is really not that big of a grind at all. My cars become half or over half way to max level after a cup

There definitely are a few bad's to this game but I don't find it to be the end of the world like many others personally  

The bad:
-CP are a bit strange, I do not mind the car leveling system at all, but do wish instead of CP (Car points) I could just use my in game currency to upgrade
-The forced practice laps (3 laps usually) before racing are a bit tedious, helps level up your car as its more laps around the track, but its a bit annoying its required to do it (EDIT: You can skip these, its just hidden in the menu's :) ) 
-Ai can be a bit stupid at times, even at max or near max difficulty. They do make it a bit harder than other Forza's/Horizons to actually race the Ai so I am finding a challenge more with these in this game. But there are the moments when I am just a bit confused
-A little confused why some things (such as listening to the exhaust when modifying the car) are missing, that were in other Forzas.

Now for physics, I would put it somewhere in the middle. I personally find the physics from a controller perspective to be decent. I do not have a complaint about it. I will be plugging up my sim wheel next, I have just never been into playing Forza with a wheel as I grew up always on controller.
Car sounds so far are not bad, not as good as AC or other games similar, but for a AAA I find it to be okay and still pretty close, especially fun with maxed out transmission hearing the sequential whine when ripping down the track.

At the end of the day I do see why this game is getting some of the hate. But I still think it is a decent title, and worth base game price. I always enjoy these games regardless and from previous games, I know the devs will continue to add more to the experience.

A lot of the cars are old models from previous titles, making them look dull and allowing you to count the polygons. Graphics overall are hit or miss, if the sun is in its golden hour the game looks great, but if it's noon everything looks like plastic. The career is slow and the AI is unreliable, it varies from insanely aggressive or passive which makes the pack of AI cars (5th-14th) turn into a demolition derby, making it hard to pass anything while the front of the pack pulls away. 

The reason I bought the game was to experience my rosy retrospection memories with my friends again (from FM4) and it's not even possible. Career feels grindy and stale with the AI not sticking to their race lines (either they push themselves off the track to avoid you or they have no problem sideswiping you/ramming you) which causes you to get stuck behind a large pack of cars all while the top 4 cars pull tens of seconds away to where it's very difficult to catch back up unless you've grinded your car level to max it out for the event. Also many of the cars brake in random areas which can be really annoying. A slight bend leading to an open straight and the car you're drafting breaks hard causing you to ram them and get a penalty all while allowing the front of the pack to pull further away. Any car you do manage to pass is never competitive enough to overtake you again unless you go off track, it feels like once you pass cars they forget how to fully depress the gas pedal. 

No car radar makes it hard to judge where opponents cars are in cockpit and the tracks feel muted through a direct drive wheel. Game feels half baked all while asking a triple A price. Live service is not an excuse to put out a half finished game.

The next day I can boot up and get a stuttering mess between 37-60 fps and my gpu utilization will bounce from 20%-99%. Sometimes I can trick the game by maxing out my settings running a lap or so with stuttering. Then exit and re-enter the race to find the frame rate is buttery and smooth for the rest of my gaming session. This method does not always work though and the optimization is so awful that I cannot recommend this to anyone in the game's current state.

I've been trying both controller and wheel (TGT-2) and have some thoughts to help those of you curious about FM. I race with no assists.

For the wheel, the FFB is actually pretty decent once I got the wheel working which isn't supported annoyingly. The FFB accuracy is a touch under GT7 if you consider it a direct competitor and of course ACC/iRacing but way better than the likes of F1 2023 (feeling the limit is important). To my surprise, I could feel the edge of the grip, the weight transferring around, and what the car was doing most of the time. Update 1.0 added some good improvements especially with the tire/tyre model. Throttle control and trail braking are a thing which is nice for the more experienced racers. 

The RPG system is so-so but I did feel like a proud papa raising my cars up in career mode, feeling the changes the racing components were making on performance. I can see how many racers don't want to deal with that for every car though but it is what it is. Just make a free race and turn all assists on for auto drive quick leveling while not actively playing.  

Speaking of tuning, I'm usually pretty lazy about this in other sims and get setups other tuners but I'm actually liking figuring out my own setups with a loose front for rotation to get that corner exit boost. This is where I believe the RPG system has a purpose in that as you upgrade components and tweak your tune, you see the changes and understand the puzzle in how to piece together a competitive set-up. Shameless plug, look for my tunes in game. 

The tracks all look amazing. For now, there are only 20(?) with some variations in layout but according to T10, they will be doing monthly updates so I imagine things like the Nordschleife, Monza, Fuji, Daytona, etc will be added incrementally. Yes there is a bug where the track and/or environment disappears, reminiscent of Rainbow Road in Mario Kart, which I think is really just the shadow realm invading my reality. It's super fun when it happens on the last lap or two but my muscle memory accepts the challenge! 

For the AI,  P1 and 2 are surprisingly quick sometimes and the others have some pretty liberal driving standards but it kind of adds to entertainment value during the race. Choosing to look at this as an opportunity because lets be honest, I've never met an A.I. that didn't want to punt me off to the realm of shadows, I consider these A.I. races as more practice for ""chaos avoidance"" in multiplayer. By racing smart and choosing the right opportunities, I've been able to put their shenanigans in my rear view mirror, watching as they fly off into Barry R's firm embrace. 

For controller racing, I think with practice, anyone can be just as fast with the wheel if not faster, especially with that birds eye from behind view. The inputs have that same nice feeling as the Horizon series without the ""twitchiness"" of F1, GT7, and well pretty much everything. Forza is the best out there for it's amazing controller handling. 

For the sound design, the engines are a 7/10 with similar characteristics that I'm used to from other sims. The contact sound would benefit from some variation as no matter the degree of impact, it's always the same ""clunk.""

For multiplayer, I found even at a 4700+/5000 rating there are still bozos everywhere in lobbies but I've had some really good clean battles too. Either put it on pole or employ maximum chaos avoidance by starting from the back and letting all the clowns fly off into Barry R in the races opening turns and you'll be good. The level of competition isn't as stout as iRacing, ACC, or GT7 but driving cars other than meta is always refreshing (finally the WEC Champion Corvette!). Hopefully the skill level improves and the top split races can be better in the future. With the Netcode pretty stable, it's definitely possible to have some thrilling wheel to wheel races with fellow skilled sim racers even with the dreaded low latency warning. Coming to a close with a final note on the format of the races, there are multiple series with multiple tracks per series instead of the same track all week. Variety is the spice of life and it's sure tasty presented in this fashion. 

Overall, not being overly entitled and ignorant to the complexities of designing a multi-platform video game, I'm more forgiving when I'm mostly having fun. I don't expect my racing sims to hold my hand through some story arc (I'm looking at you F1) so I don't care about that as I'm just here to go flat out. It's nice to have something to just pick up and race without so much seriousness around my rating like iRacing, ACC, and GT7. Is it perfect? No i.e. bugs, crashes, mid-tune freeze ups. Is my fun factor outweighing these cons?  Not anymore after 70+ hours of heartache with all the bugs, especially on the wheel.

Forza Motorsport has been needlessly review-bombed on Steam IMO. It plays just as well as I remember back on the Xbox 360 when Forza first crushed Gran Turismo, taking the crown for racing sims.

I have experienced absolutely none of the problems other players have claimed. Their problem is that they're likely playing on potatoes with HDD's.

I enjoy the new RPG-like element of unlocking cars/upgrades, levelling up your driver and/or car. The graphics are SLICK. Cars beautiful and aplenty. You can tweek whatever aspect of the car you like. Works great with an Xbox controller. My only complaint is the lack of licensed music - which isn't really a problem on PC.

If you're a ""gearhead"" and love motorsports, this is the must-have title. There's many 100's of hours worth of gaming to be had here.

- Can buy any car you want as long as you have credits, I guess.

The bad
- FRR is inconsistent and too generous
- No yellow flag system
- AI drives like you don't exist, some tracks (Nurburgring in particular) are a death sentence because what do you think happens when you and 23 cars take the first hairpin and nobody knows how to give each other space?
- Difficulty settings are either a complete joke of a cakewalk or searing pain, no in-between
- Default car tune settings are garbage, if you want to fix that it's off to YouTube with you
- Default wheel settings are garbage, if you want to fix that go back to YouTube guides
- Stability issues galore for us PC players
- Qualifying is only a thing in multiplayer, for SP you only have ""practice"", target lap times based on difficulty, and the horrendeous AI to deal with
- Can't change parts if you're on track, have to quit the event to do that (so what's the point of practice then?)

The ugly
- When everything gels together, it's a game that feels fantastic. When something goes wrong, it goes REALLY wrong. It feels slap-dashed, barely put together.

If it was just a bad game, I'd accept it more, but this is a potentially good game... Potentially. That's a lot of potential being wasted. There is no way the game as it was released and as it stands currently is the intended experience. There is no way this isn't unfinished.

So yeah, congrats Turn 10, congrats Microsoft. You made a fool out of me for buying day 1 and expecting something that would work and not require so much tweaking to even get it to run with a wheel. And when I do get to play, shame on me, I'm the fool for expecting the AI would be anything more than what it is. It's either a pushover or rolling roadblocks that want you dead, but regardless of difficulty, they won't slow down or stop for an obstruction, they will push you, crash into you, PIT maneuver you. 

Frankly, if I wanted that kind of experience on purpose, I'd just go back to Forza Horizon 5's multiplayer.

The car list is nothing special, I guess they are going to trickle cars in as updates or paid DLC (kind of like how FM5 has started doing paid cars every month).
The car leveling system seemed to try and evoke the feeling of progression in Gran Turismo 1-4, but it falls flat if you don't do the career mode.  They need to implement some sort of XP boost (non paid!) tied to player level, car class, and/or manufacturer affinity.  As a completionist, grinding every car to 50 is unattractive to say the least.

In my 20 hours so far I've only managed to actually complete a total of 3 championships (6 races each) because the game will randomly hang on loading screens, and after reloading the save it will fall back to the last save point, which in my case often means repeating several races.

On reloading I was back to the start and have lost my 2 hours of progress.

Due to the way the championships are structured in career mode where you cannot just choose the one you want to play a la Gran Turismo, if you want to race particular types of cars in career mode you are forced to work through all the prior championships.

- AI is terrible, constantly turns into you, or crashes into everything when you turn the difficulty up
- AI doesn't seem to really get much fast between 5/8 difficulty and 8/8 difficulty, generally it's easier on the higher difficulty when using faster cars, due to poor and erratic driving. 
- Game constantly loses progress when applying upgrades between races
- Penalties seem good on the surface, however especially in multiplayer issues arise when dive bombing corners, as you tend to avoid penalties for even heavy contact if you're braking. 
- Matchmaking is terrible, it doesn't feel like they're using either the safety rating or the driver skill rating to match players.

There were many times I wanted to change out a part to give different performance characteristics. Such as the BMW M5, which has tons of power but is very heavy. So you figure weight reduction would be best upgrade, but the first 19 levels all give you horse power upgrades. So you are stuck driving a speeding battle tank that cant slow down until you go grind level 20 to fix it.

Then there's the AI. 
I haven't focused on racing games in 5 or so years now, and still was able to beat the hardest AI settings with relative ease. The mid-field and back make lots of weird mistakes where they go flying off track.

I have been enjoying the game, I play on a controller and It sounds like they have favoured casual controller players of full wheel racers. I find the campaign fun. Horizon is only right there if you want to free roam, drift, find cars do all that stuff but I bought this to race. I like the upgrade system it makes you really want to work on a car you like and others your not fussed about fully unlocking. After a point you have the option to rework your upgrades to go a full engine swap or other. Alot of people are complaining about the traction or throttle control but if your not using a tuning app or website then you'll never get the best out of any forza game. 
Ai system fair it has its downsides, I try to make my ground up at the start and then can struggle in later races but again it trains you into a faster racer. I am on 6/7 difficulty, expert rules and I often get rammed by the AI at the start but I still can generally win most of any race although it can take a few trys. 
Online is good fun I have only done a few online races and find the qualifying first races people are out for blood and to ram you from miles away but this seems to be decreasing as I rank up. 

Optimisation wise, 2080 ti @ 1440p ultra settings, DLSS high quality. Ray tracing only on car + whatever the second setting I get a stable 80 fps lows of 65 highs of 95. I have experienced a black map before and found restarting the game fixes the issue. I have had a freeze on the please wait screen a couple of times and a memory crash once. All things that will be patched I am sure. Honestly performance isn't bad at all just a few gremlins to be resolved, perhaps the issue is with later series cards/drivers/configurations.

I really enjoy this game and I hope with a few updates the reviews will turn around. Don't forget everyone this is forza its not trying to be a professional sim racer or AC.

 A friends build similar to mine (Ryzen 9 5950x/RTX3080ti) runs into the same issue. 
It's extremely half baked.

I just don't know whether I should like it for the things that I find good in it (CarXP, the driving feels great, etc) but my menu's kept flashing like crazy, something that official Nvidia drivers didn't fix either. 

You can tell that some car models are ripped straight from Motorsport 4 but never truly ""rebuilt from the ground up"".
This game was six years in the making; but still reuses assets from 12 years ago. This game was supposed to be a reboot for the series, not a cashgrab.

Lesson learned this will be the last time I pre order a £60 game. 

Firstly i'd say to the contrary of many that the graphics are beautiful but a bit arcady looking at trees and rocks etc but I think the cars look amazing - thats the only positive, let's get into the real negatives which is why I will never pre order with Turn 10.

I have an AMD Ryzen 9 3900x 12 core CPU, Nvidia RTX 3080 and 128GB RAM so not a bad set up however, I, like many others cannot run this game at a stable 60fps and typically see frames as low as 25fps which makes this game completely unplayable. I love Horizon games and can play 4k at well over 100fps so this is just a joke -  I have also checked out the pages they have suggested to improve this but doesn't take a genius to figure out that they simply messed up here. 

Secondly, if you're a wheel user simply don't bother!! Every single car is plagued with horrendous understeer again making the game completely unplayable. You spend hours to gain enough credits to buy a Porsche but can't even feather the throttle without spinning out or tapping the break 10% without spinning out - it's a complete joke.

I don't mind unlike others the car levelling and upgrade system, it took around 7 hours of game play to max a car which I don't think is too bad, plus the top end cars are only £400k which again took around 7-8 hours to get so not too bad imo. 

The career is terrible, buy a car, race it, level it, buy another car, race it, level it and so on endlessly. 

Multiplayer is absolutely incredible, overshadowed by 25fps which again make this element of the game completely unplayable. 

If turn 10 sort out the optimisation and let us play with 60fps and sort out the crazy understeer issue on every car the game imo would be fantastic, until then it's absolutely terrible and unplayable and cannot recommend this title.

Edit: 45 hours played

The game is still completely broken it's been out a month? and still we have infinite loading screens and multiple crashes. I've been in the game today 20 min practice/ quali, game tries to load the race and it crashes. You then have to completely exit the game and reload back in. Game then can't load the event schedule so have to exit the game again. 3rd time managed to get into yet another 20 min practice / quali, get to the race and the exact same happens again.

During the first hour of play, no loss of FPS, then after 1H a sudden drop in FPS (in the menus or on the track), the track doesn't load (sometimes unloads) and I'm driving on invisible ground... I had to restart the game to get back to normal.

Apart from the bugs that spoil the experience, the gameplay is nice, and so is the content (even if some of the tracks and cars I enjoyed in previous installments are missing).


The progression system for upgrading vehicles is personally not incredible (If I'm doing Drift, with different vehicles), having to upgrade vehicles up to level 50 is a real pain.


For the time being, I'd advise you not to pick it up straight away, just wait a while until Turn 10 fixes the bugs.

Je joue à Forza Mortorsport depuis le troisième opus. Je les ai toujours adorés, mais alors pour celui-ci, ils ont fait fort.

Pendant la première heure de jeu, aucune perte de FPS, puis après 1H une chute brutale des FPS (dans les menus ou en piste), le circuit ne se charge pas (par moments se décharge) et je roule sur un sol invisible... Obligé de relancer le jeu pour revenir dans un état normal.

Hormis les bugs qui gâchent l'expérience, le gameplay est sympa, le contenu aussi (Même s'il manque quelques circuits et voitures que j'appréciais dans les précédents opus).

Input settings constantly get lost and have to be re-selected. That is crazy!! Goes back to Fanatec DD2 but I need a custom profile instead.

Did anyone a Turn 10 even tried a wheel with this game? The out-of-the box settings on a Fanatec are a total joke, just look at the reviews on YouTube. Sadly, it looks like Turn 10 thinks a racing simulator is better on a controller.

Cannot hide wheels or the arms of the drivers to further increase immersion level like other sim racing games.

Cannot pause the game from a wheel button (what if you are on a sim rig and can’t easily get out)

Layout/buttons/wheel configuration is saved but randomly gets lost or not loading, having to reselect it each time I loaded the game.

The game is a blurry mess, even with RTX 4090, can barely read the dashboard values, what the hell? FM7 was perfect on this topic.

Head effect is turned off, and yet, there is still drastic movement when braking.

Is the FOV horizontal or vertical and are the units in degrees? (the slider tip is not helpful)

No way to adjust the seat height, angle, or forward/backward to align with real life conditions (unacceptable)

FPS frame rate drastically fluctuate causing stuttering.

Sounds are not Dolby or THX quality and not even close to iRacing or RaceRoom.

No way to disable the heat shimmering effect inside the car/cockpit causing even more blurring (on hands and steering wheel).

Cannot even hide the wheels and/or the hands to better align with real-life setup like most sims already do.

AI crashing into me like they never drove a car before, this AI is not taking any jobs any time soon.

Sound effects where car touches each other is straight from a Hanna Barbara cartoon.

- awesome graphics
- solid gameplay
- too much fun
- 500 cars (wtf)
- can play hours
- great customization and tunning
- great multiplayer format
- Great weather system

Cons.
- matchmaking seems broken, it needs more data I guess.
- People ramming against you
- Bad community
- People play this like need for speed
- Seems like the safety ranks does not mean nothing
- Some crashes, no often
- Some bugs, not often, it's super playable
- a little bit expensive, but I hope no more dlcs in the near future.

What we need:
- We need to separate the game pass gamers from people that we want to play more seriously without crashin each other
- Better car customization, like allowing adding SVG as car vinyls

I express my solidarity with the Forza Developer Team

I want to express with the Forza Developer Team despite the hate the community is sending to you guys, and I aim to the gamers to calm down and refound or stop playing the game if you are not enjoying the game.

Not get me wrong, I'm a software developer, it happens too often, you put in all your efforts and love, and then you ship the product with all your love, and then the people you harass against you despite all the hours you invested here. You don't know how much work and all the effort it involves. I'm not a web developer, but, I just played with game developer tools and it is kinda... HARD, do you love the math on your schools or even in your university? no? it's kinda worse. Math on games is horrible, fixing bugs it's not pressing the ""fix rain button"" or ""fix networking button"", you don't even imagine how to fix a minor bug in the game, and having money DOES NOT FIXES BUGS.

It is sad but is true, it requires investigations, it requires tools, it requires a lot of time that you can't even imagine, so let developers work.

Building proper Matchmaking requires a huge big of data, and fixing physics requires unimaginable knowledge of physics and computer science.

Nowadays games are becoming more and more complex along with the hardware becoming more capable and sophisticated, it's happening in all the games, but this game is worth the money, even in time, in the near future it won't require micro-transactions, and if you are not sure about this game instead of sending hate, please refound, save your money and buy later, or buy another game, period.

Stop the hate, and enjoy the game.

With love to developers and gamers!

fun factor yes its fun to play and drive

physics its alright am mostly a sim driver looking from that not good at all from a forza player (also me) its a huge step up but not there yet, playing on steering wheel fun yes but its not enough info to drive on the limit.

career mode its a boring grind not much more i can say about it sadly enough 

money/leveling system money is a fun not to long grind but the car level is to long leveling to 25 should be the max then u really know how it drives.

This game dont have career mode. What we have its just tours of 5-6 races with extremely stupid progression. 
1) You buy a stock car
2) You drive it to get experience for that car to unlock upgrade parts and upgrade points for that car only.
3) Every race starts with 2-3 test lap and there are NO qualification, you just choose where to start from 3rd to 20th place.
4) This game dont provide fun competition experience for single player. You just need to grind car parts and points, you literally can just drive a car on 1st race, then restart it and race again to unlock max possible config. You can just place yourself on 3rd position without any effort. 

Turn 10 need to play some good games and learn something. Try My Team mode in F1 2020+. See how fun and interesting can be single player progression. Or take old Race driver Grid. You dont need to copy 1 to 1, but can have it for base. This 2 games have most interesting career modes in all racing games i played.


After 2 weeks we have hotfix patch with only 1 string, that even dont fix what described. That how they dont give a f*** about their customers.
We still have infinite loading screen and loss of progress in races. And i am just lucky i did not have issues like crashes, texture dissapearing and other graphical and optimizations problems that many players have.

They weren't exaggerating - the game has advanced tenfold as far as physics and sound quality. The graphics when pushed to 4k are solid and still run smoothly. It's very exciting to see certain cars pop up as available options during career races. There is a feeling of familiarity, and yet everything feels new enough to be interesting. The difficulty and realism settings make it possible to find the perfect amount of challenge for nearly any player. 

Cons:
If you're an experienced player that enjoys tuning the vehicles or even rebuilding them to suit your creative interests - this game is a major step backwards. The career allows you to choose a vehicle out of a group of 3-6 cars or so each time you're advancing to the next race. This is fun. However, you will not be able to tune this vehicle to your liking until the next to the last race in the series at the earliest. The idea of grinding with a purpose - to save up enough credits to purchase the next car you'd like to use and a little extra to customize it? You will not find that in this game. By the time you hit the sweet spot with the car you're currently using then the series has ended and you will never use that car again. Credits are rendered completely useless. I can buy whatever car I'd like fairly early on, but I'd never get to use them so it is pointless. I noticed they patched the game shortly after release in an effort to address this issue, but that just made it to where you could tune your gear ratios or suspension geometry for the last 2 races of a 6 race series, instead of the very last race in a series.

Overall:
The game is so amazing, and it's a shame that they effectively removed the ability to tune or build a car custom to your liking. No more putting a 3.5 liter NSX engine into a '96 civic hatchback and converting it to all wheel drive to see what happens. No more installing a water-cooled flat 6 into a '72 Porsche. I cannot possibly imagine how the developers were able to put their mind to improving every statistical metric of this game to such a high degree from the previous installments - only to let the game be, subsequently, completely Fucked Off by restricting all of the tuning/customization. Inexplicable.

TDLR:
Hard to explain, but the lack of freedom during the career makes grinding way too grindy. Credits are without value. Save your actual money and just play Forza Horizon 5 some more. You won't be missing anything.",1698313715,1698313715,False,3,1,0.502328276634216309,0,True,False,False

The price of the game is ridiculously high for the amount of content that is provided. Sure, you have 500+ cars or whatever number the developers boast, but the majority of it is cars from previous franchises with almost no changes. The game quickly becomes repetitive and you'll pretty much experience all the game has to offer within the first 10 or so hours of gameplay.  

The developers saw that people complained in Horizon that super/hypercars were too easy to come by so they decided to completely go the other direction and make buying and modifying the cars a complete grindfest. In their defence, they have heard the criticism from the community and scaled down the levels for most upgrades, however personally i find that the car level system just doesnt need to exist to begin with. Why can i not just upgrade the car i want to from the beginning instead of grinding 3 or 4 races (+ practice sessions) before i can even change cosmetics? 

Next major complaint i have are the bots. These are by far the worst bots in any racing game ive ever played. Bots in Assetto Corsa are leagues different than FM. The bots in this game do not leave you any space, you cannot go 2 wide into a corner in most cases as they will just run into your line. Braking early? prepare to get rear ended and sent into the shadow realm. Not only that, the bots will randomly just run off track, which does add to the realism, but when it's happening at least once a lap on average, something is definitely wrong with the AI. On tracks such as Le Mans, bots will get an unrealistically fast slipstream on the straight and sling shot all the way up, however being even almost a full car's length near the proximity of the bot's path will cause them to immediately slam on the brakes and not overtake resulting in no actual contesting of positions. If the developers even just implemented FH5 bots the game would be way better.

The handling although more ""realistic"" compared to the Horizon counterpart still feels a bit janky to use. It is playable and within a few hours you will get used to it and is of least concern in my review, however new players should keep in mind this is no where near simulator status such as the likes of AC or iRacing. This does sit in between Horizon handling and full Sim handling which isnt completely a bad thing..

To conclude, i will never recommend this game to anyone, even hardcore Forza players. There just isnt enough content to justify spending the amount of money the game costs. It does feel like mostly reused content/assets but a step back in certain fields. The only thing this game has going for it is the graphics and large car list.

They had all the time in the world and yet they delivered another half baked live service title with half it's content cut out and half it's frames dropped.  Usually when you get a sequel you say ""Ehh it's just more of the same"" but here you say ""Ehh it's just LESS of the same.""

It's really sad that we gave up all the zany fun available in Forza 4 for ""The freedom to go full sim and forget casuals"" a decade later and we have a stale, sanitized, open world flag diving game with magical grip (that still hasn't done fucking Japan!) and a stripped down Forza 4 with half the tracks/features that you can feel salivating over your credit card.... which I have no doubt they will re-casualize to suit the Horizon games-pass throngs.

The Good:

Physics do feel better without being a huge departure, still the best controller experience in town

Sim aspects, fuel, tire wear,.. It's nice to see this stuff actually meaning something now.  Though I think there is more room for improvement and they have a history on backsliding on realism.

Weather and day/night.  You can actually see at night now! tracks have lights! and the rain looks and feels pretty good.  Please don't strip it out of multiplayer again.

New tuning options, very nice.

The Bad:

Horrible PC performance, constant frame drops, screwy settings that override each other or don't take effect properly.  I went out and bought a 4080 and it still runs like shit.

Tons of inexcusable menu crashes... Load tune, crash, save tune, crash, start race, crash, change car, crash, join lobby, crash, leave lobby, crash.

Never mind the long wait times, how can you only have 1 open hopper per week?  We need at least two, a fast and a slow (C/S, B/R, A/P).  Also I don't care if some twitter assholes want P Class, where is this stuff communicated/voted on in game? Can the people who actually spent $100 on this shit have the say instead?

Where are all the quality of life improvements?  It still takes far too many menus to get out of a race, it's still impossible to see which tunes/paints are getting downloaded from a central menu. There is still no way to favorite cars, there are still no in game clubs (remember when you could share tunes exclusively with your club?!)...

The race AI Race Marshall is dog shit, I could hard check people out on a sweep and never catch a penalty but I get 4.5 seconds when some clown reenters the track sideways in front of me?  Does my safety rating even matter/function?  I maintain an S, my rank is quite high and still wind up playing bumper cars.  I like having some slower people on track to remind you of your progress (I hate Blizzard style over-bearing matchmaking) but I'm not cool with a lobby full of Twisted Metal larpers.

Where the eff did all the tracks go?  Hell we even lost layouts on the tracks that we still have. A lot of FM7 tracks didn't belong in certain class hoppers but that doesn't mean I wanted to see them gone. RIP Nordshliefe, Monza, Alps, Brands Hatch, Daytona, Hockenheim, Long Beach, Rio, Prague, Road Atlanta, Sebring, Sonoma, Top Gear, Yas.

LIKES: I really do enjoy the physics in the game, particularly with a controller. The early road cars in the game do seem to have ridiculous understeer, but some of this is remedied with car upgrades. I don't mind the car progression system either now that parts are attainable at earlier car levels. The dynamic weather effects and lighting can really look superb at times.

DISLIKES: Like many others have noted, cars and the car paint in particular can appear ""flat"" in some lighting. Reflections, even just when viewing cars in the garage, can appear jagged and unnatural. Some car models and cockpit views lack detail. Ray-tracing is nothing close to the initial marketing the game showed, and to me the visuals vs. the performance hit is not worth keeping on (RTX 3080, Ryzen 5800X, 32 GB DDR4 RAM, Gen 4 SSD).

NEEDS FIXING: Overall PC optimization and stability. I have not experienced hangs or persistent crashing like others, but cinematics before and after races are a choppy and stuttery mess. Framerates drop for no apparent reason on specific parts of certain tracks, no matter the amount of traffic. My FPS also dips from mostly constant 60 FPS to 30-40 FPS after gaming for 1.5-2 hours even when settings are unchanged. The settings menu itself is a confusing mess.

First of all play ability:  For some they can't even play the game. For me personally I had 0 issues everything maxed out on early release, just low frame rate. Then the Official release date came by, 0 patches, and the game became unplayable for me. 1/3 my play time is fixing the game to play it. I had to go to windowed mode, turn off ray tracing just to get a few races in. After the latest ""hotfix"" witched isn't even a guaranteed fix for a bug in the intro series the game has become unplayable again with random crashes and hanging up on loading screens.

Second Major Flaw/ Lie:  ""From the ground up"" but has FM7 glitches you can recreate putting inputs in 1:1. Some car models like the Miata mx-5 & BMW E30 M3 are straight ripped from FM4, This was noted by die hard fans in the Forza forums they are dissecting the crap out of this game. Online play is easily manipulated using p2w cars that seem to be bale to ram others off the track and not be affected by other cars. A pit stop glitch to save time on tracks you have to pit stop on which is insane, and cars from different classes getting into lower tier races. Example a P rated car in S rated race. 

Third issue by design: Car leveling to upgrade. This solely exists to push the Xbox Game Pass, it has no other purpose. It's made it so ppl are afk lvling vehicles they want to race and it sucks.
 
Fourth issue multiplayer & penalty system: Matchmaking does not work, You can have a high A/S rating with 4,800+/5000 & still get into pure rammer lobbies. The penalty system is a great addition but needs tweaking. Rammers can abuse the penalty system and victims of rammers get penalties. Penalty for going off track that slows you down shouldn't exist, a slight tire over the edge in some sections can give you as much as a 4 second penalty, meanwhile there are corners you can cut to gain time and you get no penalty.",1698216412,1698216905,False,4,0,0.523869752883911133,1,True,False,False

I first played 5 days before release, graphics were surprisingly terrible on all ""ultra"" settings. The game ran ok besides some random freezes and crashes. On official release day NVIDIA released a driver, I figured it would fix the terrible graphics issue, not at all. Everything is very pixelated, especially car textures and vinyl designs. It looks terrible and nothing like the gameplay in their videos.

The game is rather ""plain"" and nothing excites you to keep playing. Multiplayer is all categorized races that are 20 minutes apart so you end up doing a lot of waiting in practice mode in between races. There are also a bunch of random annoying things like you can't change or move your camera view while installing rims in upgrades.

Track still disappears, weird glitches here and there, randoms crashes and bugs...

Positive: For being an actual race driver with SCCA and NASA, the force feedback is one of the best i have experienced. You can understand what happens at the wheels and get a good picture of the load transfers as well. Not masked by tons of random effects that seldom appear in the steering of a real car. None of the ""but its what math says"" but feels like crap foolery of other ""serious"" sims or random uncontrollable loss of traction of grand turdismo for example. This makes the driving really enjoyable at the limit of grip which is really what this is all about   ...............      when the game works. 

And this is really the disappointment here. Soooo tired of AAA studios hyping their products to the moon like its the next step in human evolution and then serving you with this kind of piece of crap. You really get the impression they take consumers for granted.
When it work like it should, the leveling is just frustrating and plain dumb. First thing you should be able to do even with a stock car is at least adjust pressures and alignment and change tires... not slap some random stupid parts before you can even be allowed to do that. And i'll pass on the terribly boring grind to even get close to be able to do that. With each and every single car !!!  What a pain. You don't transform back into a beginner every time you drive a different car... why should it have to be so here ??
FH is already a arcade bonanza, you'd think they have taken some of the cheese out of this one but no.

Overall I still cannot recommend it. Maybe once the leveling will be fixed, as well as the randoms glitches, and the track wont disappear...
This could haven been the best out there... just saying.

Save your time and money and go buy something else.
Physics were nice and this could have been decent, car leveling is terrible: you might have skills but let's artificially make getting the best out of the car as long and painful as possible.

I play most racing games including but not limited to iracing ACC AC AMS2 Forza Horizon etc etc..  and for me this perfectly fills a gap between Forza Horizon and something like ACC or iracing.  There are a few concerns I've read regarding this game and I'll try and touch on a few,  ultimately though live your own life and try it..  you can always refund it if you don't like it

Performance -  The game runs fine for me..  I have everything maxed in the options with no FSR or dynamic up and down scaling nonsense..  though I did turn off ray tracing but that's whatever to me and I would rather have more frames..  using a 9700k 6800XT and it stays well above the minimum required 60fps (though you could run it locked at 30fps but no thanks)

Graphics - This will always be a matter of opinion..  but for the most part it looks good.  There are times the colour palette looks a bit washed out but you could tweak that in you graphics card settings if you wanted I guess but its not that bad in my opinion.  When you're  in the car on the track it looks good enough..  replays are where you notice some things in the back round like terrain textures are a bit off but its whatever.  The complaints I've heard about car livery resolution are down to dynamic scaling but like i mentioned earlier I have all that crap turned off

Handling - It felt a bit off at first but a few tweaks to my wheel settings and its great now..  sure stock cars drive like your tyres are melting..  but once you add some more aggressive geometry and sticky tyres the handling is really quite enjoyable on a wheel

Progression - ""I cant  just  buy a car and do everything to it"" ...  that may be true but it really doesn't take long to unlock points to add upgrades to cars by driving them..  I quite like how it is really,  you get a car.. 
drive it..  then make it better after each race..  I mean its driving game after all.  I feel like most people complaining about it are the sort of people that have 1000 cars in Forza Horizon and every single one of them has a twin turbo V8 V12 V10 if you know what I'm getting at..  I mean whats the point of this being the same as Horizon?  I feel like this is a much more mature approach and I'm getting old these days and appreciate it.  Single player has the usual sort of selection of classes to build cars to race in but ultimately multiplayer is where its at here.  I don't have a PS5 so I don't play GT7 but at least now there's something similar to be found here which is exactly what I wanted

Edit :  So I've racked up an additional 70hrs now and just thought I would add some more thoughts

Tracks - They are vastly superior to previous Forza offerings..  in the past Forza tracks felt lifeless and smooth made from low resolution mesh.  You couldn't take them too seriously as they all just felt off. Now they are on par with anything on offer elsewhere..  The average user probably doesn't notice but anyone into sim racing with a wheel would notice the difference between FM7 and this one. There's just way more detail on the track and around it,  can't wait for Nordschleife to be added next year to see what that's like.

Progression - after 70hrs I Still don't care I have to level up a car..  they even patched it to make it easier..  it literally takes a 10 lap race to unlock almost everything..  and yet people will still complain no doubt

Performance - still no problems to report 

Multiplayer - Still waiting to see driver rating system evolve over time..  its not bad but not perfect..  there doesn't seem to be a big enough gap between the best and worst players for matchmaking..  but over time it will probably get dialled in.  Its still fun though and I like the structure of weekly races

Closing thoughts - I feel like this game is intended for people that like GT7's multiplayer,  or Sim racers looking for something a little more casual and fun..  or even something with a more accessible structure to multiplayer.  For everyone else there's Forza Horizon.  Personally having played all previous Forza Motorsport games this one is easily the best,  maybe that's because it was intended for somebody like me.  But there will always be a place for Forza Horizon alongside this game and that's how it should be",1697557054,1698148277,True,2,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I’ll start with what I liked. 
~The Good
The physics are pretty good, I played plenty on both controller and FFB wheel, the new physics defiantly make the controller experience better, I don’t know how, but you can feel, see and hear the limits of the car and get a good sense of when the car is on the edge. That’s about it tbh, sort out all the problems I explain below and it will have better longevity. 
~ the bad 
Career mode racing is too Arcady, there’s no qualifying, instead you can just choose a starting position which includes a potential bonus of credits (not car points which you actually need to upgrade cars) if you place 1st-3rd. 
Race lengths are a major problems for me on career races. Doing a 4 lap race is just too short, too short lived and doesn’t feel like it’s worth doing the practice session before when its only 4-5 lap races, which usually equals to about 10-12 minutes of actual race time. 
500 cars and you have to level each one up if you want to upgrades, oh yes, them days are gone when you could just buy any car of your fancy and upgrade it to a class of your choice. Choose wisely cos you gonna have to grind. 
Performance/ graphics is utter dog crap. I don’t get how these games are coming out, demanding higher and higher end GPU’s, when the graphics are not impressive at all, track road texture is just blur, as well as the run off areas like the grass and sand, the windshield looks not existent unless there’s reflection there. Like seriously, just add some wiper marks to show some texture and depth to the windshield. the rain affect on the windshield is just so poorly done, literally eurotruck sim has very decent windshield rain effects. Just a shame. 
FPS jumps over the place, the in game counter ranges from 60-90 fps constantly, like seriously it’s flapping between it non stop. Despite this game play is still fairly smooth for me, no noticeable stuttering, as part from loading screen stutters and occasionally cut scene stutters 
No VR support and devs have said they have no plans to add it either.
ONLINE
online is just ruined by an unfair penalty system that seems to only punish drivers who get rear ended or pushed and bumped off track. the dirty drivers never seem in my experience to get any penalty after causing collisions with me  
AI 
Seems to have used the same AI as wreckfest, AI will for some reason, move over from the inside to way way out into the outside where you may be driving and just ram you. AI do not care, they drive as if you aren't there.",1697283044,1698144182,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Performance is completely random. Sometimes it boots windowed, running at 18 fps. So I have to boot it multiple times until it decides to run. Settings will randomly change on their own, going from max to min. This doesn't change much however as even maxed out this game looks like a PS2 title at worst and a PS3 title at best. For me anyway. Others it looks amazing. Others with the same setup, it looks worse. Who knows. We aren't playing by any rules here.

Speaking of rules, the AI does't play by any. They follow a rigid line through the course. They will not break from this line, going straight through the player if need be. This means that once you take a position, the AI will not fight for it because as long as you sit on their line, they literally cannot pass you. This assumes you made it past them without them pit maneuvering you. For which you will pick up the penalty.

The penalty system in this game is so fascinating. Ive been run off the track, rammed and torpedoed only for ME to receive the penalty and the other driver to go on his merry way.

This doesn't improve in multiplayer because this is Forza. No one knows how to race. No one tries to race. Sorry I didn't realize I bought Wreckfest again. 

Despite the game's marketing loving to use the phrase ""built from the ground up"" this is factually false. The models for the majority of cars are still from Forza Motorsport 4. They do not work in this new lighting. They stand out garishly against the new models. It isn't built from the ground up. Sure maybe they tried but they got tired about 3 feet of the ground.

But the worst part is, I don't think this game is acting on good faith. The screen shots are not from PC. Content that is touted in screenshots, videos and descriptions just straight up isn't in game. Multiclass racing, like the splash art for the game and highlighted in the game's intro, just isn't a thing you can do. Drift events don't exist despite being in the first video you watch. Drag tires are showcased in customization but there are no drag events. And the most egregious thing? Race cars do not have events. You heard that right. Only road cars have events. Race cars? Like the ones you bought as DLC? They literally don't have events associated with them. They just sit in your garage. 

Not that you'd want to use them anyway. I don't think they were really meant to used because they do not handle like high aero based cars do. They slide all over the place and genuinely feel like a standard road car. 

I love love love seeing people with 30+ hours getting refunds. Not me I guess. Been fighting with Steam for a week while others around me get this nightmare out of their library.

Edit 1: After doing the afk strat to gain car levels, i can fully say that this progression system is worse than expired tuna. 4-5 hours to level a car up from scratch is NUTS. Also, penalties are worse than any game i have seen. I was running 2nd and went off the track by 2 inches coming off of a moderately low speed turn and the game gave me a 1.3 second penalty for something that already mildly hurt my lap time. It happened again later but i slowed down and lost 1 second on the person ahead, just to get a .8 second penalty for 1 inch this time. If i were racing in a tight lobby, my race would be over at that point, but i still finished second. Still very pissed about it and the devs need work this out before i knit with their g-spots.

Edit 2: New update capped the game on multiplayer to 60 fps. Not only that but the progression was only changed a little. But the shit doesnt stop there. Online is a fucking joke. Coming from the 9th fastest on maple valley at the time of this. Crashes, not severe enough penalties, and the guy who pit maneuvered me got NO PENALTY. Settings for your input need to be manually changed every time you load up the game as well. These devs need to put on their clown suits and piss off. Honestly they would be more productive if they were homeless. FUCKING JOKE GAME, but i will still play to keep updating this review. But as it stands right now,
DO NOT BUY THIS SHIT ASS NUT SACK OF A GAME.

Edit 3: I have lost my fucking mind with this shit it is actually a pain to my everyday life. The tire wear is so fucking inaccurate i was running p5 after the best recovery drive of the century and the notification that my tires only had one lap left popped up. THEN MY FUCKING TIRES GAVE OUT AND I FINISHED P12. I HOPE THE DEVELOPERS NEVER HAVE CHILDREN AND I HOPE THEY DIE A GRUESOME PAINFUL DEATH.

I'm a casual PC sim racer who mostly plays iracing and ams2 with the occasional dirt 2. I do have a full wheel and cockpit with triple screens. This is not a sim, but it is a simcade and for me scratches that itch when I want to race, but don't want to take it too seriously or only have enough time for a quick race.

I did a lot of research on some wheel settings to use in my Moza software along with in game and then have been tweaking from there. It definitely isn't as bad if you have a good starting point. I never expected it to be sim level and was actually surprised it wasn't as bad as people were making it out to be.

On that note, the cars, especially the starter ones are super understeery. As you level it up you can unlock things to improve that. I just learned to adapt to it and give the car what it needs and I have been able to hit all target times on level 5 difficulty with expert ruleset in place. 

You'll read a lot of reviews about bad AI. I honestly think that aside from iracing AI in private sessions this may be one of the better ones. If you aren't a perpetual dive bomber who expects everyone to get out of your way even if the corner isn't yours you often will have clean races. I do admit that the race starts are a little odd, but it's easy to adapt to if you have some racecraft. You don't win the race on turn 1.

I personally enjoy slowly upgrading cars as you get experience with them. It can be a grind if you are Uber competitive and want everything right away or play nom stop, but for casual fans who like to learn their car and just enjoy the race it really is quite fun.

Multiplayer is hit or miss and I haven't done much of it yet, but honestly had cleaner races with AI so far.  

The main bug I've ran into is that I have to rebind my pedal inputs from my Moza pedals every time I log in. It is irritating, but takes 3 seconds and doesn't break the game for me.

Overall, I enjoy the game and think many casual racers who don't always have the time or energy for iracing/acc, but think FH5 is too arcadey with not enough proper track races or proper racing rules in place. 

I hope this helps someone as I'd like to see people having fun with this and continue to get updates and attention for a long time.

I haven't played since 4 on X360 so here's my take;

PC needed a Forza Motorsport and this delivers. It feels true to the franchise but better in every way.

The physics are where this really shines. Cars actually feel like they have real 'mass'. Lift over-steer feels legit, you can rotate a FWD car realistically with a touch of brakes. A light car will get very unsettled on curbs and a heavy touring car can eat them up all day. It just feels....correct.

Graphics are great. 4080 on Ultra/DLSS Quality everything else Auto gives ~100 fps consistently with minimal hiccups. Dynamic time and weather is very good. RT feels very decent and doesn't feel like the performance hog it was in FH5.

I do really like the car leveling system. You win money to buy cars from races, and use car XP to unlock performance parts. I like this. It gives you a reason to progress with a certain car instead of just putting a million dollars into a Skyline and cheesing LMP cars. It gives a new facet of progression to the game to keep it fresh. There's difficulty settings for everyone's taste, the practice sessions with challenges are great, and the risk/reward based grid positions is awesome.

The negative reviews are bewildering to me. Are they from Horizon players and hardcore simmers? That's not what this is. Its pure simcade. Realistic racing on track that you can enjoy with a controller. It has actual events and class racing. This is a huge draw for people like me that want a sense of progression and car building from a realistic enough, yet casual racing game. Not a sandbox with nothing to do that takes forever to configure properly.

TLDR;

If you want Forza/Gran Turismo on PC, this is it, and its great. If you're coming from Horizon expecting something similar you will be disappointed. If you have a VR headset and a full racing seat looking for something like AC/PC2/AMS2 you will be disappointed.",1697041873,1698078891,True,1,0,0.52449566125869751,0,True,False,False

Original review:

I got an error code every time I launched the game that said my cpu was not supported, so I thought the performance problems were related to my cpu.  I stupidly went and upgraded my cpu, motherboard and memory.  In the end, it didn't make much of a difference and I feel like I wasted my money.

This game really needs a few more months in the oven to fully cook, its very clear that the game is feature-incomplete and buggy. Drag/Drift mode isn't in the game despite already having all the needed parts. 

Multiplayer on the other hand, its great (again when it works) Car homologation makes it a lot more competitive. Netcode very stable even in poor networking conditions, wheel to wheel racing is very much possible. 

Car level progression still need more overhaul to make it less grindy, and remove the level-wall for upgrades, I don't mind having to grind for CP but don't limit my upgrade choices behind the levels. (also for the love of god, make the levels model based rather than a specific car)

Whilst my PC is capable of a stable framerate running Cyberpunk and Forza Horizon 5 at 4K, somehow Forza Motorsport is unable to hold a solid 60fps at 1080p. The pop-in is atrocious while in faster cars especially down the pit straight on any track.

This game should not have shipped without holding open betas to stress test the underlying infrastructure.

Weight transfer is pretty good especially in fast corners.
Tires go off a cliff if you go over 60% wear forcing you to pit or lose +2s per lap making online races have some degree of strategy which is always nice. 0 stops with Hard tires or 1 stop doing Medium to Medium / Soft to Hard / Hard to Soft.
Multiplayer has been incredible for me (S Safety Rating and 4994 Skill Rating) people expect 20 player lobbies to be as clean as community custom lobbies and the reality is that you can't make a random matchmaking be that good lol. Rammers were a thing the first 5-6 races but afterwards i haven't had a single incident (over 35 races) 
If you're one to complain about the upgrade system in Multiplayer, i have a solution for you: Just play Spec Events, they're the most fun anyway having the GT Tour in it.
While i agree the game has big issues like optimization on PC (Rx580 / Ryzen 5 5600 can run at 60fps with FSR) ,  i still encourage people to give it a shot, and to not completely give up on it after having 5 bad races, like most people in the reviews did lmao. 
Game has great potential, i can promise you after a few hours of multiplayer once your Safety Rating goes up you'll enjoy your time there. Who knows maybe you'll join a community and start private lobbies with no rammers at all for the rest of your days  :)

If you like cars you'll find it ridiculous that you're essentially always forced to race cars with stock or street tires in a racing series, lol. 
Aside from that, in the campaign the AI is still really bad. Maybe mildly better about crashing into you but I have all of the difficulty settings maxed out with no assists and you either pass every car in the first corner or two and get first, or the car in pole is ahead after the first two corners and makes a ridiculous 5 second gap over everyone else, every time, no matter what.

Developers - DON'T ADD NEW MECHANICS THAT MAKE YOUR LESS FUN. Especially for car enthusiasts!

As others have stated, the car feel and physics are amazing. When you're finally on track racing this is the best forza, and maybe the best simcade controller racing game out there. Close racing, decent car selection, and an attempt at competitive multiplayer.

Unfortunately, you'll spend 99% of your time crashing on startup, waiting for intermission countdown, retrieving multiplayer events, and applying tune setup. The game will hang on any number of loading screens forcing you to quit the game from task manager and re-launch. 

Once you load a track and get behind the wheel, there's a 20-30% chance the game will be a stuttering mess despite running at a locked 60fps the other 70-80% of the time. There doesn't seem to be any correlation with car, track, number of racers, etc. Just rolling the dice that after 20mins of practice and qualifying for an 8 minute race you'll be able to play and the last nearly half hour hasn't been a complete waste of time.

And to top it off, you'll need to reboot the game no matter what between successful multiplayer matches because the game will fail to ""sync multiplayer event lists"", whatever that means. You won't be able to stay in the same lobby if you find a good one. You won't be able to run it back against the guy who won by 0.002s over you. You WILL be placed back in another lobby with rammers, trolls, and did I mention you need to wait another 20mins to see if the next race will work?

- Recommended if you want to have a GT7 like simcadey racing game on PC and are willing to bare the painful process of the game being finished while investing with a hopeful optimistic mind.

As a GT7 fan I was and am glad this game is a PC release and I do enjoy whenever the game is stable. But there are so many stability, QOL and even fundamental gameplay issues that makes the experience really frustrating. I can't believe this got released in the state it is now. Either they skipped the QC/QA or they just didn't care. I would be more understanding if this was from a smaller developer or if this was an early access title.

This game is truly disappointing and should be avoided at all costs for the time being unless you enjoy mindless grinding and depression.

The verdict is what you would expect from a 2023 game I have to admit, and I wish I did not spend my hard earned money on yet another unfinished game.

Im not a fan of the grind mechanic for leveling cars. My time is limited as a dad of 2 so I just want to hop in my classic FM cars and drive away. Also please let me skip the Preparation races, It's bland and boring.

Multiplayer is improved with the addition of skill rating and safety rating (how likely you are to crash into others)
They remodeled the Subaru 22B
Sim wheel usage has improved. stock settings kinda suck, but with some adjustments it's much better than previous forza games.

Cons:
Poorly optimized for PC. 12700k + 3070ti can't run ultimate graphics at 1080p.
Bad car upgrade progression. Grinding for ""car points"" to upgrade your car is extremely annoying and boring. (they released an update that made it less grindy than it was before, but it's still bad.)
Uninspired car list. Very few cars are actually interesting. 
Boring single player. None of the single player even uses the race cars, all of them are normal cars, also no edurance races, or any races you even need to worry about fuel/tires. AI is either cheating levels faster than you or not even a competition.
Bad graphics. Downgrade from FH5. Weird texture issues. Bad shaders. (read update below)
Many 10+ year old models are used. just recycled from FM1,2,3,4 without any improvements. Several cars are still very inaccurate to their real life versions. S15 Silvia is a perfect example of this.
Physics are garbage. Understeer simulator 2023. I have bruised my fingers using controller because it just feels like the controller isn't responding rather than like understeer physics, so i end up pressing very hard on the controller buttons. (this is mostly due to the sense of speed being very bad, so it feels like you're going slower than a car would normally be able to handle a corner, but if you look at your actual speed, it's decently reasonable.)
Bad track list. Didn't even come with Nurburgring Nordschleife
Shortest list of Car Pass DLC cars of any Forza game
Huge list of bugs and issues
No wheel offset option even though FH5 had it
No drift modes (online or offline)
Has drift suspension but no drift tires

Notes:
It seems like they are heavily setting this game up for post release content. How much of that will be free vs paid is yet to be seen.
I bought the $100 ultimate version and I have deep regret for doing that.
I'll likely still keep playing the game despite how bad it is just because there isn't really any other semi-sim racing games that I can play on controller and be casual with.
I really hope that post release game updates fix all the issues that the community has.

(Update): Graphic Notes:
Higher render scale looks better than any of the other settings. I've been running 150% render scale on high preset and it looks A LOT better. 
8GB if vram isn't enough for ""Ultra"" textures (even at 1080p and 100% render scale). There is glitches were if you run out of vram, textures just don't load (like track textures, so looks like you're driving on nothing). 
High textures look really good though, didn't notice a different at 1080p to be honest, and the game uses a bit over 7GB of vram at that setting.

Final Verdict:
Don't pay for this game unless you're purely looking for a casual semi-sim online racing experience.

I never usually down vote a game that's released with bugs & glitches (Cyberpunk being a great example) but this game should still be in ALPHA testing. Along with many others, I get bizarre graphical glitches where the track and scenery turn black and you don't know where you are going. It freezes for several seconds whilst racing both on and offline. Online is terrible as the freeze throws you back down the field of runners. It's hit or miss whether the games launches with the above issues, or just crashes outright. BTW I have a 4070 Ti and can only run this in 1080 as 2k just kills it. Graphics have to be on medium to get any kind of playability from the game.

Game issues are consistent with previous versions of Forza Motorsport. The first 3 AI cars seem to have a secret stash of Nitrous Oxide but when you finally manage to overtake them, they drop back multiple seconds as if their speed has just gone. Just make the grid like how most RL motorsport is where the field is bunched up and consisten, THEN you can choose the difficulty more appropriately. The problem is you put it on an easier setting purely to catch the top 3 of the race where you should be racing on harder settings with a closer field. It's just stupid. 

I honestly don't know how you can go from Forza 7, which was equally as dogs**t with it's stability and crashing, but at least ran smoothly whilst in a race, to this? I just don't get it. And then, to have the audacity to charge £60 for it? I feel like Cartman where his mother is constantly trying to **** him.  

If past games are anything to go off, then these issues probably won't get fixed which is a shame, because it does have the makings of a good game. Incompetent developers or corporate greed? Both????",1697984748,1697984748,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Are you too? Why don't you find out. You can buy it and try it I think, just do racing and don't look too much around in regards to other things, which I hope some of them they will patch out and fix (like the AI awareness but I do like that the opponents have some balls) but honestly?

For me I always loved these games, starting with (Horizon 5, 4 and) Motorsport 7 becasue for one it feels like these games don't need to be modded because of the sheer amount of the cars available, tracks could be also plentyful but ones that are available are really great and this is the crux of my experience:

The driving is fantastic I think but it also helps that the game looks gorgeous in essence and these are the reasons why I literally love it. Like, really the colors and the lighting are phenomenal I find.

What do you think? Did you try it already?

I said the game is good, with potential to be great but this time I will say the game have the potential to be good, great only if major updates are on the way, fast...

The simulation side is decent, nothing in the level of Assetto Corsa, but good enough to have fun and feel the difference between cars, tires, race conditions, etc. The sound is also good and clear how it changes with certain upgrades.
This I will not change...

The graphics are good in some areas, but it's clear the game have some big problems at PC, the car panels all look horrible, pixelated and blurry, it's not important but when the same cars have great panels in Forza Horizon 5 and in some angles the cars just look plain worse than a 2 year game made by the same people it's perplexing how and why this happened, there's dips in performance and some circuits are just a nightmare for the FPS with a 3070Ti even lowering graphics settings, I also had problems with my graphics settings just resetting by themselves...

The circuits are nice and varied, but not having more hurts the career big time, you will race a lot in the same circuits with slight variations. Turn10 said we will have more in the future, like Nordschleife next year but for now it's way too little...

There's a good selection of cars but it's clear a lot will be available later, maybe through events but possible through DLC and/or car packs...
But some you see and wonder ""why this one instead of some other car in a lacking category?"". Did we really need 4 Corvettes C9? 4 Modern Camaros? Or 3 Cadillac 2023 prototypes with 3 different colors instead of the same car with 2 other optional liveries? A lot of Aston Martin cars that fall in the exact same category and same performance? And then only three V8 SuperCars and a severe lack of historical tourism racing cars...

The menus are kind of ""meh"", they serve their purpose but look outdated...

The first championship is a taste of how the career is structured, 3 laps of mandatory practice before the each race, where the AI also go around ""hot lapping"", but really just getting in your way and this ""practice"" serves no purpose, because you choose where to start (P3 to last) before starting the race, it's more realistic, nobody goes to a track day and just jump directly into a race but this is a game and having no option to avoid this gets tiresome quickly...

And talking about the career mode, it's bad.
It's stiff, not interesting, with some questionable choices and clashes directly with the ""build your car"" premise.
The first championships you mostly have the choice of 3 or 4 cars, but as the championship develops the max car class allowed advances, which doesn't make sense, especially when the AI only upgrade their car if you upgrade yours, this need to make the championship go hand to hand with the atrocious upgrade system just doesn't make sense when something like practice is mandatory, it's ""flexible"" where doesn't make any sense. Not to mention only the first championship of each row is unlocked, the rest unlocks only when you complete the previous one, you can't play in the order you want, period.
And guess what, most cars you buy, race and upgrade will be throw into the garage after using for a championship, only the bottom row of championships have free choice of class per class, going from C to S...

The car upgrade, as I said, it's atrocious, they recently updated to have more options from level 1 and 2 but this still only cover a few options like air filters and wheels, horrible doesn't make justice, but the worse is that you need CP (Car Points) to apply the upgrades, so you can't pay with money and your driver level serves no purpose, most of the time you can't have all the upgrades you want or unlocked, you have to compromise or go back to grinding car levels with until you have the CP needed, and all the progress is only for that specific car, it`s not shared even if you have a identical one. 
I get it not wanting to shower the player with money, cars and unlocks right away but who thought this was a better idea? You don't form a ""bond"" with a car because you want to build that car, you get stuck with that because grinding for new upgrades in a new car is wasting your time unless a championship ask for a certain car. Just look the amount of AFK XP farming videos there's in YouTube and you can see it's just a huge problem...

The AI is unbelievable dumb, ""half of a meter outside the line? Better stamp the brakes and throw the car into the race line, if it's a chicane it's almost certain I need to stop the car""
""Car on the outside line? Better punt him into the shadow helm""
""End of the first lap? Time to get stuck in that position until the end""
""6 laps race? Better put 30 laps worth of fuel into the tank""
The first turn in any circuit looks like a demolition derby...

Also had a problem with the controller I'm using, a wired 8BitDo that never had any problem in any other game, but in this one it struggled to control the game menus, switching constantly between controller and keyboard, it was fine racing with it but the right analog also activated  the D-pad, bringing up the car behavior overlay sometimes and you had to take extreme care selecting any option right after the practice is over, the fix?

Having played the game for about 8 hours now, and having upgraded several cars. I can understand where the mixed reviews come from. There is some questionable design choices that were made with this title. Some cars have drastically different engine audio from Forza 7 ((However some cars have much better interior audio)), The only bug that I've ran into so far is the infamous disappearing textures, however, looking past the bugs. I have had nothing but fun with this new title. Physics feel much, MUCH for refined, Forza 7 had an issue where no matter what cars just seemed to either have massive under steer, or the rear end would kick out if you so much as touched the gas ((and that's with something using racing slicks)). Graphics look a lot cleaner than 7, not perfect, but a lot better. But the overall game play experience is much more enjoyable.

This game isn't a hardcore sim, Forza has never been a Hardcore sim. I think the closest comparison I can make with this game is Imagine GT7, but the cars don't feel so stiff, They feel how they should

At the end of the day, if you're looking for a Racing game that feels good to drive; a good active multiplayer system, and overall is a nice experience, Forza is a good buy",1697920655,1697920655,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Yes the game is frustrating at the moment, but compared to other titles out there its OK. Definitely feels more like a race sim than Horizon 5, and is loads better than the utter trash that is the latest NFS release.  As always with Forza there is a huge selection of cars and numerous customization options. The variety of tracks is nice, the weather effects are cool. Overall it looks good and sounds good. 

That said DO NOT use the ""automatic"" graphics settings, configure the options manually and run multiple benchmarks to see what configuration performs best for you. Automatic mode tries too hard so the frame rate is all over the place, everywhere between 20 and 120. Using a mix of Ultra & High manual settings I can get a steady 60FPS out of my RTX3070 without stressing the card too much. 

The AI is frustrating, to say the least. One individual driver running alone may be very skilled, but put a pack of them together and they're all over the place. My favorite part is when they ram you or spin you out and the player gets penalized for it. Yes it's totally my fault the guy behind me entered the curve too fast, ran up inside my rear quarter panel and shoved me completely around. Also suffers from the same issue as Horizon 5 (and Horizon 4 for that matter) where the most skilled AI drivers always start in positions 1 through 3. So if you turn the difficulty up to a challenging level they build up an incredible lead during the first few laps while you battle traffic, then when you finally get clear of the mob you can't catch the lead drivers before the race ends despite running faster lap times. So you have to leave the difficulty at a moderate level where you can get to 1st place in the first two laps, then spend the remainder of the session just racing the clock. 

I will give this title credit in that the player can pick where he/she starts in the grid, but the closer to the front you start the less of a cash bonus you get for winning. So you have to choose between a challenging race and actually making any money to buy new cars. A better option would be for the most skilled AI drivers to start at the REAR of the pack, so they have to fight traffic just like the player does.

Finally, car upgrading is very frustrating. The latest patch makes car upgrades unlock at lower levels but you lack the points to actually buy any of them. Meanwhile AI cars have loads of suspension, tire and aero upgrades from the start. In career mode why am I racing against AI opponents that have upgrades I can't access myself yet?

My Specs. Asus Strix mother board, 12900k, 3080ti, 4tb samsung m.2's, ddr5, ultragear 4k monitor. 

Menu: I wish it would keep the car your are currently driving locked in. If you're leaving a race to upgrade the car you still have to go into the garage to find it in order to upgrade. The main menu / upgrade menu can be dark and the colors don't seem to match? I've adjusted all the settings to try and achieve a good picture. Not an issue with my other games. 

Leveling system: It's alright.. I get a little impatient/bored getting a new car and have to level up in order to improve it. It takes more time if you are a person who likes rivals or open class racing online. You have to keep backing out of the races to upgrade the cars and then jump back in to achieve better lap times. It just adds more time and laps.. lots of laps.. and more laps.. I believe this will cause some people to research the faster cars and stick with those instead of what they may enjoy to offset the time factor of leveling. It would be cool if it was manufacture based leveling instead of individual car leveling. Currently if you by the same car that you already have level 50 then you have to start all over again to upgrade it. For me personally it's a buzz kill. 

Practice: I wish it was more like real qualifying but you are able to choose your starting point on the grid after but never 1st or 2nd. If you complete practice and decide to upgrade your car before the race then you have to start practice again. or try and skip it. 

Career: I wish you were able to change cars mid career instead of starting over. I get it though. sticking with a car and upgrading it. Night races can be especially dark even with brightness up. My cars seem to hesitate when exiting some corners and AI seems to be on rails with some corners. Currently on level 5/6 or 7 A.I. I do like that you can adjust the penalties. 

Pause menu: It would be cool if they brought back the pause when you hit resume it would slowly bring you back to speed like in the older game. 

HUD: Lots of things happening on the hud. but thankfully you can turn them off. Almost makes it feel like an arcade game with everything on. 

Multiplayer: This is fun but the penalty system is not in favor of the good drivers getting rammed.

With how much this game got delayed its a real shame how bad it does a lot of the basics. Even something as simple as the career mode only has events for road cars. 

There is no events for any race cars, no GT3, GT2, GT1, LMP1, DPI, F1, IMSA GTO, Group 5, Group 6, Group C etc etc. They have cars for all of those major racing categories and the only place to use them is in events you make yourself because they didnt have the foresight to curate it themselves. Granturismo got blasted for doing this last year and I have no idea how T10 didnt improve on what they missed out on.

Another problem is the weird grouping, GTE and GT3 are paired together which isnt right due to the large speed differences between, even worse those two are paired with V8 Supercars and Nascar which are WAY slower then both. GT4 is paired with other random classes as well and you got Group 5 cars from the 70s paired with IMSA GTO from the late 80s/early 90s which is ridiculous. The groups need to be broken apart, there is enough content in the major categories for them to not be paired together so this needs to be fixed very quickly else a bunch of cars are just never going to be picked. 

The good thing is the gameplay itself is quite fun, FFB still isnt great but can be tweaked to be very good. The expectation of a track every month and constant new cars with the car pass and spotlight car events will give this game life into the future but as it stands this needs some serious fixes asap. For any motorsport fans also you will notice a lot of the popular groups like GT3 dont have any modern cars in those roster, in fact there is literally 0 homologated  GT3 currently racing that are in the game.

Just like GT7 it seems a lot of people are looking at this and saying lets wait a year and see what they fix. Its easy to assume a lot of the problems will be fixed but as we have seen with GT7 they just added 3 cars every two months and added a VR mode for the two dozen people with PSVR 2.

Technical:

Whatever they've done to the game engine has made it a lot worse performing than FM7 and FH5, making it barely playable on a low-spec machine at the lowest settings, and more demanding than Cyberpunk 2077 on a high-spec machine on the upper end of graphical settings. FH5 also had ray tracing support and the performance was great. It arguably looks better graphically, and runs decently on gaming handheld PCs (65-75 FPS, medium settings, 720p on an AMD Ryzen 6800U @ 15W TDP). The new FM on the lowest settings on the same machine would struggle to reach 40FPS even with FSR, while looking absolutely terrible compared to FH5. 

With Forza's main competitor, GT7, gaining access to fast SSDs, Polyphony managed to virtually eliminate loading screens. Turn 10 has done nothing on this front despite having access to the same hardware, and this new FM goes through loading just like any of the previous Forza titles, while advertising it on their blog as ""the most technically advanced racing game ever made"". It does not have a superior physics model compared to the old games. Tire and fuel management systems have been in tons of racing games already. 

I have requested a refund as multiplayer has been crashing to desktop for me.

Gameplay:
Nothing's really changed with the singleplayer campaign. The events now allow you to upgrade your car throughout the series. Customization is locked behind car levels. Gone are the days when you could go straight into upgrading a new car that you have just bought. Starting every event with practice but no qualifying is weird. F1 does a much better job with this as they allow the player to choose to do practice and qualifying sessions when loaded onto a track. Forza, being Forza, just lets you pick your starting position, and difficulty is determined by how far back in the grid you start, and only reward you when you make it all the way to the podium from the back of the grid within a span of a few laps. This is not the realism they advertised. A much better way would be to have qualifying session determine your starting position based on your lap time (which indicates your car's performance + your skill level), and reward you for beating your rivals close to your skill level. Incentivizing starting as further back as possible and using dangerous dive bomb techniques is a terrible way to demonstrate what racing should be like, and it shows in how other folks drive in multiplayer. 

All in all, if this has been the direction of the new FM all along, I would much rather they remaster FM4 at this point with updated graphics and UI instead of wasting resources on making a worse version of the previous FM games from the ground up, and then try to sell it as new and innovative. The only upside is that it has inspired me to revisit FM4 through emulation and that turned out to be a lot more fun than the new FM.",1697891483,1697891483,False,5,0,0.524335265159606934,0,True,False,False

At first based on the ads and the dev interviews i thought finally we will get a game which will focus on actuall racing on racetracks around the world. Sadly i came to a realisation that the devs probably never seen an actual racing series before, and seemingly forgot how to make a videogame too.

A lot of people did not like the car leveling system, i personally dont really care that much, in fact i think it plays quite nice into the builders cup theme. However the whole campaing is the builders cup which means you will NEVER race any racecars or any fast cars really (the fastest car was ferrari roma or a 911), luckily there is a weekly racing series where you can actually race similar to a racing car, but 5 races for a week is a but underwhelming.  Dont get me wrong the racing is kinda fun with the racecars but if i want to race roadcars i just play fh5 not motorsport. Another importatnt point to make is that there isn't that many racing cars in the game (and almost no new car since FM7), and the ones that are new they are locked behind a paywall.

The game has a lot, and i mean a lot of deal breaking issues. For me it was the saving issues which prevents me from progressing, basically i have done the same racing series 4 times now and i still have to redo it again and it is UNACCEPTABLE for something ""worth"" 70$. The DLSS features does not work, and i have major stuttering and sometimes having trouble reaching 40 fps on medium (with an i9-11900K and a 3060Ti). 

The last point i would like to make is that the AI is worst than ever, basically if they are in front of you they drive like Verstappen, but immediately they get behind you they drive like Latifi, not to mention they go around the track without having a slightest idea of knowing you are there too. The first three is always much faster than the others, meanwhile the rest is a joke, so good luck finding a fitting difficulty.

There is nothing career about it.  As another review stated ""its take your daily driver to a track day simulator"".  The penalty system must go!  Everytime an AI car bumps me I get a notification about being assessed for a penalty.  I turned off the visible notification but I still have to deal with the sound everytime, its distracting.  Turn 10 simply added replay-ability (and I use that term loosely) by making you have to level up every individual car to buy parts for it...  It what miserable world to I have to race a car to be allowed to buy parts for it?!?! Thats stoopid Turn 10... On top of those gripes there is the crashes, and I don't mean on the track.  The game locks up and closes.  This has happened to me 3 times in 13 hours of play and I well exceed the recommended PC  requirements.  
Honestly if you gave me the option of playing this or GT7, I would pick GT7 everytime.  I'm not some biased fan either.

Terrible technical port on PC and another case of a game launching in a broken and unfinished state. :(

Unknown to me the automatic game boost function (overclocking) of my motherboard was applied (perhaps after recent BIOS update) while my manual voltage offset of -0.0125V was still active.

This didn't affect Windows in general or make any of my other games unstable or crash but with Forza it straight up crashed. Going back to my manual overclock settings fixed the issue.

EDIT: Update. After playing 19 hours: Handling model feels nice, penalties, tire changes, fuel consumption and animated pit stops feel really good. Visually the game is sweet. Track selection is pretty good although would have liked to see Fuji to make a return. Would recommend if it weren't for the frequent crashes during single player and especially online play.

Unfortunately due to a myriad of issues this will probably not be the case and now I'm really wishing I could get my money back.

The good: The handling model is noticably different from FM7. Cars generally feel more apt to understeer rather than oversteer now. The addition of tire compounds is a huge change - now, in longer races, you can legitimately run multi-stop strategies to get an edge over people when raw speed isn't enough. This especially works well with the addition of truly dynamic weather and time of day, which informs what tires you will want to run and when you want to pit. The car list is solid - 500+ vehicles to choose from. There's been other reviews complaining about the list being down from FM7 but realistically, you should be able to find something you like here. People also seem to have issues with the new car leveling mechanics - basically instead of just buying new parts with cash like you've been able to in past titles, most parts remain locked until you hit a level requirement with each individual car. In actual gameplay it works wonders in giving the game a strong sense of progression that never dies out like it might in older Gran Turismo or Need for Speed titles. Most importantly, the multiplayer offering is such a glow-up that it's actually wild, and for the first time I actually look forward to multiplayer racing in a racing game. I do have personal issues with how relatively high-commitment it is (sort of akin to competitive CSGO or Valorant) but now there's skill and safety ratings that ideally match you with people who drive both fast and safe. The penalty system goes a long way in making it fun - people are automatically and accurately penalized for things like ramming, cutting the track and making illegal passes, it's nothing compared to an actual human race director, but it's a huge step in the right direction. It's especially satisfying to see people getting disqualified from a race for griefing or just plain driving carelessly.

The bad: First of all, performance on PC. I shouldn't really be struggling to run this game on a Ryzen 9 5900x and an RTX 3080, but I am. I can mostly hold 60 FPS in races, but the resolution is clearly being bumped down from 1440p even with DLSS enabled, in addition, in-race menus are a stuttery mess. It doesn't look like NVIDIA has even released drivers for this game which is weird. With that out of the way - the Builder's Cup just isn't good. It's got to be the worst campaign they've made for a Forza title since FM5, and I really don't understand what necessitated a fundamental change from the last couple Motorsport games. FM6 and 7 both had fantastic semi-linear campaign structures in which you complete 3 or 4 series of your choosing out of a group of 10, and then you move to the next group of 10 and so on and so forth. In FM8, you instead progress linearly through different series - every single one of them - rather than choosing what you want to play, in addition to that all of the races are the same length, the championships don't randomize which tracks they use so there's basically no replay value and also only about 1/3 of the car list qualifies for the Builder's Cup championships. It feels absolutely half-baked. If you want to engage with the new progression system for all the cars outside of Builder's Cup you usually need to play Rivals (fine, but not something I'd want to do all the time) or race in Free Play, the problem is that Free Play isn't quite built for progressing cars the same way the Builder's Cup is, and honestly, Free Play feels somewhat broken. You can run completely random events, but they won't have practice sessions at all, which is very frustrating when trying to nail down a tune. There was a massive opportunity here to let people organize their own championships with fully random events whenever Builder's Cup runs out of steam and instead let the car leveling system dictate the game's progression, it would have given the game immense legs beyond just waiting until every Wednesday night for the live service to refresh, and I'm not sure why that opportunity wasn't taken. In addition while I maintain that this game absolutely was built from the ground up in most of the areas that actually matter (car models are not an area that matters, sorry not sorry), there are some parts where changes have not been made where they really should've been. The effects of car upgrades, for example, have seemingly remained unchanged from FH5, which in turn remained unchanged from Forza Motorsport 3, which is extremely disappointing when so much of the game focuses on upgrading cars. I also find it quite weird that there's still no mixed-surface racing in the Motorsport series after all this time, especially when it has such awesome representation in the Horizon series. And then there's the matter of the live service, which I suppose is more of a wait-and-see kind of deal, but if it's really just going to be extra cars and extra tracks and a new Builder's Cup championship every week then I think I'm just gonna miss out. I really despise how much this series' live elements rely on FOMO - even if we now have two weeks to enjoy the ""content"" before it goes away, I still think that it's not enough. It should be staying permanently.

If I had to sum it up: It has second-to-none multiplayer and there's clearly major overhauls that have been done, but all it has to offer outside of that is the most boring singleplayer racing game offering in a decade, a live service that seems like it's going to be just as banal and a whole lot of potential that feels like it could *eventually* be delivered on, which really isn't what anyone wants after six years of nothing.",1697750186,1697750186,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

[h2]Positives[/h2]
[b]Cars[/b]
The selection of cars, going from hatchbacks to LMPs, etc is great fun. The handling can leave a bit to be desired, with all cars seemingly favouring oversteer out of the box, but still nonetheless very fun to drive.

[b]The Upgrade System[/b]
Working through a career championship, slowly improving the car, tuning and honing it in is a great deal of fun and a good gameplay loop, per car, per championship.


[h2]Negatives[/h2]
[b]Performance[/b]
Boy did they mess this one up, the game struggles on even the best of hardware, poor CPU optimisation seemingly the cause. Those with better single-core performance may have better experiences than myself, but man, what a disappointment.

[b]Graphics[/b]
The performance, previously mentioned, would be somewhat forgivable [i]if[/i] the graphics were up to the standard you would expect of a fresh release in 2023. For reasons I can't figure out, even with ray-tracing, ambient occlusion, global illumination, etc all seem off. Car models themselves, are lacking, with poor texture-work, dated models, etc, it's hard to believe this is the latest, greatest for a racing game.

[b]Crashes[/b]
Know what's fun? Not having the game crash after 30 mins of practice/qualifying leading up to a race, resetting the whole event. Applying upgrades, loading races, even just opening the game, all have led to crashes at some point at another. 

[b]Multiplayer [i](and it's penalty system)[/i][/b]
Anyone who's played Forza in the past will already know what to expect here, rammers galore!
But this time it's different, Forza have a neat little penalty system, designed to curb these toxic racers, the issue, however? It doesn't work. I've had plenty of races ruined now, where another driver has speared into me, crashing me out, and leaving me with a penalty as a cherry on top.

Don't listen to all the negative stuff online. The only thing that is kinda bad is the AI bumping into you constantly when you're in a big pack. Racing when it's spaced out is great. 

Been playing on controller with ABS, TCS, and stability control OFF. Drivatar level 6, Clubsport rules, and brake-only racing line. It's been very satisfying to play. I'd say if you can set the difficulty overall where you get 1st place about three out of ten races, that's a satisfying challenge. 

The 1.0 update improved the leveling system a lot by allowing lower levels to unlock more things. The biggest reason I prefer this game over Forza Horizon 5 is that you're not given a super car or ""special vehicle"" every 5 seconds. You start out with road cars, upgrade them, and progress from there. Certain upgrades very significantly change your car's behavior, and aren't just ""top speed"", ""acceleration"", and ""handling"" like you might expect from an average arcade racer...

A few examples of major upgrades:
-A lighter flywheel gives you better throttle response.
-Weight reduction makes the car feel more nimble overall, and doesn't just ""make the car turn/accelerate faster"". It actually affects how you handle the car's dynamics when it comes to turning, easing onto the throttle, braking...
-A better camshaft gives you more power at higher RPM.
-Certain engine upgrades give you a higher redline to utilize more torque per gear. 
-Going from street to racing tires gives you significantly better grip without the need to tune.
-Various suspension upgrades keep the car's dynamics consistent or even feel improved.

I'm looking forward to discovering how more upgrades affect your car, like the turbocharger.

Career mode is boring AF. Very uninspired. Just a string of races with no sense of actually being in a ""career"".   It's insulting to call it a career mode. To be fair, Gran Turismo's ""career"" mode is boring too.

-Not very wheel friendly without adjusting the stock setup for wheel dramatically
-better than GT (IMO) 
-The patch fixed most of the problems I was having and I'm running minimum specs at 60-80 frames and only dropped once and that was because of a giant pileup on lap one that had all multiplayer cars wreck. (I hit 39fps for 10 seconds) 

-I was nervous going in seeing the negativity surrounding it but I'm glad I made the purchase because it's easily better than most arcade sim racers on the whole catalog steam offers. 

-69.99 is overpriced, this game is worth maybe the standard 59.99 But ya know, economy or some excuse

-skip the campaign. It's just stupid. 

overall rating 7.5/10. 
would rate higher but the price alone is a take away and the campaign was so mid that if I kept playing it instead of multiplayer or free play I wouldn't have kept playing at all

There are major optimisation issues and bugs which cause crashes often even on a card like an RTX 3090. The game doesn't really look any better than other racing games or sims on the market that run a whole lot better.

The single player is lacklustre with the races being too short yet feeling extremely dull at the same time with AI being poor to middling in terms of recognising cars around them.

- Need to re-save the custom control setting (separately plugged in Logitech Pro Wheel, Peddles and Driving Adapter) EVERY time the games starts.

- Find it's best to restart the game after changing graphics settings.

- Graphics look dull, blurry and just poor in spots - I mostly play ""Rivals"" with just one ghost, and in general the game seems poorly optimised - especially with RT turned on and compared to Forza Horizon 5 (for example; my i5-9400f/RTX 4090/3200Mhz RAM combination has no issues playing FH5, FS22, ATS, ETS2 and even Microsoft Flight Sim with graphics on the highest settings at solid 60FPS 4K).

- Sound through a surround sound system is terrible - nauseating in replay mode - and sounds much like driving a car in the bathroom.

- Using manual with clutch is ridiculous unless you change real slow gear like a gumby ...

But the biggest issue is the penalty system. In multiplayer, you're being constantly bumped into, and quite often you end up receiving a penalty for a crash you didn't even cause and had no way of avoiding. As of right now, I wouldn't recommend multiplayer races at all. Even with an S safety rating, everyone is constantly crashing into  you, often gaining an advantage while ruining your race, without even receiving a penalty.

I was expecting a photorealistic and fun racing game that could rival Gran Turismo 7, but what I got was a slight disappointment. Sometimes it looked like a 2017-2018 game with the lighting looking horrible and textures being extremely blurry/pixelated, but most of the time it looked pretty good. Despite the meh graphics, I only got 40-50fps at high graphics + my pc was as loud as a jet engine most of the time. I have a high end pc with and RTX 3070 Ti and a Ryzen 7 5700G, yet the performance was so bad I had to take breaks because of my eyes hurting after playing for 1-2 hours. But if you have a Nasa computer you'll be (probably) fine. Moving on to the gameplay, the career mode is a bit too boring for a racing game. You do 3 laps practise and then do the race. That's it. And from doing that over and over again and leveling up your car you can upgrade it. Instead of you choosing out which parts you want to switch/upgrade, you can just click one button and the game does it for you. The best thing about this game is the controls for the gamepad, they feel extremely nice.

In it's current state I just really can't seem to enjoy it, and therefore I can't either recommend it to someone else.

**Update** with recent game updates, game appears to be playing smoother.  Cars unlock upgrades faster which is a nice touch, as you can get a car to most, if not all, its upgrades through one completed series of races.  

Graphics 6/10
This seems to be the hot button, as it should when a game launches with all kinds of graphic issues.  On the default settings, I experienced both graphics popping in and out, and FPS issues.  I put settings to a Medium, except the cars I have set to Ultra.  Constant 80+ FPS and no graphic glitches anymore. (3060 RTX, Ryzen 7 8core, 32gb RAM, 2560x1440 165ghz Monitor).   Yes, after all that Hype the Developers had about the graphics, I am disappointed like many but the game still looks okay.  I know I don't have the most cutting edge set up, but still wish the game was as pretty as ""hyped""

10/10 Gameplay
This is were the game completely redeems itself to me.  The actual ""On Track"" with the gas pushed, tappign the brakes, swerving around the corners.   From Forza 2005 to this, I am completely happy with how the control responds, how the car reacts, and how the tracks feel as the cars fly over the course. Track selection is good.  I'd really like to see Drag Races again, and Autocross.  Both of which are Track Day staples and should be in a game like Forza.   The car selection is good, as usual, but I really wish Game developers would include more ""average joe"" cars.  You got a Cobra R and SVO foxbody, but no actual iconic, run of the mill 5.0?  Car selection is large of course, just personal ""wish""

5/10 Immersion 
This is were I WISH developers would take note.  They always talk about immersing players.   Okay, then give players a deeper Race Day feel.  Something as simple as during the cut scene hearing a intercom annoucnement ""All racers report to the driver briefing"" or something similar.  I believe there is so much more room to grow here in modern race games.  I actually like the practice laps and simple narration because that does give a small amount of what I feel lacks, but I'd like to see more immersion between the races and in the narration.  Take Sega GT 2002 for example... You had a small garage, that your car sat in.  When you put a car up for sale, it was parked out front with a sign in it and would sell ""in a couple days time"" during the course of the week.  You could hang pictures and trophies, and customize the garage.  Have the narrator comment on the changes to your car.  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY.... (I'm VERY passionate about this next one) settings such as TCS, Stability and MOST important Automatic VS Manual SHOULD BE LINKED TO THE CAR, NOT THE SETTINGS.  Anyone who is a car person, knows details like ""is it a manual"" or classic cars lacking ALL the ABS, TCS, Stability stuff is what separates those cars even further from the modern cars.  I don't get into a 1970s car and turn ""off"" the TCS.  Each CAR's personality is reflected in the real world by this.  This to me is what is missing from games that claim to immerse you.  The sense your growing as a driver.   Obviously this is a personal taste, but its one I believe could further separate a Racing Game in a sea of Race Games where games like Gran Turismo is far...far... FAAAR from its former ""King of the hill"" status in the car race game world.  

Overall, the actual racing on the track really does feel great to a casual gamer like me.  As race games continue to evolve, I'd love to see more emphasis on what actual track days are like with some small attention to details that I think would pull players into the game more.   

For the racing alone, I would recommend this game.  I'd say graphics are not as ""refined"" as I had hoped .  

Forza Motorsport continues to  grow in some places from its 2005 origins, and stumble in other paces, but I am glad it continues.  I hope the game gets support, the Devs improve the system, and players keep the franchise alive.  I am a much bigger fan of the Track race games vs. the open world ones like Horizon.",1697216598,1697644026,True,1,2,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,False

Image quality has taken a huge nosedive without an MSAA implementation, and the game looks way too soft compared to previous entries.

The positive notes are that the improved driving model is nice. But all the touted improvements in the months of marketing leading up the game's launch are nowhere near as impressive as stated, such as AI and graphics. I see no major improvements to the AI over Forza titles, they literally have the exact same behavior as in previous games. They blinding hold a line even when you are far, far faster, yet once you pass them, they don't defend, they don't fight back. If you can get past the car in first place, you will run away from the pack with tens of second to spare.

The preview demonstrations showed an extremely high quality ray-tracing option. That is simply not present in the game. Go watch DF's Weekly video where they have some comparison shots. This game was marketed deceptively, and should not be purchased until all marketing promises are delivered upon.",1697232688,1697639187,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why do I recommend forza as a racing game not this: Simple from what I know of forza I expect to get in get cars and upgrade what I want if I have the resources and just have fun driving cars... this I cannot so for example if I don't like the lack of grip in a car I have to hot lap around like say Homestead just to build car level to do so. Honestly my main issue is the idea of grinding car level PER CAR but regardless my points as of this gamestate are as listed below.

Pros
-Great to drive... normally. So far only the civic has been hard to drive but upgrades that I should have been able to do at the start made it more manageable.

Neutral
-Cars are cheap. On one hand this is nice as I can know that within like a hour I can get really any car at least with VIP but like this is about one of the only saving graces for the horrible car progression stuff and this shouldn't be a saving grace.
-Decent penalty system. From what I have seen usually the punishment fits the crime as it is like ""Yeah I most likely gained a second from that corner cut"" or ""Yeah that was my fault understandable"" but like with any system it isn't exactly perfect so it can punish you twice/thrice by you getting completely screwed over to be going from 12th to 24th AND having a 4.5 second penalty while on a hard to pass circuit

Cons borderline Neutrals
-Level per car: I like the idea of having a limit to what I can do such as the Honda civic can't get race brakes until I upgrade/drive it but I don't like how it is (Edit: ""Oh let's give you tons of grip at level 3 but sorry you're going to have to deal with that power problem for longer than we previously forced you to deal with your handling issues"")(Seriously Devs what is SO HARD about letting us choose how to upgrade our cars(within point limits) at the start I like this system in principle but hate how long it can take to fix issues due to levels such as handling now power)
-Discounts for manufacturers. I can already hear you saying ""Why is this a bad thing it makes it cheaper"" to which I ask you do you really want to max level several cars just for a discount? Like it is a cool thing but honestly it just makes this game feel like a grind

Cons
-Consistent crashes IN MENUS. it is one thing if I am driving around but these crashes are consistent as I just navigate between tabs like literally a bit more of a horizon 5 port would be better at this point.
-Vast differences of AI on same difficulty. To note this at homestead speedway I did either level 1 or level 4 AI but the point stands that ONE was pacing about the same as me... the rest yeah me and the AI had lapped the whole field like 20 maybe 30 laps

Indifferent(things I like/dislike that hold no basis for recommending/not recommending this)
-Replays even local races only store the first 10-15 mins of a race and none after. I forget if a replay showed what I wanted but to me what is the point of a replay if you do a 18 min race want to see how your crashed looked on lap 38 of 40 and because lap 38 is after the 15 min mark it resets before you get to seeing it.

tl;dr: I want to recommend this but I can't recommend a Track racing game with forza physics but with an upgrade system that is basically an RPG style grind rather than anything to mess around and have fun with.",1697029290,1697635287,False,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The game looks like utter garbage at 30fps. So multiplayer is completely ruined and I won't even try to play it. Moving onto the actual game and why it's bad (mainly AI issues). The AI cars in the game are terrible. I run Forza at the hardest difficulty (always have, in this game it's an arbitrary numerical value of 8) and I see bots going off track because their cars are defying in game physics (which are not even close to real life). This has always been a problem, but in this latest Forza, it is absolutely insane how bad the AI drivers are. They will crash into you (IRL this would disqualify them from a race), the AI doesn't brake (no light indicator) in many cases going around tight corners, AI isn't punished for cutting the course, AI can accelerate just as fast as you even if they are off course, AI doesn't have traction issues in the rain, AI acceleration is not proportionate to how fast you can accelerate in the same car, AI is extremely bad at levels 1-5 and doesn't provide competition (my friend races at level 5 and can barely shift my manual rig), levels 6-8 are all the same difficulty, difficulty bonus isn't enough to warrant all the issues playing at difficulty level 8, starting placement bonus isn't worth starting dead last at 23rd. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY 0 INCENTIVE TO BE GOOD AT THIS GAME. The game will kick you 4k credits to play on an impossible TO MOST difficulty. I can't imagine a lay person finding any value in this game, especially since every single upgrade must now be earned with time (not skill or ability to save credits).

I will say one thing that is not an opinion, but a fact: The A90 Supra undriveable in this game. I hope Toyota doesn't play this and see how terribly their car is represented. Snap over-steer is absolutely wild on this car and this car only (from what I've seen so far). The Supra handles like it's on ice skates and will randomly stop turning or lock up the brakes. If you are coming out of a corner, good luck being full throttle in any gear below 4th. I mean come on guys, it really isn't that hard to make a game good. Copy paste FM7, update graphics, add cars, add courses, and we would have all been happy.

Positives
-Physics feel great, clearly made a huge change from previous games. Xbox controller feels great to use, and you will not be disadvantaged by not using a wheel.

-How the game gives feedback for sectors and timings tickles my brain in a good way

-While there is no Nordschleife, I do enjoy the tracks that are in the game, with their many variants

-Multiplayer, when it works and everyone is playing nice, is a genuine fun experience.

Negatives
-Career mode is severely undercooked. I don't mind having events that are short, especially to onboard newer players, but with no way to change race length, and no longer events, all in a game having ""Motorsport"" in the title and featuring GT3 and touring cars feels very contradictory.

-No qualifying. I know for a fact that even before I joined the series, qualifying has been requested for career mode since before I started playing Forza. Its insane to me that this is not a feature in single player Forza after all this time, and really makes me think that Turn 10 is not capable of simulating one lap pace between a multitude of cars on track. Its even more confusing when its featured in multiplayer.*

-Look you go to any racing game, and none of them will have the penalty system down unless their is a human behind it. It still does not make it any less frustrating getting punted off and then receiving a penalty.

-The car upgrade system seems to be updated on the day I am writing this to make things easier, but it still baffles me you cannot buy any upgrades with credits, only car points and being at the right level of car xp.

-The AI have not been developed upon and I sincerely wish T10 would drop drivatars. Just like Horizon 5, you better get a good start on lap 1, and keep P1 in your sights, otherwise the game will forget about the AI after some distance, and not properly simulate their tire grip/wear/physics, allowing them to screw off into the distance.*

-Some car models from FM2 rear their ugly head here. They come from the age of taking a million photos and just eyeballing it in a model maker. These models will literally be older than some younger people that might play this game.*

-Replay system is completely broken right now and does not function.

*These specific points really make me think that Microsoft's heavy use of contractors are severely hampering them. Changes should have and would have already been made to these points by any other dev with this amount of time, but because of severe turnover, they will never get changed.

inb4 1 year later, a bunch of content is added, changes that should have been made before release get fixed and patched in, and the community comes back with ""Wow look at how much T10 listens to us"". Thus the cycle repeats. 

I was really rooting for this one before release with the absolutely abysmal state of racing games right now, but it seems like we have to wait a little while longer.

[*][u]Multiplayer[/u] is solid (when it works, see below). Safety rating / skill rating mostly works on the matchmaking. Have had minimal issues with bad racers with my S safety rating and 4987 skill rating.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]
[list]
[*][u]Car Leveling System[/u] is tedious and boring. Duplicate cars don't share their car levels. Takes many hours to get a single car to Level 50, necessary for achievements and manufacturer discounts (There's an achievement to get Level 50 on 30 cars! I'd say that's 120-150 hours of JUST leveling cars, if not more!)
[*][u]Career Mode / Builder's Cup[/u] is short and uninspired. No career series use anything higher than S-Class. No race car based series. In a Motorsport game. I'm not joking. You're racing E/D/C-Class cars most of the time when EVERYONE playing this game wants to race something, ya know, actually fast. 
[*][u]Replay / Rewinds[/u] are still broken for any decently long race. For a game they marketed as ""built from the ground up,"" this is the exact same issue Forza has had since like, FM2.
[*][u]Photo mode[/u] is a mess. Lighting is messed up, barely works. You think they could take Forza Horizon 5's stellar photo mode and put it in this game, but nope! Apparently not.
[*][u]AI Difficulty[/u] is all over the place. I played on Difficulty Level 5 most of the time. Sometimes I won an 8 minute race by 45 seconds starting 24th. The next I had to start 12th just to win by a few seconds. Same difficulty, same car. I'm typically top 99% on the leaderboards... the AI implementation is just as all over the place as always. Guess they didn't feel like including that when they ""built the game from the ground up"" either.

- The car sounds and physics have really made the game addictive to play

On the Negative 
- The AI's are on par with a 6 year old playing his first racing game, seriously inconsistent and wont hesitate to ram you off track
- The driver level is completely useless, with other Forza's you at least get a cheap car, driver gear or some extra cash. 
- The cars are so cheap money is nearly meaningless. Exotics and race cars shouldn't be less then 200k especially when you no longer require money to buy car upgrades
- Even with the new patch lowering car part unlock levels you don't make enough CP to upgrade a car to make it interesting. Either they need to increase the rate you gain CP or raise the unlock level back to balance this.
- Multiple races I had the track not render in mid race and required to guess the remainder of the circuit or restart .

- There's a lack of real life sponsors on the tracks, which takes away from the immersion that you're on a racing track.
- The CarPG is the most confusing system in a racing game I've seen in Forza by far, you purchase the car you want to rank up then you need to purchase and equip the parts you want on the car. Turn 10 have done this deliberately to increase your play time, this should've been left out because this wasn't in previous Forza games. 
- V8 Supercars are now in the Forza GT category, but there's only two of these which is a step down from FM7. These should be in a seperate category. 
- No NASCAR is included, there aren't any cars dedicated to NASCAR but in other Forza games NASCAR was included in the game.
- The car models should be updated with more recent models, Turn 10 should create their own version of race cars based off of the road cars. This would breathe some more creativity in car models. The proportions of some cars are still straight up wrong, Turn 10 has not bothered getting them correctly even after all these years, even comparing some of them side-by-side. 
- Nordschleife is not included at launch (Coming Spring 2024), Tsukuba not included, Bathurst not included, but you get an Ohio track (The track isn't destroyed by the rammers yet). There needs to be way more tracks in this game that would make the game not become as repetitive as quickly. 
- AI in this game is easily the most dumbest by far in the Forza series, if you hold an inside/outside line then the AI drives off the track and doesn't back off on the accelerator. The AI forgets you're next to them and can easily spin you out or push you off wide.  There are many times where the AI forgets to brake and drives off the track. 
- Career mode takes way to long to actually complete, you have to complete practice laps to actually complete each and every championship. It would be better to to have a qualifying option and actually start the race without being forced to do practice laps. Some of the races take way too long to complete, maybe a QOL feature that allows you to adjust the race length from short, medium and long. 

Multiplayer: 
- The penalty system is broken sometimes, either you push the track limits or punt someone of the tack and don't get penalised for it. The stewards aren't even looking at the race half the time.
- The tracks should changed weekly/daily to increase the variety and replayability, some tracks should be swapped from Touring cars to GT3. The smaller tracks feel way better for the Touring cars than the GT3 cars.
- There should be a multi-class races which include LMP, GT3 and GT4. But sadly that's not included in the game, nor is it included in Career mode. 
 - Many shadow realm entries 

Don't expect anything fancy but expected to get treated as a beta tester for an early access game that isn't in early access but is actually a half-finished product that corporate greed releases while simultaneously laying off half the workforce that is needed to develop the game and release it in a somewhat functioning state.

That's the advice in my head, the scars from No Mans Sky run deep, and yet here I am spending up on Forza '23 (for want of a better way to distinguish it).

And I can tell you, I wanted to like it, I wasn't bought into the hype, there was clearly so much of it around it was unreal, and being a refugee from the PS4/GT Sport era now in PC land, I was prepared for the worst - better to be pleasantly surprised.

So, you'll have guessed by now, that I'm not the happiest camper out there. Let's do a list and unpack...

- UI
- Handling
- Peripheral devices
- AI

That's the sh*t list, but before that, let's talk about what I do like...

The game itself, the way it flows and the upgrades, etc - that's all fantastic. Coming from GT6 on PS4 (I rage quit PS4 land with GT Sport, but this is not that tale) I have long missed a game where it's a case of buying a road car and working my way up to a race car - club racing like that is excellent fun.

And I'm new enough to this franchise to not worry about upgrade points being limited to one car, or over-tuning my car so it's un-raceable, I like to buy a few bits and get in. This is that. If you liked old-school Gran Turismo, this game is for you (mostly). 

The content and graphics aren't half bad either, I'm running a 3080 Ti at 4k, so it's hard not to look good, and if I'm honest, I like RRRE and don't mind their ""overly dated"" graphics. I thought I was a snob, clearly I like a bit of rough.

But let's get to the list, it is most of the game after all...

[b]UI[/b]
The easy one. It's a pet hate and a frustration that games that are ported to/from console don't do it properly. This game is no exception. Half the time there's a back button, the rest it's press escape. The continuity tester should be shot, or maybe made to spend a day with only one shoe on. 
It's not the end of the world, but having to pick a mouse or keyboard depending on what screen I want to get out of is a pain for me, and smacks of poor design. 
Outside of that, it's not so bad. Placing it on the spectrum... RF2 (as it was in '23) is the bottom, RRRE is the top (it really is easy to use, except when you change your mind in track selection) - I'd put the UI closer to the top for sure, it's easy to get to what you want when you want it, just not the way you want.

[b]Handling[/b]
Ah yes. For context I'm using a DD1 and 918 Rim with V3 pedals, a solid upper-middle-of-the-road setup. Day zero I had serious doubts about the game...
Feedback through the wheel was wooden, no ripple strip feedback and just really lifeless, but patience... and I knew there were some settings to change. 
A setup guide was released, and it's so much better. It's not AMS2, and never will be, but it's certainly enjoyable now and the wheel talks to what's going on, I'm OK with that.
So why is handling in the bin list?

This is an easy test... get an Audi GT3, go to Spa, and take it through Raidillon & Eau Rouge. Then do that with AMS2 (you'll need another GT3, doesn't matter), RRRE, AC and ACC.

It's terrible in Forza.

The best I can say is it's like racing in the rain, you get wash-out, then grip, then oversteer. It really does feel like the wet in other games.

That corner is iconic, that car is a classic, and having watched any amount of GT3s go through that bend I reckon I could drive through there with my eyes closed on the right line. Except in Forza '23, in which it's a lottery as to what happens next.

To be fair, it's not so bad in the club (tweaked road) cars, they handle OK, but I'm not looking forward to the higher-class races in the game for sure. In fact I said the exact same thing of Shift 2 years ago. It's the same; Physics that have been applied to some road cars the devs had access to have been cranked up (in the numbers) to make ""racecar"" - and that's just not the case.

I do like to be thorough in my disappointment though, so the plan is one evening to do a test and tune and see if it's a tuning issue for the car on that track. I'm not going to hold my breath though.

[b]Peripheral Devices[/b]
I recently bought a ghetto bass shaker - it's surprisingly cheap to do so,  and it's excellent.
I also run a couple of dashboards - a shift/racelogic dash on an old phone an ancient tablet with full dashboard on it, from the excellent https://www.stryder-it.de/simdashboard/ site. I love the immersion this gives me - in AMS2 for example every gear change is a shift light flashing, then a kick as I change gear - the intensity of immersion that gives is fantastic.
Couple that with crew chief, Fanatec's shift lights on the wheel & mini-dash on the DD1, and I'm well stocked with info while I race. I use all of it.

Not in Forza.

Forza, I'll accept it's day zero (or so) and devs haven't nailed the peripheral apps yet. But none of it works. I managed to get one device working - the large dash. You basically have to point the game to that specific device on your network - which is great, but I have many other devices that are now without info and won't work. 
So, by design, I'm unlikely to be able to use all the gear I've built into my rig. 
And that's a poor show - GRID does it fine, Dirt2 is fine... the list of older games working is right there MS... do the right thing and make it work as per the other games.
Apparently, it has to do with the sandbox game environment. Whatever, that's called an excuse, not a reason. 

[b]AI[/b]
I grew up on a farm, and for many years AI was Artificial Insemination (side note, proud to say I never lost sight of my hands in all the years of working on the farm). I actually wonder if that's the manual that was used by the devs in gathering requirements for this game's AI.
Truly I've not been f****d by AI as hard as I have in this game.
No two ways about it, I've had cars side-swipe me off the track, even if I'm off the racing line, and alongside - maybe it's meant to be a blocking move, but with a 5ghz PC I'd like to think the decision to 'change lanes' could be a bit more snappy and happen before I'm there. If it was real it would be dangerous driving.

And then into the first few corners. This is masterful - the devs have managed to recreate the open lobby experience to perfection. It's a total sh*tfest on the first few bends. Again, I'm at club level to be fair, but there's really no attempt by AI to avoid collisions, none whatsoever. 
If crew chief worked, I'd expect a ""hold your line"" moment, but they'd need to add in some more commentary along the lines of ""Car front, left, right, behind, all closing in on you"" - which would aptly describe the moshpit of the early race.

[b]In summary...[/b]
I sat down to race last night, finally after a busy week I had a spare hour or so. I was looking forward to some Forza, it's my new game after all.
10 minutes in and I was back out. 
All of the above just doesn't make it a game I want to play. It's OK as a game, but the experience is very shallow for sure. 
And I found myself racing a new track in RRRE in 1992 DTM cars. And it was glorious, the ripple strips rumbled, the crew chief called it, and the cars handled well (as they do for that age). I could feel the grip coming on and dropping off. The AI was behaved but assertive. And so on...

I thoroughly enjoyed the race.

And surely, when it boils down to it 99% of us are here to enjoy the racing. Forza has a way to go before I get to that point I think, and I wonder if I ever will when there are alternatives out there.",1697578957,1697579090,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Running a benchmark it says i should run at a stable 60fps but every different track i go to i get a range of 10-60fps. also this game looks worse than even FM6 and way worse than FH5.

Multiplayer is a joke, all the features they implemented in the last horizon games to prevent griefing are nowhere to be seen. People can hit you and spin you out most of the time without any consequence, more often than not you're the one getting the penalty :)

The car levels are pure anti fun measure to retain players in the game but thats exactly what will have me stopping playing after i get my achievements.

Update 1.0:

Today we got the first update for FM, Now you ""only"" need to Level up a car to Lvl 25 to gain full access to upgrades. This is around 1,5h of driving non-stop just to upgrade a vehicle you have no clue will even be good... I still think they should remove lvl caps from the upgarde menu entirely. Give some other rewards instead like money or make profile customization and maybe give us rewards for the cars we so love and want to connect with. 

Besides that the update brings nothing else that is of interest to me, game still runs and looks bad. The Multiplayer keeps needing a ""Schedule"" update and kicks you out of MP until you restart the game.

After roughly 40 Hours of experience with the Multiplayer.. its odd, Even with pretty high ratings (S safety rank, above 4.700 skill rating) People are still clueless most of the time. Oblivious to leaving any kind of space when fighting and braking a decade before they really need. Also where have the Anti Griefing features of FH5 gone? A dude can come into the first corner at mach 10 and wipe out everyone in front of him.. The track cutting Detection is weird too, Sometimes you cut a corner where you 100% sure you messed up and it says nothing and then you drop 0.000001mm off of the outside line and it gives you a second penalty lol.

Graphics and materials had absolute no change to them yet.

They addressed my biggest issue (the progression) and made some solid AI changes. I have fun with the game, and think others will too. However, they still need to add some basic QOL features for those of us who don't want to play online (custom race weekends, custom championships) for this gamed to have real long term replayability. It's not perfect, but the first update has shown that they are listening to feedback, which is great. It's a fun game, but likely not worth the $100 I paid for it.

Original review below:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They were so close to greatness. I can only think that some of the game design decisions were made by people who either don't play racing games or don't enjoy racing as a sport.

First, the driving is great. The physics feel good with a controller, and getting in a good lap is rewarding. The sector-by-sector feedback helps reinforce this feeling, and having played a lot of sim racers, this is the most fun you can have without a wheel. Second, after fiddling with the display settings I was able to settle into ~80 FPS that looks really good. Sometimes there are FPS drops and stutters but I can gloss over that for how pretty the game is for the most part. That being said, you could sear a steak on my 4090, so not exactly ideal.

I could do without the vice-grip hand holding of an intro. If a game takes more than 2 hours to fully reveal it's nature to you, Steam should revise its refund policy. The intro races cannot be skipped and hide the sneaking reality of the game, which is...

Others have talked about the Car Points progression system a lot, so I won't spend a ton of time on that. I don't totally mind it as an idea and could probably live with it. [strike] But an aspect of it that I don't see brought up as often (maybe because it takes time to realize it), is that by the time you have finished a ""Builder's Cup Tour"", you [i] will not [/i] have enough Car Points to use even [i] most[/i] of the upgrades you have unlocked for the car. And then you're done with it. There's no incentive to go back to that car that you've sort of progressed with, unless you really like it. Which leads to what is actually my biggest complaint... [/strike] 

EDIT: First update addressed the above, mostly.

[b] There's no other progression to be had [/b]. Once you finish the Builder's Cup Tours, you're done outside of free play or multiplayer. Even the ""Featured"" tours are inexplicably rolled out over a series of weeks. It only takes a few hours to complete one of these tours; why can't I access the next one immediately after? Sure, you can level up your driver and win credits, but what's the point? To buy new cars? What for?

To that end, why can't I create a custom championship? This is a feature present in every racing sim and simcade since...forever. Baffling exclusion.

Even more baffling: why can't I run a single ""race weekend"" format with practice(s), qualifying, and then a race? You know, like every single racing series in the world.

Oh yeah, let's not rush past that exclusion either. [i] There are no single player qualifying sessions. [/i] In the Builder's Cup Tours, you literally get to choose where you want to start on the grid. In Free Play, you can either choose ""Random"" or sorted by Performance Index. In private multiplayer you can choose the grid based on the fastest lap...of the previous race.

[strike] And then, despite the driving being fun, there are clearly AI behaviors in place that do not follow the same rules as the player. In each Tour I completed, at least once I found myself in the following scenario: 

1. Set the fastest lap in practice.
2. Choose to start in 12th to get the ""Podium Bonus"" or whatever.
3. Pass everyone on the first lap except an AI or two.
4. Over the rest of the race, that AI manages to keep the exact same gap in front of me no matter how quickly I go.

It's the opposite of rubber banding. It's wooden doweling. It's infuriating. Beat your best lap by over a second? So does the AI in front of you. Go off the track and lose a second? By the end of the lap, the gap is still the same. What's the point? [/strike]

EDIT: The above seems to have been fixed in the first update as well. I actually had to turn up the difficulty, which is nice.

Then there are choices are so half-baked that Paul Hollywood is sticking his finger in them. Why are there 4 car bays when you can only see one of them in the menu? Why, after leaving a race, does it take 5 button presses just to get back to upgrading the car [i] I was just driving? [/i]

[b] Why is there nothing to do? [/b]

I don't understand why the game is like this. It's not like there are even microtransactions these decisions are forcing you into. You can't buy Car Points or credits. It's like they don't want you to play what is actually a really fun simcade racer. It didn't have to be this way.",1697058326,1697575066,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Boy, was I wrong. Maybe it was from the ground-up, but they left most of the ""improvements"" in FM7 or on the cutting-room floor.

I watched most of the pre-release [marketing] videos about the product - Incredible car detail, improved physics, new career mode etc. I'm not a car racing game expert - I don't play serious sims like Assetto Corsa or iRacing - however I have played quite a few others like Project Cars 2, prior Forza's and the GTs. 
All of those games look far superior. All of those games have better physics that this. Even Project Cars 3 (which was an arcade game) has better wheel physics than this out of the box. On that, I had to spend hours configuring the wheel to even get something remotely playable. Default settings are not it. (This vid helped a lot to at least make it feel a little more like a car - https://youtu.be/D-vGQZ2_1fs?si=fIM7lt27I9aSp2X0).

As far as I'm concerned, what the devs promised for Day 1 of this release and what we got are not comparable. At all. Not even close. I would call it ""false advertising"" but frankly, like many other AAA games, I really feel it's actually approaching borderline criminal. Considering Steam likely won't give me a refund without me having to complain to my own consumer affairs Government departments would put my Steam account in jeopardy too. So I'm likely stuck with this rubbish. Considering the cost of the game, to me it's also a blatant cash grab.

Btw, I haven't played it yet but the first patch hasn't fixed much and a lot of people have worse performance now (it wasn't really great to begin with).

Issues:

Physics.
Look of cars (some look like they came from Forza 10yrs ago).
Tracks/Terrain can look bad in parts.
General performance. Random stutters.

Served as a means to bond with my old-man who is very much into cars, racing, is an engineer / mechanic etc, he's a big ol' petrolhead and has been since he was a kid.

Forza Motorsport 2023 was, for me, a means to return to gaming with the old-man over something we both very much enjoy, and it honestly ticks me off as to just how poorly MS seems to treat their flagship franchises.

This is under-cooked and it under-delivers on various fronts, from graphical fidelity to performance, the car progression mechanics that are good in the theory but lacks in execution, to the cups / events feeling like you're taking your kids to a track day experience instead of full on racing.

The game just lacks a ""soul"" if that makes sense, it feels like, once again, a ""platform"" to build upon, rather than a product you should pay £60 - 90 for right now. Tracks will be added over time, as I imagine the events and cups will be too, but man it sucks to put money towards something that feels like it could have spent another year or two in the oven.

Performance for me doesn't match up with how the game looks, which, outside of wet weather days, isn't all that impressive. Some car models straight up look worse than their FM5 counterparts, with a lack of detail and polish in comparison to the older models. The game also has a smudgy, blur-like look to it, as if the TAA has been amped up a bunch, not as noticeable on your own car during races, but definitely on your chosen car in the menus and other cars when racing, with motion blur off.

Man, it honestly sucks to give this a no recommendation, I'd love for nothing more than to say yes to this, but right now it isn't worth it. Do what MS likely wants you to do, and is probably why a bunch of their major first-party titles are weak on launch these days, sub to Game Pass and try it out instead, see for yourself.

   Game runs poorly, isn't optimized at all. The engine is indeed *not built from the ground up and is infact; the same engine as previous titles. It chugs horrendously. My guess is because they've crammed it full of buggy UI that completely erases options, key-binds and other settings. You will have to sit and wait for it to compile shaders every-single-time you launch the game ( takes about 2-5 minutes no biggie ). If that isn't the cause, perhaps its the fact that the engine they're using is 15 years old or so. After all, I'm not a game developer so I have no idea what it would cost or take to actually start from the ground up. Right? Cope harder Turn 10.

   Forza Motorsport 2023 is purposely designed to be grindy. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of progression. However, the reason It is so grindy isn't because of progression. You may be surprised to hear that Turn 10 has done something kinda scummy.. Shocker right? There are a handful of events to complete in Forza Motorsport 2023, all of which could be completed in around 16-20 hours for *most people. You have to do every single race twice and it forces you to load separate screens for everything. A 15 minute race is now looking closer to about a half-hour or 45 minutes. 
             I know what you're thinking; ""well 16-20 hours doesn't sound like a lot of time considering I spent over 300 in Forza 7 and really enjoyed it."" Well, here's the thing. For 70 dollars I could put some fuel in my car and buy a fifth of fireball. I can then drive my car into a lake and drown myself. Not only will that be a LOT more fun, but it will be visually satisfying while hammered. 

    The point i'm trying to make is that they've taken under 20 hours of actual gameplay and extended it to upwards of 60 or more for a lot of people. 20 hours of content is NOT a lot for 70 dollars! They've extended that by over 40 hours! THAT'S LIKE 40 HOURS OF CUT-SCENES, LOADING SCREENS AND DISAPPOINTMENT Y'ALL! ( also having to do 3 practice laps is like doing the whole thing twice ). Don't even get me started on the micro-transactions folks.. SPOILER they're all broken! No one is surprised after FH4 though. Wait, how is this legal?

    The Unskippable tutorial is designed to SUCK time away from you in hopes to get you past the 2 hour mark ( steam refund policy ).... my god is it scummy. Luckily for me I am extremely impatient and I skip everything to get to the good stuff ( the driving). Which as it turns out is somehow worse than previous games. However, There are some good things about this game. I like the return to a more realistic driving game. Its just too little, too late. Thats also practically the only thing they did other than remove half the good cars. Not an upgrade.

AAA studios backed by (in most cases) billions of dollars cannot manage to release a single game worth a fraction of the price they sell it as. There is a reason for this and it's actually kinda funny if you choose to look at it the way I do. 

If a AAA studio can do the bare-minimum to release a product at the same price point as a *feature complete game* - that's what they're going to do. They'll continue to get away with this as long as you ( the consumer ) continue to shovel money like a mindless zombie directly to the pockets of their greedy investors and company owners. They release dog sh*t, you eat it. Simple as!  It's your job as a consumer to look at such a product and do some critical thinking ""Do I /eat/ the dog poo? Perhaps I move on with my life and play cookie clicker instead. I dunno, I'm kinda hungry"". At least, that's what I think when I'm looking at a TRIPLE A RELEASE.

Forza Horizon not only plays better, but it looks better too. All while running smoothly on my 4K panel WITH RT on. 
How is this not at an early access price point with the little badge on the steam page?? It's baffling. P.s, that game sucks too. Imagine being British and then misrepresenting an entire culture in a f**king racing game. B R U H.

I feel no satisfaction as I was genuinely looking forward to a new ""realistic"" racing game. Unfortunately, for someone looking at something more mainstream you may need to look into the purchase of a Playstation. It's obvious That Xbox does not care about their developers, consumers or public Image. They're buying up absolutely everything they can so they can continue to do exactly this. Sony is still a bad company, but they're somehow less bad than Microsoft. Opt for real car perhamps? 

If you're unable to finish the tutorial and opening race within the 2 hour limit, you will be stuck with this waste of storage space until the ends of time. Choose wisely. Don't believe me? Hold onto it for about 5 years when the devs finally make something playable out of it for the 50 or so people that still use the product. I bet they'll all be dev play testers too :D

2440510,148369821,76561198002466305,0,98,112,0,112,1697256338,"The game really wants you to feel invested in owning and driving a single car or small selection of cars, which is reinforced via its progression system. The career mode, as flexible as its many difficulty options are, actively works against this design by requiring you to invest in new cars to play new events. Your sense of progress is constantly reset. I acknowledge that gating tuning options does make the game feel less overwhelming for beginner players, but as someone moderately experienced with sim-cade racers, and generally already familiar with what to tweak to get what I want out of a car, not having the options available in the order I'd like makes most cars not particularly engaging out of the box. 

In concept, I think the idea of having practice laps prior to the actual race event is cool. In the very early stages of the career where this also determines your starting position, it feels like there's some actual impact to your performance here too, which adds some satisfaction to it beyond what you may get by seeing your time improve from lap to lap. Unfortunately for the game, one of its myriad of adjustable difficulty settings that you unlock a couple of races into the career throws the entire concept into the toilet and just has you choosing your starting position, allowing you to wager credits on your ability to gain an ever increasing bonus based on how far back from first you choose. The value of credits is diminished too, as car upgrades are paid for entirely in a separate point system tied to their level. Credits just earns you new cars, the purchase of which reduce your ability to feel attached to any one vehicle. Ultimately, the practice laps end up feeling like a chore when you're tasked with running 3 laps in practice mode prior to an event that typically has 4 laps as its baseline. If they wanted to retain the practice laps aspect, the grid position aspect needs to disappear, and something more needs to be done to make me feel like credits are worth caring about. I think earlier stages of the career mode would benefit from balancing practice lap / event lap counts based on expected length of play for the cars you're able to afford. As it stands, if I just want to play for an hour, maybe too, it feels like I can't do much more than two event races when factoring in their practice laps and the event laps, plus loading times, etc. Save the larger time commitments for later in the career where you're expected to have faster cars, and give the option to omit practice laps without requiring you to load in to them and skip them manually every time would be a good start.

The physics feel like a step up from Horizons, but the meta aspects of the game outside of the racing itself aren't particularly satisfying and are often contradictory, much to the detriment of the game. It feels pretty difficult to recommend when it seems so evident that it'd benefit from another 6 months to a year of refinement, when many other games are out there and fun to play right now. At best, I'd caution you to consider trying it on gamepass, or if you have an Xbox, borrow it from someone you know before buying it.

The physics feel really good for my taste, a lot of understeer when I'm racing in a AWD or FWD car but when I get thrown into a more powerful and light RWD car its not hard to spin the tires and lose control. It's definitely a step up from the physics in FH5 imo.
The graphics and the variable weather that was the major selling point of the game are pretty good even though my computer can't quite run the game on ultra smoothly. I'm happy with how the game looks in 60fps on high settings though after I messed with it a bit. The weather is really fun too, I haven't done any longer races but even on some races with 5 or 6 laps sometimes it transitions from overcast to rain and you can feel the change in grip and see your lap times go down, the variable weather is a very fun feature.
I realize this might be a hot take but I do like the progression system even if it feels a bit slow at times. For the career races at least it is fun to take a stock car out on the track, get completely stomped by the AI, then level the car up a bit, get suspension tuning unlocked and turn right around and consistently get podium finishes. It adds another layer to the game and makes the game feel more challenging at times which is a welcome change from FH5 where I simply could beat the hardest AI easily by tuning my car up for about 5 minutes before going into a race.
I don't think the game is perfect though. It feels like it lacks content a bit and after I play it for a while longer it might get repetitive but with a busy college schedule it hasn't gotten there yet. There isn't a huge selection of tracks and no Nordschleife is quite sad.

I love the progression, others hate it. Nothing else seems like it would be a dealbreaker for anyone. 

There are definitely areas where things could improve, but at its core this is an awesome platform for racing. 

Pros: 
-Physics feel great.
-Wheel FFB is spot on once dialed in
-Cars all have personality.
-Although not perfect, car progression does help with building an attachment to your cars.
-Online racing feels impactful. By the time you have purchased, leveled, tuned, done a practice, and qualified, you feel invested in the race.
-Tire strategies really add to the race craft.
-AI is way more engaging that the gran turismo AI (AI will also be found in the cons though)
-Net code seems pretty solid for online racing
-Safety rating in multiplayer (currently glitched and not working, but it is still noticeable that more people are trying for clean races)

Cons:

-H pattern shifting with a clutch is useless. 
-AI is insane. Although more engaging than Gran Turismo’s AI, the Forza AI is hyper aggressive. They will block you, side swipe you as you pass on a strait, and ram you through turn 1.
-Seems pretty tough to run compared to Horizon, but I can’t really say it looks better. I haven’t had crashes, but I’m also only getting 80fps and the graphics don’t justify it.
-I would have appreciated more unlock cars. You essentially need to get through 5 separate series, with 5 races in each at 20 or so mins a race for a single car unlock. If my math is correct that is over 8 hours to unlock a car.
- progression system could use some polish. Although I like leveling cars, the game doesn’t do a good job incentivizing driving the un modified cars. Time trials for factory cars or spec events for factory cars would go a long way.

THE BAD STUFF!
Out the box issues:
5-20 minutes ""optimising shaders"" every time I launch it despite making ZERO changes to the settings.
FFB is utterly comical and you need to spend HOURS just to get some feeling out of it.
ABS, TC and stability have just 3 settings on, sport and off. 
When using on and sport these fight all your inputs causing the cars to weave like they're drunk or on Acid and following an imaginary track. 
TC off causes uncontrollable and unrecoverable spins if the AI touch you (last game I encountered this in was Dirt 3 using a controller back in 2012-2013).

Graphics:
GFX artifacts all over the place. some on the car windscreens and right in your damned face. 
Barriers switching from white to black to white again right at the point the LOD pops in. 
Trees changing colour as you approach them (caused by the ludicrously short shadows and LOD popping in). 
Car tyres leave trails behind them like black pixie dust, no it's not skidmarks either...
A permanent ghostly halo around your drivatar when viewing the grid. (are my eyes getting bad or summat?)
Permanently blurred visuals for ANYTHING more than 20 feet in front of your car, that leaves you feeling like someone's smeared vaseline on your screen or your eyes need testing and flat out causes headaches after 30-40 minutes. (Ahh good my eyes are just fine then TFFT!).
ABYSMAL fps rates even on a £1000+ GPU. 50-60fps on a 7900XTX at max settings yet STILL blurred to HELL and this just gets WORSE if you reduce settings to get acceptable fps rates.
Locked fps in multiplayer to half your screen refresh rate because it's ""unfair"" to console owners.
FPS locked to 60 fps in Rivals. REGARDLESS for the same reason. because the default settings on console gives just 30fps at 4K.
Oh and replays? Locked to 16:9 aspect ratio even on a 32:9 display and no way to save them (thank GOD for that at least!)

Controls:
Massively limited in car control options, no TC, ABS or brake balance adjustments etc even in cars that HAVE this irl.
No way to assign these even if they WERE in the game.
Tyres that might as well be shopping trolley wheels giving naff all confidence the car is gonna go where you point it.

""Advanced AI"" ROFLMAO!
The ""Advanced AI"" is a complete JOKE battering you off track for no reason. 
Rear ending you like you don't exist. 
Braking on main straights for NO REASON. 
Sliding off track at random, again for no apparent reason (I guess even the AI thinks the handling is PANTS).
That completely gives up once you DO get ahead.
Can't replicate their own practice times in races.
Sure as HELL can't race given I ended up 2 MINUTES ahead with max AI and started from the back of the grid and ended up in 1st after T2 on the 2nd damned lap, Closest AI was over 30 seconds behind me.

Other peeves...
No qualifying in races other than online.
Random starting positions in races outside the career mode. you have NO option to chose (it took me 30 attempts and over 2 HOURS to get close to the back of the grid for a last to 1st challenge to compare the AI to AMS2 because of the DISASTROUS AI and this random grid BS).
Can't make it up Eau Rouge flat out even on soft tyres which burn out after just 8 laps even in a damned RACE CAR!
AI 18 seconds off my tail after just 5 laps! 3rd place was 43 seconds off and last AI was lapped whilst going off track ate EVERY freaking corner.
See for yourself (set to 4K)
https://youtu.be/3NlpCnDgIMk?si=L-8KO4tFjniZlcmw

AMS2 AI @100% and max aggression same car and track:

In short this isn't a racing game, it's a bumper cars simulator for the short sighted filled with blind hopeless AI with all the race craft of Mr Bean on acid.

The good:
NEVER buying a T10 or PGG game as BOTH their last entries are UTTER pants so at least I'll be saving some cash I guess, Oohh how the mighty have fallen.

Hopefully that is only temporary as most of these issues could possibly get patched by for now the career is pretty much unplayable. Get yourself a code for 7 and play that for now.

Firstly, there is a lot less car classes than in 7. That means there is less variety which is very disappointing.

Then there is a staggering lack of customization for career events. You cannot even change the number of laps for the career which is always locked to 4 and you are forced to do 3 mandatory practice laps. That is tied to the completely moronic progression system but that is still so stupid that they should change this immediately.

The worst offender for me and what makes this game unplayable in my mind is the fact that you are forced, I repeat FORCED, to pick your grid position. What serious sim arcade game does not include a qualification system? You already force us to practice laps just use those times to determine the grid. I sincerely do not understand who approved this game design feature.

Finally there is just no sense of progression or endgame. Motorsport 7 had a fantastic career that was one of the best in this space of sim arcade racers but here there is just nothing here.

This is so disappointing as visuals look great and physics of driving are ok (not great) but for me it all crushes against the awful career mode.

If you're racing with a wheel it is MANDATORY to change the wheel settings if you want to enjoy that experience.

I've also encountered many bugs and glitches like the entire track disappearing mid-race, or the game crashing to desktop for no reason. Also the driver view is REALLY hit and miss based on the car you're driving for mirrors. I can't even see the right side mirror to know if anyone is even coming up next to me, and the proximity arrows are mediocre at best for knowing where people are when inside the car. 

Despite all the problems I have with the game, it still does inch, just barely, over to still recommending it because it is such a fun game, and the online racing is superb and some of the most intense racing I've ever experienced.

They also need to fix the penalty system. I keep getting penalized for someone else punting me off. My safety rating drops to A for other people being sloppy. 

Currently I'm S - 4850 and will continue playing since it's enjoyable but I'm looking forward to some patches. I haven't tried the game with a controller yet.",1697477614,1697483461,True,7,2,0.508407652378082275,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for a good racing sim, you won't find it here. If you want a decent arcade racer, then ok, maybe. Driving physics are about the same as in  previous releases, only now weather can change during a race. Not much, but there it is. Rain on the windshield and side windows still looks wrong, but not as bad as it could. Rainy weather doesn't affect the driving a whole lot though, at least I haven't noticed much difference between wet and dry surface handling. There are lots of cars to choose from, even some Chinese ones, surprisingly. But only one Alfa Romeo, and it's a small crappy one at that, one of the modern ones. I just got the game recently, so maybe there are more than just that one available in the Buy Cars section of the main menu, but it would've been nice if they included some classics like Giulietta or a GTV6. And no Fiat that I saw. I heard complaints about the car leveling system, but personally, it doesn't bother me. All in all, if you're a fan of the series, then give it a shot, I think it's at least no worse than the previous one. If you're new to Forza Motorsport, than try it at your own risk. As I said in the beginning, it's not a racing sim, it's an arcade at most. And if you are going to try it, please, for all that is holy, don't get any of the more expensive versions, at least until you are sure that you like the game and want to keep playing.

P.S. I forgot to mention a very important thing. This game will require you to sign in to a Microsoft account. At least it made me do so, and even though it showed an option for free play offline, it would not let me proceed until I signed in. Also, I have that a lot of people have reported that they were unable to sign in for extended periods of time and, therefore, unable to play. This hasn't happened to me yet, but I played for less than 40 hrs as of the posting of this review.

P.P.S.  Rather limited choice of tracks to race on. Previous version had more. Quite unpleasant surprise was missing Nurburgring Nordschleife. All that's available is Nurburgring short and GP variants, but the full 20 km course is not there.",1697393563,1697480167,False,0,0,0.499438822269439697,0,True,False,False

The handling feel is solid, and it the multiplayer (if it works(it doesn't)) is a great experience. As well as the race gearbox actually simulating a proper sequential racing gearbox, allowing for clutchless shifting even on manual w/ clutch (apart into 1st and reverse) which is a nice thing.

However that's about all the good things there are.

The AI is garbage. Sure, it doesn't cheat like the recent Horizon 4 and 5 titles, however it is completely incompetent at anything other than setting fast times. It has zero racecraft. It will not try to overtake you if you manage to get ahead, or even the backmarkers if you make a race long enough, its launches are awful, it sometimes acts like you're not there and just torpedos into the back of your car. Heck, if you park it on the racing line, it will confuse it enough to have it either plow into you, or just stop and act confused.

The graphics... it looks great. Sometimes. Sometimes the colours get washed out, the paint jobs are dull and you have to jump through hoops (two-tone decals of the exact same colour) to get a more vibrant tone. The only good things it's done is that the livery finder finally defaults to ""current car"", and that the preview image is large enough to have an idea of what it looks like. Too bad the preview image is awful quality, and you still can't actually look around the car with it before selecting it.
It does not look much better than Horizon 5 even when it looks good, but runs much worse nonetheless.

The multiplayer... well, the early-release between 5th and 10th was fantastic. I had a lot of good fun despite the game crashing to desktop on one occasion. Which as it turns out, was a sign of things to come. Since the full release, the game has crashed to desktop during every single pre-race intermission I've reached. I hear that the matchmaking system is broken and doesn't correctly pair based off of the skill and safety ratings the way it should, but I can't confirm for myself.

Edit: There's also no stats.

The car leveling system is an interesting concept ruined. Firstly, it's specific to that single car. If you buy another copy of the same car, level-up it again. It should have been applied to an entire division (e.g. Forza GT), really. In addition, the first things anyone would adjust - tyres and brakes - come in way too late. The entire selection of tuning parts - differential, tyres, brakes, sway bars and suspension - should come in first thing, since the default settings are god-awful on some cars. The hyped-up Builders' Cup is pretty much over once you get any degree of tunability anyway. And it's missing some Horizon-included things like track width improvements to fix the fitment.

Overall rating: 4.5/10. It has so much potential, but the execution so far has been awful.",1697478073,1697478626,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I would wait for a sale and give them time to fix the game breaking bugs first. Also don't expect anything new or exciting here just the same old with better graphics and physics. 

most game play issues are small like damage it would be nice if it was actually realistic instead of i drive into a wall at 200 and i just crumpled the hood and damaged my shocks and engine slightly. also the penalty system makes no sense i slightly bump into someone and there's a small chance i get a penalty, i drive someone of the road or collide with then head on driving the wrong way down the track and that's fine not issue there. also how does a air filter improve stability, if you want to make a realistic racing game at least try.

 my main issues is the game breaking bugs that happen to often to be acceptable for any game yet alone from a large developer. one in four times when i finish a race and upgrade my car the game gets stuck loading the changes. then you must restart the game and restart the race again and sometimes even the one before. and I don't like games where you have to be connected to play single player why just why. 

The game also feels like a freemium game for some reason yes you have a descant amount of cars and tracks but for the price i feel like you should get more and they already are selling new cars. hopefully they give people some new content as time goes on instead of making you pay for every thing. i guess time will tell, but I would not be optimistic. I will change my review to positive if they fix the game and apologise for releasing a full price game in this state and give people some free content as compensation. great potential for this game if they don't screw it up.",1697476675,1697476675,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Builders cups are great but there aren't enough of them to make up a substantial enough single player experience. 

Leveling up cars is too slow. It's way too much of a grind. It needs to be like half of the time that it currently is. 

The AI is horrendous. They drive directly into you mid corner. If you drive directly alongside one in a straight line, sometimes they will randomly just bump into you and won't correct their line so you're just permanently stuck onto them until you drive off the road. 

The penalty system is terrible. The game definitely needs a penalty system but this implementation is so inconsistent. People who ram you never get penalized but you will definitely get a penalty for something minor or something that wasn't your fault.

On the positive side: Screens load quickly. A controller works very well with it. The practices and races are intense. There's ample skill levels to satisfy every player.

On the negative side:
I had to spend a full day learning about the settings and running benchmarks to get it working smoothly.

Every 2nd or 3rd race in career (all I've played so far) it gets stuck on applying upgrades. When this happens, the previous race hasn't been saved and must be raced again. It does save progress to driver and cars stats so more upgrades can be applied. There is a work around, by continuing to the next race without upgrades, exit, and start again and apply upgrades.

When trying to save replays, it says no files found.

It stutters badly at times, occasionally even stopping for a few seconds. Any adjustments made during the stuttering result in over steering or braking too hard. (After watching many videos and countless benchmarks, I've eliminated stuttering by turning off Raytracing, using 1080 resolution, resolution scale to 100, using 60FPS (V-Sync), and disabling hyper threading - so only 6 primary cores on my i5 13600KF.)

I've also turned many settings way down to consistently get 60 FPS. 

Hopefully updates are coming quickly to resolve these problems and much better optimisation. Once I eliminated stuttering and got past upgrade problems, I've thoroughly enjoyed the game. But it's a shame that it takes such high end components to play with decent graphics.

I guess I'll just lower the settings

Oh well, I'll just deal with it for the intro race, this should be done soon.
/3 or so races later/
(At this point I've been incoherently rambling about how they wont shut up and just let me race for a good duration, to the point that I even came up with a conspiracy about how you can never skip the Female Voices, but can always skip the Male voices)

There we go, a benchmark, lets see whats causing me to lag!

Does anyone nowadays know how to work and put out a, at bare minimum working product.  This is just shit work ethic and terrible ethics in general.  How does the customization feel so bland and clunky. The screen where you can change your wheels is by far the worst ever. You can see like one rim on the car and graphically its hard to tell what looks good because the graphics in that menu are soooo terrible.  Feels like there is one track in the game when you first start off with an occasional track that looks different.  Beyond the weather and looks of a like two tracks the graphics feel extremely bland.  Highly disappointed start to this game for me.

Multiplayer is a bit sketchy in terms of bugs.  Especially on transitions between modes - practice/qualifying/race - can randomly hang, either unrecoverably, costing you a couple of minutes of your timed session, or possibly costing you the ability to change your tires and fuel after qualifying.  I've found that trying to change your tuning setup less than a minute before the practice session ends is a fairly reliable way to have it crap out entirely.  

There's also a lot of smaller niggles that are indicative of a lack of polish.  As an example: the pits generally look like a complete mess, with everyone's cars overlaying each other - would it have been that hard to assign everyone a separate pit bay?  It doesn't affect how it plays, but they either didn't have time or didn't care.  If you wanna open a bug or report a player, you don't do it via the game - it gives you a QR code to scan, which is definitely easier to implement but feels like lazy programming.

The racing itself honestly feels pretty good when everything's working - but with the number of bugs I'm running across I can't recommend it until some fixes get done.",1697062708,1697414468,False,3,0,0.534883737564086914,0,True,False,False

As for the penalty system, Idk what other people are talking about but it seems pretty fair to me. I only get penalties when it actually feels like I should've and even then, it's pretty generous. I could ram my car into the back of another and vice versa and still not get a penalty. I've also seen some complaints about people saying the progression system is bad because they're just trying to get you to play the game more. Yeah, no shit. I spent $70 on this game, I'd hope it entices me to play it more by rewarding me for it. And it's not like it feels tedious or like I'm feeling forced to play more.

-driving Ai: dude if u want to start a race in career make sure ur car is lv 50, even that is not enough the AI rubber bands and wrecks u at any lv. even if they have the same tune and hardware they have rockets attached to them.
-Car progression: who ever came up with this idea should be fired , after 200+ hrs and i still haven't max out even half of the cars. all you get in return for you hard work  is burnout.

Missing cars that have been in the series forever, surely to be added later for more money.

Missing tracks that have been in the series forever (no Nordschleife, really turn 10?) surely to also be added later for more money.

Driving with a wheel and using manual with a clutch is scuffed. IDK how they thought taking that long to shift a car was anywhere close to deserving to be in a game with ""Motorsports"" in the title.

Graphics issues and terrible FPS even for people with high end PCs.

The list goes on. I'm sure a lot of this stuff will be patched, but this game groups Turn 10 with all the other lazy AAA developers like EA and Ubisoft.

But I can't give it a good review until they fix the damn performance issues. The game SHOULD NOT STRUGGLE TO RUN AT 60 FPS on a 1080p monitor, on a RTX 3080 and an i7 10700. It is atrocious! And no matter if the game runs on Ultra or Low, there are constant frame dips with low resource use!

When playing the career mode and upgrading your car after finishing a race, it WILL ""freeze"" when trying to apply the upgrades. Or sometimes when saving. This happens sometimes after one race, sometimes after two and so on. There's no other way for you to work around it than hard quitting the game from task manager and then starting it up again. But wait there's more: you have to race the same race again after rebooting since it won't save your previous progress on the race itself. However, your credits and XP is saved but the race progress isn't. Not a great feeling to race the same circuits multiple times and not progressing at all. 10/10 would not enjoy. This has happened to me too many times to count.

However, I think I understand the thought process behind it as real life racing youre not really getting and building new cars on the daily, so maybe in terms of simulation....I guess, but that's still a stretch. With that in mind, I have had fun in every race so far and I am enjoying the game a lot. Wouldnt say its the most innovative and groundbreaking release of a Forza game but it is Forza's brand of racing and I like it.

Well, I guess I am the top percentile here.  The elusive 13900k + 4090. I had a little jittering issue but that seemed to be my fault for misconfiguring the nvidia control panel. Granted I only played 10 hours during the early access, but I have not had the issues others have seem to have had. I have played through a couple of the career series and the first part of the monthly one.

I think the graphical fidelity is generally good enough but could be better and at some points it looks amazing. Car leveling does suck. [strike]But I think 3+ hours is a stretch to get a car to level 20. I think I got to level 19 in the first career builders cup. I did a few extra laps on practice and I think I didn't podium in one of them so I ran it again. I have multiple cars in the high teens...again only 10 hours. Not saying I like it at all but in my opinion its not THAT bad.[/strike] As for career length and such I can't really speak to that. I've been seeing some bad things and as I don't really multi that much I can only hope its not true.

Otherwise I concur with everyone else. The actual racing is very intense and engaging. Weight transfer is really prominent here I haven't noticed that in other entries horizon or motorsports. I think its good so far. There are a couple additions to tuning that I think has made it easier for me personally to get the car to handle how I want which I like.

Onto the game 
I've hated the permanent static shadow below the cars ever since I saw them in previews. The dynamic shadows will overlap this prehistoric graphical eye sore of a shadowing technique in daylight and in night time, creating a shadow on top of a shadow. When headlights or other light sources point below another car, the static shadow will still be there, even with ray tracing. Not immersive. 

I find the graphics settings very offensive. The settings are few in between and I experience mildly annoying artifacting in motion, like there's a permanent FSR or incompatible AA turned on and hidden from my settings. I suspect it's the dynamic setting, which you can't turn off, that's messing with my visuals. 

The good thing I can say is that the car physics in Forza has never felt more detailed than it does in this one (but it could always be better; more realistic). With a later model Xbox One controller, the cars' vibrations is very well translated to the controller's rumble trigger feedback. If controller is your primary way of playing Forza games, it could be the way to take your vehicle control discipline to the next level, assuming you turn off all assist.

Turn10 took all our complaints and grievances from Forza7 and Horizon# and doubled down on them. The agonizing tutorial I can only described as 'Mansplaining'. You are forced to use the car that they give you (or one of three choices). I finally completed the ""Builders cup"" with a bloated yellow mustang that i didn't want, only to find three more ""cups"" with the same limits on creativity and choice. It seems the entirety of career mode is like this. The big sin persists as your forced to race a specific type of car/class. Complete one championship to unlock the next. Want to race a vintage Ferrari,?an old Miata? that's immediately locked. No, i don't want to race a ""hot hatch"". No, i don't want to race in some gangling Audi. I want to choose, I want to putz around in that Miata or a MGA to start. 

[h1]The progression through vehicles absolutely should be the players decision, not forced.[/h1]
All the championships need to be unlocked from the start. 

Now that actual ""Building""? That seems largely unchanged. Unless we count the multiple forms of currency that parts are locked behind. First your car has to be a certain level before your allowed to even peruse specific parts. Then you are allotted a certain amount of CP (yes CP) that can't be exceeded. Each part subtracts from your total CP. You gain more CP by leveling up your car?i think? Its honestly a thoughtful way to add RPG elements to game that is about the furthest thing from an RPG. So no more buying that 240sx and immediately ricing it out to go drifting, you gotta level it up first. Instead of qualifying we get ""practice laps"" which are skippable. Any would-be qualifying is rendered useless because your allowed to pick your own start position in the next race. 
I just cant Turn10, I cant sit through this like i did with you before. Everything that was painful in the Horizon series is here too, and its atrocious. Its over, were through.

I would recommend the game for casual racers playing bumper cars, but its not without issues and is frustrating if you want to actually race.

The clutch on the controller is not the same, you need to upgrade your transmission and clutch to use it effectively, without bogging down. The tire wear system has me guessing. Sometimes you start a practice with wet weather because its storming and one lap in you need to swap for medium because the track is now more or less dry. There is no real instruction on how to develop pit strategy regarding tire wear. you can have soft tires that last maybe 4 laps medium tires that can out last hard tires. The online races are 2-6 laps usually so i'm not sure why they are trying to shoe horn tire wear. I feel like the tire wear can be developed into a more logical system with a purpose rather than how it is. 

The game is severely demanding with frame stutters more noticeable in areas like Hakone along the main straight, which can cause some bumping and accidental corner bombing in other cases, i think this is a net code issue more than anything. The problem really starts when you lose driver rating because someone else ran into you forcing you off track with a 4.50 sec penalty. Therefor the ghosting could be a lot better. maybe in the race with S class safety rating you can have no ghosting and  in the A safety rating you could add more ghosting.

I have yet to figure out a good way to test and tune the cars to each track, was way easier in the last Horizon, for now is frustrating until i figure it out.  all i want to do is run hot laps restart the hot lap. make adjustments in the pits and continue testing. it says i can but i have not found it in the options.

Solo career is kind of a boring grind, but a good time sink. Too bad its necessary to level up your favourite car to unlock more upgrade parts. You can level your car up just by driving in any mode tho. Or worse yet, you just spent an hour levelling a car that is totally inferior to another car of the same class.

Overall i am satisfied with the game, but it could be better. If you are interested give it a try. NOTE you will probably need to spend some time calibrating your settings to give it a fair shot, which will cut down on your 2 hour trial.

Edit*

I think grinding out cars needs to be removed, its been mentioned in other reviews that if I have the money I should just be able to buy the upgrades.

Biggest gripe is the physics at the moment. I don't play singleplayer so I cannot comment on that.

The thing is, changing the graphics settings only makes matters worse. You have to restart the game for your changes to make any difference. Even then, 1 or 2 races later, performance tanks again.

From what I understand, it's partly due to this game relying on single thread performance (I'm running on a Ryzen 5 3600), and also due to some issues with DLSS (RTX 3070).

IF if you have a SIMAGIC wheelbase, you need to invert your steering wheel force feedback.... why this is ever a thing i have no clue. ALSO, you must go into the tune option for every car and go the entire way to the right to the ""steering"" options, turn up force feedback to max. you have to do this with every individual car. This will change the entire way the car handles and your connection to oversteer/understeer. The graphics are meh, but they work. the AI is awful but that will probably get updates. this is by no means a simulator, but once you get the wheel dialed in (after 12 hours of trying) it doesnt feel bad. 

They know how to build up some energy prior to release...
however, this game is not ready for pc in my opinion. You will spend hours trying to set up your wheel base to feel anything that could possibly resemble an accurate driving experience. But at best it only feels like an arcade game in an actual arcade. I am using a simagic alpha mini and cannot find any seetting to give a decent feel. understeer comes through as an aggressive vibrating in the steering wheel or no feel at all. over steer comes through after the car has already lost grip and is mostly a visual sense.
As far a visuals. i dont even have words to describe how poor they are. The graphics and frame rate are absolutely terrible... if you want to use triples will it work yes, will your frame rate be 7 fps, also yes. I have 16gb of ddr4 ram, a rizen 5 5600 cpu, and a RTX 2080 gpu. even dropping to 1, 32"" 1440 widescreen monitor in 1080p resolution, I only got 21 fps with everything on LOW QUALITY. The graphics settings are not refined for pc users. Ive seen people saying they get 60 fps no problem, but they are using an rtx 4090. unless you have a top of the line PC you will most likely struggle with frame rate and visual quality.

I was looking to scratch that 'start off with 5k, buy a beater, race it a bit, build it a bit, have fun with it' itch. I watched an interview with one of the lead devs and this whole 'built not bought' philosophy and it sounded right up my alley. This is NOTHING like I was hoping for.

First off you start in a late model Corvette doing a practice lap, with no opt-out and no way to access the main menu. I was using M/KB at the time just to get into the game and adjust settings for the wheel (G29). Because the wheel was plugged in, the mouse/kb wasn't working as intended. So after a few minutes of frustration I pulled the wheel over (on an A-frame setup) and half-arsed my way through this mandatory practice lap that serves no discernible purpose. 

Immediately thereafter, you're thrown into another mandatory, unskippable, no way to access the main menu race;  the final two laps of an enduro, at night, in a LMP car.. I mean really, this is a nightmare scenario for anyone who's trying to configure their wheel and other settings, has no idea what buttons to push to look left/right/behind/etc.

So now I've finally reached the main menu (and freedom!), or so I thought.... nope. You've got to complete an introductory Builder's Cup that consists of three practice sessions + races, and you're given the choice of three different late model cars (can't remember which, I took the Civic because it seemed the least larry). I've just completed this and I'm 2.5 hours into the game. 

At no point yet have I felt like I was actually doing something that I've CHOSEN to do. The amount of on-rails/dumbed down/curated experience is real here. After the first Builder's Cup race you can 'customize' your car using Car Points, except it choose all the upgrades for me, didn't give me the option to review what had changed, nor did it give me the option to go back so I could at least make an educated guess at what components it was swapping out. Are you serious?

I'd also like to bring attention to the amount of nested/cascading/not-intuitive menus that composed my brief experience (post second Builders Cup race) with the car customization process. You've got to click 5? times just to cycle through the upgrade comparisons, many of which are just useless arbitrary numbers. Please get rid of the whole system and replace the space with a simple stat page. The wheel has been a-round for a long time, UX designers.

While I'm ranting, the game requires a MS/XBox account to play, offline or not. I knew this before hand, but was unaware that the initial handshaking takes half a dozen different apps to be whitelisted through a software firewall. I never used an MS or XBOX account before, and it shows... I had to enable:
Steam (duh)
Forza_steamworks_release_final.exe (no surprise)
msedgewebview2.exe (xbox login i guess?)
microsoft.windows.cloudexperiencehost (xbox login stuff?)
gamingservices.exe (yet more xbox related stuff) 

The wheel experience is pretty awful out of the box, limited experience but just my first impressions. The Wheel Settings page is even worse though. Speaking of settings pages, why is the Accessibility Tab second on the menu, just so you have to scroll past it EVERY SINGLE TIME? Or the Language Tab for that matter.. these are options that you One-and-Done, no need to clutter up the menu with them, put them in an Options sub menu.

Special mention to the Graphics Settings that reset the gamma whenever you Apply Settings. Combine this with a bug that randomly chooses DLSS or FSR whenever you initialize the game, and you've got a nice catch-22 where you don't know if your upscaling is functioning properly and you can't re-apply it to make sure because it will blow-out your gamma and you're back to square one. Title was shipped in this state making them grossly incompetent or, more likely, simply didn't care enough. Doesn't bode well for the future of FM8.

Anyways, my goal was to a play a fun simcade with access to some older (and slower) cars that I could hotlap (around the 'ring eventually) and occasionally do races with to make $$$, tinker around with them, and generally feel like I was making progression. These hopes were immediately dashed when I perused the Career mode and found the category I'm looking for (Vintage Hatch) is locked behind countless hours of other high-end content.. that itself will require countless hours of grinding in cars I have no interest in. 

I guess this brings me full circle to my initial statement, if you're looking for something like an early Gran Turismo (but on a PC), in it's current state, this should be avoided. I feel like one of the devs has a kung-fu grip on my wrist and is pulling me along regardless of whether or not I'm enjoying myself.

Poor PC port with poor CPU scaling. This game was supposedly made from the ground up yet the multi-threading is on par with an early DX11 game. So much for this being a supposed current gen game. This makes ray tracing unviable on most DDR4-based platfroms like AM4 or Intel 11th gen or earlier. The overall single thread performance is simply not high enough on most of these slightly older processors. For example even with ray tracing my older i9-10900F couldn't keep up with my RTX3070. At least VRAM wasn't an issue for the testing I did. At least not at 1080p. That's the only silver lining I found. 

If the game was less demanding and ran faster then I'd be more forgiving. Unfortunately that's not the case. As it stands I can't recommend this PC port. Alas the underlying technology is shoddy. Maybe the Xbox version can provide a better experience. If you're stuck with the PC version you can only cope and wait for new drivers to maybe claw back some performance.

There are lots of bugs including:
- Have to force close game after every Multiplayer race because it won't load new lobbies
- Awful screen lag & screen judder
- Game randomly freezes in multiplayer
- Low FPS (I meet the recommended system specs and playing on medium graphics quality)
- Maps and tracks don't render so you effectively race on an invisible track (the most noticeable is at Hakone)
- Multiplayer penalties applied to the victim of an incident not the person causing it
- In car displays not aligned in the correct place
- Genuinely awful and confusing user interface 
- No ability to map keys to your chosen controller (imagine thinking the accept/ok button should be mapped to the same function that changes the camera to rear view!?)
- Game freezes on load screens in menus so you have to force quit and start again

As well as that, it doesn't look like any effort has been made to improve the game:
- Car models are not finished and look worse than previous motorsport titles
- Car list is rehashed from Motorsport 7
- Graphics noticeably worse than previous motorsport titles
- Progression system for cars is pointless and time consuming - what does this achieve other than endless grinding?
- You have to grind for 'Car Points' for Upgrades, making the credits you win in races next to useless
- Limited truly new vehicles or modern updated versions from previous titles (2013 AMG A45 not 2019??) WHY?
- Flawed progression system in single player, which is extremely tedious and I stopped playing after 4 races - so boring
- Cars don't sound realistic or anything like they would in real life - upgrades don't noticeably alter the vehicle sound either
- Removed the auction house, which was a really fun way to get new vehicles and designs
- Very limited multiplayer hoppers, currently there are 5 - simply not enough variety to keep you interested for more than a couple of races

There are some good things:
- Fantastic handling model
- More car configuration options
- Great to finally see some new wheel designs
- Excellent multiplayer format with Practice, Qualy and the Race
- No noticeable network lag in multiplayer

Honestly, this game isn't finished and shouldn't have been released - I know developers are lazy and rush a game out to make money knowing they can patch issues, but it will take months to fix the bugs in this game that I paid almost £100 for. Seriously, the list of known issues on the Forza Forums stretches to 6 pages of A4!!!

The game is fun, in multiplayer only, that said, having to force close the game and restart just to enter a new lobby is getting tedious.

Without bugs, this would be great. Unfortunately in its current state, it is impossible to recommend.

BRING BACK THE DAYS WHERE GAMES WERE RELEASED 100% READY! Back when we had no internet so developers knew they only had one shot to get it right lol!

This game overall just seems unfinished.  The content is extremely stale. Everything from past games just with a new number ""Slapped on the box."" My genuine opinion is this, I've owned every forza game since x-box original. i stood in line at funcoland (Before it became gamestop) to purchase it. That being said, the game IS fun, BUT there's a lot to unpack there, The RPG elements should be for your driver's skills if you are going to go that route, not cars to make a dream build in a game. The AI is pretty bad, the physics mass of your competition is greatly exaggerated, meaning you can slam into them and they will barley budge, but if they hit you, your call is an expensive soccer ball. I think with major updates and few tweaks, this release can bounce back. So for now i'd say get it on sale, or wait until the major kinks get fixed. The overall performance isnt great, but not horrible depending on your specs, even so do not expect perfection, the rendering engine (It's an old engine they are using still) can't compile fast enough for most top end machines and you will get glitching. The sequences studder to about a low of 20 FPS in some places, but i still have pretty stable frame rates during gameplay averaging around 58 as a low point. You'll have to tweak a lot of setting to get your experience the way you want it, don't expect it right out-of-the-box type thing. i hope this helps anyone just a bit looking to purchase it. i say give it a chance later on and hopefully the devs listen to their players.",1697327685,1697327685,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wish I could have a third option instead of just Yes/No recommendation.

The positives:
Physics are good and the cars feel and handle nicely on a wheel.
Decent selection of cars from multiple categories, including gt, btcc and le mans prototypes from different eras.
Good overall track selection, with almost all of the classic old-school f1 tracks featured and a few classics from the US like Laguna Seca, Indy and the Glen
Great multiplayer with spec races with practice, qualifying and weather/time changes. quali with only 3 laps means you actually have to nail those laps and it feels very satisfying when that happens

The mixed:
Iconic tracks missing from previous games like Nordschleife, Hockenheim, Bathurst, Monza, Sebring, Sonoma, Atlanta.
The devs already said Nordschleife is coming next year and Yas Marina in a few months so I'm hoping all these will get included at some point in the next year

The negatives:
Horrible career mode with barely any events at launch. Not a single event features actual race cars like touring cars or gt. There's no point of doing any of them at the moment.
Braindead ai. If the single player wasn't bad enough every lap one feels more like wreckfest than a proper race. It takes the ai about 2 or 3 laps to learn how to drive a car and by then you're most likely fighting for 3rd place because 1st and 2nd are long gone.
Penalties, although a wonderful addition, are inconsistent at times. small cuts can add several seconds of penalties but forcing people off the track is ok

The atrocious:
The car leveling system, like seriously, who thought this was ok??? there's over 500 cars at launch and you need level 50 for all the upgrade options. Even if you abuse the self-driving ""feature"" to level up your cars it's still around 3 or 4h for each car.

+ Great physics
+ AI is better than previous Forza games
+ Game looks fantastic, even if I am physically unable to max out graphics setting
+ Online racing is way more fair and improved than previous titles
+ Personal opinion, but I dislike focus on high end Racing Cars in most racing games, so I love the variety in common sports cars and not just F1 cars or whatever 

- Vinyls/designs importing from other games is currently broken for Steam owners. Why bother logging in with my Microsoft account if it doesn't do basic stuff like importing designs from other Forza games connected to my Microsoft account? I spent DAYS to WEEKS creating many many vinyls and designs for cars in FH 3, 4, and 5, as well as FM7. All useless right now.

I can't enjoy any of the graphics improvements because I have to make this look like it came out in 2001 just to get it to run properly. 
I can't enjoy the improved physics because it each race takes ages to load and the goddamn track doesn't render in half the time. 
If it ran as good as FH5 does, then this would be a very fun zoomy zoomy car game
As is, it feels like a $15 early access game that shouldn't come out for another 2 years. PC was clearly an afterthought for this ""new engine"" and it shows.

Specs: Ryzen 5 5600X, RTX 3070, 32 GB RAM
I can run FH5 on ultra 1440p no issues, and even the old tech-demo-thing Forza Motorsport Apex on ultra 1440p no issues
This game barely managed 40 fps on medium 1080p, with constant graphical bugs
Tweaking the settings, the best I could get is medium-high 1440p with Ray Tracing off to run at an inconsistent 50 fps, but still with all the constant graphics bugs

After just an hour of playing here's a list of bugs/poor optimizations I saw: 
- When launching the game for the first time, changing graphics settings crashes the game (repeatable)
- Constant pop-in of props on every track at consistent areas
- Constant pop-OUT of props even as other props aren't loaded yet (I think the chase cam de-renders props as if I was in hood/helmet cam)
- You NEED to play with the racing line on because the track itself doesn't pop in half the time, usually at the same spots on each track. This happens every single lap the entire race
- My PC's Disk usage at 100% while CPU and GPU are chillin at 50% the entire time
- When races first start, it will sometimes still be black-screen loading while the countdown happens and race begins. No audio as well, so when I can finally see shit, I've missed the start
- When races first start, the audio is completely broken for a few seconds while everything tries to catch up
- For certain track segments, I'm given a segment score before I've even finished the segment
- Every loading screen takes too long (about a minute) even if it's just loading menus",1697320111,1697320111,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

- probably best racing game using a controller on PC
- driving feels great, you can really push to the limit and still keep the car on the track

Cons:
- the game can look phenomenal but you have to tweak the graphic settings yourself and restart the game to make them take effect -- do not use the auto settings -- they made the game look like utter crap on my new system (with RTX card).

(After turning down the centering spring and dampening settings to 0) I was finally keeping up with the top 1% without sweating too much on Sim steering. Curbs and grass are not instant death and you can finally ride it out after getting a little oversteer. It's not easy, but it's not impossible anymore. On top of that, it doesn't require quirky setups to achieve it. This is a pro and a con because the feel and dynamics are a result of steer filtering. It's not immediately noticeable until you look for it. If you start a freeplay race with no AI, 1 lap so you can get a replay, wiggle the wheel back and forth by 1-3 degrees, wiggle again at 180 degrees in either direction, then wiggle again near full lock on either direction. Finish the race and then look at the replay so you can look at the front driver side wheel on one of the camera angles. You'll notice that at 0 and 180 degrees and maybe a little past that, there is little to no filtering so you can see most of the 1-3 degree wiggles you did. At full lock, the filtering causes half of the wiggles to be lost as its limiting your rate of steering. I have a suspicion that this filtering has an affect related to speed as well with the limited drifting testing I did. In that testing I also was met by a weird vibrating behavior from the car whenever in a slide. Kind of like if the bushings were completely shot and I was either getting rear wheel hop or wiggling from tie rod play. The steering filtering may be attributing to that vibration as tie rod play.

Aside from that slightly winded, knee deep assessment of force feedback/wheel support, there is a lot broken in the game. A lot of inexcusable content after hearing ""built from the ground up"" as the hype phrase on a game that has been in development for 6 years.

But this game even though the driving aspects feels really solid. i can not recommend this game as it stands right now

- The game lacks content, MASSIVELY. 

- Carreer is boring. (I prefer the old way where you could unlock cars by winning the cups. now you just win, only to unlock the next cup. there is no real satisfaction for winning a cup)

- Optimization is poor for PC.

- The car level system feels more like a grind component, than a ¨Fall in love with your car¨. How can i fall in love with cars i dont care about, but i am forced to drive, to progress the carreer.

- Multiplayer only has a few diffrent types of races. in the intro they show multiclass races. this is the only time you see that type of race.

- The tire physics in multiplayer is really odd. for ¨realism¨ the tires wears out. im fine with that, but i feels like it has nothing to do with the way you drive. but more how many laps you have driven on them. you can go from having plenty of grip in the last corner on a lap. then drive through the straigth across the start/finish line. when you arrive at Turn 1 of the new lap. your tires are completely dead. 200 meters. and the tires goes from plenty of grip to Bambi on ice... and you have no indication of this happening, until you try and turn the car into turn 1

- And one of the biggest sins, that i can not stand in any type of games, is there are progression bugs. the game can get stuck while applying upgrades to your car between Races in Carreer, if this happens you have to close the game down. and the race you just completed. does not count. so you have to redo it.
If you finish a cup and dont enter a new one, the game might also ¨forget your progress, and you have to redo the previous race.

If there is one thing i hate, it is a game wasting my time needlessly. The progress bug does exactly this... I have been a fan of this franchise for 18 fucking years. been through the good and the bad games. but this game just feels like Forza has lost it's soul. sold out, and not focusing on the community anymore, but only focusing on how to make more money..

They advertised for the ""builder's cup"" in career mode, where you're supposed to upgrade your cars as you progress through the cup. The caveat? You better not to, else you'll end up driving the same fucking race six times as I did — the game doesn't save progress after every race and it often freezes when you try to upgrade your car between races.

I have to say this is a solid racing experience. I was hesitant to buy this game since it was so expensive, but ended up doing so in order to race my friends and check out if it really was as bad as people said it was. Here is what i have to say. This game is a great pick your car and upgrade it to your liking simulator. There are tons of different cars and it is not as hard to upgrade them as i had initially thought when i saw the inclusion of micro transactions. You can earn points and creds doing anything you want in this game, including private multiplayer games with your friends and also in free play mode on your own. Yea, you can actually grind a vehicle you like on your own without too much time sink. It is really a breath of fresh air. And when you finish the races you get credits regardless of position. It is just a blast.

Another thing that concerned me is when i saw game play online, seeing very blurry car dashboards and edges of things in general. Turns out this is caused by dynamic resolution not being set properly. As long as you make sure to put it at 100% or more you will be content in a crisp clean driving experience with well designed 1:1 race tracks to their real life counter parts and beautiful environment scenery. 

And yes you can drift with a Toyota AE86. Which is my favorite thing to do atm. Again, there is a huge car selection to choose from and it is not pay gated as far as i have come across. You can earn all these cars with playtime. 

Overall i say if you have been itching for a racing game to play with your friends, go for it. If the price tag is too high there is no reason not to wait till it goes on sale sometime in the future. $70 is a lot. But oddly this is the first time i have felt content in buying a game full price in a while. 

Use your own discretion in choosing whether or not you want to jump in on this one, but so far it has been a blast. Sorry to everyone who has had a shitty experience somehow.

I've been a big fan of the FM series since FM2 on the Xbox 360 but this is a let down in so many ways. I'm sure this review is just echoing what others have already said but here's my thoughts after 17 hours of play time

[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]
- A good choice in cars from day one.
- Graphics look decent on the cars.
- Large choice in wheels for customisation.

[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]
- Career mode is awful (""a mile wide but an inch deep""). You never actually see any proper racing, and in a game designed about track racing it seems like its more focused on being a ""take your daily driver to the local track day"" simulator than a full blown racing simulator.
- The steering wheel glitches/stutters constantly when racing using the driver's helmet cam. Almost like the steering wheel is being displayed at 10fps compared to the rest of the game.
- Car progression system is [b]atrocious[/b]. Seriously, stop it. Change it. You should spend MONEY on car parts, and they should be unlocked at DRIVER level across the board. The [i]only[/i] reason you've done this is to force people to play the game more. You can't force player retention. Make a game that people WANT to play, not one they feel they HAVE to play.
- Money is pointless because of the aforementioned point, having to use CP to buy parts instead of money.
- Low resolution rendering of car images regardless of graphics settings when browsing the paint designs.
- No Nordschleife circuit at launch. Like the game has been in development long enough already and now we're expected to wait almost a year for arguably the most iconic track in all of motor sport??
- The AI is abysmal. They have zero track sense, will randomly turn into you (which then gives you a time penalty), push you off track, slam into you and pile up at the first turn in every circuit, and seemingly have impossible levels of grip once they manage to break away. If you DO manage to get out in front it seems they immediately forget how to drive at all. There's no middle ground.
- The penalty system is seemingly random and decides how much time to penalise you by (or if it even is a penalty at all) by a random coin flip system. Sometimes you run a tyre width over the rumble strip on the exit of a turn and get hit for a +2:00 penalty, other times you can completely ignore chicanes and cut them in a straight line for zero penalty.
- Online racing qualification system is also broken because of this. The game does not issue penalties but will randomly flag your lap if you go a pixel off the track, resulting in you being 3-5s faster than the entire field but having to start in 6th place,
- Handling of cars is very hit or miss on gamepad. Some A class cars handle like they're on rails and other S class cars (which should be already built as a ""racing"" car) seem to drive like they're on ice constantly. 
- Animation of the steering wheel always seems to lock out at around 40 degrees from TDC in EVERY car, regardless of the steering angle, or any adjustments made.
- People abusing the self-driving car system online to give them a false safety rating is very annoying to deal with, might as well stick to career mode if I wanted to race against AI

Steam will not refund me this game (I tried) so it's going to sit in my library as a reminder to not buy games on launch day ever again.

Yeah i know it hasnt that much content by now but this game will be updated/supported a long time.
For me as a amateur its really enjoyable.
The AI is not the best but it will be fixed soon. 
They use AI which learns by the time.
Before every race u have to complete three training laps before the race starts.
This helps u understand the track very easy.
Multiplayer is also fun u start with a Honda series before u can start custom or selected cups.
After every race u get a new driver rank which helps u finding better people to play with.
Performance is pretty good and the cars sound amazing.
I recommend the game for newbies and for veterans

- The game runs in the 40s FPS with an RTX4090/13th gen i9 13700k.

- Graphics look worse than every racing game since Forza Motorsport 4. Bad shading, very bad global illumination with a color desaturation that combined with the bugged out reflections on multiple cars give a 2009 look to the game.

- The game only runs in widescreen ratio 3440p x1440p in racing events, every other time you have black bars on each side of the screen.

- The intro races are the worst in any game i ever played. You have to complete 3 racing series with 4-5 races each, with cars you dont care about, and you have to qualify before each one. It doesn't help that the game crashed when i was finished with the longer series, wiping my 2-3 hours progress.

- The tarmac surface is disappearing randomly with a lot of assets around the racetrack. All you can see is nothing, so you have to restart the game, all for this to reappear 1 hour later.

- the game crashes or freezes randomly, wiping all your series progress has the game does not save throughout the 2-3 hours series.

- This game was NOT made from the ground up. You can recognize every bad forza 3D assets that have been in every forza game since FM5 from a mile away. The wheels and tires are very bad quality, poor 3d models with sharp edges and unrealistic shading.

- The Nürburgring Nordschleife is absent. The most important and played track in every game is not included in the game at release. I'm one of those Ring racers that play 90% of every racing game or simulator on Nordschleife.

- The upgrade system is horrible and inconceivably worse than every other forza game. You have multiple currencies, and you need to ""level up"" each vehicle to unlock painstakingly slow every upgrade for the car. Then, you need to accumulate ""car points"" to purchase upgrades for the car. I am not joking, yes you cannot buy and upgrade a car right away, you have to race 6-8 hours with the car to have almost all the upgrades unlocked but you will probably not have enough Car Points to upgrade the car the way you want. Sorry. 

- We all seem what this multiple currencies system is for : monetization baby! They are probably planning to put monetization in the game so you can buy ""carpoints"" and unlock upgrades for the car with real money! What a great idea.

- Tire physics begone! No more tire physics for this game, it was too realistic probably?

- The upgrade-tune and buy interface is laughably bad for no reason. You have no control of the camera angle and zoom, the put the car is a dark room so you dont seen anything and you are so close to the car you cannot see what wheels/spoiler/bumper you are upgrading. And no my friend, no rotation of zoom fo you. That was for the last Forza, not in 2023.

- Car sounds are always been bad since Forza Horizon 2. But now they have done something very special, they have added microphone distortion noises all over you favorite vehicles sounds. This sound to me like they are using a Iphone 7 to record the car sounds and has the car overload the microphone capabilities you get scratching & distortions.

- The game keep reverting to French audio even though the game & steam are in english. When you select english, the game restart to applie the changes, and everything is fine, untils the next time you boot the game up, only audio will be back in french! Super!

- No auction house boys! That was too fun now you buy the car at the dealer my friend.

- The driving physics are very good. Yes i do love the driving physics of this game. It is realistic yet fun to drift around and you can explore the limits of every vehicles. 

- I love the new gas/tires simulation and i think that this is a very good idea, other than the fact that the difficulty keep reverting to easy each race.

Well, this game is clearly not ready to be released. It is worst than FM7 by a long shot, graphics included. They are bigs features missing like the auction house, used cars, and Nurburgring Nordschleife. The interface is horrible, the game crashes a lot and i get the fleeting feeling that this game was developed by the accountants not by car guys. It is so sad that this series has gone this way. I really hope they fix this game but the way things are going with Forza i wouldn't hold my hopes up to be honest.",1697299551,1697299551,False,4,0,0.50027763843536377,0,True,False,False

I've played and loved FM7, FH4, and FH5 already. This game has the potential to live up to those games, absolutely. Driving feel (on a wheel, in my case,) is fantastic once the settings are dialed in. AI is a big step up too, although it's still only okay. Graphics aren't stunning, but are acceptable, in my eyes. Car and track selection, although pared back, are still both great imo, although it would be nice to see more race cars. The upgrade system is pretty dumb, but doesn't ruin the experience for me. I enjoy sticking with each car for a while, and slowing dialing it in. That said, there are many better ways to implement that, so the existing system is definitely a strike against them.

So the game itself is great, when working well. However, in 12 hours, I've experienced around 1 crash per hour, that has either crashed to desktop, or hit an infinite loading screen, forcing me to Alt + F4 the game.

Whenever it does this soon after a race, it loses my last 1-2 races of progress. As a result, I've probably had to redo about 3 hours worth of races, which is really unacceptable, especially as I usually only have a few hours of game time each week.

Additionally, whenever I try to use FSR2, my game locks up and requires a restart. 

The game also requires an internet connection for anything other than freeplay, which is disappointing, as I live far out in the country, and internet is often unreliable.

Overall, I think the game has the makings of an 8-9/10, and I really enjoy it when it works. But with all of the performance issues currently ruining the game, I'd give it a month or two to get fixed up.",1697299027,1697299027,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

cant really use any car youd want in career.
you will have to get each car to level 10 at least, just to have the basics. 
so many missed opportunities for customization of builds. 
no cheap welded diff option thats maybe prone to breaking after so many laps? hard difficulty*
gslse rx7 has factory lsd, not great but its there, but not in forza. super cars get their lsds though.
they could have made it so once stock lsd diffs gets hot after so many laps it becomes inconsistent with lock up making it unpredictable. hard difficulty*
could have been really fun.
they could have done so much more. such a disappointment. 
but dont worry, so many wheel choices and they only cost 25 cxp, and are not level capped for you stance boiz in photo mode which got a huge makeover.
waited years for FM to come back to PC after the FM7 fiasco just for this ish.
i should add graphics are meh like NFS pro street on ps3 with true 1080p back in the day when that was top notch. FH5 looks better. 
track selection is dull. again fujimi was left out. like come on.
i dont just drift either. wheres tsukuba? for real. just pass before you wait hours for the game to level up each car for you in free play like im doing just to enjoy driving cars i want to build. 26 hours, thats how long it took to level my cosmo to 50 and i only had 10k cxp. not close to enough for all upgrades

For some of the things I enjoyed and actually think are really good.
The new handling physics is such a big improvement. Feedback through a steering wheel(I have a ThrustMaster t300 RS GT)feels absolutely amazing. I can actually feel what the tires are doing and the different details of tracks. Loss of grip feels more natural even with some wacky settings for Force Feedback.
The way weather and rubber being laid down over constant laps really adds to the immersive experience.
While the new progression system is very questionable at times, it at least means you can put credits towards just getting new cars. It was always an issues playing previous titles, grinding out creds for a car but then not even having enough to upgrade it because now you're dry on money. While it feels alittle grindy at times, just using the car in events will surprisingly level up your car quickly. As well, it at least lets you get a good feel for the car at base before going ham with upgrades.

However its kinda hard for me to stretch it out so lets get onto the bad:

     Performance issues are abound in this game. Optimization is very poor and if you have any sort of upscaling tech (Nvidia DLSS or AMD FSR), this game just doesnt know what to do. I have an RTX gpu and the game will suddenly decide I am running AMD. This causes an absolute drop to performance and visual quality. It causes extreme frame drops in menus and microstutters in races. And if you are unlucky enough; game crashing. You would think dropping you video settings maybe a few notches down would help, but no; still frame drops and stutters.
While they did an amazing job overhauling the physics, there are still issues with the Car Classifications. WHY THE HELL ARE THE AUSTRALIAN SUPERCAR CLASS COUNTED AS GT CARS?! There are alot of questionable decisions on their choices on what the changed between fm7 to now. While it may not seem like a big issue, this just makes a weird imbalance at times if you are trying to go super immersive. And certain cars are just obvious go to choices so it makes any sort of experimentation non existent at times.
And the car list seems to be very very lacking. I understand licensing for a brand's cars is very complicated at times, but considering the overlap between this game and Forza Horizon 5, I hardly doubt it wasnt an issue(probably for MORE PAID DLC WHOOPTY DOO)
Track choices is another big issue. There are so little tracks in the grand scheme of things. So many great tracks just are left out. And it does get tiresome even after a few hours. Not to mention the lack of race modes.
Where is the drifting events. Drag racing? Hell even a open airfield like in fm7 for a test drive track.
I understand that the development of this game was HEAVILY impacted by the 2020 pandemic but at this point that should not be an excuse. Delaying the game by a few more months would have been a better choice but I guess thats what happens when you have to get the end of year quarter boom every game release has.
As for the career mode....yeah what a joke. This career is just as bland as previous titles. No sort of twist, no special things to shake up the gameplay.
It gives me heavy reminders of Project Cars 3 career mode; just absolutely uninspired.
And the A.I. is another thing they decided they could keep the same. This AI is an absolute joke. They never react accordingly to certain situations. They will just drive through racing lines with out any variation to their movements. no mix ups with their overtakes. doesnt matter if they are going to crash into you or someone else, they just drive through the corners and chicanes as if there is no one there. Instead of feeling like I'm battling for an advantage, i feel like i just wanna get ahead of the pack so I dont get absolutely pummeled.
As for the online experience. I mean, this is just as uninspired as previous titles. There are still rammers and still trolls. There are still connection issues and their attempt at balancing the playing field by locking everyone to 60 frame per second was for nothing.
As of right now, this game is a hard DONT BUY. I am just going to keep playing FH5 and get my Sim fix with other games that offer way more replay-ability.

The decision to use the car experience points (CXP) for upgrades rather than spending credits works very well. Graphics are very good and the immersion factor is excellent; at one point in a race at Laguna Seca, a flock of bird suddenly flew out of a tree next to the track. The weather effects are top notch for rain, fog, etc, but what is also so impressive is the detail factors, like during a race how fog which was there at the start of the race begins to burn away and sunlight suddenly appears on parts of the track.

The car selection is very good as well, although I wish there were more lower class cars, although I'm sure I'm in the minority there. All the expected ways to make designs and paint jobs are there like they were in FM7 and FH5. The upgrading process is very good and does vary from car to car. 

In 46 hours I've had no crashes, only one lock-up, no graphic glitches or issues and running on High graphics setting gives me a solid 60 fps at 2560x1440. I'm not using DLSS as I don't find bleeding edge graphics that important in a racing game. The game starts fine every time. I have had the situation where in the middle of a race there will be a pause and a pop-up message saying the internet connection was lost. I click ""retry connection"" and everything is fine. This has happened about a half dozen times in 46 hours and never twice in the same session, so I think that is more than acceptable. 

The car physics feel very good, not at a level of iRacing, but for most folks they are just fine. They are more than adequate if you are using a controller and even with my G920 wheel and pedals I'm very impressed with the fidelity of the experience. 

I have some minor gripes about setting up custom races in the area of choosing weather, it isn't as comprehensive as say Automobilista 2 but otherwise all the settings you need for doing any specific race are there. 

I know some folks are having various issues with the game, but I'm not seeing any of the problems they are citing. Maybe I'm lucky, maybe my rig is just better suited for the game, but I have no complaints in that regard. 

So to sum up, I'm very happy with the game and looking forward to more content being added.

As of right now this game is even more poorly optimized than Halo Infinite was at launch. On a 3070 at max settings it looks alright but I was getting about 4 frames per second, if I turn every setting down as low as they'll go and everything looks like Vaseline, I'm still only getting about 70-80fps. The game's certainly playable at those settings, but making this game playable shouldn't require turning everything down to look worse than Forza 2 from 2007. 

A lot of it just seems rushed and unfinished. Some things about the UI are brilliant but mostly the UI and menus just feel like a placeholder while they develop the real one. That tiny tachometer in the corner with your gear number is all you get. I'd like to see a digital readout option in the middle that more emulates the look of a modern racing wheel so I don't have to look in the corner of my screen to see what gear I'm in. Again, rushed and unfinished.

The ""grind"" of leveling up cars is new but all it really means is that you can't just buy a wheelbarrow and instantly supe it up to race against GT3s. If you drive the tracks well and can consistently score 8s or better on track segments it doesn't take long to level up. It forces you to get to know the cars you drive, and once you have some real experience in your shitbox of choice then you can do whatever you'd like to it.

The driving itself is fun though, so they got the most important part right.

This game will be good eventually but there's a MASSIVE amount of development work to be done before this is worth buying at $60+. In it's current state it's not worth it. Go play Forza 3 or something in the meantime.

Let's start with a list of options to earn money they removed from the game: They closeld down Forza Hub, which gave you a good steady income, if you visited regularly (as a result, they also hurt Forza 7 with that decision, thanks for nothing). You can no longer buy the mod cards, that gave you a nice multiplier on earnings. You no longer get income from your Drivatar. In Forza 7 you earned 20,000 Cr per level plus a free or a strongly reduced car or another extra 50,000 Cr if you didn't want that car, in FM you get 35,000 Cr every FIVE levels. The Forzathon is gone, meaning another bunch of generous prices has been cut. I just compared two races (same car and track, same length, about the same difficulty settings) in the two games, in Forza 7 I earned 110,000 Cr in FM I came out with 27,000 Cr.

You can't just decide to get another one and get that to the same level as your current one, unless you grind a few hours (5hr not even fully upgrade my r34, this is terrible) before using it[/b]. The only positive thing about that is, that upgrades no longer cost money, so the insane amount of lost earnings in the game don't hurt as much. Speaking of cuts: Content wise the game is not even in the same ballpark as Forza 7. I understand that they will add stuff later, but man, this game feels empty compared to Forza 7 and I don't get, why they've done it.

As many others have said, the leveling system is wack and gets very tiring very fast, let me plug what i want into a brand new car and drive it around on free play at least.

graphics are fine, sound is great, physics feel great, driving is fun and nice. quality of life settings are nice, but there are also some noticeable absences that were in FM7, not just cars/tracks but the way timing sheets, telemetry, tuning data, upgrade data, is shown, is just considerably worse.

The driving is nicer, but I genuinely feel much more at home with FM7 than I do the new motorsport. I do enjoy that multiplayer racing has safety ratings (even if they are pretty shit), and has a bit more structure in terms of matchmaking. wish there was more race settings as well

overall, 6/10.

Pros:    Exactly what the Forza franchise needed.
Beautiful graphics, lighting, and physics
More in depth tuning
Stronger focus on sports and race cars
More goal oriented campaign
Fleshed out car list with many fan favorite racecars from all eras
New tracks
Penalty system
Pit stop animations
TS020

Cons:    Some minor bugs such as multiplayer replays not playing correctly,
I've noticed my pov has changed a couple times after rewinding
More punishing physics than FM7
Must use a car for 1-2 hours to fully upgrade it
No F1 car
Not many campaign series featuring actual racecars
Penalty system

Comments:    I've seen a lot of complaints about under-steering, to which I'll say that the cars feel real in the sense that if you crank the wheel, you're not going to pull 20g's. 
The penalty system works well 80% percent of the time. Occasionally someone will hit you unavoidably and you will get a penalty. Fortunately, the safety rating matchmaking means that you will mostly get paired with people who wreck about as often as you. So unless you are a rammer, you wont usually get paired with one.

Update: T10 nerfed manual w/ clutch. Basically (At least with my experience on wheel) without any clutch or transmission upgrades. It takes literal seconds for the game to allow you to shift. Now idk about T10 but I've driven many manual cars, and it doesn't take even half as long as the game will allow you to shift.

I've had it crash on me only once, the graphics are completely in your control and almost everything can be adjusted to your liking. They really did their best to give you an experience that is built around the car you are driving. If you love the corvette, you will be taught to drive it the way it should be driven. There are series progressions that allow you to master the basics/ fundamentals of almost every car in game. The coolest part is, there are over 500 cars in game, and you can play solo or with some friends, set any track you want, pick whatever cars you want (there is a ""rental"" system but all rentals are free), set up bots to race against, set time of day, weather conditions, and basically anything you want. You can control the experience down to whether or not rubber is left on the track behind you while you are ripping around, giving you an advantage if the weather is hot, and disadvantage if the weather is cold. 

The physics are phenomenal, if you have a good wheel, you can literally feel your tires skittering across the track while they scream at you with some of the best sound design I've heard in any racing game. The first night I played, I got on with my friend and we drove Le Man at midnight with heavy fog driving F1 cars at 200 mph. You could hear the wind ripping into the cabin while driving.

But for me it's probably the best simcade that's come out in years, I don't have a problem with servers, I don't have a problem with graphics (and I play on an AMD card) all these problems can be solved in less than 10 minutes, but why not complain, after all it's modern nowadays. (crappy times) I'm going to do a classic write up with a few pluses and a few negatives that slightly spoil this game. 

Pros: 

Driving model and physics - it can be set up so that you'll be worried about missing the apex by 3 centimeters, but also so that a one-armed monkey could drive it, so everyone will find what suits them here. 
Steering wheel support - this should be a staple in any even slightly more serious racing game. 
Car selection - there's a lot of it here, and it's only going to get bigger as time goes on. 
Graphics - not really a deciding factor for me in games, but the game looks really nice.
Sound - very good, except for a few minor things.

Cons:
AI - sometimes I feel like it just doesn't register you at all, and sends it out there like you're not even there. 
Racing circuits - there are few of them, I hope it will improve over time. 
Menu - they are unnecessarily annoying.

Then there's a few things I wouldn't consider negatives... practice laps before the race, I understand why they decided to add them to the game, but there should be an option to cancel them without having to start driving them, another thing modifying the car via unlocking it by playing, good concept on paper, but in real life it's pathetic. But in the same breath I say , I see a concept in it that I like. Having a couple of cars and driving only them. Not having a million of them and looking at them. ( FH5 I'm looking at you )

If this issue is fixed soon I will update this review, otherwise I will just refund and buy something else.

UPDATE: I want to thank the developer T10Yaachts for leaving a comment on my review attempting to bring a remedy to my attention. After doing some digging it seems like a communication issue between Steam and Microsoft, as I never get the option to sign into my Microsoft account while the game is loading, hence why the game never makes it past the shader optimization screen. Unfortunately there is still no fix for this that works for me and many others, so I have just requested a refund. Sad because if the game worked I'd much rather give Valve my money than Microsoft, but I want to play the game even if it means buying it through the PC Xbox app. For reference, my Forza Motorsport 7 (2017) boots without issue from the Xbox PC launcher. I have only had an issue like this with 1 other game from Steam (Lost Planet 2) but that ended up being a problem unrelated to Steam. Hopefully it works for other people, though. It seems like a really cool game.

EDIT #2: I can confirm my issue was Steam related, as I decided to download Forza Motorsport on Game Pass from the Xbox launcher, and it booted up and signed me in without issue. I am not sure why this happens for some people, but it definitely needs to be fixed. The game is actually pretty decent in its current state. Obviously there are some things that need to be fixed but overall I enjoy it. The physics are probably the most welcomed change from Forza Motorsport 7. There is a massive difference in grip communication even through an Xbox controller. I recommend the game, but if Steam version does not load for you, just request a refund and go through the Xbox app. It sucks to not get the achievements and what not for your Steam profile, but the game is worth playing through the Xbox launcher, and worth purchasing.",1697087620,1697205073,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

If you play more than a few hours, you can see that a lot of effort has been put into the game:

The good:

- Inspecting the car, we can see engine details, interior details
- Easy access to telemetry while driving, accurate, easy to read, in depth info.
- Tuning is easy, can see lap time, 0-60, 0-100
- Wheel setup was seamless, and default settings were decent enough to be ''plug and play''.
- Driving physics are good, especially in simulation mode, you can feel the car and the track.
- Dynamic weather, wide range of weather and time of day available for all tracks.
- Car sounds are generally good and accurate
- Some cars have unique upgrade options that reflect their IRL characteristics.


Not so good:

- VERY bad default car tuning / all cars understeer and slip heavily / the game sets you up for failure.
- Performance must be improved
- Graphic and visual glitches happen from time to time
- Leveling cars doesn't feel rewarding and is borderline boring
- Menu navigation could be improved
- Locked to 60fps for multiplayer
- Unable to skip training immediately, have to go to training to skip it
- Tire compound is locked to car level 11
- Multiplayer does not allow car upgrades, so you cannot always choose tire compound.
- No drift mode available

The long version.. First of all, to clarify the perspective from which I'm looking at this I've mostly played the older SMS games, Shift 2 and Project CARS (the first one) and recently got started on Assetto Corsa Competizione, so I'd call myself a semi-casual not-quite-simracer. I play with a Logitech G920 wheel exclusively, can't say anything to gamepad playability (but I'm hearing it's good). I'll try to break down my thoughts per category..

[h3]Physics / Driving[/h3]
Initially, I noticed that the default force feedback settings didn't feel right, but I got that fixed after about 10minutes of googling, there's a lot of good settings out there. After getting initial setup out of the way, most cars drive in a believable way, feedback is okay, and I'd say the overall driving experience is on par with - if not slightly better than - the first Project CARS, but not as detailed and intuitive-feeling as ACC (which I think isn't a fair comparison). The main issues I noticed are
- little to no wheel feedback on curbs: Even though loading tires on curbs makes you lose traction quite easily, you don't feel much on the wheel when you're on curbs. I'd hope they improve that in a patch some day.
- Assists are missing a setting like ""realistic"", where you get exactly the assists the car has in the real world. As a lot of people have pointed out, driving GT3 cars without ABS and traction control (which they have IRL and aren't meant to be driven without) is pretty hard and doesn't feel sensible.

[h3]Singleplayer[/h3]
I'm in the second tour of the career by now and enjoy it so far. The car-point based progression system where you have to drive the car in order to earn points that you can invest into upgrades is something new and an idea I kinda like. You get to start with a stock car which handles like a tank that's just plain wrong on a racetrack (which I find totally realistic), and get to build it into something that can be competitive. What I do whenever I start on a new car is go to Rivals (the hot-lap leaderboard mode) and do a few laps in order to get a few car points to start off and at the same time learn tracks I don't know yet. Once you've got at least proper brakes and springs installed, the career races are fun and you can enjoy the further progress you make on the car. Yes, it does feel like a bit of a grind, but nowhere near as bad as a lot of people want to make you believe. Key is to use the car for more than just that single career championship - do some hotlaps with it, wait until there's an open series for that car class on featured multiplayer, and you'll get a lot ouf of the time you've invested in your build. However, the singleplayer career does have a few weaknesses so far:
- The race car classes are currently mostly missing from career. I do however expect them to get added over time - as of now, there's an upcoming ""featured"" LMP2 series. But since the featured series seem to be available for only a couple of weeks or so I'm curious as to where this goes and what permanent additions to career we get.
- Car progression isn't always logical: For example, you need a relatively high car level (11) to change the tire compound, which is an absolute gamechanger in terms of handling. I hope this gets a bit more balanced, maybe make the ""sport level"" compound already available at level 5.
- AI drivers: In short, the AI does give a credible imitation of a human driver in that it drives like an overconfident teenager. Getting rammed by AI cars is pretty frequent, they do tend to brake in totally unreasonable spots, etc. However, as far as I understood, the AI is based on machine-learning, so I fully expect that to improve the longer the game is live due to the larger training set they aquire (and I did get the impression it even got better in the time I've been playing). Also, it's not horrible most of the time, and it's kinda nice to see bots make human-seeming mistakes rather than just driving like they're glued to the ideal line.

[h3]Multiplayer[/h3]
Up until now, the only racing game I spent significant time in online multiplayer mode is ACC. Forza Motorsport doesn't reach the same level of clean racing, but isn't far behind. The race structure around practice, a short hotlap-based qualifying and short-to-medium length races is great. Doing a single ""race weekend"" takes somewhere from 30mins to an hour and is great fun. The rating system seems to work, I've been competitve (but far from the top of the pack) in most races I've done so far, with one podium and one win as the highlights. You have spec and open classes - in spec races, you have a specific car class (e.g. GT cars, racing hot hatches, etc.) and everyone gets a pre-tuned car for a mostly level playing field. In the open classes, you can bring your own build. Before you can enter any other multiplayer events, you have to finish the qualification tour, where you do 3 races in a racing version of a Honda Civic, which the game uses to determine your safety and skill rating. The multiplayer series vary on a weekly basis - some classes like Touring Cars and GT are always there, others are time-limited. I expect this way we'll be able to get a chance to use all those cars we built up in the career sooner or later when the right multiplayer series is there. The current Formual Mazda spec series is where I had some of the most thrilling races ever, and I really urge veryone to try the online mode of Forza Motorsport! However, there's still some room for improvement:
- The penalty system is a bit too forgiving right now: When someone rams me needlessly and costs me the race, I expect them to get a bit more than, say, a 4-second penalty added to their total race time - this should be more like a 30 second drive-through or sth. Once again, I think the penalties are machine-learning based, so I expect this to get better over time.
- Most races are relatively short. While that's nice if you don't have that much time, it would be nice to be able to do something where you need more than one pit stop and can do a bit more in terms of race strategy.

[h3]Summary[/h3]
So far I've had loads of fun with what is already there. The developers did say they intend this to be a platform that grows over the years and gets improved on and, quite franky, there's enoguh room for that improvement. If you've ever played Assetto Corsa Competizione, you probably should stay away from the GT3 cars - but then, ACC is an exclusive hardcore GT3 sim, which FM never claimed to be, so we gotta stay fair. It's a game with hundreds of cars of vastly different character, and all I've driven so far were great fun (personal highlights are the fomula mazda and racing Golf GTI). It's definitely meant to be played online and I think you get the most out of it if you spend like 50% of the time on single- and multiplayer. If you don't wanna play online, I don't think what's left is worth the 70€. I think a lot depends on what content gets added over time and how Turn 10 irons out the few quirks tha game currently has, but I'm optimistic so far based on what I've seen.",1697195139,1697195139,True,32,8,0.634612381458282471,0,True,False,False

As for the actual game, it's a vast improvement over FM7: the new physics are familiar but more refined and rewarding, so the driving itself feels top-notch. The AI can be dumb, especially when grouped up, but they grow much more competent once the pack spreads out. I'm done with 16/20 Builder's Cup series at nearly 50 hours, so anyone telling you there are fewer hours of content than that is lying. I haven't even touched multiplayer yet, which of course will add far more hours.

The upgrade system is getting a lot of negative attention, but I love it! I've played Forza since Horizon 3, and this is the first one in which I've enjoyed learning to tune cars myself. Instead of getting overwhelmed by options and giving up in favor of just downloading others' tunes, I'm learning how to adjust each part as it's unlocked for the car. I hated having to purchase parts individually, so being able to swap things in and out freely as you build/tune feels great. The loop is satisfying to a rookie tuner like me, but I can understand how someone more seasoned would find it obstructive.

      time into one, I'd rather have the full selection
- You can break the game a bit if you put all the assists on and let the car drive itself, earning you money and exp. This is nice but devalues driving the cars and having the unlock feature in the first place.
- The career feels a bit short - which I wouldn't mind if other play modes would compensate for it. Other games often include Drift, Rally, Drag, or other Modes for Motorsport racing on the side at least in free play, this one doesn't. 

Nitpicky:
(stuff they should have done that leaves the game a bit unfinished in my view)
- Free play needs a thumbnail of the maps
- I miss some of the small details from the other Forza games, like being able to rev the car while customizing and hearing the changes in exhaust when installing certain parts
- Rim color changes don't show up for most of the colors (at least for me), Cant rotate car view while changing rims so you can't see what it looks like well, the rims are sorted alphabetically by manufacturer, which IMO is super tedious unless you memorized them all


is it worth the 100 bucks?
IMO if you have an xbox with FM7, no, its not quite on that level except when comparing the physics. 
If you want stable good graphics and are willing to mess with modding and patching and stuff, Assetto Corsa with some patches even almost outdoes this game, and that is basically free. There are lots of other good Motorsport options of course, which can be bought cheaper. 
To me, despite my slight disappointment with this game so far, I'd still buy it again for them Physics. But I'm a hoe for Motorsport games I guess.",1696931232,1697182687,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is missing drag and drift modes; it's offensive to me as a recurring serious player of this serious that drag mode was never officially completed for the previous game seemingly on the promise that it would be completed in the next game. After a 6 year wait, there's not even any information about its future inclusion. 

It is missing Fujimi Kaido, which has been the #1 fan requested track to return, in addition to other fantastic tracks like Alps and Sedona. I'm dissapointed how many real world tracks they chose that are graphically repetitive; just infinite American midwest hell over and over. It's also missing the freeform airport test track.

I disagree with the common narrative that every car needs to be remodeled, as I'd rather have as many cars as possible rather than what happened with Forza 5, where the car list was comically small because they didn't feel the previous models were high enough definition. The S14 looks fine, honestly. It's a weird looking car and if you've seen one in real life, the Forza model isn't really incorrect at all. They did cut a variety of cars that belong here, and I'm sure they will be drip-fed back into the game. It is what it is, but how can I not be disappointed they didn't make sure to include as much as they were able to from the get-go, especially if this is supposed to be the final major Forza game that's been 6 years in the making.

Online is locked to 60FPS. This point has been beaten to death, but ultimately, it's absurd that they chose that as a solution rather than working out exactly what programming issues are causing differences in game physics at higher framerates. But I don't care that much because I'm not ignorant enough to bother playing any racing game online that isn't called Burnout or Wreckfest.

Exclusively mandating temporal anti-aliasing was the wrong call. The game looks blurry, and it should be a decision to use it or stick with the MSAA which has been a Forza standard forever. There is something broken with the rendering; I will get 120+ FPS on ultra settings, alt tab or restart the race, and suddenly be getting between 15-30 FPS. It's just busted, plain and simple.

Homologation is gone, thankfully. What a godawful, disastrous system that ruined the entire spirit of Forza. Campaign seems fine, it's not like there's a narrative or a racing team or any of that goofy stuff. But you're given a genre or type of car and you have to upgrade it and work with it. It's a functional system that needs some tweaking. Car levels should affect your car points, but it's absurd to lock what upgrades you can actually apply to the car. Some cars have completely ass tires and any other sort of engine or performance upgrade is functionally useless until you can improve the handling, but of course this is level gated, making driving certain vehicles extremely unpleasant but mandatory to improve them. It's honestly a good idea for a system, it just needs tweaking, because it currently is grindy and locks things like bodykits behind 4-5 hours of driving PER CAR.

I'm disappointed how Forza 7 and then this game ultimately feel like immature early-access tech demos. This is supposed to be THE major racing franchise from one of the world's largest gaming companies, and it feels like they had a tenth of the time and budget they supposedly did. The physics are fantastic and what make this game worth playing at all in its current, sorry state. But they have a long way to go before I will tell my friends, who are tacitly interested but not hardcore racing enthusiasts, to jump onboard. There just isn't enough here and if I tell them to buy the game now, I can guarantee they would angrily refund it.

One last thing: Turn10 (the developers) have pretended to care about fan feedback for so long, but it's just not true. They do not respond to direct feedback, they do not take fan requests for returning cars or tracks seriously, and they have still not publicly acknowledged any of the extremely valid criticisms that are being leveled against the quality of their product. It's embarrassing; don't pretend to care about the interests of fans if you clearly have a boardroom executive deciding what goes where and if the game comes out before it's ready. They publish a day one bug list longer than a college essay but don't have the courage and humility to apologize for selling us an $100 game that just isn't finished at all. I know they despise us. They want casual people to pick this game up and not worry about any of these things. But they need to realize that the only reason my friends, who are not hardcore fans, would buy this game is because we, the real dedicated crowd, tell them to.",1697175160,1697175594,False,7,0,0.555205166339874268,0,True,False,False

Progress will not save properly. Every time I open the game I find that I have lost anywhere from 30m to 2hrs+ of career and event progression. (Only money and exp is saved).

The game constantly gets stuck in infinitely loading pop ups when purchasing, modifying or painting vehicles. The only solution is to close the game and relaunch. 

Sometimes the game thinks I am pressing pause every time I exit the pause menu. The only solution is to relaunch the game. 

When starting a race or practice (if taking over from already moving vehicle) the game thinks I am pushing the clutch in all the way for a couple of seconds no matter what inputs I make (if any) which sometimes causes accidents or makes me spin out or go wide on a corner. 

The game has FPS stutter and drops at random times, usually at the start of races and no, its not my hardware. 

Sometimes cars don't render properly in first person cockpit view mode (ie. there is no window frame or mirrors). The mirrors often display the track and the weather incorrectly. 

The multiplayer has a constant warning that my connection is not good (OCE). Other players stutter and rubber band constantly. The game also hands out random penalties when swapping from practice to qualifying for no apparent reason.

The career mode is boring, the car level system is awful, money feels pointless and the simulation is bad. Playing with all sim settings turned on tire wear is so low that smoking your tires out does almost nothing for wear. The required practice laps are an incredibly stupid waste of time and after you meet the lap requirement you get to start the race, if you meet the time they set for you then you get to choose what position to start it but it encourages you to start from the back to make more of that useless money. 

The career mode is so frustrating from the beginning of the game, I hate the typical starting off with some lame super car or race only car. It was so much more satisfying when the game started you off with economy garbage and let you start building your career like you would in real life (For most people). When you finally got the super cars it felt earned and not like ""Well, I'm back where I started"". After doing the initial intro laps it haves you select a Civic Type R, STI S209, or a Mustang that isn't even one of the cool models. You build this car up and then go into another race type where you have to select a totally different car, you don't even get to enjoy your progress for at least one series of races. Why can't the game just start you off on beginner open categories where you can experiment with the cars and build them the way you want? Honestly these are the race series most people remember when playing GT1 or GT2 and the same with the Forza games, it is so annoying that the developers are so worried about you easily winning a race that they can't let you have fun.... in a video game. For anyone reading this and thinking that this isn't a game but it is a simulator, that is even worse. Very few, if any races leagues are going to allow you to start off driving a Mclaren instead of starting off driving something like a GR86 or MX-5/Miata because they want you to prove you have the skills to drive more powerful cars without killing yourself. A lot of racing leagues even limit you to driving FWD then AWD and finally RWD and no driving around a local church parking lot during an autocross event does not qualify as a real racing league, there is a reason they only want you to have a helmet and a license.

Upgrades locked behind the car level is an awful choice and takes away so much of the fun the previous games had, especially when every car feels like you are driving a Hummer EV and weight reduction is locked behind so many levels that you likely wont be able to use it until you are past the point of using that car. If car levels weren't a thing this wouldn't be an issue. Let us spend some of that useless money on the upgrades instead of ""Car Points"". Let players who want to build overpowered cars based off of knowledge of how the car rating system works build overpowered cars from the start if that is what they want to do. For those that don't they can choose fair upgrade paths or not upgrade at all, stop the useless hand holding it is killing replayability. Sometimes you want to do another play through where you are stomping the AI with a 600hp Civic with every mod imaginable and other times you want to do it with as few mods as possible or try to figure out what is the most impactful single mod. Instead the game wants you to pick from lame upgrades that rarely address the issue you are actually having with the car. Have massive understeer? Sure you can do a bit of tuning but anything that will help resolve the problem is locked behind several levels. In most cases whatever problem you have with the car wont be able to be solved with the levels you get in that series, and since the game wants you to purchase a new car for piratically every single series you won't even get to use those mods once you have unlocked them. 


Sometimes you will go ""off track"" when you aren't over the line at all and others it will let you just ram through a corner with no penalty. I think this may be addressed in the future but with modern video game updates who knows, they may decide to never fix a single bug.

I don't play online at all so keep that in mind when reading my review. I only play for the career mode in all of these games.

I am a sim racing enthusiast and generally I prefer games to be as realistic as possible. I am using a Fanatec Podium DD1 wheel and V3 pedals. I think the ""Motorsport"" series should be a sim as we already have the ""Horizon"" series for arcade enthusiasts. And lets be real, if you are driving, you need a wheel not a gamepad!
 
Physics: 
I think overall the physics are pretty good. The only big complaint I have is really the lag between when I turn the wheel and when the wheel turns in the game. You have to think about a half second ahead. I find myself missing apexes because the car didn't turn when I turned the wheel. Also, it would be nice to see a better implementation of the hybrid system on the LMP1s. The are permanently 4 wheel drive and can drift around like a rallycar. I have also noticed a lot of understeer in just about every car. Seems to be more than just setup related... Probably so the cars are drivable with a gamepad...
 
FFB:
With a lot of tuning, I was able to make my DD1 feel pretty good. Look up a youtube video for some recommended settings to get you in the ballpark.
 
Graphics: 
I think the visuals are spectacular. The weather effects are the most beautiful I have seen in any game ever. I have a 2070 Super graphics card and I am only running on medium detail. I have been able to achieve 50-60 fps at 4k. I can't imagine how good it must look with a better graphics card.
 
Cars:
Supposedly over 500 cars at launch (I haven't counted them). Somehow it feels like less than that. Lot of Forza edition duplicates that inflate the numbers. Love to see the addition of the 1970 Porsche 917 LH and Ferrari 512S! Two of the most beautiful racecars ever made. I do miss the 2012 Audi R18 e-tron Quattro though. Also love the good amount of historic F1 cars from the 1960s that have carried over as well as a huge selection of Group C and GTP machines. I definitely have noticed some inaccuracies with some of the liveries. For example, the C7.R and C8.R both have silver wheels for some reason.
 
Sounds / Audio:
There is plenty of adjustability in the settings for the audio mix. I definitely thing the engine sounds need to be louder by default and the environmental sounds a bit quieter. Some of the cars don't quite sound right. Most notably, the Cadillac LMDh. From the outside view, it sounds more like the Acura ARX-06. Sounds like a V6 definitely not a brutal, high revving, GM V8 like it does in real life. Crazy that this is so off with it being the cover car!
 
Tracks:
I know the list will grow with time, but the limited tracks at launch is tough to look past right now. No Nordschleife (already been announced that it is coming), no Sebring, Daytona, Road Atlanta, Sonoma, Brands Hatch, etc. Glad to see Mid Ohio has arrived finally though! VIR is back as well. For the most part, the tracks are well done. I believe they are all claimed to be laser scanned, but there is no way Road America was. Having driven on that track in real life, I can attest that the camber and elevation changes are way off at many corners especially T13 - T14 area (from the exit of Canada Corner through the last corner). It needs improvement. Even the previous Forza titles were way more accurate. I would also love to see some historic tracks from the 1960s or similar. Something like AMS2's 1971 Nordschleife would be so cool to see in Forza.
 
AI: Typical Forza AI here. Nothing groundbreaking. They aren't super quick even on level 8. They drift over into you on straightaways and divebomb into the back of you like Verstappen into corners. It works, but it isn't iRacing quality AI.
 
UI:
I have had a lot of flickering screen issues in the menu screens so far. Game has even crashed in the menus 3 times so far on me. In general it is pretty easy to navigate.
 
Other concerns I have:
 
-Lack of puddles: I miss them. They are a huge part of racing in rain. Would love to see dynamic puddling.
 
-Manual w/ Clutch option: Right now it seems pretty pointless to have it if you are trying to heel-toe. There is no option to turn the auto blip off, you can shift without lifting off throttle, and the car does not die if you let the clutch out while stopped. This needs to be fixed especially with all the great historic cars available to drive. I want to drive them properly.
 
-Free Play: Creating a custom race is way too difficult. When I put together a race, I want the car set to be as realistic as possible (ie. GTE's and GT3's should not be all grouped together under ""Forza GT"". I find myself having to specify Power, weight, PI, Year, etc. just to narrow it down to the 5-6 cars I want. WAY TOO COMPLICATED! Make it so I can manually select from a list of cars. Also, why do timed races end exactly when the clock runs out? Let us finish the next lap like in real life! Also, some settings seem to revert when you load or save a preset. For example, the race timer always defaults to 5 minutes. Ive done several races now where the races ends halfway through lap 2 when I thought I was doing a 30 minute race. Kind of frustrating.
 
-Tune Setup: Rental cars setup can not be adjusted. I think there should be limited changes that can still be made such as adjustments to the steering range.
 
-Upgrade System: I generally prefer to leave most cars, especially race cars stock as that gives the most realistic experience, so this doesn't affect me personally so much, but I don't much like the idea of unlocking certain upgrades at different levels for each car. 
 
-Custom Paints: The resolution of custom paints needs to be way better. Maybe it is just my graphics settings, but they are as grainy as the Sahara desert.

SInce then, nvidia has added the game to nvidia experience and the recommended settings work very well for me.

I see lots of people complaining that the graphics aren't very good and I think they need to turn up the detail settings. I think the best thing about this game is the dynamic weather and lighting conditions. I've started races in overcast skies with light drizzle and finished with it pretty much dark and pouring rain.

The ""career"" mode is a joke. It's a collection of race series but you don't get to pick which ones you want to do, merely select from whatever is unlocked for your driver level.  I didn't expect a full RPG experience or anything, but I expected some sort of racing driver backstory where you would feel some sense of progress beyond unlocking car parts (news to turn 10, if you have money you can buy any car part you want in real life)

I'm not a fan of online racing, so this kinda kills the game for me.  Maybe if some friends buy it I will try racing against them in a private session.

It's hard to put into words how I feel about this game. I've bought every forza game since FM2 and enjoyed them all to varying degrees.

While the Forza Horizon series offers a career mode with hundreds of events that can be run in each car performance class with opposing cars unique to the car you choose, Forza Motorsport offers a ""career"" mode with essentially one series disguised as several.

Here, the ""career"" mode is limited to the Builder's Cup Series, split up among several categories.  Unfortunately, unlike the best Forza Motorsport games (i.e., 3 and 4), it doesn't feel like there are anywhere near an acceptable number of events with varied class, make, model, year/era limitations, providing a varied list of series and events to participate in.  This causes the career mode to feel like there is no progression.  For instance, in the earlier semi-sim racers like GT 3 and 4 and Forza 3 and 4, you started at the bottom (F and E class races) and slowly worked your way up, winning cars, upgrading them to be competitive without having to level up a car as if it were a gun in Call of Duty - seriously, what the absolute fuck was Turn 10 thinking with this decision.  In those other games, you would eventually make it up to the A, S, and other top tiered vehicle classes, making it feel like you were progressing as a driver.  Sadly, that just is not the case in this game.  Here, you pretty much immediately start racing B, A, and S class cars.

Admittedly, I have not fiddled around with the custom single race features, or the multiplayer, which I hear are both better than the single player career mode, but I don't like that I have to work to make the game fun to play in single player - that should fall squarely at the feet of the developers, and I just don't tend to enjoy multiplayer in any game anymore.

Taking all of the above into consideration, I cannot recommend this game to anyone at this time.  If you're lucky enough to still have your XBox 360 or have the ability to emulate without crashing, go back to FM 3 and 4.  Hell, if you have a PS5, go for GT7, which also doesn't have the best career mode, compared to GT3 and 4, but is still a far more complete and exciting game than Forza Motorsport.",1697145189,1697145189,False,5,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The Product feels very unpolished and is obviously unoptimized.

Microstutters (especially when you look at the trees while racing with Motion-Blur off of course), Washed-out Brightness (Lighting) which i needed to fix manually with Nvidia Freestyle (GFE) after the driver release, No Exclusive Fullscreen, Hardcoded TAA when DLSS (DLAA) is deactivated (need to re-Sharpen the Image with GFE or ReShade because there is no option).

1. Please optimize the game. It looks much worse than GT7, but the performance is completely off. There are a ton of glitches, FPS drops, and the game just doesn't feel smooth overall for the package that it's bringing. It doesn't make sense that it looks like a 2015 game but is still that demanding.
2. The penalties, especially in multiplayer are laughable. I am rated 'S', as in the highest safety rating, however whenever I go online I feel like I am playing Road Rush, having drivers try to constantly ram me off the track when I try to pass them even if it means they go off track themselves. They often get 0 penalties for obvious wrecking moves which should be fixed ASAP.
3. There has to be more content in both multiplayer and career modes. It feels like a demo and not a full game.

Other than that, the game is fun, I really hope the developers can fix the issues and make it playable. It's amazing how the same developer managed to release Forza Horizon, that looks and feels so much better, but completely break Motorsport. I would've rather if they just copy-pasted everything from Horizon with the physics of Motorsport. Maybe sometimes there's no need to build everything ""from the ground up"".

Also, the developers are getting a lot of backlash on the issues above, but not alone. It would be great to hear a word about the ongoing issues and the plans to fix them.

Progression and Racing:
I wouldn't say I liked the progression system, is inferior, and the Cups are boring and shallow. Each car needs 50Lv to unlock all parts. 

They should have made more like PC2 and GT, licenses, GP Championship, and classes Cups (GT, LMP2, Formula). With road cars yeah but more focus on racing cars and setups, the game is still too much Forza Horizon and less a real ""Motorsport"" gaming. The car progression is terrible and with a low sensation of reward, again Forza lacks transformation in the cars, many cars don't have body kits, and don't have much depth in the modification to turn that car into a real race car. I prefer fewer cars, but higher quality cars to transform into racing vehicles. I can't stand the 5 LAP race bullshit, why practice? if you don't have qualifying, the game always puts you at 12th, you can move up or down by increasing or decreasing your reward, it's ridiculous. Why have a system of fuel, and tire wear if the races you do in the carries are these 5/8 laps idiocy?

The driving is good, nothing especial just good. 

Built from the ground up, its a LIE, many cars are recicled models, they did even botther to remodel to update the cars. Many cars read lights are atrochous, cleary from models for a game that was made 10+ years ago.
The tracks are meh at most. 


Optimizations and Graphics
The lighting on many occasions is horrendous too much exposure, the game should use a bit more artistic work.
The forced DOF is sickening, ugly, and has too much all the time. You lose half of the detail just because of the camera's DOF. 

The game has many problems with machine resources, can't properly use the CPU, and from time to time out of nowhere the game starts to drop FPS. The Raytrace implementation is subpar, ugly as F, and full of artifacts and noise in the reflections, you cant control reflection quality/samples, and you cant use only RTAO and no reflections, so for those who want a bit more FPS but keep the RTAO it's impossible. Remember RTAO in this game makes an absurd amount of difference, it's a must-have turn-on option.

FPS issues:
I understand the locked at 60FPS in multiplayer, in racing games, more FPS makes the timing and pace of the game very different, F1 games have a huge number of videos about it. But clearly, the game has problems processing anything higher than 60FPS, not for being heavy, or over-detailed, and because the game is poorly optimized, it runs well for sure, but you start to encounter strange behaviors and lack of performance as soon as you change to unlocked FPS, the FPS in pre-race is very low, race starts the FPS goes back to what you set it up. As I said from time to time, the game simply drops FPS, and only by restarting, does the game come back to normal. I monitor my system resources all the time, and the games do not max out my system at any moment, RAM usage is fairly low, VRAM is normal at 90%, GPU usage is 90% from a GPU core at low TDP, my GPU almost never goes to 100% at maximum clock speeds ( forza goes at 90% GPU load with 1.5Mhz to 1.8Mhz my GPU goes to 2.0Mhz). The CPU is sleeping, because this game refuses to be multi-threaded for an unjustifiable reason in 2023! 
The graphics options are simple, but not effective. 

OBS:
 I tested with many settings, high to low. Tested several tracks, different times, and weather. With no rivals and 23 IA cars, the odd behavior is the same.

I can run the game fairly well, my complaint is about the lack of consistency which is the fault of the game and not because of my system. I use raytraced: car reflections + RTAO all on High. The game can output 80FPS, but from time to time, the game gets crazy, low FPS in the menus, low FPS on car selection, low FPS in races, restart and all comes back to normal as I said before. And the system isn't maxed out. Maybe a single CPU core, but again in 2023 we still having problems with games utilizing multi-thread, we have had multi-thread CPU for over 15 years already and developers still can't figure it out? PURE LAZYNESS!!!!

They cant fix it because it is a Steam problem.

Even on low the game cant maintain 60. The larger tracks such as Spa, Catalunya, and Le man run noticeably worse and have micro stuttering issues. The night races have abysmal levels of performance, not helped by the bugs that cause your opponents headlights to start strobing and the game just seems to decide at random whether it wants their brake lights to work or not. 

This game does not look as good as the screenshots on the store page would have you believe. They pulled a watchdogs on us and this game looks much worse than the reveal footage we saw a year ago.

I've only had one crash to desktop in 20 hrs of gameplay (which was from a menu and I didn't lose any progress), and I have a mostly stable 60fps on high settings at 1440p ultrawide. RTX 4070. The cars feel awesome to drive, and I actually enjoy the new car progression system. Instead of just mindlessly upgrading to hit a PI number, it forces you to drive the car stock, figure out what upgrades make sense and create an intelligent build that both matches your driving style and brings out the car's full potential. If you're an ""I want to be the fastest RIGHT NOW with no practice or hard work!!"" kind of person you'll probably hate it though. The default FFB settings with my wheel were awful but with some fiddling I got it feeling really good. Same can be said for the graphics, the game both ran and looked like poo out of the box, but with some tweaks I got things looking good and running smooth.

Rivals is fun as ever and it ties into the car progression system nicely. Do a few laps, upgrade, see how performance changes, upgrade/tune again, repeat until you have a decent spot on the leaderboard. It's a really fun gameplay loop and it's what I'm mostly doing.   

The AI is super disappointing.. definitely not the giant leap forwards that was promised to us... I've had moments where they seem like they're trying to race me and are aware of their surroundings, but most of the time they just crash into each other, crash into me, brake for no reason, forget to accelerate out of corners, etc.. They seem to really struggle with the chicane on Nurburgring GP, it becomes a massive pileup half the time. They also have the tendency to give up on racing as soon as you pass them, it's like they are programmed to just be a moving target for you to pass, not an actual opponent in a race. I was hoping for some good single player racing, but alas that doesn't seem like it'll happen without a major AI focused patch. Ironically iRacing's AI is much better, despite that being a super multiplayer focused sim.

I've only done a few multiplayer races but the penalty system seemed to be doing it's job, the only time I got rammed the guy who did the ramming got a significant penalty and it calmed him right down for the rest of the race. Despite the fact that he knocked me off track, the penalty was enough that I was able to regain my position in the final results. The rest of the racing was pretty clean and competitive. 

So yeah.. I have some mixed feelings, but I don't regret my purchase. My advice would be the same as for any other AAA game, if you're even slightly on the fence, wait a year or two. You'll get a better game for less money. But there's fun to be had right now, and there's a lot of potential for this game to become a new standard for racing games. There's also significant work required, and I just hope that they'll continue developing the platform as they've promised.

Since Motorsports early access release last week (10/5/23) it has been a controversial topic in the racing genre and gaming communities as a whole. After about 40 hours of game-play doing several tours, rivals, multiplayer, and car building I wish to accurately and appropriately discuss the innovations and shortcomings of Forza Motorsport. This will be an honest and real review of several topics I wish to cover, starting with large front page ideas and working down to smaller bugs and glitches.

[h2] The Upgrade System [/h2]
First is the upgrade system, which is by far the most controversial subject regarding Motorsport and it has to be addressed. It seems people either love it or hate it. The car leveling system with Car Points (CP) is a great idea to force players to drive and learn the qualities of each car to guide them throughout their build as they unlock new parts over time, starting with small starter mods such as brake kits and air filters, working up to more complex components and ending with full engine and drivetrain swaps. This slower progression means we won't see V12 AWD swapped Miatas on every circuit and will most likely deter or limit the rise of meta cars being overpowered in multiplayer lobbies. 

However, it does have a few shortcomings. Mainly, the car level does not transfer with the purchase of new cars. For example, If I level up a 2018 Mustang GT to level 20 and decide I want a second 2018 Mustang GT, that second mustang will be level 1, which forces me to grind through an unlock tree I had already progressed through. The current solution to this is the setup manager, which allows car modifications and tunes to all be saved and loaded at the click of a button, so no constantly changing out parts depending on the circuit or class desired. Another possible issue I had noted was that each unlock tree is identical regardless of the car being leveled. Every car starts with air filters, brake kits, and oil coolers, and unlocks tire compound at level 11 and weight reduction at level 20, and so on. While I agree that larger components should be saved till the end, it might be worth changing some of the unlock levels are depending on the car type or category to prevent all builds feeling the same.

One large rework that might work well and make everyone happy is to keep the car leveling and car points system, but rather than unlocking new components as you go, everything is unlocked from the beginning and its just a matter of how many car points you have and wish to allocate to certain components. Whereas rather than spending 2000 car points on new air filters, intake manifolds, coilovers, and aero. I could just spend those 2000 points on a weight reduction.

[h2] The Track List [/h2]

This is my only real disappointment with the game at launch. As of this review, the game has 20 tracks available to play, each with 2 or 3 different layouts to choose from. This sounds like a lot but after about a dozen hours I had basically played every track and layout and was able to set consistent lap times regardless of car category or class. While I do understand that Turn 10 is re-scanning all of the IRL tracks with laser technology to most accurately portray these racetracks, we could have at least gotten fan favorites from previous titles like Rio De Janeiro from FM6, Prague from FM5, or my personal favorite Bernese Alps from FM4. The developers did mention they will be adding the Nordschleife shortly and will continue adding tracks as time progresses, but I feel the track list was lackluster at launch.

[h2] The Car List [/h2]

Cars are the heart of every racing game and the utmost care and consideration should be used when making the car list of a large racing game. While the cars in Motorsport drive and feel fantastic and the game covers many genres of racing with the cars included, I can't help but feel that the car list is incomplete. The game has a little over 500 cars at launch but is missing some big ones. No Veyron, no SRT Chrysler, no Jeep, compared to FH5 that has nearly 800 cars, with some from each of these manufacturers. I know there have been licensing issues with Toyota and Lotus, and probably other manufacturers in the past that developers are dealing with but for waiting nearly 7 years for the next Motorsport title, I feel there was plenty of time to address these issues. 

This takes me to something I fear the developers may be doing regarding the car list. Although I don't have any evidence to back up my claim, with massive companies like Microsoft and Turn 10 at the helm, I don't think that they only held the license to use these 500-ish cars for the Motorsport title. I believe that they actual have the licenses to use almost the full 800 cars in FH5, but are secretly holding cars back from launch so they can be added later as DLC or part of the car pass, but this is only a theory.

[h2] Physics and Handling [/h2]

Before this section it is important to note that all of my experience has been using a wheel/pedals/shifter combo. With that being said, the physics in Motorsport is a huge leap forward regarding how cars feel and maneuver on the track. The cars still feel like they have weight, but now they feel as though they have slightly more grip and not in an arcade-y way. While it is still easy to upset the car and lose control, it really feels as though you're driving a real car with rubber on the road. This is especially true when attempting to recover the car. I have very limited experience on a real race track in a real car, but when the car starts to slide and you counter-steer, the car suddenly regains traction and if you aren't ready for it will spin out the other direction, and Motorsport nails this feeling. It prevents the arcade drift-y feel that Horizon has. The only part of the new physics that I was disappointed not to see was hydroplane mechanics, such as in ACC. In Motorsport, a wet track has all around less grip than a dry track, regardless of where you are on the track. I was hoping for the track surface to be unevenly wet and have varying levels of grip, with standing water able to shake and upset the car when passing over it at high speeds. 

[h2] Force Feedback [/h2]

The feedback and handling of the car through the wheel in another large leap forward for Motorsport. The game has perfected the pulsating chatter feeling the wheels make when they're pushed to the edge of their limits and it is very easily translated to the wheel. For my setup I use a Logitech G920 wheel, pedal, and Logitech shifter combo, which works well. However, I have heard issues from Thrustmaster and Moza wheel users that the game is hardly providing any feedback to the wheel if any at all, which makes it impossible to ""feel the road"" through the car. I'm sure these issues will be addressed as patches are released.

[h2] Graphics and Performance [/h2]

The graphics in Motorsport are at least on par with other entries in the franchise. In some cases it looks as though the road, tree, and grass textures are lacking detail (which can be noticed even when driving and not just looking at the assets). The car models very quite significantly as newer made models have an obviously higher level of detail than others that have been in the series and were reused. But holy cow do the nights look amazing. It's optimized fairly well as my i7 and 1660Ti is able to handle high settings 1080p fairly easily with about 50 fps in full lobbies and 70-80 fps when I'm racing alone.

[h2] Bugs I've Encountered [/h2]

- Track texture sometimes doesn't load when I'm driving
- Rewind forces racing wheel off calibration
- Leaderboard not loading after a race
- Car crashes before the player has control in a race",1697126356,1697126356,True,1,1,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

Ultimately this is the best forza to date. I have played them all since FM3. Could it have used another 6 months of polish before release? Yeah but its still better than any Horizon game and blows FM7 out of the water in terms of driving model and MP. If you just want to roll around the highway in a flashy car like a baby, the Horizon series is for you. This is for REAL RACERS.

Its actually a really good game and they released a nvidia driver update just after release which fixed the stability of the GFX which for me went from 40 fps and jumpy to a clean 90 fps with no stuttering on Max settings. 
Now this isnt up there with Iracing but its a really approachable racing game. I really like the handling and you notice the changes from car to car. 
I'm not to sure about the car progression system it takes forever to level the car up and you get to about level 25 after one series then it makes you switch car for the next series. I guess its because the game wants you to try new car models etc but getting it to level 50 is way to much.
I like the tracks (a good selection) and the graphics are nice to. 
I mean its made by a developer thats been around a long while that knows how to make a good car game. 
I havnt owned all the Forzas, maybe only forza 3 but this brings back the grind but the game is very rewarding if you stick with it as it always was. You just got to get there and then multiplayer really opens up if a remember. 
The Safety system seems a great idea but not really had much practice with it yet but hopefully makes for cleaner online racing! (It seemed to the first couple I had online just in the stock racing cars.)
Now for the DLC - not a fan of this at all. Game comes out and there are like 5 car packs priced from 2.99 to 7.99, i mean come on its release day just put them in the game. Not cool!!.

For now unpolished aspects would be such as the game not saving input settings (but you can just reload the former saved keybinding after every game restart, this also would load the formerly set FFB settings) and quite some issues with the graphics engine. Last given is recognizable in a blurry image that I am not able to totally get rid off with neither setting. I think every other aspect you can find on every in-detail graphics analysis post on YouTube etc.
Performance-wise I can confirm that the game runs stable on DLAA / 5760*1080 triples above 60 fps (80-95 when unlocked) with my 7800x3D and a RTX 4080. But considering that being a quite ""okay beefy"" system and the not soooo great graphics I consider there to be a lot headroom for optimization, at least in theory.

Secondly, it was hard work and took quite an amount of time to setup the game with all components of my rig. But I got it fixed for now.
For everyone that is driving with an VRS DFP base you can find an description in a thread that I made in the steam discussions for FM8.

That being said I can gladly confirm that this game can give some big fun even in a full sim-rig (VRS Base, VRS Pedals, SimHub Bass Shakers etc) I was really supprised how good the export of telemetry is to the newest implementation of SimHub. I only use rear/front axis splitting with tire slip and curb rumble but that in combination with an good ffb setting is really good in giving you the feel of connection with the car.
For your reference I quite adore the simple stock FFB of iRacing with the onboard iRacing LFE, as its so humble but still directly connected (with a good DD wheel)
Due to the lack of playtime in AMS2, which I quite like because Reiza studios always were good in making FFB, I can not quite give AMS the acknowledgement it maybe deserves here, but I would say that I almost second the feel of a well set-up FM8 after iRacing, and this supprises me.

Physics-wise its no rfactor nor iRacing etc. BUT the cars definitely feel much more connected than in former titles, which gives you enough room for playing with the tires. Neither it is too understeery nor to floaty or to grippy.
It gives a good base for being a playground beside e.g. iRacing, even in multiplayer.

As some one that always was a Forza Fan and played every title in the past, what bored me the most in the last titles was the sheer overwhelming amount of cars you get flooded with, which made it something unspecial.
So I am really glad about the new ""caRPG"" thing so that you have to level your car up in carlevel, like a character in a RPG.
I can see points of peoples critics about that but for me it brings back the feeling of a car being special and it wakes the lust in playing around with all the cars. In addition to the physics aspect I can definitely say that one is able to feel a difference with every changed piece in your build what you unlock per each car rank.

All in all I hoped Forza was giving me a satisfactory playground beside iRacing as my main sim and the ability in playing around with all my wheel rims, my H-shifter etc in my rig even if I dont have much concentration and/or time after work.
And beside the existing flaws, for me, it works out at the relevant points.

The content is completely lacking, and I do not for 1 second believe that Turn10 wants to ""remake"" the Nurburgring, they simply just want to drip feed us recycled content over a period of time. 

So many features that were in the past Forza games are just not present in this one. Forzavista feels unfinished and lacking elements that FM7 had. No drag racing, no drift mode, no car stats to track mileage or win ratio.

First, the story.... actually give it one... am i supposed to assume that running a 5 race, club level, track day style event would net me 100k (just enough to buy the next car for the next series), and then continue on this until i've unlocked enough cars and money to actually have fun? Yawn, let me join an actual racing team and move up through the ranks and actually earn the pedigree to become a rich enough race car driver to have 50 fully modified super cars, the narrator is already there, wouldn't be hard to hire a few people to compile a story.

Second, the car upgrade system.... horrible for this type of game, i understand like others have said they want it for longevity but 40 or 50 something car levels to do any engine swap or drive train swap is absolutely a morale killer when I play games to have fun. Just give us the old system, it wasn't broke, didn't need fixing.

Third and finally is optimization. This is the worst running racing game i have ever loaded onto my PC.

Go watch any video of any PC set up and its laughable how many cars are falling through the track, graphical stutters, lighting issues, missing textures on cars etc etc. Devs have said there are fixes and troubleshooting but this is unnecessary from a AAA game, if im paying $77 after tax for a base game, i shouldnt have to do ANYTHING extra to make it work and if that's not the case, I don't want to live in Fantasy Forza Land where devs release shit and profit and we lose money and suffer.

Overall, for the prices they want, I can't recommend it. It’s just so inconsistent. It's not a bad game, but as it currently sits, it’s not great. Maybe after some updates…


[Graphics]
Sometimes the game looks absolutely amazing. The lighting, the track detail, the weather and the time scale adds so much to the game. However, at other times, it just…. doesn’t. It really seems to be track-dependent. 

Most cars look pretty good, but some lack detail and have graphical issues. They definitely reused older models for some and it shows at times. 

[FPS] 
On some tracks, I can easily get 80-90fps steady; on others, I’m lucky to hit 70fps. So optimization is….questionable. 
Still have yet to hit my “benchmark” numbers in-game with their recommended settings, btw.

[Physics]
Definitely good compared to previous Forza Motorsports.
The under-steer, though, sweet lord, the under-steer. Some cars plow through corners even at low speeds. Once you grind for upgrades, better tires will make it manageable, but something has to be off in the physics for specific cars or the set grip level for certain tires.

[Gameplay]

*Car Upgrade System* 
You'll probably hate this system if you want to build cars and race with friends from the get-go.

I do get the idea behind it. Getting to experience the car throughout multiple build stages. Getting to feel the difference after every level unlock. The idea is really cool, honestly. However, it has made the game a nonstop grind. Which I wouldn’t be totally against if they had left the ability to set race lengths in career mode. Let me race something other than short sprints for little XP ffs.

Also, the upgrade menus are basically nonexistent now. No more dyno charts or upgrade details. Which seems like a strange move on their part.

*Penalty System* 
Much like other features of the game, inconsistent. It’s cool and could be a great feature, but it needs some optimization. You sometimes will receive a penalty even if you were innocent in an exchange, leading to annoying moments in both single and multiplayer.

*AI* 
Still not great. They’re inconsistent (surprising i know) and sometimes chaotic for the first half of the race. For the second half, however, they are fast. Like really fast. Since all the career races aren’t customizable and only 4-7 laps, you don’t get much time to track them down, either. So….yeah.

It has a lot of potential. The best controller/gamepad driving experience, much needed UI improvements, as well as excellent new systems. But the PC port is just plain awful with its poor optimization, barren content, and bad AI. For a game about cars, it feels cold too, missing the enthusiasm of Horizon or even appreciation of its competitor Gran Turismo. Save your bucks and go play it on an Xbox console or wait a year.

[hr][/hr]

As a fan of simcade racers like Forza Horizon 5 and the Gran Turismo series, Forza Motorsport seemed like a really good time. There were things I always thought Forza did better than the competition and a new game with a completely revamped engine, what could go wrong?

Oh, I don't know. EVERYTHING?

First off, the performance and optimization is absolute trash, even on high end systems like mine that were equipped with 32 gigs of RAM, an RTX 3080, and a Ryzen 3700X. I recently got a drop-in replacement 5900X, but honestly, I didn't wanna bother testing with that or having to wait for my RMA'd 3080 to come back. I just knew in the back of my mind nothing would change, and that it would make me ineligible for a refund. Nvidia drivers smoothed the experience from pre-release but it still bothers me that even after that at 1440p, or 1080p, I had to crank it down to medium for a game that honestly doesn't look much better than Horizon 5. It actually looks [i]worse[/i] in some cases. 

Second, the AI, while impressive in its own right that it can make mistakes now instead of the pitch perfect line driving, is frequently the cause of all my problems. It's insane to me that an AI can crash into my car, cause me to spin out and lose positions, and the overlord that dishes penalties sees nothing wrong. The penalty system is neat but it's very inconsistent in whether or not you will get one. I can go off track from a loss of control and get a penalty, but in the same scenario where it actually comes to my advantage in lap time, I get no penalty under Sport rules. 

Forcing practice laps on the player is such a pace ruiner. It legit brings everything down to a crawl and makes a race take twice as long.

I think the worst thing of all in this entire package is the fact that the game is always online. Seriously? For what purpose does a game like this need it? What if my internet goes out and I wanna kill time while I wait for it to come back online? What if I just wanna be offline? It's ridiculous and again, it begins to make Horizon 5 look more enticing despite it and 4 being games that are MUCH older than this one and not nearly having the detail.

It's not all bad. Playing this on controller is a dream when other games feel too twitchy or too stiff. The segment system during practice runs is genius, giving you actual 1:1 feedback on how fast you're going through certain sections of a track. Not to mention seriously important UI improvements such as actually detailing when your car's tunings are making a positive or negative impact on things like 0-60 time, braking distances, lateral G's, etc. 

Despite this, I'd say definitely hold on to your cash and wait about a year before hopping into this game. If you absolutely must play this, get it on Xbox Series instead. At least there it'll be much more properly optimized and perform well. There'll probably be much more content as well as a more enthusiastic approach to the career mode.

But in the meantime, I'm getting my $100 back.",1697086298,1697087226,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Context: I'm an avid racing game fan, both arcade like FH5 and Sim racing (ACC and iRacing)

First off lets talk multiplayer, FM games in the past have had almost no competitive integrity due to there being no penalties for crashing into someone or using some way to gain an unfair advantage, like cutting a corner for example.

Well i'm glad to say that your prayers have been answered, this new FM game provides not only in-race time penalties to drivers who use dubious tactics but also an ELO and Safety Rating system to featured races. This means the racing will be competitive in terms of lap times but also will be enjoyable. Now i'm not going to go out and say it's perfect, the in-race penalty system can be a bit flawed at times and I can imagine some people will get stuck in safety rating hell due to the work of some ""individuals"".

The single player is harder to tackle for me, i'm not a huge fan of racing against AI since i just don't find it as enjoyable as racing other players, however i have been enjoying the new Builders cup. I personally love racing a bone stock car and finding it's weaknesses and leveling up the car to then get rid of said weaknesses. This will definitely be mixed for some people but personally I think it's a good change. Getting infinite money by some glitch just takes the fun out of progression for me which is why i like the new system.

Lastly i will be talking about the graphics and physics, now with Forza games they always seem to impress me with the graphics, the lighting is fantastic and new weather effects look beautiful if a bit over dramatic, but graphics aren't everything and a game lives and dies on how it feels to play. 
Now allegedly they built this new physics engine from the ground up which i'm not sure if i believe, it's definitely an improvement over past FM games but it doesn't quite have the sophistication of a game like GT7. All the physics in this game needs is some added feeling of down-force, in some vehicles there just isn't enough grip at high speeds as there should be.

Overall I think if you enjoy GT7 or if you like past FM games and just wanted something more realistic then you should pickup this game.",1697087074,1697087074,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- From an accessibility point of view, the braking/preferred line and sometimes the whole track is almost invisible in some lighting conditions especially at sunset.
- AI entering and exiting pits, and being lapped is not there, they will pull out of the pits into a high speed corner and shoot straight to racing line causing accidents. Some tracks its not unusual to see a 3-4 car pileup at the pit entry for similar reasons. 
- Had to redo a couple SINGLE PLAYER races because of connectivity with server issues, my progress hasn't been saved and I'm forced to do the same race again.

Not recommended if you like ACC, AC, or Iracing as this is still a simcade game more than real sim racing.  While they claim to have laser scanned the tracks, I find the way their models appear to have dumb down the tracks to make them easier to drive, so it is nowhere near as accurate.    For Wheel users, be prepare to spend time playing with the settings as the out of box setting are clearly inferior to FH5.  The good news is with effort, they can be ok.  But if you have a good DD wheel,  you will quickly realize how inferior the FFB is compared to ACC, AC, or Iracing.  

Now as far as fun factor is concern, I think FH5 is far superior with far more different types of racing,  better AI racing, graphics, and rewards system, so FM only real advantage is the safety rating system that does help make multiplayer racing clearner than the crashfest FH5 and hence why I do recommend it for that use case.   

But otherwise I would say play a real sim racing game or save you money and stick to FH5.

I'm giving this a positive review, but I'm going to be up front about a few things.

I'm running a decent computer and this is the first game that's given me real performance trouble. I've never even seen the word ""high"" in my graphics settings before, but here we are turning off ray tracing completely and setting shadows to medium. There is a LOT of room for optimization in this game at time of release.

I also am missing a few options from Motorsport 7 that were not included in this new version. The biggest bummer is not being able to set career mode races to  have more laps. Now I'm not sure if this is a balance thing they've chosen to do because of the new car level mechanic, or if it's just a total oversight, but it is a bummer.

The last major con is that the AI seems to have somehow become worse. It's particularly noticeable if you rewind on a corner. In 7, the AI would almost magnetise to the racing line when you rewound. It felt like a balancing mechanic. ""If you get to take another shot at this corner, so do they."" But in 8, if you rewind, you better have your foot over the break because somebody is going into a wall and they might take you with them. 

But that's not all. Turn 1 often looks like a SuperGT shameful rammers episode with cars just absolutely powdering one another sending corners completely blind from different area codes. Once the pack thins out, things improve, but you can expect the back 18 cars of a 24 car race to develop a 5 - 10 second gap from the drivers around the podium. I'm not sure what that's all about, but it is what it is.

But that's all for the cons. 

Lots of people dislike the car leveling. I don't. I think it's cool to build a car out over a series and get to know your vehicle a little better. It's also a good incentive to do freeplay or even just practice learning a track because your car continues to level even in non-series driving. I think it's great, but I wouldn't be mad if they gave the people who hate it an option to turn it off.

I love the addition of practice sessions before a race, and I doubly love the ""section score"" you get during those practice sessions that allow you to see how you improve over time on important corners. It's a godsend if you're trying to find a way to shave off that extra tenth of a second from your lap time.

The MOST IMPORTANT improvement, however is the handling. It feels a LOT better. Way more granular feedback and what feels like a higher skill ceiling. Throttle control is more important than ever now, with rapid switches from 0-100% being a sure way to spin out. The cars feel a LOT more like cars. It's still not iRacing, or even ACC, but it's a damn sight better than 7.

Multiple disconects and game crashes. Low fps on gtx 3080, long loading times even on M2 SSD. This is just trash console port. 

Leveling of cars is stupid, I ignore it and only play spec multiplayer when this doesnt matter.

Everyone is cheating with car customization, which I have no idea what to do with this crap. But everyone drive 5 seconds faster then me and its annoying. Last few days game decided that I am PRO so I am in full lobbys of progamers fighting for 15 place, really annoying. 

Best racing game is NFS Unbound, top graphics, top car handling, top customizations. bad multiplayer 16 lobby which just killing the game sadly. 

Forza has mediocre to bad graphics which is shame, some tracks at night looks just so bad. The amount of cars to choose from is really low, I play spec multiplayer R class and there is only 5 tracks over and over and like only one Ferrari to choose. really pitty. 

Game is not terrible but I would rate it 3/10 due to all the bugs and low amount of cars and content. 

The multiplayer is so bad, there are only choosen classes and the amount is really low, so if you want to play like D tier you are out of luck its not there. The best tier is also not there. There are fixed races, so if you want to play SPA some high tier with pit stop on high number of laps its just not there. There is one event with 3 laps of SPA without pit stop which is just pathetic. 

Game is not terrible but its not good neither. The leveling system is stupid and the upgrade dont cost money but some stupid cp points, worst progres system I ever seen.

The good:
Tires feel great (on controller), it sounds pretty good, and it looks good. Visuals at night and in the rain are especially good. Huge car list, modifying vehicles genuinely impacts driving characteristics, and the rivals section is fun. Better pit stops are here! Including mandatory pit stops. This has made for some fun custom races.

Performance:
Actually hasn't been as bad as others have discussed. I'm on a RX6700XT / Ryzen 5 3600x 32gb ram, holding a very consistent 60fps. While it should definitely be higher than that, and clearly has optimization struggles, it's certainly playable.

Upgrading:
I have very mixed feelings on this. On one hand, the new upgrade system definitely makes me want to keep racing with the same car - and I like that. The problem is, each career championship is so restricted, once I level up my car to a good level, I never use it again in another championship. It takes more than the duration of a career to upgrade it to it's fullest. I wish I could use the same few cars over and over again in increasingly high-level races, upgrading a 5.0 to a track monster over the course of a few championships sounds like a lot of fun.

I feel like upgrades could be locked behind levels *or* car points. There's really no need for both.

Everything else:
-The hand-holding tutorial needs to either be able to be skipped, or turn off hints. It's purely annoying. 
-No way to save after a practice session seems like a very odd omission. I went to the main menu to paint my car, and came back to the beginning of the same session.
-Challenge the Grid is okay, qualifying would be better


Finally, I feel like there's no greater purpose to levelling up, beyond upgrading my specific car. I already have a bunch of credits, and buying million dollar cars isn't necessary right now. I fear long-term fun will be lacking in this game.

Forza Motorsport came so close to being great, and has the potential to be great, but Turn10 made some very odd creative decisions.

Tl;dr, the negative status of this review is almost entirely due to the inexcusable technical issues that this game has, and may change to a positive review in the future if Turn 10 is able to turn 180 degrees and fix their game.

Unfortunately my review is too long for Steam's liking, so I'll cut out the part where I praise the vastly improved physics and AI. I'll skip straight to the negative stuff, since that's what's important here.

[h1]Forza Motorsport is, in its current launch state, [b]an unmitigated technical disaster.[/b][/h1]

Every other Forza game that has released on PC is one that I’ve preordered and played at launch. That means Horizon 3, Motorsport 7, and Horizon 4 and 5. Some of those games had a few technical issues at launch but they were annoying hiccups that didn’t warrant a negative review. This game and its heaping mountain of problems, however, is different. I don’t even know where to start.

Well, I’ll start by mentioning my specs. I’ve got a Ryzen 7 3700X, an RTX 3080, 32GBs of RAM, and the game is installed on a 2TB NVMe SSD. No, I don’t have a futureproof rocketship PC, but it’s still adequately decent and should theoretically be able to exceed the capabilities of a current-gen Xbox, generally speaking. The truth is that Forza Motorsport is extremely poorly optimized, however, and the visual settings seem to have no impact on performance whatsoever. The worst part is that changing any settings at all necessitates a game restart, because otherwise the game will overcommit video memory and make the game run even slower. Check this out.

Leaving all of the graphical settings at max (except raytracing, which I kept off), I lowered the game’s resolution to 1080p and then enabled DLSS’s “ultra performance” mode. This meant that Forza was rendering at an EVEN LOWER RESOLUTION (900p or possibly even 720p) and then [i]upscaling to 1080p[/i]. I restarted the game after changing these settings and then ran the benchmark. The game looked like complete trash. I got an average of 53 fps. Cool.

After this, I turned DLSS completely off and cranked the game up to a native 4k, forcing the game to render at that resolution 100% of the time, and then restarted the game again. Now, since 4k is near-as-makes-no-difference 4x as big as 1080p, you would expect that this would be AT LEAST 4x as taxing on my system, if not more, since Forza was previously rendering a picture at sub-1080p levels. But lo and behold, I ran the benchmark tool again. I got an average 58 fps. That’s right, my average frame rate INCREASED by 5 frames. Sure, Forza, THAT makes sense.

As of the time of this writing, there have been no Forza-specific video drivers from AMD or Nvidia. Lowering the game’s resolution will throw the positioning of the window off, resulting in you either being able to see a sliver of your desktop background on one side, having weird lines of pixels being rendered on the edge of your second monitor, or in my case, both. There’s the aforementioned settings bug that forces you to restart the game any time you tweak anything. The game forces TAA (temporal anti-aliasing), which causes literally any moving object to ghost like crazy and distracts you from the game itself, and you can’t turn it off. The game forces extremely aggressive depth-of-field, which already artistically looks bad, which is then COMPOUNDED by the forced TAA. This is most noticeable on the main menu, where half of your car is crystal clear and the other half of your car fades into a blurry pixelated mess that almost makes it look like it’s being bitcrushed. The visual options that the game lets you change are minimal, which defeats the whole point of owning a PC game to begin with. Not to mention that, again, they don’t make a lick of difference when it comes to performance anyway. Sometimes the game crashes on loading screens. Objects pop into existence as if my SSD is a 10 year old HDD instead. The in-game camera stutters if you have V-sync disabled, even though choosing a framerate option will lock the game to that framerate regardless of your V-sync settings. And did I mention the game is always online? That’s fun.

Forza Motorsport is a great game hidden behind an awful PC experience. I’d expect this from a third-party developer that has no experience with PC as a platform, or from some outsourced team that’s been brought in to port an older console game to PC without having access to the source code or something. But a AAA flagship game that spent [i][b]over half a decade in development[/b][/i] by one of Microsoft’s internal teams? That’s inexcusable. Like I said, I’ll flip this review to a positive one if the technical issues get ironed out.

2. Leveling system is awful (You grind a single car for 3-4 hours to unlock upgrades)

-Live service BS in a premium priced game.
-Clear and obvious graphic downgrades.
-MANDATORY practice EVERY SINGLE RACE. Have to spend an extra 5-10 minutes at each track, no other options. This + the car xp system turns the game into a chore. Edit: Turns out you can skip practice but my other points still stand.
-Car building system SUCKS. Can't experiment with car mods or just buy the car you want and upgrade anymore to have fun in MP or solo time trials, etc. Have to grind EACH CAR INDIVIDUALLY to raise it's level before you can mod it.
-No soundtrack while racing. Very boring after awhile.

I've been playing Forza since the 1st game on the OG Xbox. Honestly rarely been disappointed except with this one.

Without getting into gameplay yet, the ray tracing graphics are buggy, causing shader flickers on the vehicles. The detailing looked better on Forza Motorsport 7, and looks WAY worse than Gran Turismo 7 which was released on PS5 a year and a half ago! The menu is representative of a low budget game, where instead of nice visuals, it’s a basic font based menu with a bland background, vs the nice menu’s they usually had in Forza games. Mind you, instead of playing some decent sound fx or music, now you have some corny sounding bargain bin version of a James Bond soundtrack playing in the background. The loading screens no longer show pictures of the actual tracks, instead it shows their track layout interpretation in the most mediocre manner possible with no other colors except Yellow and Gray. Now the gameplay. The driving realism has definitely improved, to the point where on a wheel setup, you can feel more feedback from the car in terms of bumpsteer, road imperfections, etc. The biggest downside? Driving manual w/ clutch. First of all, the game doesn’t understand the difference between an H pattern manual car vs a paddle shifter. If you’re playing manual with clutch, this game STILL doesn’t know the difference where you have to clutch with each shift on the paddles. You’d think that this tech would’ve been upgraded since Forza 4. The other main issue is that the game has its own ridiculous clutch timing, regardless of clutch upgrade on your car. If you shift gears and pop off the clutch prior to the game registering that you shifted, it will rev bomb your car in neutral first and then drop your car into gear aggressively causing instability to the drivetrain. Finally I decided, well, if this sucks as a simulation experience, it’ll at least be fun as a portable game…… to only find out that it doesn’t work on Steam Deck either.

Most of us have had multiple, more than 10 in some cases, game crashes or soft-locks, for a wide variety of reasons.  Track textures vanish mid-race.

See below for more in depth review.

After many years of playing forza, from the very first on the original Xbox, all the way up to the latest, horizon 5, I will say turn 10 has nailed a lot, and miss some.

I will start off by saying the graphics in this game are amazing, but does lack in optimization. Granted I've been playing on a Lenovo gaming laptop, and have been keeping a consistent 50-60fps at high settings with AMD FSR, but in some sections of specific tracks it will drop down to 30fps then shoot right back up. For comparison my laptop is able to handle cyberpunk 2077 at high settings with a constant 60fps without RT enabled. In my opinion Forza could use some more optimizing for some hardware. Not game breaking though.

Where it really shines though is the new tire and handling model, especially on controller, you have so much more feel for the car, and can actually feel the weight and the g-forces through the feedback the controller gives, also you can notice when the suspension hits full load, and the tires start to lose grip, they did an amazing job to give controller players a excellent experience. I can't wait to test it on my wheel once I have the opportunity.

The car leveling I will say is not for everyone, Especially being a veteran of forza for so many years. But I will say that you do get a sense of accomplishment and attachment as you level these cars up and install more and more upgrades on them, and can feel and hear the car sort of evolve infront of you. It's addictive leveling them up just to see how they will perform. But the downside to this can be that it does become repetitive over time. I hope they will find ways to either make the process more enjoyable or incorporate different disciplines of driving to level them up like drifting, instead of having to drive as clean as possible through courses. But that is my personal opinion on the leveling system.

And speaking of hearing the car evolve, the sound in this game... Wow. I leveled up my R33 GTR to the point I could install new turbos, and a full dog box transmission, and I was shocked when I took it to the track after to test the new setup and was able to hear the sound of the new turbos spoiling up, the dog box whining from all the torque and HP running through it, and the faster I went the higher pitch that whine got! I got so giddy anytime I would punch it down a straight and hear this thing let loose all 800hp it had under the hood! I was very impressed by the sound effects, from the car upgrades to the tire squeel you get when your on the edge of traction, it has been fully delivered to you beautifully.

And lastly the multiplayer. It's very well done and thought out this time around. From the very start you are required to go through three ""qualification"" races, where everyone is driving the same exact Honda GT car, I love this because it levels the playing field, you don't have to worry about anyone joining the lobby with their 2000hp Bugatti and blowing you away on every straight in your little 400hp honda. The other great part of this is depending how early you join the lobby, you will also have time to practice in the car to get a feel for the car and track, and you are able to tune the car to meet your driving style. Then you will post your best 3 qualifying laps to determine your grid placement, then your off to the race. What I love about this is it reminds me of a real life race weekend, where preparation and skill are truly key.

Now to get into where they kind of missed.

The track selection is good, there are a lot of iconic tracks, and fan favorites like maple Valley, BUT I will say there isn't enough variety. Granted I know they plan to expand on this over time, I just hope it isn't with additional fees. 20 tracks certainly aren't enough.

The car selection is Okay, a lot of the most notorious and iconic cars are in the mix like the previously mentioned GTR's, Supras, Challengers, Ferrari's etc. but I would still love to see trucks in the mix, like the ford lighting or the Wrangler 392, some of the bigger and bulkier vehicles that also go to tracks and you can still have a blast in.

All in all, I would give the game an 8.5/10, it can use some more content but I believe that will be delivered over time. I just hope it's not behind a pay wall.",1697039421,1697039421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Long story short I'd recommend it if you like Forza/Gran Turismo etc I'd stay away if you are a die hard sim junky who can't simply enjoy a game for what it is.

Now the slightly longer version...

I've not played Forza Motorsport since number 5 that really put me off the series and after that I headed to PC, for the likes of Project CARS, rF2, iRacing, ACC etc 

But with this version of Forza being released on PC I simply couldn't resist especially given I could run my Simucube wheel base and Heusinkveld pedals.
It's a great addition to be able to run on a proper rig playing Forza and I'm sure it'll end up with more sales because of it as I wouldn't have touched it if I needed to use a controller.#

Single player is a bit frustrating the AI or Drivatars as they like to call them are possibly the worst AI I've had the pleasure of racing against. 
They will turn into you on a straight, turn you in a corner, simply run you off the track. 
Not sure if they are designed to be like that or simply couldn't care less that you are there but it's so frustrating to be rammed constantly! Racing is supposed to be a respectful sport, you give each other space to a degree you don't purposefully ram each other off track, if the AI was a real life driver you'd honestly expect them to lose their drive pretty quick.

The new car points is a long winded way of ranking up your car as the millions you amass literally only goes towards buying cars and not car parts. But it does mean you've got to race the car to get it to a level you want.
I'm undecided if this is a good thing or bad thing yet, loved the idea but 26hrs in now and it's starting to frustrate me.

Lets talk a bit about PC Performance? It's not good!!

Getting a stable 60 fps is a freaking challenge I've got a 3060-ti and 5600x with 32gb ram and all running on a nice lovely SSD yet I can't hold 60 fps on any race with most settings at low! My specs aren't far off recommended for high settings yet I can't even get close to turning things up to high.

Multiplayer

Is Great!! this is really where I think Forza is going to shine, it's got fixed races happening all the time in a variety of cars that appear to rotate on a weekly basis. 
It's literally where the majority of my time is being spent, with a safety rating and skill rating all helping the racing.
Although right now I'd say the penalty system is to soft for car contacts, because lap 1 is often chaos and more like Destruction Derby instead of Forza Motorsport.

Can't count on one hand the amount of races I've done starting at the back and by lap two I'm at the front of the pack because everyone is ramming each other off haha

I could ramble on and on about this game it has lots of flaws, but the multiplayer is fun and really does save it!!!",1697036033,1697036033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beautiful game
Mostly fun
Good selection of cars & tracks

Cons:
Initial settings adjustment caused crashes
Forced practice races before each race in career mode
Forced to level up each car in order to upgrade parts, not manufacturer but the actual car

As a huge fan of the Forza Motorsport Series, I am ecstatic that it finally came to Steam. The game plays well when it opens but does have random issues. I could not adjust any of the settings at first as it would randomly just crash when trying to save any changes but the game itself would play just fine. Crashes only happened when in the game settings. I was able to finally adjust settings but in order for the game to save those settings without crashing, I did have to stream it to my Steam Deck. Happened about 3 times back to back. Afterwards I was able to adjust settings normally without issue. Another issue is that there would be stuttering during the quick cut scene while its loading races, even the practice races, but once the race actually loads, it performs pretty well. Another issue is the fact that you have to level up each car in order to unlock upgrades for it, even if you have already maxed out the level of that particular car already & want to buy a 2nd one for a different race style. The forced practice sessions before each race in career mode is annoying especially when on limited time & just want to make some progress. It's even more annoying to be forced to do the practice race on tracks I've been racing for decades. We should be allowed to skip practice races if we choose to or maybe after that track has already been raced once.

21 minutes in and counting -- meaning I've got around 99 minutes of gaming trying this thing until that window expires and I'm locked in to an *actual* HUNDRED DOLLAR PURCHASE (in Canadian Fun Bucks) for a single video game, no DLC. 

so here's what I propose: I'm going to leave this review as RECOMMENDED, since I've seen very little at fault so far. the driving physics feel amazing to someone who's only experienced the series with Horizon 4 + 5 (I absolutely love 4). and I'm gonna keep going in small increments until I find a reason to refund this OR until someone in the comments [?] can provide any actual factual, unbiased and reasonable reasons that this thing stinks as much as many people are saying it does. 

muh specs is follows: RTX 3080 / AMD 5900x / 32gb. I had a stutter in the first lap with no slowdown I can see. it does *not* look as nice as 5 for me. so far.

- This is the closest game to what GT7 has to offer on Playstation
- Graphics are fantastic when good settings are selected
- Rivals is a great experience
- The controls and the feeling while driving the cars is fantastic (on controller, still didnt play with a wheel)
- Map selection and details are very good with some drawbacks (more under in the bad things)

Bad things:

- Unoptimized (It feels like I am playing a beta release)
- Some of the car mehanics and their handling is really weird and unrealistic
- Upgrade system is ok in my opinion with unlocking car parts, but the CP currency is a disaster and unncessary (why not simply make it so car upgrades are bought with the money you earn from races?)
- Co-op is a must have, I really like the option to play the festival playlists with friends in Forza Horizon 5. It would be cool if you could play as a team in career mode
- Where is Nordschleife? When it releases it better be good.
- The AI is really bad and unfair on highest settings. They dont get penalised but they frequently ram you. They are also too fast with low class cars.
- The hood and interior FOV is really weird even after adjusting it in the settings, it needs some more work. (Inside the interior you cant see the mirrors properly)
- The menus are somewhat unintuitive compared to FH5
- It would be nice to have a sort of freeroam map, kind of what Project Cars included in their game with a highway map that is ~20km long

Dear developers, there are many things to fix if you hope that the game will be the best racing game on PC.
This time I will give my recommendation because I like what the game has done so far.
I realy like how they fixed FH5, but its initial bad imppresion made me give a negative comment and caused some  frustrations.

Let's start with what the game does well. The physics have finally hit that perfect spot where the cars feel responsive but the game doesn't let you forget you're driving a 2000 pound machine. Rivals and practice mode actively push you for better and better lap times. Multiplayer racing is fantastic and fiercely competitive. 

Yet, the reliance on a live service model means base game content is heavily limited. The single player campaign is half-baked and only features road cars, not a single championship with actual race cars. Car and track roster is decent, but lacks many modern race cars, particularly in the Le Mans Hypercar category. No NASCAR, no F1, not even Formula Ford. Many of the QOL stuff introduced in the Horizon games are now completely nonexistent in Motorsport, including wheel spacers, extra options in the livery editor and camera mode, torque curve and engine revving while customizing, and heck even the liveries themselves are much blurrier than Horizon. The new car upgrade system, while interesting in theory, quickly becomes annoying in practice when you can't buy the right parts the car needs. 
Performance is terrible. My setup is no slouch (Ryzen 9 3950x, Radeon 7900xt, 32gb ram, NVMe SSD) and yet I can barely squeeze frames even on lower graphics settings, and is even worse in single player races. There is no reason I should be getting sub-45 fps on my setup on lower graphics and RTX off. 
Even after being in development for years, supposedly rebuilt from the ground up, it wasn't ready for release just yet and probably should've been given more time to fix the major issues. 

Do I think all these issues will get better with time? Yeah, probably. But if you're considering buying it day 1, it might be better to hold off for a little bit. The live service model of ""release it now, fix it later"" has resulted in a poorly optimized unfinished game where, while the groundwork has been laid, is still a ways off from being a complete game.

The car upgrade system, while a lot of people hate it, I can understand why it was done like this. It is to encourage longevity in the game, to keep people on that gristmill, grinding the next car. This is fine if you enjoy that sort of thing, but for a casual racing game, time gating upgrades, where people will often just pick up the game and play, seems like a poorly thought out idea.

The penalty system is good and an innovative implementation, but is an inconsistent disaster. There a huge issues with application of penalties, where an innocent party could be driven off track, or punted from an unsafe rejoin, only to be slapped with a huge time penalty for an ""avoidable collision"". This is while the person who rammed you off or caused a 3 car pile up receives no penalty at all in the view of our AI overlord.

This might be the best physics that Forza has to offer, but if this is 6 years in the making, I would rather get a PS5 and play GT7. The understeer is horrendous, every car in the game has it to varying degrees, which makes me think this is physics related. I understand that this makes it easier for controllers (i.e. the vast majority of the player base) but it seriously detracts from the overall ""driving"" experience.

The career mode unfortunately follows the Call of Duty trend of lacking anything meaningful. It feels like an after thought, an opportunity for those who don't want to play online to engage in some light racing with the AI. Talking of which, the AI is also pretty embarrassing; slow, clumsy, and irrational at the start of the race, but mega fast once the race opens up.

It isnt all bad however, the game itself looks really good, with some excellent particle effects and some very detailed tracks and the rating system seems a good enough implementation.

The game has its good points, but I feel Forza has missed the point; it has tried to be this compromise between being a casual experience and a proper racing title, but at the minute I feel it is neither. If the upcoming Assetto Corsa 2 builds on the promise of Assetto Corsa, Forza better watch it's back...

Game drives amazingly, and the racing online can be truly superb, but you'd better be content with that. This game offers nothing else, and takes far more than it gives. We've undoubtedly regressed since the last motorsport game. The car leveling is ""artificialplaytimeenhancer.exe"" and there's not a single good reason it exists, especially not in it's current state. If you want a game to take street cars and make them race cars, like Forza has always been, don't buy this, go play FH5 instead it's way better for that. This game isn't for that anymore apparently, and Turn10 made that painfully clear. If all you care about is driving race cars on race tracks, still don't get it because this game is indisputably, objectively bad. Go get ACC, or AC, or PC2, or literally any other racing game/sim. You'll have more fun, and you can mod those too which automatically makes them better. This game doesn't feel like Forza. It doesn't feel like anything for that matter. We gained the best physics Forza has ever seen, but we lost what Forza has always been in the process. I wish I only played for 2 hours so I could return it. Don't buy this game.


The Good Stuff:

Best driving Forza to date w/out a doubt, the multiplayer feels great w/ featured races where everyone is in the same car, or at least the same kind of car (Touring Cars, GT3 cars, Street Cars etc.). Forza finally feels right on a wheel (albeit w/ a lot of settings adjustments) and the track list is *good enough*, we know they plan on adding more later so that'll get better too. A good amount of true race cars in the game, including a lot of the silhouette cars from the 80s which is sick, honestly. The physics are fantastic, never been better in a Forza title. They nailed this part. I'm not sure how much more there is to say here sadly. Onto the bad now...

 The ""WTF Was Turn10 Thinking"" Stuff:
 
Removed hundred of cars from the previous motorsport game, and we lost improvements made in FH5 for some reason. Locked framerate in multiplayer races sounds nice, but the game runs so incredibly poorly that there's no such thing as a stable framerate. I fluctuate between 100fps, and 41fps, with seemingly no consistency in either direction (all on the same track for the record). The game is riddled w/ bugs, crashes constantly and has unbelievably poor performance, even on the lowest settings. Remember the improved photo mode in FH5 that everyone was so excited for? Well that isn't here for some reason either so we're back to the stone ages of photography for this one. 

We lost a bunch of cars from the old game, but they promise that a lot of them, ""didn't make sense for motorsport"". I already see a number of full fledged race cars missing from the last game so I'd say that's not entirely true. The S15 still hasn't been updated. Sorry S chassis gang, no luck here. Most cars are still re-used shitty assets from 1956 when FH1 came out so don't expect your 350z to finally start looking nice in Forza. 

The AI are fast, as long as they're ahead of you, and not around anyone else. The second you pass them they seem to just give up and slow down massively, and they still can't drive in a pack w/out randomly slamming on the brakes. They randomly drive off the circuit and just crash into the barrier, not sure what that's about. In fairness, it does make it feel more like a typical online lobby in Forza so maybe that was the goal.

The career mode ""builders cup"" where you're supposed to care about the car you choose, and what upgrade go with it is complete bullshit b/c.They toss you into so many different categories and none of the cars cross over, so you never end up using the same car for more than 5 races or so. This completely removes the point of the leveling system which was supposed to work in tandem w/ the career mode. Boneheaded decision to say the least. Oh, it also features no actual race cars, so everything you drive will handle like a bus until you get to level 8 and get real suspension. 

The car ""leveling"" (if you can even call it that, seriously wtf) is atrocious. I mean seriously, it's ""Noah, get the boat"" bad. If you want to take a Hakosuka Skyline from the 70s and go upgrade it with an RB26 and the AWD out of the R34, well I don't even know if you can do that, because just leveling the car enough to get to that point, will take you about 5 hours. 5 HOURS. I don't want to drive a car on 50 year old suspension and tires for 5 hours straight. Who would? I wouldn't have so many problems w/ the leveling system if it at least made some sort of sense. Okay, we're taking an old car from the 70s and we want to take it racing. What are the first things you'd think to do? Wheels/Tires, Weight Reduction, Suspension and Brakes right? Because you don't race a car on 50 year old tires, brakes and suspension. Weight reduction is a no brainer b/c that shit is free so always weight reduction. Well if you want tires, you'll have to wait until ""Car Level"" 11 for that. Okay, well how about weight reduction at least then, we can reduce the load of our old ass tires at least. That's level 20. Well shit, surely suspension will at least unlock from the start, right? That's level 8. You can get new brakes right away though! Brakes that completely outmatch your tires and make them effectively not an upgrade at all because your tires are still so bad, that your braking distance may as well not change at all. Wheels, and tire width come at level 2 which is also just so boneheaded. Why are those not unlocked from the start? Why is this system here at all? With the current leveling system, the ""logical upgrade path"" makes no sense at all. You get the stuff race cars actually need so incredibly late compared to just throwing more horsepower at the problem that it's not even funny. Makes any older car complete shit to deal with since it handles so poorly for so long. 

The online is buggy as hell, and the penalty system is completely unhinged. I got penalties for getting rammed off the track and thrown into a wall. You can cut a corner by a car width and not get a penalty one lap, but the next lap going one pixel over the limit is a .8 second penalty for some reason. It's inconsistent, and non functional in grand scheme of things. Just the penalty system needs so much work that I doubt it'll ever get addressed by Turn10. They don't exactly have a history of giving a shit about what their players want, so don't hold your breath. 

The car pass included less than ever, and the base game is now $70 even though they ripped basically every model except the 22B from old games. How does this make sense? They did less work, and we paid more money. Not how this shit is supposed to go. 

Trailer shows cars that aren't even in the game at this moment in time, basically guaranteeing some bullshit DLC down the road that even the Premium Edition users will have to pay extra for. 

Paint get's super de-saturated whenever it's darkened for some weird reason, and multiple sets of wheels refuse to be painted, and will remain their base color, but be slightly tinted to the color you selected. How does this even get through testing? Did anyone test this? Test your game ffs. 

Wow. That was a lot for me. I'm exhausted now. 

I'm more upset than I thought I was with this game. We waited for years on years, for a new motorsport game and this is what we get. I was so excited, I was so ready to stop driving around Mexico in FH5 and finally get back to a real race track, in a real race car. I guess I got my wish, but I lost everything else Forza stood for in the process. RIP Motorsport.",1697002967,1697002967,False,9,1,0.587414383888244629,0,True,False,False

and here i thought Horizon 5 was bad at launch

i'll cut to the chase, since if i do my usual review format i'll blow steam's word limit. so here we go:

- Want 60 FPS?! Potato graphics. leave it on Dynamic Automatic graphics, and the game will look worse than a PS1 game. if you want this game to look like minimally ok, the FPS will tank. no game should be running bellow ultra 60FPS with an I7 8700 2070 RTX and 48 GB of ram at 1080p. seriously, this is bad optimization, and it shows here. no other game craps itself this bad.

- Soundtrack is inexistent. i know what you all gonna say, but Gran turismo 7 has a killer soundtrack, and is as serious as this as a simulator. Project Cars 2 had a killer soundtrack on the menus, this doesn't. Even Automobilista 2 has a much better menu theme than this. minor nitpick for some, but not for me. this needs improvement for yesterday.

- car sounds are all wrong (Mitsubishi GTO sounded like a MB L1113 Truck with lower levels of upgrade for example),

- takes 50 laps of le mans to take a car to lvl50 on average and uping slower cars can take upwards of 3 hours or more, while faster cars can be uped in no time (not saying to ditch the lvl up system just adjust it for each car).

- Credits are ridiculously easy to gain, and i got money for the Ferrari 642,Mclaren MP4/4 and Aston Valhalla while i was uping my GTO and my veloster N, breaking all the motto of ""built not bought"".

- Design import feature is not working at the moment. which is a bummer given how i made a LOT of designs and stickers in Horizon 5 in anticipation for this game.

- Single player AI cannot build their cars in free race which again breaks the whole motto of ""built not bought"" (tested doing a single player race with Japanese cars and ID 640 to 670 as the rule)
AIs are Braindead. Divebombing at the first oportunity, Spinning other AIs and Me into the shadow realm more times than i can count,  and Rubberbanding to no end when on front, while going completely off the track when at the back.

- Assasin Climate, which just decides to pour on me whenever i'm in front and with Dynamic climate on. worse yet, without a weather radar and an engineer that can tell me it gonna rain, the weather becomes the worse ennemy. example: it starts to rain the moment i cross the start/finish on La Sarthe wich means a total lap of that track aquaplaning, and with no possibility of changing tyres before that. which is Ridiculous imo.

- Leveling up as a pilot is pointless. 3 20 laps races at Le mans old mulsaine with an A class car, and my level got reset to 5?! are you serious with me right now?!

- Penalty system is braindead. Picture these situations: You're at the end of mulsaine at 350km/h in the wet, car has stock road tires, you hit the brakes, but start to oversteer into the outside escape zone, but manage to stop before hiting the gravel. congratulations, you got a 2 second time penalty. another situation is, you start a race but end up oversteering at turn 2 in Laguna Seca, you rejoin as safely as you can, and start accelerating again on track, you get boped from behind by a Lamborghini Centenario, the AI prick doesn't even bother to use the brakes, starts to carry you over, spins you out and you not only get a penalty but your race is over with the AI in first place Rubberbanding like crazy, despite the vehicles being relatively same class. to rub even more salt on the injury, the game tells you it was an ""avoidable colision"", and is dead set to make you lose the race. you can climb the field all you want, laps permiting (i always tend to race endurance races of 1h+, time to catch up for me is not an issue), but that first place will ALWAYS be at a set 5 seconds, despite me and that specific AI leaving the field LOOONG behind. not to mention, you cross start/finish at Le mans, it starts to rain as soon as you cross it... if you got race tires, you will have one lap long of aquaplaining, while the AI teleports magically to the pits to fit the tires, while you can't given how the pit entrance is on your rear mirror. no engineer or weather radar to check if it gonna rain, so game plays against you.

- did i mention they used Bing Translate for the localization?! with iconinc grammar errors like ""Pneu Difícil"" (should be ""Pneu Duro/Hard tire""), ""Pneu Mole"" (Should be ""Pneu Macio/Soft tire""), ""Pneu Úmido"" (should be ""Pneu de chuva/Wet tire"") or ""Dividir"" (should be ""Parcial/Split""), just to name a few.

*Author's note: this got long winded*

[h3]Preface[/h3]
I've played every Forza Motorsport game since Forza 2, with Forza 4 being my favorite. I pre-ordered the highest edition for $99 without ever keeping up to date with the games pre-release info because I thought at the very least I'd have a new Forza game as a go-to option on my PC. I think at this point with about 7 hours into my purchase, I have regrets. 

[h2]MY core issues, listed by importance to ME:[/h2]

[h3]1. THEY COMPLETELY REMOVED DRIFTING[/h3]
I realize this may not be a popular number 1 issue, but for me it is top of the list all day long. Not only are there no drifting race modes or lobbies, but they removed the drift score COUNTER. No longer will drifting earn points or count towards anything at all. You'd think maybe it could count towards car level? No. If you don't race clean then you don't earn much CXP (Car XP). 
The drift score counter has been around since FM3 and honestly I feel stolen from. 
*Note* they still have drift suspension as an option so at least this is a glimmer of hope. 

[h3]2. NO CUSTOM LOBBIES[/h3]
I know this feels like an unrealistic gripe since we haven't had them for so long, but this is such a good feature for game longevity that it honestly would have made up for almost every issue I have with the game. Anything. Drifters would host lobbies and we'd exist in the small hidden corner of the game reaching insane driver levels with the same 5 cars we always drift. 

[h3]3. GAME PACING / CAR LEVELING[/h3]
This is a big one, and in my opinion car leveling was a bad choice, or maybe implemented too aggressively. To be clear about the mechanic, you cannot modify 95% of the car upgrades of a level 1 car. A level 17 car feels maybe 30% unlocked, and I think the highest unlock I saw was level 50. 

I have DOZENS of ""perfect"" (to me) cars in each other Forza game. Forza 3, 4, 5(ehhh), 6, 7. If I were to recreate my garage from any of those games it would take hundreds of hours grinding to level each car. My highest level car is one of the career cars that I don't really ""enjoy"". It is level 17, and took me 3-4 hours of driving to get it there. THIS IS TOO MUCH. I love the idea of being more attached to your cars, but if that's the idea then the career mode should  adapt to whatever car we want to drive. This leads in to my next point.

[h3]4. CAREER MODE FEELS LINEAR[/h3]
The intro cup alone took the entire first session of playing the game for me. I chose a mustang from only three options, and was forced to drive it for 5 races, and 5 ""practice"" laps (yes I now know you can skip these). The career mode doesn't have enough available open cup options to make the game interesting and let you choose your favorite type of car. Instead, it gives you the illusion of choice while forcing you to level cars you don't give a crap about. I have driven 98% of my 7 hours in a newer Mustang, an S2000, and a WRX wagon. None of which I would have chosen to level up. 

Sometimes we just want to build, use the game as a sandbox, and relax.

[h3]5. LACK OF TRACKS[/h3]
I now know TURN 10 decided to focus on modern circuit racing, but dang this game only has 20 tracks and they're just OK. Most are tracks you'll assume are 90% reused assets, while they didn't reuse some you wish they would. It really is missing those flowing tracks like Fujimi and more recently Dubai that my favorite games had. This lack of options further feels like my desires are divorced from the development goals, but I also think that if I were big into circuit racing only I'd still be a little disappointed. 

[h3]6. REUSED ASSETS / CAR MODELS[/h3]
OH BOY as someone who is intimately familiar with these car models and tracks, it's really annoying to see some of them back exactly how they have been for 12 years. The wonky S15, the wheel models, the sunken fitment, the uncentered steering wheels, the stupid adjustable wing and front splitter and TOW HOOKS. 

The one thing I did read about this game before buying was claims of ""a ground up rebuild"". I won't go into the semantics of the words because it wouldn't matter. If it's been rebuilt, then they spent 90% of that development time working on improvements that are not visible. 

Honestly maybe point 6 should be higher. I dunno.

[h3]7. THE GRAPHICS[/h3]
I'm not going to go on a tirade, I'm just going to state that the game runs OK on my mid-tier PC at medium to high auto graphics and DLSS enabled. I get 5-15 FPS in intro scenes, usually 45-50 FPS in races and still doesn't look amazing.
-AMD Ryzen 5 2600
-RTX 3060 16GB
-Samsung M.2 SSD
-16 GB DDR4 Memory

I kinda wish it ran better for how mediocre it looks but I don't really care much. Yes I know I could spend hours perfecting it and get a better result.

[h3]8. PRACTICE MODE[/h3]
I know you can skip practice, but just make it optional for those who don't want to deal with the menus and loading screens. Also, it seemed like the reason for practice was to apply those last minute upgrades and extra unlocks you get for doing practice, but there is no way to go back to ""upgrade"" menu without exiting the race entirely. Stupid. 



[h2]Final thoughts[/h2]
I was going to do a list of pro's too, but really the driving is the only pro. It feels good. At times I feel myself getting really into a race with my level 15 WRX wagon and pulling off a win against maybe slightly improved AI. Does it feel better? I don't know, because I haven't been able to put many different cars to the test. It feels good, but not particularly better than 7 or 6 or 4 or Assetto Corsa right now.

Sure, I've put 7 hours into the game but I don't feel like I enjoyed those 7 hours. I played them faithfully like a huge fan of the series, blindly hoping it was going to get better until I knew it wasn't. I left my second game session with a bunch of pent up opinions that felt strong enough that I had to share them in case other fans of the series are like me.

If I could refund it at 7 hours, I would. Instead I'll just idle and wait to see if things will get better. 

If they do get better I will update my review.

[h2]Author's note from release day - 10/10/2023[/h2]
I still dislike this game. As a big fan of the franchise, I am playing it because I spent $100 on it, the physics are top notch, and I hope they fix it. But those issues I listed above are grating every time I fire it up.

[b]I think if one change should be made, it would be to allow free car customization outside of career mode and online racing.[/b] There are places that CarXP would be great if it weren't the only option! I enjoy it when I get to use a car I [i]like[/i] in career, until that ends and I'm forced to deal with all of the missing features again. This game does not have any longevity, don't buy it unless you see a marked improvement addressing these issues. Or if you love circuit-only racing and being forced to drive cars you don't give a crap about for hours on end. 

Turn 10, please just let us play free play how we want. You can do whatever you want with the rest.

Like most fans I have waited 6 years for this disappointment of a game that even after having all that development time has launched with significantly less content than the predecessors at a significantly higher cost of entry.

The Good
Driving: Ill give credit where credit is due, the core driving experience of this game is actually pretty well done. I've personally had no problem with the driving physics or feel having played this game with both a wheel and a controller, and would actually argue it might have the best feeling of any Forza Motorsport game I have played although it has been a bit since I have played one recently.

The Graphics: as expected the graphics are an improvement over the last Motorsport games, however I know many of people have been suffering from performance problems but I am one of the lucky few does not seem to have been getting said problems

The Bad:
Track selection: The Forza Mototrsport series has been known for mixing iconic real world tracks with extremely unique and interesting hand made fictional tracks. Lots of these fictional tracks have become iconic in the many installments in the series, but regretfully only one of these Iconic tracks has made a comeback and that being Maple Valley(my personal favorite track) They have developed some new hand made tracks which are interesting but we missed out on great tracks such as Bernese Alps, Fujimi Kaido, Prague, Rio, etc. At launch we were only given 20 tracks and a chunk of them are good, but in that selection there are about 4 oval courses which imo you dont need in a game that is not focused on nascar and indy racing, 2 would have sufficed plenty and if the devs wanted to set a hard limit of twenty tracks so that they can release new tracks every so often to keep the player base up I guarantee most of the player base would have preferred Iconic tracks such as the ones I listed previously or even some real tracks such as Hockenheimring, Bathurst, Road Atlanta, or Monza making it in instead of the over abundance of oval tracks, That many Oval Tracks would have been perfectly okay if they launched with more tracks to begin with and their was more variation to start with.

Progression system: The best Progression in a Forza game was Motorsport 4. Everything you got you earned. and it was extremely satisfying to keep playing the game due to how the progression was fairly and evenly spread throughout out. there was always something to work towards, Large quantities of credits where not super easy to get, so every driver level up felt like a milestone as you were given one free car out of a list of a few car types that were similar that would increase in value with every level up, this made it so even though you were not raking in money you could save it for things you wanted and where given a new car around the time you were coming to the end of your fun with the last one. in this game So far I have only gotten credit payouts that have been super underwhelming and payout less than an average race gets you. and then there is the new badly implemented upgrade system which could have had potential if you needed say 10- 20 car levels to get every upgrade, but no they made it 50. What is the point of having 500 cars in a game if you cant fully enjoy each car until you've raced it so much that when you unlock all the upgrades you never want to see it again. at least if it was 10-20 levels you would drive it for a like 10 races level it up all the way upgrade it how you want it, and still be interested enough to drive it  after, but hey just wanted to make it a long tedious grind because they want to keep the people playing the game but are going about it with the wrong mind set. Forza 4 had a mechanic where you had manufacturer affinity where you would drive any car from a manufacturer and it would contribute to your level, as you leveled up that manufacturer you would gain discounts to your upgrades for any car from that manufacturer up to 100%. This was a perfectly implemented system as like I said before lots of money was not super easy to get in that game so you would buy a new car and instead of upgrading it right away you would normally prefer to drive it stock to level up the driver manufacturer first so you could save your money more for the cars rather than the upgrades. This game does have Manufacturer affinity to an extent where you get discounts on the price of cars from the manufacturer but you need to have cars maxed out form that manufacturer to do so which makes it very grindy. Forza Motorsport 6 however you were able to get money cars and upgrades super easily but it was offset by the price of the cars as there was a lot higher priced cars in that game which could drain your millions quite quick just by buying a few, which is an infinitely better solution than what they have attempted here.

No Bots in Private Lobbies: This for me was the biggest slap in the face from the developers and when I figured it out I would have instantly refunded the game had it not been for my mistake of playing more than 2 hours of it. Seriously It is 2023 the devs had 6 years to develop the game and they cant have bots in multiplayer lobbies... A feature that they have had in every Motorsport game since Motorsport 4, and potentially even earlier as I cant attest to the earlier ones I never played. The core reason me an my friends bought this game is to mess around in a lobby together with different car challenges and combinations together with having some competition from bots as they can give us somewhat of a challenge but we can still mess around at the expense of us and the bots not random people online. With just 3 of us on a track it will be pretty empty and non competitive unless everyone is in the exact same car. The decision to not implement the bots in multiplayer completely kills all longevity of the game, as of now on launch day there are only 4,000 people playing, a number which I suspect will drop substantially within the next couple of weeks if the developers don't fix the disappointment of a game they released. A lot of people play this game specifically for the online to go up against random players online which is great, but without bots for private lobbies it makes snowball effect where if people are disappointed in the game which would be rightfully so, the player base will drop which will make lobbies harder and harder to get into has there is less and less people which will dissuade them from playing as well, effectively turning this game into a single player game. If they implemented bots in multiplayer it would allow people like me and my friends to actually enjoy our time with the game, and allow there to be some sort of online experience varying sizes of friend groups even if the player base  collapses and there is no randoms to play online matchmaking with.

Conclusion:
All and all I expected a lot better from this game and am massively disappointed  in the game in its current state. The game had so much potential that was crippled by a string of poor development decisions that were made that alienated long time fans, made it hard for new fans to get into and enjoy the games, and made the game pretty unenjoyable as a whole. That being said their is a salvageable game here as long as the devs listen to their fanbase, and fix their mistakes and short comings before it is to late.

I was hoping to jump into a really high quality racing game as the reveal trailer showed. The PC version in particular is riddled with bugs and glitches such as assets and track failing to load in properly, poor performance on even high end PC's, low quality visuals, motion blur missing in first person view and many other things. The car list is disappointing considering it's called 'Motorsport'.

NASCAR and Indycar is no longer present which is a step down from FM7. None of the tours feature anything orientated around track cars, considering again it's called 'Motorsport'. A lot of other production cars were removed as they were apparently, 'not fitting' even though most of them were fine.

A lot of the game play features introduced simply aren't good. Such as the car levelling system, which if you're a builder, just leads to a lot of grinding just to be able to use desired upgrades for your cars, with some of them being unlocked at ridiculously high levels.

The game does have a few redeeming features, such as the overhauled physics which is much welcome. The loading screens for the tracks look quite nice, as well as the reintroduction of narration, even thought it's fairly limited.

It's pretty fun when get a good lobby but is unplayable because the tracks won't even load and UNLOAD right in-front of you while racing.

Car models are still dogwater.
wet weather racing is fun
Should've introduced a Licence system along with the safety system for better racing.

I will come back when they patch this Bulls**t
but this game is a 4/10 (DogWater status)

2440510,148000686,76561198011928759,0,12,92,0,92,1696972905,"Handling:

There are very few controller options (only deadzones, vibration and automatic steering alignment). Notably missing are all kinds of sensitivity options. You can't disable (or lower) the reduced sensitivity at higher speeds or how the game smoothens the raw input (it does so by a lot, the steering lags behind by a full second if you go from full lock to full lock!). You can't even adjust the general sensitivity, something every casual racing game has (notably also Forza Horizon 5) so this is a big shame for a motorsport focussed game.

As a result of the forced smoothening and low sensitivity at speed, every car I tried feels sluggish and understeery even when using the simulation setting. This even applied to the Ferrari 641 (1990 F1 car), a car that should feel very twitchy and oversteery.

This may be fine for beginners but it's not enjoyable if you know how cars like that feel in other games. I don't expect perfect realism from Forza but at least the driving should be fun.

Visuals & Performance:

Forza Motorsport looks fine but unsharp at times. There are other racing games that are 5+ years old and look at least as good. I don't place the most importance on looks so this would be fine with me if it is because they tried to make the game accessible for more people (with worse hardware). But the performance is terrible for what it delivers. If you don't have a great PC, you will struggle to hit consistent 60+ fps on halfway decent settings.

Bugs and fps cap:

In multiplayer, there is a fps cap of 60-72fps to ""create a level playing field"" which is most likely an excuse for not getting the physics to work consistently at all times. This reminds me of when EA locked the physics of a Need for Speed game to the fps - a rookie mistake even back then.

Apart from that, the game generally feels unfinished with smaller bugs everywhere. I really can't recommend this game to anyone at the moment.",1696979684,1696979684,False,7,2,0.573317468166351318,0,True,False,False

The game is, at its core, great. The physics are excellent, the tracks currently here are good, everything looks good. I can't speak to multiplayer, but others say it's great so listen to them. Car balance is questionable; there's an open wheel racer from Mazda in A class that I can see being a major problem for car diversity in rivals. 

Car leveling is not as bad as I was afraid it would be, definitely worse than it could be though. I don't understand why parts are locked to certain levels. Would've been better to have every part unlocked from the beginning, and just leave car points as the reward for level ups, let players naturally upgrade what they think the car needs. 

Campaign already feels like a slog. I'll admit, I'm still extremely early on in it. But it feels like you're railroaded on what events are opened up, and you don't get a ton of choice in how you progress with what cars you drive. Sure, I can go buy a Shelby Cobra right off the bat. Don't think I'll be able to use it for a couple days though. 

Optimization wise? I have a 4090 for my graphics card, and I was consistently getting sections of the track not loading in until I was driving over a skybox. I figured it was an issue for the game reading textures, bought and installed a SSD, and that ""fixed"" the issue. DLSS doesn't seem to do much, or makes things worse depending on who you ask. Frames don't stutter for me, which is a good thing, but I'm still annoyed with the issues, especially when the in game menu says it's using ~1/4 of my card's VRAM. Disappointing, to say the least.

Look, it's a good game. I like it, I don't regret getting it, if you want to play a fun racing sim/simcade, this is a fine choice.

What we got was a half baked and quite rushed product filled with more issues than requested features.

The game itself has good bones. The physics are very good especially on controller and feel like a proper upgrade over previous forza titles. The cars do feel a tad understeery by nature which can get annoying but you can get used to it. On wheel the experience is a bit worse but still much better than previous Forza titles. I have been running a Moza R9 and found it to be decent after some tuning but there is a decent amount of clipping that I just cannot tune out. 

The career mode is very mid. It feels decent but is very repetitive especially when you're using a bone stock car that hasn't had a chance to get leveled. The AI doesn't feel as improved as they claimed they would be. There are still 1 to 2 cars that run away from all the others at the start and the rest just sorta line up and follow each other. They brake on straights and will dive bomb you without care. Still feels like they needed more time in the oven. (A very reoccurring theme)

The multiplayer is actually REALLY good. Its best described as iRacing lite. The safety rating is a fantastic way to help clean up lobbies and the skill rating is really nice to have balanced races. I haven't spent enough time to really fully review it but I really enjoyed the time I have spent in the multiplayer. It feels A LOT like they focused heavily on the multiplayer and forgot about the career. 

The optimization is HORRID. My rig consists of a 5800x3D and a RTX 2080 on a 3440x1440p monitor. Depending on how the game felt like performing when I hit launch I will get anywhere from 70-90 FPS in one race then 30-50 FPS in the exact same scenario without changing anything. Speaking of changing settings, I have had multiple instances where I would be 2-3 races in with perfectly acceptable framerates then the FPS drops to 30s/40s. I'll check the settings and Nvidia DLSS is gone and it says FSR is on. I do not have an FSR capable card yet the game thinks its running one. It doesn't fix until I restart the game. The menus weren't made for ultrawide so you get black bars on everything besides the actual game play. It feels like they barely optimized the game and it needs 2-3 patches just for optimization. I will say I have been lucky and have had only 1 crash in 13 hours of game play. 

Now we get to the worst part in my opinion... Motorsports. The game is called Forza motorsports yet it lacks so many features that are crucial to motorsports. There is no qualifying in single player, none. Instead you just pick your spot. There is no endurance racing, no multiclass racing, no cautions, safety cars, blue flags for lapped cars, real life race classes like GT3/2/4 and TCR. No tire management.  THERE ISN'T EVEN A SINGLE EVENT IN THE BUILDERS CUP THAT FEATURES A PURE BRED RACE CAR. As a diehard IMSA fan it is embarrassing. 

As a side note I need to rant about... its also quite embarrassing to have the Cadillac LMDh car as the cover star and then omit THREE OF THE FOUR endurance tracks said cover car races in IMSA. Not to mention the lack of legendary tracks like Monza, Fuji, Bathurst and many more. 

Like I said earlier the entire game, besides the mulitplayer, feels like it needed MUCH more time in the oven. Which for a game that was ""built from the ground up"" over the last 6 years is awful and feels like such a slap in the face. I want to love this game, I want a good controller game to go with the incredible stable of sim racing titles we have. Yet, as of now, we have just some bones of a skeleton that Turn 10 has tried to glue together as quickly as they can and at best connected the forearm to the pelvis and the ankle to the ear. (Happy Halloween) Hopefully enough of the outrage will get them to go back to the drawing board and release enough patches to make this game the true king of simcade racers. Besides, isn't that the gameplan for all live service games these days ;)

What can I say, Turn 10 Studios to Forza is like From Software to Elden Ring, for me, this is the GOTY.

Why?

Because, from day 1 this game offers so much content, excelent gameplay, beautiful photo realistict graphics, superb music, accurate sounds, flawless UI experience, a huge library of cars and tons of customizations for them. Worth every cent of the premium edition 

The phisics and controls feels very good (I play with my Xbox series X and Xbox 360 controller), you need 2 or 3 practice races to understand how it works, and man... IT WORKS so good! You have many options to set the difficulty the way you feel most confortable and even you can select the starting position of the race for bonus points.

I don't know, but every Forza that I've played feels the same and at the same time they all have their differences that makes them unique, and this one is no different. Since minute 1 you can tell is a Forza game, is like being home. Of course nothing is perfect, but I haven't seen any bug at the time of this review (10 Hours).

The music in the UI is so relaxing and invites you to check every content and messages. Oh boy those sounds when you have a fender bender or when you floor it, are very detailed, the sounds are like the visuals, the level of detail in this game is very high in every aspect. They did the homework.

Game looks good , feels good. You have good controls on gamepad and  it feels like a Simhybrid on Wheels. 
And YES! i played games like ACC or F1. It feels smooth offline and also online. No connection problems no online lags.
Every Car feels different espeacialy if you drive a subaru allroad and after that a BMW M4 rearwheel.

my only contra is the boring career but in my case i dont care. My focus is on online competitiv modes.

I have a AMD System and absolute no problems with the performance. Dont be Sacred of the bad comments..... its not the first and not the last game wich maybe have a bad start with crashes , bugs and other stuff. 

Dont forget its Micorsoft... they have enough Money and Time to fix all the problems ;)

All in All its better then NFS , The CREW and the other bullshit on the market. In the place between arcade and simracing this game has no rivals. Its the best in his class.

The biggest problem I have with this game so far is the confetti that shoots out of my OEM NSX’s exhaust. And actually, whatever those blurry stripes of lines are, they don’t even originate inside the exhaust at all. I for one enjoy the immersive look of the game from inside the car itself but when I want to watch the replay and see that behind my car is just absurd. It’s like they were too focused on everything else and outsourced the flame design to the devs at Need for Speed. No lighting on the asphalt or anything. Should have just brought back the way it was in FM7.

Second thing that really takes the fun and competition out of OEM spec series racing is manual with clutch. You have to train yourself to shift as slow as possible or you better be prepared for the AI to overtake you in the second lap due to the “wear” and transmission slippage. I understand making the upgrades to the transmission more viable but those upgrades are locked so you can’t change it right away.

Lastly, how have we gone this many games in the franchise without different wheel offsets. Yes, they offered us the overfender kits and the Forza specific vehicles but that’s still them telling us what’s acceptable and there are still a ton of cars with miles of fender spacing… I can’t be the only one who halfway expected that significant change in this reboot!

Anyways, the game feels great and is fun. The graphics need a bit of optimizing but I can overlook some of that, same with the car leveling. The sounds are very well done compared to the others. I just hope Turn 10 listens to their community but I guess only time will tell.

A summary of the good and bad (you can determine which is which):

- Upgraded and enhanced sounds
- White knuckle racing that will put your skills to the test
- Revamped graphics and immersive surroundings
- Not well optimized graphics at ultra (13th gen i7/ RTX 3080 with unplayable stuttering on ultra with only half my VRAM used. Maximum frames for me is 60 on high, not ultra, in career mode.)
- With the above settings the game is playable but the rendering on the cars is unappealing in photo mode or race replays
- New tracks and New car manufacturers
- Same exact modification system as previous Forza games (no revolutionary ways to upgrade cars or performance parts expansion
- No wheel offsets customization
- The preview video on steam shows the ability to pan around your car while selecting parts (including wheels) but I have yet to see such a setting, which forces you to pick a wheel design strictly from the face on point of view. Which I’m my case means buying, exiting to another screen, going back to change the wheel again, back to main screen to look, and then picking another set of wheels, rinse and repeat.
- Car levels is a nice feature but not extremely thought out
Manual with clutch is a headache with oem cars. Which means you will be spending a lot of time with the game on and the AI driving around the track for you so that you can unlock the ability to shift correctly
- Tons of options in the menus (Which includes audio cues for those with vision problems. I think is a very nice feature to include to make the game enjoyable for everyone)
- Exhaust backfire is not realistic by any means
- Car manufacturer menus are difficult to navigate and the whole car list is clumped together. I miss being able to tan from one car company to another and skim down the list to see what that one manufacturer has.
- The ability to adjust starting position to potentially increase rewards is nice
- Gaining credits seems useless since you can’t buy a car and start dumping money into upgrades.
- The above makes is impossible to see what a new car has to offer since you need to level it up first to see any upgradable features. (So if you spent 5 hours or so maxing the S2000 in hopes for a wide body then you just wasted your time I guess)
- The vista and exploring the engine bays of each car is nice though",1696970608,1696970608,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

first of all, get this game on series x if you really want to play it. the pc version does not run well at all. i can barely get it to run well on medium settings with dlss enabled, and my pc is not bad.
second of all, and thisll be a bit harder to fix, is the overall game itself. whoever thought the new progression system for upgrading cars was a good idea is just wrong. i do not want to have to play several hours to unlock all upgrades on ONE CAR. if it was a manufacturer level thing, that wouldve already been better. but having to individually level up each of the ~500 cars (which, the roster is lacking aswell, but i really do not want to get into that right now) is just insane to me. 
the campaign is not all that fun either, youll definitely get the most out of this game in free play or multiplayer.

- Wide selection of cars.
- Amazing handling physics and force feedback, second only to hyper-realistic sims like iRacing and ACC.
- Graphics are stunning, however do require further optimization on PC.
- Car Point system makes you choose your upgrades more carefully, rather than just instantly maxing out a car mindlessly.
- The sense of speed is much more satisfying than many other games I've played. 200mph in this feels like you're actually going that fast.
- Good variety of well designed maps. (No Nordschleife ;-;)
- The UI is very intuitive and easy to navigate, unlike many releases nowadays.
- Really good accessibility settings, just like in FH5.
- A safety rating system for multiplayer so you won't have to deal with idiots diving into you in corners.

Bad:
- Poor graphics optimization for PC, my 4070 struggles to maintain 70 FPS on high settings at 1440p (No I'm not bottlenecked)
- The AI are kinda weird and unpredictable. They can either be insanely hard to beat and act like pro-drivers, or they'll just act stupid and veer off the track randomly. 
- The career mode seems a bit lacking in terms of what cars you can choose from and how the opponents behave. Some Championships only let you pick from 2 or 3 cars.
- The car leveling system is a bit time consuming and takes way too long to get to things such as engine swaps or aerodynamics. There are ways around this (afk farming) but they shouldn't have to be used in the first place.

The career is a shambles, expectations weren't particulary high, but this hasn't even exceeded my lowest expectations. What made Forza great was to buy a car and upgrade and tune it to your liking, with this Forza you will need a couple of hours driving your car before properly being able to upgrade it. Funny thing, you have to do it with every car you buy. This also affects Rivals, which I enjoyed, this is now either enormously time consuming or not relevant to the game at all. And the final complaint, understeer, what's up with that, it's everywhere.

There are some good things ofcourse, personaly I like the overall feel of the game. The tracks that are there are nice.

After years of Horizon releases, I was worried the developers had forgotten where this franchise started. Seeing Motorsport in a Forza title again brought me back to the late 2000's and gave me a small bit of nostalgic dopamine. The sim-cade category of game, in my opinion, has been quite lack-luster for a while now and I hoped that this new entry would bring back the ""golden age"" of this franchise. Seeing old favorites such as Maple Valley, slightly tweaked and brought to a new generation and the addition of new tracks such as the fictional Hakone Circuit has been a delight. The vehicle list is large, and many of the cars have seen the franchise. Seeing vehicles like the 70's Trans-Am racing cars and my personal favorite the Nissan R31 Super Silhouette is a treat. The new handling and tire physics make cars feel grounded like they really carry weight to them and full on racing cars showcase how well aerodynamics and downforce affect handling and corner speed. Overall, this is the best feeling Forza so far.

Now that I've gotten the things I am glad to see in this game out of the way, it's time to get down to the nitty-gritty. By far, this game has the most horrendous optimization I have seen for a AAA studio. With my current set up (Intel i7-8700k @4.8GHz, 32 GB of DDR4 RAM and an Nvidia RTX 3070) running with High overall graphics but all advance graphics set to Auto and DLSS on Performance, I only squeeze out a mere 35-40 FPS while running a race. Turning my graphic settings to Low only yields another 5 FPS max. I understand that this game is releasing for the new Series X but good lord, having a set up that's at its oldest 4 years out of date and has no issue with any other AAA title is ridiculous. The game also likes to crash. I have only 2 hours clocked in the game and have had 3 or 4 full crashes that close the game. Luckily, these have not occurred during races and only in the menus but it is still aggravating. I assumeed there would be a Day-One patch to help with optimization but it has not happened yet.

This game is the definition of “I’m not angry, I’m just disappointed.”

While I do believe they got the driving physics much better this time around, and the online does seem better as well, that’s right where my praise will end. I seriously cannot believe it took 6 years for this half-baked mess. I can barely run it at my native resolution (5120x1440) and get 60fps maxed out with a 13900k and a 6950xt. Excuse me for my ignorance as I am not a game developer and have a lot of respect for these folks, but I can’t imagine a track racer like Motorsport 8 should take up more system resources than Horizon 5, especially when it looks barely half as good. Seriously, I wouldn’t have a lot to complain about performance wise if it looked beautiful like other new titles releasing such as Baldur’s Gate 3, but this doesn’t even come close, and at times I’m not even sure if I’d call it good looking.

I’m not a huge fan of the constant crashing either. It has gotten bad enough that it’s a 50/50 shot if I’ll get through a race or not, with all the practice laps and everything in between. I genuinely would like to keep playing because the game does feel good to play, but at this point I guess I’ll just have to wait till they do some patches. Afterall, why should a product work as intended at launch? Go live service!

As far as the upgrade system goes, I like what they were trying to do, but this sucks. My best suggestion would be to bring down the car level cap from 50 to something like 20 or 30 and make sure that progress is transferred to any car of the same model. If you don’t wanna do that then just go back to using credits or something, it’s not rocket science. Just fix it.

Reader, do yourself a favor and save the hundred dollars you’d spend on the premium edition and go pick up a copy of Forza Motorsport 4 and a used Xbox 360. Not only will it probably be the same price, but you’ll have a better career mode, more tracks, more cars, better music, those great voice-overs from the old top gear crew, and no constant crashing. On top of that, you can invite your car buddies over to set lap times and play split screen, it makes for a great time.

Thanks for teaching me a lesson Forza, I’m finally done pre-ordering games.

The performance is outstanding for some, and quite terrible for others(I'm in this category). I'm not running 4K/3 monitors/Ultra. I use 1440p on a 3080Ti(on the new drivers) and get roughly 40fps no matter what settings I change. This is just going to be a waiting game for the developers to start patching and hopefully optimizing the game.

Onto the gameplay side of things. With 500+ cars and a new unlock to tune system, it's a bit silly. I can see people going straight to a GT3, getting used to it and upgrading it incrementally as a learning experience. But how many people are really going to go through the motions for a less event type car on the current tracks? Sorry Datsun 500, you're just going to be level 1 forever. 

Online was surprising enough that most people played by the rules and didn't intentionally bump into each other. It was a relatively good experience, and probably the games only saving grace since the single player grind is ridiculously boring. 

This is an obvious controller based game, as default settings for various wheels are atrocious. There was no testing and tuning whatsoever on the developers end. If you end up wanting to go from controller to wheel, be prepared for a lot of scouring the internet for settings, and adjusting them accordingly to your liking. Nothing is handed to you in this game. 

Graphically it can look very nice. But don't do any races at ""Noon"", colors are washed, shadows non-existent, reflections disappear, and geometry looks flat. 

The feeling of the drive. This will almost always come down to how you tune, warm up the car, and the conditions and track that you're on. If you're sliding everywhere, then you're not doing something right. Even though it's not a straight-up SIM, it's close enough to where certain things matter.

You probably have read there is not much of a graphical jump from the previous entries. While true it's also unfortunate that the performance is nothing compared to FH5 when it also does not move the needle. I have a 3080ti+12700k and even with DLSS it's  not quite possible to achieve a stabilized FPS which is quite annoying and disappointing for a racing game standard. I have a feeling that lots of this have to do with the implementation of RT. It can be brilliant but at this state it's just bad. 
And, not sure why but I was not able to connect my Dualsense kek. It got bugged out (recognized a controller input was there but I was unable to use my dualsense. KBM also bugged out in which I was unable to use mouse and only operate with keyboard on the menu). Well, back to Xbox controller. Haven't tried Dualsense after official release yet.

I am not the greatest fan of how they handle the career mode either, but hey, it will keep you occupied for a while. And, new car levelling system must be reverted back. Even I am not an tinkering enthusiast I can see why it would be frustrating, despite the said lack of content (the availability of cars). Grinding for each car or sticking to a few is a very crippling outcome for a motorsport game. 

The handling with both keyboard and controller is great. Controller is of course preferred due to its larger feedback. I was never a wheel and pedal guy so don't know about that.
Audio design is once again at its top. 
Most of the tracks are plausible. Despite there is also a lack of them.
Loved the (new) penalty system. Does the rewards coming along with higher difficulties really encourage you? Not really if you have the vip (which I obviously did). But it somewhat encourages you to try them to test your skills. 
Haven't tried multiplayer and online features. Again, I must say the singleplayer part lack strong presentation but it is still inviting and engaging to drive. Always online is not much surprising anymore like it or not.
I am aware of the existence of qualifying session in MP races. I'd also welcome qualifers for the SP part too. Regardless, you are now eligible to choose your own position on the grid for better rewards. Not that satisfying though.

Using a G920 with manual transmission (no clutch since I'm still pretty bad with a wheel)
Drivatar difficulty is between 3 and 5 (cause I'm bad, lul), ABS on, traction control on sport, rest is off.

The first few hours the game actually impressed me. I haven't played FM7 in a long time but the cars (especially the interieur) seemed more detailed. Definitely a step up from FH5 though. Tracks and weather look awesome too. Sadly I can't compare it to GT7 since I don't own a PS5.

Driving feels better than ever (using Simulation steering) and also pretty realistic - though some cars are a bit too ... wonky? Hard to explain, but some cars just feel a bit too heavy, too hard to control but that could just be me not being good at the game. Weather, tire compound, tire wear, etc. have a noticeable impact on handling... or it's a placebo since I've seen some comments say they barely felt a difference.

Instead of buying upgrades with money, you now have to level every car individually. Is this annoying? Yes. Do I mind it? Meeeeh. Kinda like it since you don't just aimlessly buy a lot of cars, max them and then never look at them again. But I have too much freetime - people that can't play multiple hours a day will find this system more than just annoying.

Contentwise my thoughts were: Huh, only the Builders Cup and some featured Series'? Not a lot of content. I first thought it was limited since Premium Preorders got early access but as of right now, that's the only races that you have in your career... which is kinda disappointing. After my almost 60 hours (yes, I have no life) I'm mostly done with all that. Except for Rivals and maybe some Achievements there's not a lot to do for me since (mostly cause of my lack of skill) I don't play Multiplayer a lot. Gave it a try though and so far every lobby was ... actually good. No rammers, no real issues besides two disconnects. Maybe I'll endulge in some more after all. 

To sum it all up: Is it a good game? Yesn't. It has potential to be one of the better Forza Motorsports, despite the few questionable design decisions. But we don't pay triple A games for potential, we buy a finished product. At least that's how it should be. Right now it's a slight disappointment, at least for 70€.

I use only wheel 

Cleaner driving in MP, hardcore rivals ranking no assists and sim steer, you don't have to use cash for buying upgrades so you can use that money to buy the cars, no bugs, I actually had to pit during races because tires were giving out which is a first in Forza for me.

the builders career is kinda boring

The AI is better but still kinda off I tried racing them at their hardest and they're too quick lowered it down to a 3 now they're too slow and in my way but still aggressive. So you have to find that sweet spot in the middle. Which makes sense because in older titles you could walk them but in this when you start dialing in your ability you have to dial them up as well because they will become obstacles that will try and wreck you. I like it but they're still meh to me. 

Right now multiplayer is okay but there isn't enough variety as of 10/10 but they'll be launching more comps and qualified leagues. 

Of course it's not a full fledge sim racer but it does feel very good if you're using a wheel you need to have sim steering on so you can rotate the car with breaks normal steering feels like the rubber isn't on the road and understeers you off into the nether region. 

Rolling starts are difficult with H pattern and shifting in general before you upgrade tranny literally takes two seconds to actually go into gear with clutch. 

Also it would be nice to have on screen telemetry you do have break and gas but  it's a guessing game on when the clutch bites. 

I love Forza so I give this game an 8/10 for now. Once more content, races, leagues, settings come out it would be a 9/10.",1696963028,1696963028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This feels like just insult to old forza fans. (I started with fm3 but have played all forzas)
I refuse to believe they spend more than maybe 1-2 years on this.
Whole game feels like demo or early access for full price game. 
Cant even pretend to understand why they would go for locking upgrades behind car level.
I would even bet they removed most of the cars and tracks just to drip feed/dlc them in to the game later.
Old car models but tracks have to be done again? No semi slicks? No offset for wheels? Why does horizon have better car upgrading/tuning than actual ""motorsport"" game? Hello?

Before i would recommend buying this early access they need to add tracks like: Nurburg, Sebring, Atlanta, Daytona, etc and few fictional ones they had before like Sunset Peninsula, Sedona, Camino Viejo and ofc Fujimi.
Career need to have actual racing car races and more realistic class based racing like GT 3, V8 supercars, multiclass, nascar if they feel need to have ovals etc.

Good:
- Physics
- Free race flexibility and repeatability. I would like the option to pick only full course setups though, instead of continuously getting shortened versions. 

Bad:
- Lack of high-level content. Seems like the devs are planning on multiplayer carrying end-game, as theres very very limited career races in which you can actually use Class S or Class R cars. Its fun to use an old Golf Mk I every now and then, but I dont want every race to be 2 laps in Class D cars, which still take 20 minutes to complete. 
- Lack of weekly content. There needs to be something, anything, other than buying and leveling up cars to keep players interested and to keep them coming back.
- Lack of ways to earn cars. This also goes to the lack of weekly content; I dont want to have to buy EVERY SINGLE CAR I want to use more than once (renting). Even more so when a majority of the high level cars, which, again, you cant use in career races, are 300k credits or more. I think we can all agree Its fun getting reward cars!
-Settings dont seem to hold after closing the game. It reads a button on my wheel as both ""accept"" and ""look straight back"". I have to change it every time I launch the game. 

Really Bad:
- UI is very clunky. Definitely seems like it was designed around console. Theres no ability to search cars by name in any menu (really?!?). Cant even enter a specific number for PI when creating a free race, you have to scroll from 1 - 999. The garage menu is probably the worst I can remember in a Forza game. The car bay shows the car you have in there, but not the car youre currently ""using"".
- NO ABILITY TO SELECT MONITOR!! Thats just unacceptable in a driving sim game these days. Need to use a third party program to get it to output on the monitor in front of my wheel, which is not my primary monitor. For some reason Shift+Win+Arrow doesnt work for this game.
- Graphics are very very rough. Big step back from the last Forza games. Cars are drab and ""smudgey"" even in the garage. Theres a TON of visual glitches and hitches especially with images in the sky (flag towers, helicopters, etc). Road surfaces are full of spots and dots, probably from where the different panels of road ""connect"".

CONS:
- PC performance (crashes, unstable FPS - Medium/High settings, RT off)
- Wheel support
- Ultrawide support
- Price

DETAILS:
So I once again pre-ordered game and believing in Forza brand (After Horizon 4 & 5), I got premium edition, expecting decent base game with content being eventually added. The first time I booted the game up, crashes and < 30 FPS on default settings.

After first couple of races and PC restart, the game started to perform better but the cutscenes are still laggy at times no matter what settings, I even tried low and still drop below 30 FPS, come on Turn 10...

Default wheel settings are a mess, took me ages to figure out I have to invert FFB and find the right tweaks so it's playable. Bit disappointing. At this point with laggy game and unplayable wheel I was ready to refund but it was too late, 5 hours in, troubleshooting, tweaking settings etc.

There are other annoyances such as no proper ultrawide support, UI is squashed, menus and cutscenes cropped. Something weird is up with the rear mirrors, UI feels weird to navigate on wheel and keyboard (clearly designed for controller). 

I like the progression system personally, keeps me from jumping from car to car and makes me actually learn to drive different machines. I don't bother with tuning or upgrades since I'm more on casual side and don't understand any of that - I'm glad this game was designed with this on mind that not everyone is an expert but the options are there if you are.

With multiplayer locked for 60FPS  - I don't see an issue at the moment SINCE I DON'T EVEN HAVE STABLE 60 ANYWAY.

I know they will fix all of that and it will become a great game after some time and I knew it will happen so I didn't expect super polished game but it unfortunately fell way below my expectations, especially after spending so much.

CONCLUSION:
If you haven't bought yet, I recommend keeping an eye on development of this game and pick it up after updates, when reviews improve. For now stick with Assetto Corsa which you can grab for couple of £ and have unlimited possibilities with mods.

Overall it feels unfinished but at it's core, the driving is enjoyable and challenging, AI sometimes acts drunk but not the worst, multiplayer seems to work well and has potential, performance will be fixed and more content added over time.",1696959435,1696959435,False,1,0,0.486486494541168213,0,True,False,False

Clearly, it is trying to fill the niche of GT7 on PC/xbox as a simcade. That's what I am most excited about - using triple screens on gt7-like simcade. So I am mostly comparing this to GT7.

Let me address some complaints that people have:
-""You have to grind for cars before you use them online"": I see that as a benefit and i suspect that it was added with the intention to address the issue with meta in GT7. In gt7, whenever you are in lobby, what you will see is everyone driving the exact same car, because that car is best on that given track. It won't be so easy to pick the meta car if you have to grind it a little bit first. So i am actually happy for that.
-""Graphics are not 2023"": don't use the auto-adjustment - it makes horrible judgements. Go into benchmark and play around with settings. Raytracing is indeed not great, but the graphics are definitely superior to gt7 once you get them right, make sure to adjust the gamma & hdr lightning. *running relatively high-end pc myself, 3080ti & raptorlake.
-""The wheels don't work"": idk what u mean guys, my wheel is actually deprecated (no longer produced by manufacturer) and it works amazingly and i am happy with the ffb - fanatec CSW 2.5. The default settings were not great, but if you ever tried any simulator ever you would know that the default settings always suck. Refer to youtube. My only problem with ffb is that in many tracks curbs produce no feedback.
-""crashes"" - never happened to me over 24 hours of gameplay

And my own points:

-I didn't try the online yet. I have a serious concern that the skill & safety ranking needs a rework, since you can be an absolute rammer in rank S.
-Speaking of ramming - I do not understand why did they not add a radar. You can't hope for people to not ram without giving them a radar. There arrows, but they are not very intuitive or helpful.
-The tiny visual details of cars are not as good as gt7. 
-The career is better than gt7, imo. 
-The tuning & upgrade systems are mostly on-par with gt7, in some cases better and more detailed.
-The AI is mostly okay, but occasionally can behave frustratingly dumb, to the point of braking on a slight bend right in front of your face flying full speed.

Let's dive into the whirlwind that is ""Forza Motorsport"" and see if it's worth the pit stop or if it's more like a crash-and-burn situation.

First off, the game's performance has been quite the rollercoaster for some, with crashes and graphics resembling something out of your grandma's old flip phone.  But fear not, intrepid racers, for I, your humble reviewer, had just one hiccup at the starting line. A little tweak here, a nip and tuck there on my OS and the game purred like a kitten on a racetrack.

Now, let's talk hardware. I'm still rocking a trusty 2080 and a processor that's as budget-friendly as a dollar store shopping spree. So, I didn't quite crank the graphics settings to 'eye-popping,' but you know what? The game ran smoother than butter on a hot skillet, and I couldn't help but revel in the joy of it all. 

Truth be told, I hadn't graced the tracks of a Forza Motorsport game since the heady days of ""#5."" But this new installment had me daydreaming about splurging on a fancy sim wheel and diving headfirst into a whirlwind of four-wheeled fun. 

Now, let's hit the pros and cons like a racecar hitting that perfect apex:

Pros: 
A garage packed to the brim with more cars than your dream dealership.
Upgrades and tuning options that'll make your inner gearhead giggle with glee.
Customization galore to ensure your ride is as unique as your thumbprint.
The chance to conquer iconic tracks that've seen legends of the motorsport world.

Cons: 
The AI in career races sometimes thinks it's in a demolition derby rather than a respectable race, giving 'rubbing is racing' a whole new meaning.
A few bumps in the road with frame drops during high-speed showdowns.
Graphics optimization that could use a bit of a pep talk to perform at its best.
So, there you have it, fellow racers and armchair drivers. ""Forza Motorsport"" might have its quirks, but if you're willing to tinker and tame the beast, it's a lap well worth taking. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!",1696957077,1696957077,True,0,0,0.480871379375457764,0,True,False,False

The positives;
The overall feel is much better than previous titles, I am using a G920 setup and it feels a lot smoother than FM7, although tweeking is needed for setup as base setup for wheel and peddles is not well optimised.
The cars sound GREAT, it really is a step up
The tracks for the most part are much improved, with exception to a couple of little bits
Tyre selection for race tyres is a much needed addition, using just race tyres in the wet in previous games just felt odd, now having to use actual rain tyres makes sense.
Race cars feel a lot better to use, touring cars specifically didn't feel good in previous titles now they feel closer to the real thing, have drive a Golf BTCC car before I felt comfortable in this game pushing the TCR's with no practice.

The negatives;
This game wasn't ready for release and it shows, it needed another couple of months in the oven.
Let's address the elephant in the room. ""Built from the ground up"" what a lie, and we fell for it. So much the same, only little improvements, less tracks, hardly any new updated cars, especially race cars and the worst part, the AI can use cars that aren't even released yet, meaning as already reported, Turn10 are holding back content. No surprise there.
Penalty system needs a lot more work, you can get hit through no fault of your own and you get a penalty.
AI is actually worse than the Drivertars, and i don't think many people thought that possible.
The single player is not up to scarcth, and to be honest this has been the case for a while, the last full campaign was Motorsport 4, we really need something like that again.
Where are the modern race cars? Okay so we got a few new additions to the TCR and BTCC cars but also plenty missing! There is no excuse not to have a fully lobby of cars from the following series;
Class 1 DTM
Super GT
BTCC,
TCR UK, WTCR etc.
IMSA Sportscar Championship
WEC
European Le Mans
Michilin Pilot Sport
NLS
GTWC and so on.

Finally the last major issue is the polishing of the game, parts look great and then you look at some of the decals on the cars, or the billboards, or even the number tower at Le Mans and it looks worse than a SEGA Saturn game (Okay showing my age there but still)

I have no doubt this could be a good game, but in all honesty like most AAA games Turn10 missed the ball here. I have no doubt Turn10 like motorsport, but they sure don't undertsand it well.",1696956737,1696956737,False,4,0,0.524348795413970947,0,True,False,False

-Cars feel great using a gamepad, they react has you'd expect a real car to
-The graphics are quite good, looks like a prettier FM7 at medium graphics with a bit more aliasing. So at max graphics it must look awesome.
-Career mode is quite good

Cons:
-IT HAS TO BE INSTALLED ON AN SSD IF YOU WANT AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE
-For now, the game is unstable in the menus and cutscenes; lots of stutter and bad frame rates in menus/scenes (but it's quite smooth when you're driving)
-Not has many interresting cars/tracks has in the other FMs (but it should get better, right?)
-We should be able to skip practice laps in career mode

Verdict:
It's good to have a new Forza Motorsport. The cars feel great, the game looks good and it runs pretty good when you're ACTUALLY DRIVING. However, the game needs polishing, it lacks content (like the Nordschleife) and it has to be installed on at least a SATA SSD to be enjoyable. 

I don't regret bying it, it runs decently on my computer and the game should get better over time, knowing that Microsoft was trying to make Forza more of a racing platform than a game.

I love Forza and love the games they made and how accessible they have been to car people and non car people alike. This is not a negative nor positive review but something i write out of love for the franchise and my want for it to succeed. I will be complaining about my dislikes a lot but it's what I feel at this moment after playing and I want so badly to feel differently soon about it.

The Cars:
I do enjoy driving numerous and very detailed and lifelike cars these games never fail to provide and having the (relative) freedom to mod them how you want and then do it all again with another for hours and hours of building, testing tuning and making them your own. However, this game has taken away those freedoms. The new CP system and car levels has turned a game with such great potential to be a really good Arcade-Sim into a monotonous grind. The only way to get all the upgrades is to drive and race for 2-3 hours per car to max out the Car Level and spend your CP on upgrades. The kicker to this is once you max out the car level and you have your car dialed you may want to buy another and build it a different way for a different type of race style. You do this and that new identical stock car starts back at Car level 1 and if you want to you have to grind all over again. There is the save feature of the tune I know but it still seems ridiculous to ""master"" a car you have already ""mastered."" Overall a step backwards I feel compared to previous titles.

Driving:
The feel of the cars really depends on your settings. I play on a controller and this may be very very different on a wheel setup. My main are ABS On, No TCS or Stability Control and normal steering Manual transmission. The main base level cars feel fumbly and heavy. The under-steer is atrocious on all platforms FWD, RWD and AWD and I have yet to find a counter to this in tuning or settings when the vehicle is in stock form. The GT 3 and Le Mans cars feel snappy and have some front initial bite but if you even think about going to power through the apex of a corner while still having any steering input it may as well be null. You're going to go near straight on the line you have started to power onto. There is a lot of reward to figuring it out and stringing together a great line and powering through and gaining tenths but these feel few and far between yet still very earned. It's not a great feeling driving the cars but they at least feel consistent in their efforts to make them all feel just not great. The contact physics are still sticky. I have been trying to make moves on the inside and had light contact only for the AI to keep turning into me and I'm unable to turn out from their magnetic front fenders and spun and race ruined. Just take your L and finish near last. (Sure you can rewind but that's lame.)

Racing:
Once you start to want to play. You have the single player career mode , The Builders Cap. The main premise is to start slow, upgrade and as you get to learn the car you upgrade to get faster and get to really being one with your car. The idea is excellent and sounds like a blast to play. Until you get into the game play loop they have devised for you. You start the race weekend with 5-6 minutes, 3 laps, of practice then do another 6-7 minute race. Seems simple but you have no goals other than an optional lap time goal in practice. No reward except some knowledge of the track which may help in the beginning. But there are only 20 tracks to race on in the game. Many are real tracks that have been in other titles before. So if you are a racing game enjoyer you will recognize them once on track. Seems like a super redundant and time extending for little reason. Now that you are more knowledgeable than the track creators you get into the race. in the race you can pick your position and difficulty and this gives you more reward for higher finishing position. The start is the worst. The AI starts in 2 single file lines into turn 1 and you can usually gain 3-4 positions off the rip. This leads you into the real race where you go against the inconsistent AI with no real road presence. If you fight them enough they back off or they will not even notice you exist and sit on the racing line while you go around. Maybe they have some sort of learning capabilities but I have yet to experience this in game after 4 hours of racing. Given the AI drivatars have never been the best this feels unpolished and unrewarding.

Optimization:
I have a decent PC with some solid specs. AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and NVIDIA 3060ti, no overclock or anything crazy and I cannot for the life of me get this game to both look good and perform well. It's either 45fps with ok graphics or 55 with clay models. I cannot find a happy medium anywhere with the graphics. I am able to run Horizon 5 with everything set to high / ultra at around 70-80 fps no problem. There is no reason a game that has this much of a budget to be running this poorly on an above recommended spec PC. I've been sacrificing looks on a Forza title game which have always been ahead of their time in the graphical department to play a game that has very little to give back on the driving end of things.

There are many things I am not a fan of already and maybe this is all just a skill issue and I will have a different opinion as I continue to dump hours into the game in the future. 

There are so many minor things keeping this game from being a top fighter in the series rankings up next to FM4 and the Horizon's 1 and 3. I'm still holding out hope that some things will be changed and looking forward to seeing others opinions on this game as well. I'm loving it and learning it and would recommend it still but with hesitance.

Pros: 
Driving is fun and immersive
Customization with Paint and Vinyls is as wild as your imagination
Game is Beautiful (when everything loads due to optimization issues)
Sound is high quality
AI challenge adjustment is very customizable
Tuning
Decent Variety of cars

CONS:
Unoptimized so much that unless you're NASA, chances are you're gonna have stutters and lag and loading playdough.
Random off-brand cars but missing some key big name players (IE Chrysler 300, JZX90 etc...)
NO AI IN MULITPLAYER (WTF Turn 10, its 2023. Just sad)
Pretty minimal track selection when you look back at previous titles and competitors
No Drift specific tracks (Tuning and parts for drifting but no REAL tracks for drifting)
Car leveling is cool, but it's too slow and annoying at times. I dont want to RACE for 3-6 hours in my 300zx before I have enough points to stretch into a drift car.
In Car Camera placement in some cars needs work (RHD cars with a roll cage basically lose all sight on the right hand side of the car, so hitting apex' corners is a guessing game on new tracks or with someone on your side.

Personally I wasn't expecting the game to be so demanding on my computer for the slight edge in graphics it has compared to games like FH5, and The Crew Motorfest. I can play games like RDR2, Jedi Survivor, and MW2 on max graphics with 60+fps but here I am playing FM and bleachers and billboards are vanishing into thin air right in front of me because it's overloading my GPU. 

Beyond the performance issues, the biggest problem I have with the game so far is, where on earth did all the game modes and features from Horizon 5 and FM7 go? No drift tires? No drag or drift related game modes? Not even any open-track-day meetup game modes that were loved by so many in FM7. Tons of cars missing (Presumably going to be milked and only return in the form of DLC).

The good news: it's Forza

The bad news: It's still just Forza.

The ugly news: The progression system is ""artificial."" Car level, while in retrospect makes you work to make your car better and better, is a complete 180 from the freedom of tuning to insanity in the previous Forza Motorsports games. 

Overall, I don't hate this game. But I won't be recommending this game. Especially with all that AAA gimmicks such as losing progression after a race or two, save game corruption, graphical glitches,  the deadzone settings on gamepads are way off. 

The only good thing that I can pick up from the game is that they are at least trying to be Gran Turismo in PC. That's about it.

However if you are just looking for a fun sim-cade racing game to play on a gamepad, it's pretty great. The car selection is pretty decent, certainly far beyond what we get in sim games, but is lacking compared to previous Forza Motorsport and Gran Turismo games. However the track selection is extremely basic compared to most other racing games in all sub genres, plus some scans like Spa are already years out of date.

However there are two areas I feel I'm really let down.

Our first pitstop? Oh, just the main menu, where the cars, embracing a “love thy neighbor” ethos, were attempting to engineer next-gen Mini Coopers through some rather... zealous overlapping. Now, why, pray tell, is this metallic mating dance stamped with ""ESRB Everyone""? Aha! A sly move to ensure our kiddos get a turbocharged introduction to the birds and the bees, or in this case, the BMWs and the Bentleys, if you will.

Fasten your seatbelts and pop on those shades, because our next stop on this glitchy gambol through ""Forza Motorsport"" invites you to a dazzling light show masquerading as, well, your average game environment! Imagine steering through real life, only to be bathed in a perplexing disco of frenzied flashing, courtesy of our friendly neighbourhood skyboxes, locked in a chaotic celestial tango up there. With a majestic 30 fps at even the lowest of graphic settings, the performance doesn’t just languish, it packs up, buys a cocktail, and lounges by the digital poolside. A word to the seizure-prone: you may want to sit this one out. Not unless you fancy a firsthand glimpse into an involuntary neurological rave, stirred lovingly by multilayered skyboxes that appear hell-bent on laser-beaming their angst directly into your pupils!

Next pitstop: CTRL+C, CTRL+V Ville, a quaint little town in ""Forza Motorsport""! Buckle in, for here you shall find a stunning array of vintage, untouched vehicles straight from the archives of Forza Horizon 5. The developers, bless their economically-minded hearts, deemed it unnecessary to bother with those pesky updates Horizon had polished over the last half-decade. Photo mode? Pfft, who needs a crisp shot when blurry memories do just fine? Rear wheel steering, wheel spacers, and acoustically dynamic exhaust upgrades? Pshaw, such modern nuances merely clutter the classical charm! Let's not forget the ephemeral drift tires, seen only in the trailer, making them essentially automotive unicorns within the actual game. And whilst drag tires grace us with their presence, they, like us, still eagerly await the advent of a drag racing event.

Choo choo... wait, what? Oh, it's Forza Motorsport and not the midnight express from Train Sim World? My bad, but can you blame me? Both seem to take us on the scenic route to monotony junction. Ever get that itch to do something so tedious, so repetitive that it makes watching paint dry seem thrilling? Bingo! Enter Forza's all-new ""Deja Vu Drive-athon"", where you can relive your rookie days again... and again... and guess what, AGAIN! Some car perks unlock when you're practically in the virtual retirement home, while others are so easy to get you’d think they were handing them out at a kindergarten graduation. And the irony? A game that's all about car customization apparently believes we all secretly yearn to drive the automotive equivalent of plain white toast. Go ahead, take another lap around boredom boulevard. Maybe by lap 432, that custom exhaust will finally unlock.

Ah, the penalty system: A Kafkaesque dreamscape where the innocent are punished and the mischievous roam free, an inverse utopia for digital motorists in Forza Motorsport. Picture this: you, a conscientious driver, delicately navigating the asphalt, only to be rammed by a rogue player and, voilà, you’re the one penalized! It's akin to being fined for having your lunch stolen. Now, introducing the driver safety rating – a commendable notion swiftly being transformed into an autopilot paradise, where players gleefully exploit every driving assist available, effectively turning their racing experience into a self-driving jaunt through circuitry and code. The car? It levels up, safely cocooned in the embrace of automation, while our cheeky driver might as well be sipping a mojito poolside, utterly detached from the pixelated roadways.

In the wild savannahs of digital racetracks, we observe the rare ""Artificially Ineptus Driverus."" Unlike their counterparts in nature, these creatures show a peculiar tendency to dive headfirst off the track, perhaps chasing the mirage of a digital ice cream van. When in a group, they move with the elegance and speed of a sloth in slow-motion, yet curiously, given a clear path, they metamorphose into cheetahs, leaving all behind in a cloud of dust. Most fascinatingly, these beings have the mystical ability to summon vehicles from the digital ether—ones curiously absent from the game's showroom. One might theorize that these spectral cars, while finished, are being held in a digital limbo, awaiting their moment of DLC glory.

Ah, Forza Motorsport, the game that took 500 of its vehicular stars, said ""you can’t sit with us,"" and sent them packing, with a lofty promise of cleansing the list from silly and mismatched models. ""Goodbye, non-fitting SUVs and off-roaders,"" they proclaimed, while sneakily sidelining perfectly sensible cars with not a backward glance. But worry not, for in this automobile purgatory, there’s a high chance our departed four-wheeled friends might be reincarnated, only to be generously offered back to us as “brand-new” free DLCs. A round of applause for such benevolence! And let’s not overlook the paid car pass, diligently ensuring that your dollar fetches you the least amount of metal on wheels possible, setting a new low in the glittering history of Forza.

Ah, the classic bait and switch! ""Forza Motorsport"" tantalizingly dazzled us with trailers featuring spectacular, next-gen graphics, only to unveil a release version that feels like it took a detour through the early 2000s. And oh, the lighting! It’s as if someone handed the sun a cocktail and asked it to illuminate scenes with the stability of a tipsy twinkle light. Picture this: a car's interior that showcases a bewildering light show, perplexingly deciding which bits to highlight and which to shroud in cryptic shadows. It's not so much an immersive racing experience as it is a mystifying jaunt through a world where logical luminosity took a back seat, giggling, leaving us to squint, ponder, and crash into the scenic surroundings.

One would presuppose a modicum of intuitive design wherein a restart option is readily available, yet herein lies an enigma: shrouded amidst the ‘quit’ submenu it resides, a decision most bewildering! The elusiveness of the 'skip practice' button too, a Gordian Knot, causing consternation amongst many a digital driver. Moreover, permit me to elucidate another curiosity: this vehicular simulation, alas, cannot endure an internet disconnect, rendering one's virtual wheels tragically immobile in the absence of cyberspace connectivity. Furthermore, gentlefolk, we stumble upon a numerical conundrum, wherein car weights masquerade in pounds yet, aha! They are naught but kilograms in disguise! And lo, the fiscal dimension of this digital domain also perplexes, for verily the vehicular acquisitions and their subsequent augmentations are of such trivial fiscal concern that one’s virtual coffers burgeon unfettered.",1696946403,1696946403,False,2,3,0.430541753768920898,1,True,False,False

Good things:
- sound design is excellent, whoever did this made an excellent job
- excellent number of cars (around 500), you cannot drive formulas from day 1, have to earn it, so it is great ... some say there could be even more car and I am sure they are coming
- you can be competitive with controller. no need for wheel
- with raytracing looks really really fine, some models at night look like made out of plastic but it will get fixed I think
- fun to drive but not so complicated, between Forza Horizon and ACC
- Japanese director is managing the game

Neutral things:
- 20 tracks and many look similar - for example no interesting tracks like YAC Marina or Monza, but we will get new ones - also hope more fantasy tracks are coming too
- number of SP events could be better, now it's like 100 races total compared to FM 7 around 350, but already 5 new races are added via regular update and we see that 15 more races are coming to FM by the end of the month, so I expect the number will catch up and maybe surpass FM7
- RPG thing where you need to drive a car a lot before you get level 50 which enables all upgrades - fine s far, but for every car in the game it is 3-4 hours griding per car x 500 cars = 1500-2000 hours in total, and that's if you drive only to complete grind; maybe could be speeded up with some accolades/forzathon rewards, see below
- no auction house and everything about acquiring and upgrading cars is different, I'm not sure I like it, I'm not sure I don't like, we'll see
- forced practice run of 3 laps on SP - maybe bad in the long run when you already know every track very well, could be made optional afer level XY maybe 
- some people complain about crashes, I had zero, Intel i7+RTX2060, maybe try playing on recommended settings? I don't push my system where it can't go!

Bad things:
- one AI car always speed up from the rest, at higher levels you must be Nikki Lauda to catch it so I am always 2nd, not fair
- AI in general could be made better, maybe with GPT or something
- more variety in single player, I miss special events or Forzathon/accolades from FH5... and make creative missions like ""finish 5-8 but at Silverstone in rain with AI competition set to high and with some drive assists on, some off"" or ""make 2nd part of the track lap in under x minutes x seconds"" or ""use this Japanese car on this Japanese circuit with maximum 5 off-track events"" or similar, at the moment it is if not downright boring than maybe bland",1696945140,1696945140,True,1,0,0.499479323625564575,0,True,False,False

I've never tried motorsport series, so this feels like something new and fun for me after they gave us dull and empty map in horizon 5. After reading some of the reviews from previous motorsport players, i can see why they feel disappointed. 

Pros:
For horizon player some adjustment are necessary for sure, you'll need to adapt with new physics and car mechanic. Worry not, they provide good corrections input for controller player, so the adaptability for horizon player wouldn't take much time. You'll find smooth control even with a gamepad controller. The first 2 hours impression for me is great. Car physics sure is an improvement from horizon, though this game physics never correlate with horizon. The new steering wheel animation is truly a blessing, even if we don't get a full 360 degrees steering at least we are not stuck in a 90 degrees animation anymore.

Cons:
The car leveling system need to be revised, why can't we just level up for the class of the race instead of individual car. We also like to drive different car without the hassle of grinding for the same series. Also it takes a lot of grind to actually level up your car, it reminds me of free to play mobile racing game. Wide variety of cars, but no dedicated touring race car, I mean Real Racing 3 got a lot more car choices for different class of racing, even the latest motorsport events, mind you this is a free to play racing games on phone. I can't seem to find GT4, GT3  or other endurance car in the same season, as these are the series that i look up into for a game called motorsport. It all got mixed up with different year and season, making it looks like a rich people car racing event not actual motorsport event. For example you got the 2017 Aston Martin GT3 and the Bentley Continental GT3 from 2014 racing each other.

Conclusion:
At this point I don't even know if I would recommend this game or not. If you are a horizon player and looking for something new or a place to escape from dull horizon 5 desert, you'll find this game amusing since it's control is friendly toward newcomers. If you are a hardcore sim racing type person, just get other racing game out there. If you still insist on getting this game, just wait for sale.",1696944715,1696944715,True,1,2,0,0,True,False,False

The grind is honestly quite balanced, unless you want to max out every single car which I doubt anyone ever would do in the first place. The economy overall is excellent - cars aren’t too expensive and you get plenty of funds from playing. 

Driving physics as others pointed out are best you can get on PC that is not pure sim. 

Multiplayer’s penalty system is bread and butter and works extremely well. If you are steering away from car you are about to have contact with, the game will interpret it as trying to avoid accident therefore no penalty given. It really punishes rammers and those that try to put you off track on purpose. 

The performance is solid but if you want the game to look best, use ray tracing, which is demanding on the system, but worth playing at 60fps (as opposed to 100fps which I can achieve but with no rt). 

Some tracks look jaw-droppingly good like Spa - the amount of trees and LOD distance there is insane. The most detailed and exciting Spa I’ve ever played. 

What I wish they add - ability to move camera inside of the cockpit. It really sours the experience on a wheel if you can’t adjust it and align perfectly to your sim rig.",1696944485,1696944485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What to say about this game? Its a more serious approuch rather than the arcady Horizon (soo much fun too) and its a great game that fans will love and play for years to come. not the best launch but i hope they fix everything and keep addint stuff to the game, the foundation is perfect.

Pros:
+ Clean, simple and beautiful menus
+ Great detail in cars and tracks
+ Great phisics
+ Pretty good wven with gamepad (i won 2 in 3 races with gamepad)
+ Soo much potential for future updates (cars, tracks, etc)

Cons:
- Some textures take a bit to load (not installed on SSD)
- In the launch day we couldnt play on Steam Deck (hope they fix it)
- Need some optimization (at least the PC version)

First up, let’s talk positives: the visual department is stellar. The ray tracing on PC paints each scene beautifully, and those cars? Detailed to the bolt, making it evident that the artists were at the top of their game. The sound design deserves a shout-out too; cars sound authentic and truly immerse you in the driving experience.

Now, on the gameplay side, the physics overhaul is fantastic. Handling feels much more responsive and nuanced, especially when playing with a controller. The driving experience is, without a doubt, a high point of this game.

But it's not all sunshine and revved engines. After a six-year hiatus, there were some high expectations. At times, the game's visuals can feel slightly cartoonish, a bit of a contrast from the otherwise hyper-realistic feel. Customization is where I felt a sting. Tow hooks and a basic spoiler? That’s surface-level for a game of this caliber. We loved features like launch control in Horizon 5; their absence here is puzzling. And devs, a small plea: Horizon 5 recognized that some of us metric system users cherish HP over KW. Can we get that back, please?

All said and done, Forza Motorsport does deliver in many areas, and I'll undeniably clock in countless hours. However, it’s a tad disappointing. Honestly, it doesn't quite align with what I had envisioned. Browsing through online discussions, it appears I’m not alone in this sentiment. For a game in development for six years, it surprisingly lacks groundbreaking features or noteworthy additions. We were all gearing up for a title that was meant to define next-gen racing, but it seems to fall short in that regard. It doesn't truly feel like the culmination of a six-year development cycle.

Good driving physics, and the rewind option is a good feature to let you learn the game.
Good driving AI.

Mixed:
Abs and TC should be car, class, or event dependent. Framming it as an “assist” ignore the fact that some of these cars are equipped with it from factory. Should be a part you can install and tune, not a menu option.

The Bad:
Career mode is shallow: No progression, slow to super cars too fast, then slow to super again.

Most of the events are locked, so you need to compete in event that you don’t want to compete now to advance. It should be unlocked in a class manner: like you unlock 4 slow events, then 4-middle class, the super cars etc. So you can play then in the order you want.

The driveatars naming convention breaks immersion: Instead of “FasterMonster22” it should be “N. Thompson” or something that recall real name like that.
Most races have 24 cars, and in a short race they block you (because Ai suffer in the first 300 meters) and let the first and second disappear. three lap races should have less cars in the grid.
“Choose you grid position” is a joke when they somewhat force you to qualify. This broke career immersion. You need to qualify to get ahead of the middle pack, that will clog the road in the first 300 meters. But because you can choose the position you like; somewhat undermines career mode. 
You can skip practice, but the option is hiding somewhere in the race menu. 

500 cars, where you need 4 hours per car to attain maximum level, and if you buy the same car again, you need to level it up again. So, the Car point system is mindless grind. It should be manufacturer dependent, not vehicle dependent.

Your cars are by default underpowered in career mode, so you need to grind it up. But some parts of the car are unreasonably high level. Breaks immersion because you are forced to upgrade it in a certain order. Then you need to “abandon” the car because you can’t use it in the next event, so when you finish career mode you will have 23 cars at level 17-20.  

Its strange, because the kind force you to make career decisions, like to race multiple seasons of a cup to build a competitive car, but do it in a way that don’t relate to real motorsport, career mode is not you playing motorsport like events, is playing a series of “bad gaming designers cup”.  


Conclusion:

In the end: They are restrictive where they should not be (car building, events choosing), and compromising where they should not be (choosing grid options, jumping to supercars and back). They should learn with FM4.

FFB and default settings:
The default settings isn't the best settings for wheel users (using Logi pro wheel).
Steering axis deadzone was 1 by default for no reasons, also gas and brake had deadzone by default.
The dynamic damper behavior (not to confuse with gyro effect in ACC) was on 100 by default.

Gameplay:
In a championship you keep upgrading the car where your opponents do the same. 
The AI on maximum level is okay but sometimes do crashes into your side door.

Tracks LITERALLY DISAPPEAR mid-race and leave you racing in the void for the remainder of the event, FPS cuts exactly in half at random and requires you to pause/unpause to fix, replay system typically has cars flying in midair. Headlights often don't appear in cutscenes/replays. The rear view mirror is a completely different low-quality world that's often missing assets like trees and grandstands. Menus don't stretch to 21:9 screens.

The racing wheel support is a joke, when that should be a focus of a sim racing game. Enabling the clutch causes a neutral drop every rolling start/every shift that's a bit too quick, and isn't actually needed at all to shift. The wheel settings are all sorts of whacked out by default and require you to watch a Youtube tutorial to get within reason. 

There's no Auction House. You can't adjust the camera position in cockpit view. You can't change race length in career mode (every single race is a sub 10 minute sprint that requires no tire changes/refueling). Nordschliefe (which is in basically every Motorsport game) is also missing, only has the GP circuit.

A lot of the car models/liveries are re-used from prior games, complete with low poly models and pixelated liveries. Rims/wheels turn into a static picture at a certain speed, it's very obvious and looks silly. The black paint color isn't actually black, it's dark grey.

There's also strange balancing issues, like opponents upgrading their cars between races and forcing you to upgrade after every round to have any chance at all of winning, not starting with wet tires if it's raining, and penalties not always removing if you re-wind to avoid them.

I had high hopes for the new Forza Motorsport game, but it has been nothing short of a disappointment. As a GeForce user with an RTX 2080 Ti, I expected a smooth and visually stunning racing experience, but what I got was far from it.

First and foremost, the optimization for GeForce users is abysmal. The game struggles to run on my powerful hardware, with constant frame rate fluctuations that make it impossible to enjoy the game consistently. I've encountered numerous crashes that have left me frustrated and questioning the quality of this release.

The graphics are a mess. Missing textures, poor distance graphics quality, and pop-ins are all too common. It's disheartening to see a game in 2023 with such glaring graphical issues. I expected a visual masterpiece, but instead, I got a game that looks like it's from a decade ago.

It's clear that this game was not properly tested or optimized for GeForce users, and it's a shame because Forza Motorsport has a strong reputation in the racing game genre. I hope the developers address these issues promptly because, as it stands, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially those with Nvidia GPUs.

i have played the past 5-7 forza games and loved them. but FM has really nailed making each car feel distinct and fun. in FH5 (for me) the game play made we want to: buy car, upgrade car with everything i can to make it as fast as possible, try car out in race, it doesnt do well against other actually fast cars, determine car is not very good and then not use it again.
with my time in FM so far i have honestly enjoyed the C and B class cars the most so far. making minor upgrades to squueze small performance gains out of the car has been really satisfying. they also changed how cars feel and now driving 100 mph feels fast instead of feeling like i'm barely even moving.

Forza Motorsport for me really bridges that gap between crazy automotive arcade antics of Horizon and the ultra realistic simulation of something like Assetto Corsa. It reminds me a lot of the Project Cars series which I sunk quite a few hours into some years ago. 

The cars handle and feel like you'd expect, I've seen some reviews complain that they behave unrealistically and refer to it as 'understeer simulator' but that's pretty true to life, most road cars at least modern ones tend to understeer if you steam into a corner too fast or try to accelerate out of it too early, can't comment on race car handling as obviously haven't driven one. The cars do feel different though, an M3, 911 S and a GTi all handle like you'd expect though which is nice, and also they sound like you'd expect too. Gameplay wise it's great, I'm enjoying it a lot, I find the AI a little stupid during the first few corners of every race but apart from that they race/drive all ok and fairly. The career mode has been a fun way to experience different cars and learn the tracks with cars of very different paces and handling characteristics. The vehicle uprgading progression system has caught a lot of flak due to it's lack of freedom and some upgrade not available until you level up the car, I haven't yet had any problem with this. I quite like the car points system, I can build my car with whatever points I've got differently for each race, maybe this race I know it's a power circuit so I just need as much horsepower as possible and another circuit it's all about handling so I want to strip out the weight and put the best tyres I can on it, it adds another element of challenge to the game.

The graphics look great, they can look a little washed out when the in game sunlight is glaring right at you, and I do find night driving a little too dark, like the headlights don't have the range I expect but it's a minor gripe and if anything adds to the excitement of trying to remember a track. Also in general sounds great too, I am using a well spaced surround sound 5.1 system and you can hear what each wheel is doing and where the other players are around you very clearly, even the tracks have good soundscape too. Speaking of the tracks, they're very well created, the real life tracks are faithfully recreated and the ones invented by this series are also great. Yes it is a shame that the Nordschleife, wasn't available at launch but there's plenty of other tracks to keep me entertained until it is released, plus we've got Yas Marina next month coming which will be great.

I've also seem a lot of complaints about lack of optimisation, I think it runs fine, it is a next-gen game and some driver updates in future and other patches might give us a little extra performance but on my 7900X3D and RTX4090 system is runs very well, 4k native DLAA with everything ultra gives around 85-110fps depending on track, weather conditions and other cars on screen. I did actually get a little bump in FPS (5 or so) when I updated the BIOS on my motherboard so other AMD users may find it helpful to do that also. I've seen some users complaining of issues and then turns out they're trying to play this game on a hard drive, you absolutely need an SSD for this game.

I haven't played multiplayer so can't comment too deeply on the locked to 60fps issue, but that does seem very stupid. At least give people the option, I am quite sure most people on xbox or slower pc hardware would check a box that says allow me to play against players with higher fps, this isn't that much of a serious game. 

The only gripes I noted during my 20 hours so far is that I can't choose what units of measurement I want for my horsepower/torque/speed etc, it's only imperial or metric. I want horsepower and newton meters and kph. The AI as i mentioned has kamikaze mentality at the first corners. It was an expensive game but I hope the future content makes up for it.

Graffics are pretty good. To drive is better that previous editions.
The down fall TNH is the game play, the sheer need to grind to upgrade your cars is a stupid joke.
The amount of cars is solid although most seem like rehash brought over from 7.
in fact outside the driving much of the game is the same as before, photo mode , replays , paint and design all the same since Forza 4ish.
Tracks look good, wet weather is more visual than real, grip is just dialed back not dynamic in any way.

It has evolved, but its the same kind of flawed product it was before, because the competition raised the bar, so even if it trumps forza 7 it is still a generalist product with pretty distinctive faults. They dont have the nerve to take the GT7 approach and limit the car offer for proper HD standards, some cars interior arent readable even beyond 100% resolution scale. Obviously not ground up work. Bar some annoying repeated crahes on menus its in playable state.

HOW IT DRIVES: Fine, does the trick on wheels after you tinker with settings enough, but as far as i know most kerbs arent being FFBed for now, at least for me. It has the simplist approach of giving you a ""speed bonus"" when you run through a corner at the proper speed, little more washes out your steering even if you can trick a little speed in if you careful oversteer a tiny bit. If you turn off every assistance, it fails to reward. Also it is time to let go braking bonus for not using abs, i dont use TC even in asetto competizione, but there is no point here, even abs assistance visibly locks wheels its awkward. Manual clutch is so badly done its crazy. Wet track grip is decent but forget about water puddles, doesnt matter where you step is the same.
Also your wheel will work 180 degrees each side, so for developer it was always arcade side of the spectrum with some sim touches.

HOW DOES IT SOUND: Nice! most exhaust sounds are solid, the sound register has ample stage, bass and reverb are strong but not overdone (tunnel reverb grossly overdone). Full clutch driving misses some dynamics, little shallow across the range i would say. Still most cars compete or exceed GT7 from outside, while inside sounds lacks proper cabin feel. Tyre roar, air displaced arent modeled properly i think people in charge have game mentality and arent true car enthusiasts.

HOW DOES IT LOOK: Looks good, but a mixed bag, sometimes it hits the right lighting and you feel a true next gen feeling, but pixels are too fat so it loses sharpness rapidly with distance, looks like console focus, nice to watch from afar on tv, but simracers tend to have big monitors up close. Raytracing is a dud imho, glitchy, costly and doesnt pay off, i went cubemap and and with the extra performance i set resolution scale at 150, will check with next amd focused drivers and game patches to see if it gets better. A huge mistake is that you cant use raytraced ambient occlusion without rt reflections, i care more for accurate shading and occlusion more than reflections. It should be separated. And its 2023, no tyre flex?, some cars have backfaces unchecked so you can see through wheel reflections. Textures arent what they sold on trailers.

HOW IS AI: Lucky here, it is very compelling, makes some mistakes but feels they invested on it, when you dial your difficulty you can manage the right challenge, simply feels right, sadly the physics betray small side contacts with stickiness, hope they fix that issue. Somewhat sluggish in packs and pretty fast alone so it could leave you behind if you start from the back.

There are quite a lot of stuff thats annoying the car grind is a big mistake, content inflation for the same mods from forza/horizon, only ballast is pretty cool addition.

There is effectively no multiplayer. There is effectively no rival racing. Why do I say that even if the features clearly exist in the game?

The reason is the car level system. If I want to do rivals on certain level or participate in multiplayer I must first race each and every car I might want to try around a track for about 2-3 hours to be able to actually tune them. This means the usual Forza process of try different cars and tune them might as well not exist, at least for me.

I went as far as grinded the levels on one car by just letting it autopilot around. But after that I just did not feel like playing anymore. Because I knew if it was not the best car for that track I'd need to let the computer to run 3 hours again just to try a second one.

Great improvement in physics. Better than Motorsport 7 obviously.

Is it good? Yes, very, but with some caveats. 

The physics and driving model are excellent, hugely more nuanced than FH5 and FM7. With simsteering even on a controller you know what is going on. I think the best compliment I can give is that it is just fun and enjoyable to drive in this game. 
The changes to multiplayer are top tier imo. The safety and driver system works. The practice, qualifying and racing is an excellent step in the right direction. The racing is now superb for the most part. Yes, we have lost the various hoppers where you can jump into a race. Personally, I don't really care that it is gone. It always ended up being bumper cars regardless. 

I enjoy the car progression system, especially from a career aspect. You start out with a bone stock car, and at the end of the 5-6 race championship, you can potentially end up with a very nicely tuned and competitive vehicle that you can use for other things. Outside of the career mode, the progression system is pretty bad and needs some major work. There are also some design decisions which are just a bit annoying and some of the good improvements that FH5 made are not present such as wheel spacers being a big one. Oh, and the menu lighting needs a lot of work because at the moment it is baaad. 

Still, this game is solid and enjoyable, and I have no doubt it will continue to improve as QoL and other updates come through.

so the negative first:

Ignore optimization or online only(which is a automatic refund), this game is super boring, one of the most boring games I have played, I can only describe that with a few words: everything is boring and sleep inducing. it feels like some cheap bad knock off PC3, and I hate pc3, that game is garbage, but this somehow feels like a cheap knock off version of PC3.

Further more the AI is a clear copy and paste of FM7, the AI doesn't see anything and at all costs sticks to their pre designed path even if that ends up in them smashing into other AI or you, some of the worst AI I have seen in years honestly as even early 2000s AI is far better.

The penalty system is also completely broken as avoiding a collision with AI always leads to punishment but just smashing into them when they swerve back on track never leads to one.... online isn't much better as getting rammed is not allowed but ramming is good according to the penalty system.

Now how boring and bad the gameplay is aside.

It doesnt run well on any currently existing hardware or next gen hardware ( unless a 5090 will be a 400-500% uplift over a 4090). cpu wise it seems to only use 3 cores and 3 threads, which is to be expected from forza as they all struggle to use even 1 core at times, 4 on a good day, nor do those cores seem to be used very much. your gpu will get destroyed, no matter which one you have or at what resolution you play, and all of this will easily being the worst looking forza game in over a decade. fh3 on pc easily looks better, even on console that game looks far better somehow.

Further more, regarding the looks I would like to say these car models look terrible, they don't even get remotely close to  even GT7 ( which  doesn't have that good of car models itself), and that's console vs PC. they all seem to be very low effort and have barely functional interiors which is very disappointing. and I know I should compare it to old games, but drive club had fully functional interiors, that was a PS4 launch title, so how hard can it be to do that now?! not to mention those car models look far better than anything this game could ever hope to muster up, even on a 9090ti super at 40K.

and as mentioned before without a connection to Microsoft servers you cant play this game at all. only some terrible arcade mode that lets you drive any stock car in the game, not even your own and you cant make any progression in it. and considering how bad Microsoft servers are to begin with, and how short they have kept servers for games like FH2 up ( it has been down for years in terms of actually working, it only worked for a few years after release), and how bad the current ones are. FH4 still is barely playable for many of my friends online and that game is pretty old now, FH5 still often has many issues, and I don't see this game being any different. So this is a automatic refund for me considering offline you can not do anything

So based upon just the online only and optimization you should refund or not buy it, most of you wont be able to play anyways even on the lowest settings at 800*600 with fsr turned on, even then you wont get 30 fps.
But then you also have issues with the game play being some of the worst I have seen in any racing game, its so boring and there is nothing to explore or do really, unlike in older games like FM1,2,3,4 or GT1,2,3,4.

The positive is that the game doesnt need to restart to change settings, and they seem to finally not ban people any more for using msi afterburner while playing their game like they did with FH5.

Overall I think a rating of about a 2.5/10 is fair. it does kinda work and inst all bad, but the most important things all suck and basically no one can play this game anyways as it doesn't even run well on a 4090, and no it is not time to upgrade from a 4090, it is time to put some effort in your game...",1696922584,1696925363,False,5,1,0.511462509632110596,0,True,False,False

Things I like:
 - Tracks are not as many as older titles on release but all of the available tracks feel great.
 - Changing Visibility, Weather/Track conditions are IMO really good. As the developers said: ""No 2 Laps will 
    feel the same"" and I think they did a good Job on that.
 - Car selection/variety is good.
 - Although the car progression system as a whole has a lot of problems, I like the fact that you can only 
    bring small upgrades to your car between races when playing career. It enhances the feeling that this is a 
    real championship where you can't just make your car better in ever possible way in just a matter of 1-2 
    weeks between races.
 - Wheel support feels good but could be better.
 - Racing against the AI can sometimes be a lot of fun. Sometimes.. We will get to that later.

Things I do not like:
 - Money is absolutely meaningless. I played for 10 Hours and got more money then I could ever spend.
 - Car handling feels kinda off. Sometimes the car will just break grip without any FF indication whatsoever.
 - Grinding 10 Races with one single car just to unlock weight reduction modifications is just awful.
 - No career races for actual racecars.
 - You unlock power upgrades mostly before weight/tire/aero upgrades. So it feels like you are always forced 
    to make power builds with your car if you don't want to grind 2 hours just to unlock a spoiler.
 - Dreaded Forza Aero
 - AI Drivers sometimes have no spacial awareness at all.
 - I know that the Forza Developers said that they wanted the AI to make mistakes whiles racing to make 
   them feel more real. In theory this sounds good IMO but in practice the AI just drives off the track  
   randomly or crashes in a seemingly impossible way.
 - Some menu options like ""Restart practice/race"" or ""Skip practice"" are hidden in the menu behind the exit 
   button. (You need to click on exit and then you get the option to exit, restart or skip)
 - Lighting inside the cockpit is kinda bad in some cars.
 - Still some reused outdated car models.
 - Sometimes the AI Drivers grid consists of 15 Nikita Mazepins and 1 Max Verstappen on steroids.
 - When you finally overtake that one Verstappen he kinda starts to reevaluate his life choices and just gives 
    up and falls behind in the middle of the Mazepins.
 - Many people report frequent crashes and performance issues but that never happend to me personally. 
    Still want to let you know about that.
 - Always online sucks. Why do i need to be online when playing single player?

To summarize it up:
 I don't think the game is that bad but it seems somehow unfinished/untested for how long it was in the 
 making. The developers could definitely turn this around. Fix the AI, the car progression system, the UI 
 menus the lighting, further improve the wheel support, add more racing career events and the game would 
 be pretty solid. But as of now I would not recommend this game if you have other similar racing games to 
 play.

This time it seems that there's more RPG in your car game, as in, it's expected for you to level up your car so you can get better upgrades for it. Instead of having a huge selection of cars right from the start, Forza Motorsport wants to aim for the car-love aspect of owning one vehicle and sticking to it for a bit, leveling it up, making it better, faster, more responsive and get the win that way. 

Do not expect the car collection vibe from Forza Horizon or other games in the genre. It's not meant for you to hoard cars at 0km, brand new, in your garage right from the start but instead, you have to earn them by doing what you probably will love more in this game, racing. At first I was not sure the grind would be a good way to go up for bigger and faster races but it grows on you, specially if you have the RPG itch from other genres and like the idea of leveling up without making sacrifices to your (real) wallet. Your XP earned will be based on how good you are pushing you car to make the best time possible, to make the best corner possible, so while earning XP you are also mastering your car of choice and learning how it reacts on different tracks and corners. You will haven a visual note of how good was your cornering, going from a 1 to 10 scale and it feels good for you to see that you are improving a certain segment in practice mode from the second to the third lap for instance. It's up to you if you will enjoy this mechanic in a car game. One thing I'm divided however is the lenght of the practice runs VS the actual race. Sure, it's good and important to practice but is it really a good balance having a 3 lap practice sessions for a... 5 lap race? It seems that they tried to get the sim enthusiast player with practice runs and also the casual player with smaller lap races. This leads to an experience that may not truly make the game fully enjoyable for the hardcore and casual player at the same time since it's really hard to try to please both of these two distinct players. I also was not expecting the game to be so much quiet. During the races there's no in-game music but one car enthusiast can argue that the best music is the turbo going ""stu stu stu stu"" and I have to agree on that. What I would love was to have your team member giving you some race stats, tips to be more agressive or to hold a position. Instead it's just silence with the occasional ""3 laps to go!"".

Speaking of frustrating game design choices, you may have noticed that, in some games, no matter the cup or championship you are in, you will always start last. While it's a fair design choice for some games, this method will tire you as you go on. It feels good to start from the very last position and work your way up but I never forget the most important aspect of playing games: having fun. With Forza Motorsport there's good news as you can challenge the grid which means putting you in the sweet spot when it comes to how easy or hard you want the game to be for you. From changing game rules, putting the AI with, say, less driving skills it makes the game more suited for your style. And remember, it's okay to play on easy, fun factor should always be king when enjoying your games. I found that the AI is still a bit of hit and miss. I've been some AI really trying to avoid crashing in you and staying on their side but on the other hand I've experience some really agressives one in parts where no agression was actually needed. Visuals, reflections and natural effects are nicely done and it's more noticeable when you try different times of the day or different weather conditions. Night racing is tight, while racing in the rain really makes you feel that your car is struggling to keep all wheels from spinning. On the other hand I feel reflections needs more polishing. It's more noticeable on your review mirror when looking at the cars you're racing against and also on the main menu when it comes to shadows and reflections. It's far from game breaking and I'm sure it will leave most players satisfied enough.

As a game featuring lives services it's expected for the game to grow not only in cars and tracks but also, hopefully in modes. Unfortunately drift events are not available day one but one can hope they are added. This does not mean you can't drift or make your car more drift oriented for you to try different cornerings for instance, it just means that, as a stand alone drift mode you are left with no choice on day one. If we can use older Forza Motorsport titles to make a fair comparision about the lenght of the single player portion then I would love to have the time and fun combo from Forza Motorsport 4. It had such a great meaty list but also some fun activities.

Regarding performance and visual/sound issues so far I found one glitch during a practice race. I started to see a portion of the road turning pitch black, then some reflections on the scenery and last, all the game scenario went into a glitch fest where every surface on the lower part of the car would either be gone or turned black or was having random reflections of the game itself. As soon as the practice race ended the glitch was gone, it didn't need a restart of the game. Performance however, while I'm still getting some decent 60 FPS or 120 FPS the variation of these FPS is all over the place. At first I thought it was due more demanding races, with many cars and heavy rain but I'm noticing severe frame drops on the main menu after a race, by changing the menus in the main menu and by changing different car views (cockpit from chase, etc.) While not game breaking for me I really want a consistent in-game FPS experience. I want steady 60 FPS or steady 120 FPS and I want to be able to choose this assuming my hardware will be a match for it. The same applies for playing online and not getting a limit on my own FPS. Not sure if I have seen any other competitive online game pushing this idea. Here's hoping they improve the FPS going all over the place on busy scenarios but also on the simple or less demanding ones like the menus. For some, these issues would be an instant refund or negative review but I have to be fair and take all the good into consideration as well. Yet, I felt these issues should not be present on the game at release. We are talking about one of the biggest racing games on the market with a huge history of success across different generations. People grew playing Forza games for years and we, as fans and folks buying the game day one with all the content available as well should not spend their time scrolling through different websites to find a solution for their performance issues. 

In the end, it feels the game while solid, it has a lot of potential. It seems that while the game communication is focused on simulation it provides quite a lot of more arcadey options for those only looking for the casual side or track racing. While fair, this may lead to a bit of identity crisis of the franchise as it's hard to strike both the sim and arcade worlds in one game. The good news is, they will be very welcoming. Even if you are not a veteran player and just a casual player you will feel good because the game is not punishing you too hard and you will feel a very honest sense of progression. Hopefully it will be a game with even more options regarding graphical options and a wider variety of supported monitors such ultrawides. There's a lot of room and hopefully it will be a game to play for a decent amount of time in the next years assuming it will also be supported by the devs in the long run.

Races in Story mode dont have the option to be longer.

- The audio is quite good

- No drag racing
- No drift events
- No car bowling
- No playground type events like tag or infected
- No test track
- No auction house
- Mediocre level up rewards
- The photo mode is considerably worse than in FH5
- The menus/UI often feels clunky
- The AI is very slow when anyone else is around, but is very fast when on their own. Also, if you put the AI in a very high car class and set them on the hardest difficulty, they will likely cause at least 2 pile ups per lap.
- The upgrade system feels entirely unnecessary. Let me do what I want to my cars. They’re mine. Restricting player freedom is hardly ever a good choice, and this is no exception.
- Missing a lot of tracks compared to the previous motorsport games (Bathurst, Sonoma, Long Beach, Daytona, Sebring, the list goes on)
- Missing a lot of cars that were in previous games (Lamborghini Murcielago, Cadillac limo, Bugatti Veyron, NASCARs, Indycars, and there are exactly 0 trucks/SUVs)
- The values of the cars that are in the game have absolutely no basis in reality. A Koenigsegg Jesko is $450K, a Bugatti Divo is $418K, a 2018 BMW M5 is $179K, a Ferrari 250 GTO is $160K, and a 1995 Corvette is $105K. These prices make no sense whatsoever.
- There is no end goal. In FH games the goals are clearly laid out. In FM7 you tried to work your way up and win the final trophy at the end, and there was also the whole car collection thing. In this, it just feels like you’re doing championships for the sake of doing championships.

The answer is no. But it's still a great game. :)

Definitely the best game in the Forza family. I might tend to prefer a tiny bit less arcade-y approach, but the arcade/simulation ratio still keeps you entertained while not being a mindless ""pedal to the metal"" racing game. I'd say it's halfway between Gran Turismo 7 and Forza Horizon 5.

Huge selection of cars with beautifully recorded sounds is a delight, the upgrades and tuning system make a lot of sense and keep you coming back for more racing and the tracks are an eye candy.

If you made me name the cons I've found while playing it, I'd say there should be more substantial penalties for crashing into other cars, the sound of the cars doing so would definitely deserve an improvement and I'd like to see the 60FPS-cap in multiplayer gone for good, since it's just annoying for people who tend to race online regularly.
Other than that, it's hard to criticise this game.
I've heard stories about the game not running well on some computers, but I've kept steady 90+ FPS on my 10600K with 32 GB RAM and a 3070 on high details, so it's hard for me to complain.

Many people tent to compare it to Gran Turismo 7, but in my opinion those two games differ more than one might think at the first glance. While Gran Turismo is a bit more serious, more enjoyable while driving with a racing wheel attached and best enjoyed from the ""behind the wheel"" perspective, it takes some concentration and energy to play it, the new Forza Motorsport is a relaxed experience for a lazy day, while enjoying a ride in your favourite car, viewing it from behind or enjoying the speed from the bumper view, all in the comfort of a comfy chair and best played on a controller for maximal comfort. :)

Where should we begin? Perhaps the tiny library of cars available at launch that'll definitely increase over time in the form of paid add-on dlc? Or perhaps the mediocre customization available?

Perhaps the abysmal PC optimization that will even leave the affluent 4090 owners wanting more? Maybe it's the audio, or lack there-of, literally no options for music at all?

This means you can't progress career or multiplayer as the freezing issue occurs in both. 

This is a game breaking bug that has essentially bricked Forza Motorsport for me. Turn 10 completely ignored the issue which was the largest post on their bug report forums for the entirety of the early access week. They only took notice when it was finally reported on by a media outlet. It is unacceptable that a regularly occurring bug of this severity was not caught in testing and somehow made it to release. Customers paid an extra $30AUD for early access to an unplayable game.

Not to mention, the game performs awfully on PC even on high end systems. 

It is obvious Forza Motorsport has been rushed, has had minimal testing and was still months or years away from being a complete functioning game.

It did happen often enough that I took a break from multiplayer and focused more on single player until the issues are fixed.

Is this game worth buying? If you are a Forza Motorsport fan and want the latest game with various improvements and new cars I would say go for it. However, if you are not sure or you have never played a Forza game before I would recommend trying to find one of the earlier Forza Motorsport games like Forza Motorsport 7 and trying that if you can find it at a cheap price because it has not changed much.

_______________________________________________
I grew up playing Forza Motorsports 4. That was my go-to game, and quite frankly, one of my favorite games of all time. Expectations were high coming into this. I am not a huge fan of the Horizon franchise and wanted something more grounded when it came to building race cars. I love the idea of building a car from the ground up to create a machine with your own personal touch to it. Forza is about building and driving those cars. One major flaw to this game is that it takes FOREVER to grind out your car to get it to level 50, and then even then you still have to gain CP to buy each upgrade. Getting to the level simply UNLOCKS the parts, the CP is what is used to purchase the parts. 

For a game that focuses around building cars to enter into championships, this is AGONIZINGLY slow. 

Have one currency throughout the game that should be applied to everything. Simple as that. This game is far from what Forza Motorsports 4 was, and it's sad to see that it barely grazes the surface of what that game was. 

PROS:
- Graphics Look absolutely stunning
- Car Models are wonderful to look at
- Weather Model is fantastic, as well as the the time progression feature
- Driving and Grip feel great

CONS: 
- Poor Damage Models and Damage Physics
- Terrible AI Racers
- Very Slow Progression
- Sound Design that falls flat

I'd recommend picking this game up on SALE, and with the expectation that the progression gets adjusted as well as more content added.",1696919537,1696919684,False,4,0,0.501625120639801025,0,True,False,False

Making the review after playing the pre-release Premium Version for 35 hours.

The Good:

Forza Motorsport has the most realistic and consistent gamepad handling on PC money can buy right now.
The driving experience is sublime with highly adjustable difficulty, suitable for newcomers and veterans alike.
Multiplayer is solid and ""Rivals"" is amazing. Time trial leaderboards now allow you to copy tunes from leaders then try to match their pace.

The Bad:

The curated career is shallow. Some of the cars you can chose from for each event are  underpowered, which is problematic with the current leveling system. Considering the wide range of cars available in the game, there are no dedicated Touring Car, GT3 or Endurance type of races, based on real life Motorsport events.

The car leveling system is extremely slow, considering the number of available cars. 3-5 hours per car to be more precise. This needs to be reduced significantly as it now resembles a free to play mobile game levels of grind. On top of that the order of the unlocks leaves many cars with useless upgrades in the early levels (more power to muscle cars but no handling upgrades for the first levels?)

The Ugly:

The current version of the game is poorly optimized, leaving majority of PC users struggling to get smooth gameplay experience. Many of the graphics settings simply don't work. On my 6800XT I couldn't get FSR to work. I couldn't even switch resolution from 1440p to 1080p. Changing settings requires restarts. On each restart the game recompiles shaders for 5 minutes. I've had about 20-30 crashes in 35 hours and 2 BSOD.

To pour salt in to the wound, the jump in visual fidelity compared to FH4&5 and even FM7 and Project Cars 2 from 6 years ago is arguable, considering that playing with Ray Tracing ""on"" at the moment seems to be reserved only for top of the line PC users.

But if your a longtime forza fan like me, I think you will love the new car progression system. It livens up the progression system and makes it feel fresh. In multiplayer most hoppers use homoligated cars so you dont have to worry about grinding to be competitive. There is currently only 2 hoppers where you have to build and upgrade cars within a certain class.

I will say though, that it is pretty lame that they are capping the framerate in multiplayer to 60fps. The game supports multi monitor and ultrawide screens, that is also technically a performance advantage too so the justification that they provided is lame. Id disable crossplay in an INSTANT if it unlocked my framerate in multiplayer.

 It definitely is a modern AAA game 'live service' where the overall content in the game feels a bit empty so it gives them a update path for future content drops. But i think what is in the game is really fun. I love the featured car multiplayer lobbies where they feature a new car every week and you have to drive it to level it up and upgrade it through the week.

- Multiplayer: This is where Turn 10 has put what seems like 90% of their effort into improving from the pile of mess that is the Forza Motorsport 7 hoppers. And man, what a difference that made. Special shoutout to spec events and their take on skill-based matchmaking with both driver and safety rating. Stuff like OP cars in spec events and a somewhat inconsistent penalty system (very strict with track limits but inconsistent with collisions) still needs to be addressed, but there is a lot of potential for these events to be bangers. In terms of open events though, there is a serious issue with car PI balancing I will explain a bit more in the bad section. Suggestion to address the open events balancing issues would be to introduce extra rules like power-to-weight ratio restrictions.
- Sound: MAJOR improvement from Forza Motorsport 7, although compared to Forza Horizon 5 it is a bit of a mix. I think most race cars have much improved sound, some surprisingly sounded like the GT7 versions. Music is also much better than Forza Motorsport 7.
- Dynamic time and weather: Building upon where they left off at Forza Motorsport 7, Forza Horizon 5 etc, this is a much needed feature that I am glad to see implemented in better detail. The game tends to look better at night, for some reason. Rain effects look awesome too but I am a bit surprised there is no puddles  anymore. Would appreciate weather radar though.
- Controller support: Typical Forza, amazing with controller. Feels largely similar to Forza Horizon 5 though surprisingly.
- Physics: Again, feels like Forza Horizon 5? Which is strange, given that game is supposed to be more arcade-like, but by no means does that mean I don't enjoy the physics. You can ride most kerbs with a lot more confidence now compared to in Forza Motorsport 7. There are some ""sausage kerbs"" that will screw you over if you ride them though.
- Cockpit views: Thank you for the FOV options. End. Oh, and good to see some improvement with the steering wheel animation finally, now that we can turn 360 degree total instead of 180 total. 

Bad aspects:
- The fact that this game is live service: There are clearly stuff that they have ready like a few GT cars, Formula Drift cars etc, that are withheld for monthly updates. This game is using live-service model as excuse to hold back stuff that have been in previous games (look at stuff like 935, CLK-GTR from Horizon, as well as tracks like Mount Panorama, Brands Hatch, Daytona etc.)
- CaRPG: The grind to get enough car parts for upgrades on each car gets very tedious. I do kind of like the idea of having to work to upgrade the car. but instead of locking parts behind levels, Turn 10 could have made it so that all parts are available at the start and you just need to earn Car Points to obtain the parts.  Also, it would be better to have each manufacturer share a pool of Car Points so that you can share upgrades between cars of the same manufacturer and also get discount on upgrades.
- Forza Aero: It is ancient relic at this point and the fact that it still exists is astonishing. Hope whoever responsible can find more aftermarket options to add into the game asap.
- Old car models from Xbox 360 and OG Xbox: There are still many cars with old car models that carry over inaccuracies. These are well documented for many years on Forza forums and with a ""reboot"" title I expect more effort put into fixing these models than what I have seen so far.
- Single player career: Does it want to be serious in the sim aspect or be arcadey? It seems to not have its mind made up in terms of which direction it wants to go. A lot more option should have been available to customize the experience if they wanted to cater to both style, like having options to adjust the race weekend structure so that you can either do the same thing as in older Forza or have a full race weekend structure. 
- Car division, car class and PI: Some car divisions are obviously improved like the current IMSA GTP being its own division, early prototypes being separated into two groups (Group C and Early LMP). On the other hand some divisions make no sense at all. [b] What is the Essenza SCV12 doing in Forza GT fighting with GT3, GTE, GT4 (?!) and V8 Supercars? [/b] Open class lobby is funny because 70s F1 cars get to be much better than other cars in R class. 
- Paint mode, Photo mode, Replay mode: Listed these three in the same point of complaint, since they all have the issue of lacking QOL improvements after years of using the same system. Start by introducing the QOL from Horizon 5
- Proximity radar: Nitpicky, but I would appreciate having a proper proximity radar of other cars instead of the current proximity arrow.
- Adjustable TCS and ABS: Again nitpick but Gran Turismo 7 has different levels of TCS and ABS you can adjust in race, so why can't that be the case here as well?
- Server issues: I have had multiple disconnections in online races at around GMT+11 9pm-11pm throughout all 5 days of early access. Also I sometimes have lag spikes in race and on occasions I would lag into another car and causing a collision to be flagged. Can Forza please improve the server infrastructure?
- Bugs: The list of bug noted by the support team and online videos is large, and it is disappointing that the 6 year of development time still managed to leave so many bugs in existence right now. Improvement is needed fast, and Turn 10 needs to have a more well-polished game in future. 
- PC optimization: Major issue for the PC release of this game. Again, look at the long list of PC/Steam version bugs documented on your own support website Turn 10! This also needs to be addressed asap. Yes it is playable right now, but not near optimally for me.

Final words:
Obviously there are aspects that I have not touched on in this review, either because I can't (I don't have wheel right now, also Steam character limit!) or because I forgot. After all, there are way too many stuff I wanted to say about this game so I am bound to miss out on something. I really want to give this game a chance. There really is potential for a solid platform for online racing because the groundwork there is done quite well, and this is about as good Forza online racing gets. Unfortunately the same can't be said for the rest of the game, and it is quite saddening to see 6 years of development not leading to the major leap that Turn 10 promised. Some major strive will be needed to make this game recommendable to other players if they are to pay full price, and I need to see that happen to have faith in Turn 10's post launch support. If you are a Game Pass player and can get the base game for free though by all means go for it, particularly for those that like car racing in general. It is surprisingly easy to get up to speed if you are somewhat good at Forza Horizon 5.

However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.
 
The performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.

So overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",1696910748,1696910748,False,603,18,0.890656888484954834,0,True,False,False
