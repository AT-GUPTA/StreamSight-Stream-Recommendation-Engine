It’s a synergy that works amazingly together, and the amount of content up for grabs here is insane; 3 massive games with a large assortment of DLC, there's 80-100 hours of content if you do everything, and provides enough combat and dialogue variety to be well worth a replay.

If you’re already familiar with the trilogy, be aware, there's nothing revolutionary here. The first game has received a number of tweaks to reduce some of the clunkier mechanics, as well as both a graphical and UI overhaul, but it really stops there, with the ethier games feeling near identical to their original counterparts. The smaller tweaks to the series are certainly appreciable, but for a definitive full priced re-release, it certainly feels like more effort could’ve been put in.

[h1]Mass Effect[/h1]
[i]Mass Effect[/i] is such a great introduction to the world itself. I don’t see many sci-fi worlds with this level of depth, an assortment of fantastical technology and alien races makes the world feel very genuine, existing outside of the player's involvement. You see this come to a full head in the Citadel, [i]Mass Effect’s[/i] main hub populated by every alien race, richly detailed with stories to find, brilliant to explore from an outsider perspective.

Exploration is far more prominent here than the rest of the series, but everywhere you can visit feels so barren. There are tons of side-quests that lead to repetitive planets, consisting of basic terrain and the same three interiors repeated. Even the main quest worlds are rather dull, consisting of a handful of uninteresting human colonies, Virmire being the only location I remember fondly. [i]Mass Effect[/i] is willing to throw a lot of objectives at the player, but almost everything that takes you outside of the citadel feels uninteresting, and fails to capitalise on the wonderous world they’ve built here.

The shooting that carries you through the game is fairly decent. A few essential changes have been made from the original, such as guns no longer being locked behind class, which stops some classes from feeling too limited. Each class’ combination of weapons and powers give the player a huge variety of options, complimented by your squadmates, but a lack of the refined shooting and advanced powers makes [i]Mass Effect[/i]’s combat a far cry from the quality of its sequels.

The first game excels as an introduction to the universe and is a good mechanical lead-in to the future titles, but unfortunately by itself, it's a rather clunky and flawed RPG.

[h1]Mass Effect 2[/h1]
This is where [i]Mass Effect[/i] found itself, there are huge improvements in every area, which leads to my favourite game in the trilogy. 

The plot is such an unusual offshoot from the first game, feeling more like a heist movie, as you spend the entire game gathering up twelve squadmates and earning their loyalty to pull off an impossible job. There are only a small handful of missions directly related to the core threat, but they do an impressive build up to an absolutely amazing finale.

This storyline setup is really fun. [i]Mass Effect 2[/i] undeniably feels more character driven with so much of your time dedicated to squadmates, which has always been where the writing shines brightest for me. The variety of your companions and their personalities is fantastic, providing great variety in whose interactions you want to see in each mission. 

However this story feels so disconnected from its predecessor, that it can suffer in its questionable relevance. Shepard is justifiably distant from the first game here, but it does feel as though too many of your previous actions simply don’t matter here. Likewise, your big mission in this game has minimal impact on the sequel, resulting in this title feeling mildly irrelevant despite its amazing storytelling.

Despite the smaller story, [i]Mass Effect 2[/i] does a great job expanding the universe introduced from the first game. Far away from the idealistic society portrayed in the original, the world here mainly consists of the shadier yet beautiful locations, hubs like Omega and Illium feel so distinct from the Citadel, representing the darker societies that inhabit them. There's a much greater variety in aliens to meet, locations to explore and enemies to fight; every aspect of the game is enhanced by the expanded worldbuilding.

Perhaps 2’s greatest strength is in its gameplay improvements. Exploration has been cut down to avoid repetitive empty space, and the class system is fantastic now. Each archetype has its own identity, from the movement based Vanguard to the utilitarian Sentinel, distinct powers and focuses for each class makes combat way more fun as you lean into your specialization. The mechanics in play are ultimately simple for an RPG but extremely effective at making every shootout enjoyable.

[h1]Mass Effect 3[/h1]
The climatic and divisive finale to the trilogy aims to be the biggest title yet, and while there are a few major missteps, overall it's a fairly strong conclusion to the series.


The oncoming threats set up in the first two titles are brought to a head here, leading this title to have a strong “end of days” motif. Everywhere you visit shows the importance of your quest with every race and location you’ve grown to know and love cast into disarray by the reapers. The amount of choices and continued character relations from previous games returning here is insane, all contributing to a united effort, and while these choices were never the most diverse or interesting, it's amazing to see how many of them are acknowledged in this climactic finale.

There's not a huge amount of combat changes, but what is here is deeply appreciable. Changes to movement make combat generally feel smoother and a few ability additions help flesh out your character, you can keep your level from the previous game here and continue that feeling of climbing in power which is great. It does feel as though it's wearing thin, you get into an insane amount of gunfights in this title. I’d recommend taking a break between each game. 3's lack of major innovations can make the combat feel very stale if you play it all back to back.

Both the gameplay and the story heavily prioritise an action tone in this title. I don’t think this really did the series justice, [i]Mass Effect[/i] already had a great balance of Action and RPG in the prior titles, but here we start suffering from the abundance of dated mechanics such as turrets and chase sections. Combined with the finales' insistence to resolve every single contentious point in the entire galaxy, [i]Mass Effect 3[/i] can’t help but feel artificial far too often.

Despite its improvements, [i]Mass Effect 3[/i] will always live in infamy for its writing. It’s still good, most of the time, but it can feel as though key moments in the plot haven’t been thought out nearly enough, such as Shepard’s relationship with Cerberus, or the notoriously awful Kai Leng. The ending in particular, can feel rather lackluster and fails to represent the trilogy. The plot still feels enthralling for most of the run, especially with the enormous improvements to the Paragon/Renegade system no longer locking you down a strict path and instead focusing on a genuine character, but there are enough problems to still blemish the overall story.

Ok, I can see why this was really popular and got a bunch of sequels. There's an epic space opera storyline, and you get to decide the fate of the galaxy by shooting stuff with a gun.

I was honestly kind of disappointed by the gameplay - for all the RPG trappings, it was super shallow and linear. It played a lot like a visual novel with dull shooting sequences between the chapters - it reminds me a bit of Control in that respect, but there's no Ashtray Maze. For all the conversation options, I feel like most of them didn't make any difference. 

There was a skill tree, but I don't feel like it made any difference. I maxed out my intimidate skill, but it enabled an extra conversation option maybe once, early on. Similarly, I maxed out electronics and decryption, but the only time it made checks (that I'm aware of) was to tell me to use my electronics skill to salvage a downed satellite, and then tell me my (very high) electronics skill was too low.

It was pretty satisfying to save the galaxy, but I wish I'd had more fun along the way.

[Mass Effect 2]
This was a much better game than Mass Effect.

My skill tree gave me actual usable abilities instead of intangible attributes whose effects I couldn't see, I got a wide spectrum of secondary characters to work with (or not (Zaeed)), and the majority of the side quests revolved around the interesting secondary characters instead of being ""go to this planet and shoot some dudes for some credits"".

The missions are still largely oriented around shooting dudes from behind rows of boxes, but they did change it up on a number of occasions, and the addition of the abilities added an extra dimension to the box-shooting, at least.

The story was even more epic, if possible, and I felt like Shepard had more agency to affect its path.

I'm genuinely looking forward to Mass Effect 3.

[Mass Effect 3]
Mass Effect 3 was certainly a game. It started out feeling very epic in scope, and the ending was very strong (if a little oorah), but I felt like the middle was a wide sea of meh.

You're supposed to be recruiting factions and gathering resources for the war effort, but almost all of the missions feel very generic and samey. The teammate options are also pruned way down from ME2.

Overall, I don't regret playing it, and I really enjoyed the conclusions of a few of the storylines, but in the latter half I was just slogging through to resolve the story and get my 100GB back.

[Overall]
Mass Effect Legendary is a very good game (Mass Effect 2) with a dull prologue (Mass Effect 1) and an overly drawn-out conclusion (Mass Effect 3). I enjoyed most of my time with it, but I probably won't buy Andromeda.",1692738322,1708801096,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

At time of review, you'd see I have 100% completed the achievements across about 200 hours of gameplay. This is but a fraction of the actual time I've spent with this trilogy, with my playthroughs of each game well into the 20-count across my original Xbox 360 copies, my PC copies on Origin, and here on the Legendary Edition. I've basically mapped each game to the back of my mind, and know each and every corner of them. Mass Effect is one of my favourite series of all time. No questions, no doubts, and the Legendary Collection is, far and beyond, the best way to experience the original trilogy.

Starting with Mass Effect 1, this is where the Legendary changes are the strongest. I've always had a bit of a special appreciation for the original ME1's gameplay, given I had played through it about eight times before ME2 was even released. But it has aged pretty poorly, and my recommendation to play the trilogy always came with the caveat of ""please tolerate ME1's gameplay and don't just go into ME2 with Genesis"". Legendary Edition not only drastically polishes the game up, but it gently overhauls the gameplay to be more in line with the other two. Cover shooting is much more responsive, training requirements are mostly abolished so all of the weapons you carry are actually usable rather than just what your class specializes in, AI is a bit more responsive and less buggy, targeting with powers is a bit more consistent, weapon equips now have different properties to give them different playstyles... there are a lot of changes, and it does still play like ME1. But it is unquestionably the best way to play ME1, and I can now happily recommend it without caveats.

Mass Effect 2 feels the least touched, which is simultaneously a good thing and a bad thing. ME2 was caught in a visually awkward period between reusing a lot of ME1 assets with minimal improvements to the textures and models, and leaning into a more distinct visual style that would be further cemented by ME3. So while ME2 Legendary has been given visual improvements across the board, it now feels the most noticeably weak visually. Additionally, if you were a fan of ME2's gameplay, it's basically unchanged aside from dispersing DLC weapons into the game's shops. But, personally, I've always felt ME2 was a little flat in terms of its gameplay. It doesn't quite reach the levels of insanity that ME1 gunfights can reach in the later levels, and doesn't have the distinct flow and strength of ME3's gunfights. ME2 could've used a few improvements, but leaving it alone makes the most sense given its enormously venerated social status. I know my quibbles with the game are entirely my own, contrarian that I am.

Mass Effect 3 remains my favourite of the trilogy, and the only thing missing from it here in Legendary Edition is the multiplayer. It's still a genuine shame that it wasn't able to make the jump in a more accessible format, but ME3 stands pretty proudly on its own. Even if you're not a fan of the endings ([i]I am, and always have been[/i]), the gameplay, writing, and visual quality all the way through is all aces. Every time I do a trilogy run, getting to ME3 gets me fired up because it's time to have the most fun with the best missions and the best gunplay.

If you haven't tried the trilogy before, this is me telling you it's time. Even at full price, it's absolutely worth the cost of entry. Three of the most incredible modern RPGs, polished up to near-perfection, ready for you to experience them either once again or for the very first time.",1708696659,1708696659,True,1,0,0.511278212070465088,0,True,False,False

The plot of the first game is pretty great. The second drags its feet for a while and has problems with pacing but warms up to be a great antihero plot. The third just sucks, and requires you gargle EA mayo for ~100 hours to get the """"""good"""""" ending, not to mention the bugs that can render any sidequest uncompletable, which starves you of good boy points.

Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a remastered collection of the original Mass Effect trilogy, one of the most acclaimed sci-fi RPG series of all time. The Legendary Edition features enhanced textures, animations, graphics, and performance, as well as various bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. It also includes all the DLC content for the three games, except for the Pinnacle Station DLC for Mass Effect 1, which was lost due to corrupted source code. The DLC weapons and outfits are no longer available from the start, but are distributed throughout the game or sold in stores, making the progression more balanced and rewarding.

[h3]Like[/h3]

Mass Effect Legendary Edition delivers the best sci-fi story in game form yet, with an amazing cast and characters that are brought to life by the stellar voice acting. The gameplay is improved with some quality of life options, such as unified controls, faster elevators, and better inventory management. The graphics upgrade is also noticeable, especially on ME1, which looks much more polished and detailed. The choices made in the game do feel like they matter, as they affect the outcome of the story and the relationships with the crew. All of this epicness is packaged into one single “game”, which is a delight for fans and newcomers alike. Moreover, the Legendary Edition fixes some of the major bugs that plagued the original game, the achievement/trophy unlocking issues, and the pre-rendered cutscene darkness. These fixes make the game more enjoyable and immersive, without compromising the original vision of the developers.alike.

[h3]Dislike[/h3]

Mass Effect Legendary Edition is not without its flaws, however. I encountered multiple bugs during my playthrough, some of which were game-breaking. I had to restart the game twice in ME1 and three times in ME2 due to crashes. I also experienced some in-game glitches, mainly collision issues, such as enemies getting stuck behind objects and preventing me from progressing. The animation, although improved, still felt stiff and weird at times, especially during conversations. I was disappointed to see that some of the bugs from the original game were not fixed, such as the camera tracking and collision issue that I could replicate in this version. The exclusion of one DLC, Pinnacle Station, also made me feel like this was not the complete edition of the trilogy. Lastly, the game required me to install the EA app, which I found unnecessary and annoying, especially after having trouble with it in the past with Dragon Age on Steam.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a must-have for fans of the original trilogy, as well as for newcomers who want to experience one of the best sci-fi RPGs of all time. The game offers a captivating story, memorable characters, and meaningful choices, all enhanced by the improved graphics, gameplay, and performance. However, the game is not flawless, and suffers from some bugs, glitches, and crashes that can ruin the immersion and enjoyment. The game also requires the EA app, which can be annoying for some players. Despite these drawbacks, I still recommend this game to anyone who loves sci-fi, action, and adventure.

-movement with keyboard/mouse can be clunky at times, and some areas make for really tight and awkward maneuvering; this is minor as you get used to it as you go along, but don't expect your character to have completely fluid and smooth response within the environment on par with say a doom eternal or cyberpunk 2077 or any other modern 1st or 3rd person shooter
- though an older game with a new layer of modern graphics-paint slapped over it, the new stuff does require some serious GPU power, and my GPU gtx 1650 was pushing 70+ C most of the time playing so just be aware, keep your internal fans cranked etc.


FYI= this is not a neg for me since I have space, but you cannot pick and choose which games to install.  When you get this and install, it will install the ENTIRE trilogy which is 109 gb in a folder under steam for me.

ME1: Best ""pure RPG"" of the three, great introduction to the world and characters. Combat definitely shows its age as enemies are just numb bulletsponges. You can almost feel like it's KOTOR with shooting mechanics... almost. 8/10

ME2: Best character development, IMHO worst combat of the three, it's a bit more fluid than 1, but relies even more on sponginess of the enemies, which makes later encounters just tedious - not hard, just tedious. Things take annoying amount of time to kill and game relies way too much on throwing a lot of shit at you from all directions. Story overall felt like it didn't move that much in the grander scheme though, ME2 definitely felt more focused on smaller stories and world building - however that only becomes apparent once you're playing ME3. 8/10

ME3: Had a bit much on it's plate in terms of story and tying up loose ends due to ME2 not doing any of it really, but overall executed it fairly well I'd say - at least coming into it with extended ending of the Legendary Edition + after finishing the DLC stories first. Easily the most enjoyable gameplay and combat out of the three - however it lacked in bossfights - there wasn't much of an attempt at anything mechanically interesting. Soo... a bit of a hot take, but I'd give it a 9/10 purely because gameplay was just so much more fun than previous 2, and the rest of it was almost just as good. If I am doing a replay in the future, this is the one I am looking forward to most.

Overall a great trilogy, I can absolutely see Netflix ruining it with their adaptation in the future.",1708290460,1708290460,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

So, while I'm keeping my original review up for the sake of cataloging an issue that has happened before, and may happen again, I am recommending the Legendary Edition as the definitive way to play the Mass Effect Trilogy. The much larger and more active modding scene is reason enough alone. As for reasons to play Mass Effect if you aren't already sold on the series, what can I say but that it's one of the all-time great space operas in or out of the gaming medium. Its combat is engaging, its story and setting are immersive enough to get lost in for days on end, and its cast of characters is second to none. Coming back to the Mass Effect Trilogy always feels like revisiting old friends. These are my comfort games, the games I always come back to when I just want to forget my troubles and wile away the hours. I'd still advise picking it up on sale if you can wait, though I'm far less hesitant to recommend buying MELE now that the EA app isn't acting up nearly as often. However, as always, caveat emptor.

(Original review: Played for 450 hours as of this post, and I have 2500 hours in the original trilogy. I adore the Mass Effect series to death. That said, EA's new launcher won't even launch the game for me, and every method the community develops to play without online connection gets patched away, keeping me from accessing my own games that I fucking payed for. This is completely unacceptable. EA is up and revoking people's ability to play offline.

If you want to play it, then either wait or pick it up on the high seas. Fuck EA.)",1684367190,1708152659,True,0,0,0.593264877796173096,0,True,False,False

The world-building is insane on par with games like Cyberpunk and The Witcher 3 if not more in-depth in my opinion. The story is just legendary and it speaks for itself in terms of awards. The RPG elements like decisions are one of the key aspects to this game and it's one reason which makes the game so incredibly memorable, especially when you can import your character/save into all 3 games so ultimately you end up with a Shepard who you've gotten to know for 50 plus hours alongside all your companions.

Rant: EA are just the reverse King Midas; everything they touch they turn to shit.

90% off and $5 for what's been one of my favourite trilogies, and I finally decided to pick it up to play them again. 
And still, I've been debating whether to refund it just to not give them $5. That's how fucking done I am with EA anymore.

The advertised ultrawide support has not only been generally underwhelming, it tried to autodetect resolution on launch, failed, then somehow crashed my computer and broke my NVIDIA surround. 
So now I have been fixing my system today instead of gaming.
How about a display configuration utility in the fucking launcher instead you absolute fucking ass monkeys?

Uninstalled, requested refund, swore a lot. Then remembered I only paid $5 and I actually *would* like to play these again, so I cancel the refund and re-download the 110GB. 

It does run in ultrawide 5840x1080 now after fixing my displays and getting NVIDIA Surround setup proper again. Antialiasing is bugged through all 3 games and has to be turned off, but whatever, the usual EA jank... 

I'm having fun ...mostly. These are pretty good games still ...mostly.

For a remaster of one of their fan favorites, the execution here is pretty lazy and typical what you expect from EA. There's graphics bugs left unfixed, stuttering framerates while driving around planets, bugs left in that have been there since these games were originally released ... 

And then there's their abomination of a useless launcher getting rammed down my throat.. -_-

On the positive side, I will say it's cool playing the ME3 DLC I ignored when I first played it, since after buying all 3 games being asked to fork out for an actual prothean character (you know, the race central during the ENTIRE STORY of the trilogy) just ticked me off. Which made me completely ignore the other DLC content. And some of that is actually pretty good.

Retaking Omega with Aria and the whole Citadel/Shore leave story. Those were good fun and full of funny writing. That's actually the kind of DLC I don't mind - actual content that adds gameplay. 
If you didn't play the trilogy already though, it's hard to know which are the DLC and they often break the flow of the story. Eg. there's an enemy which has a kinda dramatic reveal in the storyline, but if you play the DLC first, they just casually get thrown at you.

I really recommend turning up the difficulty to make the most of the battles, because otherwise the actual action sequences in the game, are painfully short and it turns into neverending fetch quests and dialogue.

- Live characters
- Immersive 
Cons:

Truly a legend of RPGs with an interesting plot and fascinating setting. The gameplay feels kind of outdated though. Nevertheless, it doesn’t really affect the game, as personally, for me it was just about the story and deep narrative. Pity, that I didn’t play it earlier.

""Of course, it would do good to business.""

At first, I didn't see myself putting too much effort into an entire new franchise, even though I'm really into space and was always fascinated by the futuristic or exploring games (a couple of examples being Deus Ex - Revolution & Mankind Divided, Witcher, No Man's Sky, PREY etc.), but my God I would lie if I said that I wasn't [b]Addicted[/b] to find out what happens after the first game, and it continued after the 2nd one too, and here I am today, after I completed the last one of the trilogy. 

The entire franchise was a masterpiece, from top to bottom, even though I must admit, I [b]despised[/b] Mass Effect 2's planet scanning, as I like to 100% a game before I go into the next one, so you would imagine how many hours I put only into scanning every planet for the last drop of element zero or platinum. But man, I got so deep into the storyline, that it's one of the [b]FEW[/b] games in which I'm so sad that it ended, and I wish I had another 115 hours to spend again to go through the entire trillogy and experience the game again. 
Of course, I won't be able to experience it as if it's the first time, but it was such a great experience that I would go through it again.

[h1]Mass Effect 1 - the buggy simulator[/h1]
In the first hours, I was getting adapted to the combat system, the ,as you would call it, right side pannel of abilities and team management. 
Infiltrator perk / class seemed like the most fitting one for my character (who I tried to make him look as close as possible as me), so I went with it.
The first few missions went really well, but I regret that I didn't chose the Insanity difficulty, since it [b]at least[/b] gives a good meaning of a challenge, especially for an infiltrator.
Near the end of the game, you pretty much [b]one shot or two shot[/b] almost every single enemy you encounter with the sniper rifle, needless to say on the last boss.


[h3]The one thing I disliked a little bit in ME: 1[/h3]
The MAKO or ""Buggy"" part of the game seemed interesting, but after you nail down the movement and the [b]four or five[/b] combat encounters, you're pretty much stuck going from planet to planet to get the debris or explore the question marks. 
That's it, the rest of the game was fantastic to me, except of course the casual crash or stuttering.

[h1] Mass Effect 2 - the scanning hell[/h1]
The first noticeable change in this next game was that the power ups weren't on the right side anymore, but at the bottom.
This took some adapting, even though it was fast, but visually it was better. The combat system was better, movement was better and it felt like a direct upgrade of the first game.

[h3] What I [b]hated[/b] about ME:2[/h3]
The scanning. My God the scanning was hell of a task to fully 100% this entire game.
That's it.

[h1] Mass Effect 3 - the emotional rollercoaster[/h1]
This game is where shit hits the fan, movement between covers, [b]hopping[/b] over the cover which I adored a lot, weapons were meh except the harpoon cannon which is extremely OP. The characters and the dialogue feel more alive, with many choices, and I liked the DLC integration too, both in ME2 and ME3.
The ending really struck me though, even if I watched it very long ago when the game dropped, it felt geniune and raw this time I played it, and I loved it.

[h3] What I disliked about ME:3[/h3]
More stuttering at some places, the way of easily missing a mission on Omega and not being able to replay / visit the area to complete it.

In all seriousness, I picked this game up on sale for £4.99 and for that price ME:LE is exceptional value with all 3 games taking me around 100 hours to beat while completing the majority of side missions.. I played it entirely on the Steam Deck OLED and had an absolute blast. Performance-wise I got a pretty-solid 60-70fps throughout with VERY occasional stutter.

In my case I had no real issues with the EA launcher (though it's a pain it exists in the first place).

-ME1: Very good story and dialogues, best of the series because they have a massive repertoire of decisions that can be made. Very basic third person shooter with a basic cover system which is basically useless if you ask me. The AI is quite dreadful and easily exploitable because most enemies run very slowly. Quests and missions are quite dull but there are good sequences and foundations to really enjoy your progression through the game.

What makes this game incredibly good is the management of your squad and your abilities via combat pause. Not many games use this kind of system and it really works in this game because, there are a lot of abilities and choices to make in which doing it in real time would be extremely difficult. It is impressive the world they have created and everything you can explore.

-ME2: This is probably the worst of the series because, it does a 180 on the story and it forces you to use the cover system. The cover system is not terrible but it changes the gameplay dynamics drastically compared to ME1, where I believe it did not need to. The story is also pretty bad from beginning to end. It is very unfortunate that they went the route they did but, it is very unique and it did spice things up.

Compared to ME1, ME2 is a lot more linear and has less decisive dialogues, making it an easy paragon or renegade choice. Also there are so many new squad mates that it gets too much following the side stories. The amount of work to get these stories working is insane compared to the payout. They also added ammo to weapons in ME2 which completely destroys the fast pace and smoothness that ME1 had with infinite ammo. Worst part of all of it is the dismantling on the talent tree. How can you remove the intricate system of ME1 and replace it with the awful system of ME2? Disgraceful.

It does improve a bit with the missions and settings. While ME1 is just huge maps of nothing with a few objectives, ME2 is more cohesive and has more dynamic levels, shorter and does not waste your time as much. It is still a good game but it tries to do a lot without it being worthwhile.

-ME3: The best gameplay of the series. Quick, very slick, easy to manoeuvre and excellent gun play for a third person shooter.  Completely improves everything ME2 fails to do, including the talent tree which is more fleshed out and has more decisions for the player. 

The story unfortunately does not make much sense after ME2 as it tries to course correct and follow what ME1 story was trying to do. It also does ""member berries"" here and there which is alright but, to be honest it does not really work in many of the situations. The whole story is very deficient. Dialogue options are very linear with once in a while choice for renegade or paragon. I prefer this way because it means less effort on quantity and quality of dialogues and more improvements in gameplay.

Otherwise, the AI is way better than the previous game, excellent maps and levels, cover system is great, powers in cover actually work properly, weapon diversity is fantastic, Weapon mods customisation is a welcome addition. ME3 does a lot right and almost no faults.

-ME3: CItadel DLC: This is horrendous. If you ever want to see what ""woke"" writing looks like, play the Citadel DLC. The worst writing I have seen in a while and bastardise the entire art that is Mass Effect. It literally takes a dump on the whole game, that is how bad this DLC is. I would say avoid like the plague. 

Also, it was with the Citadel DLC that I discovered the use and abuse of powers, especifically ""Adrenaline shot"". Once I found out how broken it is to get 200% power recharge and spam powers, this game became absurdly trivial and very unfun. I basically played the entire game as a typical shooter, some sort of hardmode and the last 15 hours ended up being unkillable while abusing powers. Being able to do this ruins the fun of the game.",1707704475,1707704475,True,2,0,0.513777256011962891,0,True,False,False

Mass Effect 1 had a compelling sci-fi story with incredible and well written characters and a fleshed out world, which came attached to a third person shooter that outdated even for 2007 when ME1 released. 

Mass Effect 2 scaled back the story to almost solely being about Shepard and their companions while adding on to the existing setting with more lore and locations. It also refining the gunplay and rpg mechanics to be a fun shooter that even merits replayability to see how different classes engage with combat. 

Mass Effect 3 expands the scope of the game to the entire galaxy, rather than the sections of it the player was confined to for the first 2 games. However the story attached to the expanded play area was just okay, and clearly underdeveloped. However, it does have by far the best third person shooter gameplay of the 3 entries. Each game seems tailored for a different type of player so it can be jarring going from to the next.

that being said, I recommend the trilogy in it's entirety just to be able to experience a trilogy of games with the same player made protagonist, which is still a rare feat among rpg game series with multiple entries.

[b]You have played the whole series [/b]
This game is a [i]should[/i] have, not essential for you, only if you missed some DLC's or you catch a nice discount. This edition have some quality of life improvements, graphics enhancements and a ""linear"" progression between the 3 games. I put the linear between quotes because you can play all the series with the same character, but the character progression have some differences between games. Plot related, maybe. The improvements in this legendary edition maybe couldn't justify at all, the extra money if you already have the series.

[b] You never played, or finished the Mass Effect trilogy [/b]
Short answer: amazing series (9/10). If you like RPG's, action RPG's, is a [b]must[/b] have.

[b]Main story[/b] - You create a character, you have a spaceship, some bad dudes appear, you must kill the bad dudes so you can restore order. This was a over simplification of the plot, but the main story is basically a space opera. In my opinion, the main story is the main shortcoming of the series. Lacks consistency, complexity and engagement. Altough the main story lacks content, is very well crafted across the 3 games, emphasizing the dramatic [i]crescendo[/i] until the very end.

[b]Side quests[/b] - Here, this gem starts to shine. There's some amazing side quests, some from DLC, which really worth playing. There's this thing about Mass Effect, the story is quite bland, but all the lore complexity allows a rich side questing content. In this aspect, Mass Effect is really good.

[b]Gameplay[/b] - Top notch. The gameplay is action-oriented, with tactical choices and commands to your squad. The controls are simple are while you give instructions the action is frozen, so you can think and act while in combat. When not fighting, you navigate your spaceship in solar systems, wander through cities and settlements, go shopping, talk here and there. While talking, you can chose the flow of the conversation, by reacting or asking about specific topics. 

[b]Graphics[/b] - I really liked the graphics of this edition. This is a very subjective topic, so I will just leave my personal opinion. I played the original game for Xbox 360 and played the 2 for PC. I noticed a higher graphical quality in this edition, even playing at full HD resolution.  The graphical effects seem abundant and well placed and the animations very sharp. 

[b]Sound and Music[/b] - Since we aren't in 1992 anymore, and a Soundblaster compatible card isn't a requirement to enjoy good sound quality, yes, the sound quality is acceptable. Well, the sound effects are appropriate and the voice actors made a terrific job. The music is very good. Each game have a unique music piece, while playing you'll start identifying them. Overall the music is a blend of orchestral cinematic music, synth and space ambient. Some pieces are trully unforgettable. Tip: there's some videos in Youtube of x-hours of mass effect space exploration music, it's nice soundtrack while working or studying :)

Overall is a must have for RPG fans, truly a masterpiece. I think it was one of the last games to be a testament to Bioware quality. Where passion and commitment are clearly poured in this series.",1707607795,1707607795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, my only real complaint is with Mass Effect 2, which is that you are very limited with what weapons you can use and how you can modify them. In Mass Effect 1 & 3 you can put mods on your guns, and have a very large selection of weapons to use. In mass effect 2, you have less than a handful of weapons you can use, I used the assault rifle as my main weapon across all 3, and in ME2 there were only 4 that I had by the end of the playthough. I know I could've missed some weapons, however, the game focuses on buying enhancements through the shops to increase damage or allowing piercing on the weapons.

BioWare's masterpiece has left an indelible mark on my gaming soul, and here's why

First and foremost, the narrative brilliance of the Mass Effect Trilogy is unparalleled. The depth of the story, the intricacies of the characters, and the sheer scope of the galactic adventure kept me hooked from the very beginning. The way the trilogy seamlessly weaves together an epic tale of interstellar conflict, moral choices, and personal relationships is a testament to the studio's storytelling prowess

The character development throughout the trilogy is nothing short of extraordinary. From Commander Shepard, the charismatic and customizable protagonist, to the diverse and memorable squad members, each character contributes to the richness of the narrative. Witnessing their growth, facing moral dilemmas, and forming deep connections with them made the journey feel incredibly personal

The world-building in Mass Effect is simply breathtaking. The meticulously crafted planets, the varied alien species, and the attention to detail in every corner of the galaxy create a sense of immersion that is second to none. Whether I was exploring the bustling streets of the Citadel or navigating the hazardous terrain of an uncharted planet, the level of detail and creativity in the game world was consistently impressive

The gameplay mechanics are both engaging and dynamic. The combination of intense third-person shooter action, strategic decision-making, and RPG elements offered a perfect blend that kept the gameplay experience fresh and exciting throughout the trilogy. The combat scenarios were thrilling, the exploration was rewarding, and the sense of agency in shaping the narrative added an extra layer of depth to the overall experience

The Mass Effect Trilogy's musical score deserves special mention, perfectly complemented the emotional highs and lows of the story. The sweeping orchestral pieces and haunting melodies enhanced the atmosphere, making every moment feel epic and memorable

In conclusion, the Mass Effect Trilogy is not just a collection of games; it's an emotional and immersive odyssey that will stay with me for years to come. BioWare has created a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of gaming, delivering an unparalleled storytelling experience in the vastness of space

the story you go through as Shepherd is also amazing, you take this character and you can change so much. from little things to bigger things, you as Shepherd can change the outcome based on what you do and i think that is awesome!

Few games make me genuinely care for its characters the way Mass Effect does. The story is good, although HEAVILY inspired by Babylon 5 and it has its flaws, but it's the characters and the way they're written and performed, that make these games something truly special. Every one of them has a deep, believable backstory and diverse personalities that make them all unique and feel like real people. Like any good sci-fi, there's dozens (if not hundreds) of hours of lore here filled to the brim with interesting alien species, intergalactic politics and plenty of mystery to keep you hooked. The soundtrack is also excellent at setting the tone of the games and it has some iconic tracks. It's hard to stay objective about a trilogy this influential, but the games do have a couple shortcomings, mainly due to their age. If you regularly play older games than you're probably fine, but otherwise the gameplay can be a bit clunky and it takes some getting used to. Ultimately, I would massively recommend Mass Effect Legendary Edition to anyone who is looking for a new universe to get lost in or just wants to experience a true classic.

The reason i don't recommend the LE is because of how a missed opportunity it actually is. Very few changes have been done to the first game on the combat part, and while it improves a good chunk of it, the fact that the companion AI is the same, which is non-existant, is quite obvious. Also, they could have added a few more prefabs to the ""secondary quests"" just to spice things up a little. There are still bugs that have been not adressed from the original game.

For the part of ME2 and ME3 have not been changed, at least not in a noticeable way. While this is ok for ME3, with 2 it sticks out like a sore thumb. Half the issues with ME2 cannot be solve without remaking the entire game, since those are mostly story related, but the combat on 2 was quite poorly designed. It mostly made classes that do not have access to assault rifles or snipers underwhelming unless playing on the average difficulties, completely killing the fun of biotics and engineers. And this has not been changed in this edition.

On other aspects, the game's performance is good, logically since the graphics are 360/PS3 era. And the nostalgia travel have been good. But this is worth the 6€ i paid this christmas.

I've played this triology 4 times before this. People say that ME 3 ending ruined the franchise, but I strongly disagree and I think that problems started in first 10 minutes of the ME 2 and that ending was just culmination of big problems that appeared through second and third part of the triology. 

[h1]Difference between Original and Legendary Edition[/h1] There is not much difference, ME 1 got slightly enhanced visuals, Pinnacle station got removed, worse performance on uncharted planets, ME2 also runs worse, however ME3 works great, and what's different is that multiplayer got removed and now you need more war assets for some endings.

[h1]Mass Effect 1 - 9/10[/h1] 
- Story is set within galaxy in the year 2183 where interstellar travel is possible through the use of mass transit devices called Mass Relays, a technology believed to have been built by an extinct alien race known as the Protheans. The government body known as the Citadel Council controls a large percentage of the galaxy and is responsible for maintaining law and order among races of the galactic community. The protagonist of the game is Commander Shepard of special forces program and a candidate to become the first human Spectre, agents given unlimited authority by the Citadel Council to protect the galaxy, they are above the law and answer only to the Council. As Spectre you are given spaceship and crew under your command. What follows is a really interesting journey about seeking knowledge, trying to find ways to beat your enemy, but there may not even be the way, so maybe you need to prepare for your doom. Whole game is very mystical, and at the end of the game you are left with a lot of questions, but with a very good core concepts which leave you desiring for more. Overall really amazing story.
- Characters are very loveable, through the journey you can acquire up to 6 squadmates, meaning that you can choose whether you want to hire some of them. Every mission you choose 2 squadmates, you can level up their stats, change their weapons, talk with them on your ship outside of mission, have romances, bond friendships and so on. 
- Choices are great. Every dialogue you have a lot of options to choose from, and some decisions that you have to make are really interesting and globally important. You also have paragon and renegade meters which are basically good and evil scales, and based on percentage of your paragon/renegade meters you will have options to do/say good/bad deeds through the game, however sometimes renegade may actually be good, so it's all up to you. Choices also ""affect"" other 2 games.
- Gameplay is a classical third-person shooter gameplay mixed with option to pause the game so you can activate powers, order your squad etc. There are few weapon classes to choose from, you can change weapons all the time, buy at shops, upgrade, sell stuff etc. What makes weapons in this game great is the fact that you have endless ammo based on advanced technology and all you have to worry about is overheating. Aside from combat you also have Mako which is a space car that you use while exploring uncharted planets. You can talk with NPCs on your missions, just like in most RPGs.
- Aside from main missions there is also a lot of side content and most of side stuff is exploring uncharted planets, searching for minerals, visiting strange facilities, fighting various enemies etc. 
- Around 35 h to 100% complete the game

[h1]Mass Effect 2 - 5/10[/h1] 
- I hate the story of this game, I literally hate it. In first 10 minutes of the game some ship attacks you and all your crew flees except you, and you literally die by falling from space to the planet surface. You are completelly dead, but somehow evil organization from the first game, that wasn't even important before decides to spend billions of credits trying to revive you, and after 2 years you are alive again. WTF. My interest in the game dies already at this point, I hated it after this. And it doesn't get better at all. So like I already said in first game you are seeking the knowledge, trying to find ways to prepare for your doom or to somehow beat your enemies, and it's logical that you will continue doing that. Nope, writers of Mass Effect 2 decided to completelly ignore events of the first game and focus on new enemy that kinda has connection to the enemy of the first game, but whole concept is so stupid that it hurts. Whole game feels like a big filler. You can acquire up to 12 squadmates and you can do loyal mission for each of them. Cerberus, an evil organization that revived you is so unnecessary and stupid that it ruined not just this game, but third game too. Illusive Man who is owner of this organization is a guy with diamonds instead of eyes, dude smokes 24/7 and drinks whiskey and somehow knows everything while having unlimited money. This organization used to do experiments on people and now you are forced to side with them cause story wants so. One of the squad members from the first game who was researching old ruins in the first game is now number 1 information trader. That makes no sense at all. Right before final mission FOR NO REASON whole squad decides to leave the ship, you just click on map and they go and leave whole crew unarmed in critical moments. This just happens so plot can progress, I won't spoil how. 
- Dialogue is cringe af, especially in the beginning. There is one moment when you randomly approach alien holding gun and he tells you ""do you have a problem with me"", and then Shepard takes out his gun and says something like: ""Look at the size of this gun, you don't want to mess with me"" LOL. 
- Last boss is so lame, but last mission overall is good, it's a suicide mission and your squadmates can actually die permanently. In every mission you go and shoot gangs, you rarely stop to talk with NPCs to find out more, it's not a RPG anymore, it's a shooter. New characters are okay. Around 45 h to 100% complete it.
- One of the rare good things about this game is gameplay, it's really really fun, best in the triology imo, if we ignore the fact that they replaced infinite ammo with thermal clips, so now you have bullets instead of advanced alien technology... 

[h1]Mass Effect 3 - 6/10[/h1] 
- Gameplay is okay. Dialogue has less options than before. Takes around 45-50 h to 100% complete it.
- Story is terrible again, but at least it got some old conflicts resolved. Instead of fighting real enemy from the first game, you are mostly fighting [spoiler]Cerberus[/spoiler] cause they are space Nazis now, killing everyone for no real reason and have their own Bruce Lee. Yes there is a stupid explanation, but it doesn't fit this game, it's unnecessary and stupid. I dislike Cerberus so much that after 100% completing ME1 and ME2 this time I couldn't bother to play ME3 again. ME1 clearly stated that we don't have a chance against the enemy fighting with guns, yet whole game we are trying to acquire war assets and instead of using them since we spent our time doing so, they don't matter. I mean they do, but in illogical sense. [spoiler]At the end you have a choice to press one of 3 buttons, and decide destiny of the whole galaxy, so all your war assets (armies, weapons, people etc.) only matter in a way that they let you press correct button. That's like having 3 colored cookies (blue, red, yellow) and being able to eat blue one if you eat alone, but if you bring your whole family you can eat any of them, makes no sense.[/spoiler] Only great things about this story are 2 conflicts resolved and also Leviathan DLC which is now a side mission. 

[i]Note: This explains how I rate games in my reviews. https://imgur.com/s7VB3Vj[/i]

Every time I try to load any of the ME games it crashes and RAM spikes to 14gb.I end up having to hard reset my steam deck every single time. I’ve gone as far as reinstalling the game, unlinking my steam account from EA, playing around with proton and even factory resetting my steam deck.

Mass Effect introduces players to a captivating galaxy teeming with lore and richly developed characters. While the original version had its quirks, the remastered edition polishes these imperfections, delivering a visually stunning experience that aligns it more closely with its successors.

Mass Effect 2 stands out as a pinnacle of the series, flawlessly amplifying its predecessor's strengths. With tighter combat mechanics, intricate storytelling, and pulse-pounding missions, it earns its place among the top games of all time. The depth of character development is unparalleled, with favorites like Miranda Lawson, Garrus, and Thane standing out amidst an exceptional ensemble. The DLCs further enrich the experience, introducing captivating new characters and missions.

Mass Effect 3 thrusts players into a breathtaking conflict as the Reapers descend upon the galaxy, culminating in a riveting battle for survival.

Every time when I want to play a single player solo game, I have to wait what feels like 10-15 minutes for the EA launcher to get updated. On the Steam Deck there is a 50% chance that this update will brake the game. That means that I have to go to desktop mode, delete the folder where the EA Launcher is and wait again for Steam to install it. This fixes the launch issues for a day or two, but after that the process starts to repeat again.",1706553803,1706553803,False,0,0,0.476722538471221924,0,True,False,False

The fact that the story overall somewhat forms a coherent narrative on top of the morality/choice and combat/gameplay mechanics is astounding.
The games on their own are quite weak; the first is nice and perhaps the most replayable (in my opinion) but lacks companion interactions and player relationships, yet ironically is the most role-play like game of the three.
The second seem to be the weakest, because now that there are better companion interactions, the gameplay is completely overhauled in favor of modern-day gunplay; which can be jarring if you continue into the second game immediately after finishing the first one.
The third, however, seemed to find a somewhat amicable balance between R.P.G. progression and gunplay, on top of partner and N.P.C. interactions, although never excelling in either.
The only thing I really hated from this collection are the inconsistencies between all three games. Perhaps they've always been there, but they are more noticeable now since all three are so easy to play straight through. Few examples are the thermal clip mechanics just for the sake of having ammo in the second and third game (gameplay wise), The captains cabin music in the second game changed from iconic tracks of the first game to some generic electronic by the time you reach the third game (or perhaps I didn't win enough tracks in the Citadel DLC), and exploration mechanics changing from game to game; the first was the nicest since you actually landed on the planets (though mostly barren). The second was the most frustrating since you have to farm the planets through multiple probes. The third rectifies this but it's more of an expedited form of the farming that comes from the second game.
Overall, I give this series a 8/10.",1706504602,1706504602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because I still fail to find a real contender. Experience this universe and characters across these 3 games is really something special that stays with you even a while after you finish it.

Now each game in the trilogy is somewhat unique on the positives or negatives it brings.

The original Mass Effect is just dated in many aspects with the gameplay being the worst offender. It just never reaches above mediocre for the year 2024 even with the upgrades of Legendary Edition. However, to compensate the universe and lore work is outstanding even if sometimes presented in a boring way (out of the way side quests and text based exposition). A lot of the character setup which will payoff later is also done here which is an underrated aspects of ME1.

Mass Effect 2 is my favorite and it is just the better individual game from the trilogy. The setup with the suicide mission and having to recruit your squadmates just works brilliantly.  There is so much freedom in what way you can approach the content presented to you. If the first game sells you on the universe then the second game is the one sells you on the characters. The only flaw I can think of is that the plot of ME2 is somewhat disconnected from the main conflict which always felt a bit weird in retrospective.

Now the third game is complicated. I still think it is a great game that has a few rare terrible moments in it. The gameplay feels great still and ends up as a good iteration of ME2. The setup for the final part of the plot also work great with ME3 having a really strong opening. The plot points related to your companions from previous games are handled really well imo and take into account a lot of your actions across the entire trilogy. However, the main plot kind of stumbles after the initial arc with a very meandering middle portion and luck luster ending both from a story and gameplay perspective. This has been talked to death over the years so there is no need to rant anymore about it.

Overall, Mass Effect ends up being a lot more than the sum of its parts. It creates one of my fovorite SciFi universe and characters with moments that no other SciFi setting game has managed to top thus far.",1706375719,1706375719,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Title: ""A Stellar Journey Revisited: Mass Effect Legendary Edition""

Review:

There are few games in the vast cosmos of RPGs that have left a mark as indelible as the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. As a fervent fan, I can unequivocally say that this game stands as my all-time favorite RPG. My journey with Mass Effect began during a summer holiday that now seems like a distant, yet cherished memory. It was a period marked by days and nights seamlessly blending into one another, as I delved deeper into its rich, immersive universe, barely pausing for sleep.

The experience of playing Mass Effect is like embarking on an interstellar odyssey. The game's ability to intertwine an epic narrative with deeply personal stories is nothing short of masterful. Each character I encountered was not just a digital creation but a being with hopes, fears, and aspirations. The connection I felt with these characters was profound, transcending beyond the screen and impacting me on a personal level.

One of the most striking aspects of Mass Effect is how it allows players to shape their journey. Each decision, each interaction, felt weighted with significance, contributing to a narrative tapestry that was uniquely mine. This level of personal investment in the storyline is a rare feat in gaming, one that Mass Effect accomplishes with aplomb.

Moreover, the Legendary Edition’s enhancements only serve to amplify this epic saga. From the refined graphics that breathe new life into familiar landscapes and characters, to the improved gameplay mechanics that make the experience smoother and more engaging, every aspect of the game has been meticulously upgraded.

There's a certain melancholy that comes with completing a game as rich and absorbing as Mass Effect. It's akin to saying goodbye to a dear friend, knowing that the experience cannot be replicated. I often find myself wishing I could erase my memories of the game, to play it once more with fresh eyes, to experience the thrill of the unknown, the excitement of first discoveries.

In conclusion, the Mass Effect Legendary Edition is not just a game; it's a journey—a saga that transcends its medium. It stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in video games and remains a beacon for what the RPG genre is capable of achieving. For both veterans of the series and newcomers alike, this edition offers an experience that is both nostalgically familiar and exhilaratingly new. It is, without a doubt, an interstellar masterpiece worthy of every accolade.",1706366998,1706366998,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that out of the way i can share some thoughts on this game and try not to spoil anything in the process.
This game is a good example of how games should evolve with each new sequel in terms of gameplay and integration into story telling that immerses players into lore of its world, admittedly it is not a perfect game by a long shot, but still a damn good experience if one gives it a fair shot.
All three games make sure that every choice you make have some impact on you and for good or bad, you will ultimately see results of those in final iteration that will reflect all of decisions you made throughout your adventures. Storytelling is great and in some cases it will pit you with some really difficult choices to be made in order to accomplish your goal.

PROS:
- Great storytelling that gives a lot of insight into world of Mass Effect via Codex logs.
- Choices throughout all of games make impact both small or big and may involve death of your companions if you are reckless.
- Game does exceptionally good job at conveying horrors of massive scale wars and no matter how hard you try, not everyone can have a ""happy ending"" and you can only do so much to help those in need. This is motive is prominent in ME3 and showcases protagonist's mental state.
- Very memorable characters that you grow to like and each one of them have their own stories to tell if you invest enough time to learn about them and try not to get them killed in action.
- Decent roster of romancing options if one desires so.

CONS:
- Enemy AI sometimes make some hilarious decisions during combat (eg. enemy turn their backs and walk backwards as they rush your position)
- In ME1 this issue is most prominent... biotic enemies if in great numbers (saving grace not many instances throughout game) will spam crowd control ability that will keep you stunlocked with hardly much chance to get up and defend yourself, all the while rest of their squad will gun you down.
- At times game is not very clear with you as to how story progress locks and will keep you stuck into rails and that in turn will make some quests locked.
- ME1 and ME2 sprint mechanic is limited and poor Shepard is in terrible condition for prolonged jog.

In overall i enjoyed time playing this game and suffering some of choices i made in my own playthrough and would recommend this game to any fan of good storytelling and butt kicking.

The Mass Effect trilogy were some of the first games I played as a friend of mine recommended it as I love Star Wars and anything sci-fi. It's been months since i finished the trilogy and I still think about the story almost daily. I was so immersed and fell in love with the characters to the point I cried at the end. I spent an hour in character customisation and I literally made a log in my phone of all the quests so I could make sure I wouldn't miss anything. If I could erase my memory and play this trilogy for the first time again I would without hesitation.

----------------------------------------------
Overall|
I think the entire series for the story is a 10/10. Gameplay for the whole series would be a 6/10. Story and choices are fanatics and only get better toward the end of the series. However the first Mass Effect has very poor combat and Mass Effect 3 tends to have repetitive mission themes and or objectives.
----------------------------------------------
Mass Effect 1 Review | Overall: 6/10
Story 9/10 |
Not perfect because a lot of decisions don't feel like they matter yet.

Gameplay 4/10 |
Gameplay is very bad and feels very unresponsive when playing. Using abilities and controlling the battles feels extremely difficult.

Graphics 6/10 |
Lots of areas were very barren and didn't have much detail to be expected for an older title will not take away from the overall enjoyment of the game though.

Missions/Exploration 7/10 |
Exploration is massive with tons of planets to discover missions are well designed and feel good to play through. However, points are taken off because most planets feel extremely empty with almost nothing to discover.
----------------------------------------------
Mass Effect 2 Review | Overall: 10/10
Story 10/10 |
Very engaging and enjoyable to play through, very easy to get lost in the side missions and exploring the world because of the extreme amount of detail.

Gameplay 9/10 |
Gameplay is great, guns feel unique and different classes play much better general combat and movement mechanics. Much better than the first game.

Graphics 9/10 |
Not insane graphics by any means but a ton better than the first game. Environments have way more detail and exploring areas is fun.

Missions/Exploration 9/10 |
Missions are very well designed and you will get addicted. The main story and the side quest are just as interesting if not more interesting. Characters gain a lot more depth and are much more enjoyable to be around. Exploration takes a hit. There is much less to explore in terms of planets but Mission and Hub areas still provide a lot of areas to explore.
----------------------------------------------
Mass Effect 3
Story 9/10 |
Hard to tell what I was doing to affect outcomes. Overall still a great story.

Gameplay 9/10 |
Gameplay is on par with Mass Effect 2 with some slight improvements overall very good.

Graphics 9/10 |
Graphics are also on par with Mass Effect 2 with some slight improvements, more detail in some areas etc overall very good.

Missions/Exploration 7/10 |
Some Missions were very good and enjoyable to play through, however at one point some missions had the same objectives and it was so repetitive it was getting annoying to play through. Other missions are very well designed and very good. Hit or miss on the mission design. Overall good.

The combat on the other hand, definitely felt a bit dated.  While there is a rich amount of customization and weapons/abilities to level up, the combat itself lacks variety and depth. For example, there is virtually no difference between a body shot and a headshot. Most encounters basically have you hiding behind a wall, firing and moving on.  Combat  feels repetitive and ultimately serves as a means to progress the story.

There are a handful of hacking puzzles and driving section as well which help break up the combat.  The puzzles were actually fun and require a bit of trial and error.

The story, side quest content, and character development of your companions are still amazing all these years later, even compared to some of the more recent AAA releases. I think the companion loyalty missions in Mass Effect 2 stand out the most. That being said each game has many great moments that make it worth sticking through for. This is even more impactful if you play the games chronologically and import your character from one game to the next as some decisions you make in the first game will impact your experience in the second and even the third installment. This can vary from minor differences to major plot points.

Though obviously, the trilogy isn’t perfect. The combat, especially in ME1, can feel a bit outdated and annoying (the Mako sections come to mind), and the “one-button-does-everything” mechanic in the third game is frustrating as hell. Just let me sprint around and not pull me to every wall I run across like a magnet damnit! 

The quest log in ME3 is also a headache. Why do the missions not disappear off it if I can no longer complete them? And why is it more difficult to find out what you’re actually supposed to do or who to talk to concerning a quest? The first two games had the journal nailed down, so the change in ME3 seems inexplicable and pointless.

Finally, the ending of ME3 wasn’t all that great, but since pretty much everyone has complained about it already, I won’t elaborate too much. I just wish the choices you make throughout the three games could impact the ending in a more significant way as well as offer a more satisfying conclusion.

Again, all these criticisms don’t take away from the overall amazing experience that is the Mass Effect trilogy. And hell, if you don’t like something, you can bet there are mods to fix it - everything from textures and lighting to story and romance.

It’s also great that the Legendary Edition goes on sale quite often. I myself got it for €6, and can confidently say that those were the best €6 I’ve ever spent.",1705794206,1705837526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Mass Effect 1[/h3]
The one that began it all, and that’s a merit of its own - even with all the clunkiness and half-assed mechanics it may have. In this Legendary edition, ME1 is the oldest and, of course, has received the best uplift from its former self. The remastering work, in some fields, borders on the “remake”; the UI was completely reworked and modernized in comparison to the unwieldy, clunky disaster of the original. Everything feels smoother, more responsive, more fluid. The visual upgrades are impressive, and a far cry from the original in almost all aspects; however, this probably weighed more on its dated engine, and that’s the reason behind the sporadic crashes and frame-drops in specific areas. 

Gameplay–wise, an effort has been made to rebalance the economy, loot tables, weapons and enemy difficulty. On one side, this makes the early-to-mid game phases more challenging on higher difficulties, so much that you might get 1-shot but snipers and other shenanigans; on the other it makes late-game much more trivial compared to the original. This is mainly due to the massive power creep in both weapons and attachments, other than absurd amounts of money gained from sales, and imbalances in the XP gained from side missions, far more than it would be reasonable. Result: Shepard will become an unstoppable killing machine, capable of 1-shotting most enemies with heavier weapons and ragdoll the rest across the battlefield by sheer bullet impact force.

The controls, UI, movement and cover systems have been largely overhauled, a large improvement over the clunky mess that were the controls of the original ME1, as now they’re more similar to the far superior sequels in handling. For the rest, the game remains largely the same, including the tedious side-exploring of planets for collectibles or the time-consuming meandering through locations with dubious fast-travel solutions, if any. It’s a good RPG, but in my opinion the weakest of the trilogy gameplay-wise.

[h3]Mass Effect 2[/h3]
Considered by many, myself included, to be the overall apex of this trilogy, ME2 has undergone visible but comparatively-minor overhauls if compared to its older brother. The lighting solutions are markedly improved, same for textures and effects quality, overall offering a crispier visual fidelity, but not without downsides. The visible, annoying aliasing (jagged edges) can’t be countered very well by the shoddy anti-aliasing solution, so you’ll either have to live with it, or use GPU control panel fiddling or external mods (such as ReShade) to alleviate the problem. Moreover, roughly the same results, except for lighting, could be achieved with existing mods, like the popular “ALOT” to name one. Is the remaster version better? Yes, it is, but not without additional performance issues, especially at the Citadel.

The balance shenanigans of ME1 Remaster are fortunately gone, and the game offers a consistent, well-balanced challenge (unless you play on Insanity, which I did, and is pure pain) that you will enjoy. The story and character arcs of this second entry are the best in the trilogy; most people that aren’t my dead-inside self will become emotionally-invested in the characters and events surrounding Shepard’s space opera epic in saving the galaxy. 

Unfortunately, the devs didn’t want to alleviate the tremendous pain that is planet scanning, which will take literally dozens of hours to 100%, if you’re a completionist or, like me, an autist. Be prepared to put an anime on your second screen (if you don’t have a second screen, buy a cheap one) and scan endless planets for miserable resources and the occasional artifact collectible. You don’t have a choice anyway, if you want upgrades.

[h3]Mass Effect 3[/h3]
This last chapter is, of course, the one that benefitted less from the remaster, as it’s the most modern and, even in its original state, had pretty solid visuals. The remaster’s results are not as noticeable here. Barely any change was made to the gameplay, UI or balancing compared to the original release. Considered by many to be the worst entry of the series (except Andromeda, but we don’t speak about that one…), I don’t think it’s fair to say that, especially gameplay-wise. Sure, the story is a downgrade from ME2 and the ending a train wreck, but it has its great moments; its gameplay is hands down the best in the trilogy, by variety of weapons, builds, combat feel and mechanics. It’s still better than Mass Effect 1 as far as I’m concerned, and having played this trilogy four times in my life, I can tell.

It’s downright a shame that the fun, engaging, varied multiplayer of ME3 was mercilessly scrubbed away. It may have been infested by dumb microtransactions, it may not have been well-balanced, but with some friends or even randoms it was a blast, and had plenty of content not available in the main game, like being able to play as enemy characters with unique abilities, unlocking unique weapons, and even unique enemies like “upgraded” Collectors.",1705809340,1705809340,True,228,4,0.945726990699768066,11,True,False,False

The actual review:
The Mass Effect games are beloved by millions of people. Why? It can't be the gameplay, because it has aged horribly. Especially ME1 is janky as hell. Combat does get more interesting in the other episodes, but it's still mostly repetitive cover shooter nonsense. Tactical depth gets ruined by bullet sponge enemies and wonky squad AI. And don't get me started on the Mako in ME1 - this thing sucks, even in the remastered version. The hovercraft in ME2 is slightly better, but still far from being fun, especially because the missions you're using it in are extremely boring. (Go to objective -> shoot the baddies -> press button to do the thing -> rinse and repeat)

The mission design in general is very outdated. Almost every mission sends you down some kind of corridor. You go through doors, find some loot in adjacent rooms and as soon as you reach a larger room / open space, there's a combat encounter. The enemy AI doesn't flank or use terrain, it only knows three moves: duck for cover, stick out head to shoot, walk towards you. It was a good decision by BioWare to ditch the looter elements from ME1 in favor of a more streamlined shooter experience, but these games are mediocre shooters at best. ME3 has the best combat by far, but it's still not great. 

But let's be honest: Nobody plays these games for the combat. These games are all about the narrative. You're Shepard, the first human spectre - a spectre is basically space James Bond. Your goal is as simple as it is compelling: Defeat the Reapers, an ancient sentient machine species. The main plot moves at a snail's pace, but that's not a big issue, because the narrative focus lies on your companions. And that's where the trilogy is just excellent. Each character comes with a unique and (mostly) interesting personality. You really start to care about your rag tag group of misfits. Character deaths can happen and hit you like a truck. 

In many ways, the Mass Effect games offer typical post 9/11 storytelling. They're deeply rooted in that weird mix of angst and heroism which shaped the 2000s. The council (= space UN) is being portrayed as corrupt and incompetent, meanwhile the military mostly consists of heroes - some of them with tainted morality. Speaking of morality: The paragon / renegade system is a very light take on a morality system. It's mostly flavor and doesn't impact the game too much. It's still fun to punch journalists, though.

Visually, these games have aged surprisingly well. Character models still look nice and the environments are also cleverly designed. You have to remember the technical limitations of the consoles these games were developed for. That's also the main reason for all the corridors. On the flipside, the linear level design leads to a very fluid experience. There's no backtracking, you press forward, shoot stuff and progress. 

The sound design is also great. Each location comes with some nice ambience and the sound effects (weapons!) are also fantastic. And then there's the voice acting: It's nothing short of spectacular, especially if you consider when these games were released. The actress portraying Jane Shepard did an exceptional job.

Summary: Get the LE if you even remotely like sci-fi. It's still worth playing and there's nothing like it.

Ninety four hours. Moments that will stay with me forever.

We're very lucky to have this remaster, against all odds. I can attest to how unbelievably well written and delivered this epic truly is. It's crazy to think that all these years later nothing has really come close to it, certainly not in the realm of science fiction.

Exceptional story, voice talent and music, combined with some incredible cinematic moments have lifted this game to the highest peaks. Everything else, no matter how ho-hum and janky it might be, really doesn't matter at the end of the day. It goes to show how much exceptional narrative can carry a game even when the graphics and mechanics are outdated.

Speaking of graphics, while they may be outdated Bioware have done an incredible job squeezing a lot out of lighting and geometry to give you gorgeous vistas.

So when I say they make pretty much no sense when you actually think about them, I mean it from a place of love. Mass Effect 1's verisimilitude doesn't hang onto the next few games very well. Mass Effect 2 doesn't gel well with the overall plot cohesion at the best of times. Mass Effect 3 has the weakest writing in the series all throughout if you actually spare a thought or two. Some character arcs really don't make sense or can feel forced. Renegade and Paragon accidentally may pigeonhole the player into a single play style. Mass Effect is a really fun power fantasy. If you're looking for a more philosophical angle sci-fi is used for, this is not your game series even if Mass Effect 1 sets up that kind of tone with some of it's choices. The game is carried hard by presentation, intrigue, and characters that keep the player engaged and interested. For that it is one of the most beloved games I have ever seen.

The mouse acceleration feels a little off. The shine and flare added to the graphics can be too bright and blinding at times haha. AI can sometimes get a little bit silly as a treat. EA requires an online connection to play the game via their launcher. I'll still do it because the series is wonderful but that is not a positive. For people who have played Mass Effect I think 1 in particular has had a lot of positive changes from graphics to mechanics. For new players its convenient to have everything in one go as well.

Generic pro-tips for the interested:

-Paragon and Renegade are 'supposed' to be more than simply Good and Bad. Renegade in particular experiences a whiplash in meaning across the games. Experiment and find out whats fun for you

-Vanguard but truly any biotic-adjacent class tends to be fan favorites, mine is Engineer

-Try to go unspoiled for as long as possible. As an older game people have long since formed a generic 'best possible outcome' and it is copy and pasted absolutely everywhere. The game can always be replayed, and no set of outcomes is canon to you but yours(until another game releases and firms things up, of course)

-For returning players play something new. Mass Effect has quite a lot in it, go hit that Renegade option and see something new",1705709221,1705709320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

pros,
1. very interesting lore and story
2.your choices ACTUALLY matter unlike in modern bethesda games (i have over 1600 hours in fallout 4 so i would know)
3. interesting characters
4. you can punch a crooked reporter in the face
5. pretty sizable modding scene

Cons,
1. a little dated
2. 1 and 2 played out solid with no noticeable bugs for me but the 3rd game has a few noticeable bugs but nothing game breaking and most of the time kinda hilarious

i would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a meaningful story to play out and i will be making a few more runs before i move on.

You have to be online to play the game, and you are out of luck if you are planning to take the Steam Deck to an off grid area where the connection is impossible. 

I can play games like Max Payne 3 and Mortal Kombat X offline without any problems. Even Baldur's Gate 3 is offline friendly. EA needs to knock it off with that forced application because that practice is encouraging players to pirate, not stop piracy.

I will hold off on buying any EA games for the PC and will reconsider giving a thumbs up until EA makes a proper Offline mode or get rid of it for single player games like this and Star Wars Jedi Survivor.",1705468972,1705468972,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Mass Effect[/b]
This is probably the most underrated in the trilogy. It has the most memorable cast of characters and some amazing missions (and some pretty bland ones too). Even though this was the first one, for me, it was the hardest. The only time across the three games that I switched difficulty was in the final boss fight of this. Even though this is a really great game, it doesn't offer as much side content or areas to explore as Mass Effect 2 and 3. But by far where this trilogy shines is in its story. From the beginning it gives you just enough information to hook you and absorb you into its vast and lore-filled world. While in the middle there are some slightly boring missions, once you get to the end it pulls you back in and makes you want more. - 9.5/10

[b]Mass Effect 2[/b]
The game that many consider to be the best in the trilogy. At first, the beginning can be a bit jarring especially if you start this directly after completing Mass Effect 1. You're introduced to entirely new characters after spending many hours growing close to the characters from the previous game. Once you complete the prologue mission, you reunite with some old friends and meet some new ones too as you get back into things with another fantastic story. While it has the weakest beginning, it definitely as the strongest end. The [spoiler]suicide[/spoiler] mission is one of the best in the trilogy. This game also offers tons of new side content and new worlds to explore after a stressful mission. - 9.5/10

[b]Mass Effect 3[/b]
What I consider to be the most over hated, mainly because of the ending (which we'll talk about in a second). This game ties together everything you've experienced from the previous two games. And features so much side content that I didn't bother doing any of it because it felt like too much (and to be honest I only cared about the main story at this point). It starts out with high stakes and sets the tone immediately of a mission with little hope of success. As you progress you learn more and more about was is actually going on and how to stop the main threat of the trilogy. The final mission is one of the best in the series...until a certain point. Everything else about this game is amazing, but here is where everyone's gripes lie. The ending. This game has multiple endings that you can choose from, depending on choices you made over the course of the trilogy. However, some of the endings leave you feeling a bit unsatisfied by the end. They also added some unnecessary details at the last minute that I felt deterred a bit from what the game was initially about. I believe it should've had one ending, and one in particular that I won't say for spoiler purposes. Regardless, I don't think the somewhat lackluster ending is a reason not to play this game. Still amazing, start to (almost) finish. - 9/10

Overall, one of my personal favorite game trilogies of all time that fans of science fiction should give a try.

You are in for an awesome ride and will definitely have an exciting experience ahead of you. 

Now let's talk about what makes the franchise so awesome. The choices you have to make, the character building and the world you are thrown into. This is a true RPG, so playing as Shepard will let you decide on your own, what kind of person you want to be. Want to be a self centered, bad mannered and sneaky character? No problem. Want to be a kind, well mannered and courteous character? Also no problem. The possibilities are nearly endless but keep in mind that every path you choose, will have big consequences for yourself and even whole planets. Some of these consequences will also be very far reaching, so that a decision you took in the first Mass Effect will also have an impact in the last entry of the trilogy. 

The character writing is done very well and the crew of your starship will surely grow on you after a while. They have all different personality traits and interacting with their peculiarities is a big and very fun part of the experience. You can become their friends or foes and even begin a romance with them. They surely don't feel generic in any way. The worldbuilding and art style is top notch and is bursting with attention to detail. You will travel to vastly different planets which inhabitants will all have their own customs and manners. 

Another big role plays the combat. At the beginning, you can choose between different classes which will unlock different traits for the Commander. These will influence the gameplay in a lot of different ways, for example towards a more aggressive playstyle. Sadly, the weapon variety is rather limited and the shooting mechanics feel a little bit weak throughout all 3 titles. It's not unenjoyable by any means but there's a certain punch missing behind it. 

In revue, a great collection which offers a nice visual upgrade, better controls and a beautiful world that will suck you into itself. All the DLC are already included which is a pretty neat thing, also thanks to their high quality. Just buy it, you surely won't regret it.

So far this is very engaging.  So many games do sci-fi wrong...but this is better than most modern releases.

Excellent story, atmosphere, and characters.  

Unfortunately, the EA launcher is a nuisance.  I may uninstall and not finish specifically because of the intrusiveness of the launcher.  But the games themselves are surprisingly good...especially compared to modern titles.

The current EA app does still have to launch to play the game, which means that you will have to be online to play. This isn't a deal breaker for me - many modern games require an online connection to play - but it could definitely turn people off.

I've played this trilogy since the release of the OG Mass Effect - hundreds of hours across various platforms - and it is my favorite gaming experience of all time. The sci-fi world building is top notch, the voice acting is phenomenal, the gameplay - while wonky in the first game - is fun, and the relationships that you will build with your crew are among the best that video games have to offer. By the end of the trilogy, other story-focused RPGs will feel shallow in comparison.

The Legendary Edition on PC is the definitive way to play the trilogy with one important caveat. After you install this game, go to Nexus Mods and download ME3 Tweaks Mod Manager. Then install - at the very least - the Patch and Community Framework for ME1 and ME3 and the Unofficial Patch for ME2. These patches don't change the core experience of the trilogy, but they create an experience that is fuller and more coherent. There are some bugs in the base game that carried over from the Original Trilogy - and there are some that didn't exist in the OT that made it into the LE. The mod patches smooth those out and restore some cut content that polishes up what is already an incredible experience.

 Well here comes the reasons i can't recommend it. mass effect two throws all that away and replaces it with generic cover shooter nonsense, they massively improved the interpersonal interactions with characters but that's the only thing i can say about it positively. You can no longer heal when you wish you heal when you are sufficiently hidden and not being shot, enemies have pinpoint accuracy and deathly damage, meaning if you don't play it like a cod clone from 2006 you will die, biotics were nerfed to the point of uselessness; if your enemy has shields or armor they are immune to biotics full stop until you remove them, and at that point they are close enough to death that you could finish them off with a single shot from the weakest weapon in the game. They removed the most unique thing mass effect had, a heat meter; every weapon in mass effect 1 had a meter that increased as you fired it and if it maxed out your weapon would overheat and be unusable until the bar went all the way back down, this prevented you from going ham, and increased your propensity for being smart about modding the weapon, and making you remember to use powers, they replaced this with a heatsink clip system that is ammunition with a different name, this not only removes the most unique system mass effect had, it also makes no sense lorewise, as whats the point of having a massive block of metal that the gun shaves off pieces of and basically magnetically accelerates so that you never have to reload, and then inventing a new way that you need to reload? at that point just switch back to bullets. the story mass effect 2 has decided that the reapers need to have little helpers in the galaxy that we have never heard of until this point gone is the eldrich unknowable origins and motives of the reapers they decided to explain it and the explanation is stupid. i won't spoil it for you look it up or play the game. 

they improved interactions with other characters, which is good because the game is mostly about collecting squad mates, its still unclear which dialog choices are going to be flirting, speaking of interactions they added quicktime event, i hate quicktime events, but that's an opinion, here's a fact the quick time events are exclusively outside of combat, whether that's in dialogue or a cutscene taking place right after dialogue, the quicktime events only take place when you are expecting you should be able to relax a little.

additionally all maps are extremely linear it's hallways to hallways to hallways to goal, they dress it up nice with little alcoves, and set dressing, and shortcuts that are exactly as long as the normal path but it's really just a fancy hallway. speaking of maps there isn't one mass effect 1 had a fantastic map system, every level, hub, and planet had a map, they had labels, and the direction you were facing and points of interest marked. me2 has a compass, a compass that pretty much only points to the final objective so if you need to find a key or a bomb to open the door to the final objective? ""figure it out dip shit"" says the game. which wouldn't be so bad if every hallway didn't look exactly the same and was lit even the slightest bit better, alas you will be walking around in circles.

all in all if you don't like COD clones get it on sale like i did, i can't really speak on me3 because i gave up halfway through me2, funny i've never actually hated a game before, i guess me1 just raised my expections too high. it's funny i beat me1 on hard core but i was barely scraping by me2 on casual it was a truely miserable experience. have i mentiond i don't like cover shooters? it's very antithetical to my playstyle, i ether like to run around like a mad man hitting people with a machinegun on the driveby like in doom, or hide where no one can see me and line up the perfect shot with a sniper or bow like in dishonored, in mass effect i could do both of those things as i chose depending on how i speced my shepard, in mass effect 2 you can do neither, you will play like a cover shooter from the early 2000's or you will suffer (and suffer in my case) from research i've found that mass effect 3 is a lot more like me2 than me1 so i'm done with legendary edition unless someon is crazy enough to make a mod that somehow makes me2 and 3 play like me1",1705328430,1705328430,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

It offers a substantial upgrade over the original trilogy in terms of visual improvements,this compilation also includes almost all single-player downloadable content that was originally released for each game.
The original game also received a significant amount of gameplay updates, which was done in order to modernize the experience and to remove inconsistencies with its sequels.

Patience is the key to unveil one of the best story in video game industry. Don't rush it ,don't skip dialogues and codex entries if you want the best experience. 

You can expect around 40 to 50 hours per game,so we're looking at 150-200 hours if you decide to go for achievements. Oh and if you decide to make a female Shepard and play again do it,because personally i think the female Shepard voice actor is so much better than his male counterpart. If you get in on sale ,thats a steal.

Pros:
-3 remastered games in 1
-one of the best story ever
-companions and Bioware morality system
-universe exploration
-graphics: it's a blend of old and new that look amazing! 
-choices matter,everything you do have consequences sooner or later 
-fps with rpg elements

Cons:

The game can be a bit buggy at times, particularly if you're an achievement hunter aiming to conquer it on insanity mode. This difficulty level feels somewhat unfair; enemies turn into bullet sponges, and they'll take you down even when you're in cover.

In ME3, using Lift and not attacking the enemy with any other power will cause them to be locked into a falling animation when they hit the ground, meaning you are soft-locked or have to back-track to where they fell and kill them again.

Okay, I'm going to start this review off with some information real quick. I never played Mass Effect back when it was still current. I still didn't until recently because it was two things I thought I disliked. Third-person shooter, and sci-fi space-y stuff. Those are two things I generally just dislike... however, when I started to play this game, I quickly realised I made a massive mistake. That mistake being that I didn't play these games sooner. Holy fuck, these games are the best games I've played in years. Almost a decade, they are that good.

Here are some pros:
- The combat across all three games is definitely pretty good. I don't think it really has many downfalls. Even if it does, they are downfalls of the games being as old as they are. I found the combat to be satisfying and fun across all three games.
- The sound design is really good, I didn't notice any moments where I really felt the sound was lacking or too much at any point. Generally, it's pretty damn good.
- This is kind of an extension of the ""sound design"" point, but for the most part... holy crap the voice acting in all three games is good. The characters sounded believable, and they conveyed the emotions they were meant to convey... except for ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION. 
- The characters... oh, the characters. Holy shit, this is some of the best character writing I've witnessed in a long time. Possibly just my opinion, but I LOVE the character writing in all three games. I sympathised with characters when I was meant to sympathise with them, I felt sad when bad things happened to people I cared about, I felt angry when characters did awful things, I genuinely fell for the romance partner I picked in real life a little bit (I chose Tali'Zorah. Tali'Zorah supremacy gang), I genuinely cared for the characters that cared for me... it's just so fucking masterfully done. The characters FEEL like real people, and that's harder to do than you'd think it is.
- The writing in general I'd say is really damn good, the story is interesting and engaging, the character motivations, desires, actions and all that are all believable and make sense. I genuinely think this is some of the best story writing in a game I've played in a while.
- This could be a con depending on how you swing, but this game PULLS NO PUNCHES. You can legitimately get people killed if you don't do things right... even your squad mates. Granted, it's only at certain, specific spots throughout the games, but you genuinely have to be worried about killing people you care about. I was so invested into these characters that I used a walkthrough to MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE everyone survived, and I succeeded. I didn't want to see anyone die. For example, in Mass Effect 3, in order to get the best ending where everyone survives, you are REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE GAME to make sure everyone gets out alive. Your actions have consequences. Pick them carefully.
- The abilities of the characters made complete sense and were very useful in combat. You can swap your ammo types to do more damage against synthetic enemies, or organic enemies, or slow enemies down, or any wide variety of other things. You also have lots of abilities to play with like combat drones, slowing down time, lifting enemies helplessly up into the air... there's a lot of stuff to play with in these games, and I loved it all.
- The missions were never boring, honestly. While I was playing I never found myself wishing a mission was over, they were fun and they ended before they had a chance to get boring, which is always a good thing.
- The weapon selection across all three games is pretty good, I didn't really have a complaint about that at all. There was a weapon for every play style I could've thought of, and that's a good thing.

Here are some cons:
- Mentioned it before in the ""pros"" section, but honestly Male Shepard's voice actor is just not good. He just sounds like he's trying too hard to seem cool, and he sounds completely emotionless. Female Shepard's voice is so, so much better, but then you're unable to romance some characters. Characters DO have preferences in this game!
- They are all old games, so they come with their ""old game problems"". The movement engine in all three games is a bit wonky and janky. I found myself getting annoyed with the movement engine in ME3 every once in a while because sometimes I'll be sprinting past a wall and Shepard will just magnetise to it and take cover on it, getting me shot a few times in the process.
- There are some bad bugs that STILL exist in these games to this day. There's a few bugs in ME3 where some missions will just straight-up break and be impossible to complete if you do certain things. None of the missions that break in this way are main story missions or missions that are required to get the best ending, but it's still pretty annoying that some of the missions are straight-up impossible to complete if you do certain things that a player might just do absentmindedly.
- I had this consistent problem across all three games with the dialogue, it's a similar issue that goes on with Fallout 4. What some dialogue options are labelled as feels completely different to what you end up saying. You might select an option for Shepard to say that seems like a decent thing to say, then he/she suddenly snips at the character in a way you didn't expect. Like... what? I was just trying to tell the character I'm talking to that we don't have time to ask this other character questions, I wasn't trying to be sarcastic and rude! There were genuinely a few times where I reloaded a save because I felt annoyed with the dialogue choice I made that ended up not being what I thought it would be.
- I wouldn't say this is an objectively bad thing, but Mass Effect 3 took itself a lot less seriously than the previous two games did. There were constantly jokes and quips going on in Mass Effect 3. A lot of it was funny, but there genuinely were moments where I was like ""Okay, stop. I'm trying to take this game seriously, and you're making it difficult"". It might be something you actually LIKE, but I personally thought the game was at its best when it was serious and dark.
- This is a minor gripe, but it felt like Mass Effect 3 removed some things that were actually good in the previous games. For example, In the first two Mass Effect games, when you were doing a mission, it would give you updated information in your mission log about what you were doing, and what you need to do next in the mission. In Mass Effect 3, that's COMPLETELY gone. The only information you get is the overarching synopsis of the mission, that's it. Figure out what you have to do next yourself. What if you took a break from the game for a few weeks and now don't remember what it is you were doing? Too bad, you'll have to look up a walkthrough to see where you have to go next! It's genuinely pretty annoying.
- The U.I is honestly pretty horrid. Especially the combat U.I. In order to switch weapons, you have to hold a certain button, move your mouse down to the ""weapons"" section, click the weapon you want to use, and then let go of that button. It's really just not good at all.

TL;DR: The Mass Effect series is a series I skipped for a while for various reasons, and after playing the games included in this collection... I regret having skipped it for so long. I now understand why this series is a cult classic and I highly recommend anyone who's at least vaguely interested in the series to try it. You may be pleasantly surprised. All three games are absolutely fucking fantastic - and while they have their issues at times - I think these three games are some of the best games I've played in a good few years. I'm literally trying to find one of those little statues of Tali'Zorah as I write this because I love her character so much, best character I've seen in a video game in years.

Only negative I'd give this collection is the Origin Client from EA or what ever they are calling it these days. It was annoying with ME3 when it released and its still annoying today. It's the only thing keeping the steam deck experience from being a chef's kiss for the ME fan looking to take the trilogy on the go.

- Although the AI should be improved, this is not very noticeable (especially ME1)
- Unfortunate, no multiplayer (there was one in ME3). It was really fun at the time :(
- Pinnacle Station DLC is missing

OK, they're not really my friends; claiming to be buddies with imaginary characters is a little too geeky even for me. The Mass Effect series is not without its flaws, and some are truly Reaper-sized. But it has gripped me like nothing else in the history of video games, and video games and I go back a pretty long way (but I'll never be too old for video games)!

The Mass Effect universe is that rare thing—a fully-realized science fiction game setting that stands up to the likes of Star Trek or Star Wars. The universe in which the games take place has a rich and complex backstory, and even better, it's not a rich and complex back story that the player has to have info-dumped into his head. This isn't The Old Republic, where you have to read thousands of awful Kevin J. Anderson ""Extended Universe"" novels and have a working knowledge of the seven prime forms of lightsaber combat to get the most out of the game.

There's depth in the backstory, but it's not the kind of depth that ever compelled me to memorize the game's codex entries. (Do you really need to know that the ""First Contact War"" between humans and Turians started because humans activated a mass relay in violation of council law and that the war culminated in the siege of Shanxi? No. It's wonderful flavor, but it's not mandatory knowledge.) The world is alive and compellingly real just through dialogue and character actions, without needing endless narration. The first game's opening title crawl essentially says, ""This is the future and aliens are real and you are a space soldier. Go."" That's enough.

Instead of a galactic civics lesson, Mass Effect focuses on a human, the forever-first-nameless Commander Shepard, and her fight against the ancient Reapers, an enemy that aims to rid the galaxy of advanced sentient life for a whole bunch of really complicated reasons. That fight is the central focus of all three games, though Shepard's path from soldier to savior twists and turns and doubles back on itself like a demented snake.",1703838913,1705048085,True,1,0,0.514285683631896973,0,True,False,False

This is by far the longest review for a steam product I can give (it's 3 games worth of content), and I feel like i need to give some background. I grew up with BioWare games, I started with Dragon Age Origins back in 2009 and have played a good deal of their catalog, I've gone through Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, Kotor and SW:TOR, played through all the dragon age games and their dlc, went through their first original title in Jade Empire. However Mass Effect has been a blind spot for me, I've played 2 quite a bit growing up, but never really touched 1 or 3 at all prior to this playthrough. My opinion on the series due to that is a bit different from those that did go through it at the time of release and grew up with it. In this review I'm gonna be singing the games up and saying some contentious things, I don't think it's the best thing the studio has made, but before I get to that I will say I do overall recommend the series and this game. It's by far the most ambitious thing BioWare has ever done, but with ambition comes varying degrees of quality.

Also should mention for this playthrough I went with a Paragon Male Shepard, class was Vanguard
[h2] General Praise and Criticisms [/h2]

First bit of praise I can give is that there is no other game series like this. Mass Effect as a universe is one of the most unique video game settings out there and for the most part that setting feels huge and unique. Every alien race you come across has something going on and especially in Mass Effect 1 the focus that is given to them makes it genuinely immersive and interesting to learn about all these different races, their cultures, attitudes toward humans and why they hold them, and the political backdrop the galaxy is in when Shepard comes into play. However, I do think they dropped the ball a bit on the setting with the focus humanity takes from Mass Effect 2 onwards, it feels like from that point on the other races only exist to stall and thwart humanity when in the first game it comes off as much more complex than that. The villains also just get worse with every entry. Saren was a great villain, the collectors were bland and harbinger is an annoying joke, and the Reapers went from being a cosmic horror threat to a more powerful version of the Borg in TNG. I will not even mention Kai Leng other than to say yeah.....he's really bad.

Another bit of praise i can give is that the characters throughout the series are fantastically written. Garrus and Mordin are probably the best written characters Bioware has ever made and for the most part every other character is well written. I did not even mind Kaiden or Jacob like a lot people seem to. They're a bit generic, but they both still have something going on and provide good worldbuilding for humanity.

[h2] Mass Effect 1 [/h2] (8.5/10)

This is by far my favorite entry in the series, it is a great introduction to the universe and it feels the most grand. The writing is a good mix of serious sci-fi and humorous interactions between characters, and the gameplay is more rooted in rpg gameplay compared to the rest of the series, but the combat has aged the worst, and other than changing the aiming mechanics and the mako (which i do like, bite me), the remaster does little to update the moment to moment gameplay, it just makes it easier. If you can look past some aged mechanics though it's one of the best games BioWare has ever made. It's atmospheric, immersive, and grounded in a way the other games aren't which makes it stand out even among other rpgs besides it sequels.

[h2] Mass Effect 2 [/h2] (7/10)

This is a hard one to review. I've never played a game that has has so much stellar content and so much bad content. I will say that overall it is still very much worth playing with some caveats. The gameplay is improved and the removal of some of the rpg mechanics went ok in my book (minus how they made certain classes like vanguard underpowered cause not enough people choose that class i guess), and like with the first game the cast of characters is still great, I would actually say the cast in 2 is the best in the series which is why it has the reputation it has. The focus on the game is on the casts loyalty and recruitment missions, which are all either great or a bit mid (jack and samara's missions were eh, and some of the recruitment missions themselves are a bit repetitive). The problem comes in with the main story, it doesn't make sense, doesn't move the plot forward and a lot of the missions are just boring shooting galleries that take way too long to complete. At least there's only 4 main missions but each one is a slog other than the final mission which is actually really good. The Illusive Man on the surface is pretty interesting, but if you think about him for more than 5 minutes his knowledge of the collectors and how things play out is ridiculous. I won't say hes a totally bad character, his motivations make sense and he's compelling, just a bit unbelievable at times how he's able to predict how everything goes. The worst part about this game is the grinding for the final mission, you gotta do every loyalty mission and upgrade every part of the ship which you do by going to different planets and scanning for resources and shooting probes. It's fun for the first hour sure, and the music is chill, but for like 5 or 6 hours, it's just boring and slows the game down to a halt.

[h2] Mass Effect 3 [/h2] (5.5/10)

I can't say much about this game. It's just a chore sometimes. Every good part of the game narratively owes it's success to the first game, and it still messes things up, it turns the geth who are a hivemind who want to remain a hivemind machines that want individuality, which spits in the face of what Legion in ME2 has to say, it's just a bad retcon that turns a genuinely unique take on ai and turns them into Commander Data. The genophage plot was the peak of the game, and all the dlc is good which is why i added an extra half point but the majority of the game doesn't even feel like it has any rpg elements in it anymore, those two plots i brought up, yeah they're the only times you get to make any meaningful choices. Companions are still good but theres very little focus on them at all other than half-baked callbacks. The gameplay is pretty good, but it overstays it's welcome, I said 4 missions on ME2 were bloated, every mission in 3 you take out at least 150-200 enemies at once, and some of them take place in what i can only assume were multiplayer maps. That scanning minigame, it's worse here if you want to get the ""good"" ending. I'm complaining a lot about this game, but i still came back and kept playing so it's doing something right, i just can't put my finger on it. Overall it does close some plots and character arcs well, but the first two games are so above and beyond better that it just isn't worth playing even as just a run of the mill third person shooter unless you have played the other games, which isn't something i'd say about 2 which can be played and enjoyed standalone, and the finale is just anticlimactic given everything that led up to that point.

[h2] Final thoughts [/h2]

Overall I think Mass Effect is a mess, at times an absolute masterpiece in video game storytelling but still a mess. The best indicator of a good rpg is if after beating it you could see yourself playing it again, and I'll say I will eventually. It does too much right to not justify another playthrough and even though it got frustrating near the end, The good outweighs the bad with the series. The setting is great, the characters are great, most of the writing is great and it just has that BioWare charm to it. I would say with a good discount it's worth anyone's time. Just don't expect the uber AAA masterpiece people have built it up as and you'll have a good time overall.",1705002866,1705003676,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

There are a number of improvements over the original games; all the DLC is included (minus Pinnacle Station, but that wasn't in the PS3 version either), lot's of QoL additions, many bug-fixes,, drastically improved graphics, and the Infiltrator is an actually usable class in the first game now. It's also worth mentioning that it runs extremely well on Linux; I never had any frame drops or stuttering.

There are still flaws of course,  It still has a decent amount of bugs, very few graphics options,  bloom that seems to be hard-coded in, and some more small things that I can't really be bothered to list. [strike]However, the biggest issue is the EA App. In a nutshell it breaks achievements in the 2nd and 3rd games; unless you set it to offline mode.[/strike] If it loses connection mid-mission it may prevent you from getting said mission's achievement unless you restart it. It happened to me right at the end of the Citadel DLC.

EA App and Legendary Edition aside, the actual games are truly amazing. Each of them are very different from the others in terms of gameplay. Mass Effect is very much a 2000's BioWare RPG. Mass Effect 2 is still an RPG, but with more action-adventure elements and a less comprehensive skill tree.  Mass Effect 3 is basically an action adventure game with skill points; not in a bad way though.

The overall story throughout the trilogy is solid and they all mesh very well together and they're well written. My only real complaint about the story is of that most of the (once) DLCs' don't really fit too well. they're just kinda thrown in there. Don't get me wrong, they're still good, they just stick out.

Despite it's flaws, Mass Effect :Legendary Edition is very good, and I highly recommend it.

- I will ALWAYS downvote any game that requires a 3rd party install no matter how good the game otherwise is. Its the principal of the matter. I bought the game on steam, it should only require steam. Especially if the other app is going to F*ck!ng spy on me. (Make sure to disable reporting etc. in the games menu)

Overall:
- Solid game series. Highly recommend. I am mostly downvoting for the 3rd party thing. 
- I will not be commenting on the plot itself. I personally was satisfied across the board in that regard, but I understand why some people would not be.",1704904274,1704904274,False,2,0,0.515017688274383545,0,True,False,False

This remaster doesn't even give us any neat quality of life changes! And it doesn't even stay 100% faithful to the original game either so you know DAMN well they could've changed things. 

I mean, view bobbing? Low FOV? Unskippable cutscenes when you travel to a planet (at least for the first game, haven't checked the 2nd/third one yet)? A fucking LAUNCHER that lets you choose which of the three games to boot up (rather than just giving you steam launch options and not making you wait for the damn launcher to boot up)?

(another thing that ticks me off is that the settings only allow you to change your mouse sensitivity in increments of 10, which is ridiculous)

Sure you can mod some QoL things into the game (still can't find a mod to remove view bobbing when you sprint from mass effect 1 though), but this is fucking EA! One of the richest companies in the gaming industry!

The only good thing about this remaster existing is that now you can get the entire trilogy for cheaper.

For everyone else who doesn't care about the remaster itself and just wants to know how good the original trilogy is, the games themselves are great story-wise, but the gameplay can be a total slog. Don't expect a fun challenge or too engaging gameplay. 

Maybe it's just because I'm in the middle of replaying the first game to refresh my memory but this game could definitely have done better in the gameplay department and the lackluster loot. The idea of having AI teammates that you can command in real time is cool but the AI literally refused to follow me into a room one time and the game isn't really difficult enough to really make you think too hard about it besides ""okay I guess I'll just sit behind this cover while making Garrus blow up their guns"".

Only played through the 1st game so far (I've played the second game before and I think it was at least SOMEWHAT better than ME2 all things considered, but I wouldn't know because for some reason ME2 didn't let me load my old save file for some reason) so I've only talked about that game in this review, but I hope anyone that was going into this game expecting a 100% immersive experience that'll blow your socks off is at least more realistic now.

I love the stories of these games a lot so I want to recommend it, but my god the gameplay sucks. I'd have to give gameplay a 7/10 for the combat and exploration at least being functional and not being frustrating but it's like eating a nice meal that's hard to swallow. It's neat, but dammit I wish it were better.

The lore in this is very rich, the combat is solid and somewhat strategic (not a fan of third-person shooters but here it works pretty well), levels are simple but well designed, and the voice acting is over hundreds and hundreds of hours and very professional and believable. IMPRESSIVE! Characters are VERY VERY likeable and interesting. There are dozens of characters I'll never forget in this. Another good point is that you can really feel how the games developed and evolved through the years (the first one is amazingly from 2007), and also your choices carry on cleverly from game to game. BTW there are hundreds of different ramifications to the story according to the paths you choose. One can say that the 3 games are different but all 3 keep the feeling, environment, and original tone of the series. The way relationships develop within the game is also something simple but very effective. You can have romances and even sex with some characters, and theses change things a lot in the game. A fantastic ride specially if you like space operas.

Things that are kinda annoying:
- Vehicles sections and mini-games terminals hacking parts in ME1 and ME2, thankfully all removed from ME3.
- The inability to take on and do some missions, or finish some quests because you did others before without knowing the games would completely block you from access some missions that were on your list. Kinda lame.
- ME3 could clarify a little more which weapon is of which type. I.e. Some look like a SMG but there is no way to tell they are actually shotguns or even assault rifles.

To me, gaming doesn't get better than this. It's rare that a game provokes meaningful thought, or connects you so deeply with a cast of characters. It's done here in a way that cannot be described as anything but masterful. 

The gameplay evolved significantly over the course of the trilogy, and you can still feel the differences between ME1/ME2/ME3 here in the legendary edition. However, the combat has been improved for all games, especially ME1. The improved models and textures are also something to behold, so incredibly improved from the original. It definitely helped with the immersion, as does ultrawide support. Also, the addition of all DLC with this package is the icing on the cake. It was almost surreal going back through and experiencing things I never had the chance to with the originals, it was like playing it for the first time all over again.

The game does have its issues, even still to this day in the legendary edition. But those small issues are so easy overlooked by the ambition and execution of this game.

First game is a chore to do as it's old and the gameplay is stiff.

The gameplay in ME1 is so outdated that I think it born that way, and the mission journal is a pain (which is not very improved in the next two games) but the story and characters are very good. 
The ME2 is overall the best in the trilogy, it can be a standalone game as ME1 is, the best char roster by far, and the story is very good.
ME3 has epic moments, and it's probably the most enjoyable ONLY if you played the other two and carried a save. Shame on you EA, the DLCs are too important to miss in ME3.

Story is engaging and unforgettable.
Some of the most well written believable characters ever to grace gaming.
Jaw dropping incredible cut scenes. 
A banging sound track across the trilogy, worthy of being a saved playlist on Spotify for quick listening.
Now is it perfect? probably not, but my God man It embodies everything great about gaming!
Combat can be a bit hit or miss, but still gripping and satisfying.
All topped with just the right amount of cheese to add to the charm. The fun campy cheese of the OG Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy without being overtly comedic.
Mass Effect is one of those  trilogies where every few years it hits you with the thought of ""dang some ME would be great about now."" that thought sticks in your brain like an itch you can't get rid of. You try ignoring for a while, but you know deep in the back of your brain it gnaws away like an incurable addiction, then right as those thoughts start to subside BAM!!!!!!!! YouTube or Spotify reminds you ""You like Mass Effect?"" 
Without a second thought you clear space in your hard drive, move files around, and scroll down to ME in your Steam library and hit that blue install button like your life depends on it!
If you've played ME before you know it, we all know it!

Good mix of different game-play types, from running round solving problems, combat, driving round different terrains, and of course building skills and tech/upgrades to assist with all the above.

The only think I would say is that there are some bits of the game I haven't fully managed to get my head round.

Mass Effect 2 is by far the most engaging out of the 3 with considerably better gameplay, and arguably better writing ( the companions are definitely best written in this game) And it isnt a total slog to get an ending that you would want. Mass Effect 3 while having the best gameplay in the series (not even nearly as much of a leap in quality from 1-2 though) is just a total drag and I won't force myself to go though the monotony that is War Assets just to get the ending I would want. The writing is by far the weakest in the series here with poorly resolved character arcs (Ashley) and I won't even begin to talk about the endings, no need to beat a dead horse we get it the endings are bad.

My favourite was ME1 in terms of the story, but mechanically its the most clunky and dated. Each subsequent game improves on gameplay until, by the third, it is really mechanically solid.

Unlike most people, ME2 was my least favourite of the 3. Mostly because it just feels like a side story that ignored nearly everything from the first game. Playing the games back to back makes the story shift much easier to stomach. For that reason I saw ME2 much more positively this time around.

I really enjoyed ME3, even at launch and was one of the few people that didn't mind the way that it ended. I feel much the same way, perhaps even more positive about it with some distance since my first play through.

This is a phenomenal trilogy of games (I recommend skipping ME:Andromeda), made better with the Legendary Edition. This is an easy recommendation.

Controls are janky though, with a very low FOV.

I assume this was acceptable on console with controllers, but on pc using kb/m the game doesn't feel nice to run around or shoot.

The best of Mass Effect 1 is the scale of the universe. Although the game is dated, it still holds up fine, especially when looking at the citadel, my absolute favorite place in the first game. The characters feel a little shallow in the first game, but you can see the potential of them. 
Mass Effect 2 fleshes those characters out a lot more, and gives you a lot more to love. The environments feel a bit more enclosed and don't feel as grand. There are still plenty of nice and detailed places to visit though, and the ending of this game is the best one in the series in my opinion. 
Mass Effect 3 gave me everything I wanted out of the characters I learned to love. The interactions with them are the absolute best part of this game, hands down. The environments feel more open again, more like they did in ME1. The DLC is really good, and feels like a breath of fresh air. It would have been my favorite out of the three, if not for the ending. It felt lackluster and detached and was not up to par with the quality of the rest of the game. 

It is however an amazing game, and I can't help but miss the characters that I spent al those hours with. None of three games are bad, and everyone should play this game. There is just so much to love.",1704372851,1704372851,True,0,0,0.486111104488372803,0,True,False,False

It's amazing. But like the Sopranos don't pay attention to the ending. 

This game became the standard of what I expect from RPG story telling back when I played for the first time on the xbox in ye old times. 

The world is very Lore Rich, the voice acting was ahead of it's time, while there isn't as much LGBTQ+ rep as the Dev's want - it still is very much there and for the time was groundbreaking. Even the combat in ME3 still feels good - 1 and 2 can easily be helped with mods that are simple and straight forward to use.  The Legendary Edition really just polished up the first two games to make them a little better to play on modern systems.

There is still an active and vibrant community around this game, so if you are questioning getting this because when you inevitably get sucked into this amazing world you are afraid because it's such an old game there is no community left to join to spew all your thoughts and theories... there very much is and the ME community is alive and well.

Now with the benefit of ten years behind me, I can safely say that all those fond memories were not *entirely* a product of some big new RPG on the scene but created with the help of a setting and system that by and large really doesn't have a good analogue to modern games.  While a lot can be said about 'choices' and 'consequences' that ULTIMATELY don't matter too much, there hasn't been anything quite like Mass Effect released that drags some of these decisions out quite a ways and making them feel not entirely like a case of planting 'member berries for future harvest.

The Legendary Edition changes are, by and large, positive. I think that the balance of ME1 in particular runs into a strange issue of just how lightning fast it is to level up and max out abilities and get all kinds of sweet gear which can trivialize encounters but 2 and 3 still manage to maintain pace well enough. There isn't really a graphical overhaul to speak of - just updates that bring the first two games more in line with the style of 3 - and sadly the multiplayer component (which was genuinely a blast) is not present here.  I would argue that the games are a little easier due to some rebalancing but Hardcore and Insanity remain plenty lethal.

Overall LE is well worth the money on sale for nothing if not a consolidated experience but it still has plenty going for it all the same.",1704151268,1704151268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the main story is great. Mass Effect 2 is the GOAT. I love everything about this game. Mass Effect 3 takes that great changes from Mass Effect 2 and carry it forward and improve on it.

This is a game where your decisions truly matter, with a colorful cast of characters you'll quickly become attached to, and a world that's a joy to immerse yourself in. There's no shortage of things to do in this trilogy if you explore it.

The games aren't perfect, of course. The controls of the first game feel a bit dated, the first games side missions can get repetitive, and there are other minor issues, like the occasional bug or mission pacing.

ME2 had a good balance for Casual players but obliterated RPG core elements from the series, while 3 was just a catastrophe at it's time (slightly ""fixed"" by patching and DLC - it's still the result of incompetence from Lead Game Design)

It was one of the first games I had ever played. The characters felt memorable and alive with their own little quirks. The story felt compelling and threaded together wonderfully over the series to lead up to a grand finale. There was one little agony however. For a certain reason, I never got to finish it. That gnawed at me for years, until, like everything else in life, that memory got lost in time. 

Fast forward 10 years and I am presented with the ""Legendary Edition"". Those repressed and forgotten memories from my early childhood got unearthed. I wanted to travel the stars again. Liara, Ashley, Garrus, Tali, Joker and the rest of the Normandy crew over the entire saga -- I wanted to meet them again. I wanted to go adventuring with them again, as a band of swashbuckling intergalactic space knights. 

I wanted to look them in the eye and ask, ""Do you remember me my friends? It has been so long, yet I have not forgotten you."" 

This game helped me go back in time to my childhood and finish an unfinished tale. I won't spoil it for you but I did what the game might call the ""perfect ending"" and even then, the ending felt poignant and made me keep wanting for more.

Thank You BioWare for coming up with this timeless classic. I shall cherish it forever. And keep hoping that one day I might get to see all of them again. To see the Normandy soar through the galaxies. To see Commander Shepard again!

What I got was one of the best stories I've ever experienced in a videogame. Mass Effect tells a story of galactic scale, yet never fails to focus on the individuals that move the story forward. You will grow attached to the cast of characters that inhabit the galaxy. That's not to say the galaxy itself is underdeveloped, though. There's worldbuilding galore and codex entries for you to peruse as you make your way through the games. A galaxy filled with life needs to be filled, well, with life. There are so many societies that exist in the universe and although you only meet a fraction of them, the ones you do paint a picture of a living, breathing, interstellar world, filled with stories waiting for you to play your role in. 

Mass Effect is an incredible tale in a fascinating setting. If you're a fan of sci-fi and looking for an enticing plot, then you will love it.

I will leave my previous review as is, and I'll add the update in a separate segment:

***Previous Review***
My goodness, this game is not how I remembered it in my teen years:

Now that I'm playing this on mouse and keyboard, I've noticed that Mass Effect 1 is incredibly easier than it should be, even on higher difficulty due to aiming the cursor with a mouse and the fact that there's infinite ammo... I could've sworn that the writing was a bit more cohesive and absent from plot holes. But, it left an impression where the principles to defeat a great evil wasn't strewn together well, and important characters who could've raised awareness had conflicting motives (either that, or they weren't cut out for their job as a galactic counselor).

Despite these set-backs, I really find Turians--and on especially rare occasions, Quarians--to be kinda attractive. The majority of these characters are very quirky and lack the depth // narrative that I was hoping to expect from Bioware. Nonetheless, my nostalgia reigns supreme and I can't stop expressing excessive sympathy and attention towards them.

My biggest complaint is the gameplay for keyboard and mouse:
It feels that Mass Effect 2 and 3 puts the player at a major disadvantage when the game recognizes that they're not using a controller. The mini-games to hack terminals are noticeably more punishing unless the player uses a controller, and the combat clearly wasn't designed for mouse and keyboard.

It's strange for me to say this, but I believe that using a controller (PS4 controller in my case) makes the game feel comfortable and more enjoyable. It's truly such a shame that so much effort for the Legendary Edition wasn't adequate for the mouse and keyboard experience (unless you're playing ME1, then it's towards the player's favor).

In conclusion, the game simply didn't age well, but I'm still a sucker for Garrus Vakarian.

***Recent Review***
I think Mass Effect's biggest issue as a whole is its indecisive identity between a first-person shooter and an RPG (the kind where looking at numbers matter). Mass Effect does a terrible job reminding you that numbers matter. Because, the developers chose to hide those numbers from the player in the first place.

I have the impression that decisions about how characters in one's party greatly impact combat and conversations // relationships. However, it simply doesn't!
At the end of the day, the RPG elements of what a character can do for the player, and their involvement in the story is merely for flavor. No depth or actual impact of affecting combat and conversations. 

Garrus, for example, is a good boy who tried his best to do what's right, but got fed up with obligations, rules and authority. So, he went just a teensie little renegade to accomplish what's legitimately right; I like it! I love it! I want MORE of it!
However, he's terrible at fending off enemies with barriers and armor (which are the norm towards mid-game), and there's nothing I can do to change that.

Ultimately, the game feels like I was playing two different kinds of games that weren't fully meshed together. Between a TV show where the storytelling was prioritized, and a first-person shooter that didn't present the RPG elements to the player with impact.",1692427893,1704001631,False,1,0,0.474999994039535522,0,True,False,False

[b] The Aspect Of The Trilogy [/b]
[i] You play as Commander Shepard part of the Navy Alliance who must save the galaxy from an unknown yet repeat threat throughout the trilogy. [/i]

[b] My Two Cent Review [/b]
[i] It is a rare occasion I will actually finish a game from start to finish without getting bored half way and abandoning the game to be left in my vast library of finished games I have barely touched this game is something else... I have always heard good things about the mass effect games and as well as bad things but sci-fi games had always gotten my interest. I decided to give it a shot so I bought the Trilogy and played all three games on insanity and this game I can 100% say with a certainty gave me a run for my money. To those who love story and a good challenge I recommend the torture I endured with 128 hours I spent playing these games. I love combat just as much as I love a good story I felt a great mix between the two honestly. The combat was engaging and ever expanding with new challenges always around the corner and on my level of difficulty I truly felt like I was fighting against all odds and it felt so much sweeter winning battles, I truly fight I was fighting for my life in that game with plenty of do or die moments in that game and I have died... I died and died and died and almost raged quit 3 times but I stuck true and finished what I started. The story itself is intriguing where you are commander facing a reoccurring threat with a rag tag team of squamates you'll get attached to and a ship you'll enjoy commanding. You can either a caring, supportive commander that will do everything in his/her power to help anyone they can along the way. Or you can be a cold, ruthless commander that will get the job done no matter the cost. or you can be in-between but where's the fun in that now? Each game had there up's and down's but at the end of the day it was fun experience all in all and it certainly has it's charms. I highly recommend this game highly and I encourage all to not take my word for it but to try it for yourself and see what I mean. [/i]

[b] Before you read my opinions, know the game play is very stiff but serviceable. Kinda like tank controls. [/b]

As a recently new Mass Effect fan, I can confidently say, this series is my new favorite sci-fi video game collection. It's unbelievable how much I was glued to my seat. Every piece of story & lore, I needed to find out what was next & how it all came together. Some of the themes you'll experience in the trilogy are so well executed, you won't even realize it has been done in other types of mediums. Until the ""ah ha"" moment kicks in. Most importantly though, play it for the journey & you'll be satisfied.

[h2] A brief pros & cons of each game: [/h2]

[b] Mass Effect 1 | our galaxy so close but so far [/b] 
+ Best world building & story
+ Grounded universe with an explainable codex
- Suicidal AI
- Hacking minigame & planet exploration is OUTDATED
- Inventory management sucks

[b] Mass Effect 2 | the bully, the wobbly chair, the drinks [/b]
+ Best character development & side missions
+ Ability to interrupt character actions/speeches (also in 3)
- Story length is laughable
- The scanning minigame is tedious

[b] Mass Effect 3 | nights in between the stars [/b]
+ Best combat & DLCs
+ Streamlined the minor annoyances of the first 2 games
- Questionable writing at certain dialogue checks, cutscenes, & major plot holes
- Where is the damn multiplayer mode at?? (co-op horde mode) 
* The standalone version of ME3 on Steam includes multiplayer 

[b] *** [/b] And it wouldn't be Mass Effect without talking about the ending of 3. Unless you lived under a rock during those hours. All I can say is, it wasn't very good, definitely not the worst I've seen in a sci-fi game. My stance is quite neutral to be honest.

How is ME1 so good and ME2 so fkn sh1t? For over 10 years I had the opposite opinion, until I finally got around to replaying them. Mass Effect 1 must've been a fluke. There's no other explanation.
If ME1 is a 9/10 with a couple of plot holes, then ME2 is a 2/10. Only the visuals improved, it loses drastically by every other metric. It doesn't even feel like I'm playing Mass Effect, it feels like some shoddy rip off of Gears of War. I don't know any other game where you run on rails forward and it snaps you into cover. Doesn't even matter if you're trying to run to the other side of the barricade. It's embarrassingly bad.
This game has completely tanked my opinion of bioware. Mass Effect 2 is to the ME series, what Dark Souls 2 is to the DS series. 
Here are a few of the notes that I made while playing this game:
In the 2 years while Shepard was dead they forgot how to make weapons that don't require you to pick up ammunition. They also forgot what grenades are.
Everything is dumbed down significantly, feels like a console game. You level up way less often and to be hoenst it doesn't matter if you do. 2/3 of the skills you used to have are gone, all you have left is some sad little bare bones of a skill tree. Leveling up used to be fun.
You no longer get exp for killing every enemy, so the game doesn't mind spawning infinite enemies if it feels like it, like in the Garrus loyalty mission (and that's beside the fact that a lowly smuggler on the run from C Sec has a giant warehouse full of armed guards and infinite mechs). 
The AI was already really bad in the first game, but here it feels even worse. Your companions may as well not exist, because they'll stand in front of cover, get 3 shot and die. The entire reviving companions system is worse as well. At least before you could use it as many times as you wanted as well as heal them with a separate limited amount of medigel. 
You can never quicksave unless the game randomly feels like it, even if there are no enemies nearby, even if you're not in combat. Considering how long the battles are with many waves of enemies, getting 3 shot and restarting from the beginning is awful.
All combat is now wave based horde modes instead of the much better limited but well placed enemies in the first game. The game also tries to cheese you on every occasion, putting heavy guards with rockets everywhere it can.
Do any of the enemies suffer from limited ammunition? Of course not. But you do. Guess what I love the most in a mass effect game? Running around collecting a generic tube of ammo (same for all gun types, why did you even bother?) back and forth.
There is no longer any customisation of your weapons and armor, no mods. In the first game you could swap them out at any time depending on the situation. Now they just don't exist and they don't show you any stats of any weapons you have. 
Gun damage is awful, gun balance is awful, can no longer use all weapons like before unless you unlock 1 or 2 in a story mission.
Even the writing got worse. There's occasionally a spark of brilliance, but the way entire missions are written is just sh1t. The ""Save Dr Kelso"" mission is a prime example, where you wake up inside a locked medical room, where the button to release you on the other side, but look at this, there's randomly a convenient console right where you woke up which lets you, check this sh1t out, control and UNLIMITED amount of combat drones that spawn in the room that has the release button. You can't make this sh1t up. Either a r3tard wrote this or the devs think the players are r3tards. 
I have 2 more pages, but this is enough. What an awful game.
I no longer care what happens in the 3rd one. Thank fk i didnt pay more than 20 euros for this.",1703795686,1703795686,False,3,0,0.408336043357849121,0,True,False,False

Sure, they're all around decent games with an amazing story and just as much wrong with it as there is right with it. The only way to really ""get"" it, I think, is to play through the trilogy. But if everyone got into media based on a ""just trust me"" approach, then we wouldn't find anything good. So let me tell you about my history with Mass Effect and what it means to me.

I first got into these games in 2017. I got a copy of the first game on from trading Team Fortress 2 items, for the equivalent of about five bucks. I fell in love with the universe it presented to me right away; I had never experienced a game story like this before, one that drew me in and gripped me with the characters, the details about the setting, the presentation and the music. Six years later, I see the flaws in it much more clearly, something not helped by Legendary Edition breaking some things or disrupting the presentation in its attempts to ""modernize"" these games. 3 is impacted the least in this regard, and the absence of the multiplayer in this release is also unfortunate, though not terribly significant in the long run due to it making the mechanics of that game slightly easier to control. But there is really nothing else like this out there, nothing that I've found. With this kind of science fiction aesthetic, detail in the world construction, wonderful characters and a grander narrative that will be a part of me for the rest of my life, even with the ending being what it is.

If you have the chance to not know anything about these games, and are ready to go in fresh, if you want to uncover a deep and thought out universe to fulfill you, then these games are a must. They aren't perfect, far from it. There's lots of problems with how they handle certain topics and the writing only gets more shoddy the further along you go, but none of that stops Mass Effect being greater than the sum of its parts. You will find characters you love, stories that you'll want to see through, and these games may help you think about the world, stories, and yourself in ways you never have before; they did for me. In that way, these imperfections are what make Mass Effect so wondrous. It's so very human in its construction, flaws and all, a time capsule of trends in gaming around its release and an escape to a time where things in the industry were less homogeneous, or at least an escape to a pretty damn good illusion of that. They have their rough edges; the games sometimes break in front of you,  the developer isn't what it used to be, the third party launcher stuff is annoying, and if you're like me, the ending will really hurt the first time, to the point that I don't feel the need to hide that behind a spoiler tag. You know it has a mixed ending, by now. But that changes nothing. These are my favorite games and story within games, and one of my favorite stories of all time. I do think you, whoever you are, would like it as well.",1703646072,1703646072,True,2,0,0.532685399055480957,0,True,False,False

Well, it still have all that, but the main story is filler, your companions barely talk to each other, many loyalty missions are over before you know it, and most importantly companions run out of things to say way too soon. Calibration is a meme for a reason, poor Garrus might as well be dead in the entire second half of the game. The good stuff is still really freaking cool. 8/10

-ME3 was the surprise of the year for me. I was ignoring it for a decade because of the ending stink, and it is exactly the game I remember ME2 being. Something epic and сhill-inducing is happening every hour, series-long conflicts have a satisfying resolutions, companions NEVER run out of something to say and have proper relationships between each other, what kind of sorcery is this? It was very fortunate that I waited a decade tho, because Bioware and most importantly the fans fixed the ending for me.

The sub quests are hard to complete because of the lack of navigational aids i spent an hour trying to find my progression point even after tagging it.  Vehicle combat is confusing and complex to control.  They tried to emulate the Warthog from Halo but failed badly.  The Landscape of planets is barren and uninteresting.

This remaster is a mixed bag, and if you like Mass Effect, you'll like this. But the series as a whole? I kept getting burned out halfway through the second game, and I could never figure out why, but I think I finally figured it out.

Before we even get to the graphics, first impressions. You got this on Steam, but EA's traffic is down, so get ready to play with two launchers running at the same time, and if you try and open it through the EA app, it just opens Steam right back. Annoying.
Graphics: A slight improvement over the version I saw on Xbox 360, but considering you can just get the original game for 5 dollars and get the MEUITM texture mod on Nexus for free, and it actually looks better than the version EA is charging for, that counts for nothing. It is nice to be able to play with a controller without modding controller support in too, though. Unfortunately, that is my favorite thing about this game. The first game is much improved with QoL changes like UI tweaks, a streamlined inventory system, and a slighty more agile Mako. All is well.

What's not to like in ME2?

First of all, they removed the loot and inventory management, and dialed up the difficulty a notch, and at first I thought this was a positive thing, because at Level 60, with all level 10 (or X) weapons and armor, the first game gets a little tedious in the late game, after multiple playthroughs. If you're getting multiple playthroughs out of me, something is working. So what did they replace it with? Well, it turns out, together, these two main changes are a disastrous combination. The skill tree and the degree to which you can improve your equipment are vastly simplified, leading encounters to feel stale and predictable. Now, on the standard difficulty setting, they've managed to hit this disgusting middle ground where here the combat is insultingly easy, but when you dial it up to Hardcore, it becomes literally impossible, so either way, right away I'm not having fun. I gave up on a mission where you have to destroy a bunch of giant mechs before they can destroy 20 crates. Why yes, that does sound like the worst level of all time, and it turns out it is, because on Hardcore, no matter who you pick or what you tell them to do, both of your squadmates quickly die, and then you empty literally every bullet you have into the nearest mech, including the heavy weapon, and you manage to take out most of his shields before he dices you into powder with two out of ten million minigun bullets flying at you.

Wait a minute, I hear you wonder. Bullets? Ammo? Why, didn't they carefully establish in the codex already that a little laser shaves off a little particle from a block of metal in your future space pistol, and you have theoretically infinite ammo, and all of your guns cool off in seconds because it's the year 2130 whatever? No, it turns out that years after the first game, technology has actually improved so much that we found it far more efficient to remove all ability for our guns to vent even 0.01% of heat by themselves, defying the laws of physics, and instead rely on magical thermal clips that instantly restore your weapons and work exactly the same way as bullets from a thousand years ago so we can retcon this to be more like Gears of War without any of the interesting weapon, enemy, or level design. Hey, if you just want to play through the story on easy mode and be totally unchallenged by the gameplay, that's your prerogative, but I'm falling asleep here.

Perhaps picking Infiltrator was a mistake, because not only is there no reward in any of the level design for sneaking around anywhere that I've seen, during a fight or otherwise, the cloak also feels like it was balanced for a multiplayer the game does not have, because it never seems to work half the time, and wears off in seconds. Oh, and maybe if you told me up front that the AI hacking doesn't even work until you've removed two thirds of their health bar, I would have picked something else, because maybe that would have helped me out in that terrible mission, but no.
You find different weapons and token upgrades, but they all feel the same, so you don't feel like you're making any progress.

They did what devs always do when they can't design a shooter, just gave the enemies another billion HP per difficulty level and changed nothing else. The fact that ammo didn't even need to be a thing, and is now part of the problem, makes it doubly hilarious. They took out inventory management, but then they replaced it with busywork when now you have to remember to open the stupid menu and put the stupid fire on your stupid gun at the beginning of every stupid firefight, but on Hardcore it made no tangible difference anyway. When you pour points into disruptor ammo and get it to level 3 of 4, put it on a gun designed to work against mechs with shields, and then it doesn't work on mechs with shields, that's an uninstall, bro. I honestly can't believe I avoided spoilers to ME3 for over a decade for this.

If you like single-player narrative gaming, this is for you.

If you like science fiction, this is for you.

If you get invested in roleplaying characters in games, this is for you.

If you only want light gaming or fast paced multiplayer to the exclusion of other content, then it is not for you.  And that's ok, but most of the folks reading this will be at least partial to what this game offers, and on sale it really is worth investing the pennies per hour to give it a shot.

I have another 300-ish hours logged for the Xbox version and likely more than that for the original 360 games.  So, I have put 1000+ hours into the original games and remaster combined.  A quick game-by-game rundown:

-Mass Effect 1 is a masterclass in world building and my favorite of the 3.  There is no game I've played that gives me the same sense of wonder and amazement, like I am truly living in a hypothetical sci-fi future.  The world building and atmosphere are so good that they more than make up for any other flaw in the game for me.  The combat is more fluid with the Legendary Edition, but still has some jank to it.  It is a blend of 3rd person cover shooter with crpg DNA under the hood.  Honestly I really like the combat in ME1, but I understand why others do not.

-Mass Effect 2 is my least favorite, but many others have it at the top of their list.  It's kind of like saying cheese pizza is my least favorite pizza.  At the end of the day I'm still happily eating pizza.  The combat is streamlined and fluid, but at the cost of much of the rpg elements.  The atmosphere and cinematics in ME2 are much more polished compared to ME1 and the squadmates are given a lot of attention and characterization.  ME2 directly references your savegame from ME1, and the world state changes somewhat based on your ME1 choices.  The characters are the biggest highlight in this one.

-Mass Effect 3 is flawed, but amazing for what it is.  ME3 references your save data from both previous games and your choices in those games really affect how you experience this one.  The pacing can be rough at times and the story-telling can feel rushed and unpolished, but ultimately ME3 successfully completes the trilogy of games and does so in a way that really gives you a sense of agency throughout the journey.  Even though ME3 has some controversial elements, it also has some of the best moments in the trilogy.  The combat in ME3 is also a highlight.  It preserves the polished feel from ME2 and adds back some of the rpg feel from ME1.

All 3 games are pretty great on their own, but the collection of all 3 is greater than the sum of its parts.  ME Legendary Edition is worth its full price and even more worth it when you can find it on sale.

So Excited now to play the other 2 games.

Mass Effect 2 - The opening to this game was amazing. And the final suicide mission was shocking and great. You get more choices and consequences and make the story your own. Your decisions count. Sometimes the unintended consequences of your actions sting, but that's what makes the game so unique and great. I loved my time with this game and it's a must-play.

Mass Effect 3 - Man what a journey it has been. From hunting down Saren in the first game to the epic finale of Mass Effect 3 it's been a ride. I like the ending though I understand why some people might have had problems with it. The game is enjoyable from start to finish. The opening sequence set the tone for the game.

The first game does a fantastic job of setting up a new setting, the aliens are believable unlike Star Trek or Star Wars. Combat is a bit rough but once you get used to it you will feel comfortable. Biotics are king in the first game as you ignore shields with your push and such. I think Sentinel is the best class in all the games overall. I have played as every class in every game except 3.

The second game is still glorious. It had been ten years and still I get the chills and the awe. Mass Effect 2's level of epicness matches legendary games such  Dragon Age Origins, Witcher 3, and Baldur's Gate 2 & 3, It lacks some depth in areas but makes up for it with the rich characters and story. Its almost a perfect evolution of the first game in terms of gameplay, except one change. In the first game each ability had a separate cooldown. They changed that to make it so all abilities share a cooldown. This was a bad decision .The original system encouraged smart use of all powers you had. This system encourages spamming the best one for the situation always.

Third game was marred by the ending. We all know Indoctrination theory was correct and they were too proud to admit their idea was trash and the fan one was brilliant.

My main complaint in the series is some of the bungled story moments. They make certain things seem like a big deal in the first and second game that do not have much impact. I do like the romances restricted by your gender but as a gay Femshep my options are Liara in 1. Samara in 2 who will not romance a renegade, which I am  playing. So its Liara again. Then in 3 its basically going to have to be Liara again. I already romanced her and stayed faithful on my original playthrough. I want to experience other dialogue.

The way that all three games melded almost seamlessly together to form a grandiose space opera makes the Legendary edition one of the best gaming experiences I had in recent times. 

The companion characters are all so memorable and fleshed out with each having a unique motivation and backstory, which you can gradually explore through multiple conversations and their side missions. Each alien species you encounter has their own history, culture and opinion of Humanity that you can slowly get a sense of as you travel around and complete the optional quests. 

Finally, some of the decisions that you make will directly affect whether a companion will survive into the future games and even the survival of entire alien species will depend on your whims and wishes. 

Still, that is not to say that these games do not have areas that performed poorly. The combat mechanics are quite lackluster, particularly for ME1, though by the time I play ME3 it has definitely improved considerably. Lots of the side quests also unfortunately fall into the common cliche of being generic fetch quests for the sake of padding game time. 

Overall, this game took me around 100 hours to complete all three games, all the DLCs and most of the side quests. Some of the choices I had to make and the dialogue between characters seriously tucked at my heartstrings. Spending so much time interacting with my companions have made me grown attached to them and it really was tough getting all the way to the end.

I enjoy competing & I enjoy talking shit & telling my ops on how shit that they are. I've enjoyed doing that since Halo 3, back when I was 10 on the 360. The thrill I got from telling grown men who were my dad's age that I t-bagged them gave me straight dopamine. As luck would have it. Another game was released in 2007 that would change my life as well. Sadly, I wouldn't experience the dopamine that the Mass Effect series would give me until 16 years later, but that is quite poetic. I was gifted the original Mass Effect for Christmas & played it once & was completely lost after the 1st mission. Driving around on random planets without a single clue of WTF am I supposed to do now? Sadly, YouTube wasn't really a thing back then & my parents didn't get me that Mass Effect Game Informer edition, so I never played it again. Now, as a 26-year-old man, I can confidently say that the Mass Effect trilogy is the best trilogy of games of ALL TIME!

ME1 does start a bit slow, but once you realize that all of your past decisions are now compiling onto each other and are directly shaping your story, it completely immerses you within this new world that you feel you are shaping. This year I've played Cyberpunk, Starfield, all 3 of Insomniac's Spider-Man games, fallout 76 & both Jedi fallen order games & this trilogy of games was so DAMN GOOD that I proceeded to play my 1st play-through knowing that I wasn't unlocking any trophies & I continued to play because it was THAT GOOD. I completed my 2nd playthrough about a month ago & unlocked most trophies & I'll likely play another to complete all of them because I've seriously enjoyed all 196 hours that I've played on this title. Shit...the only reason why I decided to play this game was because I paid for a yearly subscription to EA Play & got this game for free & after my 1st playthrough, I decided to buy the game cause I wanted to give back to BioWare for creating such a fantastic piece of work.

Finally finished ME3. Wow. IDK how people were mad at the ending cutscenes and not just the absolutely awful writing of the end solutions. The Leviathan DLC and trying to explain the reapers absolutely ruined everything this trilogy has been building and made it clear they had no idea where they were going when they started this game.

It's a phenomenal journey, allowing you to progress with the same beloved character from ME1 through ME3, crafting a personal and epic narrative.

The mechanics in ME2 and ME3 are particularly impressive, with ME3's shooting mechanics standing out. The gameplay is fluid, engaging, and evolves meaningfully across the series. Every decision, every battle feels impactful.

The story is the heart of the Mass Effect series. It's a rich, complex narrative woven through a breathtaking galaxy. The companions - Tali, Legion, Garrus, Wrex, Grunt, and others - are not just characters; they're friends with deep stories, making the adventure even more memorable.

Visually, the game is a feast for the eyes. The remastered graphics bring the universe to life in a way that's both awe-inspiring and authentic to the original experience.

If I had one wish, it would be for more exploration of the Protheans, an intriguing aspect of the lore that begs for deeper exploration.

In summary, ""Mass Effect Legendary Edition"" is a must-play for any gamer. It's a beautifully crafted love letter to the original series, maintaining all the elements that made us fall in love with the Mass Effect universe, while enhancing it in all the right ways.",1628796368,1702750900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This initial encounter served as a stark reminder of the game's roots in an earlier gaming era, slightly tempering my initial enthusiasm. 

However, as I delved deeper into the vast expanses of the 'Mass Effect' universe, my initial reservations were quickly overshadowed by the game's immersive qualities. The controls, which had initially seemed jarring, soon became intuitive, seamlessly integrating into the overall experience. This ease of adaptability is a testament to the game’s meticulously crafted design, which remains captivating and engaging, rivaling many contemporary titles despite its vintage.

The crowning achievement of the 'Mass Effect Legendary Edition' lies in its narrative. The storyline is a paradigm of video game storytelling, intricately weaving complex plots across a galaxy brimming with diverse species, cultures, and intricate histories. The depth and richness of the lore are truly breathtaking, inviting players to immerse themselves deeply in its intricacies. The character development is exceptional, with each companion bringing a distinct story, personality, and viewpoint, enriching the galactic journey with personal and impactful nuances.

The game's mission design deserves special mention for its astonishing diversity and non-repetitive nature. Each mission in the 'Mass Effect' universe is not just a task or an objective; it's an adventure in itself, filled with unique challenges and story elements that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. The designers have done an extraordinary job of ensuring that each mission contributes meaningfully to the overarching narrative, while also standing out as a distinct and memorable experience. This diversity in mission design is one of the many aspects that makes the 'Mass Effect Legendary Edition' a masterpiece in the realm of interactive storytelling.

In addition, the comprehensive volume of content in the Legendary Edition is remarkable. Encompassing three full games and all their DLCs, this compilation offers an expansive and enriching experience that can captivate players for countless hours.

It naturally contains all the DLC content, which at this point is an integral part of the story to be honest. 

Unfortunately the multiplayer mode was cut from the Legendary Edition. While it's not necessary for the story and the game works well without, it was still a lot of fun and would probably still be to this day.

I enjoyed the original ME games and played all and beat all. Yes the original ending of ME3 had some issues but they made some changed a decade ago to placate the angry mobs. The LE version is a step up, probably not worth full price to original owners but I bought on sale and the games are worth it in that case. For first time owners, the ME series is worth your time if you like shooter RPG style games like borderlands(kind of anyway-little less Diablo style loot though).
My problem with this product lies solely with the interaction between EA launcher and Steam. I am not sure who is to blame, my long time bias says EA as does the fact that other games with company launchers seem to play ok, but I really don't know in this case. 
YMMV, but the biggest problem lies with achievements, so if you do not care about achievements this may not matter. Anyway to get achievements to work, you have to place the launcher in off-line mode to play the game. Not really a big deal, but it gets worse. After playing for hours the launcher will basically time out and then I have to restart launcher and game. Beyond that, every few times the launcher times out, it is no longer possible to restart the game. Methods like restarting system, clearing cache normally work but it takes further actions after a while like deleting the game and launcher. From what I have seen online, EA knows and seems to have no cares about resolving issues with their launcher, so buyer beware. From what I have read, this does not matter if the product is bought directly through EA, but I do not know that for sure.",1702410194,1702410194,False,1,0,0.501754403114318848,0,True,False,False

The game's compelling characters, extended continuity, masterful world building and gut-wrenching arcs make for a space opera that rivals the likes of Star Wars.  There's hours upon hours of video essay material that do a much better job than I at elaborating on why this trilogy is one of the best examples in gaming history of world building and character writing.  The modding scene for this game is more than alive and well: incredibly detailed overhaul mods, among others, continue to breathe new life into these games already brimming with expert world building.

Now that the mountain of praise is out of the way, the harsh reality is that this is an EA game.  You need EA's shady DRM to even run it, the same DRM that is essentially the exact same program as Origin was except this time, you have to sign new terms in which you agree to allow EA and its affiliates to sell all of your data including but not limited to your address and even your payment information.  You can't turn this feature off as now none of your games that run through EA app will run without an active internet connection.  The first two games in this trilogy do not even have an online component.  You will pay for this product and then only have access to it when EA says so.   Unless that sounds like a fair deal to you, I'd go ahead and just download it elsewhere (legally) (haha... unless)

There's also the matter of the obvious plot holes written into the final game of the trilogy.  I understand that the main voice of the series' writing left the company some time during the development of ME2, and the more you examine major plot points after ME2, the worse things get for this story.  [spoiler] The entirety of Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2's Arrival DLC are completely pointless once you start ME3, and it's glaring.  The Reapers show that this entire time they had the ability to use conventional travel to reach the heart of Citadel space within just 2 years, and that a surprise attack was never necessary for them to gain a strong upper hand in the war immediately.  There was never any point to Sovereign, the conduit, or blowing the relay in ME2.  They were always able to show up whenever they wanted, apparently.  This breaks canon and also makes Shepard's sacrifice of over 300k people completely in vain. The Catalyst at the end of ME3 is also just a giant black hole in the plot.  It argues in circles and really has no sound reasoning for why the games played out the way that they did. [/spoiler] I could go on for another hour about these 2 glaring plot holes but it's far easier to just tell you not to think about them and enjoy what is otherwise an absolute gem of a sci-fi story.  

The truth is that ignorance is bliss, and this game provides an excellent illusion.  The world building and characters will pull you in and fully immerse you in a truly grand sci-fi experience.

I always prefer open-word games more than non-open-word games. As non-open-word games usually provide a restricted choice of routes, which implies the player having little to no impact on the storyline's direction. The lack of real choice in many of those games kinda put me off in a way that I know the world of the game is not going to change anyway. My gameplay, my investment in the world, and my choices in that game are often meaningless. The word just demonstrates no respect for my decisions, and it resembles an artificially tailored game rather than a virtual other-world.   

I am glad that I am wrong. Linear games are often JRPGs and JRPGs-like games in my earlier experience, and I was misled to think that all linear games are like JRPGs, in which players follow a pre-determined path and the game does not acknowledge the decisions of the players. This creates an impression for me that all linear games are as restrictive as that. Unexpectedly, there are linear games, that respect players' decisions, and allow some degree of freedom for the player to decide the route they would like to take, the friends they would like to make, and most importantly, the fate of the world. Mass Effect trilogy is one of those examples.   

I bought this game when it was on sale, hoping to get some space RPGs before the release of Starfield. Just expecting an Okay-ish game. It is not, and it is in fact, a masterpiece.  

The companions are all unique in their own ways. Their questlines are deep enough. The world is linear yet not confined. The player enjoys the autonomy to explore and do whatever they wish to do.  

There are some flaws. The combat of the first game feels kind of outdated. And the ending of the trilogy feels unrealistic and childish. It gave me the impression that this is not the intended ending originally planned by the developers, but they ran out of ideas to end the storyline properly, so they just threw this to the player.  

But all things considered, I would still very much regard this game as a masterpiece. The freedom of choice is just so prevalent in this game, and it is so hard not to like it.  

By the way, the achievement of this game is broken (garbage EA launcher). It is something that you might need to bear in mind if your gaming motivation is achievement-oriented. The are ways to work around it (kinda) but you need to do some work. Keep it in mind that the achievement system of this game is just not going to work without a little bit of tinkering.",1702115573,1702115573,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, some day is today. With the Legendary Edition, all 3 games with all DLC are united in one affordable package. Polished up and ready to play, I am approximately 15 hours into the first game, basking in the nostalgia but also amazed at how well this game holds up.

[i] (TLDR at the bottom) [/i]


Now, when i say ""genre-defining"" that doesn't always mean in a good way. (we will get to that at the end)

[h3] Science Fiction, as Told by Modern Man [/h3]

  First off, I had never played Mass Effect 1 until I bought this game and played it all the way through (twice). What an amazing sci-fi experience. I had just watched through Star Trek: The Next Generation for the first time, and coincidentally diving into this game after felt so right. Mass Effect was clearly inspired by the worlds of Star Wars and Star Trek, bringing a modern action game feel and media dialect to those older stories and making them feel new in Mass Effect 1.

   When I think of the strengths of Mass Effect 1, I think of 3 things: Writing, Writing, and Writing. This doesn't mean other aspects aren't great, it just means the writing is so above and beyond all other ingredients of this game. Bioware was fresh from their work on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2 (PLEASE CHECK THOSE OUT), and their amazing writing from these games follow through into their own original universe. The foundation laid in this game carries on into the entire trilogy. Things like each alien species' identities, your party members individually, and the factions at play in this world. 

   The dialogue is amazing in and of itself, and you as the player can make choices that change it dramatically. This feat is overlooked as 3 games have come and gone, doing this system justice. Writing one game's dialogue is hard enough, imagine writing 2 games worth of dialogue, packing it into one, and making it work interchangeably to account for all player choice, due to the morality system in these games. Bioware set the standard for single player RPG's in their time. 

[h3] Perfectly Balanced...[/h3]

   Mass Effect 2 chose to embrace the action side of the Action-RPG, and aimed to be a perfect hybrid between gameplay and story. This game's story is honestly within a bubble when it comes to the main conflict of the Mass Effect trilogy, it could be described as plot filler with tons of character development, but in hindsight, this is to the game's benefit. Mass Effect 2 is my favorite game of the series, and one of my favorite games of all time. 

   Darker (before it was cool), Rebellious, and full of misfit characters, this game differentiated itself greatly from Mass Effect 1. Almost an antithesis to the squeaky-clean Citadel of Mass Effect 1, this game had you exploring the criminal underbelly of the universe, shacking up with gang leaders and human supremacists. I love the diverse group of aliens you can meet in this game, and I also love seeing how returning characters have changed since the first game. 

   Mass Effect 2's greatest strength is the absolute devotion shown to its main cast of characters, their writing, and how you interact with them. An entire set of unique loyalty missions define their arc's conclusion and allow you as the player to take part in their moral choices. I love characters above all else, and this is why I find Mass Effect 2 to be so amazing. The structure of the game is built on recruiting allies, and then using your bond with them to lead them through hell and back. The final mission of this game is one of the greatest moments in all of gaming, perfectly executed and challenges you as the player with REAL stakes that get your blood pumping. If you have interest in playing Mass Effect 2, the less you know the better. 

[h3] Time Heals All Wounds [/h3]

   Mass Effect 3 is the black sheep of the trilogy. Its ending was a gigantic controversy felt anywhere video games were discussed in 2012. One of the reasons I consider Mass Effect 3 to be ""genre-defining"" is because the game's reception was a warning sign to everyone else in the future to take extreme care in how you end your series. There are however, other lessons to be learned from Mass Effect 3 that are often overlooked.

   Right now, if you could think of the number 1 reason a game comes out feeling unfinished or rushed, what is it? Crunch Time. Employee Crunch. Mass Effect 3 was hugely anticipated, and so Bioware, under EA's care (ha) was extremely rushed and forced to release the game early, without wrapping up all loose ends. Remember when I said Mass Effect 1's greatest strength was writing, and Mass effect 2 is a balance between action and writing? Well.... Mass Effect 3 starts to swing the other way and become a very fun action game with satisfactory writing. Lots of things either don't make a lot of sense, or seem too convenient. These minor errors are completely overlooked because of the game's ending, but play a large part in why this game feels... off.

   Mass Effect 3 ramps up the main plot of the trilogy, and it feels like everything is coming to an end. You are forced to make world defining choices, picking your allies, and betraying others. How far are you willing to go to save the universe? This on paper, handled by the Bioware we know and love up until this point, could turn out amazing. The sad part is that Bioware was not given proper time to work their magic, so these world ending stakes fall flat in most areas. Choices feel like ""The normal person choice"" or ""The mustache-twirling villain choice."" The morality system has finally been turned on its head and become a joke. Renegade (or the ""bad-cop"") choices are extremely villainous and no longer ""ends justify the means, to a reasonable extent."" This decay of logic creeps in a lot during Mass Effect 3, to the point where it seems meaningless to make certain choices. 

   All of the negativity aside, Mass Effect 3 is very fun to mess around in. With the most modern controls, the action gameplay feels fluid and actually challenging on the highest difficulties. Furthermore, the story, especially with the characters themselves, has amazing moments that can give closure to you as a player. Lastly, DLC included with this Legendary Edition really does a great job patching up some of the story issues, Bioware wanted to make up for their misstep in the ending, and created one of the finest pieces of ""fan-service"" (I'm not saying this sarcastically swear) as a gift to the fans to enjoy. The Citadel DLC is a big reason this game healed over time, a must play for someone who made it this far. 

[i] These games came into and shaped my life in a way I can never fully comprehend, they are fantastic and even at their worst offer something you will fondly remember. [/i]


[h3] TLDR [/h3]

Mass Effect 1: Cozy, beautifully written world with a ton of lasting charm. 9.4/10

Mass Effect 2: Gritty, amazing character writing with an insane conclusion that never leaves you. 9.8/10

Mass Effect 3: Fun Combat, (comparatively) so-so writing with an unfinished story that earns its Black Sheep status. 8.2/10

[b] Mass Effect 1 [/b]

- Multiple crashes and plenty of visual bugs and glitches
- Mako can get stuck in mid-air; can partially clip into terrain due to improper collision. 
- Shepard is forced to walk facing backwards at times. I've seen walking simulators with fewer glitches and this is a remaster of an old game.
- Squadmates get stuck on Feros, thus leaving you on your own if combat is located further away.
- Cryo weapon mod sound effect out of sync with the visuals.
- Combat sometimes overlaps character dialogue, essentially requiring a reload. Press F9 to pay respect.
- Mid conversation crashes are particularly hurtful. In my case the game even crashed during the 1st council dialogue. Not a good look. 


[b] Mass Effect 2 [/b]

- Due to the frequent nature of crashes, the autosave feature here was a true breath of fresh air. ME1 needed it too!
- Conversation with Aria= crash. 1st conversation with Mordin= crashed 4 times.
- Can't skip the intro and initial cutscene. Imagine wanting your own custom Shepard and not being able to make fine changes without re-watching everything. I imagine speedrunners face a similar issue. 
- Crash in the galaxy map
- Crash mid-fight


[b] Mass Effect 3 [/b]

- I don't concern myself with whether or not Huerta is a vegetable or a cyborg. However, I do care if gossip about him is going to lead to a blue screen of death while on my way to completing an objective.
- Enemies falling through debris, becoming unreachable and effectively stopping the flow of the mission. 
- Fumbling in the dark with a flashlight isn't my thing. I'm counting this as a bug. Deal with it. 
- After helping Conrad find his soulmate, if you activate the medical dispenser you'll be incorrectly pointed back to the refugee doctor's location, despite already having completed this objective. 
- Head movement in some scenes must've been inspired by owls. Near 360 degree rotation. Go figure.
- Specialist Traynor is a bit late with the notifications sometimes.
- Crosshair randomly showing up and gradually vanishing upon loading a new game on the Normandy V2
- Why are there med kits on a Geth Dreadnought? Explain. [No obvious answers pls]
- Enemies get stuck in between objects or out of bounds, which is especially problematic in the Armax Arsenal Arena. No fix but to reload the match. 
- The ""helmet off in dialogue"" is rather hit & miss depending upon RNG at times. I just go without by default. No headshots, please.

To me, it is the spiritual successor to my beloved Kotor games (Which I played in my youth and thought to be the pinnacle of rpgs). It has a lot of similarities to kotor in terms of roleplaying mechanics and the depth of the world- and character building, just instead of star wars it is set in its own wonderful and intriguing universe. It was released right at the edge of the era when all big AAA games (especially from EA) became soulless shitfests made only for profit. With this trilogy, you can still feel that delivering the best possible games was still the first priority.

To give you a quick summary of my Rating beforehand: The trilogy, all in all, would be 9/10 possible points. Its a wild ride from start to finish that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Each game has its own strengths and weaknesses, but all of them are overall an enjoyable experience bot gameplay- and storywise.

To rate every single game is hard. ME1 is good, but there are some questionable decisions regarding the gameplay and though the story is nice, I dont feel it is as enticing as what would follow in the later games. It serves very well as an entry into the series and solid basis on which to improve on though and introduces a lot of the decisions the results of which you will feel in later games.

ME2 is definitely my favourite of the 3. From start to finish, the story keep you invested. You are being kept in a loop about the true intentions of cerberus and thus cant really trust your employer - all the while fighting to protect the galaxy from a much bigger threat. There are some very deep decisions to be made here and what you did in ME1 will come back to you a lot in ME2. The characters are well written and played with lots of background to make you emotionally invested. The gameplay has been improved from the first entry of the series as well, making this an extremely good RPG overall. 

ME3 is a good game aswell. I feel like the gameplay is the smoothest out of all 3, making moving around and fighting more engaging and fun. Throughout the game, it manages really well to both play with the players emotions regarding certain topics, push them to make impactful and morally ambiguous decisions as well as display the horrors of an intergalactic war. One thing I really liked was the sense of urgency ME3 managed to create in me: It really felt like I had to hurry up and complete my mission lest the reapers or cerberus win. Many of the previous games characters return and are fleshed out more, which leads to you be even more emotionally invested into them. The Interactions you can have with them are also very nice. I didnt like that you were rather restricted in who you could have in your team and that there were rather few options, but I get why they did that. The atmosphere in ME3 is genius, many of the locations feel much more alive than in the previous games. What I noticed though is that the sheer scope of what they were trying to do with ME3 feels a bit much. Especially in the later part of the game some things feel rushed, which is a sickness many AAA games suffer from (Especially EA games). Sadly, it didnt feel like many of the decisions from ME2 or 1 mattered as much as for example in ME2, but that is something that can also be explained by the project being too big in scope and slightly rushed). I didnt really like the end of the game (As did many other fans), but I can accept it and still see the whole and acknowledge that even with its flaws, ME3 is still a good game.

So, to sum up:
Absolutely legendary trilogy: If you are into RPGs and havent played it yet, this is a must. A window into video gamings better days, right before it all went to shit.
Beware though, finishing it will leave you empty and emotionally unstable, similiarly to the feeling you get after finishing a long and good TV-show or book series.",1701776200,1701776200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, the first and second games are, from a gameplay perspective, really not good enough anymore. It was very static shoot-outs from behind protection, and often with far too little control also of that environment, creating stale and unengaging combat. This is mostly fixed by game three, but by then you already have to spend some 50-60 hours to get there. 

What kept me coming back, was the outstanding characters and story. Even though Shepherd is himself not a very interesting character (a real missed opportunity, in a game with such outstanding characters), his crew, the different civilisations, and the galactic story unfolding around throughout the games, are great. 

The story continues throughout the three games, so even though I have my qualms about the gameplay in the first games, I still recommend going through the whole game.

However, all of the games suffer from being extremely linear, extremely repetitive and have really bad cover-system type of combat. Hitboxes are inconsistent, enemy AI is really brain-dead and don`t pose a threat at all 99% of the time. Combat haven`t felt challenging, and was definitely the worst part of it. Story was decent, but overall very linear as well, with very little room for really important decisions. 

Going game by game:

ME1 was a decent game. While being old, it didn`t deliver much but it also didn`t over-promise. Maps were copy-pasted as well as enemies in them. But, being as old as it is, most of these things were not that bad considering the time it was created. 5/10

ME2 was the best of the trilogy, but still suffered from the same problems from the general feel of the trilogy. Stuff got fixed, but a lot of other things were made more tedious or worse. But, characters got better, story improved and overall the feeling was much better. 7.5/10

ME3 was a massive disappointed. Everything that made ME2 good was overdone or just outright buried below the massive filler fest this was. Lots of story loopholes, lots of dumb quests, lots of unnecessary cut-scenes and characters. I hated this one with my whole being, ME3 massively dropped my will to play the game, and I wanted to quit multiple times during the campaign. Just, no words for this one. Its a glorified under-baked soap opera. 1/10

ME3 is the sole reason this edition is not recommended by me. I cannot support something that killed a trilogy for me. I had very high hopes after ME2, but those were soon left behind.

ME1 is an oddball. Its gameplay is booty cheeks, completely messy, horribly boring, and samey exploration if you don't do stuff that sticks to the main story. The writing was still getting started, so almost everything acts as a foundation for the other two games, from worldbuilding to character establishment. The romancing is awful, you can lock yourself into a relationship just by being nice and wanting to hear your companions' backstories. The inventory management is AWFUL. The only reason why I didn't drop the trilogy right there and then was because I had curiosity to see how ME2 and ME3 would go, and frankly, I am glad I stuck around...

ME2 is great. Clunky and a bit dated, yes, but the gameplay still is decent enough to not be a detriment while the characterization is at its peak compared to the rest of the trilogy, the narrative is very strong and highly compelling, and the completely different vibe to ME1 in general, from gameplay, to tone, to even setting, makes it stand out a lot. I don't have much to say about it other than to give it high praise, and it feels like in ME2, Mass Effect as a whole truly started to shine. 

ME3 is... odd. It's good, very in fact, having the best gameplay of the trilogy (at least up until the endgame when it gets a bit too messy and spammy, almost feeling like ME1 in terms of clunkyness), and really strong, compelling narratives, from the continuation of all of the previous story arcs, to the introduction of new ones, to the best iteration on AIs I have seen in any media ever... I REALLY like ME3, even with its clunkyness here and there, it's a brilliant videogame. 

So, should you- YES. The entire trilogy is like 10/15 bucks on sales. Get it. I don't care if you need a stupid Origin or whatever they are calling it now account, this trilogy alone is worth it. Buy it, play it, have a grand old time, and have interspecies relationships if you're into that.

I played Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 and just didn't bother with 3. If I skip the first 2 games, why bother with the third in the trilogy. Even if it is good, the biggest draw of the story is gone. 

The two games show their age in the gameplay and the storytelling department. 

The gameplay is so awkward to control and doesn't feel great to play. You can't cancel queue up commands or cancel weapon swapping while in the tactical pause which just gets it awkward. The power cooldown just seems obtuse, at least for trying to equip elemental rounds putting a cooldown on your other active skills. Squadmates are dumb as bricks and you're always going to be needing to medigel-ing them on higher difficulties. 

The environment is dated and I'm not talking graphical fidelity. The directional sound for Mass Effect 1 was absolutely atrocious. For example, standing next to the main circular stage in the club on the citadel and facing a orthogonal direction has all of the music coming out of one side of your headphones only. And it's a small room. Even if it is in an open field with no sound wave bouncing, it would still be incredibly jarring. 

I would be far more immersed with the drawing point of the story but personally, I can't get over terrible ""editing"". You ever watch anything budget and in the script, it's written that someone is supposed to be cut off and it's super obvious? They say the last word of their sentence and don't even try to continue to make any more words or even seem surprised if they are interrupted. Instead they just stand there and look at the person that's supposed to interrupt for half a second and then that person remembers that it's their cue to start talking. That's this game. Actual story can be great but I just get pulled out of it. 

And don't even get me started on modding to fix how terrible this game is. The base game size is 100 GB approximately (I think). Downloading just QOL mods and community patches takes me to 15 GB. Grabbing graphical improvement mods can net me another 50 GB. And then to mod it, the program requires you to back up the game that you are going to mod, so there's another 100 GB on your storage gone for backup. After installing the mods (which isn't great, it isn't drap and drop nor is it vortex but also EA can just make a good game instead), you then have to install the texture mods. This process can take 30+ minutes and also at that point, you can't upgrade or add or remove any mods without re-installing the texture mods. That means that if you have texture mods and ever think you want to change a mod, you have to keep the downloaded mod file on your local disk on top of the changes that it makes to your game files. You end up with 300+ GB worth of Mass Effect on your PC. You don't need to mod all ME1+2+3 obviously and just mod the one you are on but still. It's kind of just a demonstration on the quality of this EA game.",1701481648,1701481648,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pretty sure everyone knows the gist of the ME trilogy by now. You're Commander Shepard and you carve out your story while dealing with the imminent reaper invasion. Memorable cast of characters and locations. The story, characters, and dialogue are what push the trilogy up to one of the best in gaming.


[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]
ME1 still feels pretty dated but all three have the similar premise of using cover, guns, and powers as you keep pushing through the locations. Sometimes there's vehicles to use but those feel like awkward to use most times. RPG heavy in ME1 with the weapon/armor looting, leveling, etc. ME2 went a bit more streamlined with the RPG experience. The third ME followed ME2's footsteps and kept the streamlined experience of a RPG design.

As you go through the games you can import your character to the next entry to continue the story of your Shepard. And there's several classes to choose for your Shepard that play differently enough to try other runs. Main classes are Soldier, Adept, and Engineer as well as three others that are mixes of the previous ones listed. Using your powers alongside your guns definitely makes the experience much better and is generally mandatory for the harder difficulties.


[h1][u]Difficulty[/u][/h1]
ME has never been a difficult set of games. Even on the hardest difficulty so long as you use cover properly, and use your team mates powers and telling them where to go, you can brush through the games with relative ease.


[h1][u]Graphics[/u][/h1]
By today's standards it's not all that impressive but back then the games were quite amazing. For the Legendary Edition itself I honestly wish the graphics got more of a boost in all three games. This is EA we're talking about.


[h1][u]Audio[/u][/h1]
The ME trilogy always had some of the best sounds and music. There were some weird situations with audio in certain points throughout all three games but for what they offer it's great.


[h1][u]Performance & Bugs[/u][/h1]
I did come across a few bugs though I couldn't say if they were ones from the original versions that somehow still got in this LE version or new bugs. Performance was okay. Felt like it could have been smoothed out a bit more in terms of performance but nothing you can do if EA doesn't want to optimize something as much as they can.


[h1][u]Summary[/u][/h1]
The ME trilogy is one of the most amazing experiences to go through. That being said this is still an EA game. So I can understand people not wanting to give EA any money. If you're really hesitant about buying an EA game wait for a sale. From what I recall hearing there are mods being made, or have been made, to help this release be a bit more polished.



[h1][u]Notice[/u][/h1]
This review, as with all my reviews, are my own personal thoughts and opinions on the game it is for. Whether I like it or dislike it / recommend it or not recommend it: it does not make it any more valid than someone else's view on the title. I also will not review a game based on a score system as those review designs are flawed. For example no game can be a 0 unless it's unfinished and unreleased and in that case can't be reviewed. No game can be a 10 because that would indicate perfection and no game is perfect. There's always flaws.

If I happen to like or recommend a game it doesn't mean I'm blind to any potential flaws it may have nor does it mean I'm going to defend or prop up the company that made it. If I happen to dislike the game or not recommend it that doesn't mean I hate the devs or the players who like the game. My reviews are about the game in question and not the players who like or dislike it. If a game is bad enough I will heavily criticize the devs and company. Not every game is going to appeal towards each person of which applies to me as well and in no way is there anything wrong someone liking or not liking a game.

If the game I'm reviewing is an online game, be it PvP or PvE, please use [url=https://steamcharts.com/]Steam Charts[/url] to see how populated the game is. You don't want to waste money on a title with no players in it. Just be sure to also take into account games that have crossplay like Microsoft titles. They usually have smaller player bases on PC but if crossplay is available then you generally don't need to worry about a small PC player base.

My reviews might be changed down the line if something gets altered in the game that would warrant an update to said reviews. I may update my reviews as well if I feel they can be done better. If you got all the way to the end of this then thank you for taking the time to read it all.",1637849842,1701358837,True,1,0,0.502762436866760254,0,True,False,False

An absolutely stellar experience from beginning to end that brought me back to my youth. A great tale to be had despite its noticeable blemishes, the stories told therein are incredibly enjoyable and the characters to adore.
As well, it is an interesting peak into the ideas of game development at the time and through various evolution of the cover-shooter genre, for better or worse, mixed with an RPG system that really makes me want to play Knights of the Old Republic again.

But the blemishes, they are noticeable. Often times frustrating.
To start, the animations leave a great deal to be desired. There have been numerous times, primarily in 1 but present in 2, where animations outright broke and impacted the game. Sometimes my character doesnt turn exactly and is 'frozen' in place with a loop of trying to turn and interfering with movement. Sometimes i'd be in cover, but the character themselves will be raised above said cover and vulnerable. In one moment in 2, I was even unable to progress because due to the application of a pull the enemy in question got stuck in the ceiling and I had to try and find the right vertex sticking out to hit.
I can't speak for Mass Effect 3 exactly, but these add to an air of jank that I quite frankly cannot recall having been present in the original 1 or 2. A blemish brought on by improvements from the legendary edition I imagine, but to be quite frank they are not too impactful. In my own experience, especially playing through these on insanity, the higher the difficulty you play on, the more noticeable they'll become. If you play on normal, they'll just be there. But its frustrating to die on insanity because my model was sticking out of cover and slowly sliding back into it. 

And let me reiterate, these are only small nitpicks. The only legitimate complaint I have that'd affect ranking would be small story elements in 3. And even then, these did not affect the rank much.

No more needs to be said, absolutely gets a crow seal of approval.
And to be quite frank, I'm glad we moved away from the game design idea of sticking multiple important functions on one button. You will be using space a lot.",1701345475,1701345475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This stellar masterpiece has not just elevated my gaming experience; it has transformed my very existence! BioWare, you've outdone yourselves, creating a cosmic saga that transcends the boundaries of space and time.

Let's talk about Liara, the embodiment of celestial beauty in this edition. Her character design? Utter perfection! Those radiant blue eyes and the way she gracefully navigates the cosmos - it's a visual symphony that has reshaped my perception of reality. And those assets! Oh, Liara's ""assets"" are a celestial marvel, defying the laws of gravity and leaving me in awe of the boundless wonders of the Mass Effect universe.

The graphical improvements are mind-blowing. Every pixel feels like it's been touched by the hands of gaming deities, rendering the Normandy and its crew in breathtaking detail. The updated textures are so vivid that I can practically feel the cosmic dust on my skin as I traverse the galaxy.

But it's not just about the visuals. The enhanced gameplay mechanics have redefined my approach to decision-making. Every dialogue choice feels like a cosmic ripple, affecting not only the fate of entire civilizations but also my very essence as a gamer.

The Legendary Edition isn't just a game; it's a cosmic odyssey that has become a spiritual experience. The epic soundtrack is the celestial hymn that echoes in my dreams, and the storyline is a narrative masterpiece that has rewired the neural pathways of my gaming soul.

In conclusion, Mass Effect Legendary Edition isn't just a game; it's a transcendental journey through the cosmos. Liara's mesmerising presence and those celestial assets have left an indelible mark on my heart, transforming me into a devout pilgrim on the altar of gaming greatness.

The story, the companions, the compelling main character, the choices that have actual consequences to the story line... it's all relatively unparalleled (with perhaps an exception being Baldur's Gate 3).

However I wanted to try a computer run, and to pop some of the steam achievements.  I will keep playing it on PC for now, but if I ever want to do another runthrough, I'll be going back to my X-box.  It's just not worth it to try to load the game through EA's dumpsterfire of a launcher.  My recommendation- absoltely play this game.  Just do it on a console so you don't have to go through EA's radioactive launcher.  It took me the better part of an hour trying to get the game to work though EA Launcher.  First it wouldn't recognize my account.  Then it wouldn't sync.  Then it just kept endlessly crashing.  Then it would try to load and nothing would happen.  Then it crashed my entire computer.  An hour of troubleshooting this nonsense that people have been complaining about since EA abandoned Origin for this idiotic new game launcher.  

I sometimes use video games to cope with anxiety.  I was on the verge of a panic attack when I started trying to get Mass Effect to work.

I don't know what to say, it's just a really cool game. The controls feel a bit restrictive and take some getting used to, and before that happens I don't think I'll be able to up the difficulty, but that's a personal thing. The game has excellent music, looks great and has a fantastic story, so do play it.

Edit:
I have now played the first game three times (once on Insanity), the second game twice and the third once. This really sucks you in, I tell ya. The story becomes bigger and the choices remain impactful throughout the series (more than you realise at first), with multiple surprises, horrors, humour, fun and frustration along the way and many opportunities to put frills on your playthrough with little side missions or draw and pad it out with thorough exploration. 
This game is VERY dramatic in all the best ways and filled with compelling characters. Like it should be in a good RPG.

Mostly perfect (although I still hate the conclusion act in ME3, but overall, it's superb).

Improved with every game release; the finale in ME3 suited the play style smoothly across all difficulties (although Vanguard is somehow broken with the Venom Shotgun).

Majestic AF and an important aspect of a good game.

It absolutely pains me to do this, but DO NOT buy this game. It is a great story, easily my favorite games, and it has countless hours of great fun and wonderful characters.

But FUCK EA. Their new EA App has completely made it impossible to run the game. It will not even open, and it has been like this for weeks now apparently. There is ZERO reason EA should need their app when I bought this through Steam. Until EA gets their useless ass out of the game, it is unplayable.

EDIT: There is a work around, kind of. Check inside the discussions and such for the game, and you will see it. I still cannot recommend the game out of spite against EA and their stupid, forced app, but at least the work around will let you play the game. For now, until EA puts a stop to it or something.

Edit 2: a recent update rendered the only usable work around as useless. So buy here via Steam at your own risk.

Edit 3: the EA App recently updated and now would at least TELL me what was wrong. Though it did say I had an incompatible version of Mass Effect (or more accurately, I somehow had two versions and one was not compatible with Steam), I was not able to find where the hell that was. Since I was already planning a system restore to clean up my PC and reorganize, I gave it another download. It now functions. Go fuckin figure.

TL:DR The EA App MIGHT lock you out of playing, but did not say WHY for the longest time. When it did, it took a full system restore to actually fix it because the issue was not anywhere I could find it (that I had two versions downloaded). The game is a great time and is well worth it for anyone who likes a story driven, reasonably fun third person shooter with memorable characters and a story that changes (at varying levels) with the many choices you can make. My rule is 1USD per hour of enjoyment, and I easily have hundreds of hours in this game between the old versions and these.",1678064903,1700950391,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I recommend getting the pc version even if you have played on console, because there are many awesome mods out there to use. I highly recommend going to nexus mods, getting the community patches, getting the diversity mods (which make the citadel feel more alive, adding more variety of npcs hanging around, like walking elcor, female turians, different coloured hanar, etc), the expanded galaxy mod, the take earth back mod, and the [spoiler] happy ending mod (if like the majority of fans you were disappointed with the ""choices"" of the final mission. It also restores Anderson's full final conversation.)[/spoiler].
There are other quality of life mods that allow you to skip minigames (I recommend these only if you have paid your dues by playing the games before), use only one probe for resource gathering, and bug fixes.

Choice's really matter in this game, and they have consequences which do unfold throughout the entire game series. 

Game play itself is from the 3rd person perspective, (making you think 3rd person shooter and technically yes the combat is just that, with a pause menu to issue commands to your team), however the depth of the game, the characters, missions to accomplish, levelling up and skill progression, emotions conveyed, and even the atmospheric music all sets the mood for one of the greatest rpg's of all time.

Up front, it does require the game be launched through the EA Store (formerly Origin). Also, the launcher for selecting which of the three games to play was pretty broken a few months back. It's working at time of writing (Oct 2023), but your mileage may vary.

The full run down:

Mass Effect 1 looks better and plays mostly the same (the various weapons now have different fire rates and properties, but the stats screen doesn't convey any of that info). The Mako is still hell on wheel and the autosave system is still an afterthought. However, it's MUCH more stable, I didn't get any crashing or glitches.

Mass Effect 2 is virtually identical to the original 2010 release, but all the DLC items are now found in the shops and not just given to you. The load times are like 1/100th of the original, which is nice.

Mass Effect 3 is unchanged expect there's no multiplayer (which is a shame, cuz the multiplayer was great).

You can start at any of the 3 games, but you cannot pick which ones to install, all 3 must be installed for you to play them, making this version a better choice for beginners / people starting over than for those who might want to continue from between games.
 
The games themselves are good, but are showing their age, even with the visual and gameplay touchups they got. What is particularly notable in it's age, I think, are the dialogues. They're pretty well written, as you'd expect from Bioware, but the direction wobbles between ""ok"" to ""jarring"", as the dialogue cutscenes frequently fail to transition cleanly between...what I'll call ""consequences"" dialogues, giving them this strange ""videotape cut"" feel to them.
 
Everything else from the games is what you'd likely expect from them. They're Unreal Engine (3) games, so any ancient machine should be able to go through these games with not much problem even with the remastered elements, though I'll note the small Mass Effect 1 issue of V-sync being slightly broken when traversing the planetary exploration maps with rather severe fps degradation.
 
Final note regarding Mass Effect 3: All multiplayer and companion app content got cut and the game's systems were rebalanced around this fact. Ofc, this being a good or bad thing hinges entirely on whether you liked/wanted the MP or not.

Having never played the original Mass Effect games and going in blind, this was my first introduction to the world. And I'm glad it was.

The Mass Effect trilogy has one of the most immersive, subtly funny, and unique worlds I've ever seen. Despite being quite old design-wise, it manages to do more things right than many modern games.
For one thing, the side quests are actually worth playing.
Additionally, all the side characters have interesting dialogue that changes and builds up both the world and their characters.
Even more impressively, the game design matches perfectly with the story. Particularly in the third game.

The world and characters are incredibly charming, and I often found myself chuckling at jokes or grinning upon seeing my favorite characters returning. I'm currently nearing the ending of my second play-through, and I'm still finding new things or smiling at things I forgot happened.
I cannot stress how worthwhile interacting with the world is in Mass Effect.

If I had to name one thing that annoyed me, it would be the ""space to run but also to hide behind cover"" controls in the second and third game. It doesn't make much sense and often resulted in me hiding behind cover when I was trying to run from an enemy.
That said, it didn't hinder my enjoyment much, as it was primarily a problem when I was already in trouble, difficulty-wise.

When it comes to the story, I have no real complaints. It felt as though my choices had an impact, not just in the cutscenes, but also out of the cutscenes. There were serious consequences to some of the choices I made which, though they might not impact the overall story, still expanded the world for me and me feel bad for making them.

Overall, I'd say it's best put it like this:
""It really makes you feel like Commander Shepard.""

Turns out I like 1, loved how the weapons felt, loved how playing Infiltrator felt and met fav character.
Turns out I like 2, Infiltrator built on the sniper fantasy, weapons felt great and loved how they did the system where weapons are unlocks, and fav character is still here.
Turns out I like 3, Infiltrator built more on the sniper fantasy, fav character is there still and was fucking amazing.
I did not fuck my favourite character. I'm too stupid to talk with the crew.

Spoilers ahead:
=====
Honestly, 3 felt the weakest for me, and it's amazing still. Story definitely was off at times, hated the scripted ""You lost the fight despite kicking ass"" moments. Weapons being unbound from class like in 1 was a good change, though I didn't like the weight system and ended up just using Sniper/Pistol. Most of the time, it was ""I only used one weapon because the weapon was best in slot"". Until that point, experimentation felt good though I did narrow down on ""Is this sniper bolt action, single shot and heavy hitting? Good"".
I still hate the fact that Legion died though (Small edit: Depends on your choices, died for me, might not for you). Legion was best Geth.

2 was genuinely a fun experience with all the extra crew, the loyalty missions, I enjoyed the story and doing things my way when possible. One thing that I remember more was the mission where everyone was being kidnapped, and you played a Joker, unshackling EDI. The suicide mission was amazing as well, and I love hearing about how every choice matters for it. Didn't kill anyone, didn't want anyone dying, and told the Illusive Man to shut up when I had the chance. Main gripe for me was the fact that weapon choice was limited to Sniper, SMG and Pistol, given the Infiltrator class. It ended up being ""Is this Sniper bolt action, 1 shot and strong? No? Go back to previous Sniper"".
Legion best robot, and I wish I had him for longer.

1 actually drawn me into the series more than I thought it would. Garrus was the favourite character right from the get go for me. Having all weapon types available felt right. Didn't use some at times, more focused on Sniper because heehoo Sniper feels good, but I did love the variety. It encouraged using different weapons. The weapon system was equivalent to a looter shooter, though with fixed bases, just progressing levels. It got me using different weapons. I actually experimented more than I thought I would and in turn, I loved using each weapon I tried out. Also committing war crimes with acid rounds felt good, despite the connotations that has.  
Garrus was MVP, Garrus best boy.

All playthroughs were mostly blind, only things I knew was things I found out during the mission from a friend, and I am extremely thankful for that too.
Try the game out. Try it blind. You won't regret it. It's a beautiful story driven RPG series which culminates into a satisfying experience.

I bought them when they first came out, and played them over and over. Now when Legendary was released I waited till there was a large sale (at least 75% off) to buy the games over again. It was totally worth the purchase of the game over again, mainly because I could use my steam launcher on the game.

The story is one of the best ever as far as games go, such a rich, in-depth history that makes it easy to be invested into the narrative of the games.

But what makes me keep playing even after finishing all three games is the mods I found on nexus to make it even more fun to how I want to play this game, making the replaying of the games totally worth exploring the many different narrative outcomes depending on the different choices you make.

ME1 has a great sense of exploration and wonder. While the gameplay can be awkward at times and some of the systems can be clunky, the Legendary Edition does a good job at fixing some of the game's issues to make it a bit more approachable. Given how the game presents its story, it does a good job at making it feel like there's a whole galaxy out there to explore, even if a lot of the explorable planets are just awkward vehicle playgrounds. Great writing, decent gameplay, overall a very memorable game.
Playing ME2 right after really shows the impact EA had on Bioware. Exploration and atmosphere are less of a focus, while gunplay and abilities have been tightened up. Much more of a TPS action game than a shooter RPG that ME1 was. While the overall story is clumsy, the individual characters and their arcs are great, and there's very few duds in the large cast. Still a lot of fun, but there are quite a few questionable gameplay decisions that hold it back from being great, and the strong cast can't shore up the overall story. The weakest of the three, in my opinion, but still worth playing if you're looking to try all three.
ME3 continues where ME2 left off structure-wise, but there's more focus on the main story as opposed to just the characters populating it, giving it a better balance. There's slightly more RPG elements than 2, but still not as much as 1, meaning it's still firmly an action TPS. Still a good cast of characters, and I find the overall story to be a bit cleaner, despite all the different elements that make it up. While the ending is a hot topic, even after all these years, I've grown more accepting of it as time passes, so I don't think it's such a let-down as to deter new players. YMMV though.
The amount of player choice in these games gives it a lot of repeatability, and in the end, it's up to the player if they want to take their time exploring the galaxy or simply rush from place to place, guns blasting. A real cultural event in gaming, and still worth playing now, despite its flaws.",1700785837,1700785837,True,2,0,0.516828298568725586,0,True,False,False

ME1 - Great game, Mako missions bit meh but honestly a great introduction into the Mass Effect series, heat sink was dumb but manageable. Paragon / Renegade were great ideas and really fleshed out Shepard as a character and the route you wanted to take.

ME2 - Improved on the first, Mako missions were replaced with more fast paced vehicle missions and heat sink for weapons was replaced with just regular ammo. They added more romances so you can finally romance best girl (Tali). Paragon and Renegade choices began to be more useful than just a bit of different dialogue. 

ME3 - My personal favourite, the DLCs were amazing (leviathan was a bit meh) but all of them were enjoyable and interesting. Loved the Citadel DLC, best one by far, more in depth dialogue and the characters got even funnier with a hint of self awareness. Most emotional game as well, ending felt satisfying (the one I got anyway) and by this point I was so hooked to the series that I got massively invested into characters. 

Overall this is one of the few game series I'd be happy to buy at full price, the fact you can get it massively discounted during a steam sale is absolutely amazing.

It does have its air share of issues, like ME1 still having its point of no return at Ilios without really telling you, and the game in general being littered with touch detection errors, causing you to get stuck in small corners, walls, or behind objects, effectively forcing you to load an old save/autosave to continue. Despite its bugs, the game still runs great and looks great as well.

As I'm writing this, I've just finished ME1. The game has great playability and even better story and cinematics. The only bug I've encountered, not being able to talk to Fai Dan after dealing with the Geth ambush, was easily resolved through saving and realoading.

42 hours in update: 
I just finished ME2. Probably thanks to the EA app the achievements are half broken. The upgrade and weapon system is very hard to orientate yourself in, because there are no stats. That also relates to the problems with kinda confusing loyalty and squad choosing for the last mission.
Customisation is an upgrade however, since you can choose your casual clothes and customize your armor. Regarding the story, there is some bad and some outright genius stuff. The begining was confusing at best. Project Lazarus imo was absolutely unnecessary for the story to progress. The ending though was epic. I will not spoil it, but from existential dread to the action, it was great!
Music in both games is also epic. The action really feels like it. Abandoned ruins or empty corridors are terrifying.

[h2] Now here comes the long rant [/h2]

It's always difficult to write a review of a remastered game, because it begs the question, what am I exactly critiquing here?

The Mass Effect trilogy is one of the best sci-fi RPGs of all time, made by BioWare in their absolute golden age. Having played the original probably 4 times over the years, I can tell you, this is definitely the game, you wish you could forget, so you could experience it all over again.

Having said all that, I have not once wished for a remaster during those playthroughs, [b] mainly because of the extremely talented and dedicated modding community. [/b] With a bit of patience, you could actually modify the games both graphically and gameplay wise to be up to date. Hell you can even change the ending to one that is not [spoiler] the absolute garbage abomination that we got in the first release. [/spoiler]

So to be honest, I wasn't so sure, why this remaster was needed, other than to found the studio after their catastrophic Anthem release. Sure, the first game was dated, even with mods, but I would say it added to it's charm. 

When this was released, it made absolutely no sense to buy it. Other than the first game, the original trilogy didn't need any graphical enhancement. Pair it with the bugs, the lack of mods and the expensive price, the lack of multiplayer, and with the broken achievements, due to the absolute s**tshow that's EA app, it just wasn't a good deal for someone who already played the originals. And I most certainly i would not have recommended it.

Now, after 2 years, I would say things are changed a bit. The modding community did catch up, and not only that, but the release has bought some new life to it. With that, most bugs, and annoyances are fixed (by the community...) and you can enjoy all the graphical, gameplay and story enhancing mods from the originals. After 2 years, they fixed the not so small issue, with the achievements, so you don't have to jump hoops with the now retired origin app method.

All in all, I would say, if you haven't played the original, or maybe started the first one, but were put off for some reason, it's now a great time to experience it. Buy it with a reasonable discount.

As a dedicated fan of the iconic Mass Effect trilogy, I approached this remastered edition with a mix of excitement and nostalgia. Little did I know that BioWare had meticulously crafted an experience that not only preserved the soul of the originals but elevated them to new heights.

From the moment the Normandy takes flight, it's evident that Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a labor of love. The visual enhancements are nothing short of breathtaking, breathing life into the rich and diverse worlds that Commander Shepard and their crew traverse. The updated character models, textures, and lighting make each alien species and human character more vivid and expressive than ever before. Even the Citadel, with its towering spires and bustling atmosphere, feels more alive and immersive.

The improvements extend beyond mere aesthetics. The gameplay enhancements seamlessly blend the refined mechanics of Mass Effect 2 and 3 into the original Mass Effect, creating a cohesive and polished experience across all three titles. Combat is more fluid, responsive, and strategically engaging, allowing players to relish every intense firefight and tactical decision.

The heart of Mass Effect, however, lies in its narrative, and Legendary Edition pays homage to this aspect with unwavering devotion. The emotional depth of the characters, the intricacies of the branching storylines, and the moral quandaries that define Shepard's journey are preserved with the utmost care. The inclusion of nearly all DLC content adds layers of narrative complexity, making the Legendary Edition the definitive way to experience the epic saga.

The remastered soundtrack is a symphony of nostalgia and new discoveries, complementing the epic space opera with a renewed sense of grandeur. From the haunting melodies of Virmire to the pulse-pounding beats of the Suicide Mission, the music is a captivating companion that enhances the emotional resonance of every moment.

Perhaps one of the most commendable aspects of Mass Effect Legendary Edition is its commitment to accessibility. The inclusion of a unified character creator across all three games, the option to skip the often polarizing planet scanning in Mass Effect 2, and the streamlining of certain mechanics demonstrate BioWare's dedication to making the trilogy more approachable for both veterans and newcomers alike.

In conclusion, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is more than a remaster—it's a celestial odyssey that honors the legacy of the original trilogy while redefining the standards for what a remastered collection can achieve. Whether you're a seasoned Spectre or a first-time explorer of the Mass Effect universe, this edition is an essential pilgrimage that captivates the soul and leaves an indelible mark on the gaming cosmos. Commander Shepard's legendary journey has never shone brighter, and the stars have aligned to deliver an experience that will be remembered for generations to come.",1700598760,1700598760,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is an incredible package and how i wish i could experience it all over again for the first time

I'll summarize my experience with the 3 games as such;

ME1 is the cult classic that went underappreciated and was way ahead for its time. Set the foundation for this franchise brilliantly but it sadly shows its age

ME2 is the spin off/side story that expanded the world and is probably my favorite (empire strikes back of mass effect). A slight nitpick is that they streamlined everything down, almost completely stripped the RPG elements but luckily the gameplay and story made up for it.  

ME3 is the blockbuster conclusion that fumbled a bit with its ending....... not that the endings were bad but it didn't feel like your actions directly influenced them like the previous game and it feels worse considering this is the conclusion to a trilogy. Apart from that they improved on literally everything and that citadel DLC was amazing and imo,  made up for any shortcomings and is probably the best DLC ever made

(based on first time playing on insanity difficulty)

ME1 - cant complain much was a good game with some good mechanics and ideas, story was good, game play was good, slight problem was mouse sensitivity. another problem was tali was USELESS, wouldnt take cover, follow or anything, only moved when teleported due to event or convos with NPCs. might have been random bug.

ME2 - ""look what they did to my boy"" meme comes to mind here, still good story they changed alot, few problems, again mouse sensitivity, a strange bug with powers hud, trying to select weapons or powers and you just waste medigel , but the thing that bugs me most is the running and cover mechanic is binded to same button, so your running for cover and glue yourself to the edge of cover not behind it, so annoying, happened way too often. other then that good game likes most of the changes to be honest. also the fact your own team blocks your retreat ALOT, i.e Right up your ass.

ME3 - right from the start HALF the choices you made in last 2 games mean NOTHING, and yet again changed alot again. the combat movement is a good idea but not done right, sometimes can be a pain, another thing ive ran into are monsters spawning on top of you.the ""solo"" mission is such a ball ache on this difficulty, maybe i got to it too fast or something but fuck me, its ANNOYING. you'll know the one once you get to it. boy oh boy if you manage to get to the fight at then end of that ""mission"" prepare to see the mission failed screen 1000s more times them before, when you have to fight spoiler and spoiler, such a shit show..

Overall - what a game, what an amazing game, honestly gonna miss all the crew, well worth is, take the time to listen and be a part of this universe.

gonna miss you tali <3

The universe created and developed for this series is outstanding and it will be a shame if nothing more comes from it (I haven't played Andromeda but by the sounds of it I don't want to).

If you can get around EA's wonky background app (which is annoying but not too hard), the Mass Effect Trilogy is amazing on the steam deck. It runs great, looks great, is the perfect game for being able to load it up anywhere to enjoy. In terms of needing to always be connected (thanks EA), you just need a connection to start-up the game. My advise: Keep it running and put your deck to sleep. That way you can start it up again and keep playing where ever you are regardless of an internet connection. Also, let's talk battery life. Since none of the games in the trilogy are super demanding, I usually get A LOT of battery life before needing to plug in, especially compared to a more demanding title like Cyberpunk.

If you are a Steam Deck user and see this game go on sale, buy it! Or don't wait. Given how many hundreds of hours of gameplay there are, and the replayability factor, just buy it!",1700506605,1700506605,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every other game I've played allows a launch directly from Steam. This one requires the use of an EA app which is balky and time wasting to start, and now prevents me from launching the game at all after just 36 hours of play. I've tried EA's app recovery, redoing password, relaunching, you name it... and I still can't resume playing again.

Update: I was eventually able to get back into the game but my comments on EA stand. It's also painfully slow to load even with an i7 processor, and frequently freezes, especially during combat. 

I have however found the game enjoyable. I'm more of an RPG than 1st person shooter, and this has both an engaging plot with meaningful choices and interesting character development. The extensive dialogue and cut scenes do limit its replayability, but I've tried both nice and nasty characters through ME1, one run through ME2 and have just begun ME3.

The first game is looking a bit aged now and is a bit slow for action game enthusiasts like me. However, the new enhanced version is worth playing to make decisions which can have consequences in ME2 and ME3. It has one of the most exciting end of any game I have played.

Mass Effect 2 is very much an action game. It is mostly about recruiting a team. And what a team it is! They are all fully rounded characters which you can genuinely like. It also builds up to an exciting final mission where there is a real danger of losing some of your ""friends"".

Mass Effect 3 is another action game. it uses he best features of both preceding games to maximise your enjoyment. There is some controversy about the ending but that shouldn't put anybody off.

Having played the games before the Legendary Edition was released, I wondered if it would be worth it. It certainly wasn't when it was £50! However, now it's cheap as chips and worth having for a cleaned up Mass Effect 1 and the renewed ability to import you character from ME1 to ME2 and finally to ME3.

You can play the three games individually as stand-alone games and accept the default conditions or use the interactive comic to change the major decisions. However, there is great satisfaction to bring you character through all three games and meet characters in different circumstances.

In the end, it's terrific value. It's a trio of games you can revisit again and again.",1700403543,1700403543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some people might think it's normal to just pick the guy but Jane Shepard really is a great main character so I hope you give it a chance. If you want to be a good or bad Shepard that is up to you. Someone recommended playing this way to me and I'm grateful so maybe can return the favor to another new player.
There are also good supporting characters, and interacting and going through the story is I think the main strength of ME1.(I've only just started ME2 at this time.) It also does a good job of either informing the player, or being intuitive, so you don't feel frustrated or the need to stop the game, go on google and have random people explain, as in a poorly designed game. It will reward you for spending more time analyzing and upgrading equipment, skills etc. but if you want to just keep playing, the game is friendly to that.
There is a main story, and side quests, and that's about it. If you are expecting professions and some random encounters/events when exploring like a skyrim rpg, maybe come back to this one when you just feel like playing through a good interactive story.

The MAKO Vehicle in ME1 remains the most aggravatingly annoying video game vehicles to control. It's almost as annoying as the EA Launcher. 
Why do I need to authenticate with a completely separate launcher to play a single player game EVERY TIME I PLAY. I split my gameplay between my desktop and ASUS ROG Ally handheld, every time I switch I have to authenticate again. Super annoying on a 7 inch windows tablet. Sometimes the 2fa code doesn't even arrive in my inbox. 

[h1]The trilogy remains as some of the best ARPGs ever made.[/h1]

Having said that I'm still going to recommend this game. For A$89 this product is an absolute steal. If you get it on sale even better. You get all the games from the trilogy + all of the DLC (Some of which were $$$pricey when they first came out). It's at least 100 hours of content at a minimum.

The first game is a bit dated even with the upgraded textures, Ultrawide support etc. Sometimes the dialog animations veer deep into the uncanny valley.  The other games are perfectly acceptable. ME2 Was a fantastic game when It came out in 2010, It still holds up to this day. 

Works amazingly well on the ROG Ally handheld so I imagine the SteamDeck will run it perfectly well (YMMV with the EA Launcher though, might not work with Linux. It barely works on Windows)

The combat hasn't aged as gracefully and sections of the series still feel under cooked compared to some of the great titles that have launched since Mass Effect's debut.

This remastered collection brings together the original Mass Effect trilogy, complete with updated graphics, improved gameplay mechanics, and all previously released DLC.

One of the standout features of Mass Effect Legendary Edition is the stunning visual overhaul, which breathes new life into the beloved universe of Mass Effect.

Incredible and epic storytelling, Characters, Gameplay, Music... almost everything is good. If you like games where choice matters, the Mass Effect Trilogy takes the experience to a whole new level, your choices are carried over across three games.

This is a technical review. There won't be any spoilers, summaries, or anything related to the game's story.

 [h1]Mass Effect:[/h1]
 [h2]""Is Submission Not Preferable To Extinction?""[/h2]
 [h2]-Saren Arterius[/h2]

The first game of the trilogy is an excellent start. The best in story writing

In contrast to the other two games, the first game's movement and combat have not aged well, even with remaster improvements.

The secondary quests in the game feel repetitive, and the planet exploration is not that good, most of it is empty, with some bases to explore. However, the story writing and worldbuilding make you overlook this problem, You will meet your first companions, who may appear in all three games based on your choices.

Overall it is an excellent game even though it seems outdated.

 [h1]Mass Effect 2:[/h1]
 [h2]""Information is my weapon, Shepard. It's good."" [/h2]
 [h2]-Illusive Man [/h2]

Overall the best game. With the best character writing.

An exceptional and truly unforgettable cast of characters, each one of your companions has its own personal quest that makes you want to complete every quest.

The side missions, exploration, customization, and combat have been significantly improved in this game. The final quest is brutal and many of your companions can die.

Although the game's plot is short and feels like filler, it is still great.

 [h1]Mass Effect 3:[/h1]
 [h2]""Stand in the ashes of a trillion dead souls and ask the ghosts if honor matters. The silence is your answer"" [/h2]
 [h2]-Javik[/h2]

The best in terms of Gameplay

The narrative in this game is exceptional, it offers a more cinematic experience. Your choices matter in this game, but some choices have time limits and can lead to character deaths, we have to make sacrifices too.
The story is great, but some choices are questionable. The ending is lazy and makes you feel that everything you've done to that point was irrelevant.

Despite its flaws in the ending, ME3 is a great game.


 [h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

Mass Effect is an exceptional Sci-Fi RPG trilogy, one of the greatest ever made. I recommend it to anyone seeking a captivating experience. If you like Star Wars or Star Trek, you will enjoy it too.",1699920160,1699921078,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Although I had never played this series before, I had heard great things about it.  So, when I saw it on sale for 80% off, I decided to give it a try.  This was my first foray into this franchise, aside from wearing the N7 suit in [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1238060/Dead_Space_3/]Dead Space™ 3[/url], and I played the full series on the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck]Steam Deck[/url].  Overall, it worked well, except for a slightly longer start-up time due to the EA launcher, and one hour of downtime when my internet went out (unfortunately, you have to be connected to play 👎) . The launcher automatically loads a Mass Effect launcher where you can then launch [b]Mass Effect[/b], [b]Mass Effect 2[/b], and [b]Mass Effect 3[/b].


[h3]Mass Effect[/h3]
Set in the 22nd century, this game combined various gameplay styles, including foot exploration, space and planet exploration aboard the Normandy, and planet surface exploration using the Mako. The story unfolded gradually, captivating me with its rich lore and excellent sci-fi writing. The unique planets and locations in the main quest kept things fresh and exciting throughout.

The only major downside was the repetitive bases, which featured only 4 base styles (mine, square, bunker, spaceship), differing only in their decorations and goals. Additionally, it wasn't until I explored the second-to-last star system that I realized there were hidden places to visit within the asteroid belts, and that information should have been made clearer earlier in the game.

Overall, it was a fantastic game, with great graphics, a vast universe, and an excellent story, where I spent a total of 45 hours playing.

[h3]9/10[/h3]


[h3]Mass Effect 2[/h3]
I began playing this game immediately after finishing Mass Effect (ME1).  It picks up shortly after the first chapter but truly begins two years later. The game let me import my ME1 character, carrying forward the choices I made in the previous game.  It also provided an interactive comic that summarized the events and choices from the first game.  These were both very nice touches!

Mass Effect 2 offered more squad members, planets, and places to visit.  One significant improvement was that each location I visited was unique, and I never saw any replicated areas. While some places were small and short, many of them were visually stunning and awe-inspiring or amazing to behold. Although the Mako was absent in this game, there were instances where I could fly a car, or an M-44 Hammerhead hovercraft, which added to the enjoyment, even if they were sparingly used. The star chart and space travel mechanics were significantly improved, requring the use of fuel and probes to explore planets.  Additionally, the foot combat was also upgraded, introducing ammo and reloading mechanics, which differed from the cooldown-based weapon system in the first game.

Overall, this was an excellent sequel with even better graphics, a larger universe, and more engaging story telling, where I spent 65 hours playing. However, as this instalment was a middle chapter in the story, I had to continue on to next chapter.

[h3]10/10[/h3]


[h3]Mass Effect 3[/h3]
I started this game immediately after completing Mass Effect 2 (ME2).  It takes place six months after the events of the previous chapter, thrusting you right into a grim invasion of the galaxy. I imported my saved character from ME2, but unlike the previous game, there was no comic to provide a recap, which was a bit disappointing.

A few changes were introducted in Mass Effect 3 (ME3).  Hacking and resource scanning was removed, and the only vehicle I could control was the Cerberus Atlas Mech, which only occurred a few times.  Nevertheless, the unique worlds still captivated me, and some scenes were truly excellent and outstanding.

This chapter revealed the final pieces of lore and history of the series, and the story was exceptional. Some subplots gave me goosebumps and even brought tears to my eyes, particularly when a squad member made the paragon sacrifice. The story almost remained perfect throughout the whole game. Almost that is, until the grand finale's choice of 4 endings.  [u]This is where the story [i]shockingly[/i] gave out[/u], as the choices were [i]unhappy, bittersweet, disappointing, or deferred[/i]. This [i]major let-down[/i] was a [i]massive strike against the entire trilogy[/i], detracting from an otherwise perfect game and trilogy, and impacting its 10/10 rating. 

Overall, and aside from the ending of ME3, the game's lore and history was well worth the experience, and I spent 52 hours playing it.

[h3]8/10[/h3]


[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328670/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition/]Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition[/url] is an exceptionally excellent Sci-Fi RPG trilogy. If you're a fan of sci-fi, Star Wars, or Star Trek, you will thorougly enjoy it. However, I would advise managing your expectations regarding the final choice in the game, and try to find a silver lining in it, even if it may not bring the closure you sought.  [i]If you're really in need of a better ending, you can consider using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffectlegendaryedition/mods/323]Audemus' Happy Ending Mod[/url], which may provide a more satisfying conclusion to this memorable sci-fi trilogy[/i].

Also - game wont start if you dont have EA App and it wont tell you directly about it. It will throw weird exception and steam thinks you have closed the game yourself. But theres more! Sometimes it will not launch EA App and throw the very same error.

I've tried playing ME1 a few times before and finally bought this thinking maybe I missed something and would give it and the rest of the trilogy another go. And I regret getting it.
I keep hearing people say the characters are fantastic. What characters? Shepard is left to being a pushover or a complete jerk, which is par for BioWare's lineup. And none of those choices ultimately matter when you can pick what you want at the end anyway. The rest of the team are completely forgettable. Now 9 hours in and I only remember Ashley's name because she looked mildly hot in the opening scene, which quickly faded when she opened her mouth. Actually I keep finding myself saying out loud for them to shut up when they interject their opinions. Which are so important that they say nothing on major decisions, before or after. The dialogue system, which I understand was supposed to be so revolutionary for being able to select what to say next while the conversation is still going, doesn't actually match what you end up saying. Fallout 4 took a note from this book. Just like how you have to announce you're going to fight others and beat your chest in conversation instead of just doing it. That's before we talk about how unbelievable the reactions and behaviors of characters are throughout the game. 
Okay, the plot. What plot? Bad guy wants to bring about universe ending thing and you hunt him down. There's several hurdles along the way and I keep finding myself wanting to just get this section done and hope there's not another mcguffin stopping me from getting to the good stuff. I still love how you're introduced to the Batarians like they're the well known evildoers of the universe when you come across some random one's schemes. Okay. Just roll with it I suppose.
The game is very glitchy. I understand ME1 came out in 2007, but these couldn't be fixed by now? The load menu for selecting which game doesn't allow controller input and acts odd in general. Enemy projectiles pass through walls and terrain (most easily noticeable in the Mako sections). My computer barely holds 40 fps when it can run Cyberpunk 2077 at 60 fps with ease on the same resolution and high graphics. There's so many places to get the character stuck, especially in combat, that I avoid even entering cover for concerns that I will get locked in and killed. Enemies will utterly skip all animations and pop back into cover or teleport altogether to several feet away in every fight. I'm used to being ready to shift my aim quickly for it now. And while not a glitch, who thought being able to sprint for 10 ft before huffing and puffing was a good idea? Deus Ex: HR ran with this idea too it seems. It's extremely annoying, just like the boosters on the Mako that do literally nothing. Your screen gets stretched and there's camera shake, but you don't move any faster. I also love the touch of all these systems where the overwhelming majority you can do nothing with except the same random encounter map if you hunt around enough.
I feel like this is like GTA3. Where it's a bunch of poorly made systems, but because there's a variety being presented, it's greater than the sum of its parts. That along with rose colored glasses for those who enjoyed this as a kid. I'm a minority in thinking ME is dreadful on all accounts, but if you liked it in the original releases, you might like the refreshed graphics (did they really need to keep such a tight skybox around the Normandy's cockpit though?). For those who never played, I don't know why you'd bother when there's so much better out there. But maybe you're like me trying to find the hype, thinking it's one of those games where ""it gets better after X hours"" or something.",1699422526,1699422526,False,4,3,0.324820071458816528,1,True,False,False

Simply check out his vids on Youtube. Overall, the critic that I can sum up with this series is as Raycevick puts it: 

“The universe Bioware created outshines the game itself.”

The characters, the world, and the best moments of ME make up the very heart and bulk of the experience. Bioware successfully wrote some of the best characters and moments in gaming that you will truly invest time into knowing them and bringing them along your journey. And Bioware was completely aware of their writing and able to create many very self-aware and hilarious dialogues and one of, if not the best fan-service DLC that ever existed. The Milky Way galaxy is also such a living world that Bioware filled with all the established lore, world hubs, little moments and conversations you encounter throughout the playthrough to immerse yourself more into the world and grow invested into the stakes and characters beside the main quests.

All 3 games have their own strengths and weaknesses. There are the janky combat, often contrived writing and drama, unclear dialogue wheel, over-simplified moral system, wasted potentials, not so great reasoning of plot points, cut contents due to troubled development throughout all 3 games, but these faults here and there didn’t hinder me enjoying the best moments and the satisfaction of my cumulating choices. As of personal preference the cohesive narrative that progresses along the playthrough in ME1&3 suit me better than the combination of different short stories in ME2.

The legendary edition did a fair job in overhauling ME1 janks, but ME2&3 is practically an official texture and resolution upgrade, some minor bugs and visual inconsistencies still exist. 240 fps in ME3 is bugged and not usable since it stops your shield from regening. Though it is still a clean remastered experience, albeit a bit lazy tbh. But no matter how good it is, it is still fucking irredeemable that this single-player experience requires constant internet connection to play AND you need to connect and remain online to the shitty EA app. Which means: If your internet rests in peace or EA’s NASA branded potatoes went to the oven, you are not playing the game…which it happened to me once when EA had an explosive diarrhea and it is frustrating. It is not consumer-friendly and nonsensical. Fuck this shit.
 
All and all, to the series itself, I would confidently regard Mass Effect trilogy as a masterpiece of Sci-Fi videogames series and one of the best to date. And after my trilogy playthrough I reinforced my belief that ME3 endings and Andromeda were major missteps made by Bioware. Instead of realizing the mistakes they made with ME3 endings, they decided to ditch all the efforts of the vast universe and characters of the Milky Way galaxy that the ME1-3 team made. They instead soft rebooted it with a new galaxy, without properly realizing how immensely difficult it is to create somethings that pack the same charm and thoughts the original Bioware team came up with. And on top of that still focusing on the oldcomers from the Milky Way, which in the end created a very shallow and unimpressive game of Andromeda. It would’ve been more sensible if they decided to make a prequel about a lot of unexplored characters stories or events with the already established lore and source materials than spending 2 times the effort for creating something people may not grow as fond as and be as good as the original.

Either way, what’s done is done. The Mass Effect universe still leaves a lot of rooms and potentials for both sequels or prequels. But I swear to god I beg Bioware for the next ME. Treat our beloved characters good. They’ve been though a lot with Shepard and deserve a proper return. Not character assassination nor fan fic reiteration.

Anyway, what was i saying? yea Ashley is not as bad as people thought although I still ditched her for best girl Liara. And I fucking hate the batarians. Disgusting spider-eyes freaks. I never understand why the council let these vermins live. I would slam dunk the batarian babies into the Omega 4 relay and……",1699328086,1699408623,True,3,0,0.543600261211395264,0,True,False,False

It is unfortunate that the third game was rushed, because it was honestly my favorite of the series. Here's a brief overview, and then I'll go more into detail:

Highlights:
* Interpersonal dymanics are incredibly enjoyable.
- In ME2 and ME3, combat is just chef's kiss.
- Enemies don't respawn.
* A lot of ME2 and ME3 is hand crafted, and highly detailed (understatement).
- The portrayal of other aliens was endearing.

Mixed emotions:
- The arrival had one of the best fights in the game. But you don't get credit for winning it.
- The world and lore feels somewhat alive at times, and at others dead.
- The equipment mechanics are odd. Especially the armor. Some things can only be worn as a set, others as pieces. Can't just take enemy guns. Gun stats not always fully explained. But there are still some things I like about it, I mean, it does definitely change the experience and it's fun to seek them out.
- I enjoyed exploring space, but you don't really get to witness many alien cultures outside of brief mission areas and shops.

Low points:
* The ending of ME3 was AWFUL. And you can only get a satisfying ending with mods.
- The beginning of ME3 undermined everything you did in ME2.
- Various things you did in ME1 and ME2 don't matter as much as you'd like in ME3.
- ME1 exploration areas not pertaining to main quests were just AI generated and boring.
- ME2 put too much focus on resource collection, which loses its appeal after a while.
- Once again, the ending of ME3 was horrible.
- The messaging in ME3 is confusing.

Now, the mass effect trilogy was one of the best gaming experiences I had overall. There were so many intense, action-packed fights and cutscenes that just filled me with ecstasy. Especially in ME3, such as with the Krogan fight. You play the role of an intergalactic soldier throughout the game, and it's very easy to fall into that from a roleplaying perspective. The battles are captivating, and you really do feel like you're in danger at times. But for a game that you would expect your choices to impact, they basically don't, which is tragic.

In ME2 we don't really see the humans gaining more power, despite you dismantling the old council and the humans being given the upperhand. There are various inconsistencies with the beginning of ME3: first, your entire squad distanced themselves from you and none cared to stick around for you or even send word to you throughout your trial. Not even your love interest. Guns should've been returned with the Normandy, along with your armor. You start dreaming about some irrelevant kid for no good reason because you see him briefly. A singular reaper in ME1 and ME2 was so powerful that everyone almost died, but there's supposed to be hundreds in ME3 and they're all portrayed as practically instinctual predators and not super powerful beings. 

That rachni queen you killed in ME1? Yeah, doesn't matter, they're still using rachni through some made up space tech explanation and Krogan. Those geth you killed in ME1 or ME2? Doesn't matter because they're still around, even in ME3. Destroyed the premature invasion signal in ME2 with an asteroid? Doesn't matter because they're all going to attack in ME3. Befriended the leviathan in ME3? Doesn't matter, they're basically irrelevant to the story and ending.

The messaging is problematic. Let's start with the Geth: Legion claims that he will allow you to destroy the Geth, but then attacks you if you actually do, which you probably will unless you save Tali's questline for one of the last. This means that Legion, and Geth as a whole, prioritize their own survival above all, which is canon and makes sense given what we know about them, regardless of how Legion would like to portray it. One could make the argument that Legion is only working with Shephard because of his prior victories, and sees him as the winning side.

Then comes the part everyone hates: the ending of ME3. They introduce the starchild, which is so obviously an evil reaper trying to manipulate you. In this game, there is not a single indication that the AI can be trusted, besides the Normandy AI who arguably isn't completely free. And you're a soldier who has dedicated their life just to stopping them. How in the hell could the dev team say that the synthetic ending is the good one? All endings are horrible. We can assume by even seeing the starchild that indoctrination has begun. Opting to control the reapers means you get indoctrinated. Opting to turn everyone into AI is disgusting and means that you basically live in this pretend blue pill-esque world where everyone loses their consciousness and identity meanwhile everyone is being devoured by husks.

So logically, of course I chose to destroy the reapers once and for all. But stupidly, instead of it just destroying the mass relays and the reapers, you die (unless you have like 100% achievements but still) and your friends are stranded far away from you. No word about the lives of krogan, or any of the other aliens you saved, and the whole thing is just rushed, botched, and does such an injustice to all of the good parts of the game leading up to that.

And all that being said, the experience excluding that was still so fun that I'd love a ME4. Just please, do not botch the endings. The concept of a game series having choices that impact games to follow is amazing, but those choices need to mean something. The gameplay was really fun, and the cutscenes were cinematic and movie-like. The aliens were cool.

Great story, great/lovable characters, fun gameplay, meaningful choices, great visuals, great audio, great replayability. 
I have played and completed this trilogy a dozen times. On consoles when they first launched, this edition on console and finally this edition on PC. This time with mods and I didn’t think this could get better but with Expanded Galaxy Mod, textures and QoL mods it is an absolute masterpiece.

 There is one thing that it doesn’t tick green on, and that is the dreaded EA launcher. I was unable to play this game for over a YEAR due to the EA launcher never wanting to work. I tried every troubleshoot in the book. It showed I owned this on steam but not on EA’s dumb app, always telling me to download or repair. Over the span of a year I tried everything: un/reinstalling the game, un/reinstalling ea app, repairing game/app, nothing worked. Finally the only way I found out how to play this was to get EA’s stupid monthly subscription and download ME:LE off there, it finally worked.

It's one of those games that makes you wish you had the ability to wipe out your mind to experience it for the first time all over again. 

Like being enthralled by The Thorian, but without the collateral.

This is arguably the best trilogy from the best Sci-Fi franchise in the history of vidya. And now, it comes packed in a big bundle of joy with all the preexisting DLCs included, QoL changes, and technical improvements we would expect of a remaster deserving of that title.

Which means we don't have to worry anymore about compatibility/performance issues like before with the original versions.

We can also say goodbye to the hassle of downloading and installing each DLC separately (remember that ME2 has a ton of DLCs) because EA did not include those in the old ""Deluxe"" edition versions, which is just what you would expect from EA....

Something of great value too and worth mentioning is that all the mods I can think of that are considered ""must"" while also being vanilla friendly have been ported to this edition as well.

And trust me, even for those who are not ""mod friendly"" I would still encourage them to take a look at Nexus mods. 
It is well worth the effort just for the sheer amount of quality stuff there is to improve the experience and add things that we can argue should've been there in the first place.

There also seem to be quite a fair amount of bugs from the originals that carried over to this edition, so even if you're not friendly with modding I would still advice to at least check the Community Patches. 

I would go as far as to say they're mandatory if you want to experience this trilogy with the minimum amount of bugs and with all the improvements and love the community has given to these games.

But what about the actual games, you might ask? Well, I'll let you experience that for yourself. No it's not that I'm lazy. Well, I am, but I also don't feel like spoiling any details. 

It's just what I did back then 10 years ago when I first played Mass Effect; I jumped in completely blind, and was wholly rewarded for that!

I'm just going to say that it is an epic journey in a magnificent universe. A one way trip, quite literally, like the Suicide Mission. 

You'll make friends and enemies along the way, and ultimately form an unbreakable bond with your crew mates like no other games have managed pull before Mass Effect came along.

I've taken a moment from my duties—battling Reapers, uniting species, and sometimes deciding the fate of entire planets—to bring you my report on ""Mass Effect Legendary Edition.""

Having lived through the original journey, saving the galaxy from the brink of extinction, this remastered edition is like reliving my greatest hits—and the low points—with sharper visuals and smoother combat. It's a chance to retrace the path of the Shepard you choose to be, with every decision, every alliance, and every sacrifice rendered in stunning detail.

The Legendary Edition stitches together a tapestry of a universe so vast, so alive with lore and heart, it’s as if you could reach out and feel the heat of Tuchanka’s sun or the cold sterility of the Cerberus labs. The relationships I've forged—whether friendships or rivalries—now resonate with renewed clarity, the bonds forged in fire and starlight stronger in high definition.

For newcomers to the Normandy, welcome aboard. You're about to embark on a saga that'll challenge your ethics, your strategy, and your capacity for compassion. For veterans, it’s a polished return to a beloved universe, where every enhanced texture and tune rekindles the embers of past glories.

However, not every FTL jump is smooth. The journey can sometimes be hindered by remnants of old design, a stark reminder of the trilogy's origins in a previous era of gaming.

This report concludes with a personal note: ""Mass Effect Legendary Edition"" is my most beloved in the armory. It’s the saga at its best, a chance to relive my story, our story, with the reverence it deserves. We were born to do this.

TLDR: A 9/10 for its day, and still a solid 7/10 or better.

PROs:
   - Novel combat mechanics.
   - Balanced and satisfying combat (on normal difficulty)
   - Scalable combat difficulty
   - Good story.
   - Great voice acting.
   - Good sound.
   - Great RPG mechanics.
   - Varied and interesting NPCs join your team.
   - Well done cut-scenes, of appropriate length and frequency.
   - Cut-scenes reflect who is really in your party at that time.
   - Neat ""dialogue wheel"" mechanic
   - AI (friend and foe) tactical behavior reasonable for 2007.
   - Good art
   - Non-irritating music.
   - There is romance to be had if you make careful dialogue choices.

CONs:
   - Conversation branches can sometimes be repeated. If selected by mistake, you get to listen to the excellent voice acting twice.
   - Sometimes getting around the Citadel seems like a walking simulator.
   - Searching planets in ME1 can get old by the time the game is done. (ME2 is better.)",1698978181,1699016052,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mass Effect Legendary Edition comes with all 3 Mass Effect games. Mass Effect Andromeda is not part of the Legendary Edition.

Depending on the difficulty you play in the gear distribution and Squad/Party comp matters alot. If you played Baldur's Gate 3 you will see the similarities just like I do. I could go more but there is no point to it. 

Mass Effect games are one of those games that will be timeless and a must-play if RPGs are your thing. Mass Effect games are classics.

absolutly my all time fav. it changed my opinion on shooters being boring and had some of the voice acting and companion interactions in the game.

my only recommendation is to do at least 1 playthrough on a female shepard if you havent the voice acting is amazing even if you dont do romance. My biggest compliant is in the legendary they took half the achievements out to streamline them. only need insanity on one of the 3 games now :( and you loose the tracking for who you had most often in the ground missions ending in an achievemnt to get all of them as 1# at least once.

but those are minor complaints

my only warning for people is the ghosting is really bad on old monitors it actual led me to upgrading to one that has the lease amount of ghosting I can find. it was expensive but its stunning how much better it made games.

google ""UFO Ghosting"" to see how your monitors ghost prevention skills are going. getting it minimized or removed almost completely made almost all my games look better not just mass effect.",1698884920,1698885577,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I may be the last person on Earth to play the Mass Effect series, which begs the question of who I'm writing this review for.

But this trilogy is really extraordinary. Almost* without exception, the writing is outstanding. The alien races are wonderful. Their stories are brilliant and frequently moving. The voice acting is all top-notch. The unpopular original ending of ME3 is the stuff of legends, and it's still there.  I can understand why people would have been furious at it at the time, but the improvements they made for this edition left me reasonably satisfied. All I will say about the ending is this: I'm so sorry, Jack.

I do think that ME2 is the highlight of the series from a main story standpoint.

The extra EA launcher is definitely gross, and I could probably reinstall my computer and still not be totally convinced it's completely gone. But at least I didn't have any of the problems getting things to load like others have reported. The game was smooth and more or less bug free. I experienced maybe one crash in 120+ hours of gameplay.

I played as an Infiltrator and the gunplay was highly enjoyable throughout all three games, despite the differences between them. Many game systems seem to get simpler from one game to the next, which is weird. Usually things get more complicated as a series progresses.

*Almost. The ""romance"" in the first two games is utterly cringe-worthy. (I'm aware this is a minority opinion. Don't @ me.) I was essentially gaslit into a relationship that I never wanted in the first game, and in both the first and second game, displaying basic courtesy toward most members of the appropriate gender results in a harem fighting over you. The heavy-handed nature of it was such a shock compared to the deft writing of the rest of the game. But I was extremely pleased to have a very different experience in ME3 where Shepard was finally able to develop meaningful non-romantic friendships with opposite-gender characters. The stuff in the Citadel DLC was particularly good. (And, as an aside, Grunt at the party is one of greatest scenes in gaming.)

All in all, despite small flaws, this is an extraordinary game and its echos can still be felt today. I recommend it without hesitation.",1698813825,1698813825,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, the story is brilliant.  It is worth playing just to see the story unfold.  These kinds of games with cutscenes in them are like playing a part in a movie to me.  And the movie was outstanding.

Second.  I played this game on linux.  Electronic Arts does not make it easy.  Sometimes suddenly the game would not start.  Removing all the compdata for that game and re-verifying the game files seemed to get the game operational again without losing my progress.  If they haven't fixed the problem and you are playing on linux it helped to disable everything you can in the EA Game Overlay or disable it entirely if you can figure out how.

The balance of the game is good.  Easy is pretty easy, you can pretty much sit back and enjoy the show.  The AI is good.  Your teammates will back you up sufficiently but hang back and let handle plenty of enemies at the same time.

I got the Legendary Edition with all DLCs on sale on Steam and I HIGHLY recommend this game.  I don't know how you get a superstar like Martin Sheen to play the ""Illusive Man"" but he was brilliant of course.

All the DLC content is well integrated into the game.  You could hardly differentiate the DLC content from the original game.

Things that could use improvement:

I've never seen game designers that don't want their content to be seen.  In this game, the designer does not make it easy to find everything there is that can be done.  They seem to think that people don't mind wandering helplessly all over the galaxy map to find these objectives.  They are wrong. 

Thus they inadvertently hide content from players.  For instance you will get a message claiming there is something to be done on so and so planet but it may not tell you the cluster and/or system the planet is in.  This one simple addition to all communcation on what needs to be done would be much appreciated.

Mass Effect 3:
The Armax Arsenal Arena DLC is great for testing your gear and your teammates behavior.  Necessary because the weapons rating system is weak.  Instead of giving you numbers like this weapon holds 6 rounds with a force of 100N each they give you a bar which isn't even accurate.  They give you an information icon to find out information on weapons you already own but NOT those for sale.  The information is flowery but lacking actually useful detail also as above.",1698588436,1698588436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing through ME1, it is meh. The graphics are generally pretty good, but all of the characters have cold, empty, dead eyes and completely lack facial expressions. It is pretty cursed. The gameplay is pretty boring. 50% of the game is talking to people with a poorly designed dialogue UI. Another 40% of the game is walking around or driving a tank; both are sluggish, tedious, and don't handle well.

Music, story, world building, and visuals are decent. Definitely not a bad game, but for sure a dated one. I'd suggest watching a let's play instead.

Finally being able to do so was one of the best feelings I had in gaming.

Even outside of that, the story is ambitious, the points land, the final mission of the second game is one of the greatest missions of all time, and nobody is spared extensive characterisation that the DLC (all included in this release) expand on brilliantly. This is a game that genuinely has everything. You can see the influence games like Gears of War had on the third game - for the better, where the combat was nearly perfected short of some annoying instances of input.

It's also rare I'll say this but the Steam Achievements for this game are perfect too. I played from Mass Effect four times before this release, but the Achievements for this one forced me to learn and perfect aspects of the games that I had neglected before. By the end of the game I felt like an absolute God, and that I had genuinely mastered Mass Effect - so great decision by all involved there. Achievements that don't just reward you for completion but also act as an expert-level tutorial are the perfect kind, in my opinion.

A lot of criticism has been given to the ending of this one, with some citing previous drafts as possibly superior, other's lamenting that it didn't hold up to (sometimes explicitly stated) promises. Let me say without any spoilers that I think the ending is completely in keeping with the overall themes of this game, and is fully worth the journey. I only wish the Leviathan DLC was better integrated into it.

If you're a sci-fi fan, buy this game. If you're a role playing fan, buy this game. If you love a good story, buy this game. If you love a decent tactical shooter, buy this game. If you love a good time. Buy. This. Game. You will NOT regret it.

This is actually a really easy review to write, because I’m in no danger of overselling things. This is the finest space opera ever written (yeah, I’d rate it higher than Star Wars). It’s the most influential RPG of the last twenty years (yeah, I’d rate it higher than Skyrim). I’ve played it four or five times. I am certain that you’ll love this game.

I have a single piece of advice for newcomers - play as female Shepard. Jennifer Hale’s voice acting is iconic, her range and talent perfectly expressing the incredibly varied emotions demanded by the complicated storyline. Male Shepards are voiced by Mark Meer, and props to him for a good effort, but he just doesn’t compare.

For those of you that already own the Mass Effect games in some form or another, this is a far more difficult product to recommend. The problem is that this isn’t a very good remaster - more of a convenient bundle. The original games still hold up just fine, so unless you have an obsession with graphics, why buy this?

Beyond that, there are quite a few technical issues - squad powers frequently glitch, and I got stuck on more ladders than was comfortable. Most egregiously, buying this on Steam forces you to go through the always-unpopular EA launcher. This is a fairly dodgy offering by modern remaster standards - look at something like the Master Chief Collection, and the paucity of this product becomes apparent. It simply doesn’t fit the price tag.

[b] ME1 [/b]
It's an old game, it has a lot of design flaws that are extremely obvious, but the story is worth playing it through IMO. There's a lot to hate and a lot to love, so i'll make a list of it for ease of reading.

Like:
- The story is great. Most characters are unique and have interesting back stories, and the way the story is built up both creates closure for the first game and sets up the story for the second game. I'm convinced you play ME1 for the story first, gameplay second.
- Enemy diversity is pretty decent for such an old game. I liked fighting all enemies, there were none that felt more annoying than fun.
- Voice acting. Everything is voiced.
- Weapon customization is pretty good, there's plenty of mods and ammo types for different gun types etc. Some are very noticable, some are useless.

Dislike:
- Vehicle movement is horrible. The fact that you need to drive a lot to get to POIs and collectables doesn't help.
- Inventory management isn't the best, and in the later parts of the game the loot becomes irrelevant, even on the highest difficulty.
- A lot of repeated room layouts. There are, if I remember correctly, only 2 different layouts for most POIs that are not main story related. There's boxes and stuff to make the routes different, but the maps are all the same.
- No way to revert skill points.

It took me 35 hours to beat with all ME1 related achievements. Some of them are annoying, but none are a real grind and they all have ways to easily grind them out within 20 to 30 minutes. There's no way of tracking your progress in these achievements which makes grinding annoying as you don't know when something triggered or not, but it's still doable.

[b] ME2 [/b]
My god, what an improvement over the first game. Playing ME1 is definitely worth it for the story, but also to make ME2 that much better. A lot of systems are redesigned, some better and some worse, but it just plays and feels awesome. Can’t wait to see how ME3 turns out.

Like:
Story continues from ME1. A lot of choices you make in ME1 and ME2 have results in the form of messages you get in your private terminal on the Normandy, which makes you feel like your actions matter.
Combat feels great, enemy variation is good, highest difficulty level actually has some tougher moments in this game.
No more mandatory vehicle gameplay! It’s still in the game, but completely optional. I skipped a lot of the vehicle related missions and still got all the achievements.
I loved the focus on teambuilding. Made me learn a lot about every one of the 12(!) companions. They’re all unique and interesting.
Skill point remapping. Good.

Dislike:
Weapon customization is dumbed down a lot. You can choose different weapons, but that’s it.
Farming materials via scanning planets is a grind I did not enjoy. I fixed this by downloading a mod to speed up the process, but it should be enjoyable without mods.
No minimap for most areas is a shame. Also, no keybinding for opening the journal to quickly check quests.

It took me another 35 hours to finish ME2. This includes all achievements but skips some DLC/side missions that did not get my interest. Also, trackers for achievements exist now, which helps.",1697379995,1697911376,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As someone who disdains Nu Bioware, loathes EA, and has bottomless contempt for the idea that games need to be retooled for the sensitivities of a modern audience less than a decade after their original release, I pretty much expected my review to be simply, ""Should have just called it 'M Effect' because they got rid of the ass. >:(""

But the anticipated bowdlerization turned out to be extremely minimal. Barely noticeable even if you're looking for it, honestly. The bigger impediment to my enjoyment by far was the mandatory and spitefully inept EA App, which occasionally annoyed me by eating my Steam achievements and several times exasperated me by refusing to launch the game at all, sometimes for hours. Also lamentable was the exclusion of Mass Effect 3's multiplayer which, despite having come out at a time when so many single player focused games included a multiplayer mode as a mere box checking exercise, bucked that trend by being thoughtfully integrated into the game's overall galaxy at war premise as well as just being a whole lot of fun. I'm rather ambivalent about the reworking of the first game's shooting mechanics. While I did enjoy being able to more smoothly pop in and out of cover and devastate enemies with headshots, the purist in me would actually have preferred a more faithful warts-and-all rendering, and yet another part of me is still just sitting here thinkin' 'bout Matriarch Benezia's fat, veiny Blue Suns, so whatever.

Gripes aside, all in all I found it a very decent way to revisit a classic if uneven trilogy and can give it a cautious recommendation. Maybe not at full asking price, but you're probably okay to grab it on sale for 14.99 Weimar Amerikanmarks or your local equivalent, which you frequently can do.",1697862422,1697862422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Después de trabajar en [b]Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic[/b], el equipo de [b]BioWare[/b] se sintió tentado a elaborar su propia ópera espacial abundante en lore y argumento, y con toda la experiencia acumulada en tantos años liderando el género [b]CRPG[/b] supieron dar lugar a una de las franquicias más reconocidas de su década.

Poco había (Y sigue habiendo) en los videojuegos que represente con tanta fidelidad a este subgénero de la ciencia ficción, y mucho menos que destace por tal peso narrativo. Vas a notar diferencias mecánicas sutiles entre cada título, pero en términos generales son tan similares que me parece perfecto haberlos acumulado en esta Edición Legendaria que, además, los remasteriza sin trastocar aquello que los hizo tan especiales.

[b]Mass Effect[/b] cuenta con uno de los universos más ricos y abundantes en diversidad folclórica disponibles en el medio, cada especie tiene sus hábitos y se destacan de forma consistente y cohesiva a lo largo de los tres títulos. Escenarios como [b]Omega[/b] o la [b]Ciudadela[/b] son muy interesantes de investigar y explorar en búsqueda de alguna mejora o algún diálogo, y hasta leer el códice o las notas repartidas por el mapa tiene su interés.

Y al igual que con el campamento en el futuro [b]Dragon Age: Origins[/b], la [b]Normandy[/b] funge como un centro común para nuestro pelotón y miembros, con quienes podemos interactuar, ayudar, mejorar nuestra relación, prepararnos para su respectiva misión de lealtad o comenzar un romance, que tienden a ser historias de intimidad muy interesantes y que, al igual que gran parte de las decisiones clave, son exportadas a los juegos posteriores para continuar con tu mismo personaje.

Con respecto al rol, éste no se ve particularmente reflejado en los eventos clave del argumento. Los grandes acontecimientos van a fluir sin importar qué, sin embargo tus decisiones impactan en el modo en que esto ocurra y tu lugar como jugador define esencialmente [b]quién es tu Shepard[/b], si sereno o agresivo, de quién se enamora y cómo opera junto a qué pelotón, a quienes puede llegar a perder en ciertos momentos si no tomamos las decisiones correctas. Si bien no vamos a vivir experiencias sumamente distantes como si de [b]Detroit: Become Human[/b] se tratase, [b]Mass Effect[/b] sí logra que las buenas o malas decisiones sean compensadas o castigadas dentro de su universo y que esto se conserve a lo largo de los tres juegos.

Por desgracia hay varios aspectos que quizá podrían haber sido modernizados en esta nueva edición.

[list]
    [*][b]El combate y los tiroteos.[/b]
[/list] 
Continúan siendo emocionantes y únicos gracias a la customización del armamento y los poderes, pero los tiroteos continúan toscos, propios del 2007, a ratos incluso carentes de feedback. Por otras parte, la acción también puede provocar una sensación de repetitividad. Por mucho que adore las misiones de lealtad de Mass Effect 2, su estructura es [u]narrativa > tiroteo > narrativa[/u].
[list]
    [*][b]Las animaciones.[/b]
[/list]
El trabajo de animaciones corporales es fabuloso, pero por momentos se nota el uso forzado de animaciones repetidas. La expresiones faciales también son extrañas, habitualmente tiesas, pero considerando que son juegos bastante longevos es fascinante lo mucho que lograron con tan poco y lo rápido que se te olvida.
[list]
    [*][b]Puntos clave débiles y recursos narrativos pobres.[/b]
[/list]
No me malinterpreten. [b]Mass Effect[/b] es una maravilla sin igual en lo que a argumento, narrativa y trama respecta; no obstante no se salva de un par de momentos de debilidad, como [spoiler]el viaje de [b]Shepard[/b] antes de la misión suicida en [b]Mass Effect 2[/b], mientras que [b]Joker[/b] prepara el [b]Reaper IFF[/b], que convenientemente deja a la [b]Normandy[/b] sin nuestra disposición para combatir la invasion que da lugar al secuestro del personal de la nave[/spoiler].
[list]
    [*][b]Algunas falsas decisiones.[/b]
[/list]
Existe un par de decisiones que sugieren ser de gran importancia para futuros acontecimientos, sólo para terminar siendo irrelevantes, tal como [spoiler]la decisión final de destruir [b]la base de los Segadores[/b] o entregársela a [b]Cerberus[/b][/spoiler] o [spoiler]la poca importancia de tus decisiones en el infame final de [b]Mass Effect 3[/b][/spoiler].

Importante destacar que algunos de los DLCs (Obviamente incorporados en esta edición) son fabulosos, no podría imaginarme a [b]Mass Effect 2[/b] sin ""[b]Lair of the Shadow Broker[/b]"", por ejemplo.

También hay otros puntos minúsculos para comentar, como la imposibilidad de enfundar el arma y la desaparición del pirateo/derivación en [b]Mass Effect 3[/b] o lo fascinante del diseño e historia de todos los acompañantes de [b]Mass Effect 2[/b]; pero ya estamos entrando en terreno pantanoso del que sólo se puede hablar con constantes spoilers y la idea es disfrutar de esta trilogía legendaria por cuenta propia.

Mass Effect 1 Review;

Okay first of all what a masterpiece this game is and a great way to start the series of games! Yes it is an older title with its quirks (I absolutely HATE driving the Mako ground vehicle which feels very clunky) but I was pleasantly surprised how much ME1 has pulled me into the series! The character progression and companion system is awesome! Some of the choices I faced really made me think about what to choose and made me use real human emotion towards some of them (I actually regret some of my choices after starting my ME2 play through but I own my mistakes... I guess!)

I will go as far to say that it made gaming exciting for me again!

[CURRENTLY PLAYING] Mass Effect 2 Review;

From the get go there is action and you can really feel the upgrade between the 2 games from graphics, dialog, systems, features etc. (I WILL TRY TO AVOID SPOILERS BUT BEWARE!!!) The fact it pulls over all my choices from ME1 is a fantastic feature and just adds onto the excellent character progression I mentioned in my ME1 review (I knew of this feature but was unsure if it took effect). The little catch up comic which featured all my ME1 choices was an excellent addition and even with the option to skip it I would highly recommend sitting through it because it really is excellent.... and I am not normally a fan of cutscenes.

I am currently assembling my team and making my way through the galaxy to do so visiting more planets and meeting many more characters than ME1 so far and I am really looking to playing more

Rushed, forced, disconnected.

Combat is all right and in some ways expanded upon. However, it's like they tried to turn the game into some sort of ""Call of Duty: Mass Effect Warfare"" action-packed hybrid and it just takes away from the core identity of the game - in my opinion.

Small changes have been made on purpose to levels in mass effect 1 but personally as a long time fan I feel they have been a positive development.

All DLC is included apart from Pinnacle station, you probably wont miss it, but if you do modders have restored that as well at this point. 

If you're new to the series I'd recommend buying this version.

Дуже рекомендую всім без винятку, хто є фанатом цієї серії, як і я.

In a single player game, no less. Credit where it's due to Origin, that program had an offline mode.

At the time of writing, there are methods to bypass the EA App and revert back to Origin so you can get offline access for use cases like metered connections and platforms like Steam Deck. But who knows how long it will be before that's made unavailable? This is an unfortunate case of piracy being the preferred option.

This sucks, because there's a wonderful remaster here, barring some missing DLC and some minor censorship, both of which can be remedied with mods. The work that was done to remaster the assets of ME1 alone deserves a lot of praise and financial support, but due to EA being EA, I can't recommend buying the game on PC. Either pirate it or buy the game on console.

For what it's worth, The standalone Mass Effect 1 (arguably the best ME anyway) is available to buy on Steam and doesn't require any needlessly restrictive third party apps between Steam and the game you bought.

But the combat is still good, the graphics are still brilliant. And the story? Oh, so much story. This still remains the best Space Opera RPG ever made. The world building, the side stories, and the villains, seriously, those villains...

A comparison can probably be made with Game Of Thrones. Huge cast. Beautiful production values. Great story telling, and an ending that makes you go ""WTF? They made me wait all these years for ... this???"" I believe the main writer was changed between episode 2 and 3, and it shows.

- ME1: Shepard's aim direction freezing and refusing to follow the camera. The bullets fly where they should, but Shepard doesn't look that way.
- ME1: Game crashing after a phase of fighting Saren. Shepard then has to fight him again.
But at least there are no more shadow people on Noveria.
- ME2: Shepard levitating after using Charge. This also causes enemies not to target him.

Individually, each game has simplistic writing, but when played as a whole, the cumulative impact of each decision you made is felt throughout the series. You saved some rando in ME1? They have something for you in ME2 or ME3. Bioware did a great job tying things toGETHer. 10/10 story, 6/10 gameplay. The story of the series is better for me than witcher 3 + dlc, and that's a tall order. I would also argue that ME is better than star wars in the sci-fi setting. 

You will feel the age of the series in ME1. it was an absolute struggle to finish ME1, but well worth it. For me, the fact that you can fully customize the weapons and armor of all your companions was great, just poorly implemented. They also give you too much medkits. The biggest shit stain in ME1 is exploring the planets, and running out of stamina while in a safe zone. Seriously, why make on-foot travelling so hassle?

By the time I got to ME2, the quality of life changes are great. They simplified equipment, and instead made upgrades a pain in the ass by adding resources. At least majority of the places you visit has a fuel station so you can travel to each system and scan for materials. I think I spent just as much time, if not more, scanning planets for materials, than shooting aliens. Gunplay and general mechanics are the same, but they did change how health works. No more 40k medkits lying around, you just regain health. Medkits are still used, but to revive allies. The gap between ME1 and ME2 is huge. By far the best improvements to writing and character dialogue. This game had the most companions of the series, and the best 


ahh ME3. What a blast. I'm not a fan the new health system, and the cover system fucked me over a few times, but nothing deal-breaking. Endings were implemented a little poorly, but I am satisfied with the epilogues. No more resources, thank fuck, and a little more customization with weapons and armor. Good balance with what ME1 and ME2 had. Gun play and general mechanics are still the same.

Велика сага, прописаний світ і приємні компаньйони. І фінал... Якого краще б не було.

Подібних речей мало. Згадується недавнішня Брама Балдура 3 і всього.

Окремо по частинам:

МЕ1 (7 з 10): вступ в сагу, динамічний, з декількома сильними моментами і вцілому прописаним світом.
Навіть умовний Мако мені сподобався - прикольна перебивка між стрільбою і є шо про досліджувати - покататись. 

Хоча звісно це анахронічний дизайн і певні рішення в бойовій системі просто не працють.

МЕ2 (9.9 з 10): гра про тих самих + нових компаньйонів. Вони дуже вписані в світ і з ним перетинаються, аналогічно як один з одним. Багато приємних діалогів і ігролад довели майже до піку його можливостей.

Мінуси банальні - деякі шмати інтерфейсу по типу: ромаснів чи вікі в діалогаїх краще б мати. А то запам'ятати якогосб чела з рандомної планети якого я врятував в першій частині - складно.

МЕ3 (3 з 10): ну бойовка на піку, режисура на піку, візуал теж. 

Але ВСІ вибори гра зводить на нівець. 
Деякі компаньйони не мають продовження історії - суто обрубок і живи з тим.
Фінал і взагалі спосіб вирішення проблеми Ріперів... Ну без матів - поганий, просто тупий, нецікавий, затичка і т.п.

Могла бути б найкраща ігрова серія, навіть якшо брати максимально низкі очікування, ну поганий фінал. Для гри, що трималась на прописанності світу і напарниках - прям ппц погано все зводити до просто ""ну ок фільм на 30 годин"".",1696484211,1696484211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My only complaint is this needs to connect to the EA launcher because of that I don't think you can play offline and the obvious downside of needing another launcher that spams ads to you and scrapes your data. Personally I am a launcher minimalist especially if they are from less trust worth companies I think just want my data.

I recommend playing through then uninstalling to get rid of that EA launcher garbo that is what I'm going to do. Its just a shame you can't play this is the internet goes out.

Sure, it’s not a perfect release when you look at the current batch of next-gen titles; however, it is a playable one, and if you’ve missed this universe or you’re a newcomer, there’s some exceptional value for money in the Mass Effect Legendary Edition that will literally give you hours upon hours of enjoyment and yes, there is some frustration, depending on the difficulty level you play but In my own words.

To judge just how good it is, I challenge you to find at least one negative review that is complaining about the game itself and not about the EA Launcher (you will likely have a hard time).

Story, characters, gameplay, music, visuals are all great. The assembly of the three games into one is very smooth and plays almost like a single game. Some of the decisions made in the first game impact the third one in a big way. There are very few bugs. There is almost no filler content (apart from the planet exploration in ME1).

This game makes you think about big questions, what's important on the grand scale, and how one person can change the fate of the whole galaxy. Many people find the ending(s) controversial, but I found it very fitting.

You know that time when you play a game, and after some point you just want to finish it and start paying less attention / possibly skipping some conversations? Well, for this one, I only got that feeling near the end of my second playthrough, which is a lot of hours in (200+?).

If you wish you can check my review for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/recommended/17460?snr=1_5_9__402]Mass Effect[/url] and my review for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/recommended/2362420?snr=1_5_9__402]Mass Effect 2[/url], where I ""talk"" about Mass Effect & Mass Effect 2 as ""whole"" games.(unfortunately I have no Mass Effect 3 review, since I own it on EA App, not Steam, and there's no way, at the moment when I am writing this, for one to review a game there, but you can check my [url=https://www.metacritic.com/user/Ciocolici]Metacritic profile[/url], and search for the Mass Effect 3 review)

The improvements in ""Mass Effect: Legendary Edition"" are extensive and commendable. The first game, Mass Effect 1, receives a major gameplay overhaul, and all three games benefit from impressive visual upgrades and bug fixes. While the remaster enhances the overall experience, there are still some issues worth mentioning, which I've compiled into a detailed guide for fellow players to optimize their gameplay. I highly suggest you [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2583863570]check it out[/url].

One glaring omission is the lack of a FOV slider in a 2021 remaster, a feature that modders quickly provided as a fix. I find it puzzling that BioWare didn't include such a basic option. Additionally, the EA App Overlay negatively impacts performance in ME:LE, a frustrating carryover from the original games.

Remastering the ME trilogy posed a unique challenge, considering the extensive modding done by the community. However, BioWare managed to surpass expectations by delivering a remaster that not only matches the originals but also outshines the heavily-modded versions.

Mass Effect 1, in particular, stands out with its stunning visual overhaul. The game's environments are breathtaking, and the reworked Mako adds a new level of enjoyment to planetary exploration. The cinematics have been vastly improved, though I did have some reservations about certain character appearances. Nonetheless, the overall transformation is impressive.

However, despite the enhancements, there are still lingering issues, such as stuttering in certain areas like the Citadel. Although it doesn't ruin the experience, it's a disappointment to encounter such technical hiccups in an otherwise polished remaster. Additionally, planetary exploration with the Mako sometimes triggers FPS drops due to what seems like optimization problems.

Mass Effect 2 also benefits from visual upgrades, even if it didn't receive as much attention as the first game. The removal of Black Crush enhances the game's visuals, though I wish the cinematics had received a bit more polish to maintain continuity with the first game. Nevertheless, ME2 still looks significantly better than the original version, despite some new instances of stuttering and FPS loss.

As for Mass Effect 3, it didn't require as many improvements, but the overall enhancements make a difference in the gameplay experience. The better textures and lighting elevate the visuals, providing a satisfying remastered experience. However, I encountered unexpected FPS drops on the Citadel after a particular mission, and the Silversun Strip also suffered from FPS loss and stuttering.

Despite these performance issues, ""Mass Effect: Legendary Edition"" remains the best way to experience this beloved trilogy. It's an outstanding remaster that showcases a considerable amount of effort, particularly in Mass Effect 1. Plus, it comes at a significantly lower price than the original trilogy with all its DLCs included.

For achievement hunters: the game 127 achievements. Many from the original games, some changed to be easier (I am looking at you ME1). Doing the achievements in ME:LE is way easier than in the original games, for some of the achievements at least. Still, it is not an easy task, but if you love Mass Effect, you will have a blast doing them. And unlike the original ME1 and ME2, ME:LE has them integrated on Steam. Hooray!

While the removal of a specific ME1 DLC and the multiplayer aspect in ME3 may be debatable, it doesn't detract from the overall appeal of ""Legendary Edition"". But the bad optimization/fps issues in some areas are something that has to be fixed, and I am sure it will with future patches. Whether you're a new player or revisiting the trilogy, ""Mass Effect: Legendary Edition"" is the definitive way to enjoy this unparalleled gaming experience. The trilogy's remarkable narrative and captivating gameplay have stood the test of time, making ""Legendary Edition"" a must-play for all fans of the Mass Effect universe.",1629833717,1696197729,True,4,0,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,False

The ol’ Wild West of retail lol). I probably poured around 1,000 hours in the first two games getting all the possible outcomes, leveling up, getting all achievements, etc. 
Then the third game came out. I only played through it once or twice. I really got into the multiplayer, and while I didn’t think the ending was as bad as the internet made it out to be, I did feel very empty when replaying the third game. 
Then the legendary edition came out, and I fell in love all over again. So many things happen in the third came that really seal the deal on so many plot threads and so many character arcs. The combat is better than ever, and quite honestly, it’s better than quite a few games that are still being released today. I got chills, I gasped, and was shocked. It came from a game that I had played like 10 years ago and somehow after all that it still felt new and fresh. Above all, it felt satisfying. You got to love it, gentlemen! 

Disclaimer: I will be eternally grateful that sh*tty EA allowed for there to be as much work done to the first game. These are just some things I wish they could’ve done. 

ME2 forcing zoom while in cover during combat instead of having a blind fire or just a pop out and shoot without the camera zooming in has always bothered me a lot. It didn’t do it in the OG ME1 so I don’t think it’s ever been intentional. The mini game stuff and power cool down stuff can be taken care of with mods. I wish there was a mod for the one thing. 

The other thing is color filter rendering modes that are available in photo modes would be awesome if we could just leave them in at all times. Every single-player game should have this as a standard. It really helps keep environments fresh on that 20th play through. 

The other thing has been touched by virtually everyone. Multiplayer. I would pay to have Mass Effect 3 multiplayer as a DLC. (Don’t worry, I’m ready for the hate.)

I bought the Legendary Edition because is was ""remastered and optimized for 4K Ultra HD"" (I game at 1080p) thinking that, after all this time, they'd at least update the game engine (game play) and the previous games (MEs 1 & 2) would be brought up to the level of ME3.  Well, I was wrong.

As far as I can tell, this is only a visual update.  It is pretty nice, but definitely not worth the full $60 release price.

All of the game play issues of ME 1 & 2 are still there (getting stuck in ME1 so that you'd have to load an old save to continute), movement issues (ME 1 & 2), etc.  ME 3 still plays like ME3 did, but it, at least, had the best gameplay.

If you can get this on sale at 50% or more off, it probably would be worth picking up.  It is currently on sale for 80% off, which, to me, is a no-brainer.

Anyway, it was fun to play through again, but it'll probably be the last time for at least a long time (until I get nostalgic again a few years from now), if ever.

For what it is, I'll recommend this game, but not at full price.  If they had brought the game play of MEs 1 & 2 up to the standard of ME3, then I'd wholeheartedly recommend it, but they didn't.  IMO, they treated it more as, ""Let's update the textures to 4K and improve the colors a bit... DONE!"" money-grab than an effort to really ""remaster"" it.  Surely, it couldn't have taken THAT much more to update the gameplay/game engine in the earlier versions to justify the $60 release price.

Go elsewhere if you want to complain about apps and broken steam achievement all those things are true but if you have been a PC gamer since the early 90's then you dealt with this and far far worse.

I have just finished Mass Effect 2 and whilst I will probably finish the trilogy I will do it with no appetite whatsoever.

I did not play these games when they originally came out and based upon all the hype and my love of classic games these have been on my must play list for some time. Get the legendary edition on sale win win.

However be warned despite the tags saying ""RPG"", ""Story Rich"" and ""Choices Matter"" these games are none of these things.

Let's take these one at a time.

RPG. So starting to play either 1 or 2 you start off and the games feel a lot like Knights of the Old Republic. It's a Bioware game so they are building on a great legacy. Fantastic KOTOR is one of the best games ever made. I am going to love this. So all the ship based and any non mission based planetary play are good. You get to move around pick up missions buy stuff and talk to people. So far so RPG. sadly once the missions start these games expose their true nature. This is a cover shooter pure and simple. It is not a very good cover shooter and sadly if you are not a fan then you are in for a long ride. The biggest problem is that you are taken out of cover for apparently no reason but on top of that your squad AI is so bad that about 20% of the time you will be shooting allies and believe me they will complain. The next problem is that the game starts off giving the impression that this is a save anywhere game. It is on PC so yes finally a PC port which does not suffer from it's console parent. Well they fooled me again. Once on a mission you are back to checkpoints. You get to save once in a while and if you die right before a checkpoint back you go to do the same thing over and over again. This had me turn down the difficulty not because the game was hard but just because I didn't like shooting my party in the back of the head and then dying only to repeat more of the same repetitive game play again. If you wanted to not play a cover shooter. Tough it is the only way to play this game.

Story Rich. LOL. I don't expect my video games to be life changing. I don't expect them to be full of nuance. It is supposed to be fun after all. But the hype around this game was massive. Many people saying it has the best story ever and it affected them a lot. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE. If you have read any sci fi then this will probably leave you cold. part 1 is OK in this respect. I sort of got what I was expecting. It is very much your Star Trek Planet of Hats trope. You have your war alien. You have your spec ops alien you have your science alien and you have you sex alien. Nothing wrong with that a lot of good science fictions uses these tropes well. Sadly the problem is that they went so far as to include non humanoid races. Sadly none of the non humanoid races are more than background colour. Every squad member or beyond card board cut out character has two arms two legs and presumably genitalia in the right place. so very yawn. Anyway I played Mass Effect 1 as a straight paragon. Which was actually a pretty good morality system. Gone is the Light Side Dark Side of KOTOR and we have paragon and renegade. No right or wrong choices...... Well at least until you play Mass Effect 2 where even though I am playing as a paragon it turns out I was playing it wrong. Whatever you do it seems you are railroaded into a renegade character. You are not really a commander in the military and whilst it fits the spectre moniker it really makes little difference in the end you are a pretty much a hard arse loose cannon who gets things done. Illusion of choice. Don't get me started on having to work for Cancer Man from the X-Files in Mass Effect 2. Control did it much better in a much more polished game.

Choices Matter. Well this review is already too long and I will probably only play Mass Effect 3 for the achievements so maybe choices will matter in that game (although as most people seemed to hate it I suspect not) With my 50 hours in the game I can only really tell that one choice mattered and that is in the first game and will determine the fate of one character. As far as I can tell the choice only matters based upon maybe a couple of missions and some small cameo appearance in Mass effect 2. So more ""1 Choice"" matters but not that much.

Conclusions. 4 / 10
It is kind of like James Bond in space. Do a mission, kiss the girl, save the world. Enough if you are 13 but not really enough to scratch a Sci Fi RPG itch.

If you want some great classic game action I would recommend lots of other games/series which are as old or older. Why not try KOTOR, TES3 Morrowind or The Witcher. All are better than this.",1695642063,1695642063,False,1,1,0.407048463821411133,0,True,False,False

So, It was an amazing experience, but with some nuances especially taking into account that this game is pretty old and some mechanics feels odd or outdated now.

So ME1 seemed to me as vacuum cleaner simulator, since all that you're doing there - is travelling around absolutely the same rooms/hangars/corridors and cleaning'em out. Sometimes driving space all terrain vehicle and getting through the mountains to get to another room/hangar/restroom to clean it out as well.

About ME2 I've heard that it the best part of the trilogy. But when I've completed it - my impression was a bit different. Basically, story line structure is worst then it was in NWN with its ""find four words of power or in KOTOR with its ""find four star maps"", so in ME2 the structure is the following:
- intro (1 mission)
- assemble a team (6 missions)
- 2nd story mission (after intro)
- assemble a team a bit more (3 missions)
- ???
- the end

And it feels like ""piss off with your desire to follow the story, and go talk the dumbasses to take part in it, and maybe we'll show you a cinematic in the end"". All you do - is hanging out with your teammates, dating with your gf/bf, and gazing into infinity of space sipping another beer, and very rarely moving the story forward.

So, ME3 - it is Syberia (that old old quest, yes, lol) in more large locations, where you constantly poking around the locations or the planets, trying to find NPC or anything that could trigger some quest to progress. Quest descriptions are brief and doesn't have any updates after you've moved a bit further than initial instructions, and this is total crap. And only in this ME part I've noticed that when you change an armor - some stats also changes))) And also I've laughed out loud when the main story goal is to complete the space dildo, like it was in Austin Powers)))

But jokes aside, it was a great experience and a I've had a lot of fun going through the Shepard's story, despite a really old game mechanics that hadn't been updated in this trilogy edition (which is sad).

[h1] Graphics: 8/10 [/h1] Not as good as I'd hoped. Now don't get me wrong - it's a HUGE improvement over the first game, a decent improvement over the second - and a teensie tiny one in the third, but it's still the old low poly models with a better paint-job.
[h1] Performance: 4/10 [/h1] Absolutely awful, even though I have a pretty decent PC and managed to get over 80 fps most of the time - they would just plummet at random points for no god-damn reason.
[h1] Story&Characters: 9/10 [/h1] Still what I remember - and the highlight of these games, arguably the best story driven game I've played.
[h1] Movement/Combat: 5.5/10 [/h1] A spawn of Satan, just like the original. They fail to make a pleasant cover system - and it only worsens with each game. HOWEVER, the combat part of it can be quite entertaining with some cool combos and weapons.

If you're new to the trilogy, then this is definitely a good way to experience it, plus it includes all of the DLC (aside from Pinnacle Station because apparently they lost the source code for that (but a mod exists on Nexus that brings it back)). I'd still recommend the MEUITM and ALOT texture packs because they add additional enhancements to make the game look sweet.

I only had a short play time when I first posted this review. i started my playthrough with Origin/Game Pass, but I got it for Steam as I now run Linux and also wanted to play it on the Steam Deck (it runs great on that, btw, should run just fine with Proton Experimental). It's a solid Mass Effect experience - a great time from start to finish. They ironed out a lot of the jank for Mass Effect 1, though 2 and 3 don't feel much different to the original release - but that's a good thing in my opinion. Shame they removed the multiplayer mode from Mass Effect 3, though, because that was a lot of fun. All three games run smoothly with no noticeable performance issues. 

TL;DR: If you own the original trilogy, either skip this or get it on sale. If you're new, this is the way.

Edit: Also I meant to add: Legendary Addition adds native controller support. The original trilogy did not so that might win you over if you prefer controllers over keyboard/mouse.

Edit 2: I've now finished Mass Effect 3, and yeah, it all stacks. I maintain my positive opinion on this.",1681731994,1695280042,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

My thumbs down is due to the inclusion of Origin (originally) and EA online. It means that I've downloaded a game that simply won't function when EA is having server problems. Or when the push an update that isn't ready. 

Also: as I'm playing through the Legendary Edition, which includes all the DLC; I'm finding out a LOT more of the story. EA's DLC cash grab screws players.

I wish... Don't get me wrong, ME is a master piece and you owe yourself to play it.
I enjoyed any minute of it, I just wish it got the love it deserves, not just this lazy re-bundle.

This should have been called ""Mass Effect Repackaged Edition"".
They just slapped the 3 games and their DLCs in a launcher, yanked HDR to make it look a bit better, and sold it at new release price point.

I understand more was done, they added achievements, level cap to 60 and changed Miranda booty service camera angles... But when my mako gets stuck in a slope texture insta-killing me like did ME1 a few years ago, ME3 crashing on class selection or not recognizing my controller mid game, you see how lazy this repackaged edition is.

Speaking of HDR, the option is hidden in the launcher for ME1 and ME2 and you need to toggle it off also inside ME3 game options. They couldn't bother to have a setting consistent between the 3 games ? Oh, and having HDR prevents you from taking screenshots with F12 on Steam. Freakin' bravo. Besides HDR, visual upgrades are nonexistent.

A truly Legendary edition would have been to have the 3 games fused together with ME3 graphics, but that would have implied Bioware is still capable of daring endeavors.

Do yourself a favor and buy this repackaged trilogy at a 80% discount like I did, which is the price matching the actual effort that was put into it.",1695208440,1695208848,False,15,1,0.601653456687927246,0,True,False,False

The general premise of the games is that they're light RPG third person shooters with some ability-centric squad management. First game starts off rather dry, gameplay-wise, with really odd design ideas of hybridizing RPGs and FPSes, like all the dropped by enemies gear is automatically put into your inventory but also there's limited inventory space and you gotta go trough each item. But it's got it's moments. Later on the gameplay gets smoother and more varied with each game. Say ME1 classes are three unique ability sets and then three hybrid classses - meanwhile starting ME2 they become their own thing, say previously merely engineer and soldier ability receiving infiltrators become actual infiltrators with stealth and means to beat enemies with surprise attacks and sniper rifles. The companions get unique abilities too, minigames and setpieces also get more varied.

The series bigger highlights are definitely making big choices which can be transferred to a new game even, and the worldbuilding. The choices are usually just two options and not that deep and complex as you'd expect from an RPG, but the way how they stack up creating extremely distinct stories is genuinely cool and really alters the story in major ways. Worldbuilding is also lovely, a detailed space opera with culturally distinct species with histories, coherent pseudoscience to justify scifi tech, and fun tidbits here and there.

Now, with later games most contentious elements was EA's brazen monetization and the underwhelming and rushed finale. Seeing how this one was reworked to feature ALL the DLCs (except one for ME1 whose source code was lost), including extended cut for story and cinematics and loads of goodies, it all feels rather... generous. Multiplayer and spinoff app usage isn't forced onto players either, anymore - which is good as both are dead. Unfortunately some seemingly ancient bugs still remain unfixed and probably were never a priority in the first place.

Definitely recommend this, hell of an experience. Just don't hesitate skipping most of ME1 planet landing side quests, they're very raw and mostly unsatisfying.",1695079503,1695079503,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I highly recommend this game to anyone who has considered playing Mass Effect or currently owns the original titles separately for a number of reasons. The first and most obvious reason is because this contains every last ounce of DLC besides a small fan favorite from the first Mass Effect game called Pinnacle station. Second, the improvement to graphics is noticeable and has set a new standard for remastered titles moving forward. Third, and most importantly to me, the developers went back and fixed as many legacy bugs as they could before launch. A game this size will always have bugs but it means so much to me that BioWare wanted to create the best possible image of their dream for a new generation of players.

When it comes to video game trilogies, there is hardly one that is as iconic and influential as the Mass Effect series. And with the release of the Legendary Edition, newcomers and returning fans can enjoy all three games in higher resolution textures and downloadable contents all in one convenient package. And although the game is mostly fine to enjoy on its own, I'd be remised not to recommend that you play it with mods. Because even though the Legendary Edition is a decent step up visually-wise for the trilogy, it still leaves plenty to be desired concerning everything else. I don't make that statement lightly, and it isn't meant to be inflammatory, it's simply the unfortunate truth. If you want the true Legendary Edition and experience the namesake of the title, and play the game in its best possible state, then the only way to get it is through modding. Fortunately for everyone, myself included, installing mods for Mass Effect Legendary Edition is almost as easy as hating Batarians. As someone who's had experience installing mods for games such as Fallout: New Vegas, Skyrim, and Dragon Age to name a few, Mass Effect has to be the easiest and most painless modding experience I've ever had. 

Thankfully, a fan who goes by the name of SyntheticSyndicate on NexusMods had already done the bulk of the work for us. He created a beginner-friendly modding guide where he'd aggregate the best mods and quality-of-life improvements on the site into a single, mostly, comprehensive collection. It's convenient, easy to understand, and very well organized. Here's the link to his guide for your convenience: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffectlegendaryedition/mods/1127] Modding Guide (and Mod Collection) for Legendary Edition [/url]

As much as I love that guide, there are several other mods I'd like to bring to your attention that wasn't included which I strongly feel should be. This is exactly why I've taken it upon myself to create a companion/supplement guide to the main one for you to use. I've put a lot of work into it, and I hope you find it useful:

Another issue I'd like to address is how players are forced to use EA's terrible proprietary platform, Origins, if they want to play, even if the platform is terribly designed and riddled with bugs. One of which is currently preventing players from earning achievements. It's a problem that has existed ever since the game launched and despite promising to get it fixed, it persists even today. It's a problem that many players had to deal with including me, and it's extremely annoying and inconvenient. Thankfully, there is a clean and easy workaround for this problem. There are many guides detailing the steps, but I found this to be the most reliable and effective. If you're a new player, be sure to follow it before you start playing. It's worked for me many times, and I think it'll work for you too.

With that out of the way, how do I feel about the actual games themselves? All I can say is it's been legendary. I've been a massive fan of the series since 2012 and revisiting it after ten years has been incredibly exciting, emotional, and rewarding. Each game has its many strengths and weaknesses, but the one trait all of them share is unbridled passion and creativity. Each fully deserving of their own review but for the sake of time and real estate, an insightful but quick analysis will have to do. 

[h1] Mass Effect [/h1]

The first Mass Effect used to be the black sheep of the family. It was referred to by many as the gatekeeper of the series and with good reasons. Despite its strong story and characters, the clunky gameplay and rapidly aging graphics were becoming increasingly evident as the generation progresses. However, that's no longer the case with the Legendary Edition. With mods, I had the time of my life with this game. With all of the rough edges polished, the excellent plot, likable characters, and amazing lore were able to shine through like never before seen. To my absolute shock and delight, It went from being my least favorite to my second favorite game in the series, and the only reason it didn't take that top spot is because of the game I'm going to talk about next.  

[h1] Mass Effect 2 [/h1]

Otherwise known as the Crème de la crème of the series, it should come as no surprise to anyone that Mass Effect 2 is my favorite game out of the three, and so often the case with many others, and one only has to play a few hours to begin to understand why so many fans hold it in such high regard. A simple but effective plot gives us a strong goal to work toward, an incredibly memorable and well-written cast of characters, a darker and seedier approach to the tone of the galaxy, the enigmatic and charismatic Illusive Man played flawlessly by Martin Sheen, a more refined and streamlined approach to the gameplay, and what you have in the end is a game that epitomizes everything of what a true sequel should be. Whatever weaknesses it has is profoundly outweighed by the positives, and ten years later I'm thrilled to say that Mass Effect 2 is still one of my favorite games of all time. 

[h1] Mass Effect 3 [/h1]

Where do I begin with this game? On one hand, it has some of the best writing and iconic moments in the entire series. And on the other, some of the most nonsensical, insulting, and downright baffling writing and design choices I've ever seen. One moment you want to sing to the choir about how good the game is, and the next you wonder whether the writing team collectively suffered a massive stroke and were forced to hire chimpanzees to complete the story halfway through. In all seriousness, Mass Effect 3 is the product of a team who worked themselves tirelessly to the brink of physical and mental exhaustion, in states which I can only assume are akin to sweatshop-like conditions, and forced to meet impossible and unrealistic deadlines by Electronic Arts. Not only was Bioware trying to create one of the most ambitious RPGs ever made, but they also had to do it in significantly less time than any of their previous two games, while simultaneously developing a tacked-on multiplayer horde mode. So, as much as I want to scold them for doing such a half-a$$ job with what was supposed to be their magnum opus, I can't help but developed an immense sense of respect and gratitude that the game came out as competently as it did. If you can't tell by now, I'm emotionally torn on this game. [u] I truly do love it [/u] and see the potential in it, but I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment and regret every time I play the game knowing how different and extraordinary it could've been had things turned out differently. If I can leave a piece of advice for anyone going into Mass Effect 3, it's this: Enjoy the game for what it is because there is a lot to love about it. The highs are amazingly high, but prepare yourself for the lows because that sh!t will be lower than the Mariana Trench. 

[h1] Parting Words [/h1]

Despite its shaky and questionable finale, the Mass Effect trilogy had a profound impact on me as it did on so many others. Playing again ten years later, it reminds me why the series was so beloved and had rightly earned such legendary status among fans. Its breathtaking worldbuilding and lore, well-told story, and diverse and well-written ensemble of characters have forever etched themselves into the annals of gaming history. It truly was, and still is, the most epic sci-fi video game saga of all time. And that is why Mass Effect Legendary Edition is my favorite game on the Citadel.

I had heard the ending of ME3 was trash and caused a lot of controversy back in the day. Otherwise, I didn't know much about these games. Not even the genre. No nostalgia blindness here!

Turns out, I missed out on a real gem! This sci-fi epic of galactic proportions was a wonderful experience. 

The story and characters are the primary focus here. The combat is just serviceable in ME1, while ME2 and ME3 feel better. The whole ""your choices matter from game to game"" novelty is pretty nice... even if it usually doesn't have that much tangible impact. It makes the game feel like a cohesive story that you're in control of, I quite liked that. These games reminded me of an old show I used to watch with my father from the 90s called: Farscape. A human running around with all these wacky aliens who're genuinely interesting characters in their own right. It's a nice memory. The galaxy you're introduced to in the first game genuinely feels massive... and that was awesome.

While there's a fresh coat of paint, especially on ME1, that doesn't change how some of the fundamental gameplay mechanics are a bit dated. As stated, combat in ME1 is just serviceable. The Mako in ME1 was cool in concept but the dozens of barren worlds lost their charm quite quickly. ME2's resource management was tedious and you barely even got to use the Hammerhead. ME3's galactic readiness mechanic felt underwhelming and many many more. With that said, these things usually didn't distract too much.

The story left me wanting more. I wanted more interactions with the alien races and the galactic community as a whole rather than JUST the humans. I wanted to explore worlds inhabited by races like the Hanar or the Elcor and see them and their cultures take front and center for a few quests. I wanted some of the morally questionable decisions to have more weight. I wanted to spend more time with characters like Garrus, Joker, and Tali. I wanted the Reapers to be as strange and unknowable as they claimed to be. [b]I just wanted more... and that's a testament to how well the world of Mass Effect sucked me in.[/b]

All the animations look stilted and I wasn't interested in sitting through hours of conversation trees, trying to min/max a ""best"" outcome. The first time I played, I bounced after a couple hours; it felt like a dated game engine.  

While I was waiting for the Starfield release, I decided to give it a go.

Holy cow. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

Once I got off the Citadel and started to explore, the game began to grow on me. By the second game, I found myself doing all the side missions because I didn't want it to end. By the end of the third game...

This is easily the best RPG narrative I have ever played. The magic of this game isn't in the moment-to-moment game play, but in the cumulative effect of getting to know all the characters. Decisions made in ME1 and ME2 carry over and resonate throughout the series.

I was an emotional wreck by the end of the trilogy. I can't think of another video game that has affected me the same way. The Witcher 3 has some wonderful moments, but not to this extent. The writing is fantastic. The voice acting is pitch-perfect throughout the series. I cared about every companion I encountered. Characters I disliked the moment I laid eyes on them grew to become some of my favorites by the end. I felt every loss and every survival. It's remarkable that this level of excellence held up throughout the series.

And if you turn down the sound effects to reduce the sound of the gun, it also reduces a lot of other really important sounds, including dialogue that's not in a proper cutscene, which occurs very often.

1. so many characters to that are so vastly different and learning more about there story was nice

2. I felt often tempted to be devious at times. However, the games throws like 70 thousands options to be ""good"" or ""bad"" and some of the sinister options are actual hilarious.

3. I'm a little sucker for good romance stories in games and they did this flawlessly. you have an important decisions to make in the third game of Mass Effect and the choice you make will be heavily affected by who you decide to romance

4. combat is smooth and gives me that Gears of War vibe which was only of my favourite games growing up so to play something super similar to it felt nostalgic

5. ngl chose to romance the blue alien like come on now

I currently cannot get the game to launch, seemingly because of a broken EA app, that shouldn't be needed to run them game I bought through Steam.

EA app has updated, and now its impossible to launch the game. I've requested supported, trawled forums, reinstalled (multiple times) the EA app (after reboots and various other things), nothing will make the game launch. Its the same effect - click launch in steam, EA app loads (have to log into that), start game - blank window named Link2EA opens then closes itself, nothing happens. I've cycled through this multiple times, spending literally hours trying to get this working from advice.

Its impossible to play this game currently. Its absurd that a game I bought through Steam requires me to launch through (and have an account for and sign into) a different app (EA app), that currently doesn't work. Its the worst kind of cynical business practice. The game technically should run, but rubbish, unnecessary additional apps stop it from working.

Please don't ask me to try anything else, I've spent hours trying and nothing works. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, tried an old version of Origin (won't install), I shouldn't have to waste any more of my time on this just to play a game. It was quicker installing a multi-CD game on Windows 98.

For that reason, I cannot recommend this game. Maybe it works for others, but I'm not the only one suffering this - and its completely unnecessary, caused by an app that shouldn't have anything to do with the game. Games that should be completely offline and bought through Steam require another app (EA app), an EA account and an internet connection to run (but still don't, because its broken). I have requested a refund, although I'm doubtful whether I'll get it. 

Don't really want to waste more time trying to get this game to run, I have precious little gaming time these days its seems as it is.

But yeah, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a great way to play the Mass Effect trilogy nowadays. It takes all the good (and some of the bad) of the original trilogy, made Mass Effect 1 look and play a bit more like 2 & 3 combat-wise, and has all of the DLC (except Pinnacle Station, but who plays Pinnacle Station?) of the trilogy, making it the definitive way to play, in my opinion.

Yes, it doesn't have Mass Effect 3's multiplayer, which, admittedly, was good, but the original ME3 is available as well, so if you want to play that, you can.

As for the EA App... mrehn. That's all I got. Yeah, it's annoying to have extra launchers, regardless of the game, but it's still better than using the Epic Launcher, in my opinion. That's what I think on that subject.

I am not sure how I managed to stay away from spoilers for so many years, but I'm glad I did, as it made the experience even better.  All I knew was that, there was huge controversy with ending and that it was really bad. 
I am glad to report that they made it better and I really liked it. 
Additional DLCs, which are part of this legendary edition are great, add a lot of context and in my opinion should be in mass effect 3 from the start, back when the game was first released. 

Overall, if you like single player games and haven't played this trilogy, this is must have, I bought legendary edition discounted -78% on steam and for that price I don't think you can buy anything better. So much value, great story and awesome companions and relationships. I'd argue this trilogy is worth buying at full price, even today. 

 The only bad thing I can say about this game is EA launcher, which honestly shouldn't exist. 
At the time of writing this, the game is marked on protondb as gold. After setting the proton version to experimental I'd give it gold+, platinum-. Gaming experience on Linux is good. The game runs smooth, without crashing. Mass effect 1 could be more smooth in some places, but overall the games are running great. 

Buy it, play it, it's worth it.

If you have never played the franchise, which you should at least entertain, I suggest either buying this on-sale, dramatically, or waiting for a re-release of Mass Effect (1) alone.

The ME trilogy is one I hold dearly in my heart and definitely deserved a remaster. To have it all packaged into one game is a delight, despite the download size. I’ll be reviewing each game individually with the 1st paragraph focused on positives, and 2nd on negatives.

[b]Mass Effect 1:[/b]

ME1 represents for me a more golden era for Bioware that seems to have disappeared somewhat after Dragon Age: Origins (another masterpiece) when EA gradually reared its ugly marketing head. A time when storyline, moral choices, and RPG progression was something special. ME1 was also unique amidst Bioware titles by actually incorporating more open world exploration elements as opposed to just linear storylines with choices inserted. The game threw you into a unique world with loveable characters, memorable villains, and an epic story. I was 14 when I got into it and can never forget the first time experiencing the terrifying Reaper visions, the goose-bumpy Ilos mission, Vigil’s music… *sniff*, exploring beautiful terrains like Nodacrux and Chasca on the Mako, Sovereign’s and Saren’s badass themes, etc. Of course, there were also unpolished aspects even for its time. Fortunately many have been overhauled in LE. From the moment you launch the new game customisation screen, everything including the character models look more detailed and gorgeous than before. A lot of things have improved from the vanilla version without diminishing the other qualities. 

In terms of negatives, still no ragdoll and omni-gel mechanics not gone. Side-missions still recycle identical environments, but with assets re-arranged. Cutscenes are still unskippable, which can be irritating during replays. Though a minor fault, all choices throughout the story have no impact on the endings (though they carry over, to some degree, in the sequels).

[b][u]Verdict:[/u][/b] ME1 was always strongest in its storyline, atmosphere, world-building, and design ideas (if not execution). With the extra polish, it more than ever holds its place for me as the best of the entire trilogy, and one of my favourite games of all time.

[b]Mass Effect 2:[/b]

ME2’s opening is exciting and hits you in a direction you were not expecting. The storyline – though inferior to ME1 – did a great job of blurring Shepard’s morality by forcing him/her to ally with a normally hostile force. Beloved characters from before like Tali and Garrus are developed further, and new characters like Mordin are absolutely great. The cultures and lore of the alien species is also expanded. Combat is hugely improved and many new biotic abilities are introduced. Normandy ship is more interactable. But the biggest positive with ME2 for me is that, out of the 3 games, it’s the strongest in the choice-matters department. Depending on which squadmate loyalty missions you complete and the responsibilities you assign them with determines whether they live or die. And it’s not just cheap scripted moments with binary choices. It is possible to have EVERYONE survive or NO ONE, depending on how you influence the main storyline. If there is one thing ME2 excels in, it’s definitely replay value.

Despite being heralded as a “darker sequel” I actually didn’t think it was dark enough. Not when you compare to say, KOTOR 2 (a *genuinely* dark sequel that appropriately follows KOTOR 1’s story and premise). Yes there are moments, but the general tone of ME2 borders more often on shootouts and clashes with galactic crime syndicates than Cosmic Horror. It doesn’t develop the Reaper lore, aside from a cheap “twist” near the end. While the Suicide Mission was good, the setting should have been more horrifying given its subject, but the whole level is just too fast-paced and action-oriented to absorb the place you are in. I’ll always find Noveria and Feros creepier than the Collector Base. The soundtrack in ME2 is also mixed, sometimes sounding golden while other times quite generic. Combat gets extremely repetitive, with tedious and constant waves of enemies. Personally, I never liked this action approach as it made ME2 feel more like Gears Of War with dialogue choices rather than an RPG with GOW-style combat. Side quests are less interesting than before; One I recall literally involves nothing more than fighting several Geth up a hill till you reach the top. Compare that to exploring a map and finding a missing survey team underground turned into husks, or a hostage situation with biotics, is that really an improved side mission? Another unfortunate move was the removal of all ME1’s exploration elements. I don’t think people realised that the issues with ME1’s Mako was not the vehicle itself, but the awkwardly hilly terrain you pilot it on. Without that, the Mako was OK to control. Even though the ME2 Hammerhead is more fun, its levels are painfully linear. Unfortunately, ME2 replaces all former exploring with planet resource-scanning that just gets boring after a while.
 
[b][u]Verdict:[/u][/b] When you compare ME1 and ME2 side-by-side, you can tell that Bioware originally had much different ideas. ME2 changes a lot of story and design elements in ways that are hit-and-miss. Thus ME2 always struck me as a superb game by itself, but a disappointment as a sequel to ME1’s story. As the most replayable title of the trilogy however, the crown goes here.

[b]Mass Effect 3:[/b]

ME3 is a product of immensely rushed development (again EA’s ugly head), so in many ways the game is incomplete. On the other hand, it also makes its good elements shine even more brightly as a result. ME3’s intro on Earth is the most intense opening out of the 3 games, and the game’s overall tone is definitely the most depressing. In order to rally support for Earth, Shepard must be forced to make tough decisions that don’t always have a mutually beneficial outcome. You can really feel the stakes here, and many moments between characters might make you shed a tear or two. Combat is yet again improved with better weapons, more open environments allowing tactics and flanking, and long-overdue dive-rolling. The Leviathan DLC mission is very underrated, and should not have been DLC in the first place, as it does exactly what I wanted and give more lore to the Reapers. Though I disliked the retconning of the Prothean physical appearance in ME2, Javik is an awesome DLC character and you won’t be able to resist adding him as a squadmate on every mission just to hear his witty and unique comments.

Again, as a rushed game you can tell a lot was cut and this still applies in the remaster. To quote Zero Punctuation “the endings could have been worse”, but also could have been better. The war asset feature didn’t feel as impactful as ME2’s outcomes, even with the extended endings. The climax was also too brief; it didn’t necessarily need a boss battle, but I was hoping for more to happen than just… what we see after Shepard enters the Citadel beam. ME3 also suffers from the same questionable design decisions found in ME2 such as tedious shootouts with (respawning?) waves of enemies. Also, it’s criminal that Bioware still did not insert that Anderson Convo mod as a core part of the game. Oh well, at least you can still install the mod on LE, just have the tissues ready.

[b][u]Verdict:[/u][/b] ME3 could have been more, but Bioware sure gave it their all given the time constraints. Regardless of what you may think of the game itself, it will always carry the most emotional weight to the journey, as the Threequel of any trilogy should.

So those are the games for you. There’s not much else to say, except that if you were a fan of the trilogy then you must make the purchase. And if you’re new to this, well… you’ll be in for quite a ride!

1328670,145914231,76561198113799498,211,3,6406,0,6252,1694356408,"If there is one game that I genuinely feel deserves the time it takes for me to right down a real review it is 100 percent these games.

All three of these games are full of fantastic character writing that will make you fall in love with each and every one of your companions. The universe is full of interesting lore and beautiful visuals throughout all three of the games. And the game-play connects everything quite well in my opinion. Mass Effect 2 and 3 are perfectly competent cover shooters that while doing nothing groundbreaking are still very enjoyable to play. Mass Effect 1 has a combat and levelling system which while definitely showing its age, has had most of its jagged edges rounded off by the remaster, and is easy enough, even on the hardest difficulty that it won't do much to get in the way of your enjoyment of the story and characters. As a whole the games are better as a whole trilogy than as any individual game, but for me Mass Effect 2 ranges as my number game of all time with Mass Effect 1 and 3 tied for second place.

I am going to have a paragraph talking specifically about Mass Effect 1 because it was the only game of the three that underwent any serious changes. First of all Pinnacle Station one of the two dlcs that were made for Mass Effect 1 has not been brought over to Legendary Edition. I personally am not disappointed by this because it was quite bad. If you happen to want to play it though there is a mod for it on the nexus last time I checked that will at it to the game for you. The hud has undergone changes to make it more inline with how ui design in the later Mass Effect games With the health bars of you and your squadmates being found directly at the bottom of the screen. In terms of gameplay changes it was largely just modernizing the game, adding in mechanics like headshots that were lacking from the original, tightening up combat arenas to prevent you from being able to fall under the map(looking at you Noveria), they also made levelling much more generous allowing you to reach the level-cap feasibly in one playthrough. All of this together does end up serving to make the game easier, but in my opinion it does so by cutting out elements that I would consider tedious and ends up only improving the game.

The final thing I am going to talk about is the graphical updates that the game has undergone for the remaster. Honestly they didn't change that match outside of certain pre-rendered cutscenes where the difference are very noticeable. They added the ability to play the game on higher resolutions, I cannot comment on 4k as my pc is not powerful to play the game on it. Mass Effect 1 looks much better, they brought it inline with the later 2 games in the series graphically, for Mass Effect 2 and 3 I might just be blind, but I personally cannot see that much of the difference between the original and remake. I apologize if I am an idiot, I am. With that being said, that is not a knock against any of the later games in this collection, they are both beautiful and absolutely hold up to a modern standard.

To try and make my ramblings slightly more concise. All three of these games have excellent writing, and characters that anyone could love. Simple but enjoyable gameplay across the board, and looks absolutely beautiful.",1694181597,1694181597,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The story is excellent and well executed, the characters come to feel like old friends, and the gameplay ranges from 'ok' to 'pretty awesome.' But it's the music that, for me, ties it all together into a package that is absorbing, that draws you in emotionally, and that delivers on its promises. I still hear the galaxy map music in times of quiet reflection. The ambient music lends a very unique feel to the games, and I still play the soundtrack for its own sake years later when studying or working. It's not a video game series so much as it is a complete experience, one that is entertaining, at times humorous, bittersweet, and triumphant.

Some characters are more flat than others. Some romances are shallow and unfulfilling. But the characters that are done exceptionally well feel larger than life. Some romances will provoke emotional responses that may surprise you.

There are bits and pieces from each of the three games that I did not especially care for. But they are small and inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. They are more often than not harmless quirks that don't subtract that much from the games. Overall I would say that this series is as close to perfection as you can get to a story driven video game with compelling characters and exciting gameplay. 

Yes, the ending could have been much better. But endings are notoriously difficult to get right, and the fact that we were even treated to a completed trilogy of games that gave us an ending at all is something I am grateful for. I've encountered too many stories in various mediums that never finished what they started, and no ending is a far worse fate than a sub-par ending. And honestly, I think that the games were so well done that it created an extremely high bar to clear. The ending wasn't bad so much as it was apparent from anyone who played the games that it could have been so much more, and that's where a lot of the angst comes from.

My one piece of advice is that if you haven't played this yet, take the time to play it without distractions, with a good pair of headphones, and treat it like an interactive movie. If the first game is too off-putting because of its age, start on 2 (in my opinion the best of the three games overall), and enjoy the ride.

Because you don't own it, you're renting it. EA has this locked up behind a required login. For an offline single player game. 
- do not buy this game to play on your steam deck when offline
- do not buy this game if you hate having to type your complex password every time you want to play for a few minutes. 
- do not buy this game if you believe that EA will, at any moment, decide they're done and turn off the login server, preventing you from ever playing your game again. 
- do not buy this game because EA should be punished for this idiocy

Imagine my frustration, when halfway through an 8 hour airplane ride, I switch back to this (after a quick break to play some Hades) , which I was playing in offline mode just an hour ago, only to find that I must now log in to EA's online server to continue my game in offline mode,  and thus cannot play any more for the entire duration of my flight. 

However if you're okay with all that, and want to support a garbage company with garbage policies designed to illustrate just how much they hate you then go ahead and buy the game. It's really quite good and you'll want to replay it many many times and far into the future to see what happens when you make other choices. It's QUITE good on the Deck if you configure gyro aiming!

It's just too bad you won't be ABLE to play in the future because EA will have turned off the login server. 😎

Boycott mandatory online logins for single player games, it is a stain upon gaming.

UPDATE 2023/05/13:
EA has switched from their old ""origins"" launcher to the new EA launcher, which brings the following new features:
- It is now **COMPLETELY** impossible to launch the game in offline mode, you MUST have an internet connection.
- The launcher no longer recognizes the steam deck ""controller"" and you must use the touch-screen to navigate into the actual game.
- The launcher now takes approximately 72 years to start on the steam deck. Not the game, that loads nice and quick, the *launcher*. To get to the launcher, where you must then *FIND* the game you want to play in the morass of other games EA is hoping you'll buy. Once you have discovered the actual Mass Effect screen you *MIGHT* be able to launch the game, but chances are the ""play game"" button will be offscreen on the deck and the EA launcher provides no way to scroll down to actually press ""play game"". (Edit: In fairness this seems to have been fixed at least.)

Revised opinion: EA is a blight upon humanity. We should build them a throne made of running chainsaws and install them upon it. Steam should actually ban games that do this and go let them rot in obscurity until they learn to play nice.

Also, what a fantastic game, so much fun to play. I can't recommend it highly enough. One of the few games I'll play through multiple times. I wish I didn't have to say that, but it wouldn't be fair not to.

However, it has serious bugs that haven't been fixed after all this time and that should be easy to fix. An NPC simply refusing to appear in the middle of a quest for example thus breaking it.

I don't understand why it is so difficult to fix issues such as the map icon for Emily Wrong being in the wong place. I also don't understand why it's so difficult to change the skip dialogue button so that it doesn't also accidentally skip the conversation choices all the time.

On a lesser note, while the game at least has a sci-fi theme which I tend to prefer and sometimes good writing that redeems it, it also often has some poor sequencing and scripting. You see this from the very beginning where you have to secure a beacon only it's all just a bit too easy.

A more bizarre element is that there is a character that I really hate. She has an ugly stuck up face and when I talked to her on the ship she just went on about incredibly boring stuff like something or rather about beating up boys. Needless to say I almost never have her on my team nor interact.

Suddenly out of nowhere she's a complete...

A spoilt brat as well. Loses composure I guess because she's not the one I'm picking to take out on my team to look at their butt while in the elevator. I'm not sure having such an unlikable character, almost as if on purpose, is really a good idea. The problem in this case is that she suddenly goes nuts and there's little to no build up to it in the game. I don't want an endless romance drama but you would expect just a little build up toward that rather embarrasing display.

There's also this Origin thing... The game basically ships with junkware.

If that's not bad enough, I'm probably about two thirds through. One of the main quests has just broken. It's not a complicated to program one. I just need to kil stuff while stunning some people. I've reached the end of it but while the marker shows on the map, nothing, the quest is dead. Game breaking bug, all though hours played through and the game is ruined, I can't finish it.

I would not recommend buying this. You risk playing it a fair way through only for the game to then be ruined by some bug.

The game is unbearable because it constantly bombs you with dialogue that you can skip through just reading the subtitles then the skip key also slected dialogue options that pop up which ARE absolutely vital. The fact that they haven't fixed the most trivial issue with broken key bindings in all this time even after a remaster shows the pure contempt with which they view the customer.

The surprises never cease to amaze. If you complete the first game in this pack, they try to launch the second, it doesn't launch. The game appears to have so much bloatware that ships with it and unnecessary applications that something as simple as restarting it is a nightmare and may require restarting your computer. Too many moving parts move of which are unnecessary.

The first game has a bug where if you zoom into planets you get stuck and can't zoom out. This isn't fixed by the second game showing a very poor commitment to player experience. I can't believe these bugs are hard to detect or fix especially by the time of a remaster.

ME3 appears to censor swearing which ruins the realism of the game. While ME2 does improve a few things, the game still has a habit of taking away good things or generally being confusing and obnoxious. ME3 appears to have brought in formulaic game design. People don't always want replayability for a game like this. Don't force it with new game plus requiring a play through in the first place and enable a mode in game play to make it very easy to spot things to interact with rather than having to run around excessively to avoid missing things. Don't try to force the player into another playthrough when they don't want that. Replayability is always secondary for this kind of game. It's not like chess or an RTS. Don't try to make things necessary that should not be.

Don't hire more than one or two people with just game design degrees and don't put people like that in charge. You need people with natural game design talent to lead the charge. People who know things like don't snatch the controller away from the player. You can't even pause cut scenes by the time of ME3. People who genuinely understand the appropriate boundaries between player and game maker, that is, when to let the player play and to let the creator create.

What the hell is the idea of a fullscreen launcher? Is it to hide the spyware origin window? When something goes wrong such as the game freezing on startup this is very annoying.

Since legendary eddition includes MA, MA2, MA3 will write comments for all 3. 

Mass Effect 1: 
Story was somewhat OK, but i was unable to compelate the game cause there is UI issues. 
Litarly for every quest to compelate it, i need to check how and what i need to do online. The jurnal info do not include information or suggestion where to look. So always it is check the web, check the web, check the web and nothig else. 
Combat was ... i do not know but it realy did not feel ok or fun in fights... 

Mass Effect 2:
THE WORST RPG EVER! Bioware prides itself as story driven RPG experts. I have never felt as railroaded as i feel in this game. Yes i have some option what to click in cornversation or where to go, but in the end i am forced to do stuff i might not like. 
Basicaly if you want to see how it woudl feel to be slave, how it feels to be hope-less, this game is for you!

///// spoiler section/////
Game begins with Evil corp bringing me back from dead and askign me to deal with the new threat. YUes sure, i would love that. But i am forced to cooperate with the evil corp (no option to look for ship and crew elsewhere). 
They are open about adding many spies on the ship and crew that i am given. All my friends from 1st game are now either my enemies or Evil corp has bought their loyalty. 
And all game long i have feelign that my character will be shot in back because of my 2nd in command. And i have no otion to get rid of her at all... Litarly none.
/////// spoiler end ///////

///// spoiler section 2/////
well that dread that Evil Corp will betray me, it never happened so that is a good note. But CEO of Evil Corp will say i betrayed him... 
/////// spoiler end ///////

Combat seems reasonablyt fun, although i never find myself using allied abilities. Probably shoudl have used class of bionics instead of stealth character, cause some of those abilities sound fun...

Mass Effect 3: 
Combat system seems reasonably good. Skills are usefull even when you focus primery on weapon damage. 
Although i had hoped for better weapon options in this game. I am infiltrator and i use sniper as my main weapon, but automatic and semi automatic snipers soon out of character, and regular snipers are so heavy taht it ruins ability CD. (yes, i use them often)
Even many pistols make make higher damage then most powerfull assault rifle, which seems odd. 

Story seems ok, although it lacks option to set focus. From early start and previous game it is clear that main villan is not the Reapers that kill people few millions a day on  a slow day, but Evil Corp. And yet, i can not set largest spy network on mission to find it  and its CEO. Can not send a new message in news to people give all info on Evil Corp (only 1 input at very early game). 
But tension and feelign the story generates is good. Yuo can realy feel the tension from story. 
Although as all these story missions, Why i am over audio said i need to hurry and run forward but game mechanics as kthat i check all corners for new weapon or upgrade? The story shoudl be alligned with mission - if i am urged forward do not add new items in corners of map. I am well funder operative in mission. Can make it that gainign new weapons is part of story not secondary game in addition to main one...
Also there are multiple instances where you need to kill a boss fight, but then it cuts to cinematic and turns out that there was no reason to shoot at all... a bit pointless.
Lastly how many times did we have cinematic where bad guys do something, If only i could take my rifle and shoot them. But no, cinematic keeps on going and going and going... only to end 1minute later when situation is worse... That is bad design...

N7 missions could be better. They are way too short. 
You just began warming up and then it is over... i want to shoot more, especially if story suggest that...

Citadel DLC is crap - do not play it.

If you can get pass the issues you might have with EA's launcher (in my case my steam account was linked to an old automated account created when I played an EA game many many years ago) and I had to talk to support to get this fixed. I write this here so if someone has a similar issue where the game won't start and you get the ""something went wrong"" error, it could be that.

The graphics are more or less the same throughout each game, the improvements when compared to original footage are huge, but obviously the further you are into the games the better looking they become, and the gameplay improves too.

The story is probably the strongest aspect of the game, and although I am aware a lot of people are unsatisfied with the ending of the third game, I actually enjoyed one of the endings. There are definitely a lot of plot holes near the end, but you can clearly see the team was strained when they did the game, and even if this is a remaster, I feel it better to preserve the original game with all its design issues intact, so that new players like me can really feel what it was like playing it at the time.

Each game is a third-person shooter with an emphasis role-play.

The first ME feels the most raw and RPG-like of the series. 
The gameplay is somwhat clunky and you may get overwhelmed by a lot of information, the massive skill trees and the confusing amount of weapons, gadgets and armor.
But in total, it feels like a true passion project, with a great story and a memorable soundtrack.

ME2 is arguably the best entry in the series, 
finding a great balance between the shooter and RPG aspects.
A good story with a stressful and dignified finale.
Smoother gameplay and crew members with more depth.
And overall a more polished feeling, with side missions feeling less like a check list and more meaningful.
To my personal dismay, the weapons and armor arsenal has been greatly reduced after feedback from the first game. 
An example being grenades and weapon mods becoming part of already shortened skill trees.

Starting with Arrival (ME2's last DLC), the feeling of the series changes drastically.
It felt like ME3 puts more emphasis on the shooter than the role-play part.
Depite some shining moments and the gameplay being possibly the best it has every been.
I feel that ME3 relies on already established plots and characters a little too much.

Then ME3 came out, I played it once, and didn’t touch the series again for over ten years. So coming back to it.

Mass Effect is still a really fun game. It has very awkward combat, some pretty cringe dialog, and I think probably hands down the worst selection of side quests of any rpg I’ve ever played. But the story is strong, the characters are mostly very engaging, and it creates one of the most interesting sci fi worlds I’ve seen as well as one that is surprisingly well presented in terms of its themes and details.

Mass Effect 2 is one of the best video games ever made. Other than a few minor flaws it’s an almost perfect game. Even all these years later, and having played a lot of other great games, I really have nothing bad to say about it. I’ve still never really seen anything out perform it in terms of storytelling, character development, and feeling like you’re really in a story that follows and adapts to your choices.

Mass Effect 3 is a tedious slog that is honestly kind of baffling at times. It’s baffling how slow and disorganized it feels, baffling how repetitive and boring the missions are, baffling how awkwardly it deals with a lot of the story beats that it, itself, set up in the first game, yet seems totally unable to manage now. I can only assume the fact that the lead writer had left the series and EA had taken over management is the reason it feels so rushed and directionless. And the DLC, which I had never played back in the day, is also pretty bad. I seriously struggled to even get through it. Replaying the first two games made me want to play through them again and again. Playing the third one made me want to stop playing the series altogether. I especially like that every mission ends by putting you into a useless room that you have to immediately leave through a loading screen to get back to the only part of the ship you would ever logically want to be in when a mission ends. So glad the remaster didn’t fix that, it’s super fun walking through that load screen four hundred times, 10/10 guys.

Overall I still think it’s one of the best game franchises out there, and even the botched third entry isn’t entirely worthless. There are some decent parts hidden in there. I do think it’s worth playing, particularly since ME2 is about as good as video games get. But it’s a shame that the finale dropped so many of the balls the series had been juggling up until then.",1693114492,1693114492,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly though so far I have had to lower the difficulty in ME2 from hard to med (was fine in ME1) but due to multiple enemies shooting right through the walls they are standing on the other side of, one shot aimbot rocket launcher dudes everywhere and my AI team members turning around mid fight to stop shooting and just look at a wall and die, which the enemy AI did too, to be fair. With that said I like this series so far but I just had to give my two cents on what I have experienced up to this point, a nearly perfect space game trilogy that lacks polish/Q@A bug fixing and considering this is a EA published game I'm really not all that surprised. UPDATE Just ran into the Hammerhead sound bug when picking up resources with the Hammerhead that made me rip my headphones out of my ears it was so loud,  something I have only had to do in some early access games (I'm looking at you 7DTD/Ark SE) but never to this extent, this bug is LOUD, repetitive and sounds like a geiger counter mixed with a broken item scanner at Wall-Mart set to 1000% volume blasting directly into your ear drums and the fix is a mod that only works if you restart your campaign and I didn't start the Hammerhead missions till about 6-7 hours in or mute the game while playing missions that involve it because that's fun.. I honestly don't know what to say, up to this point has been great but the quality of this remaster has just nose dived and after checking online forums it looks like every issue I have had and the multiple ones I haven't listed just go unfixed for years with no sign of any one giving a 5hit or devs even commenting/addressing them.",1693080897,1693080897,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Mass Effect: Legendary Edition [/h1]

This Trilogy Collection caught my eye when it was announced on Steam, as someone who never played any of the Mass Effects in the PS3/360 era. It's got action, drama, daring rescues and romance in a space-faring universe that more games should bring back in the future. 

Commander Shepard is completely customizable and can be transferred between games. Each entry remembers every choice and event from the last without any trouble, and its easy to bounce between games. The characters in every game are all memorable and also transfer between games while taking note past events and decisions. Plenty of human companions to relate to with Ashley, Kaiden, Jacob, Miranda, Jack etc. and their alien counterparts are just as good if not even better with Garrus, Tali, Wrex, Liara, Grunt etc. 

Unfortunately, the gameplay itself did not age well, but that's just what to expect from games made in 2007/09/12. It's clunky as all hell. Luckily, the story and choice mechanics outside fighting and walking/running more than make up for it. 

[spoiler] I romanticized Ashley Williams and the things I did to her are only half the things I'd do to her in real life... [/spoiler]

[b] [u] Mass Effect [/u] [/b]

Not too long, but has so much repeatability that you won't care (I sure didn't). You start off customizing and creating your character, and even if they have a predetermined last name you can still basically make them whoever. 
Since it's the first of the trilogy, they do a fantastic job at world building. Exploring really feels like a luxury and every world feels different in it's own way. Different people to explore, and aesthetically pleasing to be around. 
Gameplay wise, it has its own mechanics. Naturally it is the one to introduce us to useful squadmates, tools and abilites, character classes and combat. It's also the only one of the three (as far as I remember) to use vehicles in missions, called the Mako. Since's it's the oldest, this really feels the clunkiest so set your expectations on other elements. 
The Choice System is what grabbed me to commit to the rest of the trilogy and not stop after finishing the first. Choices aren't always black and white, but how you approach them is what actually matters. Renegade Choices give you extra dialogue that actually effect the plot and sets the dominoes for the next two games, which you earn with points that add up.
Definitely one of the best games of all time out there in terms of first impressions and being the first in a series.

The best one in the collection, it's a lot more action-packed than it is an RPG and it's a big change, one I would happily take. They've changed a lot of the weapons, which are more like natural guns used by the military and less like alien ray guns and laser beams used in sci-fi elements. 
Unfortunately, not as much exploration, but they make up for it with the way you are supposed to recruit and build your team. The missions you take to recruit them are great, but they add an extra incentive through loyalty. Do it right, and you can earn the trust and loyalty of your crew. It was probably my favorite part of the whole game, the whole experience.
You are revived and work for one of the other factions in Cerberus, in a nice change of pace. A very intriguing story with a big hook that has probably caused me the most depression in the whole series with the dark direction they took. So many people died in my first playthrough that I wish I had made sure to do the missions properly and plan ahead first.
Overall definitely the best in this trilogy and I'm probably gonna replay it the most.

Holds it's own weight to finish the series strong ( MOSTLY, [spoiler] outside of it's extremely controversial ending, who thought it was a good idea to turn your character stupid in the last few minutes of the game? Thankfully it's not bad enough to ruin the game for me. [/spoiler] ). 
The gameplay probably peaked here in my opinion, although I don't understand why in 2012 we still have the 'jump' button for sprint while being unable to change your camera angle at the same time, and why we can't jump but have to rely on parkour through arrows. I could accept it in 07 and 09 but by 12 this just gets old.
The characters peaked here in my opinion, even though we don't get the same full roster as ME2. The relationship building and character development really showed off, and the game has you starting off from Earth, instead of building your team like you did in the second game, this time you are recruiting the support and resources of entire alien races to fight a war against overwhelmingly unfavorable odds. It's a clever change of pace that I almost like as much. 
While not as good as the second, I largely prefer it to the first and that's no slouch to it either as it was a fantastic first game.

While many games out there promote free choice and decisions, only a very few select amount of games actually feel like they matter to the point of having multiple different storylines and unpredictable events. It's in the Elite Club of decision based games, matched only by Detroit: BH and Telltale (and exceed most their games if not them all). Outdated and primitive gameplay design aside, it has tons of replayability. If you haven't played the games before like me, or are a returning player that hasn't played in years, pick it up and it will consume your time and blow you away.

Thanks to the incredible scope of the scenario, you will get to know the fictional universe and its inhabitants in unprecedented depth.

I will try to describe the core and atmosphere of the series without major spoilers.
As the commander of a unique spaceship and special strike force, you travel the galaxy to intervene where needed and make many difficult choices that you then have to live with. While you get to know the individual alien races and assemble your party, a very successfully dosed central plot slowly begins to develop in the background, revolving around the suspiciously similar mythology of many space civilizations - ancient records tell of a divine race of thinking machines that return in cycles to ""harvest"" organic life.

One of the main charms of Mass Effect lies in the gradual and slow unraveling of the complex relationships between the many cosmic races, blindly chasing the main goal while trying to tick off another completed game is completely counterproductive.

It is fascinating to observe from a distance how well all three parts of the game work even after all these years and fit perfectly into the mosaic of a single, perfectly connected story. It is in this interconnectedness that the great strength of the Legendary Edition as a package lies, as it offers an easy way to enjoy all the content of the main games as well as their often excellent or even absolutely essential DLC additions, which have been organically integrated directly into the main games for this edition. And although a great progress can be felt between the individual parts not only in terms of the setting or gameplay, but also in terms of storytelling, a certain naivety and old worldliness of the first part is suitably contrasted with the captivating personal level of the second part, so that everything culminates in an absolute war epic in the final three.

When delving into the franchise's origin with ME1, I found it to be a solid starting point for the series. While the remaster didn't address this, I wish they had integrated ME3's enhanced sprinting, dodging, and melee mechanics into this installment. Improved sprinting alone would've been a welcome addition, as Shepard seemed to exhaust quickly during runs. The handling of the Mako vehicle could be quite frustrating, particularly when navigating tricky terrains during side missions. Setting this aside, the game was enjoyable.

7/10

ME2 encountered some similar issues to its predecessor, ME1, but showed improvement in several aspects. Sprinting continued to feel lackluster. The Hammerhead vehicle brought better control than the Mako, yet its missions didn't quite capture a sense of fun. The hacking and bypassing mechanics experienced a regression from ME1, losing the simplicity that made them engaging. This game's resource-scanning mechanics were also tedious, despite the upgrade available. The upgrade system, however, was commendable, and the DLC content added value. Other than that, this game is a must play.

8/10

THEY FINALLY IMPROVED SPRINTING.

ME3 is my personal favourite (ending aside) among the 3 because it's gameplay is miles better among the first two, with improvements to melee and dodging. No more stupid vehicles to control, and no more hacking as well, which is better than ME2. Probe launching still exists, but kept to a minimum which is nice. They took all the bad things from the previous 2 and simply improved it or got rid of it. The game effectively conveyed the high stakes of the reaper invasion and the sacrifices required for victory, but the introduction of Kai Leng felt unnecessary and left me questioning its purpose. The ending felt underwhelming and didn't entirely honor the weight of the choices I made. This game has the best DLC in my opinion.

It's crazy how years later this series can still have such a hold over me. If you haven't played it, play it.

While Mass Effect 1 set the mood and established a very compelling story, my only real critique of it is that it feels very PSP-corridor-style when it came to roaming around in the rover. Just coming out of a FF7 Crisis Core playthrough, it felt very much like that. Mass Effect really spiced things up a bit. Story line was excellent, flipping the narrative of Cerebrus from semi-antagonist in the first game to real up and center in this one was narrative genius. Compound this into Mass Effect 3 when ish really hits the fan with TIM and just excellent, fun, engaging combat and honestly I just really loved and looked forward to playing this game. Without spoiling too much, I do like the ending of this game. The premise of the series is that your choices have consequences and this does a good job at bringing it full circle with your choice at the end.

Mass Effect 1: My favorite of the series, fun gun play, fun companions, i enjoyed the weapon system the most in this game. The story is pretty solid, and is the one i look most forward toward replaying. the side quests do get very same-y after a while

Mass Effect 2: Kinda mid. A larger cast of companions, which is really nice and enjoyable, but the switch to limited ammo and a borderline nonsensical story makes it pretty meh. Not meh enough to never play again, but not hella excited for it

Mass Effect 3: So. Smaller cast, meh. Encumbrance system, sucky. Removal of ME2 companion loyalty quests, sadge. Continuation of the ME2 gun play system, annoying. The over all plot is way better than Mass Effect 2, but the ending i found to be pretty bad, personally.

Over all I did enjoy my time playing through the series, and im glad I did finally play it, but there are just a few issues I have that bug me, mainly the ending to Mass Effect 3. I would say it is worth it to buy for Mass Effect 1 and the companion quests and interactions in Mass Effect 2, and then you might as well just finish Mass Effect 3 just to wrap up the story, ya know? If you prefer RPG elements, you'll love Mass Effect 1, if yu prefer linear shooter elements, you'll love Mass Effect 3... just wish the NPCs weren't so racist towards each other...",1691373206,1692517085,True,0,0,0.52017974853515625,0,True,False,False

However, I didn't install it through the EA app nor would it let me interact with the game in my EA app in any capacity.

technically it's a hot mess. there are 100 polygons on the screen and the game randomly drops to 20 fps from a solid 60. The ""legendary"" added a graphical overlay that persists when you alt tab to your desktop.

And then we have to get to the games. All of them are dated and don't feel up to todays standards. The story is on the rails only pretending to give you options. The story is not very well written.
Honestly I never got the hype back then for these games and after revisiting them remastered I get the hype even less so.
In ME3 your companions are corn actors and the whole screen is full of overlays prompting you to press V to look at the scenery or Space to run. There is zero immersion to be had.
If telling and npc off is all that you need in a game this is for you. If you need character development and a decent shooter or story game - this is not for you.
Oh yeah the combat, haven't even mentioned that. The combat is so janky. Just everything is so dumb with combat. the comtrols. the ai, enemies hiding constantly or running up to you and meleeing you then running away again.

First and foremost, no, this is absolutely not worth full price lmfao - video games in general stopped being worth $60 when we stopped printing them on discs and selling them at GameStop, those days are LONG gone and you shouldn't be buying shit for $60 imo

That said, it's Mass Effect. Moreover, it's the entire Mass Effect series (save Andromeda) in one bundle. That's gonna be a good deal no matter how you slice it.

SECTION 1: THE BUNDLE
========================
Upon buying this bundle, two problems immediately rear their heads. Both are relatively minor, but annoyances nonetheless, and I can totally see them turning people who've never played ME away. The first of these being the size of this bundle. Going in, I expected this to work like how most bundles do on PlayStation, where the bundle itself is simply a platform for the games and each one can be installed and uninstalled as needed (See: The Handsome Collection). This is not the case. This is a launcher, yes, but all three Mass Effect games are baked right in, meaning a very long install time (I'd recommend letting it install before work or before bed) and the need to carve out a full 110 GB for this game to install correctly. The other, more cumbersome, issue is the game's forcing of EA Play upon you. Surprisingly, EA Play actually isn't that intrusive, aside from opening on startup in much the same way Steam does, and the ""Remember Me"" box tending to just... not work, but it doesn't interrupt gameplay, urge you to buy anything or try to entice you with any kind of stupid exclusive content (Like how FC4 has exclusive uPlay weapons), and - I never thought I'd be saying this, but - hats off to EA on this one, it seems like they really did try their hardest to integrate the Steam version of this game more with Steam than with their own service, and that takes standards I honestly did not expect from them going in. The game installs fine and doesn't need any fan fixes or patches.

SECTION 2: ME1
========================
Mass Effect 1 is nothing short of a masterpiece. On top of laying the foundation for the series, it looks great in the Legendary remaster, and, from what I hear, I'm in the minority on this one, but I firmly believe it has the best gameplay of the three. It's a surprisingly good introduction to more old-school RPG type games, with a character sheet that offers depth, while also being streamlined enough that people who might not know how to build a character in a more proper RPG with a billion different stats and all those fancy numbers (See: Wizardry 8) will be able to pick up on it relatively quickly. The story, of course, is simple, but very fun and full of depth. I found this game the most fun when I went out of my way to try to pick up side quests, often finding even boring-sounding ones to carry more depth than they initially seemed to, in a very similar way to SWTOR's side quests. Again, I realize I'm in the minority on this one, but ME1 remains my favorite of the three.

SECTION 3: ME2
========================
A good game, with a lot of improvement over ME1, but also, a lot of questionable changes. It was a product of its time, I suppose, and is in no way a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the switch from overheating to more traditional ammo management, nor the switch from on-demand medkits to cover shooting and regenerating health, the further streamlining of skill strees, almost to the point of oversimplification, the lack of choice regarding [spoiler]helping Cerberus, a supposed racist terrorist group[/spoiler] (although I realize you can play Shep as not liking them, you still have to play along regardless) and I just really really don't like Miranda in particular. It's pretty clear why she's there, and while she does have a pretty good amount of depth, I personally think the devs were trying way too hard to make her into this super badass mysterious sexy lady, and it ended up falling flat for me, but I realize that's personal. Also the fact that [spoiler]Miranda of all characters gets a romance path and Kasumi gets literally no dialogue after her companion mission[/spoiler] is an absolute travesty. ME2 also suffers, in my humble opinion, from a lacking Paragon/Renegade system in comparison to ME1, I feel like Para/Ren grow WAY too slowly if you don't deliberately build Shep around being purely one or another, I did a decent amount of side questing, and answered things exactly as I would irl, and finished the game with somewhere around 2 and a half bars in Para, and 1 and 1 quarter bars in Ren, and while it was never a super big issue, it locked me out of dialogue at a few small moments [spoiler]such as trying to resist Samara's daughter[/spoiler] which left me with this, like, slightly dejected kind of feeling, like ""Aww, but that would've been so cool!""
My final, and probably biggest complaint about ME2 is going to have to be the ending. Nothing with the story itself, the story is fine, but the scene really rubbed me the wrong way. On my first playthrough, I kind of neglected upgrading the ship. Normally, when games do the whole ""Upgrade the ship/base/whatever"" thing, it's either cosmetic or some kind of stat boost. This is not the case here. Refusing to upgrade the ship enough will literally result in [spoiler]multiple companion characters unceremoniously dying without so much as dialogue in the final cutscene.[/spoiler] I get it, it's my fault, but the way it was handled felt almost passive-aggressive, as it was purely the consequence of me not engaging with a part of the game I simply wasn't interested in. I'm not going to go and say that it's necessarily bad design, but I would've appreciated more of a heads-up if it was going to be that important. Overall, ME2 has some really frustrating, and honestly, confusing decisions compared to ME1, but I really, really enjoyed it. Loved almost all the companions, as well - The only one I even remotely disliked was Miranda, and while a few (See: Zaeed, Kasumi) felt a little undercooked, I found myself loving both the new and returning characters, with Thane, Mordin, and Grunt in particular standing out as stellar characters to me.

SECTION 4: ME3
========================
So, Mass Effect 3 is more aptly called Mass Effect 2.5.
I love Mass Effect, but I'd be lying if I said ME3 wasn't a disappointment, in my eyes.
A lot of what's wrong with ME3 is that it doubled down on some of the worst aspects of 2 - and I loved 2, for the most part, but ME3 really killed it for me, between the slow-ass, janky dodge-rolls, the scripted """"""jump"""""" mechanic, the even further emphasis placed on cover, and the comparative lack of freedom, especially compared to the first game, ME3 more than dropped the ball by trying to be this weird mix of Uncharted, Gears of War, Call of Duty, and every other game that comes to mind when I say ""2010s third-person shooter"" instead of just being Mass Effect. Right off the bat, scripted sequences are obvious, cutscenes take way too long, dialogue is cheesy, and while Shep has always been a little autistic, it feels like they really hammed it up this time, to the point of making fun of it in one of the DLCs. I'm really not a huge fan of Mass Effect going from a tactical squad-command shooter with cover mechanics in the first game, to a cover shooter with squad-command aspects in the second game, to a full-on cover shooter in this one, but with the success of ME2, it was practically guaranteed that ME3 would follow up on it. Grenades are back, at least, but work more like traditional grenades than the ones we had in 1, which were almost like TF2's stickybombs, and I feel like that's a step backwards - I liked having these weird, oddball grenades that you had to use deliberately. Text limit reached, but I could go on. ME3 is bad, sorry.",1691677712,1691969189,True,2,0,0.51930081844329834,1,True,False,False

There is one issue though, the achievement system is very bugged due to the EA app. You try to unlock achievements and no success, that is until you see the in-game list which indicate that you did unlock them, but in the EA app and Steam they remain unlocked. It's like the system relies on some kind of pop-up function (from the achievements popping up in screen) and if there is some kind of disconnection or bug that prevents the EA app from detecting that pop-up, the achievements never get unlocked.
There is a lot of solutions that involved installing the original Origin app which is no longer available as it was replaced some months ago with EA app, which is infested with bugs. I've seen posts from 2 years ago mentioning this issues, fast forwarding to 08/10/2023 and nothing has been done to solve it. EA doesn't care, so if your play-through involves achievements it will be a headache which the only way to do them will be with 3rd party editors to unlock them in Steam, but in the EA app they will forever remain in oblivion.",1690337252,1691665104,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The party members make you so invested and Id say you were heartless to not be an anxious mess at the start of 2s finale.

I wish I could play this on my Steam Deck without having to worry about being connected to servers on Launch. Guess its just standard practice for big publishers and I try to be understanding most cases. In my opinion in this case though- just a tad unnecessary level of DRM for single player story RPGs. Like include the DRM if you really have to so you can pay the devs and all; but very anti consumer and feels like I have a suit breathing down my neck while I play saying ""DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT STEALING THIS BUCKO. IM WATCHING YOU."" - after i already gave them my money and bought it. Definitely hampers how much i enjoy the game starting out, cuz it just makes it stressful. I just wanted to have chill space times with Rex and Tali :( not have my play sessions babysat by a lawyer. 

Maybe there is some option to disable hidden in the app or whatever- and if so I will edit this or just write a new review reflecting that, but right now just dont have as much desire to keep it installed on my Steam Deck considering I take it to play when im out of the house. 
Not refunding because I love these games and a longtime fan of BioWare. But please maybe find some compromise for DRM that doesnt need me to be chaperoned every launch.",1691627573,1691628062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(???????) / Map shortcut key is an object indicator , you need to go in to the whole index through the escape button which *parum pum tsss* you can not keybind / While sticking to a wall, several times I was not able to aim / You have to search for ammo versus energy weapons in ME1, which was such a good solution and improved the immersion/ AI companions are STUPID / Hacking can be very frustrated. / At certain points in the main story I was forced to do a main quest while I wanted to do some side quests.

I just finished ME1 and I am hooked. What a fantastic RPG. I cannot wait to jump back into ME2 and play ME3 for the first time.

The lore is deep, the plot is gripping, the characters are interesting. The combat is good enough. The itemization in ME1 sucks, but you can mostly ignore it.

I knew I was all-in when I found myself absorbed in the chief engineer describing how the stealth system works on the Normandy. A completely optional conversation, yet I was mesmerized and I explored every line of dialogue available because it was so interesting and well written.

Highly recommended!


Update: ME2 Review

Now I understand why I can't recall much of ME2 from back when I played it on release: The game is mostly forgettable. Combat mechanics are improved, but most encounters are corridor shooters with very little tactical options or challenge. The plot goes nowhere. I didn't enjoy the squadmate quests either. Doesn't hold a candle to the incredible ME1.


Update: ME3 Review

Imagine ME2, but with fewer squadmates, improved combat mechanics, more cinematic moments, and a more compelling story. Unfortunately the combat encounters suffer from the same issues as ME2.

This is not a review of the story and I'm sure I will end up playing through this again as Mass Effect has a way of always drawing me back. 

The good: So much love has been put into this remaster, ESPECIALLY the original Mass Effect - and wow is ME1 a joy to play again. It still has some dated aspects but it is not difficult to get through at all and the Legendary Edition really lets you forget about all the wonkyness of the original to just get back into that story and enjoy the first ride around the galaxy.
Everything is beautiful and specifically when you are playing the game it runs amazingly. 

That last point leads me directly to the bad though. Actually getting this game to start is sometimes like pulling teeth with the EA launcher. Seriously, trust all the negative reviews citing that specifically. Yes, there are some with workarounds, but that is also a huge pain and really not accessible for folks who are not technologically inclined. Also, yes specifically the game runs well but if you have any peripherals plugged in (you know... a microphone, a midi keyboard.... a CONTROLLER?) there's a nonzero chance you'll encounter extreme stuttering and slugging playback of the pre-rendered cutscenes. I'm talking 7-14fps. It makes no sense. 

I got this for $15, and as of writing this review it is on sale for that price. Absolutely I would recommend it at that price point, for if you have or have not played before. It is such a wonderful series and despite all the issues I had a fantastic time once again. However at the normal $60?

Each review for each game will be written directly after I finished them. This will update with every game completed, likely taking around 100 hours. I will also conclude with my overall legendary experience at the end.

Mass Effect 1 - Completionist - 35.6 Hours - 8/10
The first entry into the series is a masterpiece, I do, however, have some qualms with the monotonus grinding for 100%. Some people will say ""they cannot make everything unique"" and that i shouldn't complain because ""i chose completion"", well i disagree - going around and clicking on planets or finding the same resources on planets isn't fun. 

The game was relatively smooth running, aside from the odd bug here or there: Like the camera glitching out or the mako glitching out and becoming stuck. Aside from these two aspects I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The story was 10/10, dialogue and voice acting was great, and the combat had its unique quirks and perks to it. If the aforementioned issues wasn't there this game would easily be a 10/10.

On to the next Instalment! 

TLDR: BUY IT! OR AT LEAST TRY IT ON EA PLAY FOR £3 FIRST. A GREAT SERIES OF GAMES. I decided to buy legendary edition just based on the first game.

PSA: Completionist is everything is done in the game, I do not give a damn if I miss a few achievements tied to odd abilities that I will have to replay the game for!",1691122964,1691122964,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★★

Mass Effect Legendary Edition is, without a doubt, the quintessential way to experience one of the most groundbreaking trilogies in gaming history. As someone who has devoted an immense portion of my gaming life to these extraordinary titles - from the nostalgic era of the Xbox 360 and PS3 to the present day - I am pleased to say that the remastering is nothing short of phenomenal.

The love and care poured into the Legendary Edition are apparent from the moment you launch the game. The graphical improvements breathe new life into familiar worlds and characters, adding a fresh coat of polish to visuals that I have admired for years. It's the same beloved universe, now presented with the vibrancy and detail that modern hardware allows. Yet, this edition maintains the essence and soul of the original games, making the experience feel nostalgically familiar yet beautifully enhanced.

The narrative aspect of the Mass Effect series is, as ever, unparalleled. Deep and intricate plots keep you engrossed, pushing you to dig deeper, to learn more, to engage further with the myriad characters who populate these worlds. Speaking of characters, Mass Effect’s roster is one of the most memorable in gaming history, and the Legendary Edition does them justice. Their individual stories, hopes, fears, and quirks are as compelling as ever, drawing you back into the personal dramas and epic galactic struggles that have defined the Mass Effect experience.

The lore in Mass Effect is deep and expansive, creating a living, breathing universe that is easy to lose yourself in. Whether you are a series veteran like me or a newcomer to this iconic series, there is always something new to discover, a piece of lore or a hidden backstory that adds depth to the overall narrative tapestry.

One of the key highlights of this edition is the ability to journey through the entirety of the saga in a seamless and interconnected manner. The narrative threads of all three games are beautifully woven together, forming a single, coherent epic that can be experienced without interruption. It provides the ideal opportunity to undertake a comprehensive expedition through the narrative - from the intense beginnings in the first installment to the deeply poignant and widely discussed conclusion of the third game.

In conclusion, the Mass Effect Legendary Edition is more than just a remaster. It's a love letter to the fans, an acknowledgment of the countless hours we have poured into this universe, the connections we have made, and the memories we have created. For those who, like me, consider these games an integral part of their gaming journey, the Legendary Edition offers the opportunity to revisit cherished moments with a new sense of awe and appreciation. And for newcomers, it’s an open invitation to lose themselves in one of the most immersive, well-crafted, and unforgettable sagas in gaming history. Mass Effect Legendary Edition is, in my book, a masterpiece that transcends time and technological advancement.

I bought this and thought maybe youth had clouded my judgement.  I can confidently say that after having played the trilogy again, Mass Effect remains the best video game series to me. 

I love Commander Shepherd and how Bioware makes it feel like its YOUR Shepard even though there's only so much variation between yours and mine.  I love the companions and how memorable they are even after all these years.  I love the world building and exploration.  I love the music and visual design choices.

I was first introduced to the series through Mass Effect 2. Although I was unable to understand the story properly (since I didn't play Mass Effect 1 before) but I was hooked because of the characters, the world, the missions, etc. It felt so lively, while playing as Shepard for the first time, I really felt as if I am part of that fictional world and teammates or your love interest never felt so genuine in any other game.

Mass Effect 1: I had played this game after playing Mass Effect 2 and didn't really liked the gameplay and tons of bugs. But despite everything the characters, story, dialogues, music, world building was top notch.

Mass Effect 2: It's the first game I had played in the trilogy and till date it is still the best out of the three IMO. The friendship my character had developed with others was really remarkable. Also the love interest I had formed in ME2 felt so genuine. It felt as if the digital fictional woman really cared for my character.

Mass Effect 3: The finale of the series. Gameplay wise this one is the best out of the three, storywise it is also great but the ending, which could've been a lot better than Bioware delivered. Be mindful the ending is not bad, it's just should have been much more and felt rushed.

At the end of the trilogy you will really feel something for your character, your friends and your love interest. This trilogy was something exceptional which I doubt any game could ever beat. And the legendary edition packs all the three games together with improved visuals, bug fixing and all 40 DLCs. Mass Effect 1 is the one most improved and the three games, gameplay is improved a lot along with visuals and other miscellaneous improvements.

The biggest issue with this game is the EA launcher..... it is really awful... wish I could get rid of it. And to launch the game you have to be online.",1624635745,1690904353,True,0,0,0.492154598236083984,0,True,False,False

For those who have not played ME befored, a quick list of pros:
- Great story,both the main storyline and also many wonderful side quests with their own cool stroies
- Wonderful characters, the cast is great, they all have their unique traits and stories, you can be froends, enemeies or lovers of course
- romance options are great
- many, many choices throughout the game, that impact the story (okay, yes the very ending spoils this a little, but there's enough before that to still count it as a pro)

Great gameplay and incredible world (or galaxy) building. 

There was almost never a dull moment. With the expectation of cheesy, bad-ass character interactions and one-liners, it was easy for me to adjust myself to that setting and not get phased by something that most people may or may not deem as 'bad' writing. 

The role-playing is extremely immersive in my opinion, something that modern RPGs fail to succeed in. 
Even though I was playing as a pre-existing person, BioWare did a fantastic job allowing players to really make Shepard their own. 
Regardless of character appearance, background, and status, at some point it felt like I was no longer playing as Shepard, but I was playing as myself. That is a huge win in my book. 
The fact that the choices you make matter immensely throughout the entirety of the three games is amazing in itself and something I am convinced that other developers will never be able to pull off to this scale, although I wish they would try. 
The only games that have come close are episodic narratives such as Telltale's Walking Dead. 

I'm almost sad to have finished this trilogy because I fear nothing will live up to my experience. 
Given the backlash Andromeda has received, there is more than likely no comparison to the trilogy (at least not yet?) but I'm still eager to give it a try and will do my best to separate the experiences and make sure it does not tarnish the time I have spent as Shepard.

Played ME 1-3 on Xbox 360 back in the day,  so playing through on PC was a nice change.  Graphics look great through out and ran super smooth @145fps on my Msi katana GF66 with minimal buggy weirdness.  Having all the DLC's was also really nice, there's a lot of content i hadn't played before which lead me to have plenty of fresh experiences.

Highly Enjoyable.

I have finished mass effect 1 - 3 times, one on ps3, ps4 and now pc
I have finished Mass effect 2 - 6  times,  4 in a row on ps3 , once on ps4 and pc
When I finished me 2 and saw that cliffhanger, well lets just say me3 has arguably been the game that I have been the most hyped too
I have finished mass effect 3-  4 times again twice on ps3, once on ps4 and once on now pc

This is the only series I think that I have done a marathon of let alone two. 

I will rate the games especially the third with mods in mine

The games is imo very good regarding is story,  its small stories, is characters, its characters stories. The lore and world building is also excellent. The games has quiet alot of diffucult choices and you really feel like you wanna care about the characters. 

I also fine the character creation allright and I like that you can switch outfits even if they arguably could be more (not really a problem and defeintly not with mods). I also like that you feel like your character is in charge. 

I always found the first and third game to have the better story and the second one to be more about the characters and introduce more of those. 

The banter between the characters is top notch and is one of the reason that you might want to play over games to see what other characters say if you bring them along instead. The romance is all right too

I find ME 1 le gameplay/combat to be allright ,better now then it was when it was realed. The seoncd one has hold up pretty well and the third one is great. I also like especially from 2 and onward and even more so the third game that there is quiet alot of different abilities but, even more so in guns. 

Regarding the ""dlc.s"" or the more major once
I find bring down the sky allright mostly because you will see one of those characters in 3
I find overlord from me2 again for the same reason allright
Lair of the shadow broker is excellent 
The two characters dlc in 2 is also allright
Levithan is fine even if it arguably make some more question then not.
Citadel dlc even I have only done it once is excellent and might even seem like it could aswell work as an epilogue dlc. I have tried to get it to work as epilogue dlc with mod
Omega dlc , beside having two new companions, an new enemy type and revisiting Omega is allright I guess, i am not to fond of it

Me2 is one of my all time fav, game the triolgy as a whole is probably top 5 if not even higher.  

I really like after doing major quest to go talk to characters seeing what they have to say or hearing the banter between especially in the latter 2. The game has a ton of great and memorable cutscenes, dialogue ,  characters, banter and missions or moments. Walking around Citadel in me3 is just great. And playing me3 with mods is imo even better.

I wasnt really any fan of neither the orignal ending or extended cut (even if I think is a tad bit better) ending of the third game. ME3 happy ending mod fixes at least that somewhat. And there are also some other great mods beside those in spectre mod, take back earth, expanded galaxy and Anderson restorian dialogue etc. 

Great game and I will probably be playing it again and again. One of those few games, where people can mention it and I want to play it. One of those game where I can sit down a day almost reading about the series or watching youtube clips. And even more so with happy ending mods I guess, witch seems to take into more account of your choices and war assest. Reading the lore in game especially the war asset in three is also great.

Excellent games. If you want an rpg , with good story, characters and more then good enough gameplay, get this, recommended. 

PS: The last mission of me2 is still imo arguably my favourite single mission or at least last mission in a game.",1690374075,1690499867,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

So, why don't I recommend it on Steam? Why would I go out of my way to throw a red thumbs down onto something I've proclaimed that, I wholeheartedly love?

[b]Because, to put it simply, EA, in their needless, pointless pursuit of shifting from Origin > EA App, have somehow managed to bug out / completely mess up achievement acquisition for ME2 & ME3 on Steam.[/b]

At the end of the day, achievements for me are more like souvenirs from my time with a game, I won't go out of my way to tick off boxes for annoying tasks I find no enjoyment in doing, that said, something worked and now it doesn't and with EA being absolutely, pathetically useless at maintaining and supporting their pathetic excuse for software, I have no idea when a fix will come along.

Regardless of how inconsequential achievements may be, you shouldn't be giving a company your money when they knowingly avoid fixing issues with their games / leave things broken. I don't want to tell people not to buy this absolute masterclass of a space opera, I want to recommend it to people.

If you don't care about achievements, then feel free to ignore this and canon the review in your head as a glowing, thumbs up recommendation.

[b]Edit - Managed to get them to work, will repeat the steps I made here.[/b]

[i]- Go into documents > BioWare > ME:LE > Save > ME2
- Backup a copy of ""GamerProfile"" somewhere safe just in-case, then delete it.
- Boot up EA App independently alongside Steam.
- Push the EA App into offline mode, boot the game up from Steam.
- You will periodically be kicked out of the EA App and have to sign in again, when it happens, just quit the game after saving, sign back in and boot it all back up into offline mode.[/i]

This won't grant you achievements you've missed retroactively and it won't register any medals you've already acquired, but if you're halfway through a game on ME2 (or ME3? I imagine the above process works for that too) then this should allow you claim achievements going forward.

Sorry for the wall of text, though I do hope it was helpful. Please make backups of anything before you tinker with file structure based on advice from random people online. Despite being a swell guy, I'd rather you not run into headaches because of me if you do read and follow the advice.

Things i like:
The Legendary Edition gives you all three games and all their DLCs, which is great.
I liked the story, with an extremely captivating atmosphere and very important choices that matter in the next games as well. The game has many fun challenges.You can interact with all species. I recommend for each game to go through all the side quests to have a good relationship with all the alien species that will help you with the fight against the Reapers and thus a perfect ending in the last game. The game will make you think about how each decision leads to some consequences, good or bad, the choice is yours. Be careful and enjoy a wonderful trilogy.

Things i don't like:
The gameplay is nothing special. Perhaps the game is tailored to be played with a joystick rather than a keyboard and mouse. There are some bugs where you get stuck on a wall and have to reload the save. The Legendary Edition gives you all three games and all their DLCs, which is great.

Mass Effect 1: I didn't like traveling around the planets, I found it a bit boring. I think this is the game with the most bugs and auto-save doesn't save very often.
Mass Effect 2: My planet scan would have happened one idea faster.
Mass Effect 3: I didn't like the menu where the missions are because the main missions and the side missions are on the same page. Priority is indeed written on the main mission. But it didn't look right to me.
When you go to the Citadel- Docks: Holding Area, it is not optimized very well. The FPS drop to 40.

The Price for that game is a bit high for me (yes there are 3 remastered games with all DLCs), but if you manage to get it on sale for 15 euro it will be more than perfect.

When I heard about the legendary edition I was so happy to get back into it after 6-7 years. To me, the story, characters, and gameplay still hold up, making it one of my favorite game series to play. I've especially loved how your choices carry through from each game, making it feel so personal. It also helps too that you can customize Commander Shepard to how you want. 

I've heard there are issues with achievements (this is happening to me as well) and people not liking the fact that you need the EA launcher, but if we're talking about the games themselves, I didn't have any glaring issues that made it difficult to continue playing even when I first played on ps3 without mods and now legendary edition with mods. 

Obviously it's a product of its time and therefore can be a bit rough on some edges (there are some mods that help with this) but I really think this is a game series that everyone should experience atleast once, especially if you like sci-fi, rpg elements, or really investing story-telling and world building.

HEAVY CAVEAT.
You cannot play this game without also, unfortunately, being forced to download and use the EA launcher. and the EA launcher drags this game down HARD.
You will not be able to play the game through steam if the EA launcher can't connect to the internet unless you manually - through an internet connection - go and put the EA launcher to offline. So you can't play this if you're traveling, or if your internet goes out. You're SOL.
Also, the achievements for both ME2 and ME3 will probably break (mine did after the EA app had an 'unexpected error'), and you'll be unable to actually get any on Steam while the in-game view shows that you've unlocked all of them. The problem has been around since MELE was launched and EA never bothered to fix it. Fortunately, there's a reddit post detailing a fix for this, but it requires you to delete the gamer profile out of your game files, and then every single time you play the game - yes, every single time, forever - you have to start the MELE launcher, then BEFORE entering ME2/ME3, go fiddle with the EA app until it lets you alter it (it might get stuck in overlay mode, in which case you'll have to force quit it and try again), go offline, play your game, and go back into online mode after you've closed out of the game when you're done.
ME1's achievements work fine though. I have no idea how EA did this.
Also, I've been playing MELE for a month and I've ended up having to fix random infinite loading/launch failure issues by reverifying the game files (an hour long process) five times.
Also it's really odd to see some ME3 textures ported backwards into ME1. They look very strange and out of place. But that's getting into nitpicking changes and that's personal opinion territory.
So yeah, this is Mass Effect, if you love it you'll still be pretty happy with this version of it - but EA definitely sours the experience some with their downright awful app that you cannot get out of using. Keep that in mind if you buy/play this. The EA app will make you want to tear your hair out, and you will have to go through some additional steps every time you play if you want your achievements to function.",1690327868,1690327868,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

Be aware of this if you care about that sort of thing.

Edit: As of 25th July 2023, the achievements seem to work again. I have no idea why, but given that it's EA, I presume this is an unintended consequence of a mistake that broke something else. I still don't care and they didn't get any points in my book for fixing it. The achievements were supposed to work the entire time, you don't get praise for bringing me a knife and fork when I already ate the steak with my hands. The comparison is garbage, but so is EA, and so is their launcher, so it fits.

Long version:

I recommend the ME series, though it's dated. It has a lot of charm and even without nostalgia, you should find enjoyment playing them. There's a lot to see, a lot to do and there is substance here. 

I played through Mass Effect 1 & 2 years ago when I was younger, then a bug prevented me from finishing 3 just before the finish line - a bug that I couldn't fix. Anyway, at time of writing, I just finished ME1 -again- and started ME2, played that for around five hours now I think. Here's the thing: No achievements. As in, they do not pop up or register on Steam. I don't really care that they don't, they are meaningless. Life goes on. But, curious, I wondered what was causing it. Turns out, EA is at fault. Shocker, I know. And this fault is massive. Because they simply refuse to fix their product and launcher. It would be as easy as flipping a switch I presume, since the achievements work with ME1. Now, there are workarounds. I didn't try them, because I don't care that much. But, I want you, dear reader, to know that EA did their very best -intentionally or not- to make these workarounds not work, just like their launcher which caused me some frustration on its own. I had to manually update and re-install that bit of data trash 2 times now. It goes without saying that I will de-install that the very second I finish the games.

I just found it fascinating that the achievements do not work. The legendary edition - a polished version of the games. And the achievements do not work. Brilliant. EA failed at the most basic thing. The thing many, if not most, nostalgia players would be annoyed at. They failed at the most basic task. 

Despite the very minor annoyance, the games are worth playing.

This is the best gaming bundle I have ever played. I first tried playing the first mass effect years ago, but could never get into it. On a whim, I decided to give the series one last try. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life. Mass Effect is without a doubt one of the best trilogies in gaming history. I've played a lot of RPG's in my time, but few have ever impacted me the way these three games did. The story, the characters, the gameplay, and most importantly Shepherd! If you've never played the series before I can't recommend this game enough. 

All three games are good. Even over a decade later, Mass Effect 1's story and tactical combat are enough to be enjoyable. Some aspects of the game haven't aged well with time, but the characters and the story are enough to forgive whatever old game inconveniences you may encounter. I would also say the same for Mass Effect 3. It's a solid game that I enjoyed extremely well.

But what you're really getting your money's worth out of with this title is Mass Effect 2. I've played many games throughout my life, and I can confidently say without a shred of doubt that Mass Effect 2 is one of the best games I have ever played. The story is spectacular, the characters are riveting, and the iconic character of Commander Shepherd is at their best in this title. Both voice actors are great throughout the series, but Jennifer Hale delivers one of the best voice acting performances I've ever seen in a game since I first played through RDR2. I found myself completely enraptured by the character of Shepherd, to the point that Mass Effect 2 is one of the few games I've played that I never wanted to end. 

If you've never played the series before, I can't recommend this series enough. I wish I would have gotten into it sooner.",1690276994,1690276994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition fits the title. Sure, it may just mean it has the first (and as far as most of us are concerned) only three games in the series as well as *most* of the DLC, but it's also LEGENDARY. Prepared to be pulled into a world full of interesting characters, deep lore, some good romance options (and some not so much), and lots and lots of decisions, most of which actually impact different aspects of the game, some big impacts and some little. The game's cast is generally absolutely incredible. The characters most people would agree are the best among the bunch truly are some of the greatest characters in the history of gaming. You may pick this up just expecting a space game with a little story and some shooting, and you'd be on the track, but it's much more than that. Mass Effect is about choosing to be a good guy or a bad guy (not really much in between) but using that and the decisions you make to bolster your team and allies against ever-growing threats. If you ask me, Wrex, Liara, Tali, Garrus, Mordin, Aria, Samara, Captain Anderson, Grunt, Thane, Miranda, Jack, Legion, Javik, EDI, and Joker all left lasting impacts on me where I'll remember them fondly for the rest of my life. A *usually* well written story and characters you can grow bonds with and truly get to know combine together to have you clinging to the game til its conclusion like a new TV show that has you hooked on its cliffhangers. There are some good romance options here as well. I, for one, will stand by the wifey of the series, Liara, til the day I die. She's intelligent, friendly, has an interesting backstory, and has a relationship with Shepard that is sweet and can make it through anything. Best of all, she's available to both male and female Shepard. I hear Tali is a great option, but seeing her end up with (SPOILER ALERT AHEAD) Garrus, who is CLEARLY Shepard's best friend and deservedly so, near the end of Mass Effect 3 was very heartwarming. 

Let's break it down a little bit.

Mass Effect 1 has the story, it introduces us to some of the characters we will get to know and love. It kicks things off establishing the importance of your decisions and is a great start to the series. Unfortunately, it also has the Mako. I'd highly recommend at least getting a mod to fix the Mako downloaded off of Nexus and make sure you install it properly. 

Mass Effect 2 is generally the one people consider the strongest of the series, and for good reason. The story picks up, grows, and so does Shepard and those around him/her. The pressure picks up while you continue your love interest or start a new one (which will also happen in Mass Effect 3 of course). This one introduces us to even more great characters and stories. The gameplay is much better from this point in the series. Where they thankfully took the Mako out, they threw in some annoying lockpicking mini games (they're not too bad, but sometimes seem to just get in the way).

The third and final installment of the trilogy continues the main story like the final chapter of a great book. You meet more great characters and companions. The gameplay improves and so do the graphics. There are some truly great moments in Mass Effect 3, and I feel some people like to leave this factor out because they want to take a dump all over the ending. I didn't think the ending was terrible, but it certainly lacked in some aspects and the story as a whole sometimes was a little off in this round. Regardless, Mass Effect 3 is barely the weakest of a great trilogy of games that I'd recommend to anybody. (ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT) I also should add that Mass Effect 3 gives us one of the hardest decisions when you have Mordin alive but not Wrex. Wrex's brother Wreav is not a good Krogan and will make a terrible leader should you do the ""right thing"" by assisting Mordin in curing the genophage. Not having enough points toward Paragon or Renegade (whichever it was or both) to talk Wrex down in Mass Effect 1 on Virmire will have him killed, which you'll severely regret. Wreav is a fine character, but not at all a good ""person"". Wrex has vision. Wrex would actually lead the Krogan in a great direction. Thus, you may have to kill Mordin to keep him from actually curing the genophage, someone who is easily one of the most lovable characters in the franchise. It was heartbreaking.

I didn't pick up Mass Effect because it was a space game or a shooter. I picked it up to get enthralled in an interesting world with great stories and incredible characters while making decisions that matter, and Mass Effect almost always hits the nail on the head with all of these. The fact it was a space game and a shooter actually is what made me disinterested for many years. I finally gave in once I heard it was much more than that, and I'm so glad I did.

It's also worth adding that Mass Effect gave us two of the greatest antagonists in all of gaming- Saren and The Illusive Man. Saren, a powerful and clever rogue Spectre who aligns himself and becomes controlled by the actual overarching antagonist(s) of the series, really shines in Mass Effect 1 whereas we will love and hate The Illusive Man in both Mass Effect 2 and 3 as he provides an extremely deep character who fits in perfectly with the franchise and main story.

After putting 80 hours into the trilogy on my PlayStation 5, it is a truly a collection of three of the greatest games I've ever played.

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition gets a 4.5/5 for me. I don't regret a second of the hours I spent on the three games and you won't either. If you catch it on a good sale, just get it. Buy it so Bioware hurries up and gives us a real Mass Effect 4. Bravo on these three, Bioware. Bravo.",1690265927,1690266650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

« Entrer dans la légende, risquer de devenir un mirage » :

Dans cette édition « Légendaire », les joueuses et joueurs sont invités à faire l’ensemble des DLC (40 annoncés sur la page Steam !) et la version étendue de ME3, parce qu’il semble que la fin n’était pas assez satisfaisante pour la majorité des joueurs et que les développeurs n’ont pas assumés et ont préférés la retravailler. Pour commencer, je précise que je ne la connais pas cette fin originale, je sais que se montrer à l’écoute des joueurs est souvent plutôt bien perçu, mais je reste très circonspect car là il s’agit d’une trilogie, longue, intelligemment menée et mis à part un travail qui aurait été bâclé au point d’impacter les ventes, je ne vois pas ce qui a pu faire infléchir les choses. Quoiqu’il en soit, la fin proposée est satisfaisante car elle mène à une résolution qu’effectivement je visais dans ma partie, mais je ne suis pas forcément convaincu par le sacrifice messianique final, ni par l’oubli du Leviathan ou des Collectors (qui ne sont pas entièrement éradiqués).

Maintenant, d’un autre point de vue, il s’agit d’une édition présentée comme remasterisée et vendue en 2021 pour 60 euros. Elle a mis beaucoup de temps avant d’arriver dans cet état : 9 années entre ME3 et ME.LE. Et là, c’est nettement plus problématique. D’abord, sur les 3 jeux, ce sont les mêmes moteurs (graphiques, physiques etc.) qui sont employés, normalement, cela permet de mettre à jour et d’uniformiser sensiblement plus facilement les contenus. Ainsi, l’aspect graphique est censé avoir été retravaillé. Mis à part certains effets, ce n’est pas le cas, indéniablement. C’est vrai les jeux ont bien vieilli, mais les écarts entre le premier et le dernier sont majeurs et certaines textures ou autres effets avaient déjà besoin d’amour à la sortie des jeux originaux (par exemple l’eau c’est de l’huile !). Passons, disons que l’investissement pour la partie graphique ne pouvait pas se faire raisonnablement.

Pour commencer doucement, le fait de pouvoir récupérer sa/son Shepard d’un jeu à l’autre est clairement l’un des points forts de la série, c’est indéniable. Mais dans les faits, c’est assez sous-estimé, en particulier dans le deuxième épisode qui a tenté un redémarrage, il n’y a pas vraiment de continuité si ce n’est celle de l’apparence du personnage : à posteriori, il aurait pu être bon d’importer plus du premier épisode, comme son arme fétiche, des cicatrices, des choix de discours qui ont déterminé notre personnalité et qui nous empêcheraient d’être incohérents face à certaines situations… Autrement, j’ai croisé beaucoup de PNJ qui semblaient mieux polygonés que ma Shepard dans le troisième jeu, y compris des humains. Ensuite, il est relativement dommageable de constater que dans le premier jeu, les PNJ se ressemblent vraiment beaucoup au sein d’une même espèce, qu’il n’y a pas d’enfant avant ME3 (oui, un seul mais tout de même), et quasi pas de vieillard.

Mais, et si vous avez survécu à la lecture de cette critique jusque-là, vous me voyez venir, les aspects qui sont dramatiquement mis de côté, c’est le système de jeu, l’ergonomie générale et les menus. Ce n’est pas qu’une uniformisation n’a pas été réussie, c’est qu’elle n’a même pas été essayée en réalité, et mis à part l’interface dans ME1 qui a été vaguement liftée, il n’y a aucune cohérence entre les 3 jeux. Par exemple, ce n’est pas comme la trilogie remasterisée de Mafia où les 3 jeux sont vendus séparément et donc on ne s’attend pas nécessairement à l’uniformité du système. Ici, il faut, pour avoir l’édition légendaire, racheter les 3 jeux et ensuite, il y a vraiment de graves soucis inhérents à des gestions d’inventaires ou d’options, qui sont des choix que les développeurs auraient pu rectifier. Certes, il ne serait pas possible de tout incrémenter d’un jeu à l’autre (par exemple, les QTE, dans ME1 impliquerait beaucoup trop de réécriture etc.), mais se retrouver devant un ensemble sans-cesse perfectible et décousu est très gênant. J’ai beaucoup évoqué les soucis de contrôle et de mapping (le sprint, la touche multifonction) dans les critiques, s’ajoutent les collisions du personnage, les gestions d’inventaire et de manque de logique intra-diégétique permanents au dessus desquels il faut passer, sans oublier l’ergonomie piteuse des menus (ne pas pouvoir regarder le journal de quête sur la carte galactique est vraiment pénible et inexplicable). Il n’y a eu ni réflexion, ni prise en compte que les résolutions des écrans de 2007-2012 ne sont plus celles de 2021 et permettent d’afficher proprement des menus et des interfaces mieux construites.

Mais si l’on évoque ne serait-ce que l’exploration des planètes c’est aussi franchement très triste de constater qu’au fur et à mesure, de moins en moins d’options nous sont accessibles. ME1 c’était tout de même la promesse d’une immensité à explorer ! Déjà dans ME2, ça sent le roussi mais il y a tout de même quelques moments d’exploration. Dans ME3, c’est du hasard, du superficiel, l’envoi d’une sonde sur une planète et c’est plié, on redécolle. Était-il si impossible que ça d’importer le matériel d’un jeu à l’autre ? Comme d’employer la même carte galactique pour l’ensemble des trois jeux ? Imaginez, si les explorations des trois jeux (à la fois les systèmes de jeu et les découvertes réalisées) pouvaient se cumuler à travers les 3 ME, cela résoudrait beaucoup des soucis de mollesse, de répétitivité voire d’inutilité que l’on pouvait ressentir dans ME1 et 2. Ici, tout a été abandonné peu à peu. Pour évoquer les endroits les plus explorables (Citadelle, Thessia, Tuchanka, Omega etc.) il aurait pu être intéressant de cumuler les environnements des trois ME et, même sans les rendre directement utiles, les laisser accessibles en permanence leur donnerait enfin une envergure immense et pas simplement l’impression d’avoir échoué dans une ville aléatoire. Ne serait-ce qu’un panneau pour dire « dans le prochain jeu tu pourras aller là-bas », cela contribuerait encore davantage à la cohérence entre les épisodes.

De fait, à l’évidence j’ai été berné par cette promesse de « Légendaire » et je ne suis pas du tout en phase avec cette philosophie de développement qui consiste à incrémenter un système, se rendre compte que c’est bancale (en pratique il n’y a rien qui ne marche pas du tout non plus), le laisser agoniser tel-quel et le supprimer du jeu suivant au lieu d’avoir cherché à le rectifier. Je m’attendais tout de même à plus d’ambition : soixante euros pour 3 jeux qui ont entre 9 et 14 ans, et qui ...

You're Commander Shepard, a Human Systems Alliance Marine officer, who finds out about an imminent threat and has to rally as many allies as possible to the cause of defeating a mysterious and threatening enemy against seemingly impossible odds.

With highly cinematic presentation and storytelling, excellent sound design, top-notch voice acting, solid writing, epic music, you feel like you're the protagonist of a fantasy sci-fi thriller reminiscent of Blade Runner and Star Trek.  There are enough RPG elements to customize your Shepard and squadmates to your liking, and equip yourself and your squad to fit your combat playstyle as well as decide what skills and gear you need for the next mission.

The remaster treatment has smoothed rough edges, added modern visuals and QoL features, and discarded annoyances from the originals such as the lenthy elevator rides (that hid loading screens).  The package includes 40 DLC, leaving out only the combat arena from ME1, which didn't really fit in narratively with the rest of the game.  There's also no multiplayer in ME3, but the campaign adjusts things so that multiplayer is no longer a necessary grind for getting the best possible campaign endings.

[h1]ADDITION FOR THE ""THUMBS DOWN""-Update[/h1]
I cannot find any proof that I own Mass Effect 3 game or Crysis 2, which I still have a DVD at home.
Guess EA simply deleted these games from my account. Well thanks, you greedy fucks!
At least I took a screenshot back then from Origin, so that's something...
______________________________________________

Only touched part 1 and 2 on Steam recently for testing out how they run on a new system, but never bothered playing them again fully, as of having to install Origin once more for the last part.


However, now Valve and EA seem to have an agreement again. And Origin behaves pretty subtle. You start the game on Steam, Origin starts and launches the game and if you leave the game, Origin closes automatically.

I know monopolies arean't really a healthy thing for the market, but Steam was and is THE gaming platform. But yeah, it's a market and other companies see the potential and try to get into it.
I never was that happy about this crappy ""[u]you launch the XY Company-launcher over Steam which then launches the game[/u]""-madness, but that's what we got out of this whole thing and a solution I learned to live with Ubisoft games.

As the Mass Effect legendary edition makes a few things different, there is even an own Nexus Mod page for it:
https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffectlegendaryedition
I'm happy to have all in one pack. :)

If you can stand having Steam launching another launcher, you rather may choose this version over the other ones.
Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 on Steam still do NOT require Origin.
However, even the Steam-version of Mass Effect 3 requires Origin, so to complete the franchise you require it anyways or have to stick to 1 and 2.


I personally really liked that this franchise got completed, even though I wasn't that happy about some decisions regarding story-telling, but the conclusions are acceptable especially after the Extended Cut DLC, which is already indluced in the Legendary Edition.

[h1]BE AWARE![/h1]

I enjoyed it. I think it makes the mistake of 'starting off generic' which it shouldn't have done but that doesn't last long. It takes the premise of 'humans being new to a inter-species society' and explores it well with a lot of the plot starting because of humanity wanting a larger role in that society. The other species we see are also very interesting from the exiled quarians, the dying yet violent krogen and many more. They have unique backgrounds to them and interactions that we usually don't see in sci fi works. The combat is simplistic but its fun enough. I liked the skill tree and use of companions in combat tho I think the game throws xp and points at the player.



[h1] Mass Effect 2 [/h1] 

Mass Effect 2 is an improvement over Mass Effect 1 in pretty much every way that matters. The set up from the start is a lot more engaging compared to ME1. The main quest feels a lot more **proactive** than most stories in these kinds of games. It expands on the lore with more interesting things. Companions are a lot more interesting here with proper companion quests with a good incentive for the player to actually do them. Combat encounters and sidequests are also much more varied than the first game. Exploring planets leads to more unique situations instead of just moving around in a shitty rover. The replacement rover is much better too. The situations the player is thrust into also feel a lot more unique and interesting. The Illusive Man was a very interesting character. Combat itself is _much_ better. I think this is the most I've enjoyed a shooter tho tbf I have not played a lot of shooters. Special moves are a lot faster and give more uses. Guns are far more responsive(except for shotgun). My one complaint is levelling up being very simplified and with less possible variety.

Mass effect 1 felt like the beginnings of the idea of making an action sci fi movie shooter with actually good RPG elements and characters but mass effect 2 is where it is properly realized.


[h1] Mass Effect 3 [/h1] 

I've heard some people say that 'mass effect 3 is good except than the ending' but I disagree with that statement. I had tempered my expectations after hearing about this being a polarizing game but they managed to disappoint. It starts of very strong with the first few missions in general being very good. However, after finishing [spoiler]Moridin's[/spoiler] quest, the game just fell apart in my eyes.
The choices given did not feel as varied or interesting compared to ME2 and there was this pervasive sense of 'genericness' to everything which is surprising considering how unique the setting is in general. The [spoiler]Geth-Quarian questline showcased this the most as the Geth are reduced from one of the most unique races in the setting to some of the most generic one by going back to the often-repeated idea of 'individuality = life' even tho ME1 and 2 had a more unique take on their collective intelligence and life.[/spoiler] The game builds up Kai Lang but just no. He is dumb, edgy and stupid. They made the [spoiler]illusive man[/spoiler] stupider and more boring. I do not like the choice of squadmates at all. [spoiler]Garrus and Tali[/spoiler] are really the only ones I was happy to see return. Ede should not be a squad mate. [spoiler]Liara[/spoiler] is eh. I already forgor who else was available.  The entire end sequence is very dull and the way endings are decided just broke for me so I just had to watch the endings on YouTube
 
On the gameplay side it is easily an upgrade. Gunplay is better, skills are better, skill tree is better, etc. I like the shotguns.

[b]Pros[/b]: Mass Effect trilogy is one of the best scifi games and one of the best games ever made. This is peak bioware, awesome writing, fantastic characters, great universe to explore, great gameplay that varies between each game. Dont listen to people hating on one specific game of the trilogy, all games are equally fantastic. If you didnt play this game I have no idea what were you doing with your life.

[b]Cons[/b]: EA ... that should explain absolutely everything ... EA putting their stinky grubby claws on this franchise is one of the worst things of our timeline.

1.[b]EA App[/b] - Brand new cancer for your computer, its required to run the game. It doesnt work half of the time, doesnt run the other half, crashes all the time. Not to mention all kinds of issues like your game automatically assigning to wrong account, garbage EA customer support etc ..

2.[b]Steam achievements DONT WORK[/b] -  If you like collecting achievements avoid this game for unspecified amount of time until EA fixes their garbage launcher. Due to EA being bunch of schmucks this new Origin will mess up your save and automatically unlock all achievements. 
This means when you actually complete some achievements, they will NOT unlock on steam. In addition to this there are some achievements that dont work no matter what. [i] There are some workarounds for this, like turning your EA app offline while in the launcher menu, where you select which ME you wan to play, but EA app will throw out error after some time, because they dont want people to play offline and you have to restart the app and the game, any achievs unlocked during time the error is up will not count[/i] Most common fix to forcibly install old origin doesnt work anymore.

3.[b]LE changes[/b] - almost not worth it. There are some changes that could be called improvements, like ME1 now reaching lvl 58 (still not 60) so you dont have to play through each game twice to get all the stuff. But majority of stuff is unchanged. Graphical update sucks, there is just bit more lighting in some scenes, making the old outdated models look weird, rest is untouched. 
Many QoL changes like being able to exit galaxy map still not present. Weird things like Javik not having reset skill tree option in ME3 still unchanged for no reason. 
ME2 and ME3 are practically unchanged in terms of graphics and since they already had many of the QoL changes over ME1 there is very little improvement.

4.[b]Bugs and issues[/b] - Origin being garbage aside, gameplay issues and bugs were almost untouched. From your minor things like characters getting stuck on objects to stuff like major events not being written into your saves properly. 
Lots of new AI bugs, enemies ceasing to react, companions getting stuck after cutscenes. If you play on PC, SET FPS TO 60 MAX, otherwise your shields wont regenerate, definitely an issue that should have been fixed in a remaster. 
Its insulting how much broken stuff was left in from the original game and how much more stuff EA managed to break.

5.[b]No online[/b] - no multiplayer, no bioware network nothing, yet you need to use EA app and you need to be online or the EA app starts acting up.

Played the original games when they came out, but if you look at the past list of DLC's that was one pain that this version solves thankfully.

I wish they did change certain aspects (like the endings of the 3rd game)

ME3Tweaks Mod Manager
LE3 Community Patch
Audemus' Happy Ending Mod
Citadel Epilogue Mod

ME1:
This really feels like an experiment for the devs and only like a setup for the other games in the series. It is good, but not great overall. 

The gameplay is a bit clunky, combat is kind of boring due to how dumb the AI is (both friendly and enemy) but the gunplay was surprisingly good due to nice gunsounds. The Mako is just horrendous and I dreaded each time I had to use it in side and main quests. Really floaty and unresponsive. Side quests are veeery repetative and not very good either. The different planets and locations go from ok to pretty bad and barren (at least side quests, most main quest have varied and nice locations.  

But where the game truly shines is in the story, lore and characters department. Characters have alot of personality and nice backstories. The story (and lore as they are quite intertwined) is super engaging and just really well told, and I especially like how it feels like you truly make an impact. The whole series feels like it was designed with the main intention of choices having consequenses that carry over which is really nice. But I do kind of find it a shame that the choices are so telegraphed in if they are ""evil"" or ""good"", but I like it either way.

If looking at only the gameplay it is hard to recommend, but the story, lore, characters and how it all carries over to the sequels more than make up for it imo.

Are there faults? Yes. Has it aged well? I would argue the case for a very strong 'yes', but even with a refresh these games are still a product of their time - albeit a very polished one. To me this just adds to the nostalgia of the series; your mileage may vary. To this day, I have never since played a game or series of games which invests me so deeply into the characters around me in such a powerful way.

Well writen characters, great story. The game itself is replayable.
After replaying me1 and me2 I was suprised there was still new stuff I didn't get to experience bcs of my previous choices. 

Besides a couple lags in me1, not working achievement system and couple bugs in me3 that threw me out to the main screen.
The score for this trilogy 9/10.

Can't wait for more of this universe, I would love to play a spinoff with Garrus as the main character.

Through the haze of these frosty realities, Mass Effect Legendary Edition was a beacon of hope, an unexpected savior that melted my frozen heart, and stoked a flame that I thought had long been extinguished. 🕯️❄️

Now, I'm not usually one for remakes, but Bioware's Mass Effect Legendary Edition, a remastered version of the original Mass Effect trilogy, was something else. It was like the comforting warmth of a hot chocolate on a cold, winter's day, sipped slowly while watching the snowflakes dance outside your window. 🌨️🍫

In essence, the Legendary Edition weaves the journey of Commander Shepard, who, whether donning the mantle of a male or a female, fights gallantly against the ominous threats lurking in the farthest corners of the universe. Joining Shepard are colorful characters like the mysterious Liara T'Soni, the ever-so-loyal Garrus Vakarian, the technology prodigy Tali'Zorah, and the ferocious Wrex. The narrative propels itself across a variety of planets, star systems, spaceships, and space stations, all unified by a single purpose - the survival of all organic life forms against the relentless onslaught of the Reapers.

Now, let's cut to the chase. 🐾🎮

#Graphics: The graphics have been lifted from the original to a level I never thought possible. Each character, each texture, each planet, it's all crisp, clear, and beautifully rendered. The polish on the graphics alone justifies the price tag, in my opinion. From the way the armor glistens in the sun to the detailed alien worlds, each element is stunning, a visual feast for the senses. 🌌🌠

#Gameplay: The Legendary Edition includes all three games with revamped mechanics. The shooting, the exploration, the RPG elements, everything feels more streamlined and modernized. And the best part? All the DLCs are included! That alone had me salivating, my tail wagging uncontrollably. 🐾

#Story: The story in Mass Effect has always been its strongest asset. In the Legendary Edition, it's no different. The same compelling narrative, now presented in a more immersive setting, further amplifies the emotional stakes. But be warned, the choices you make, the lives you decide to save, or the ones you sacrifice, will determine the fate of entire civilizations. 🌌

#Impact: The Legendary Edition stands as a towering testament to the enduring legacy of the Mass Effect series. With this remastered version, Bioware has rejuvenated interest in the franchise, prompting both veterans and newcomers to embark on this epic journey. It is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best video game remakes to date. 🎮💎

#Evaluation: As an old hand at gaming, supporting indie developers, kickstarting projects, and avidly consuming all forms of entertainment, from manga to anime to movies, I've seen the gaming industry evolve. Yet, the Mass Effect Legendary Edition holds a special place in my heart. It is an unforgettable journey that every gamer must experience. ⭐️🎮

As Kiba Snowpaw, a Furry gamer who's invested thousands of dollars and countless hours into supporting and kickstarting numerous projects, and watched countless series and read countless manga since the 80s, I can unequivocally state that this game is worth every penny. It revitalized my love for gaming, and reignited the fire within me, proving once again that in the midst of adversity, there's always a beacon of hope, a silver lining.

In conclusion, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a stunning triumph, a game that showcases the potential of remasters done right. As a gaming gem that sparkles with spectacular graphics, riveting gameplay, and a profound narrative, it embodies the magic of video games, their ability to transport us to different worlds, to let us lead different lives, and above all, to feel, deeply and intensely.

So whether you're an icy-hearted Wolf like me, or just another adventurer thirsting for an epic saga, brace yourself for a rollercoaster ride through the cosmos. And remember, in the end, we're all part of the same pack. We are all, in the grand scheme of things, interconnected in this vast universe, fighting for the same cause, for survival, for life, and for hope. 🐺💙🌌

Do not play them for the  ME3 ending they ran out of time to flesh it out, do your research on this game for the 'canon' one which is the best out come in my opinion. The relationships and with in depth camaraderie between them and Commander Shepard( male or female)  makes you replay over and over again, try to save everyone as much as you can play ALL the  DLC yeah even the 'yawn' ones you get extra everything within story in-game, Citadel party is a  thank you to the fans and to us playing it.  ALL games have flaws online on PC or Console  or offline.  Now that being said, next to Metal Gear Solid- PS1 version.  

This is the greatest experience to have been blessed by Valve/Steam for this opportunity to play them after all these years but never got the chance .  In my opinion from my own experience no other games so far  in terms of story, relationships, friendships pure adrenaline rush action with loyalty and heart within production comes close despite the 'patti and cocoa bread' cut-out from between ME2 and ME3 from complainers who always complain. 

I'am now more about experiencing the art from gaming that have a bit of everything with the longest longevity instead of linear mission specific chapter campaign games.  

Playing games is playing games as I still do time to time. Experiencing games is respect for the art in motion.  Garrus  and the other comrades is waiting for me at the bar.

The first being a bit of a Skyrim re-release with some really nice extras to it.  Second is, unusually, like how I would describe Saints Row 4 ""a love letter to a franchise"" and that's what it does, faithfully.  Albeit, almost anyway with a few discrepancies, mainly bugs sadly, holding it back.  In this review, I will primarily being covering the various alterations alongside with it's issues as elements like the story serve no relevance here.  Fear not to those who might be new to the series as there are more than plenty of other reviews out there that cover these topics in particular.  If it's not already obvious then yes, I do recommend this title at full price which, from my point of view, at £60 is a steal (more so if it's on sale) seen as your given a whole collection of games plus their additional dlc's into one bundle.

We begin with the big topic regarding to the first entry in the series which has been remastered and I have to be honest with you, my fellow reader.  It's awesome!  Astonishing really the effort put into it from it's gorgeous visual aspects (better if they had a Halo style system of switching graphics) to areas you wouldn't normally think of like sound design and even the user interface has been overhauled.  Not only that, it also has made a few nice tweaks to both it's combat as well as vehicle handling, notably it's physics I'm referring to with the list of changes still going on and on.  Because of this, it's almost kicked the second title of it's throne as my favourite Mass Effect game of all time.  There are a few drawbacks though, a few locations do feel as if they need a bit more brushing up for visual improvement plus the lack of any changes to side missions is a huge missed opportunity.  namely with things such as placing in cutscenes or additional dialogue playing in the background for extra immersion.  In a twist of irony, the worse thing the remaster has done is appear nigh on graphically superior to the other two games, Mass Effect 2 being the unfortunate victim here.  I say this because you barely notice much different with the other two title's other than the odd adjustment.  An example of this is the controversial camera angles that I personally feel much more comfortable with now than what I had on screen before in their previous adaptations.  At the time of writing this, I in fact nearly forgot the newly added photo mode that you can use for all three games at any given available time however, I do wish there were extra options such as being able to pose your character or even squad members.

Now, count this edition lucky in terms of the bugs because it was very rare for me to find however, to my knowledge there are tons of reported issues from other people so that might be worth keeping in mind when thinking about your purchase.  Mass Effect 1, couldn't see a bug in sight from what I could tell apart from the frame complication that you would expect to perform on a Windows XP.  If your one of those that has a relatively good pc then just run the program on high performance in the graphics settings and hopefully it's solved the problem.  Mass Effect 2 plus a little bit in number 3 has a strange dialogue delay where characters won't say anything for short period of time and the subtitles will continue, often skipping the audio at the very end of their speech.  On the subject of the second entry, absolutely nothing has been done to the way Shepard clips with objects.  It's a literal joke when your walking perfectly on the ground one second only to then notice yourself suspending on top of a load of equipment as evident from the Krogan triage/research area in Tuchanka.  Lastly, be careful on the Citadel party in third instalment as there is what I believe to be strange error when clicking the invite button, mainly the invite all button that I only tried using.  What it does is it triggers a conversation regarding the party that you can easily back out off whenever you please to which your probably asking yourself ""well, what's so bad about that then?"".  Unfortunately, after selecting it once, it happens to always initiate and effect other options in that terminal like the casual hangout choice thus resulting in scenes that are hilariously crashed with people just standing around like a complete pair of planks.

For this last section, this has no real impact on this review but I just want to briefly talk about Mass Effect 3 which no doubt a lot of you will know what I'm on about here.  Originally I was going to say that if there was one thing I would of liked to see altered in the third game then it would be the ending, particularly the first option your presented with as that was what the main plot encouraged throughout the story, let alone the entire trilogy.  However, there is a mod, thankfully, that does the job for that so that defeats that argument.  Either way, I'd be lying to myself because there are a lot areas in this title that have some rough edges around them that can stick out like a sore thumb at times.  My point is, as much of a mountain of a task it sounds, the idea of a remake is always on the table for me or, in this case, just the odd few reworks would work to make this feel unquestionably ""legendary"".",1689524088,1689524088,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'm changing this to a down-vote. My whole purpose of purchasing LE was so I could play ME3. (I already bought and played ME1 and ME2 separately in the past).

Due to a bug with a few terminals in ME3 that only seem to affect me, and basically left my stuck in a location with no way out unless I rolled back hours of play to an old save... I'm stuck on ME3 and can't finish it. I'm tired of having to deal with buggy games. ME LE has been out for ages, so they're not going to fix any more bugs. I'm stuck with the issue. So, the whole reason I bought ME LE, to get through ME3, is basically wasted since I can't due to a bug.

Decided to uninstall the game, and give it a down-vote.

I can't in good conscience recommend a game that has a bug that prevents me from playing / progressing in it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Orig review

+ decent story
+ characters that actually have character
+ decisions you make in each game can carry over to next game

- 80% walking simulator
- plot railroads you some times, regardless of choices
- annoying, time-wasting ""mini games"" to mine resources and other junk
- some character classes have boring skills
- tries to cram romances down your throat every step of the way (this might be a positive if you're into that sort of thing)

- ME1 has boring side quests
- ME2 has you gather a team, then forgets most of them for ME3
- ME3 doubles-down on annoying ""fetch / scavenger hunt"" side quests
- ME3 still has game-breaking bugs for some folks (like me)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mass Effect is a product of its time, where RPG dev studios would say their games had ""50+ hrs of game play!"", but that really meant the player was forced to trudge back-n-forth through environments 80% of the time without any real plot or action going on. Just you getting from point A to point B, and probably back to point A again, over and over, in an effort to chase the next plot point.

There's maybe only 10 hrs of real plot spread out over the 3 games. But, you'll spend countless hours flying, driving, walking to get where you need to go. (I've got 120 hrs on Steam so far, and that's ME1 + ME2 + 1/2 of ME3.. woof)

The game is a bit insulting at times, b/c there's often a galaxy-wide threat going on, but you're off messing around with some side quest to survey minerals on planets, or find some rando that's in trouble, or whatever. You're the galaxy's only hope, but go ahead and go mess around for a bit.. the plot will still be here when you get done with that. (This is true for open-world RPG's, but it's just odd how you can go faff about all you want without any consequences in most cases. I think in ME3 they started putting timers on certain events to entice urgency. But, I still went faffing about, and didn't suffer any repercussions for it.)

As you progress, you start to get immersed in the game world. You notice your actions shape outcomes, not just in the game you're playing, but in the next as well. And, you'll meet some entertaining characters you'll form bonds with, some of which you might actually feel an emotional attachment to if they end up dying or having to leave you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mass Effect 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ME1 has you wandering around places, and many places just don't have much going on. It's the first game, they do a lot of world building, etc. But, it's pretty sparse.

Then you fly to planets, and land, leaving you to drive the galaxy's most janky, wobbly vehicle ever created: the mako. Apparently ME fans have a ""love it or hate it"" relationship with it. Personally, I hate it.

Planets are a scavenger hunt of stuff, and often have outlandishly high mountain terrain. So, you're stuck trying to drive up 80 degree slopes, or work your way around to see if something's interesting in some corner of the map. The only ""interesting"" stuff you find are mineral deposits (for money) or some piece of space junk that has a little blurb of text about something that doesn't really impact you. So, it never feels worth it.

Eventually, you gather a team, kill a ""big bad"", and move on.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mass Effect 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ME2 takes place a couple of years after events of ME1, so all your old buddies have gone off to start new lives.

So, ME2 spends 80% of it's time revolving around ""putting together a team"". It feels like a heist movie, except, once you actually get the team together, you don't commit a heist.

ME2 has better side quests, many of which involve solving a problem to recruit someone, then solving another side quest for them to gain their full loyalty.

But, there's so many team members, it feels awkward only being able to bring along 2 folks on missions. You've got Ocean's 11 sitting back on your ship, while only 3 of you are off taking care of business. Seems like a drastic waste of several peoples' time and talent to just sit on a ship waiting for 3 folks to get back. But, I digress.

The game ends with, once again, killing a ""big bad"" and watching some of your team possibly die. Hopefully the ones you don't care about. ""Team A will consist of everyone I give a d**n about, who will sit around drinking hot cocoa by the fire. Meanwhile, Team B will consist of this team member I can't stand, who I hope goes and dies in a fire. Any questions?""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mass Effect 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ME3 starts 6 months after events in ME2 with your character railroaded as a ""scaremonger"" for warning everyone about the very real threats s/he's already stopped TWICE (in ME1 and ME2), b/c ""politics"". So, feels a bit ham-fisted.

What also feels ham-fisted is within 6 mo's time, your entire squad you spent all that time putting together in ME2 promptly faffed-off to go do something else with their lives, many of which are never heard nor seen from again in the series. It really makes the player feel special when a majority of their time in a previous game is promptly swept under the rug.

ME3 has even more entertaining side quests, and you're putting together a team again (albeit a smaller one). And, the Reaper threat is now very real and very present in the galaxy.

Unfortuantely, I wasn't able to finish ME3, b/c there's a game-breaking bug that only I seem to be experiencing. On a few terminals/ computers, the UI auto-scrolls the cursor down as if some phantom is pressing the ""down"" arrow key on my keyboard. There is a mission where you absolutely need to select the top message on the email terminal long enough for it to gray-out as ""read"". Since I can't keep the cursor on that email long enough due to the cursor constantly down-arrowing on me, I'm stuck. I can't activate the exit to that level, and there's no way for me to get out of that mission. My saves either put me right back in that level, or way WAY back where I'd have to slog hours through the game again.

So, I'm basically done.

I was into party-based RPG's when I was younger, but not really any more. I played ME 1 and ME 2 long ago when they came out. Then EA made ME 3 an EA store exclusive. I swore I'd never get it as long as it was EA store-only. So, when Legendary Edition came to Steam, I finally bought it. Whole point was to play ME 3, and finish the story. But, now I'm stuck on a game-breaking bug, and my ""give a s***"" factor has worn off.

ok, onto the review.

while getting this is certainly better than getting the 3 games individually, this feels like we, the players, were cut short of a spectacular experienced compared to RE4 remake and Dead Space remake. this ""legendary edition"" was auto upscaled by an AI and it feels like little to no manual labor was actually done on the games themselves.
ME1 stands to benefit the most from a remake, ME2 is still kinda good as-is but could certainly used hand-tuned graphics as well as multiple bug fixes (I've had to replay entire sections due to undying enemies outside the game). ME3 is good as-is but could be better (see popular mods from Nexus).
still a great, fun experience to replay these, I'll just always wonder what could've been if BioWare had done actual work instead of getting an AI to do it for them.

Heroic acts and sacrifices become essential to unravel the mysteries surrounding the enigmatic Reapers.

With the fate of countless lives at stake, Shepard's every decision carries weight, balancing on the precipice of bravery and fear. Amidst heart-pounding encounters, bone-chilling adversaries, and heart-wrenching choices, the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance, leaving players exhilarated, on edge, and yearning for victory against insurmountable odds.

The Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition is a monumental achievement in the gaming industry, offering players an extraordinary journey through the stars that has been beautifully remastered. As a die-hard fan of the original trilogy, I can confidently say that this collection surpasses all expectations. BioWare's dedication to enhancing every aspect of the game, from visuals to gameplay mechanics, has resulted in an unparalleled gaming experience that immerses players in an expansive science fiction universe like never before.

One of the most striking improvements in the Legendary Edition is the remastered visuals. The upgraded character models, environments, and special effects breathe new life into the already captivating universe. Each location, whether it's the bustling Citadel or the desolate landscapes of Tuchanka, now boasts stunning details and a greater sense of realism. The improvements extend to the trilogy as a whole, ensuring consistency in quality and enhancing the overall immersion.

The gameplay refinements in the Legendary Edition truly shine, making the combat encounters feel more dynamic and engaging. BioWare has implemented a unified aiming and cover system across all three games, providing a seamless experience. The combat mechanics have been polished, making gunplay smoother and more responsive. Additionally, the Mako sections in the first game have been reworked, offering a more enjoyable planetary exploration experience. The tweaks and adjustments made to the trilogy make it feel like a cohesive and seamless journey from start to finish.

What sets the Mass Effect™ series apart is its exceptional storytelling and player agency, and the Legendary Edition accentuates these qualities. The narrative depth and emotional impact of the original trilogy remain intact, allowing players to forge meaningful connections with the diverse cast of characters. The updated character creator offers more options to customize your Shepard, ensuring that your protagonist feels truly unique. The improved dialogue systems allow for deeper conversations and interactions, allowing players to shape their Shepard's personality and relationships with other characters.

The remastered edition maintains the series' core essence by granting players agency through impactful decision-making. The consequences of your choices reverberate throughout the trilogy, adding depth and replayability. Whether it's deciding the fate of civilizations or making personal sacrifices, your actions shape the galaxy and immerse you in a morally complex and emotionally charged narrative.

Romance options have always been a cherished component of the Mass Effect™ series, and the Legendary Edition enhances this aspect. With refined dialogue and expanded romance scenes, players can form deep connections with a diverse cast of characters. The remaster brings forth intimate moments and character development, allowing for authentic relationships that transcend the digital realm. The inclusion of a wider range of romantic possibilities adds depth and inclusivity to the storytelling, ensuring that everyone can find a romance that resonates with them.


The Mass Effect™ universe has always been rich with lore, and the Legendary Edition dives even deeper into this vast galaxy. From the extensive codex entries to the beautifully redesigned planetary descriptions, every corner of the galaxy feels more alive and interconnected. The additional DLC content and promotional items from the original games are seamlessly integrated, expanding the universe even further. Exploring the hidden histories and conflicts of the various alien races has never been more satisfying.

The remastered audio design and music of the Legendary Edition are awe-inspiring. The enhanced sound effects, from the satisfying blast of weapons to the ambient noises of bustling cities, contribute to a heightened sense of immersion. The renowned musical score, composed by Jack Wall and Sam Hulick, remains as iconic as ever, tugging at the heartstrings and amplifying the emotional weight of key moments. The Legendary Edition's audio experience is a symphony that perfectly complements the visuals and gameplay.

BioWare's commitment to technical improvements in the Legendary Edition is commendable. The loading times have been significantly reduced, ensuring a smoother and more seamless experience. The stability of the games has also been improved, minimizing crashes and glitches. The inclusion of quality of life improvements, such as a unified inventory system and improved Galaxy Map navigation, further streamlines the overall gameplay experience.",1689347780,1689347780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
1. Remastered textures--> Makes the game more Realistic/Immersive 
2. Amazing Story--> Emotional/Thrilling/Re-playable 
3. All 3 Original Games Into One Single Game-->Saves money 
4. Open World Story--> A lot of mysteries to discover/Makes you create the story of the game
5. Meeting Garrus at the bar( For those who don't know this character, the only thing I can say is that if you play this game you'll love him) 
5. Solid Combat System--> Still keeps up to date

Cons: 
1. Not a Huge Remaster--> Some scenes look identical as the original/Advanced lighting is lacking(Can be fixed through mods though) 
2. EA launcher required--> If you press play on Steam it has to open the EA launcher and then opens Mass Effect
3. Controversial Ending in Mass Effect 3--> There are 4 ending(color) options in the end but they're all the same in the end and it seems like Bioware didn't put a lot of effort into making a good ending in Mass Effect 3. 

Conclusion: Despite the lack of visual improvements and controversial ending Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is still one of the best RPG games out there. With an Outstanding Storyline(except for the ending) and a Open World Universe packed with many missions, Mass Effect is an Awesome Game if you're looking for an Emotional/Thrilling/Re-playable game.",1689330312,1689330312,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ah. Mass Effect...
Words can not even begin to describe how much these games mean to me. I will be revisiting these games many many times before my own time is up. 

I remember being gifted the first game and thinking I would probably drop it within the first few hours. Boy, was I wrong. I binge played this game and completed it many different times before the 2nd game came out. 

Although some of the elements in the first game were very boring and tedious, [spoiler] aka; The Mako Missions [/spoiler], I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters and the story. Revisiting the excitement of meeting old friends and companions (mainly Wrex and Garrus) will be a feeling I can never get over. 

If you can push through the old mechanics of the first game, you're in for an emotional ride and memorable experience. 

If you haven't played it yet, JUST PLAY IT. Trust me. It's worth it. It's my favourite game series and I can't recommend it enough. 

[i] PS. If the ending of the trilogy doesn't satisfy you like it doesn't for many others, I highly recommend Youtubing the 'Indoctrination Theory'. Whether it is true or not, it's something that adds to the experience and makes a lot of things make more sense. [/i]

As for the games:
ME1 was nice but there were some real bad balance issues with a few fights that made some fights hurt.

ME2 did just about everything right, made all the necessary improvements. Combat was a lot better. Characters too.
8.5/10

ME3 basically the same as 2. Combat was a little worse at first with that whole weight thing but you get used to it. Shopping is nice. War assets fun. You get a limited amount of squad mates though. One or two fights were beyond unbalanced. Wish the trilogy had a more definitive ending: a canon ending that's less bleak. Getting locked out of quests is no fun.

I've played it since 2010., when I first played Mass Effect 1, then I played 2 and 3 as they were released. Finally, I bought Legendary Edition and the changes they've made, while impressive, have broken few things but I will get into this soon.

All three games have good and bad sides. Mass Effect 1 is amazing in its storytelling. We get Saren, who is among the most interesting villains I've seen in videogames. He does not believe he's evil, rather, he believes ends justify the means. Still, the matter of opinion regarding his morality is left to player. Do you believe Saren was ruthless and only wanted power? Or do you believe he's brainwashed by the Reapers? Game allows you to choose, and ultimately in the end, the game is about Shepard you're roleplaying, not about predetermined setting which, while there, only serves as a frame for your own choices. Of all three games, ME1 is shortest, and this is where the gripe I have with the game comes in.
If you're the completionist like me, you'll want to finish every sidequest before the game ends. Alas, most sidequests in this game require you to travel around whole galaxy, landing on planets, endlessly climbing rocks in the clunkiest vehicle of all time: Mako. While some quests on these planets are interesting, most of the time you'll be frustrated because none of these planets are ultimately original or interesting. I experienced frustrating bugs and glitches, like Shepard's hands staying in weapon-holding pose even after I sheathe the weapon, or glitching through the ground, as well as freezes and crashes and abysmal FPS drops while exploring planets with Mako. Still, game is great. It has this old-school feeling, amazing soundtrack, no pandering to any groups or ethnicity. It goes as far as to involve a racist character: something that would never fly nowadays, but gives your crew a much needed difference of opinions and realism. 

Mass Effect 2 is, in my opinion, best of all three games. Unlike ME1, in 2 you didn't have thousand different armors and weapons. Decluttering of inventory allows player to focus on raising their abilities and skills, and moves focus from micromanagement to action.  This creates a fast-paced, interesting game where the action actually feels alive. Graphics are improvement over ME1, textures are vastly better, and the game reaches the another level of maturity. 
Story is interesting, to say the least. Without many spoilers, a huge event takes places right at the beginning of the game. This immediately gets you hooked, and the game is so interesting you really can't stop playing once you start. There are not many things I could really write off as bad about this game. I'm one of rare people who applaud devs for not making Jack lesbian pansexual. She's one of the most interesting characters in the game, and pandering would have destroyed her personality and character. The only thing I could count as bad is the planet scanning system.
My wrist would literally hurt from all the slow scrolling around planet to find a miniscule amount of minerals I needed to upgrade my weapons and armor. In the end, I downloaded the mod to take all minerals from the planet with a single probe, and it was a life saver. Without mods, this is the only gripe I have with this game. That, and the fact so many of these upgrades are easily missed, yet absolutely necessary (because the game gets harder and harder as you go). In the end I played every major mission with the phone in my lap, desperately checking for upgrade locations so I don't miss out on any.

Now, ME3 was mired in controversy and I understand why. The game, when you play it, sounds like a masterpiece. Music is amazing, sound is great, graphics are major step-up from first two games. Soundtrack serves to set up a setting in a way that gives you goosebumps anytime something major happens. Every moment of this game is emotional. It's somber tone is further accentuated by the fact everything in the game reminds you the end is near. Every person you meet has a sad story, every fugitive you see lost somebody important, and even Shepard suffers from nightmares. 
This is not the controversial part. I could go on about the fact game introduced two openly gay characters, finally buckling down under the heel of propaganda, but Cortez and Traynor are amazingly well written characters I really liked, and neither this is a bad part. Controversial part is an ending. After all the game, everything you do boils down to three choices. Unlike some Bioware's games where ending was so multi-faceted you could play game for ten years and still see different outcomes when you finish, this game will finish the same no matter what you do. After a huge backlash from fans, Bioware expanded these endings but the damage was already done. Personally, I don't mind these endings. To me, it was always more about the road I've taken to get to the end, than the ending itself, but it's objectively one thing I could count as bad.

Ultimately, all three games are masterpieces, and Mass Effect is one of my favorite franchises.

So, why buy this? Some complain that mods can achieve better graphics for free, and that is possibly true. The real selling point however, is the convenience to access all three games in an updated state with one download. All the additional content was integrated to the story in a much more organic way than it used to be: you are no longer bombarded with messages at the start of ME2 notifying you that some dude sent you his experimental weapon, instead you'll find it like you would any other piece of gear playing the game. No longer having to download all the DLCs from ME2 from another website is also a plus.

You get my point: the Legendary Edition is not just a graphics improvement, it is a thorough polishing of the experience as a whole, something that would help old fans and newcomers alike to (re)experience Mass Effect as easily as possible.As far as I'm concerned, it worked.

Mass Effect one benefits greatly from the remaster. Big quality of life improvements and a smoothening of the gameplay really help ME 1 age better. You can now skip elevator load sequences if you don't wan't to hear the NPC squadmates talking. The graphics overhaul looks great. They improved combat in ME 1 and made it closer to ME 2. The equipment menu got a nice overhaul as well and is much easier to manage. The hacking and salvaging minigame has been changed as well to a circular puzzle that is a little more compelling than blinking controller buttons. Still not hard though.

  Overall if you have never played the Mass Effect games you need to get this edition. Vanilla ME 1 requires some heavy nostalgia goggles to go back and play in this day and age and this series improves the overall experience of ME 1. New players are more likely to finish the first game now and get to enjoy the more polished ME 2 and ME 3 sequels that really shine.

First one really surprised me because i thought it was a old game and it would be small but yeah i was so wrong. First you have all the uniqe races and it was really fun finding stuff about them. Characters are good too as story. Combat does gets boring over time because you are going to do the same thing for 30 hours because there is not much to do shoot cover shoot cover again.

After first one second game was even better. Graphics, weapons and abilities was a good thouch to the game. 3 more race was added i think but it was getting even more boring to the end because of the combat again and some parts made me so mad because of hard difficulty.

I don't know much about third game because I'm waiting some time to continue playing. Don't want to drown myself because it's not much different then other 2 games. No new abilities, weapons don't feels different, story is still the same and for the third time I need to go find Tali and recruit her.

A three game, 150+ hour journey spread out over 5 years of releases isn’t easy to talk about in a succinct fashion. But I loved it, so I have to talk about it. This Trilogy now holds a special place in my heart. I’m a huge sci-fi fan, and Mass Effect delivers an engaging world with inventive alien, ship, and tech designs that rival Star Trek’s. 

The choices that follow you through the Trilogy are impactful and unrivaled in today’s gaming landscape. The amount of branching story honestly makes my head spin at times, but also makes the journey that much more personal. So much of the writing across these games feels tailored to your character, with entire scenarios playing out differently if you’re a female Commander. My Commander Shepard was Female, mostly Renegade, Infiltrator class, no romance, and Insanity difficulty, and my experience of the series is colored by that fact. The voice actor Jennifer Hale is a big reason why I enjoyed these games so much, and I’m not sure if male Shepard’s voice actor delivers the same performance. 

[h1]Legendary Edition[/h1]

First off, the collection itself is the perfect way to experience this Trilogy. I played entirely on Steam Deck, so I had some problems that were mostly Origin’s fault. There were some occasional failures to launch, and achievements in ME2 and ME3 just don’t work. Besides these minor hiccups, Legendary Edition runs great, looks great, and has a bunch of minor improvements (like photo mode) that I didn’t notice because this is my first experience with the Trilogy. The transitions between titles were extremely smooth as a result. 

[h1]Mass Effect 1[/h1]

Mass Effect 1 is, without a doubt, the roughest of the trilogy. It has frustrating level scaling (which Legendary Edition attempts to fix), very dry gunplay, and lots of filler missions. There are some pretty bad autosaves that almost bricked my save, and some awkward animations that took me out of the moment. Abilities are also pretty weak when compared to the power of guns. To its credit, though, it has fantastic world building, impressive visuals, solid voice acting, good characterization of your companions/crew, and some really solid morality choices that echo across the Trilogy. I disliked some of the Renegade characterization, but most of it felt really cohesive, building up Shepard as a hard-ass soldier who does whatever it takes to get the job done, while not being completely unsympathetic and emotionless. The RPG aspects are definitely the worst of the series and more complex than they're worth.

[h1]Mass Effect 2[/h1] 

Mass Effect 2 is improved in all aspects. Better gunplay, better abilities, more meaningful side content, better animations, stronger story, and a more in-depth look at the galaxy. Mass Effect 2 has the largest cast of the Trilogy, with a nice mix of returning and new characters. Each individual crew member has a strong story with convincing characterization, and the crew regularly interacts with each other, their environment, and scenarios. Player choices from Mass Effect 1 have pretty big effects on the state of the galaxy, and lots of references to the smaller choices are sprinkled throughout. The Renegade characterization in this game is my favorite of the series, elevating Shepard to something more than just “evil”. I particularly liked Shepard’s appearance changes as she became more and more Renegade/Paragon. There are some rough spots, though. The “Suicide Mission” is forced on you early if you don’t metagame and lookup the story progression, potentially locking you out of content. Fortunately, you can continue playing in the post-game, finishing up any companion missions you missed (or collecting some model ships for your cabin). The game features a resource gathering minigame where you shoot probes at planets. It gets old fast, but you have to complete it to get you, your ship, and your crew upgraded. Ammo scarcity is also a problem throughout the game. Bioware was clearly adjusting to level designing with ammo in mind, and slightly missed the mark on a few missions. The skill system is streamlined, and while you lose a bit of player choice, it comes with the benefit of a much more focused set of player abilities. 

The DLC for Mass Effect 2 is hit or miss. Firewalker introduces a new vehicle, but the novelty wears off after the first of five new missions. Normandy Crash Site is a single mission that involved walking around a lot. Overlord presented some interesting morality decisions. Genesis provides a nice summary of ME1’s exploits in comic-book form, courtesy of Dark Horse Comics. Kasumi and Zaeed both add companions, of which Zaeed is the stronger addition. Kasumi’s heist mission is boring and FemShep’s dress is too uncanny looking. Zaeed’s missions tell a lot about the character and give some good morality choices. Arrival does setup for Mass Effect 3, best played [i]after[/i] the Suicide Mission. Lair of the Shadow Broker is the best of the bunch, with a solid action-packed mission that gives Liara the much-needed spotlight and creates implications for Mass Effect 3. 

Full warning, I couldn’t review the third entry without spoiling aspects of Mass Effect 2. So don’t read below this point if you care about that. 

[h1]Mass Effect 3[/h1]

Mass Effect 3 takes a somber shift from ME2’s 90’s heist movie feel. The galaxy is now in a full-blown war with the Reapers, and the tone of the game reflects that. Things are serious, and Earth needs the galaxy’s support. The main improvements to ME3 are in the mission design, economy, and combat balance. Powers are significantly stronger than ME2, dealing more damage and having faster cooldowns. Ammo-placement, credit-balance, shops, weapon choices, mods, and ability choices are all much improved as well. I did have some problems with getting Kasumi’s companion mission to properly progress and had to resort to using a save-editor.

Things shift on the Normandy and in the galaxy as a whole as the battle with the Reapers rages on; crew members appear in various places, people talk, diplomats come and go. Your crew is smaller, but each character gets more attention as a result. The crew interacts constantly, and the interactivity present in ME2 is turned up to 11. The amount of voicework for all these diverging conversations is insane. There’s meaningful impact from the previous games, with constant references to past player decisions. The new “War Assets” you can acquire are the culmination of your journey through the galaxy. 

The DLC for Mass Effect 3 is mostly great. From Ashes adds in Javik and his missions, which are integrated so well into the main game I didn’t even know they were DLC until writing this review. The Extended Cut refines the ending, which I thoroughly enjoyed. There’s a lot of negative critique surrounding ME3’s ending, but I was really satisfied with how my [spoiler]Synthesis[/spoiler] ending turned out, which is due in part to this DLC. Leviathan adds several missions that expand on Mass Effect’s lore in really exciting ways. Omega puts you in cahoots with Aria T’Loak and another new companion for some pure shoot-em-up action  while taking back Omega. Aria in action is pure bad-assery. Citadel is a fan-favorite, but I actually hated it. It has a very lighthearted tone, with characters constantly making quips in what is essentially one giant fan-service send-off of Shepard and the crew. The tone is completely at odds with the rest of the game, so I’d recommend skipping it until you’ve beaten the game (you’ll have a chance to go do it after you’re done with the final mission).

[h1]Final Remarks[/h1]

I’m a bit sad to say goodbye to the Mass Effect universe. There’s so much to love about its world and characters that I could spend hours more than I already have writing about it. Here’s to a bygone era of storytelling, and I hope many more enjoy it as much as I have.",1688706135,1688706872,True,1,0,0.514619886875152588,1,True,False,False

My love for this game cannot be described. Starting off on X-Box 360 I fell in love, playing the 3rd game first lmao. 
Choosing your background actually comes into play for the story as people will view Shep differently based on if you're a war hero or ruthless, spacer or colonist, if you're adept or a solider, etc. In ME1 you also get background specific quests as well. I like for a spacer mumma Shep in ME1 is a well known Executive Officer (Admiral ME2 / Rear Admiral ME3) in the Alliance and makes a few appearances through email or interviews.
So I would recommend trying out a few different paths in different playthroughs. 
Also want to add that renegade Shep is such a d*ck lol, so if you want to play as a ren Shep I'd say be a ruthless war hero.
The Legendary Edition is such an improvement from the original games, ME1 is more enjoyable with the change in UI and the HUD. As well as having all the DLCs (apart from Pinnical Station for ME1 thanks to the DLC file being corrupted so the devs couldn't add it), the graphics getting some love and for $100 NZD (when not on sale) is just amazing, I can't explain how much money I spent originally on PS3 for all of them. It is extremely worth the price.
Trust me when I say you will enjoy the Citadel DLC in ME3. It grabs you away from the war and puts you in an amazing side story filled with a decent plot twist ending, inside ME jokes, jokes in general, heartwarming moments, extra scenes for romanced characters, closer for a character (not going to spoil it), one night stand with the amazing James Vega ;) and guns, many guns. OH and having to press the mouse button 183 fricken times taking around 15 minutes to beat Vega's pull up record, no it doesn't actually affect your rep even though it gives prompts. You can tell the team put a lot of work into this DLC, there is so much love in this DLC. Yes it is short if you race through, but it's one where once you finish the story line it doesn't kick you out. You can go back to Anderson's I mean your apartment at any point, expect from when you go to Cerberus HQ (which is basically no return).
Down side is that for ME3 they got rid of the Multiplayer aspect to it, I enjoyed it on PS3 but I'm glad they got rid of it based on the amount of people that hated that it was a compulsory thing if you wanted the best war score and HAD to play it so the score wouldn't go down. But otherwise no other complaints.
If you love Sci-Fi RPGs where putting in effort with side content actually matters, then you'll love this game. 100% the game takes about 120ish hours to complete so you won't be short on content.

[b] Pros: [/b]
- Amazing main storyline
- Great cast of characters
- Strong writing
- Incredibly engaging worldbuilding
- Decent RPG mechanics and progression
- Pretty good soundtrack

[b] Cons: [/b]
- Very lackluster combat that doesn't feel very good
- Tedious hacking minigame
- Tedious collectahon side quests
- Incredibly dull level design. Very repetitive, often baren and copy + paste
- Too many interiors look like obvious combat arenas which feel out of place and breaks immersion
- Lackluster exploration and Mako (vehicle) gameplay feels very sloppy and sluggish
- Paragon and Renegade system feels a bit restrictive, in that it rewards you for sticking to one throughout an entire playthrough, limiting player freedom

[b] Final Verdict [/b]
- A solid 8/10 game. Great introduction to the Mass Effect universe and some of its central themes and characters.

[h1] Mass Effect 2 [/h1]

[b] Pros: [/b]
- Incredibly compelling characters and character storylines
- Some of the best writing in any RPG ever
- Highly improved combat compared to ME1. Actually feels good to play now
- One of the best if not THE BEST final mission/level in any roleplaying game ever made
- Companions Companions Companions
- Fleshed out worldbuilding, with more variety in aliens, politics, religion, philosophy, art, world design and locations
- Incredible soundtrack with many memorable tracks as well as returning favorites from ME1
- Actual consequences for a variety of your decisions throughout the game
- Paragon and Renegade conversation interupts are a great addition that keeps conversations engaging and interactive

[b] Cons: [/b]
- Next to no exploration this time around. Limited to exploring hub zones
- Streamlined ability trees and progression which makes balancing easier but limits the amount of choice and variety
- Paragon and Renegade system suffers from the same problems as in ME1
- The new hacking minigames offer some variety from ME1, however they quickly turn just as tedious and boring
- Weapon restrictions on classes once again limits player choice
- Probing planets for essential resources is one of the most dull and mind numbing activities in the entire trilogy

[b] Final Verdict [/b]
- An easy 9.5/10. One of the best RPGs ever made and a huge improvement on almost all aspects over ME1. Some elements like exploration and deeper gear/character progression being scrapped doesn't hurt the overall experience, but it does limit the game's actual potential of hitting a 10/10.

[h1] Mass Effect 3 [/h1]

[b] Pros: [/b]
- The best combat gameplay in the trilogy. Feels incredibly smooth and fun to play
- Lots of weapons, abilities and builds to experiment with. Easily the best in the trilogy
- Has some of best story moments in the entire trilogy. Ironically also has some of the lowest
- Is able to reap what has been sowed in the previous two games for MASSIVE benefits
- Relationships, character bonding and moments are as strong as they have ever been
- Paragon and Renegade system has finally been fixed, with both styles contributing to one reputation bar that will unlock more dialogue options for both styles instead of forcing you to stick with only one
- Characters move around the Normandy in-between missions which opens up for a huge variety of character interactions. Unfortunately, they are also easily missable
- Comes with a new map for tracking companions, important NPCs and the like
- The Shoreleave Citadel content is some of the funniest stuff I have ever played. Pure fanservice, but done in an intelligent and respectable manner that doesn't take away from the core experience
- Once again an amazing soundtrack that sounds quite different than the music in the previous two games, however it fits just as well because of the circumstances

[b] Cons: [/b]
- The removal of the neutral dialogue option is a baffling choice that severely hurts dialogue
- Again almost no exploration whatsoever
- Kai Leng
- The story gets quite convoluted with some its explanations towards the end and things become hard to believe
- The ""nightmare"" sequences that Shepard has feel forced because of what they focus on. Had they focused on prior decisions made in the previous games, they would have been more effective and dynamic
- War Assets are unfortunately not as impactful as upgrades and squad loyalty were in ME2 and ultimately only boils down to what endings are available rather than a plethora of different outcomes and scenes/interactions
- The ending itself can feel very contrived and ultimately not at all satisfactory regardless of the Galaxy or Shepard's fate

[b] Final Verdict [/b]
- Still a solid 9/10 game. The game does fall flat on its face here and there, but with the improvements to the gameplay, the character interactions while also having some of the best moments in the entire trilogy still makes this a worthwhile game to play through.",1688499358,1688499772,True,108,2,0.850533366203308105,0,True,False,False

Is Mass Effect Legendary Edition a fun game? Yes it is... It is chopped full of story, fun combat, and lots of RPG fun... Choices do make a difference most of the time, which includes flavor choices regarding how you decide to portray your Commander Sheppard... Now, that being said, I want to warn you, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is technically a slightly updated, and slightly altered version of the original Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3 games, using the same loader for all three titles, and allowing your character to more easily transfer from one title to the other... It also includes all prior DLC Content for all three titles... Be warned, possible SPOILERS ahead...

When it comes to graphics, they will differ from one title to another, as the game sequence plays out... The graphics of these older titles were not really updated much, if at all... That means ME1 will look more dated then ME2, which in turn both of them will look more dated then ME3's graphics... The UI's will also not entirely be the same from one game to the other, even though they look and feel decent... It will just take some getting used to, as you go from one to the other... That being said, I had no real issue with the graphics... The UI does improve as things progress from ME1 to ME2 and eventually to ME3... Please note, there are Mods you can install for all 3 that improve some graphics aspects... Such as: Using ME3 faces/heads for some of the companions that are in ME1 and ME2 as well (for more consistency), or higher resolution video sequences, more hair cuts, and the list goes on... But modding the game can be a bit tricky, even more so when it comes to some graphics based modded updates, so be forewarned...

Game play is fun... Combat is played in a cover based form of First Person Shooter (FPS)... You use a mix of ranged weapons along with various types of abilities/skills... As your character gains levels, they gain points to spend towards improving abilities/skills, along with passive improvements... Although the progression system is not entirely the same from one game to the other, it is easy enough to understand and use... This allows for you to play your character how you want to, with the only restriction being your chosen character class/skill set... You can change your class, each time, from game to game as you progress from ME1 into ME2 and then eventually into ME3... Or you can leave it the same (points spent on progression from one title to the other do not move over as each game does have a slightly unique take on each class)... Even your characters visuals can either be moved over, or you can completely alter them... Key Choices are imported into the next title as you progress as well... Technically, you can start completely from scratch in each title as well, if you so choose...

Story/Dialogue is well done and chopped full of meaningful choices as well as flavor choices... The game uses a Dialogue Wheel which follows a particular pattern of investigation and responses... Depending on responses you choose, you can be nice or be mean or take the middle ground... And in some cases, you may also be presented with story altering choices (typically colored blue or red), similarly flavored, that build up different scores... And depending on those scores, sometimes the story will be altered later on... And most choices are remembered, regardless, especially when it comes to your characters Companions...

Companions make up your characters team, and not only do they help in combat, but they each can be influenced by your decisions, regardless if it has to do with their individual Story Lines or the Main Story Line... Some companions can be romanced (usually depending on your chosen sex - not all are heterosexual) and/or even be killed, all depending on your choices as you play each game... Not all companions follow you through all 3 games, but many do, sometimes depending on prior choices (i.e. they died, etc)... You can also spend points on companions skills/abilities or just let them auto-level, your choice... You can even equip them, depending on their class...

As far as story progression goes, here is the tricky part... Each Mass Effect game has both Main and Side stories/missions you can go through, along side some exploring, and resource gathering (yes, there is crafting)... Not all side missions are necessary for the main story to progress, but you would be missing out on some fun content (especially companion missions which can be pivotal to either their survival or how the story works out at the end of each game, so be warned)... There comes a time in all three titles, where you get to a mission or series of missions which are points of no return... Which can, depending on the title, keep you from going back and completing some side content prior to those points... You could wing it, or as I suggest, go look up a Mission Progression Guide for each game in order to save you the heart ache of missing out of some fun content... Or just wing it, and see how things turn out... This series of games easily allows for multiple playthrough's, making different decisions... Replay ability is a key bonus of this series of games...

Music and Sound in this game is good... Every character and dialogue is voiced over, and there is lots of ambient sounds and conversations going on as you play... Companions will sporadically have conversations, NPC's will talk to you as you walk by sometimes, with evolving dialogue... And the list goes on...

Overall, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is an awesome RPG experience, that I wish more Story Rich RPG's would aspire to... The game is a blast either modded or un-modded (even though I think it was an even richer experience modded - depending on the mods selected)... You could purchase the original ME1, ME2, and ME3 games but I think there is enough fixes and what not to make purchasing the Legendary Edition worth paying for instead... Would I pay full price? Sure, even though I bought it on-sale...

P.S. - This version of the game takes up a lot of drive space, much more so if you decide to go with certain mods, so take that into account when deciding where to install the game...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Venture into the unknown. I've heard wonderful things about the Mass Effect Trilogy, so I tried it out. The trilogy is amazing, especially if you're a fan of sci-fi games. There's a ton of content between the three games to last you a while. Although it starts slow, it picks up quickly and is always entertaining. Decisions you don't think twice about may come back to haunt or reward you in the later games, which, in my opinion, only enhances the experience.

As for the gameplay, it starts rough, but it's important to keep in mind that these games are somewhat old now. Plus, it gets better throughout the trilogy, and it's nice to see the improvements as you move from game to game. The biggest con is the organization of every game. Most of the gameplay aspects improve with every game, but the organization (map, quests/skills menu) is an aspect that I thought was always clunky and hard to work with. The difficulty of the trilogies organization made doing side quests confusing to do at times. Yet, although it was frustrating at times, the gameplay and story were entertaining, so I didn't mind.

Overall, if you're into sci-fi RPGs, I wholeheartedly recommend this game, especially if you can get it for sale at the price of $15 (that's what I paid). There may be some clutter with each game, but in the end, they're great experiences that I believe everyone can enjoy.",1688424701,1688425036,True,2,0,0.529147982597351074,0,True,False,False

Oh christ, another 10 minutes in and I realize the mouse sensitivity is also tied to the framerate. If you enter a graphically intensive room, the camera view starts cranking 90's at mach 10. So I guess lower framerate = higher mouse sensitivity.

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Lemon drizzle cake recipe you've come to the right place,,,

{ ingredients }

225g unsalted butter, softened
225g caster sugar
4 eggs
225g self-raising flour
1 lemon, zested

For the drizzle topping
1½ lemons, juiced
85g caster sugar

{ directions }

STEP 1
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4

STEP 2
Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through

STEP 3
Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined

STEP 4
Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon

STEP 5
Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean

STEP 6
While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemon juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle

STEP 7
Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle – the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping

STEP 8
Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month",1688313424,1688313424,True,1,2,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

Highly recommended for anyone, this is one game you must play. Just like everyone should watch The Godfather. 

As for the remaster itself, Mass Effect 1 is done very well and you can see that this is the direction in which the rest of EA's older games will probably go, there is already an announced remaster of Dragon Age 1. 
However, when it comes to the rest of the games in the Mass Effect remaster series, I would say that their quality is at an average level. Developers themselves have confirmed that the remaster of the second and third part was done through AI upscaling, and unfortunately it can be seen, because at this point the first ME looks the best of the entire trilogy.

In this case, I recommend using mods that can be found on NexusMods and installing the one you are interested in. I mainly recommend those for better quality textures and cutscenes.",1688235610,1688235610,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It runs mostly without issues and never crashed for me. The music, gameplay, and story are so impressive, especially since this came out in 2007. It is the definitive sci-fi RPG of all time.

Mass Effect 2 is also an incredible sci-fi space epic! It improves upon everything and just about nails it in every department. It does simplify some of the RPG mechanics from the first game such as the loot and inventory management, but those features were more or less filler (although I liked them.) The second entry in the series feels like it focuses heavily on the characters and friends you meet along the way, but the story is still as strong as ever. The ending of this game is some of the most high stakes, emotional, and intense storytelling I've experienced in a video game. Such a fantastic funking game and it's one that you can reply many times.

Mass Effect 3 was really fun and had many gut punch moments. The music is the peak of the series as is the gameplay and graphics. Many of the DLC is great too. The story has its great moments and the final mission is so intense and crazy. But damn the writing is dog water sometimes. Absolutely dog water. I am not sure what to say about the ending. I not only need time to think about it but its safe to say it is imperfect. Very odd. To a certain extent I'd say it's unsatisfying. God D*****

Mass Effect 2,  Hacking , bypass, Squad mates and final mission is great, not a single thing I didn't like.  10/10

BioWare has given us what is among the most beloved game trilogies of all time. All EA cares about is getting their greasy horrible alien hands on everyone else's money. 

I bought Legendary Edition cause I loved the originals on Xbox. When the game wouldn't launch due to EA's annoying mandatory game launcher, I opened a help ticket with EA, as suggested by Steam. All they did was wave their horrible EA hands at me saying they don't care about people just money. Their exact response was ""Fix not available"". So yeah, screw EA. It really sucks they bought BioWare. 

Btw, I found the solution to launching the game on Steam. You have to agree to pair your Steam account with EA's game launcher or else their launcher won't recognize your ownership of the game. Enter corporate excuse here for why they make it mandatory to pair your account. Its obvious they want to mine your personal data so they can sell it to the highest bidder...because...to EA all we are is $$. 

If I could give BioWare 5 out of 5 stars I would but because EA is part of this, I vote 0. Company is only as strong as its weakest link and in all departments EA is a 0. Ok to be fair, they are really quite good at being soul-less corporate cogs and profit-mongers.

Unfortunately, this IS an EA game... so they force you to install the EA App which does two things, i) break the Steam achievements and ii) randomly delete your game saves - and note that as of 2Q 2023, two YEARS post launch, EA is not willing to fix any of this.

Unless you know how to hack away this EA App, don't buy this game. It's not worth it.

DO NOT BUY

-----

Graphics are a bit improved, usually for the better.
Audio is as good as before.
Content-wise, some of the DLC for the previous games... were left out (they lost the code. Yes really) - and subsequently some features were removed. i.e. the Complete experience is you playing the previous three games with all the DLCs... NOT THIS ""LEGENDARY"" game

In addition some of the gameplay mechanics were tweaked in ME1 to align with ME2/3. Very minor changes that you'd notice if you played the earlier versions

They revamped the levelling experience so you'd be able to max out your level in a single playthrough in each game.

Those new to the game series or those used to Bioware's newer games will be pleasantly surprised at the story-focused narratives of the games. You might also see some differences in production values from a decade of EA/Bioware management.

-----
Now the main reason why you shouldn't spend a cent on this game unless you a tech-savvy, very patient and want to experience a Bioware game from when Bioware meant quality.

This game initially shipped with EA's Origin store/game launcher, then updated to the EA App. This means two things, namely you are again, saddled with an unwanted, unneeded, useless launcher and... it's so incompetently done that it breaks the game.

e.g EA App prevents achievements in ME2 and ME3. Nevermind the Steam achievements but certain gameplay mechanics like skills / abilities are tied to the achievements. Yes really.

The 'official' (it's in the official EA forums / FAQ) fix is to uninstall EA App and put on an older version of Origin. But no worries,  EA has continuously updated their software to fix this... no wait, they updated their software NOT to fix the game but to PREVENT customers from using this fix. Right now, late June 2023 (right after EA patched this... again) if you use EA App, the game will probably prevent some or all achievements in ME2/3, if you use the older Origin... the STEAM achievements work... but the in-game ones (that affect gameplay) won't work

(Any technical aspect of this review for the legendary edition is going to be only about Mass Effect 2 and 3 on Steam Deck, as I played Mass Effect 1 in its original 2007 version. Otherwise, the review would mostly concern the trilogy as a whole. Will try to avoid spoilers as much as possible.)

Having just finished Mass Effect 3, I can honestly say that this series has been nothing short of a ""rollercoaster of emotions"". I laughed out loud way too many times, teared up on multiple occasions, felt plenty of goosebumps, and in general cared for the characters (and the world) more than I probably care about some real-life people. 

And let me tell you about the characters. I think the characters in this game, particularly the squad mates, are one of, if not the best, I've seen in any game. And boy do they develop throughout the trilogy! They have the best lines, and are extremely well-written; consistently so throughout all 3 games. You will have terrific teammates in ME1, then the roster expands into a bigger ensemble in 2, with 3 playing around with your feelings (mostly in good ways) by shaking things up a bit.

The story also has very high quality writing backing it. As a whole the premise is simple: you are the commander of a spaceship and it's your job to build up your crew and take down some galactic baddies. But the development of the individual plots in each game and the weaving of the bigger narrative of the series is filled with many nuances and twists, whilealso being paced with care. I was engaged the whole time, from the beginning moments of the first game to the end credits of the last, while also thinking about the games in-between sessions. 

Even though I ""played"" the last 2 games collectively for about 99 hours, the gameplay is my least favorite aspect of the series. Though to be fair, this is coming from someone who doesn't much care for shooter games. I'm pretty sure I would've been annoyed at all the shooting if it was any other game; instead I was only midly frustrated and mostly entertained. In terms of individual games, I think ME1 had too much weapon customizations for my taste, with 2 hitting a sweet spot, while 3 makes some quality of life changes along with bringing back some of the customizations from 1.

I also really liked the music in the trilogy, which keeps getting better with each sequel. ME1 is mostly electronic but also has some emotional tracks, whereas 2 and 3's music is more orchestral and bombastic. The songs toward the end are especially hard-hitting, for obvious reasons, with a certain final mission theme being a certified banger.

As for the technical stuff, I played on my Steam Deck through both ME2 and ME3 with little issues. I came across a negligible amount of visual glitches of the funny variety here and there but the games are otherwise solid with consistent performance. The only thing that did occasionally test my patience is the EA app, which would crash at game startup from time to time. I was able to get past that by backing up my save files, clearing the proton files on Steam Deck, then restarting the game. Oh, and, the game does indeed require that you're online the whole time you're playing. Also, the achievements don't work for ME2 and ME3 apparently, but it was a non-issue for me as I don't really care for achievements.

In summary, I believe this trilogy is such a fine example of video games as art forms that I can't help but wish that everyone would get to experience it. So much emotion and humor is richly mixed so that the Mass Effect games now will be one of my favorites of all time.

The visual design and gameplay of the games, especially Mass Effect 1 and 2, is significantly enhanced but not fundamentally altered; the original BioWare vision was clearly a priority for this development team. I believe some from the original team even worked on MELE. On the tech enthusiast side of things, check out the ""Visual Improvements"" and ""Gameplay Calibrations"" articles on EA.com. Those articles will explain the details and nature of the actual remastering far better than I could here. 

On the gamer side of things, the reason I bought this title two years post-release is because manually modding the first two games and sacrificing content/save integration and some visual quality just got too much to deal with. BDtS and MEUITM 2021 were enough to get me from 2016-2019, but when I set it back up this year things had clearly changed for the worse. The ALOT mod (which includes MEUITM, MERLIN, Improved Static Lighting, ALOV, and options in each for HD/4K resolutions). is a comparable community remaster to the official BioWare/EA remaster - the installer is easy enough to manage, but there's a lot of things to be aware of and do correctly. And it still doesn't solve the content/save integration problem (namely, DLCs and save imports). 

So, I bought MELE and loved every minute of playing through Mass Effect 1-2. They did a phenomenal job on all fronts, included every DLC from each game except Pinnacle Station (I think the source code was corrupted?), and created a unified launcher for the trilogy. Cannot recommend enough, and know that MELE is on par with other remastered titles, such as Halo CEA, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, Fable Anniversary, and StarCraft Remastered. Play it, love it, and mourn the ending to Mass Effect 3. 

Edit: there is one change I noticed that has not been mentioned anywhere: in the first cutscene of ME2, Miranda originally said ""Shepard did everything right - saving the Citadel, even saving the Council"" (depending on choices). Now, that part is simply excluded and the Illusive Man's response is altered. It's very odd and jarring, but everything else remains unchanged. Parts of Omega and the Collector Ship mission suffer from over-saturated black colors on-screen as well, sometimes with mild flickering.",1686629983,1687724114,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics seemed to have been more optimised towards movement of the characters you play and less about the NPC's around. I have noticed that the vehicles like the Mako and the Hammerhead have less glitches when it comes to turning, but there are times when you can flip them upside down and it takes a while for them to flip over. Minor bug bear there.
Still, I am enjoying the fact the minor issues are gone now. Scanning and firing probes is a lot quicker than on console. Also, I can entirely skip the romance in ME1 without consequences to ME2 and 3. Funny that.
The sounds in ME 2 seem to be better for headsets than surround sound splitting. I'm at the Shadow Broker's Base and the storm effects and lighting capacitors sound different as compared to the squad being in different locations around you. What I mean is, a squadmate can say something on the left and you hear them on the left, while the lightning capacitor on the left sounds like its everywhere.

I remember watching my older brother play Mass Effect 2 and 3 when I was only 10. I even remember him choosing the green ending in Mass Effect 3 (lol). Fast forward 10 years, and here I am writing a review about the whole series. It's all come full circle, and I'm glad I picked it up when I did.

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition does an outstanding job as far as a remaster/extended cut goes. All games have been upgraded with quality of life improvements, better graphics, and in some cases, new dialogue. None of it takes away from the original games, though; through endless wit, charm, and fantastic storytelling, the trilogy proves itself to be one of the best pieces of science fiction media ever made. Star Wars ain't got shit on this.

Because the original games have been preserved so well, I think it would be best to examine each game individually.

[b]Mass Effect:[/b] [u]7.8/10[/u]

Mass Effect 1 introduced us to the world of Mass Effect, and its through this game that we can find ourselves immersed in the lore of later titles. It started it all, though it was inevitable that there would be some missteps. The story is as robust as the other games, if a bit lacking in side missions. Exploring planets with the Mako was annoying, but you've probably heard that a million times by now. Lots of repeated assets between different levels made the game feel a bit samey, though it comes off as a product of its time more than anything. Despite all of this, it is a great introduction to the franchise, and it sets up the rest of the games well through fantastic world-building. The last couple hours of the game make up for a lot of the mistakes in my book. Saving the Citadel from Saren and the Geth will never not be sick as fuck.

[b]Mass Effect 2:[/b] [u]9.5/10[/u]

Yeah, I know everyone rates this game highly, but it's for good reason. Mass Effect 2 is inarguably the best entry in the entire series. It innovated not only the franchise, but also the entire gaming industry as a whole. Top-tier complex storytelling, worthwhile and exciting side missions, and a plethora of riveting characters made this entry endlessly enjoyable. 

It pioneered the dialogue wheel and set precedents for what modern, AAA RPGs could look like. The gunplay was vastly improved from Mass Effect 1, with useful powers that weren't just crutches. You could actually roleplay based on the class you chose, allowing you to specialize into certain playstyles. The Citadel, Omega, and Illium were all unique worlds to sink your teeth into. So many companions were added to this game, and none of them are boring or feel like filler (except for maybe Kasumi and Zaeed, but they're DLC characters, so they get a pass imo). The story itself was great-- ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" times eleven-- with it culminating in a suicide mission that rewarded careful playthroughs.

One of my only hangups is that certain characters from ME1 weren't brought back as companions in ME2: Kaidan/Ashley, Liara, and Wrex. It made things pretty bittersweet when you inevitably visited them later in the game, especially if you romanced one of them in the previous game. Not only this, but these interactions were pretty thin, with Liara being the only one to get a real, dedicated mission. It wasn't earth-shattering, but definitely a nitpick, even if it would be fan-service-y.

Overall, this is the best Mass Effect title. If you even remotely like gaming, this is a must-play.

[b]Mass Effect 3:[/b] [u]8/10[/u]

Mass Effect 3 continued a lot of the same strengths of Mass Effect 2 with new innovations. Allowing players to pick whatever weapons they wanted was a solid quality of life improvement, opening up new opportunities for roleplaying. The powers felt less substantial in this game, and I often found myself opting for my weapons instead of my powers in firefights (even with maxxed-out Sticky Grenades and Incinerate). From what I hear, the multiplayer was actually pretty fun back in the day too, so I'm disappointed that it wasn't remastered in the Legendary Edition. 

The side missions took a noticeable dip in quality, however, with many of them being fetch quests. It was pretty damn annoying to have to spend an hour or two collecting obscure artifacts on random planets just to squeeze out some extra war assets. The overall story felt pretty compact and linear, with there being less main story missions compared to ME2. The missions were just as high-quality as the ME2 ones, though, if not higher-quality in some cases. There was also less of an ability to impact the story with your actions; at this point, you are pretty much set to defeat the Reapers somehow, Paragon or Renegade.

The companions were great if a bit sparse in this game. I missed having an actual team like in ME2. Here, you get a squad of about half as many people, though most of them are familiar faces. You can also revisit most of the survivors from ME2 through the Citadel DLC, which was a huge highlight for me. Reconnecting with all of your companions throughout the series in missions, dialogue, and a party was a very thoughtful and creative way to utilize fan-service, and it paid off. Romantic partners from the previous games were given the right amount of time and consideration, concluding their relationships with Shepard fittingly.

One of my biggest gripes with this game is one that is shared by most fans. Yes, it's the ending. Spoilers ahead. [spoiler]I hate how the only options that you're given are to control the reapers, synthesize all organic and inorganic life without their consent, destroy all inorganic life (including the Geth and EDI, despite the effort you just went through to save the Geth), or walking away, letting the world end again. I feel like this is just a really bad trolley problem between the destroy ending and the synthesize ending, which are the only two sensible ones in my mind. It comes down to this: save Shepard (destroy) or save inorganic life (synthesis)? I don't feel like it lines up with the rest of the series very well, as it tries too hard to push the message of life being about hard choices. The idea that synthetics and organics can only coexist by synthesis is also suspect: how, then, were the Quarians and the Geth able to resolve their differences? What about EDI and Joker being partners? I chose the destroy ending since I didn't trust the child and I knew beforehand that it was the only one that let Shepard live, but the thought of losing the entirety of the Geth and EDI after everything was pretty stupid. The synthesis ending was also too neat of an ending imo; the only consequence was Shepard's death, and in return, galactic peace. If the Reapers did this before and it failed, as the child says, why should it work this time?[/spoiler] There's a lot more to be said about the ME3 endings that I will be surely reading after this post, but just know that it's pretty disappointing.

As a whole, Mass Effect 3 is a great game with some minor flaws and a bad ending. It's a fitting conclusion to the series despite everything. 

[b]Overall:[/b] [u]9/10[/u]

Mass Effect: Legendary Edition has been a blast for me. It took me well over a month, over 125 hours, and two playthroughs of ME3 ([spoiler]DAMN YOU ILLUSIVE MAN[/spoiler]), but I can safely say that I enjoyed almost every moment of it. Again, Mass Effect is one of the best pieces of science fiction ever made, and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to play it while it's still pretty fresh. With another game in development, I'm cautiously optimistic to see how BioWare will continue to innovate with Mass Effect (despite the failure that was Andromeda). So far, it looks like it's got a lot going for it, with many familiar faces from the original team returning to work on it.

One of the few games that feel like revisiting an old friend. I played these games during a difficult period in my life where I lost my mom, came back from the Afghan war not entirely right, and was drinking myself into oblivion.

Can't say it changed any of those things, but it made me realize that the world is a lot bigger than what we think it is, and it made me dig deeper into myself as a person to try and figure exactly where I stood and what I need to do in this life.

You'll fall in love with all the characters and you'll learn something about yourself making decisions as Shep. If you're a new generation gamer and are on the fence about this, just take the leap. Guarantee you'll get something out of this.

ME1 is a little rough, but still a fun little gateway into an incredible universe. 
ME2 fleshes everything out and builds in a substantial way where you truly feel like you're traveling across the galaxy.
ME3 finishes the adventure by giving you a damn 60 hour epic action movie of ass whupping gameplay, closing out a 180 hour adventure through space.

IMO worth the price and will always be up there with FF6, CT, Fallout 2, Divinity 2, as games that I'll always go back to in those times where I need to reflect on things.

I initially started on 'Veteran' difficulty and was so bored by the combat, that I switched to Casual just to get through the story.

Combat is much improved in the first instalment, and the relative unification of the combat systems across the titles is much appreciated in the pack.
Visuals are much improved in ME1, not as much in 2 & 3. Recommend using ALOT from the Nexus to fix texture problems that remain unfixed, especially above 1080p.
Performance is quite good, as you would expect for such old games. My 1070ti rig can run these comfortably at 4k60 without sacrificing settings.
The modding scene is relatively well-populated already, which means there are many ways to customise and improve the game to your liking.

The RRP is laughably high on this pack, but on a 20% off sale of more I can comfortably recommend it to sci-fi & RPG fans. Remember, the visuals are, by and large, NOT a step up from the original releases as Bioware just ignored all blurry, muddy 360-era textures.

I haven't finished ME3, so this will just be about parts 1 and 2. 

ME1

PROS: The overhaul on the gameplay and graphics is pretty noticeable. 
Combat is a bit more like parts 2 and 3, but still wonky, as it's based off of RNG, which parts 2 and 3 are not.
Performance on the PC is a huge improvement. I was getting some weird stuttering, but I disabled the EA overlay, and that fixed the problem.
The environments look much better, not nearly as dated. Lighting and textures really make a difference. 
The Mako is now tolerable. 

CONS: 

Despite the overhaul, it still is an older game, and that comes through. Since this is a remaster, and not a remake, that was to be expected. But sometimes you'll really feel the age of the game come through. 

Mako and Side Missions. Ok, this was a carryover problem from the original. The side missions in this game are mostly garbage. It's not that they're written poorly, it's that they are miserable to play, and that hasn't changed.

I mentioned the Mako is tolerable, but on the side missions, it isn't. That's because the planet design is god awful. So not only do you have terrible controls, but you have a planet design that actively exploits the worst part of the controls. There are several planets where map markers are virtually inaccessible due to the mountains they are on, or behind. And, the map checkpoints are usually just question marks, so you can spend 10 minutes trying to get to an object, only to find out you don't have the skill to open/examine it. 

I HIGHLY recommend either skipping some side content, or spreading it out, so you don't do too much of it at once. The story missions are great, and the usage of the Mako in them works, because you're going down paths. 

That is really my biggest gripe. 

I'll get to ME2 later maybe. ME2 didn't change much, but didn't need to. Still the best in the series.",1621203786,1687223459,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

They went from Origin, an already frustrating necessity to playing their game HERE, to forcing the EA app down our throats which essentially broke a lot of things. 

First off, ACHIEVEMENTS ARE BROKEN! After the first game, it is impossible to earn any achievements in the second and third games as EA thinks they're already unlocked or something. These are huge games, finishing them all will easily take 60+ hours. I did NOT have this issue in 2021 when it worked via Origin; this is an issue brought by the change to the new EA App which has not and likely will not be fixed. The only way to fix this is to find an old installation of Origin as the latest version is soft locked due to an irremovable box demanding you install the EA app.

I am also amazed at how they packaged this collection with upscaling and remasters but then failed to fix such blatantly inexcusable bugs. Issues with the original games are still here. I encountered a bug where my hotbar in the second game was broken and using any of my or my squad's powers instantly crashed my game 80% of the time. This extended to my save file, my save was therefore corrupted and I had to finish the game like this. Finishing the games with these bugs was very frustrating.

Now I have 100% game here's troubles big and small I had:

• ME2 and ME3 achievements are broken, it is possible to get them but it you need to take additional steps to get them which is annoying.

• [u]all of these games have bugs left from their original classic games unfixed !!![/u]

• ME1 does not have pinnacle station dlc in it because developers lost source code but modders somehow managed to bring it into game.

• audio rarely bugs into being mono(comes from single center speaker) instead of stereo(multiple speakers).

• Armax arena still has bug where enemies no longer spawns and it is impossible to proceed futher, only loading previous save works. There's 1 achievement related with arena.

• Animations ported from original games, nothing serious or game breaking, just not very good these days. sometimes they break and your character suddenly speaks to other character crotch area...

It's AMAZING (and I say that as someone who isn't that much into sci-fi universes) but I honestly wouldn't recommend buying anything from EA. I spent two days trying to troubleshoot this game due to constant FPS issues (about 20 FPS in the main menu and anywhere between 10-40 in the actual game, regardless of the game settings) only to realize that there is a problem with the Origin launcher which is forced to launch and stay in the background for unknown reasons. It singlehandedly slaughtered my FPS from 240 to the values mentioned above.

To fix that, you can go to C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\EA Desktop\EA Desktop and rename the file ""IGO64.dll"" to something else so that Origin doesn't launch its overlay ever again.

I've seen that some people can still experience frame drops regardless of that which is yet another reason why I cannot recommend paying for this game, at least until it gets fixed (which it probably never will). The actual game is awesome though.


UPDATE: I now have 186 hours in this game. I've completed the entire trilogy, including Mass Effect 1 twice. I STILL wouldn't recommend buying this on Steam - due to the aforementioned frame drops, as well as achievements in ME2 and ME3 not working (I would recommend this guide to fix that - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2951035198), however the games are absolutely wonderful.

EA now also forces you to install their godawful malware launcher that does not contain an option to actually exit out of. It's always open in the background draining your resources until you go into task manager to pull it out by the roots.

The mako still sucks.

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5 stars)

As an avid gamer and fan of the original Mass Effect trilogy, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. And what can I say? This remaster has far exceeded my expectations and is a truly epic masterpiece.

The graphical improvements are breathtaking. Every world, character, and battle looks so detailed and vibrant that you literally feel drawn into the Mass Effect galaxy. The game runs buttery smooth and the visual enhancements add a new intensity to the already compelling story.

But it's not just about the graphics. The revamped gameplay mechanics make combat more engaging and fluid. Character development and the skill system have been improved, which has allowed me to customize my squad members and adjust my play style. There are a variety of side missions and discoveries that bring the Mass Effect universe even more alive and make you feel like you're part of an epic odyssey.

The emotional depth of the characters is still impressive. The dialogue is believable and engaging, and the choices you make have an impact on the rest of the story. The bond I formed with my squad members felt so real that I really wanted to fight for them.

The Mass Effect Legendary Edition features not only the three main games, but all of the DLCs as well, making the overall experience even more comprehensive and rewarding. I was able to relive the trilogy and discovered additional content that I had previously missed.

Overall, I can wholeheartedly recommend the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. It's a must-have for any fan of the series and also a great way for newcomers to immerse themselves in the fascinating world of Mass Effect. Bioware has done a fantastic job with this remaster, proving that the fascination for the Mass Effect trilogy is timeless.

Prepare to be immersed in an epic space odyssey where you make decisions that affect the fate of the galaxy. Mass Effect Legendary Edition is an absolute masterpiece and a game not to be missed!

There is almost nothing to complain about. The story is perfect written, the gameplay is fun, the variety of character classes is many, the NPC are alive... Everything about the game is perfect.
However I did not finish it. There is a boss in DLC of ME3 that make I quit after trying many times in Insanity difficulty. However, I don't say this is the game problem, this is my fault to be lack of skill for it. 
I did finish the game in older trilogy though, so I think I have enough experience to make sure to you that:

I paid $15 for it, and at that price it's a deal. Although you may just want to buy the originals. They speak for themselves, and I'm rating this.

First off, the achievements are broken for the second two games. This is unacceptable. You can workaround it, but the programs always keep trying to update themselves. I shouldn't have to do this. They should sell a working product (I know, a lot to ask for today.)

There's no manuals for the games, and the games don't actually give you much instructions. They don't tell you what buttons do what. They were also too lazy/cheap to include a picture of the controller layout in the game. Also, unacceptable. I shouldn't have to Google controls for the game.

The cutscenes are of today's remaster quality. Poor. The voices are very often muffled, and the faces are usually too dark.

For some insane reason, likely data-harvesting, EA killed off Origin (which was finally working reliably) and created a whole new mandatory app that is even worse than Origin was when it first came out. When I launched this game through Steam it automatically installed the new app, but something was broken and the game would immediately close itself. The error message I got told me ""try again a little later"". Wonderful.

I finally got the game to work by uninstalling the automatic install of the EA App, and then manually installing it from EA's website. But apparently even that is broken because everyone else is reporting that achievements only work in ME1 and not in 2 or 3. Brilliant.

I'm only playing the first game right now, so hopefully by the time I get to the sequels, EA decides to fix their broken pos app.

Mass Effect 1:
Pros: 
-great story, great characters, cool environments 
-amazing soundtrack
Cons:
-game play is dated, shooting is unengaging, largely from having to waste time hiding for your guns to cool down. Just messes up the flow. 
-Inventory system is cumbersome and unnecessary. 
-Vehicle sections would be good if they were fewer and farther between but get repetitive and boring with how much they are used. 
-The same 3 interior environments are also used over and over just with crates moved around. 
-Large number of side missions feel like filler in between the few story missions. 
- hacking mini games are just button mashing
Overall: a good game only for the story, game play is a relic of a less refined time.

Mass Effect 2:
Pros: 
-shooting feels much better with reloading rather than having to hide until your gun cools down. Combat overall is tighter and more engaging. 
- limited vehicle sections with added platforming so you're not just driving across empty landscape
- characters and story are still a highlight
- inventory system replaced by well balanced upgrade system. 
- hacking mini games are more varied and aren't beatable just by button mashing anymore. 
- side missions are more integrated in the story and feel less like filler...mostly
Cons: 
-achievements are broken. There is a fix for windows if you mess around in the files but I play on Linux and can't be bothered
-soundtrack is still good but not as good as first game. 
Overall: big improvement over the first game in almost every way. Very fun. 

Mass Effect 3:
Pros: 
-Once again, great story and characters
-best gameplay in the series. Very tactical.

Cons:
-like in 2, achievements are broken
-more like mixed than con, but the ending. I don't think anybody really likes the endings, and  I think the reason the endings were so controversial is because the game tries so hard to push Synthesis as the Golden Ending that fixes all of the galaxy's problems when its so easy to poke so many holes in it with minimal thought and effort. The one thing positive that I will say about the endings is that a main theme of the series is victory through sacrifice. In the first 10 minutes of ME3 it is made very clear to the player that it is a war and in war you can't save everyone no matter how hard you try. This is something that is captured very well in the endings overall.

Ending discussion SPOILERS

- **Synthesis** : Galaxy wide peace and very quick rebuilding from the damage of the war. Everyone seems happiest in this. The problems are the philosophical and ethical implications. Are everyone still themselves, with their glowing eyes and circuits, holding hands and signing kumbaya with the Reapers who up until moments ago were harvesting them and their families? Is it right for Shepard to unilaterally alter all life in the galaxy on a molecular level to be cyborgs, and isn't this fundamentally what the Reapers were doing anyway? This ending could have used much more explanation and buildup. It comes off as meaning to be the ""Golden Ending"" by the developers, but comes out of nowhere and is very superficial. It seems like a problem that the Golden Ending involves making the galaxy into a hivemind. 

This also seems to go against another theme of the series of technology being ""gifted"" to a species before its culturally ready to handle it causing more problems than it solves, see the Krogan and Asari. Maybe synthesis is the next stage of evolution, but is it right for one person to just force it on everyone with the push of a button? Why does the starchild promise there WILL be peace with Synthesis, is everyone mind controlled? If everyone isn't mind controlled, won't it just be a matter of time before people find more reasons to fight? The Geth were fighting the Reapers and they're both synthetic, shouldn't they get along by the org vs synth logic? What if another enemy comes from outside the Milky Way and hacks the new hive mind? It happened to the Rachni. Javik admits part of the reason the Protheans lost to the Reapers is that they were too homogenous. How is homogenizing everyone into cyborgs to force ""peace"" really beneficial? 

What if the starchild is lying and you just indoctrinated the whole galaxy? I know that the developers have said since that he isn't lying, each of the options are what they say on the tin, but Synthesis is so poorly explained its really a problem.

- **Control** : Assuming Shepard is Paragon, this is the best for the galaxy Short and Medium term. The Shepard-AI controls an intergalactic peace keeping force that can rebuild all the damage quickly and then stick around to protect the universe from any potentially unruly species, like the Krogan, Leviathans, or future synthetic uprisings. However, the extreme long term is questionable. After a few 100k or millions of years who is to say Shepard AI doesn't go crazy and become a new starchild? Power corrupts and Shepard AI is a god in all but name now.  How many millions of years before he starts seeing people only as numbers?

- **Destroy** - Short term bad, long term good as things mostly return to pre-Reaper status quo. Extreme long term questionable as the future generations might make synthetics that go and kill them all. However I like to think that organics will have learnt enough from the Reaper Wars to prevent this. Downside is exterminating all current synthetic life, but ""the needs of the many..."" and such.

My Thoughts: I don't buy that organic vs synthetic conflict where synthetics wipe out organics is inevitable. Organics are going to war with other organics and driving each other to extinction all the time in the backstory of the game, why are synthetics being involved so beyond the pale? We see in the game its possible for the Geth and Quarians to make peace. We also see its possible for the organic Quarians to wipe out the synthetic Geth, depending on how things go. The Protheans were also winning their own war against their synthetics until the Reapers showed up to ""save"" them. There was another background species living at the same time of the Protheans, the Zha'til, who lived in symbiosis with their AI until the Reapers showed up and forced the AI to rebel. 

I think the real lesson is CONFLICT is inevitable, organic vs synthetic is irrelevant.  The Reapers have been running off of a questionable conclusion that is difficult to verify or disprove because they have been interfering with the data for so long. The Reapers wipe the slate clean every 50k years or so forcing organics to start over in order to ""save"" them from synthetics. The side effect of this is organics can never learn from the mistakes of the past and are forced to repeat the same mistakes again and again. This is then used by the Reapers as evidence of the inevitability of these problems and the need for a solution. The solution might be to let life run its course, come what may. Unity through diversity, another theme of the series. 

The best option is Destroy, as it wipes the slate clean of the Reapers allowing both current organic life and future synthetic life to forge its own destiny for the first time in over a billion years.",1685913420,1686526987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, in preparation for Starfield's release, I was looking for games with a similar idea to calm my excitement for a new Bethesda IP, and decided to bite the bullet and buy and play MELE.
A little over 400 hours in and just started a 3rd playthrough. I'm not a fan of ME1, because the controls and maps are janky compared to ME2 and 3, but it's also a game that was released in 2007 for Xbox 360, so, makes sense. For that, I can't hate on it.
That all being said, 2 and 3 are definitely the best, the characters and story is much more fleshed out, albeit the third game was clearly rushed (though still well made) and, even with the extended cut scenes that are within MELE, personally, I still find the alternate endings lack luster. Regardless, the games have replayability, even though ME1 is much like trying to survive through tedious things - unless you skip the small things and only play the story - and I'm incredibly excited to see what BioWare does for Mass Effect 5 (4 to those who would rather forget Andromeda), and have been hanging on to every bread crumb they drop.

Mass Effect always looked strikingly good, for its age. It aged well. I remember being impressed of ME1's graphics, for years after it had released. Toward the end of the 360 generation I revisited it and it still looked nearly as it did in 2007. 

It plays and feels much like it did in the past. Yes, they removed some of the the sexy shots of characters, like Miranda. I disagree with it in light of her explanation of being pretty confident about having been ""genetically engineered to be perfect."" Anyway...it was great to relive the stories again. Though, just like in 2013, you will be disappointed by Mass Effect 3's different colored ending. That was the ending that took all of my love out of the previous games. All that time, perfecting my play throughs, in an effort to have the (hopefully) ultimate ending for Mass Effect 3 and flushed it down the drain. 

The only issue, however, always was the open ended nature. Once you beat each game? That's it. Depending on which title you play, if you hadn't done many of the side quests, prior to beating the story, you won't have much to do afterward, since some of the side quests need to be done, before the story ends. This means that replayability is dependent upon how often you are willing to beat each title. You can't replay missions and, so, there's really nothing to do afterward. It's not The Elder Scrolls...and I hope that changes, come ME4. I would like to see an open world version of this title. 

If you haven't played the series? Then you absolutely must! I mean, you just have to!  I mean, at least 1-2.
I still question the graphics superiority of this game, versus, the graphics of the modded version of the game, as those textures were ground-up recreated and this remaster uses upscaling. They are pretty close, with the modded version of the original titles sometimes having the upper hand. So, not much changes if you've already played the PC versions with high rest texture packs. Plus, you get to see Miranda booty (lol) in those.

My only wish? A Halo Master Chief Collection approach at allowing your favorite missions be replayable. Many of you will just want to jump in and play your favorite moments. They should implement a mode where you can just choose your crew (alive or dead in your play through) and just roll through that mission. I'll bet the most played mission will be the Collector Ship in ME2. Either this? Or implementing a whole new survival/ game mode might be fun too. You could one-up the latter by letting friends join your game and taking control of MIranda, Edi, Liara, or any of the known allies. Even Ashley and Kaiden.",1643152826,1686501236,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After an hour into the first game I was hooked, the story, the characters, the setting and world building was impeccable - The first game uses dialog and the scenario of the game to really pull you into the mass effect world, I found myself watching youtube videos on the First Conctact Wars and The History that same night after jumping off the game. 

The 2nd Game, Now enveloped into the story, the reaper threat confirmed, and my cast of characters that I had built a relationship with throughout, it was the games peak I believe, easily my favourite. A twist in working with Cerberus, the characters developing throughout, Garrus and Tali easily became my go two picks, Tali is an amazing character, and nobodys beating my boy Garrus! - The climax of the 2nd Game was intense and enthralling, and I generally felt scared to lose anybody, although I did on my first playthrough. 

3rd Game - The story was set in stone, all character developed, fully invested into finishing the fight, a great game in it's rights, till the ending. The ending unfortunantely just ""lacks"" - I felt as though all my time with these characters to spend my last few moments alone was a diservice, I felt like I had made a lot of relationships with these NPCs and to have them not there in the final moment was upsetting to say the least. Overall a very good game still, gameplay was better, so many weapons and armours, nicknacks, loads, The DLC was amazing for ME3 too, aswell as ME2s DLC.

  The LE is fantastic, improving and streamlining so many features that came directly from suggestions made from the fans of this series. Despite it's close association with EA, it still feels like a love letter to fans, the whole experience feels ""like the first time"" in so many ways.

  I've tweaked a few streamlining issues with mods(most of which are applied earlier in the series-- If I don't specialize in a weapon, why am I carrying it?), but overall, the improvements are impactful and increase the longevity of my love for this series.

  I would say that the only downside is that one your playthrough is complete, is that you don't have anywhere to go.

But as a rating so far, I have gotten to about the middle of the first Mass Effect. So far it is excellent! There have been a few glitches (such as one of my saves saving sans ship, so Shepherd just floats in the clouds) and some dialogue I believe may be stuck. But these are easy fix-glitches. The gameplay itself is very fun and worth playing. The storyline is good, you get to make your own choices as to who goes where (like a true commander) and it's basically like being a mom in battle. (you protect your crewmates because NPCs can only be so smart in battle.) 

If one of my friends were to ask me if this were a good game, I always say it is amazing and I can't wait to play it every night after work. I would give it a 4/5 (one point marked off for the glitches and for EA Play having to be updated/patched nearly every time I launch the game.) (which to those who have a problem with EA play sending an error that the game cannot launch, it's EA play needing to be patched. Very simple, just go into computer settings, uninstall EA (EA should give an option to patch instead.) and it should fix the issue. 

But definitely worth the money as it is a one-time buy. ESPECIALLY during steam sales. Unfortunately I bought this full-price.

The good
3 games with almost all the DLC's included, for ME2 and ME3 all the DLC's. Extensiive story-lines with many options which give a strong replay-value, character which you can tweak to fit your playstyle and which also gives a strong replay-value. Great music, great story-buildup, good cinematography in especially Mass Effect 2, good action in especially ME3 and some DLC's which have an interesting storyline, lot of humor, good action and world-building. 

The bad. 
ME3 could have been even better if EA wouldn't have pulled some of the best people off the project in favor of their serial-games (sport and BattleField). Such a shame! As a result the cinematography and story are less good in Mass Effect 3 (they tried to solve it by patching it later) and the music is still good but less coheren due the absence of the lead composer of Mass Effect 2. 

The ugly. 
EA's launcher is dreadful. I recorded the launching process, it took an entire minute to get in the game, this on a PCIe4 SSD and with a Ryzen 3700X, DDR4 @3533 MT/s (16-18-16-16) and a 5700 XT. You click on launch, 10-15 seconds later you finally see Origin pop up, then after around 30-35 seconds finally the introscreen shows up and after around 41 seconds you get the main-menu, then it takes another 20'ish seconds to load the game itself. Come on! The game should be playable within 10 seconds, there is not that much data to be loaded in the RAM and videocard-memory. EA requires you for this game to always have an internet connection. Come on EA! This is why people pirate games. Dumb move! Don't punish paying customers. I don't know the current minimumprice of this game (so what the regular discount-% is)  but people are not going to pirate the game to not spend $15 or whatever on this bundle of 3 games. The ease of use (download it whenever you want, not needing that space on your SSD all the time, the game reliably working for many years) makes it worth it for gamers to just buy the game. But bully gamers with this internet-requirement crap and gamers get rewarded for pirating. Many developers are more flexible with this internet connection requirement, for example by 'only' requiring it once a week or whatever. Also consider those people who just don't have the ability to always be online, like people who work on see.

[b]+ Choice acknowledgement:[/b] The decisions you make in each of the first two games have ramifications in the latter entries. These can range from short e-mails from people you helped in the past, just keeping in touch, to the (in)ability to prevent a genocide and [spoiler]subsequent suicide of probably the most likable companion[/spoiler]. This is probably the most impressive aspect of the games; few developers have the foresight and guts to soft lock game-altering decisions based on a prequel save file import.

[b]+ Companions:[/b] Most of them are well written, with amusing interactions during missions. ME2 had the largest cast and some ended up being forgettable. Regardless, the companion quests from ME2 forward are good across the board. I enjoyed seeing one specific heist-themed quest that was intriguing but too simplistic serve as a template for a much improved version in ME3. Here, I have to give props to the writers for being able to create quality gag companion quests in ME3; today, I don't think the studio would be able to do such a consistently good job in this regard.

[b]+ Set pieces:[/b] I simply enjoy the expansive sceneries (mostly skyboxes) and imposing vistas that Bioware are able to create in their games. These really help set the scale for the game world and put the decisions you make into perspective. That is not to say that the level design leaves to be desired; in fact, the [spoiler]march across the Shadow Broker's ship in ME2[/spoiler] ended up being one of my favorite levels in any game. Also, it's worth mentioning that ME3 had significantly better produced cut-scenes (camerawork, music, etc.), at lest during its first few hours.

[b]+ Mini games:[/b] It amazes me how ME3 can have so many mini games (most of them simplistic, to be fair) when CDPR weren't able to include [i]anything[/i] of the sort in Cyberpunk 2077. I was not expecting any of them to be in the game, and I don't think most people will find much worth engaging with them regularly. However, they serve as great recreational activities to do with companions when on shore leave. Would have wished that these were not just scripted events and you'd have been able to invite them at any time.

[b]+ World exploration with Mako:[/b] A very enjoyable aspect of the first game that didn't make the cut in either of the sequels. The vehicle controls in low gravity made it fun to just wonder across planet surfaces. Would have liked to see a bit more biome diversity, but what's there could be considered a prototype for Death Stranding's main game loop.

[b]+ Voice acting:[/b] Was pleasantly surprised to hear Martin Sheen and Shohreh Aghdashloo in ME3 and ME2 respectively.

[b]- Steam port:[/b] Yet another example of the abhorrent practice of integrating third party launchers into Steam releases. In this case, it wasn't just a problem of boot time. I actually had to patch the Origin executable in order to prevent framerate dips due to its overlay (that you can't disable from the client's settings menu). In ME1, the game literally became unplayable while on the Normandy, with 5-15 fps. Moreover, EA's done a shoddy job integrating all three games into one application, at times having to go through 5-6 menus / loading screens just to resume a game.

[b]- Useless loot:[/b] This was most problematic in ME1 where you have a 300 item inventory capacity. The inventory management problem becomes less grating but the quality of the loot does not improve at all. There's no point during any of the games when you get excited for a drop. It's a shame that ME3 has so many weapons because during the first 2-3 missions you can just get a rechargeable laser rifle (akin to the weapons of ME1 - ME2 introduced ammo for all weapons) and it's so good that you don't have to even try out anything else for the remainder of the game.

[b]- Obvious console port:[/b] This is not an issue with the Legendary Edition, but with the original releases. Too many game functions are linked to the Space bar (i.e.: running, take / switch cover, interact) and you can't even directly vault over an obstacle; you first have to take cover behind it, then jump over. Starting with ME2, the UI also became unbearably large, covering most of the screen with useless fluff. Moreover, during the ME2 tutorial you even get an [i]in-game achievement[/i] for hitting a headshot... yet somehow, the Steam achievements have been broken since Origin got replaced by the EA Launcher...

[b]- ME1 shows it's age:[/b] Or rather, the lack of resources available to the developers at the time. It's a bit annoying, knowing that whatever dialogue option you choose, the same voice line is used. Moreover, the dialogue trees haven't been properly checked (e.g.: high charisma lets me spare some guards and the enemies later accuse me of murdering them). Then there are some design decisions that are simply moronic, like giving a [i]trained soldier[/i] just enough stamina to sprint for 10m before running out of breath. Not to mention that the recharging stamina bar is hidden while your weapon is stowed, which is preferable while out of combat since it increases your field of view. It's like the developers didn't even play test their own game before release...

[b]- Degradation of RPG elements:[/b] In my opinion, ME1 has more charm than the latter two games due to how it approaches quest design. If in ME2-3 you land on a planet, shoot your way through enemies and reach an objective, in ME1 you have an overarching goal but you need to discover and execute intermediary steps towards it. This doesn't just involve shooting your way out of an arena, but also uncovering clues and talking with NPCs. Even if there's usually a single solution to a problem, this design is much more rewarding, and the latter entries lost sight of that.

[b]- Resource probing in ME2:[/b] Probably one of the most idiotic systems I've encountered in a game. This activity is mind-numbingly boring and has no real impact on the game. Most upgrades are unattractive anyway and those that you'd want to purchase can be obtained with mission rewards. [i]However[/i], these activities become required if you wish to upgrade your ship. The ship upgrades have no visible gameplay impact (not like you have space battles) and only serve as a numeric check during the final mission to determine if 1-2 of your companion die during an initial cut-scene. The game never explains that this could be a possibility and the loss of certain characters could completely screw up your ME3 run. So if you look up the selection algorithm for the sacrificial companions and it turns out that one of them is critical to the story going forward (don't know how you'd find that out without spoliers), you'd be forced to grind resources to prevent the game from locking you out of critical story paths in the [i]next[/i] game.

[b]- Brainded AI:[/b] As much as the game likes to talk about the threat that AI poses to organic beings, it does a piss-poor job implementing it in its NPCs. The enemies have a tendency to leave cover and charge at you back-first (at least in ME1). Sometimes, during scripted events, it's possible to rush past the enemy line and cause them to lose track of you. So you can single handedly mow them down from behind and they won't even acknowledge your existence.

[b]- Bugs:[/b] Not that many, but there are a few game breaking ones. For example, a cut-scene fails to load during a scene transition. You retain control of the character but the screen goes black. The only option is reloading the game from the main menu (not for the in-game menu screen). So it may help saving from time to time, at least in between missions.",1685905541,1685906278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the essence of the first game still remains intact, so some of the leveling and combat still isn't as refined, just a lot more polished but still retains its style for those that still prefer and love that first game's gameplay design. The graphics have also been significantly upgraded to keep up with the 2nd and 3rd game, the same applies to the 2nd and 3rd game, who also got a visual upgrade, more significantly the 2nd game as overall the 3rd game was quite ahead for its time. The other big and important feature from this collection is that it features all the essential DLCs for the story, so now you can truly experience the game (specially the 3rd game) the way it was always meant to be without having to figure out how to get previous DLCs. 

But if you own the previous versions of these games on PC with all DLCs, is it worth playing this version? I think overall it does make significant improvements to justify upgrading, not to mention the modding scene for this version is the active one now, with a lot of great mods coming left and right to amplify the experience on these games. However, in terms of old bugs and such, the game hasn't changed much, so the modding community has done unofficial community patches to each game on the trilogy to tackle most of these bugs that were carried from the first 3 games, so I recommend checking those out. However, the current major issue and reason for downvoted reviews is EA Play. To play this game, you need to launch the EA app, now that's not terrible in principle, the problem is that the game will encounter significant issues because of this, including no longer being able to obtain trophies for the game. Ever since I changed from Origin to EA App (as forced by EA), I can longer get any trophies/achievements unfortunately. However, I still upvote this game as this experience is still too good that everyone should experience at least once.

Every now and then, you stumble upon a piece of fiction that is able to completely absorb you. 
For me, this is almost always in book form. Letting yourself completely immerse yourself in a made up reality for a bit. A title good enough to have you thinking about it. Eventually, you run out of content, read the last page or beat the last mission. Sit back, and for a moment you think to yourself, ""...What now?""

The ME Trilogy is one of those stories. It's definitely not without issues as a game. and certainly has its fair share of jank, but man is it worth it.

Although it's pretty much the best game ever made from my point of view, the game won't launch on steam because of issues with the EA app.

Yes the Game Itself Is great - but buying the original you really ain't missing out on anything. Yes the upscale in graphics are amazing from 15 years ago quiet obviously, but there are no extra perks worth playing, no extra characters, no extra missions worth playing, no extra Armours, Weapons, Dialog, Animations, level designs, maps... you can not pilot the mighty Normandy yourself around space and into planets like majority of these new space age games allows you to nowa days, you can't get a hair cut or modify your character AFTER you have created him or her, you can not switch out Characters during game-play. The story Is still bland around Cerberus group and choice trees are still basic. Ashley Is suppose to be with you on virmire because the animation Is of a female nature. I would like If none of my characters had to die, because dying Is irrelevant. choosing a new head for the next title is irrelevant If you choose not to save the council because in the second game, the Council still manage galactic activities.
some textures have not been taken into consideration. I would have liked elaboration on Citadel design. Extra geth was just a simple cop out for the last battle. I would have liked to employ more people onto the Normandy, The Normandy was too small - only shepard has a bedroom even though it is a multi crew vessel. hair textures and even armour textures were slapped over. The whole experience for £60 pounds was just far too basic. you'd be better off getting mods on your game where the community actually try to put a bit more care and time into the game to make it more fun and immersive. Certain times the modders just don't have the fields necessary to do as fine a job as the official team.
As I stated many years ago, Mass Effect 1 deserves a REMAKE. Same plasma guns that don't need bullets, and same feel to the game 'away from' ME2 and ME3. the game should elaborate on everything giving more choice trees, better character designs (awesome with negrow hair styles but no where near enough), and obviously make ME1 a sandbox. Garments should have much more customisation value. in game economy so better use of credits, and being able to buy homes, pets, and chill out farming, cooking, scanning environments on science expeditions etc etc.

There are some nuisances to the game, but nothing that greatly detracts from how fun it is to just progress through the story and game. 100 hours of gaming and incredible experiences for 20 bucks is too good a deal to turn down.

Interesting and engaging characters and story, very good space exploration, fun combat, beautiful visuals.  Lots of nods to classic scfi from people like Ridley Scott, Jim Cameron, John Carpenter, and Robert A. Heinlein.  

It maybe can't touch the great CDPR games in terms of writing and characters, but who can these days?  All I know is that it's keeping my interest in a way that more recent RPG's like Hogwarts Legacy and Horizon Zero Dawn could not.  It's maybe lacking in some quality of life features that we've come to expect in modern RPG's, but for me this has been nothing too distracting or annoying.  It's curious though how way back in the day Bioware created a perfectly viable and fun military space opera, yet fast forward to today and we have Chris Roberts' Star Citizen nowhere near beta release after nearly a decade and half billion in crowdfunding dollars.  

I would also add that this series made Jennifer Hale one of gaming's first voice acting superstars, and deservedly so.  She does an amazing job breathing life into Commander Shepard.  On a related note, one of my pet peeves from the MSM journos and fan community is the trite and cheesy term 'FemShep' (but please don't take me too, too seriously here ;)

Anyway, I may update this review as I advance into MA2 and 3, but for now I would close by saying that this game has greatly exceeded my expectations.  Thank you to my Steam friends who recommended this series to me, and as always thanks everyone for taking the time to read this.

It's still a dated game and it shows in some areas, but with a few mods that you can install easy using ME3Tweaks mod manager (where you just drag and drop some stuff, you can help make it a better experience.  But even without mods, it's still a great game that as is I would recommend it anyway as long as you don't have the originals.  if you do have the originals, do a side by side comparison of features (The remaster has photomode but the OG me3 has multiplayer) to see if it's worth it.

Steam achievements beyond ME1 are all broken without having to do some crazy workaround so I haven't bothered.

I'm writing this in mid-2023. The game released May 2021 and there are STILL problems with it.

Graphical issues I can endure and there aren't a ton here. I get t-poses from characters here and there. Occasionally you'll kill an enemy and rather than the game playing their death animation they will just freeze in mid air. Or their death animation from gunfire will cause them to randomly rag doll 100 feet in the air. VERY infrequently but still there. But overall the new coat-of-paint on the Legendary Edition looks pretty good. I'm playing the game on a 21:9 ultrawide which is supported (though I wish companies would come up with a more seamless transition between 16:9 cut scenes to ""ready-to-play"" ultrawide sequences other than black pillar bars just popping out.)

One annoying aspect of the LE package (ignoring for a moment the EA/Origin app fiasco) is launching the game requires you to go into a trilogy launcher (with an unskippable opening animation) from which you then pick the game you want to play which THEN starts THAT games unskippable opening animations before dropping you in your save. This seems like a concession built for consoles that is clunky and maddening on PC (especially adding the Origin/EA boot layer ON TOP of THAT.)

But there are a handful of actually painful bugs. For superfans who have played through the series multiple times, one of the carrots in the package is achievement chasing (the achievements have been retooled from the original releases (in the case of ME 1, thank God,)) and I have run into a bug that, past a certain point, causes me to be unable to open new achievements EVEN ON A BRAND NEW SAVE. Steam shows my achievements unlocked to a particular point but the menu screen of any specific game shows that I have unlocked every single achievement for every game, including the Insanity run. I've done some Googling and this STILL unfixed bug happens to people randomly during their play-through of the trilogy. Mine happened in the opening of the third game. 

The problem (apparently) was introduced when EA switched from the Origin app to the EA app. And because there is a User profile file independent of your saves, starting a new save carries the problem over. Worse, the issue gets sync'd to the cloud through the launcher so deleting your local saves doesn't fix the issue. At one point you could manually download the old Origin app as a workaround but EA has since pulled that installer from it's site.

A couple months ago, a new workaround became possible. If you're experiencing the issue, you can blow away your user profile file (google for the location,) boot the EA app, switch it to offline mode (an ability they added this year,) and then boot the game. Since then I've been able to pickup ME 3 again and keep achievement chasing. However, I boot the EA app and switch it to offline mode before every play session, even though I'm not certain that's necessary.

As I got into 3 though, I found that the imported save somehow didn't reflect all of the decisions I had carefully made in my play-through of Mass Effect 2. Avoiding spoilers, so far no Jack, no Legion (which makes a tough Rannoch story-beat then impossible.)

The sad part is that I know the real problem here is me: I paid for this, knowing better. I have put nearly 100 hours in at this point and know that I will put in more. Because Mass Effect is still Mass Effect, one of my favorite game series of all time - even if the package it's wrapped in is depressingly beneath it's legacy. If PC is your only option, this is the one you want to buy. The individual originals on Steam don't support controller and STILL require you to use EA's launcher. But if you have the option of picking up the package on Xbox or PS, I would grab it there instead. They won't be perfect either but I'd be shocked if they were in as sorry a state as this one.

Update - More bugs:
-The Citadel DLC was severely bugged. Everything prior to the party ran fine but, in addition to some characters I saved in ME2 just not being in ME3 for me, the entire party sequence kept breaking.
-Your personal computer screen has options for 'invite X up for one on one conversation,' and 'invite people to the party.' Trying to invite someone up for a one-on-one conversation triggered Glyph's party-starting dialogue chain.
-Reloading would drop me immediately into the cut scene for whatever 1:1 conversation I was trying to trigger.
-When I finally tried to invite-all to the party (which is one of the MOST fun sequences in the game) it omitted 75 percent of the people on the list INCLUDING all of the really fun cameos. In total, the party had five people.
-In conversations with Glyph, he was sporadically just not onscreen and Shepard was speaking with an empty room (that's a golden oldie bug from the OG trilogy.)
-For the first 1-2 'phases' of the party, Tali was frozen in the corner, not even doing her standing/breathing animation. Statue-esque. When I tried to talk to her nothing happened. When I reloaded the save it immediately loaded me into the cut scene conversation with her.

I consider the Citadel DLC the actual closure/conclusion to the trilogy (I save it as the last thing todo right before the Illusive Man assault) and to have it this broken with more than half the characters you spent 100+ hours having conversations with omitted is an incredible bummer.

Man, how did I sleep on this for so long? The story was fantastic but this first game has some dated controls, the minimap is not useful at all, and the writing is... not at its strongest yet, probably. Some characters teach you lore, others teach you about themselves; Not a good personality to lore ratio in the characters for this first game. But the story and lore have got me hook, line, and sinker. I've heard nothing but good things about the sequel, so I'm jumping right back in.

It's ok. I played the originals a lot. This doesn't add anything spectacular. But it is a nice package. Expecially on sale. There seem to be many more bugs and the sticky wallcover suddenly is a hassle in Me2. I don't know what it is, but it plays a lot more frustratingly, like shooting from cover sometimes bugs out very weirdly, like it doesn't know at which side to aim. 
Also selection boxes sometimes completely miss the actual subject, so it's very hard to aim or locate.
Somtimes Shepard locks itself in a certain stance when interacting with objects like screens or weapon loadouts. And sometimes Shepard keeps running into the same place, for reasons.

I cannot recall having these frustrating problems/issues in the original. It is so sloppy.

Thumbs down because with the bad new EA launcher achievements don't unlock.

ME1 - Mass Effect One kicks of what is still for me, one of the best SCI-FI RPGs of all time. The Story is immersive, the Graphics in the Legendary edition are stunning and after a fair few year away from all things Mass Effect, it feels good to return to the Normandy and its companions; As you Stomp Geth, discover the mystery of the now extinct Protheans, and race against time to track down stop Saren from succeeding in his schemes. Whist ME2 is mine and the peoples favourite for the most part, ME1 deffo deserves your time.

Now, after 3 playthroughs I can say without a doubt that Mass Effect (the trilogy as a whole, not just the first game) is my favourite game of all time.

The story is gripping, thought-provoking and action packed, the characters are (90-95% of the time) well fleshed out and felt like old friends after you've done some missions with them and finally the story lines and quest structures hold up well. Even the first game (which can be a bit fetch-questy and most side quests are the same rotation of interiors slightly redesigned for each quest) still convinced me to explore every single quest in my second and third playthroughs!

I could spend hours talking about all the things that I love about this game (and have with friends) but I'll sum it up like this.

I am very late with having this game played for the very first time, but the appealing steam sale finally convinced me.
When I started with the first game, the story was very compelling and exciting. Never ever have I felt any kind of boredom throughout the entire playthrough. I am currently deep into Mass Effect 2, and am yet to feel bored in any way. The story keeps it's exciting note and keeps surprising with non-predictable conversations and changes.
The sidequests of Mass Effect 2 are way more appealing than the ones from Mass Effect 1, in my personal opinion. Maybe because I am more drawn to newer games...

So sum it up though I'll have to give this game a huge upvote. I'm not really too deep into any Sci-Fi games, but this series has definitely changed my mind and I'm also going to give the Halo series a shot in the future.

Also, so far, I haven't had any trouble with the EA launcher as many people described and hence downvoted the game on steam. Of course I hope his is going to last throughout the entire series.",1685019664,1685019664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mass Effect.  What, really, can I say about Mass Effect that thousands of others haven't said already?  It's an icon of Bioware before they went on to make Andromeda and Anthem.  It's a trilogy encompassing many different sci-fi aesthetics, from the shiny, Star Trek-like utopias, to the dirty, grungy underbellies that works like Deus Ex and Star Wars revel in, to the 'eldritch space' that things like the Lovecraft Mythos, Kirby, and Florida all excel in.

Here's my hat in this overcrowded hat-rack of a ring, then.

Mass Effect: LE is the original trilogy, given a major coat of visual polish, and bundled with almost all the single-player DLC.  Almost, because Pinnacle Station's source code was corrupted.  Whoops.

In gameplay terms, Mass Effect is half role-playing game, half cover-based third-person shooter.  Between talking with your crew, tackling sidequests, or going from point of interest A to point of interest B, you're taking cover behind benevolently placed chest-high walls and shooting at people.  Or using powers (this series' take on spells, buffs, debuffs, crowd-control, etc.) on said people.  Or both.  Often both.

This formula does get tweaks between games; ME1 had all weapons have unlimited ammo, but limited time to fire before they overheated, and Powers ran on individual cooldowns.  Weapon modifications were plentiful, weapons themselves were quite common and often came in duplicates, but most of them were the same basic archetype with a few numbers tweaked between them, with how you modified them causing the performance differences.  Armor was the same; Visual differences and different numbers, but a lot of survivability came from modding it.

ME2 gave all weapons thermal sinks, limiting their ammo but letting you fire away, and you could only use one Power at a time; Cooldowns were still case-by-case, but you could no longer just play your hotbar like an accordian to win fights.  Armor and weapons were much rarer, and almost always performed differently or 'upgraded' off your older weapons.  Modifications were excised or made class-wide and researched in the lab instead of found by the dozen in the field.

ME3 struck something of a middle ground.  Your weapon load affects your cooldowns, so a lightly-armed Shepard can sling Powers around like alcohol at a college party, while one bogged down with guns aplenty will find their cooldowns rather lengthy indeed.  Modifications are back to being found in the field and back to being applied to weapons on a case-by-case basis, but now you only need one copy to modify every weapon in that mod's class; Spares merely upgrade the mod itself.

And now, I'm going to break from my usual routine and discuss each game as it's own entity.


[h1]MASS EFFECT 1[/h1]
[i][b]""YOU EXIST BECAUSE WE ALLOW IT.  AND YOU WILL END BECAUSE WE DEMAND IT.""[/b][/i]

The original game was arguably the most in need of gameplay fixes; While the rest of the trilogy could, and did, receive a major graphical touch-up, the first game had a lot of oddities and problems that, I'm happy to say, LE took the time to fix up, especially regarding the Mako.  It's a much smoother game on the actual 'game'-y bits, as opposed to a very solid story backing up a game with some very rough edges.

Visually, this is the game that most represents 'Shiny Sci-Fi'; A dream of a better tomorrow, a clean future where curves are the new edges, where humanity isn't alone and most of the aliens are friends, or at worst, political foes rather then military ones, and where the confrontations involve mostly robots, or hostile aliens on the fringes of galactic society.

It's story is not quite light-hearted, Virmire and the introduction of [b]Sovereign[/b] spring to mind as counter-points, but of the trilogy, it does have that sort of 'Sci-fi movie'-like feel.  What begins as 'stop a rogue state-sanctioned black-ops agent' soon spirals into the eldritch territory, but proves that, yes, the spooky eldritch abomination can be punched out if everyone works together.  Mass Effect 1's overall storyline was a bit basic, a bit bare-bones in spots; It almost feels like it wasn't going to be a trilogy at first, and 2 and 3 were greenlit after this launch.

Regardless, Mass Effect 1 is a good game on it's own two feet, standing as a primer and introduction to the trilogy, and introducing and setting up the stakes for the rest of the series to follow.

What followed it up was even better.


[h1]MASS EFFECT 2[/h1]
[i]""We will fight for the lost!""[/i] 
[spoiler]It's a damn shame that line was advertising-only, huh...[/spoiler]

If Mass Effect 1 was Star Trek, Mass Effect 2 was Mirror-Universe Star Trek.  Whereas ME1 had you traipsing about the well-lit and smooth Citadel, ME2 has you gallivanting around the gritty, grungy nightclub-slash-crime den of Omega and the beautiful, but completely amoral, Illium.

If ME1 was about listening to dialogue and making choices, ME2 had that, but added quick-time reactions called Interrupts, which allowed you to potentially influence events by making direct choices mid-dialog, be it hugging someone in distress or politely encouraging someone to take a break via a helpful 20,000-volt two-step nap.  Where ME1's story was reactionary, reacting to new threats or potential problems, ME2's story is pre-emptive, with Shepard and co. moving on leads ASAP and never staying in port for long.

If ME1's HUD was a soothing blue, ME2's was a slightly louder orange.  If ME1 politely asked you to use your Powers but gave gunslingers nigh-unlimited room to operate, ME2 forced you to use them as ammo was depleted and weapon after weapon greeted your request to fire with a loud 'click' and nothing to replace it.

If Mass Effect 1 was A New Hope, Mass Effect 2 was The Empire Strikes Back; A game about overwhelming odds, where the heroes don't quite succeed despite their best efforts, and where the threat is still out there, emboldened, and bigger then ever.

What followed it up was better still, after some time.


[h1]MASS EFFECT 3[/h1]
[i]Take.  Earth.  Back.[/i]

Mass Effect 1 was shiny.  Mass Effect 2 was gritty.  Mass Effect 3 is scarred.

The game deals with war, the weight of a galaxy resting on your shoulders, what that [i]means[/i] for those so weighed down, and death.  It deals with the end of days, the desperation of those still alive, the death of the old ways and the fight to survive and thrive.  It deals with fighting the eldritch, the unknown, at it's peak.

The game reminds you of the bleak tone, time and time again.  Nothing is safe or sacred.  Allies who you've known the entire trilogy, or even since ME2, can and will die, sometimes unavoidably, but often due to your choices not working out.  Races you've come to learn about die, or perhaps experience a resurgence, from the consequences of choices made all throughout the trilogy.  ME1 and ME2 were setup, and ME3 is the payoff.

If the prior games gave you lots of resources, and limited-but-fair resources, ME3's are finite and painfully so.  Heavy weapons are now a rarity, a beloved sight for sore eyes, rather then an impressive mainstay of your arsenal.  Powers retain ME2's system of 'use one, all cool down', but that cooldown can be modified by weapon load; Do you take less, or lighter weapons to cast faster, at the expense of potentially running dry and having to rely only on powers mid-firefight, or do you take the heaviest guns you can and relegate your powers to one-offs or quick-use panic buttons for when things get especially bad?

ME3 asks the player to make tough choices, all the time.  And you, the player?  You can only hope you made the right ones.

[b]Get ME: LE.  It's the best way to experience the trilogy.[/b]

Instead of ironing out the old bugs, the LE has 3 times more glitches than the original games, especially when playing as a Vanguard. The ""improvements"" in ME1's gameplay are merely a buff to starting accuracy. Admittedly a much needed change, but with all the talking I was half expecting the very badly aging ME1 to be reworked to have the later games' gameplay, making it feel more modern, but that would've taken actual work and we obviously wouldn't want that.

I'm also disappointed by the lack of Pinnacle Station DLC for ME1, which I understand they didn't have the code for... but you're selling this at full price. Bloody rebuild it! It's not like it was that big of a DLC anyway.

The only major improvement is in the settings. Still not up to modern standards mind you, but given that to change mouse sensitivity in the old PC port you had to go in the game files, this is still a massive step-up. Also Tali's ass, which looks great in 4K.

The appeal of Steam, to me at least, has always been how easy it was to install and play games when I wanted. This is no longer the case because of companies like EA. Maybe do something about it Valve? Before you are swallowed whole.
Your warnings about the third party DRM (Origins) isn't even accurate any longer.

I repeat: You. Can. NOT. Use. Origins.

It forces you to switch to a different, very broken and annoying launcher (EA app). And you Valve, are misinforming your customers as a result of it.

to get your achievement working

1. OPEN ME:LE ON STEAM
2. AFTER BIOWARE INTRO YOU WILL BE DIRECTED ON THE VERY FIRST ME:LE MENU (WHERE YOU CHOOSE ME1, ME2, AND ME3)

6. CLICK THE 3 BAR AT THE TOP LEFT CORNER (ON EA APPS)
7. CLICK ""GO OFFLINE""
8. CLOSE EA APPS
9. GO BACK TO YOUR ME:LE
10. ENJOY UR ME2 AND ME3 ACHIEVEMENTS.

Still a great series despite its numerous flaws (mostly in the third game), well worth playing especially with mods that fix a few things here and there.

Mass effect 3 ended up being a massive disappointment due to EA being really really shit at running game studios and went on to create Mass Effect Andromeda which was a new low in game release and effective killed the franchise dead. - Thanks EA
When the idea of a legendary edition came along that included all the DLCs and improved level design, graphics and gameplay for a new generation of people, I considered buying it just to have the definitive edition of the game, but boy, is this game broken!
Firstly getting the launcher to actually launch is a mission.  EA have this app you need to install ON TOP of steam.  It used to be called Origin, but now its just called the EA app, and it is a fussy nightmare of bad programming.   It *might* connect, but it also most probably wont,  It wont tell you why!  it just doesnt!
Getting through this requires a restart of your computer.... Thats fine, but then iI started to notice that this was eating up space on my boot drive and found it was saving crash logs to the drive which filled the drive up with rubbish.  Deleting these did not improve the situation
In game, Legendary edition is a mess.  ""improved Graphics"" must have been overseen by JJ Abrams because there is annoying lens flare everywhere.  none of the actual games have been updated *that* much, in fact, they have removed as much as they put in.  the ability to press space and bypass the elevator scenes is nice, but why change the action button?  The old versions of the game used teh ""E"" key to do an action.... now its ""space"".   a completely un-necessary change
Most of the DLC stuff for Mass Effect is poor.  mostly consisting of missions where you go to a new location, shoot something, and repeat until the mission is complete.  
ME3 however is a doozy of legendary proportions and was a crash fest of absolute miserable storytelling and poorly executed ham fisted missions that end up with shepherd losing most of his team and dying.
Quite why this had to end in an existential crisis  about synthetic amalgmation or destruction is beyond me.  its as disappointing as tit was the first time around and considering the lack of improvements, i would suggest you avoid this like the steaming pile of crap it is.  Mass Effect is dead.  EA killed it.  apparently a 4th one is in the offing, but this collection serves as an example of how far removed from reality EA are, no longer concerned with putting out GOOD games, but just putting any old shit out in an effort to steal $70 from your wallet.
I Own ME1 and 2 from back when they were originally released, but I got the legendary edition for £15 in a steam sale.  I suggest you wait for a sale before even considering this pile of crap.  it is somehow worse that I remember and no better for the ""improvements"" EA promised.

If you don't own the original trilogy it's a no brainer, easily one of the best RPGs that exists.

If you do however you gotta weight the changes made to the things you can do via modding.

I would leave ME2 and ME3 out of this equation as they mostly just got texture upgrades and the only thing i can think of right now is ME3 War Readiness score which does not need Multiplayer games in MELE, but you can achieve that with mods or cheats in base ME3 as well.

The changes to ME1 are good, but i would not say its worth 60€ if you already own ME1+2+3. Get it on a discount though if you really like Mass Effect and play it regularly as the changes make ME1 a bit better and less annoying as the original.

I don't know yet if modding will be easier for MELE, but thats something to keep an eye out as well.

TL;DR: 
* Don't own the 3 games? Buy it, they are great.
* Own the 3 games? Check if the changes to ME1 are of importance to you or buy at a discount.",1625774862,1684496727,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

ME:LE is a game-containing product that you have to fight for the right to enjoy it.

Let's start with the undeniable pros: ME1 gameplay is greatly improved. That's about it. That's the only major, immediately noticeable improvement across all three games. Admittedly, it's a *vast* improvement. Gunplay is far better, elevator rides can be skipped, you don't have to play the damn thing thrice to 100% it, there is a marginally better way to sort through all the junk, etc.

Everything else is some monkey paw nonsense. Graphics are shored up, textures are noticeably higher-resolution, some ME3 assets have been backported into earlier games and there's the rare treat of real-time reflections. Yay. Dynamic lighting in ME1 is outright broken. The default FOV is an unusable atrocity. NPC appearances range from weird to jarring. Newly broken textures and animations would take an entire page to list. Boo.

Audio: the store page boasts, quote-unquote, ""full-resolution audio"". I don't know how full is it or where that resolution is supposed to be, but sound is consistently bad across all three games. Volume levels are wildly inconsistent. Dialogue gets randomly cut off. Lip sync occasionally fails. An entire subset of enemies in ME2 is missing *all* of their audio - it's not just a missed reference, the audio files themselves are outright gone. Hammerhead's objective pickup buzzer is changed to what can be charitably described as screams of the damned.

Technical: to begin with, the game breaks achievements if you don't jump through the hoops to launch it through an outdated version of Origin. Even if it didn't do that, the ""new"" and ""improved"" EA Play launcher can refuse to work for months at a time due to circumstances likely related to the movement of stars. The game's own launcher, as if it needed another one, is inexplicably DX12-only despite the games themselves requiring nothing of the sort. FPS drops and momentary freezes are annoyingly common despite running on hardware ahead of the game's requirements by several generations.

The ME2 bug with slotting abilities into the quickbar that annoyed me back in 2010 is *still* in the game and occasionally crashes it just like the original. Camera randomly breaks in ME1 and locks you into one direction. Pinnacle Station is gone - not that anyone would miss it, but the fact that modders brought it back without access to the source code calls Bioware's competence into question. No such luck for ME3's multiplayer, which was once considered the major draw of the game.

Thankfully, a lot of these can be fixed with unofficial patches and mods. A lot more exist in the base game that I haven't noticed thanks to said patches and mods. When all the hoops have been jumped through, it's still a Mass Effect experience, but given its persistent attempts to resist providing that experience, I too recommend resisting buying it unless it's at least -75% off on a sale.",1684420224,1684421411,False,33,1,0.7424049973487854,0,True,False,False

This is the ultimate sci-fi story. This is an epic story that spans 3 games. The story is fantastic throughout all 3 games, even as the game play changes significantly; for the better. The Legendary edition updates the graphics and game play to be a bit more modern. It does a pretty good job at this. I am replaying through the whole series now.  
ME1 (hardcore)
This game looks totally different. The graphics are so much better. The first time I went through this game I didn't enjoy anything but the story because it was dated. The legendary version is much more playable and I am enjoying everything about it. The combat is not as good as modern games, but that is to be expected. I was still able to enjoy the combat. It took me 18 hours to beat ME1 on hardcore. This seems like the right setting. It is difficult, but not crazy bullet sponge difficult. I was worried that my memories of this game were rose colored, but it turns out that it really is just a great game.

ME2 (hardcore)

Graphics are ok. The story telling and world building is fantastic. So many beautiful worlds and cities to check out. The world feels huge even though the actual playable size is quite small. I never get lost or dont know where to go next, but it doesnt feel on rails. The gameplay is fun. Interesting powers and the difficulty is fair and even. It is mostly a cover based shooter, with small amount of tactics thrown in. Every mission adds to the story and world building in significant ways. There is so much lore and interesting concepts in this game. The team of people you can build in ME2 is great. Well built cast of characters that you care about. I woudnt say mass effect 2 is the best at anything, but it does really well on all aspects of gaming, which makes it a fantastic game.

Even when there's some troubles with achievements I can't leave my favorite RPG/space opera trilogy with negative review. It just doesn't feel right.

To fix achievements of ME2 and ME3 you have to use EA app in offline mode before selecting game (in Mass Effect launcher game select menu). However be advised that single launch of game with app in online mode can break achievements. EA ligma balls you band of fucking morons.

Here's a short guide that explains it pretty easily: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1328670/discussions/0/3770112515484435342/

If anyone is wondering if the game still holds up in 2023 - it does. Games like Mass Effect are unique, it was developed in golden times of Bioware when they still knew how to make perfect RPGs.

Mass Effect has it all, great story, immersive soundtrack, awesome dialogues and companions that you grow attached to (Mordin, Garrus and Wrex, I love you guys). I have played the OG trilogy and replaying it on LE was amazing, especially when it comes to ME1. It looks great!

Amount of mods that is available fixes a lot of bugs and adds new things making it perfect, tailored experience.
If you are into RPGs you should play it, there's no game that can match Mass Effect trilogy when it comes to telling story. I loved every minute I have spent with it. Looking forward to Mass Effect 4, I hope they can deliver!",1680381768,1684369970,True,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This is unacceptable, so concerning the EA app, the only thing I can say is may its woes be many and its days few.)

The Mass Effect Trilogy, is simply put, one of the greatest experiences I've ever had the pleasure to, well, experience. It's one of the most captivating, detailed and passionately created worlds and stories I've ever seen, with the closest comparison I can make being Sci-Fi Game of Thrones. Perhaps not as realistically explicit, but similar themes, of morality vs reality, honor and dishonor, and leadership and camaraderie and choices, and the paths they lead down, and so much more. The writing is phenomenal, and there are so many lines permanently branded into my memory. I wish my English literature degree I am currently working through could help me become as eloquent as I would want to be, to be able to reach inside myself and pull out all the emotions and feelings and thoughts that went through my head as I was playing these games, and mold them into language I can give form to, into words that give justice to them. Sadly, I'm about as eloquent as a woodsquirrel, so you will have to forgive me. All I can really tell you is, if you care even in the slightest about storytelling, about the worlds that can be created, and the characters that can jump to life in our imaginations, you owe it to yourself to play these games, like with The Witcher 3, or Red Dead 2, or the Souls games, or Fallout New Vegas. 

I genuinely can't think of the words I want to use to describe what it felt like playing through Mass Effect, what it felt like exploring these vividly textured worlds, these multi-faceted, complex characters I got to know and genuinely love as if they were real people. The choices I made, unaware of the myriad of tiny, and gigantic repercussions that would ripple out from those choices, often came back to haunt me, sometimes immediately, sometimes whole games later, tearing up at more than a few occasions. People tend to criticize Mass Effect 3, and specifically its endings, and while I agree to some extent, and having my own gripes with some of the plot points, the overall experience remained unforgettable. 

I'm probably going to add to these thoughts as they come to me, and come back to this review to add them in, but right now, I'm going to have to leave it at that. The Citadel DLC was absolutely phenomenal too, I just have to add, hellbent on making me either grin, or tear up, or both at every moment, a poignant, heartfelt farewell to one of the greatest series of games I have ever played. Garrus, Tali, Liara, Joker, Thane, Legion, EDI, Mordin, Wrex, Grunt, Jack, and all the others, I will forever remember and cherish these characters and their stories, as cringe as that may sound. I don't give a sh*t.

3:) all achievements can be gotten 100%

 4:) the one thing i don't like is they removed the multiplayer game mode from mass effect 3  

a little tip for mass effect 3 the dlc pistol u get is the strongest gun in the game it makes the hardest difficulty a joke it will melt all the enemies in 1 to 3 head shots",1676116225,1684231345,True,1,0,0,0,True,True,False

It shows how linear role playing at the expense of open world may be better for immersion (sorry new vegas). I have never been more immersed in a series. The lore rivals that of halo and i love it. While the game play leaves much to be desired in 1 and 2 i would say 3 starts to hit around gears 1 level in cover based shooting.

I wont go on too much but to say this is a must grab, especially on sale if you love lore and role playing as this is the top of the market even after a decade, no question. Cant believe i slept on this series

The graphics are quite noticeable in the first game to be re skinned and updated but still have that early bioware style of being mostly empty room this slowly become less noticeable as you go through the series, its a nice touch that they all feel spruced up but certain parts of the game can still feel a bit sparse due to limitations of the games back then. this is more preference but i'd rather play a game truer to the original than have it changed and tweaked to death and random things added this is definitely a remaster of graphics than a lets change things to how we want them now.

The launcher can be a little clunky at times and maybe a little simple, it would be nice to see a little bit more information or options for each game but this is a minor gripe and does not effect game play.",1624374746,1684184795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was most interested in replaying Mass Effect 3, after I purchased the Legendary Edition, as I'd not played it since it was originally released. With the addition of the DLC content, the game is a lot better than I'd remembered. Still, from a narrative perspective, it is probably still the weakest entry in the series. 

The final book, game, or film in any trilogy is always the hardest to get right. You have to somehow tie up all the loose ends in a satisfactory manner, while also bringing the main story to an end in a way that doesn't feel contrived. There are many great moments in Mass Effect 3, and its still a good game, with or without the narrative issues. I'll be interested to see what Mass Effect 4 will bring, though I'll wait till we know what direction Bioware want to take it in.

The Legendary Edition is without a doubt the best way to play these games. The graphical upgrades are nice, though the main draw for me is all the DLC and extra content are bundled in directly, so I got to experience a lot of the cool missions, and many of them are more interesting than the main story content.

Most folks will have likely purchased this long ago, though for anyone who hasn't played Mass Effect, I can thoroughly recommend it. It is true that Mass Effect 1, in terms of the game play, is quite crude when comparing it to Mass Effect 2 & 3, though it is still my personal favourite.

I know a few people complained about the fact you need to download the EA launcher to play this, and I'll admit it did put me off for a long time, though after picking this up on sale, its not much of an issue. If you're really against it, you could always uninstall the EA launcher once you're done with your play throughs.

All in all, to some up these games would require me to write an essay on each game, and it makes more sense to simply play them and make up your own mind as to each games strengths and weaknesses.

The only downside to a series like Mass Effect is that it'll reduce the chances that another games company will create something similar with a new IP, which I would personally love, at some point in the future. 

Mass Effect is up there with Star Wars, Star Trek, Babylon 5, Dune, and many other Sci-Fi classics of our time, and I can't think of any higher praise than that.",1684169231,1684169231,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is just okay and especially as a sniper 3 games in a row can get grating but the story is alright, soundtrack has some bangers, lore is solid, and the main cast is absolutely fantastic throughout the series.
 Quality varies from game to game with ME1 having too much bad land rover and ME3 tripping up the initial jump, doing some super stylish flips while midair, then landing right on their face, but ME2 is just plain good all around. Especially on sale for around 15 bucks, easy recommend if it looks like your kinda thing

Oh yeah but an important note is that the EA Launcher is trash and they should be ashamed. Unable to play without internet, sometimes the game just refuses to turn on, pressing the giant X button only minimizes it instead of closing it so you have to do that from the minimization tab, achievments didn't work for ME2/3, and the saves pretty much never synced for the entirety of ME2/3.

Come back later."" Come back later? Here I am 20 minutes later and still nothing. The FUCKING NERVE. I know no other company that charged me 60 dollars for 15 dollars of game only to tell me ""yo bitch not now come back later"". What a fucking joke this company is.

Sadly, there a couple of issues with the games and launcher. You need to uninstall the EA app and get the old version of Origin to unlock achievements as EA app has achievement progress disabled.
Due to this fact I have to replay the entirety of Mass Effect 2 all over again to regain the achievements it did not allow me to have. 
Not only this but you also have to change the drive that your game is installed on if you have really bad stutters and frame drops. This game is over 100GB, I spent around 15 hours finding out all of this. 

All of this took so long, as there are very long and unskippable cutscenes, many people saying a method worked for them but didn't work for me for some odd reason. Make sure that your game runs fine and you are earning your achievements so that you do not waste as many hours as I have stressing over a stupid fix (ea app sucks).

I DIDNT BUY it on origin or from EA store, so maybe that has something to do with it, maybe not. I m runnning it on Ryzen 7 4800 with a basic rtx 3050(4gb).

As for the game, one of the greatest storyline you'll ever experience, so I recommend it. Multiple classes which significantly change the gameplay, for both genders, means each playthrough can be different from a previous one and not completely dull and repetitive. So, great replay value for as well, once you finish. 

Highly recommended!

EDIT :
 Ran into the achievements bug as soon as I lanuched ME2. Checked online and saw multiple reports, complaints, discussions on EA official forums and nothing, no fix. 
Really dick move EA.
 You are actively encouraging folks to pirate games, achievements and more importantly offical acknowledgements on concerns raised, are very important factors that motivate people to buy Original copies in addition to supporting the devs of course. But if the achievements are not working correctly, and I am just supposed to play the game then why pay and play, why should one not pirate? Very annoying issue, please fix this.
The only solution was provided by a kind stranger who said to turn off the internet after launching mass effect launcher and before launching Me2. Then delete the gamerprofile in me2 save folder in ""my documents"" , linked to achievements. Then launch me 2 and start a fresh new game to create new gamerprofile and complete achievements as you go. Later on steam and EA sync up with this untouched FILE and achievements show up.

I wish they had a little wavy ""meh/so-so"" hand in addition to thumb's up and down options.
Since, IMO, graphics are the least important part of a game, unless terribly broken, I haven't gotten a lot out of this vs the originals.
I had hoped that the ME1 UI -- inventory and interaction with vendors -- had improved, but it's still bad enough to make me very unlikely to play it again.  The UI can be used in classes as an example of how *NOT* to make a UI.

If you are using EA app and not using mods to fix bugs please don't play ME2 on insanity. The cover system barely functions well enough to make the game playable. Ultimately you'll shoot multiple rounds from the same position but the second hit will shoot directly into the cover in front of you. When peeking there will be times when your gun just doesn't fire. Many times you will find yourself unable to peek from cover that you were just peeking from a moment ago. Sometimes you will run into cover only for it to stagger you as if you have been hit by biotics. Moving from cover to cover has been streamlined for Mass Effect 2 but ultimately it is inferior to Mass Effect's cover system in every other way because 70% of it wasn't play tested for bugs. Don't even get me started on the Shadow Broker DLC with its plants on top of most of the cover. Plants that the enemies can shoot through but can also apparently stop your super heated plasma rounds.

The story, from 2010, holds up I just wish they'd have done more than just make it prettier for a ""Legendary"" edition.

I wasn't one that played Mass Effect when it originally released.  I played a bit of ME2, not very far in, but I didn't have any context for the game.  I bought the Legendary Edition when it released because I knew I was missing out on a great trilogy, I just didn't know how great.  ME1 is the perfect entry point for the series.  The gameplay mechanics are a little dated, but it still holds up well.  The main story isn't overly complicated, but the lore is fascinating and draws you in completely from the first mission.  There's so much to learn about this universe, I found myself reliving when I fell in love with Star Wars and learning all about the extended universe when I was a kid.

I'm incredibly drawn to the Quarian species.  For example, in between mission when you go to speak with Tali, she complains about how she can't sleep because it's too quiet.  Her kind living on the Flotilla among the stars, basically starships patched together for centuries.  She complains that it's too quiet, because when it's quiet on the Flotilla that means an engine went out, or the environmental scrubbers malfunctioned.  Too quiet means potentially fatal problems for the entire crew.  It's a short exchange but it's small details like that, that reveal the care the original Bioware team put in to developing these different species cultures and making them feel ""real."" They really put themselves into the perspective of what it would be like to live on the Flotilla, what kind of problems would arise, how would they feel in a different setting outside their comfort zone.  Like a living part of the universe you're traveling.  That's just one of many examples like that.

ME2 is without question the greatest of the trilogy.  After playing through ME1 and going straight into ME2, the quality of life changes to the combat systems and game mechanics feel incredible. They simplified the skill system in a very meaningful way that doesn't take away from the game. The story is absolutely epic, the roleplay elements feel significant, the romance options (Tali's my girl) feel vulnerable, and every story told has so much more depth to it.  Like Miranda telling you early on she's genetically modified but then later discovering what that really means to her.  The paragon and renegade system feels much more substantial in ME2 with different species reacting differently to them based on their culture, their individual personalities, and context in which they apply.  Yes in my humble opinion, Mass Effect 2 is without question one of the greatest games I've ever played.

Finally to sum it up with ME3.  Bioware really learned from their experience with ME2 and improved upon the gameplay mechanics once again. There's not much to say about how it changed except the overall feel and pacing of the action.  I do think the gameplay and combat reached it's peak in ME3, while the story peaked in ME2.  That's not to say the story isn't good in ME3 as well, but how do you follow up a nearly perfect entry?  There was almost no way in which the story of ME3 could exceed ME2.  Because of that, I did feel slightly disappointed in the ending of ME3, but I enjoyed my time with it nonetheless.

Overall, these games are an amazing piece of storytelling in which the player crafts the outcome.  There are many games since that have used this style where the ending is decided by the player's actions and decisions I.e. role playing, but I don't think any of them truly come close to recreating the grandeur of the Mass Effect trilogy.  Yes, I do see myself coming back to replay them many times for many years to come.",1683502622,1683502622,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are stability issues in ME 1, but this was one of the best gaming experience I've had this year. If you don't mind the lack of achievements unlocking, play it! I loved the experience, but can't recommend because achievements are broken.

The meat of my issues:

While playing the first game I had one of the best experiences playing a video game in recent months, I had previously played mass effect two when it originally came out, but hadn't play ME 1 or 3 so this edition was a perfect re-introduction to the series for me HOWEVER. 

The EA launcher, that this game requires to play has made the experience DRASTICALLY worse. Aside from significant stability issues that caused me to be near constantly saving throughout the first game, the launcher has made launching the game a hassle and only seems to have added downsides with no upside.

My biggest grip with the game -- and I want to note my only real gripe with this game as aside from stability it was one of the best experiences I've had in a long time -- is that Achievements are completely bugged out for ME 2 and 3, with no way to acquire them at this time. The kicker to this is that there's no way to know this UNTIL you finish the first game and start ME 2 only to realize that the achievements should be unlocking and aren't. Which for me started a lengthy dive down a google and forum rabbit hole only to find that after the sunsetting of origin, there's no way to unlock achievements in 2/3 of this game reliably. But, once you find that, most of us will be outside of the return window having played the entirety of the first game to get to this point.

Thus, I just can't recommend this game while this bug persists, as it means that a major, advertised feature of this game is fundamentally broken for 2/3 of the video game. And, from various forum posts and comments made by EA it appears there's no interest in fixing this problem. It's really irritating that a game that came out just over 2 years ago has this fundamental of a flaw. I think that steam should remove the achievements as advertised from the game's listing unless this bug is fixed.

It's really unfortunate that a game I was truly enjoying had such a fundamental flow in it. Sure, I got my ""money's worth"" and I can't return the game, but it's not the point. My experience is marred because EA refuses to play ball and fix the game. I'm irritated because I bought the game thinking it had achievements and it didn't so one of the fundamental ways that I relate to playing video games recently is broken in this game.",1683401046,1683401046,False,3,1,0.528920471668243408,0,True,False,False

Even if its a bit dated, the first game was fantastic. So many meaningful choices and decisions put you right in the drivers seat of handling every tense moment. The story was a fun ride of a race against time to stop the evil from accomplishing their goals. The companions were great and really felt like actual characters instead of cardboard cutouts. I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish and loved the 30 or so hours I put in to do every side quest and task. 

Mass Effect 2 felt like a step up in nearly every way from the first. The gameplay felt smoother, the character moments felt better and while I felt the main story of 1 was a little more engaging, the climax of 2 was off the charts in terms of stress, decision making and edge of your seat action. I don't think I have been as glued to the screen, so afraid to make the wrong decision as I did at the end of the game with how much decisions mattered. It was really cool to see a game really push the envelope of making the player feel the consequences and rewards of every decision they made. 

Despite all the issues with 3s ending, the journey of Mass Effect 3 might be my favorite of the 3. Packed full of emotions and heavy decisions, it really felt like the series was wrapping up with a perfect bow. It felt like it was going to be the best way of ending an 80 hour long journey through the franchise, but unfortunately it fell flat in doing so. Despite that, I still absolutely loved it. The gameplay was fun, the characters were still great as always and the Citadel DLC was a great moment before finishing that really made me look back and say ""man what a fun ride its been"". 

All 3 games had their flaws at various points, but I can say without a doubt this franchise was one of my favorite gaming experiences I have had in some time.

You will miss out on the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, but it makes up for it by rebalancing so you dont need multiplayer etc to max war assets.

None of the games are perfect, but all are easily worth your time and money.  However, EA is a horrible company who can't support even their best franchises.  At the time of writing, the achievements in 2 out of 3 of the games don't work because EA forced everyone to migrate to the EA app.  I have to give a negative overall rating because of that.  However, the games themselves are very good, and if you don't mind giving money to an incompetent and arguably evil company, read on.

Mass Effect 1 is an unfocused and overly ambitious game.  The inventory system is somewhat tedious, and the Uncharted Planets gameplay is fairly uninspired.  However, everything else about the game is amazing.  The story and dialog are some of the best in any RPG, as long as you understand that unlike many western RPGs, you're more inhabiting a set character than trying to totally build your own in Commander Shepard.  The Legendary edition has completely transformed the gunplay from rather poor in the original to above average.  The RPG mechanics as you level up your character and unlock and upgrade new powers is a little overly detailed, but quite understandable once you've had some time to learn it. Overall its an immensely fun game to get lost in the worldbuilding of.  

Mass Effect 2 is an improvement in almost every way on Mass Effect's strengths.  The shooting is tighter, and the story is more personal.  The interrupt system makes dialog go from very good to cinematic and probably the most fun I've had in an action RPG.  There are only two missteps in my opinion.  The RPG mechanics are extremely stripped down, especially on your squad-mates. And it seems like they were unable to come up with any way of making planet exploration enjoyable, so they just replaced it with a scanning minigame.  A DLC included in this bundle does add Vehicle combat, but its very stripped down and only usable in a very small amount of content.  It's not really an improvement on ME1 due to that.  But, what you're left with is a sequel to Mass Effect that was arguably even better than the original when it came out.  The massive improvements to ME1's shooting makes the gap a good deal smaller in this bundle, but ME2 is still one of the best action RPGs of all time.  Also you can romance more aliens in this one so that also scores it more points. 

Mass Effect 3 is the hardest to rate objectively in my opinion.  In most ways it is clearly the best game.  The shooting mechanics and RPG mechanics find their best form here.  For 90% of the game the story is as strong as its ever been, and many of the characters and story ideas get excellent endings that tie everything up greatly.  But on the other hand, this game has the worst flaws.  Turret sections.  Most Dialog gives few branching options, generally just 2 choices.  There's really no exploration mechanic at all.  And the Act 3 ending to the whole story is just a massive flop.  90% of the game is amazing.  10% is the worst of the whole series.  It makes it very hard to give a definite rating.  The obvious struggle the devs had to actually give the series a strong ending is clear.  They obviously worked very hard, but they did not stick the landing.  Sucks, but it is what it is.  Still well worth playing, and honestly the ending, as bad as it is, is rather iconic and worth experiencing so you can understand an important moment in the history of RPGs.  If you played ME1 and 2 I'd recommend it.",1682717122,1682717122,False,2,0,0.555151224136352539,0,True,False,False

The creativity behind the building of this galaxy places, stories, races and people (and even the technical background for every practical aspect of these advanced-technology based relations) cannot be overmeasured at any rate. 

The Mass Effect main trilogy (let's leave Andromeda sided for now) presents not only a remarkable sci-fi story, but it is also an learning experience about friendship, relationships, understanding new cultures and different points of views. It's a game about making choices that could affect everyone around you, and the consequences will be felt throughout the three games, whether good or not.

I really advise you to play the three games very slowly, following its pace. Enjoy the dialogues, the adventures, and dive into this rich universe. Try yourself to explore every conversation, every mission available and everything that the three games offer, you'll not regret it. 

I must say, however, that EA support on this game is really poor and unoptmized. The main issue as of today (04/22/2023) is the blocked achievement unlocking on steam, caused by a bug stemmed from EA App bad programming. This bug prevents you from unlocking ME2 and ME3 achievements, as they're already unlocked in-game, tricking Steam to consider that if they're already obtained in the game, the player already has the achievement.

[b]TL;DR: [/b] Everyone should play this trilogy and the legendary edition is a perfect bundle for these games. It is not without flaw, but far and away one of the most fun, engaging, and fulfilling gaming experiences of my entire life (as a life long avid enjoyer of games of all genres).

[b]Full Review[/b]
To dive into more details The Legendary edition is essentially just a wrapper around all three Mass Effect games and their DLCs all included in one purchase. It took me nearly 150 hours to play through the whole thing. Most of that 150 hours is without any grinding or useless filler. It's all story and missions all the time. I meant it when I said this is a very engaging game. It's massive, gorgeous, and the amount of work and effort put into it is unrivaled in it's genre. While you do have the ability to go off and grind extra money and resources, and there are ample side missions throughout all the games they are mostly optional even for a perfect ending. And not much of my time was spent on side missions or grinding.

The best part of this game is the story. It connects through all three games and all DLCs. But not just loosely, if you're here you may have heard that the decisions made change the next game and everything is connected. But the extent to which this is true was beyond what I thought anyone would attempt. A character in the first game dying will change the story in the next two games. Decisions made long ago will come back to help or haunt you. Every person you save or kill, it all matters. 

Beyond being connected, these games do something I didn't expect. They refused to let that connection limit the story. A character you let die could have been a main character in the final game, and you'd never know because the story is that extensive. It's a very well written story with some of the best characters and lore I've ever seen. I will, for quite some time, remember not just this game and story, but the personalities of my crewmates and the jokes they made and the people we lost along the way. Most movies and books don't have the level of characters development and motivation the Mass Effect series has. 

Now, up until now I've done nothing but praise the game, and it deserves every second of that praise. But there are two ""Negatives"" I want to discuss. The first being one I personally found, and the second being the one everyone talks about.

[b]Negative #1[/b] - Mass Effect 1 is the oldest and most flawed of the games. It still has the amazing story, world, and characters, but it falls flat in two areas, the combat is a bit clunky, and the only real grind in this entire series is in the first game. The number of side missions and their lack or importance can hit a bit hard here. I found a solution though. Follow a guide for mission order and importance. You can skip most of the useless side stuff and only do the side missions that effect future games. Those side missions still are my least favorite part, and please, please, please, don't give up here. I did for a month before I tried again. I'm so glad I pushed through it. I won't post links, but I used the ""SUGGESTED MISSION ORDER GUIDE"" on gamespot. Highly recommend that guide.

[b]Negative #2[/b] Mass Effect 3's ending is not nearly as bad as I think people make it out to be. It is definitely not perfect, but this game is not all sunshine and rainbows (I cried multiple times) and you will simply not get through the games without loss. Accept that now, and know that the Universe is a harsh place and there is no 100% happy ending and sometimes there are just not as many choices as you want there to be. If you take that to heart you will finish the game if not happy but content with the ending.

[b]Final Words of Advice:[/b]
Enjoy ME1's story and world building, use a guide to cut out the unnecessary side stuff. Enjoy ME2 as it is a masterpiece all the way through, fixing and improving on every part of the first game. Finally, Enjoy ME3, (controversial opinion perhaps) I liked this game even more than the second one. The arcs conclude in epic fashion and you will have the highlights of the story. Don't skip out on getting to know your crew, Mass Effect is driven by it's characters, and nearly all of them are worth knowing.

First of all, I think too many people expected this to be a full on remake where all three games are completely different, the ending for ME3 is entirely re-written, and they get a free life sized android of Miranda to come suck them off while they play. This is not the case. The legendary edition is [i]just a remaster, it was meant to touch up the graphics and gameplay and modernize the overall experience of the trilogy for current audiences to enjoy, and neither Bioware nor EA ever advertised this to be anything but that.[/i]

The things that I really like so far about it is the gameplay, especially. Gunplay feels so much smoother and less clunky, things like the shaky sniper rifle is fixed, the UI looks a lot nicer and cleaner, and you can now sprint at any time, not just in combat, which is a godsend for going around the Citadel for side quests. The new graphics also look great in my opinion, so many textures were touched up and look so much nicer than in the original version, I don't like some of the lighting changes but it doesn't take away from the experience at all and is really a negligible complaint on my part.

Is it perfect? No, there's a few issues that me and other people are annoyed by. The negative mouse acceleration is absolutely atrocious, I started playing with a controller because it annoyed me that much, and there is no way to fix it. There's also no way to change the nauseatingly low FOV, although there is already a few mods that let you change it so I recommend people who hate low FOV to go find that ASAP. I know people are also complaining about the lackluster ultrawide support, but I'm pretty sure something like <1% of people on Steam have an ultrawide monitor so odds are it wouldn't be an issue for most of you.

Overall, I am really enjoying this remaster for one of my all time favorite game series. I think if you're willing to put up with the minor issues I mentioned, you'd absolutely love these games, whether you're a new fan or old. Gameplay aside, the story and characters of this trilogy are phenomenal, those things along with the atmosphere and world building will easily draw you in, even if the gameplay and other issues don't.

On the one hand, a lot has been done to improve the experience in some areas. The Legendary version of ME1 is like playing a new game. The graphics, audio and gameplay has been almost completely reworked, resulting in a much more engaging game from the 2007 version. It might be worth buying this package just for the work done on that game alone.

The same cannot be said for ME2 and 3. Its not zero, but little has been done to improve the gameplay, graphics etc. of the Mass Effect sequels. So you're pretty much buying a more expensive 2nd and 3rd game without any significant changes.

Its also 96gbs. The Legendary edition does include all the DLC, so that might make it worth it for some. But for me, that file size just felt insane and little to nothing can be deleted to reduce it without breaking the game. 

EA play is also required. I don't share the hate for EA play that others have, but its still an extra 520mb of bloatware on your computer, has corrupted code that prevents you from getting achievements in ME2 or 3 and forces you to always be online to play the game. So its not great.

Still, I can't bring myself to flip this review negative. I was having fun a lot of the time and that's what matters in the end. If you're a fan or never played before, the Legendary edition is worth it. But wait for the game to drop to $30 or below. Its not worth $60.",1682278000,1682278106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But after playing ME1 again and then going into ME2, only having 2 weapons (unless soldier class), losing 90% of weapon customization, forced global cool-down instead of individual ability cool-downs makes it so that I have to AFK behind cover and fight things in waves, it also means that the AI followers will be less useful, and then to top that off the enemy AI almost always target you instead of any companions, they prefire, they shoot before they are fully out of cover and aiming their weapons, can even shoot homing rockets from some enemies through the cover they are hiding behind (fun), forced installation of AI on my ship, changed the star map so you physically move the ship between planets but just adds 2x the amount of time and effort for the same outcome, the cover system now requires 2 buttons to be pressed to enter cover, your followers use their abilities from your perspective and will hit random objects next to where you are aiming with their powers, all weapons use ammo (scarce resource) instead of heat (what? how? why?) when the 2nd game takes place 2 years after the first one...

TLDR: The second game feels like it was the first game, and the first game feels like it was the second game, I don't know why they would add all these terrible changes. Glad I didn't play these games back to back as a child because I definitely wouldn't have enjoyed them in the same way.

Going to revise and compare when I finish ME3 again, feel free to comment anything constructive on ME2's gameplay/changes/etc

ME2 becomes playable about half way through the game when you get enough talent points to have useful skills. Even with a nearly max level character from ME1 transferred the game felt so off in comparison to how the first game felt. ME3 adds a bunch of elements back in from ME1... Except in ME3 you still get forced down to peon level after getting kicked in the shins in ME2. ME1 gave you all of the power to play the game how you wanted. Makes no sense how backwards these games are. Some areas of these newer games look worse than ME1. Running animation, dodging is useless and causes more problems than it fixes (especially when it happens constantly trying to maneuver your character like normal but because you for some reason cant strafe it dodge rolls instead?) Ashley in ME3 makes me regret saving her instead of Kaidan, and arguably looks worse in ME3. 

They added the ability to use more than 2 weapons again, but selecting a weapon in an empty weapon slot uses skill recharge time, up to nearly 100% addition in cooldown by equipping one weapon. You still have global cooldown which means you have to wait about 2 seconds to cast your secondary skill that you would use for detonation, causing the gameplay to feel turn based and waiting on skills instead of in ME1 where you use your skills so they go on cooldown then you use your selection of weapons and mods to play the fight out from there how you want. Now it's just sit and wait constantly. AI auto lock on you way harder, have less shielded enemies or armored enemies to start so you have no real damage type advantage over the just high HP enemies instead. Makes abilities and gameplay way more bland. They also added shield enemies that are somehow planted in the ground and are unmovable objects. You can hit them with a singularity and they don't care, you can hit them with a 1000 force Throw and they just act like they were hit with a ball of cotton candy. Terrible. Awful. Sad.

It's really sad to realize how poorly influenced such a well known game series actually is if you analyze it a second time. I can't imagine what these players were saying to the devs in between games to influence such terrible changes.

Also just the cherry on top, you can't run the game (ME3) higher than 60 FPS locked because your shield on your character wont recharge (fun!). 

""Legendary Edition"" seems to only really mean ME1 is Legendary. This kind of reminds me of CoD getting worse and worse as they go, Diablo getting worse after 2, Battlefield series falling apart at Battlefield 2, FarCry goes from FarCry 2 (legendary), FarCry 3 (arguably the most favorite amongst others), (FarCry Blood Dragon was released in between these games but nobody acknowledges its existence as it isn't worth the $3 it is sold for), FarCry 4 (God-Like), FarCry Primal (feels like an entire different series and ties for second place), then they start falling down a very steep tall hill into FarCry 5, New Dawn, and 6 where it's not even remotely the same and is sad to see as a fan. 

I think I would rather have companies release the same game with new content and graphics, maybe some extra options to change to your liking, stuff that could really be a DLC, or simply just do it how Dying Light did it with the Following. Don't jump ahead like they did in Dying Light 2 and ruin everything.

Tying mass & structure of space-time into magic'esque powers makes certain sense, given this whole Higgs biz. The writing style is classical fantasy, I don't mind though. It's a [url=store.steampowered.com/app/208580]space opera[/url] after all, not [url=www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854]hard SciFi[/url]. Speaking of which, a spacious orchestral score goes well with exploring a spacious, stunningly designed space station. The strong visual style very much works in its favor.

I don't really care about the powers anyway, a bunch of cooldown-based hotkeys doesn't cut it from a gameplay perspective so I ended up treating it as a tacltical'ish third-person shooter (with my team throwing in abilities on their own volition, always love self-reliant squadmates). [url=steamcommunity.com/id/reboot/recommended]If you know me[/url], you know I like dem shotguns chonky and this one is dang good by TPS standards!

[url=store.steampowered.com/app/1041720]Some dialog options here and there[/url], leading to the same result albeit giving you a different kind of serial episode to watch. Please don't take the last one as a complaint, the dialogs are really well-written, well-acted, well-watchable! Too bad they nuked speech skills in ME2.

What it does good, are consequences. RPGs win a lot if [url=store.steampowered.com/app/367500]something you did a couple hours (and maybe years in-universe) comes back to remind you[/url] and that's what this one really going for. Does it good too, make no mistake, I just wish there was a wider in-quest decision tree. The stories themselves, on the other hand, are certainly worth it! Rich writing all around, going someplace and then getting lost in a lil' side-story is what I play RPGs for! Another RPG quality it has is to remind you every now and then what you did a couple hours (or years, in-universe) before, to remind you that this is a cohesive world with a cohesive narrative.

I don't mind the Mako sequences either. Humping around some distant backwater hellhole makes perfect sense within the in-game universe and I really dig connections between gameplay & lore. I also dig finding some side-quest-relevant tidbit in a hidden place in some remote hellhole. I don't dig Mercury though, meaning I don't dig ""quests"" of the brand ""do menial A X times"" and ""do menial B Y times"" and... Not an open-world game in a classical sense, it does commit yer olde classical open-world sin of filling the quest log with surrogate daily jobs (I'd quit on the spot though if my real job was so menial).

To its credit, optional parts are optional. I still fault it for leaning heavily on the cinematic side of things. On the flipside, this one's a good fit for GUI.

Rating: 2/5 Stars

While the Mass Effect Trilogy initially showed great promise, it ultimately became a massive disappointment, particularly with the release of Mass Effect 3. The game's narrative took a backseat to the developers' apparent desire to push a strong emphasis on LGBTQ+ representation and the ""strong woman"" trope.

Shepard, once a powerful and respected protagonist, is reduced to a shell of his former self, taking orders from everyone and losing his edge. The storyline involving Jack's transformation from a psychopath in Mass Effect 2 to a reformed teacher in the third installment feels forced and unrealistic.

The writing quality in Mass Effect 3 pales in comparison to the first two games, making it seem as though it was penned by an inexperienced intern with a power fantasy. The original developers' departure from BioWare and the subsequent push for diversity and inclusion have significantly impacted the game's overall quality.

Additionally, the first game has technical issues with sound, including missing surround sound and imbalanced audio levels. A workaround is available, but it results in further complications.

As for Mass Effect Andromeda, it's best to steer clear of that title, as it only adds to the disappointment of the series.

In conclusion, the Mass Effect Trilogy has become a frustrating and ideologically-driven experience that fails to deliver the captivating storytelling and engaging gameplay that fans once loved. It's best to avoid this series and seek out games that prioritize the player's experience over political agendas.

PS: ME1 -->Missing Surround sound . All sound channel are messed up in stereo , gun too loud , voice too low . There is a hack to override some OpenAL.dll but this makes front channel dead .

PS2: Dont get me even started on Mass Effect Andromeda . That game is vomit inducing",1631657759,1682111686,False,9,3,0.428174972534179688,0,True,False,False

WARNING: This is a thumb up review. However, the EA launcher is f'n horrible, and so bad, I am sorely tempted to change my thumb up to a thumb down. Over the years, various ""launchers"" have been added to Mass Effect. First Origin. Now EA has to launch Origin which launches the stupid program. At this point I feel like cracking the game I paid for just because it is such a pain to launch it. Buyer Beware. It is a fantastic game. But everyone wants to put their stupid grubby little stamp on it and force you to install their inferior game store.
***************************************************
This is a no-spoiler review. I may make grand general statements about the game, and I may even refer to some events in the game, but not enough to spoil any major stuff.

This is the best story-game I have ever played, by MILES. The story is so good, I've played through the whole trilogy multiple times as both male and female Shepard, and I'm about to do it again. It's just incredibly immersive and deep. 

Your choices don't matter as much as they hype it, but they DO matter, and have some affect on the story. But even though the choices don't have a huge impact, it still feels very much like the NPCs in the game are referring to your character and their choices. There are thousands of tiny little lines of dialogue that are done in multiple ways depending on what you did in the past. 

And the epic scale of the story, and the lore you discover along the way, all pays off tremendously. The Ending.... let's talk about the ending. A lot of people hated it. But I loved it. It was every bit as grand and amazing and dramatic and majestic in scale as it needed to be. Some found it bittersweet. But it's the ending the game needed. The game tells you how it has to end. From the very beginning. You complainers all just didn't listen. :)

The only other game that comes close to this in terms of story and emotion is Red Dead Redemption 2. It's great, but it's 1/3 of the length. I hope RDR3 is coming soon. I tried RDR1 but just couldn't get into it.

Not a bad game if you like the story but at 80$ it's one hell of a cash grab that EA has ruined since it's achievements don't even work anymore

don't buy this game if you are an achievement hunter

&#@ the EA App. Absolutely garbage launcher that breaks playing this game across more than 2 devices (RIP if you have a Steam Deck). You'll be forced to constantly manually transfer save files as this thing will do it 1 out of every 10 times if you're lucky once it bugs.

Oh and I earned 0 achievements for Mass Effect 2. It just completely stopped working entirely, so that's... fun? For people who are completionists, this is a huge slap in the face. I can't be bothered to replay 20+ hours for that to be fixed.
