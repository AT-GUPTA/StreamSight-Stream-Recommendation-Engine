Last Light's main attraction, the campaign, holds an uneven tale that varies from clichéd to thrilling, but it chiefly favours the middle ground of these two. The first half to 3 quarters of the story lacks the startling originality and intense, desolate air 2033 portrayed to remarkable effects; but with the gritty and grimy ambiance used as a crutch, Last Light stays above water and carries the player through with few articulate qualms save the dated AI and unabashed exposition present in almost every encounter. It is when we reach the final act in Last Light that things begin to crack and crumble. A rushed conclusion pooled with little climax creates a palpable sense of disheartenment, as if our long, winding journey towards this heavily anticipated finale was a waste of time. Alas, this disappointment is what I ultimately walked away from Last Light with; a spasmodically engrossing but stilted phase in the Metro series. 

Gunplay and environments are barely worth mentioning as they follow the same archetypal structure of their predecessor, but with slightly improved graphics caked over the top. The main resonating feature in Last Light is sadly displeasure -- but then again, it would be a miracle for this game to even come close to the staggering uniqueness and darkness that Metro 2033 was best known for.

U need a powerful pc to run it right. got to a stage where i have to save a guy and was to crawl thru a vent system, from there on the game was stalling and jerking and was unplayable. tried to restart pc and so on. but when reload the game it was the same so in 1 sense i am glad i only paid £6 for this because if it was £20 i would be annoyed seriously.

my specs are a Quad Core AMD 2.2ghz with 6 gig ram. and a Geforce 260 gtx. which seems to be not enough even on low graphics.

Alias known as Metro 2034; the sequel of Metro 2033. Having played Metro 2033, I can say I was looking forward to this creepy post apocalyptic journey. This game takes the Ranger ending from 2033 as canonical and continues on the journey of Artyom. I found the game sort of easier than 2033 by having more resources spread out on levels and also, found the game to be much longer than 2033. Took me some 10-ish hours to complete the game and to my sadness, got the bad ending! The game is very unforgiving with its moral system so you really have to skip killing any human / mutant that can be avoided and seems I did not!


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Atmosphere fills you with dread, very depressive!
+Fantastic touching story about loss and hope
+Impressive graphics to this detailed world
+Tension is well built before the action heats up
+Frantic and frightening surface exploration!
+Many weapons and mods.
+Improves about every aspect of Metro 2033, mainly the gameplay![/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-Invisible walls and very linear at areas.
-Unimpressive AI
-Occasionally drab visuals and performance jitters.
-Little to no backstory for newcomers; meaning, PLAY Metro 2033 before Last Light... or go read WIKI and buy the game later!
-Ranger Mode as DLC or included if you've pre-ordered... I mean, c'mon!
-Some boss fights aren't really clear about ""where to shoot"" and even simply ,""what to do"".[/b]


[h1]OVERALL & RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]Metro: Last Light is a sequel, and as such it expects a certain amount of previous knowledge of the story and its characters. For a twisted tale like that of Metro, that becomes a problem if you decided to sit the first game out. If you skipped 2033, either go back and play it or, at the very least, find a detailed plot summary online and educate yourself before diving into Last Light.

While the game is longer than its predecessor, I'd wish a Metro game where it would be MORE OPEN, like exploring the whole metro system and, having some hot spots to explore on the surface. In fact, I'd wish the Metro franchise get's the ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R."" treatment someday![/b]",1369196339,1674240975,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This one goes a lot more political and ideological instead of being an introspection. The game deviated from the second book and I believe that was the best choice. The game has its own story now and it has its own take on the Metro series which I really do enjoy.
The graphics were improved as well as the physics. They were amazing for their time. I remember looking for everything and anything Metro Last Light related before the release of this game. So when it released I put my laptop to work. The torrent was already seeding after a few hours and the game was working perfectly. After experiencing the intro I knew this game was going to be a wild ride. And so it was.
This game has a linear story with few decisions to make that add to the all to familiar karma system. Based on that system you will either get the good or bad ending. A lot happens in this story and I will not spoil anything but I will say that the game starts off after the events of the 1st game with a very small time skip. Many things are foreshadowed in the 1st level alone. You are supposed to find and kill the last remaining enemy from the 1st game. Most of the game is you trying to do just that and a lot of complications happen in-between. These complications range from personal to political (inner world struggles between the factions). The ending left me in tears.
The game also has a lot of memorable soundtracks that invoke a lot of emotion during segments of the game. Even parts with you being on the surface have some soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere and tone quite a bit. The sound effects are great as well.
Finally after the game you have bonus missions from all factions. They are quite interesting and add to the worldbuilding. They also differ in tone - some are action focused, others are stealth or exploration focused.

Overall this game means a lot to me and since it is pulled from the store in its original form and returned only via the Redux edition it saddens me. Not because the Redux is bad, but because this original vision of the game is now unavailable and everyone will from now on firstly experience the Redux versions. Get this one via a torrent or play it on a Xbox360 or PS3 since they are still being sold there if you want to experience the Original Last Light.",1656989491,1656990113,True,3,0,0.543726265430450439,0,True,False,False

Last Light was such a great experience. You can choose your own playstyle in human areas; you can progress through zones non-lethally with stealth or get into very heavy gun fights. The outside word offers it's own challenge of survival with the mutated beasts, managing your air filters and radiation poisoning. I very rarely suggest starting with a harder difficulty, but in Last Light it gives you a very immersive post-apocalyptic experience. The harder difficulties makes the setting feel more natural, as finding less resources feels somewhat more accurate. I found that the normal difficulty was a bit too easy, but great if you want to just play through the story. The harder settings make scavenging more valuable, which suited my playstyle more. The weapon design feels very unique; weapons are generally crafted and salvaged so their designs and concepts fit the post-apocalyptic setting. I thought the story was okay; there is one twist and it's heavily foreshadowed, but the majority of the story is simple to follow and you can get additional insight if you pick up the diary entries scattered across the levels. The world building, even though I have mentioned quite a bit of it already, is the best selling point of the game. The other best selling point is obviously the Theater. 

[h1]Sequel Improvements[/h1]
Last Light follows it's own unique story set after the ""bad"" ending of Metro 2033. I strongly suggest to play the first game, as the characters and plot are strongly tied to the original. The gameplay is generally the same, so there are very few issues with going back and starting from the beginning. Last Light is much longer; 2033 took me maybe 12 hours to finish while Last Light bumped it up to a nice 25 hours with the DLC. It was surprising how similar the games were in terms of gameplay; playing both games back to back felt like one experience. I strongly suggest starting with the first game though, the story and characters are extremely tied to the events of the first game.

[h1]Complaints[/h1]
I think Last Light is phenomenal, and it is really hard to come up with any issues that would turn me away from the game.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]
Last Light is one of those titles that ultimately requires you to want to play it multiple times rather than offering you an incentive. The main story and DLC are generally one-and-done, but the Ranger Hardcore mode offers very unique and immersive gameplay compared to the base difficulties and could easily be considered it's own experience. Skipping the difficulty options, there is no new game+ or unlockables for future playthroughs. There is one alternative ending, but its pretty uncommon to naturally come across the majority of moral points you need to see it. 

[h1]Extra Content[/h1]
The DLC in Last Light is featured as extra missions you can play at any time. They are generally different viewpoints from other characters during the story and some insight into older events. They are very straight forward, but each are worth a playthrough. None of the DLC enhance the main story in any way. 

[h1]Achievements[/h1]
You are required to do two full playthroughs for each ending, with the ""pacifist"" ending requiring you to gather many moral points. The moral points come from very specific events and not having enough can void the ending, even if you did not kill a soul. I recommend a guide for that specific path. No grinding needed, just be aware of what you should be looking for and you will get the vast majority of achievements without any issues.

[h1]Technical Issues[/h1]
My pre-rendered cutscenes had a very low resolution and framerate. There are very few cutscenes in the game, so this was barely an issue, but it does look awful. I wanted to have better immersion and use Russian for my language setting, but it did not pick up side dialog correctly and made following discussions a bad experience. The only instability I had in game was a very specific DLC mission, although it never came back and I could not repeat the crash. The game is very stable otherwise. A feature of the Metro series is to use the currency (pre-war ammo) as actual ammunition. Sometimes my weapon would automatically default to this after swapping weapons. It was rare, but if I wasn't such a hoarder I would have gone broke. I found no work around for this, so be careful on higher difficulties that remove your HUD. 

[h1]Value[/h1]
At this time you can no longer purchase the regular edition, but Last Light Redux is very much worth it the current full price. It comes will all the DLC included from the original release and offers about 25 hours of gameplay for a regular run. The game frequently drops to $5 and is a complete steal at this price. I do recommend the bundle that has the other two games (2033 and Exodus) over buying Last Light individually, though.",1655897468,1656141471,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

STORY
Since the first game is the introduction to the metro environment it's hard to keep the same tension with the atmosphere alone so Last Light dive more into the political parties and conflicts of the metro while also keeping the mystical side of things with the dark ones and the likes around. The story is more complex and goes into further details about subjects that 2033 didn't really expand upon like the motivations of the different factions and the dark ones making the world much more rich. While there are a few familiar faces like Khan a bunch of new ones are introduced that are honestly pretty interesting like Pavlov which without spoiling gave me an internal conflict after a certain point in the game. There are 2 endings and the same moral system that requires Artyom to listen to conversations and make decisions in order to gain insight on the world. It isn't always obvious but using the general rule to listen to every conversation to the end and trying to be morally good does enough of a job to unlock the good ending which is also cannon this time around.

GAMEPLAY
Most of it remains like 2033 but there are what I consider quality of life improvements added to the game that I liked. You can sneak up to an enemy and get a prompt on whether to knock unconscious (which wasn't a thing before) or kill so it's a more reliable system in general. It's possible to customise any guns at a merchant to add attachments for a price so no more looking around for guns that have everything you wanted on it. The rest is more or less the same, the gun selection is slightly expanded and the gunplay plays closely like 2033 which was decent. Stealth is still good, the hidden indicator is only on/off instead of 3 light colours but it works the same at the end of the day which is keep to the dark and they won't see you unless you step on glass or something noisy. It's worth nothing that performance is good and I didn't get game-breaking bugs or crashes but only the occasional ""jank"" which isn't a new thing for anyone who played the first game anyways.

WORLD
A good part of Last Light is how they made levels longer, more detailed and more varied. While some levels don't have the possibility to use stealth I'd say most of them do and they are generally the ones I enjoyed the most to listen to conversations and interact with the environment. The only downside to favouring stealth is the lack of manual save, checkpoints works but it ends up forcing the player to redo sections needlessly many times. The option to go guns blazing is still available for the action oriented player but I'm still of the opinion that you will miss a fair bit of information and I'm fairly confident that it's not possible to get the good ending this way. My only criticism is that there is a bit too much ammunition laying around in most levels that you end up not even needing to be conservative but that could be to account for the aforementioned guns blazing playstyle so it's not a big deal. 

CONCLUSION
Really fun game with a good story that greatly expand upon what 2033 did, slightly improved gameplay and bigger and better level design. For anyone who enjoyed the first Metro this is going to be right up your alley. This version isn't available for purchase and Redux which has Survival mode which balances loot like 2033 basically addressing my criticism is a good pick. The differences are minor enough to not have to worry about them and it's not like there is much of a choice anyways.",1654622984,1654622984,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I played this briefly when I still used Windows and it's quite possible that playing the game via Proton may give a better result than using the Linux port as I don't remember any particular issues when I played it then. Suffice it to say that the Linux version crashes with dismal regularity and it appears the further you get into the game the more often it happens as I got through the early chapters without any issues.

The game design is a matter of taste, personally I don't like checkpoints and I particularly don't like checkpoints that are made seconds before you're going to get insta-killed. There are also bugs that hinder you completing some sections. I've yet to get past one section, where you have to kill a giant shrimp with the help of some NPC's, because although the shrimp appeared it promptly vanished making it invulnerable, leaving my character to die of asphyxiation when I ran out of gas mask filters - another element of the game design custom made to drain the enjoyment out of playing it.

Update: Finally finished this game. The design flaws - spending time hunting for filters, tedious arena battles where you just run around being chased by some monstrous creature - are all present and correct in the rest of the game past the shrimp battle but they're bearable. On the plus side the 'crashing every few minutes' problem seemed to mostly disappear past this point. Possibly glitches in these particular level designs made this problem worse. It still crashes to desktop but more like once or twice a session rather than continually so I was able to get through most chapters without being interrupted.

On the design I was aware before starting the game  that there are two possible endings. The 'good' one depends on you performing a myriad of different actions as you progress through and not doing other things - killing a particular bad guy and so on. There's virtually no clue about any of this in the game itself and you'll likely only see the good ending if you carefully read walkthroughs and replay chapters until you've got it perfect.",1627243246,1636452309,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a lot of fun playing the game and only had a few crashes, but it didn't lessen my enjoyment. The atmosphere and world are truly awesome and definitely an improvement over the first game.

The downsides are the criteria for the different endings feels like something you would need a guide to actually accomplish, but that only dragged the experience down a small bit and some of the boss fight moments feel kind of out of place.

43160,90915731,76561197969880352,0,168,2612,0,2612,1577829305,"I loved the first Metro game. I played it after finishing the STALKER series, and the similarities were apparent, but the games were different enough to make both worth playing: STALKER is an RPG that happens to be played like an FPS, whereas Metro: 2033 is an FPS with RPG elements. STALKER was mostly played on the surface, while Metro was, well, in the Metro. It was fun, it looked good, played well, and I enjoyed a lot of the moral ambiguity they brought to the story through player agency.

I had huge hopes for this sequel, but sadly, Metro: Last Light never takes off, and while struggling to take flight it's mired in a swamp of myriad issues.

Like its predecessor, you can use ammo to purchase and upgrade weapons in towns where you can talk to NPCs, and occasionally even do the odd side quest for them. The quarters are cramped, and the atmosphere is tense.

Unlike the original, it feels like nothing matters here. The weapon upgrades don't matter because there's not nearly enough ammo for many of the missions - you have to be hitting weakspots and rely on sprinting past groups or infinite spawns or you will run out of bullets. Worse, stealth has effectively been removed as an option because you're fighting a much higher percentage of monsters vs humans, and they can't be snuck up upon and stealthily dispatched. And the humans you do fight are often in scripted sequences, so they're going to spot you even if you're meticulously slow and careful.

Your choices certainly don't matter, at least not up until the very end. It's a disappointing simplification of what felt like constant ethical questioning in 2033.

This is all made worse by the graphics. Visually they're fine - about on par with the previous game, which makes sense given it's using the same in-house engine - but performance wise there are some absolutely terrible spots that make the game literally unplayable. Any time I encountered a large amount of fire the particle effects pegged my CPU at 100% and the framerate dropped to about one frame every ten seconds. This happened whether there were enemies on screen or not. And one of the times it happened there was an extended fight with monsters coming out the woodwork from all directions. Determined not to be defeated by poorly written code, I cranked down all the settings I could on a machine that shouldn't have had any problems running the game at max and managed to get through those sections with about 1-2 frames per second. It was tedious, frustrating, and something I shouldn't have had to deal with. If you search the Steam discussions or other forums you'll see that I'm far from the only person with this issue. I'm sure many people gave up rather than continuing, as I almost did. It's an unacceptable situation to put players into, and you should not reward this game with a purchase because they still haven't patched it.

Finally, the story is a huge let down compared to 2033. It's in the way the story is told as well: the first Metro put a lot of effort into making the player feel like they were a part of this imaginary world, and that care and detail are missing in this sequel. You are now a spectator.

The game feels very linear and one wonders several times if you are actually ""playing"" a game or are just playing a lot of cut scenes? The game also has some annoyances where you just walk around the ""wrong corner"" and cannot go back a check the previous rooms! 

Definitely the best thing about the whole game is the exploration of the apocalyptic city, Moscow, where you wander around the dark tunnels and streets with just one rifle, one flashlight, your ABC mask and all the time and eye on your watch that tells and when to run dry of air.

Metro Last Light is an FPS in the (very close) tradition of Half-Life 2. You play Artyom in Moscow after a nuclear war. The public government is broken, nonexistent and anarchy prevails. People fleed into the Metro (hence the name) to survive and escape the radioactive fallout. Mutants roam the streets and in the tunnels, adding up to the danger. Your character is a Ranger of The Order and finds himself in between the different factions like The Red (communists), Reich (Nazis), Bandits, ... Though the game is very linear, the storyline is quite intriguing and in the course of actions you find friendship, are betrayed and discover a plot of mass destruction which - of course - you have to prevent.

And it is this story alongside the graphics the game shines. These two things are the strong points of Metro Last Light. Ok, the story abates to the end.

Next is your weapon arsenal: you have a good choice of the usual FPS weapons. There's also some limited weapon crafting in the game. 

... but then there is the gameplay itself. Looking closely, Metro Last Light is no match for Half-Life 2. Yes, the graphics are better and Metro has some nice immersive stuff, like wiping your mask. Yet, the game is thrifty when it comes to actual numbers and player orientation, guidance. You do not know your health stat in numbers or the quality of your guns. You have to judge the effectiveness of a weapon by the looks of it or how it feels to handle it. You also have no map of any area.

The game is very dim light in many, many places and interactive objects do not light up. Well, at least too weak for me to be noticed. I'm sure, I missed a ton on my playthrough. On the other hand, the game shows a lock symbol in your face when you cannot interact with a locker. But not on the thousand other objects, why?

On some maps, I got lost very easily. It's not that the maps are big, but sometimes just confusing, e.g. in the Swamp I circled for ages until I found finally the gas. More often then not, I did not know where to go and stumbled to the next level rather by accident than by plan.

And finally, the save game mechanics: you have one single save and it's checkpoint based. WTF?! This is just plain righteous stupid. When you got the next level, this is it. You can't go back and try different things, different paths. For me, as a completionist, this is unacceptable. More than once I just stumbled to the next level by opening a door (e.g. Venice) and all my plans in doing different, new things in the level just before vaporized. That nagged on me more than once.

... or the hidden in-game moral level deciding which of the endings you will be offered. You do not get any feedback for some ""good"" and ""right"" actions, though I read online, that you get bad points for killing a lot while you get good points for various good deeds. Among these is ... wait for it .. squeezing a teddy bear(?!). There's no feedback on this right within the game for the player. So this is hard to verify.

Another, somehow irritating element: the game has a lot of spoken parts. Now, the voicing is in English with a heavy Russian dialect. This supports the idea, that the game takes place in the Moscow Metro. Without this, only the occasional signs in Cyrillic would give you this idea, since the game world could be likely anywhere else: Paris, New York. However, the people also talk with Russian English among themselves and the longer you think about this, the more awkward this appears. I mean, this dialect is very hard to blend out. It is omnipresent when you listening to the game. And as such it always stresses the fact, that the speaker is not speaking his mother tongue. As a result, it feels like no-one in the game speaks his mother tongue but turns to some clumsy Russian English when they speak among themselves, especially when you are around. Once I got this idea, it festered and then it's just been super wired walking around people and listening to them. As if I have a big cap phrasing ""Foreigner: at least try to speak English"" on my head. That became quite silly in the end.

And, yes: it crashed about every half hour.

Summary: Metro Last Light has excellent storytelling, high-quality graphics, and some little nice immersive but fails badly on the details on game mechanics and overall gameplay. For me, the dumb choice on game saves has cost the game 2 points. An additional big minus for the obvious deliberate withhold of game information and playing stats for the player. The rest are minor quirks.

[h1]Action, Stealth[/h1]

Back when Metro 2033 came out was hesitant on getting it since I heard good things about it, but did not see much in the way of hype. I decided to buy it anyway and was not disappointed, it became one of my most favorite games that I ever played. Then comes Last Light. Last Light improves on almost everything that 2033 had issues with, from the gameplay to the AI.

Last Light starts off a year after 2033 and expands on the story of 2033. You are Artyom and you have a mission to find the last remaining ""Dark One"" a race of creatures that were believed to be evil on the first game. I am not going to go any further into the story than so people can play the first game and be surprised of the out come.

The story of Last Light is well told, which is a very good thing since Last Light is a story driven FPS. You a should play 2033 first before trying this game to understand fully what is going on. The story starts out slow, but picks up in its emotion and intensity through out. It will have you craving for more. Voice acting is sufficant, it is not bad yet not great, but even with the voice acting being the way it is you still care for certain characters and loath others. If you are looking for an FPS with story focus Last Light could be a good choice.

Gameplay is another aspect of the game that has been enhanced. AI on the first game was hit or miss. Sometimes the enemies would be as dumb as rocks and other times they could spot you through a wall. This time around though the AI is actually smart. Taking guys out silently will not have them running at you, they actually try to search for the source of the noise. If you are in a dark enough area crouched, they will not see you. The handling of the guns feels so much smoother, it is up there with the AAA shooters that are dominating the market.

Stealth is a big part of Last Light, the enhanced gameplay helps with this aspect as well. When going into a room with a bunch of men. You can sneak around and unscrew the light bulbs so it will be harder for enemies to find you. And if you are lucky enough there might be a fuse box to turn off making it completely dark and might even lure an enemy over for an easy kill, that is out of the way. You can even make it through the game with out even killing a single human.

Even when combat becomes hectic the fluid gunplay holds up and makes for a great and challenging time. Humans are not the only enemies on the game, there are monsters as well, who are mostly fought upclose and personal with no stealth. Although there are parts where you can sneek past the creatures to conserve ammo, which brings me up to another aspect of the game, the ammo. Instead of running and gunning you should take your time and plan your tactics out, ammo is a scarcity. Every bullet you pick up bring ease to the fights. Another way ammo is used is for money, yes money. There is a special military grade bullet that is used as currency. This ammo is even more rare and is also a lot more powerful, taking enemies down much quicker, but I recommend not doing that to often, since the ammo is good to buy other items such as filters.

When going up to the surface from the Metro you have to put on a gas mask that is limited of oxygen. To continue being able to breath you need to find filters, which are rare as well and are a relief when found.

For anyone who has played 2033 you will know that graphics and detail are big part of Metro as well. LL does not disappoint, it is one of the best looking games of this years especially on PC. The detail in the world is beautiful, in a depressing way. The would is full of life (and death) from stations with many people to interact with the game just looks great. Not a single corner is left unthought of.

So in all if you are looking forward to an FPS that is different than other shooters that is story driven, then this game is for you.",1368983567,1575129652,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

This post-nuclear holocaust FPS / Adventure game is set in the Moscow Metro railway tunnels. The graphics are gritty, rugged and portray a jury rigged world of technological left-overs with truly amazing fidelity. For example. as you move in to scavenge from dead bodies, you hear the buzz of flies and many of the bodies are done as rags and yellowed bone, which is more accurate and not as in-your-face as the chunks of flesh that seem to be all the rage in most games. 
The game rewards (and almost requires) stealth to be used as you navigate crowded, claustrophic areas full of hostiles. You can take advantage of shadows, lower the noise of your movement and choose between guns, silenced guns (and yes, they still make noise, and yes the other guards will hear them) or go to knives for close in and silent. If you find a good spot to observe from, you can work out their patrol patterns and take them down at opportune moments. When the inevitable gunfight breaks out, features such as iron sights make it great fun. 

The radiation induced monsters (*probably* radiation-induced) are difficult to pick out and get the blood pumping. There are nasties that are all but immune to bullets. A light will actually hurt them, so you cower behind your flashlight. I challenge anyone NOT to waste ammo shooting when these things charge! Oh, and how long is it since you hand-cranked the charger for your light? it went out? Oh dear...

On the surface you must always wear a gas mask, but each filter only lasts five minutes. This is adroitly displayed on a wristwatch you wear and reset every time you change a filter. The watch also has a light that comes on whenever you are visible (stealth meter). If things are too busy to watch the clock, you can hear your breath getting more laboured as the end of life for the filter approaches.

SO its things like the attention to detail with audio cues and the putting timers on a wrist-watch rather than a hi-tech HUD that make this game. It even has a ""Ranger mode"" where the rest of the HUD is removed and you play with no cues other than what you see & hear. Oh, and did I mention the graphics are stunning? Did I use the word ""gritty"" enough?

If you want a game that will suck you into an immersive world, get this, load it, turn off the lights and play! I love it

Are there bad points? Yeah, but I consider them minor. THe story line is  linear.The hand-cranked charger for your helmet light is also a universal power-up to turn on lights and powered doors with only 2-3 squeezes. The guards react to team-mates in trouble but could be a bit sharper about it. So far, thats it. I will come back and review\update this  in a week's time and see if my views have changed

the wonderful morality system rewards you for eavesdropping on worried families and guards wholl gladly ventilate you talking about their next moves and doing jack shit about it or and penalizes you harshly for killing people that tried to murder you but only if youve heard their names previously

while infiltrating in nazi home turf feel free to be considered a good man for watching nazis lynch each other and then become an irredeemable husk of a man when you shoot a man holding a fellow ranger hostage at knifepoint or holding your fire and applying your own knife to his throat with substantially more success later on

if you feel like going 135 down the fast lane to ukrainian hell you can also pay for a lap dance and shoot mutants thatll eat you if you get within the same county as you after hasturs baby pinkie promises they wont eat you if youre two counties away

artyom shoots people and fails to afraid of anything in the russian underground and halfway asphixiates on the surface because there arent tunnels connecting all of russia and i guess every factions more than willing to take horrifying casualties just walking to an enemys home turf

his fabled order of the rangers finds a neat nidden bunker and decides that literally everybody else can suck a fat cock but then again literally everybody else is commies or nazis or kind of dead anyways so i guess they can party there all they want without losing the moral high ground in this metaphorical plateau

really though its not like theyre hogging a whole lot of food in that bunker unless the irradiated ubermensch of the future can eat smallpox so any and all conflict over the shitpile of a bunker might as well be for bragging rights

commies and nazis and dead guys dont really get the picture though so the nazis build concentration camps for people with big heads because it worked well for pol pot and the commies steal some of the bioweapons to kill off good chunks of the metro since even theyre well aware that communism works best with up to four people 

after atryoms capture by nazis on a routine leisurely stroll through irradiated russia hes saved by a man named pavel morozov and if your knowledge of russian history surpasses that of your american history class you get a good hint of precisely what happens to this commie-ranger union

your escape from the nazis leads to your capture by commies which leads to your escape from the commies and a meeting with nyarlathoteps naive grandkid who disguises himself as a regular kid following a stern heavily armed juggernaut straight out of d6 

thankfully any and all forms of child protective services are solely manned by stern russian non-juggernauts thatve only seen the letters d6 on their last game of weird slavic bingo

you plow through any and all resistance including a mutant hippo and a really pissed off shrimp on a mission to return to d6 and someone who bet theres no way youd do this shit to get ets bastard child owes you a hundred bullets that arent loaded with charcoal and piss 

oh and the commies mount an offensive with dudes that are armored but not as much as you and tanks with mystic immortality runes scrawled upon their tires in invisible ink 

their secret weapons you ask

Some glitches like the saving points made the game sometimes unplayable. Therefore, I was a bit sceptic about Metro Last Light. Finally, I bought it for 30 EUR and I am not regretting it. The graphics are state of the art, the atmosphere and story better than in most games. With 11 hours for the first playthrough it is not shorter than most of the other big titles. The fights with the other soldiers are a lot of fun and motivating (the fights with the monster are rather dumb), as you can just run into the fight or try to stealth. So, no fight is going to be the same. As I play almost all my games with 3D vision and I am incredible happy about the perfect adaptation MLL delivers. No further fixes are needed. The developpers not only adapted their game for casual gamers as well as technic lovers. Maybe the game is a bit to linear, but what I actually don't see as a negativ point for myself. I know, some will. Further, it crushed some times. Overall a great game experience I highly reccommend to everyone who likes atmospheric shooters. I defintely going to play it a second time and will also restart with Metro 2033. Rating: 8/10.

And now that I have beaten the game, I can say that it was well worth the wait.

Most of the problem that I had with the first game, have been improved in Last light. First of all, the good stuff.Let's start with the gameplay. Shooting feel just as good as it did in the first game, and the guns may have even had a bit more punch in them this time around. Guns really feel and sound powerful, which I love. Shooting enemies to the non armored parts does more damage, all this good stuff. The stealth in this game has been improved by a lot. The stealth elements in the first game were ok at best, but this time around, the stealth mechanics are suprisingly good. Enemies react to bodies and sound, turning off lights makes you harder to spot, and alarms don't activate as soon as you get spotted. The atmosphere is just as great as it was before. Sneaking around the dark tunnels can get real creepy at times, and the ""cities"" that you get to visit, really feel alive. It's all great stuff.

But what about the story? I did find the story of Last light to be more interesting than the story in the first game. They added some good new characters into the mix, and also some of the old characters make a comeback in this game. They also let you make these little choises from time to time, and those choises can lead to an alternate ending.

Visually the game looks amazing at times. If you have the horsepower to run it on higher settings, it is without a doubt 1 of the best looking pc games out there. The enviroments also felt more varied this time around, so you will have plenty of fantastic looking places to visit.

But, with the good comes the bad. The voice acting is still quite weak, so that has not changed a bit. I also don't understand why the main character only talks during loading screens, but never when you are actually controlling him. It seems like a pretty weird thing to me. Another problem that I also had in Metro 2033 was the fact that the game is a bit too linear. The enviroments seems perfect for more exploring, but most of the time the path ahead is quite linear. They do let you wander about quite freely from time to time, but still, I would have liked to see a bit more of that. I did also encounter some pretty annoying glicthes here and there. Didn't see a lot of those in the first game.
 Now 1 more thing, but is it just me, or was this game far easier than Metro 2033. You seem to die WAY slower in this game. I didn't mind the challenge in Metro 2033(besides those few insane difficulty spikes), so I am a little disappointed about this change. Maybe my MLG skillez were simply too much for this game.

In the end, I think that this game does take quite a few steps to a better direction. Metro last light is not far away from being something amazing, but because of the issues that it still has, I can't quite call it that.If there is going to be a third game, maybe that 1 will go all the way. So overall, it's 1 of the best shooters of the year, and totally worth checking out.",1388778032,1483451973,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It's also a very worthy sequel to its predecessor Metro 2033 and improves on the first game on pretty much every level. Besides the excellent narrative and stunning visuals the highlight of the game is without a doubt the brilliant atmosphere. The locations you visit are presented in incredible detail and you'll really feel the world around you is alive, especially when you visit some more populated areas.

With a graphically intense game such as this it's also very important that it runs well. Luckily the game performs a lot better than Metro 2033. There's plenty of video options to tweak and even with an older system the game runs pretty well and still looks good.

The game is very story driven and so you should expect a game that takes its time to explain things to you. If you want fast gameplay where you shoot dozens of enemies in the face continuously then this game might not be for you. It's pace can be slow at times and although it does allow you the freedom to approach each situation as you desire, stealth is often a much better solution then to go in guns blazing.",1395607015,1459618399,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

---REVIEW---

The graphics in this game, is some of the best I have ever seen, it is up
at the level with Crysis 3. Words can't really justify the level of the
graphical technology this game holds, textures, effects, models,
animations, it's a masterpiece. The graphics simply are stunning.
The attention to details, tiny details most other games don't care about,
they went a step further on the tiny details and effects, and all the small
things that you would not thing could make a much difference in the
graphical experience, when they are brought together, gives you a visual
eye candy you've rarly seen in a game before.

The world of Metro: Last Light, is, as well as the graphics, stunning.
The different underground towns of the metro, the creativity that
went into designing and building these small and large towns are
just amazing. The world seems realistic, it's how I would have imagined
the post-apocalyptic underground world would look like after the apocalypse.
It's hard to walk through these towns without stopping to look at the design of it.

And then it's the surface. It is breathtaking. The remaining ruins of
skyscrapers and buildings covers the background, the dynamic weather
and day time, the storms you'll encounter on the surface, fallen buildings,
it's hard to not want to spend your time, just exploring everything you can.

Here is where all the small details comes into play, giving you a realistic
feel to the game. The underground towns are filled with people, speaking,
doing their stuff, it feels alive. The tunnels are filled with small critters
and bigger monsters, the surface has it's own ecosystem, you'll see
other monsters attack smaller ones. Plant life moving the the wind,
sparkles bounching off the wall and other objects, things breaking
in a bullet fire with enemies, light sources can be turned off and broken
to darken the place, you'll need a gasmask when going on the surface, rain,
water, mud and blood will spill on the glass of your gasmask.
The world seems so much alive, and it really brings you into the game.

The only downside is the game's performance.

It do require a really powerfull PC, and even with a high-end PC, you'll
still encounter places with FPS lag. This is the only negative side.

I've said alot about the stunning graphics, design and the world of the Metro.
But how good is it as a shooting game?

Stunning here aswell. The weapons really feels real, when you fire your
weapon at a enemy, it really feels like it packs a punch, that it will
oblitorate the target. It's a real joy to end up in fire fights in this game,
it hits a level of FPS gameplay few games has. It's one of the most
refined, thrilling and enjoyable FPS gameplays I've had in a long time.

But, if you're not much into engorging in a stunning bloody fire fight,
this game also has a really good stealth mechanics. You can do most
of the sections in this game without even pulling the trigger, and it's,
not boring. Even the stealth part is a joy to do.

The story, is enough to keep you going. It's not bad, not at all,
but it's not great either. The story is just interesting enough to
keep you interested, but there's no huge plot twist in it, it's
pretty predictable, and sometimes it feels like a confusing cluster fuck.
The game DO offer you some moral choises,
which will have a impact for the ending.

---CONCLUTION---

This game has an ok story, but, the graphics and the FPS gameplay
is some of the best there is. It really has done a superb job here,
and it has entered my list as one of my fave games of all time.

First of all, I do not recomend this game. Why? A number of reasons. First and above all of them: 2033 is better, spend your money and your time with that game.

Sure, graphics are good, but everything is more colorful, thus making the game look a little bit happier, less threatening and sad. You get better textures at everything, better lightning, but the tradeoff is that you feel like walking through a park, instead of a dead world, like in 2033.

One of the worst things by far is the stealth system. It's so retarded and easy that you can speedrun through the game in Ranger Hardcore without even breaking a sweat. You can stand right in front of enemies and dance, as long as you're in the shadows, you're good. In 2033, you gotta know the map, you gotta pay attention to enemies and their patrol routines, you gotta be quiet and patient. In Last Light, you just have to remain in the shadows, and sometimes not even that. You can literally run in front of an enemy and, if you take him out fast enough, he can't even call for aid. If you like that kind of unrealistic ""stealth"" gameplay, you might like the game. Otherwise, you have been warned.

About ammo and filters: You won't have to worry about them, not even in Ranger Hardcore. You'll get so many shit all the time, you can literally sell spare ammo and supplies between stations, without worrying about not having enough ammo for fights.

Well, all in all, the only thing improved in Last Light compared to 2033 must probably be the increased number of weapons and its upgrade system. If you, like me, have played 2033 too many times and want something new, Last Light might be worth looking into. If this is your first time in the series and you want to buy both 2033 and Last Light, scratch buying Last Light and stick with 2033, you'll love that game.

And don't even consider buying the Redux version of either games. Holy shit, those are some of the worst remakes in history.

Unlike other 'run & gun' FPSs, Metro challenges you to use stealth and stalking in an enjoyable way, with nothing too forced, making it feel more like an RPG or an intense horror game as you're slowly and carefully planning out your next room of people to kill.  And then when you get bored being sneaky and stabbing necks...you can just riddle everyone in the room with bullets! (or die trying.)

Very much like Bioshock Infinite I'd describe this game as an experience but for all the opposite reasons. Where Bioshock Infinite does the best job with world building and story I've possibly yet come to enjoy my entire life, it's mechanics are far too weak and far too frequently relied upon to the point that it ends up horribly hurting the game's progression. Sometimes there is so little story development for such long periods of time that combat became bland and as stale as Call of Duty's. 

In Last Light almost all focus is on the quality of your moving through the world's exotic environments and the occasional supernatural element seeping through along the way. Of course this weakens the main story which is hardly worth note but isn't terrible either. Even though almost every plot point feels like a means by which to get you to another part of Moscow, that place you're brought to is often quite different from the last and consistently no less interesting. Enjoy every last moment out in the wild because that is where this game is at its best, in the tunnels below and the wasteland above where man dares not stay for long.

If you're looking for game that is the very embodiment of extremely well refined and immersive gameplay mechanics, then this is a must buy.

↓Original Review↓

An absolutely beautiful example of what a PC game can look like. The textures and all those basics are good, however the lighting is just beautiful and the environmental effects add a great deal to the world. This may easily well be the best looking game I have ever played.

You have to manually charge the battery that powers your light every now & then, replace the filter on your mask, along with a whole bunch of other little things that make the game just that much more immersive. But none of these little things ever feel like they're in the way, if anything they add an element of immersion I wish other developers would bother to put in their games.

The guns feel great and more enjoyable than any other game in recent memory. Each has about 3-4 customization options from stocks and scopes to different barrel tips among other weapon specific components.

The human AI can be a bit janky at times but mutants are intelligent and you'll spend plenty of time fighting them. Also I come across maybe 2-3 bugs through the whole game, one of them forced a checkpoint restart. Though checkpoints are hardly more than 10 minutes apart so it's not an issue at all, as there are barely any bugs in the first place.

The world is very linear but often allows for some exploration after about two to three hours into the game. If they were to make a Fallout-esq open world game in this world that wasn't so story driven it could easily be game of the decade worthy.

The story is alright, the world is interesting, and occasionally you'll encounter the game's horror element which does indeed go beyond creepy mutants crawling about. Though in the end, I have pretty much no issue with the game at all aside from it holding your hand too long at the start.

All in all, its certainly worth the $45 I paid and I encourage you to play ranger mode even if you're new.",1368645370,1420244929,True,2,0,0.486289739608764648,0,True,False,False

To start off, this game is just beautiful, offering some of the best visuals I have seen in a game thus far. Just make sure you have SSAA turned off, or it will most likely kill your framerate, even for a high end system(it has its own AA built in anyway). The game has one of the most immersive and unique experiences you will find, and is probably my favorite post-apocalyptic set game that I've played. Unique game mechanics like using your lighter to burn cobwebs, manually charging up your flashlight, wiping dirt and grime off your gas mask, and replacing air filters really add to the experience and immerse you in it, and its things like this that really set Metro apart from other games and make it something special. The gameplay itself follows the formula mostly of a stealth shooter, and there is a great arsenal of guns with a good amount of customization to each.

One drawback of the game is that it is very linear most of the way, and it doesn't have as many opportunites to explore as some might like. However, that doesn't take away from the game, as there is a huge variety of level design, each area will feel unique and different. The areas with civilians are particularly interesting, because you can listen in on conversations people are having regarding things going on in the metro or in their personal lives. Listening to the stories of the Metro will make you become emotionally invested in the game and make you empathize with worlds characters, which is a great addition to the game experience.

[h1]INTRODUCTION[/h1]

If you're looking for a good story-driven and atmospheric title, look no further than Metro Last Light. This game is a combination of both good storytelling and mechanics. It incorporates both stealth and run-and-gun playstyles into the game, allowing the player to truly choose what kind of gameplay they are looking for. As we all know that Metro 2033's AI... Wasn't particularly fantastic for the most part..

     Last Light directly picks off where the story ended in Metro 2033, and of course you're still playing as Artyom. Several new characters were also added into the series. Set in a post-apocalyptic Russian environment, there are a total of 3 factions. The first one are The Rangers (well, supposedly the ""good guys"", which explains why Artyom is one of them), the Red Line (damn commies), and the Fourth Reich (damn Nazis). All fighting to survive in the harsh world of Metro. 

WARNING: I don't recommend this game to people who have arachnophobia or claustrophobia. Not at all.

[h1]LIKES[/h1]

Good things, and things i liked about Metro Last Light
[list]
    [*] The AI in this game is improved from Metro 2033, where enemies don't have aimbot-like aim, and know exactly where you are no matter how dark of an environment you're in. It's fun to stealth around during a couple of mission, or go straight-out rambo when you're bored.

    [*] The setting of the game is atmospheric, realistic, and believable. All the ruins of buildings, crashed planes and worn-down church are the result of the aftermath. The exterior and interior of these structures are well-detailed.

    [*] The graphical fidelity of the game is not a let-down.[/b] In/outdoors of the game's environment looks phenomenally beautiful and of high quality. Really shows off the game engine pretty impressively if you would ask me.

     [*] Story of the game is compelling, not a lackluster mainstream FPS, Battlefield single player style crap. If you enjoy playing games with a good storyline, the Metro Series definitely provides that for you. Only a few games are able to touch on the genre of humanity, and do it well at the same time. (e.g. Fallout, The Last of Us, Half-Life franchise, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, etc)

    [*][spoiler]Stripshows and boobies?!:OOOO[/spoiler]

     [*] The monsters are designed to a horrifying degree. And they scared the *** out of me, A LOT. Especially when a group of Nosalies ambush me out of nowhere. I also learnt that spiders can be scary too. 

     [*] Amazing soundtracks, appropriate during fights, dialogues and levels.[/b] A simple Youtube search for 'Metro Last Light OST' will give you results of fantastic soundtracks of the game to listen to.

     [*] Ammunition is scarce (at higher difficulty levels), weapons hit hard & are satisfying. [/b] Although you're able to loot from corpses, the game doesn't give you much ammo if you're playing on for example, the Ranger Mode. The AK and my personal favorite, the Abzats (Rambo Shotgun style), hit as hard as a train.

     [*] Weapon customization is simplistic and rewarding. [/b] The price for attachments like silencers and optics varies, but they are very cool to use and play around with.
[/list]


[h1]DISLIKES[/h1]

Well, here are some things that i find, are unfortunately not as attracting as the ones mentioned above.
[list]
     [*] The game is really linear and sometimes dull. The story progresses through sneaking around and shooting people (while they're not aware) most of the time. Every single section of the game involves shooting people, or mutants.

     [*] What?! Ranger Mode (which is the way the game was meant to be played) is only able to be acquired through a paid DLC? This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. 

     [*] DLC contents are also really disappointing, especially when they cost so much for so little. Only the Chronicles Pack is worth your time and money in my own personal opinion if you are interested in getting any DLC content for this game. I've tried and finished every single DLC mission and almost none are particularly interesting/fun.
     
     [*] Artyom is a mute protagonist almost all the time.. You'll only hear him talking between cutscnenes, or when he's choking and gasping for air. Other than that, he's pretty much mute when people are talking to him.
[/list]

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
Overall, this game is well-worth your money and your time. Do yourself a favor and get this game if you haven't already. Length of the game is around 15-30 hours. 

I don't think there's any valid reason not to pick this game up, unless you really, really hate having fun or you're generally a sadist.

As far as on rail shooters go, this is one of the best, the atmosphere and tention are well placed and serve the story well. You mostly fight mutants with the occasional humans. I'd rather not say more, and let you experience the story, it is one of those FPS you actually play for the engaging story rather than multiplayer.

Set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow which was destroyed by nuclear war. A small handful of the population managed to seek shelter in the subway tunnels beneath the city. Twenty years have passed, the world has become inhabited with mutants and the surviving population has broken up into various factions.
 
Featuring a strong narrative and great pacing, Metro will keep you immersed the entire time. The story is told through eyes of a ranger named Artyom and not through irritating and pacing-breaking cutscenes like a lot of other games. Journal entries can also be found and Artyom serves as a narrator who often talks about the events unfolding around him.
 
It’s the direct sequel to Metro 2033 but playing the first title isn’t required to enjoying the game.
 
Metro Last Light tries to do a bit of everything, it’s primarily a first person shooter but it incorporates stealth elements very well. It also feels like a survival horror at points and can be quite tense when you venture out onto the irradiated surface with a gas mask. The audio is great and the screams of mutants in the distance will always keep you on the edge of your seat. There is a fairly large variety of enemies which are all hideous, unique and well done.
 
The atmosphere is amazing, same with the graphics. It’s worth noting that a somewhat powerful computer is required to running Metro Last Light. I was able to run the game at 1920 x 1080 on Very High at around 70FPS average with an Intel i5 3470K Processor, 16gbs of RAM, and an Nvidia GTX 560TI. I have heard that the game does have some issues with certain ATI cards though which can be fixed by turning off Physx in the settings.
 
Metro Last Light also has multiple endings and plenty of re-playability. It may appear linear early on but it quickly branches out later allowing plenty of room for exploration.

*Please note that I have not played Last Light Redux.  This review reflects my thoughts on the complete edition of the original Metro: Last Light.*

(Story)

Set sometime after Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light sees the protagonist of the first game, Artyom, setting out on one last mission.  Rumors of a Dark One near the station, in conjunction with the persistence of Artyom's bad dreams, convince Artyom and his friend Khan to hunt down this last threat.  It is soon revealed however that Artyom harbors a secret regarding the Dark Ones, a secret that will alter the player's perspective on the Metro universe and help uncover a horrible conspiracy.

The Complete Edition includes all of the DLC missions too.  These missions are played from the perspective of supporting characters from the main game, such as Khan, or random soldiers from the various factions.  The DLC missions give the player some backstory on the supporting characters and what they experience in the main plot of Metro: Last Light.   

(Design)

Metro: Last Light is a linear first person shooter with stealth elements and minor exploration.  The stealth gameplay has been vastly improved from Metro 2033 thanks to better AI, better lighting/concealment mechanics, and tweeked mechanics in general. For example, you can now execute a lethal or non-lethal takedown on unsuspecting enemies and throwing knives can be thrown at the push of a button, rather than equipping them as in 2033.  There is only one ammo type now for each weapon and it is plentiful enough that the guns blazing approach works.  What this means is that Last Light loses the survival horror aspect of 2033, trading it for a better overrall gameplay experience.  Levels have some exploration, but it's no longer necessary to do so since supplies can be found all over the beaten path.  There is incentive to explore, such as optional missions, hidden gear, or an eerie supernatural sequence.  Also, the fear of running out of air/filter malfunctioning is gone due to the filter mechanics and filter availability being fixed.  Exploration is easier than ever.  There are many great set pieces to experience and even choices for the player to make regarding the fate of certain story characters. 

The DLC missions tend to focus on a particular play style since you often are playing as a soldier with a specific role (sniper, gunner, etc.).  There is not much explorationin the DLC as the main game, though you will get to use some weapons unique to the DLC and experience more great set pieces.  The Spider Lair, sniper infiltration, scavenger, and Khan missions were my favorites.            

(Design)

Sometimes when I started the game up, it would crash at the ""Push Start"" screen.  I'm not sure what causes this but starting the game in safe mode and then changing the settings is a viable work-around.  Even on low, the game looks great.  Sound, ambience, and lighting are still unparalelled in my mind.  Creatures look great and display some impressive animations.  Humans act like humans for the most part: become alert, try to find you, take cover, return to idle if they do not find you, throw grenades, flank, etc.  Hit animations are one of the game's strong points, with humans moving and reacting accordingly depending on where you hit them and what you hit them with.  The music choices are appropriately somber with the tempo picking up for action sequences.  The set pieces of this game are incredible and you can tell a lot of effort was put into them.  Play the game in Russian with English subtitles as the English voiceover is notorious in places.  

(Final Comments)

Metro: Last Light does a wonderful job of concluding Artyom's story in the Metro universe.  Though somewhat familiar, the finale is quite impressive and resolves the nature of the Dark Ones.  I like 2033 for its tension and atmoshpere, but I find Last Light to be more playable and easier to enjoy.  I recommend Last Light for correcting 2033's more frustrating aspects, its great design, and epic conclusion to Artyom's story.  Grab your AK and delve deeper into the secrets of the Metro.

After well over 30 years of gaming, I think I know what is good, for me.  I am not whining, but this is for reviews, so here is my review ( not really just more of a bitch session...but this is where I am at, so far...) : 

#1 : I was PATIENTLY going through the FORCED beginning of the game (this should ALWAYS be a skippable CHOICE...), when I was on the train with the sniper lady...when I suddenly fell out of the train into the world and got stuck there, clipping like crazy and died.  Since there is no option for ME to CHOOSE to save (at least yet), I have to revert to the ""Load Last Checkpoint"" option.  This is great, since the last one saved happened to be right as I was entering no-man's land.   Yeah, I can restart the game, load that chapter, but I shouldn't have to.
 
#2 : I have been ""playing"" this ""game"" for close to half an hour, yet I have done nothing so far except follow one scripted scene to the next.  How long does it take to actually be on my own in the ""sandbox""?

#3 : If I can manage to wade through more of what I assume is still the ""intro"", I am assuming the game gets much better, so i will re-post if that happens.",1410637279,1410643220,False,1,0,0.48085486888885498,0,True,False,False

When I first played Metro 2033, it was the first game I played in Directx 11. Albeit a linear shooter, it was none the less an engrossing and captivating gaming experience. If you are interested at all in the post-apocalyptic shooter genre like STALKER, this game is for you.

Unlike its predecessor however, Metro: Last Light does not follow any novel written by Dmitry Glukhovsky although he did work with 4A Games during development.

You start the game as Artyom who you might remember was the protaganist from the first game, your mission is to find and capture a 'Dark One' to help end the war on humanity, during this mission you'll spend the majority of your time in the dark tunnels of the metro where the gameplay is tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat with amazing sound design making your heartbeat race with every twist and turn.

The rest of the time is spent on the surface where radiation is at its highest and gas masks must be worn, this is where you'll encounter most of this games monstrositys (Other than the Russians) and see it's most breathtaking sights with a graphical engine that is one of the best I've seen in years. 

Unfortunately this is where I lost my love for the game, I found myself constantly running out of filters for my gas mask and having to use it for seconds at a time which meant that I had to run through some of the games best areas and had no time to take it in. After taking my gas mask on and off about 100 times I began to feel tedium in large amounts.

Then there's the boss fights, despite conserving all my ammo as much as possible throughout the game I found that the boss fights used every single bit of ammo I had stored, then after the fight I found myself with no ammo facing a horde of enemies which I could not beat with just my knife, I had to reload my last chapter. Not good.

Still, you could do far worse than Metro: Last Light, the sights and sounds will blow you away and the story is a 6 hour epic with a solid ending that I think everyone should experience at least once.

Score: 3/5

Metro Last Light, in my opinion, is a huge improvement over its predeccessor which I tried it out and haven't managed to finish it. But this, this was an engaging experience than 2033. I enjoyed the gameplay much more, which makes enemies much more 'killable'. Stealth works but it is too simplified, by that I mean the enemies literally can not see you when standing in front of them, the AI is also a bit problematic because, especially the humans they will just sprint around cover instead of trying to shoot. The morality is also very complex as you may not notice if your karma is good or bad, this affects the ending so be wary of your venture. The game is quite easy to pass too as I haven't died over 10 times - especially stealth missions because of the aforementioned problems. For the graphics it is amazing. The campaign while has nothing really that interesting, it is very atmospheric and the levels are quite varied. I managed to finish this within 11 hours so it is a fairly short game.

This game isn't for everyone, on the lower difficulties you can just breeze through it without having to worry about ammo, health or being stealthy, but if you plan on trying to move up to Hardcore or Ranger mode, you have to be prepared to use stealth because you just won't survive the stretches of the game where you're on the surface fighting mutants rather than humans since you can't loot ammo from monsters (that would just be ridiculous) and that's where I feel it could put someone off since you have to restrain yourself from trying to Rambo your way through the game and at times it requires a substantial amount of patience.

I heard about it for a while, but I never got the chance to play it yet. This game was recommended to me over the first, and I was told that you could dive right into the story without too much confusion. To my surprise, they were right!

I enjoyed this game thoroughly, and I recommend it to anybody who likes dark, claustrophobic environments and survival-horror-esqe atmosphere. I enjoyed it so much that the moment I was done playing the story first time around, I immediately played again on a harder difficulty. You can easily get sucked into the world of Metro through this game, and it has many points where you take in the amazing scenery through evesdropping segments.

The tunnels and surface of the world are littered with several mutant beasts that will easily get the drop on you if you go unprepared, and they can be quite terrifying at points. Note that if you have a fear of spiders, this game WILL creep you out.
Stealth is a key element in this game. It is oh so satisfying to sneak up on enemies, knock them out or knife them, then pump silencer rounds into his unsuspecting friends!

Finally, I should mention that the DLC is worth the money. Get the Season Pass DLC if you are interested, as it will add a few hours onto your game for about $10 (or less if it is on sale). The only DLC I do not reccomend is Ranger Mode. We should not have to pay for a difficulty setting.

Metro: Last Light is a good game. For a cheap buy on the store it is well worth the money. Playing through the game, I didn't come across any major faults. I actually thought it looked pretty good actually. 

During some of the missions I found it to be a little vague in what directions you needed to go in. There was no indication on what/ which way or thing you had to do. A few hours into the game I found it iritatingly dark. Yes I get it, it is supposed to be dark, and they do supply you with night vision goggles and a flashlight, but even still.

  [i]4A Games[/i] is evidently from Malta, was previously backed by the once venerable [i]THQ[/i], is currently working with [i]Deep Silver[/i] (a developer/producer on more than one series that I like) and most notably has people with some historical connections to [u]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/u], which definitely shows in the Metro games since both of these intellectual properties do a first rate job of presenting powerful and tense experiences in survival gameplay.

  A few of the big points this game has going for it:
[list]
    [*]Based on a novel
    [*]Absolutely top-notch visual and audio fidelity
    [*]Stealth gameplay encouraged and supported by features/mechanics, enemy AI and level design
    [*]Highly intense, atmospheric and immersive
[/list]

  Glukhovsky's setting is prime for exploring this story which is something of a commentary on society and the nature of humanity.  While I don't like everything about it (some parts feel contrived or unbelievable), I can say with confidence that it is a unique and engrossing plot that plays nicely upon traditional aspects of post-apoc but also utilizes the different factions (Communist Reds, Fourth Reich Neo-Nazis, independent traders, the Polis rangers, etc.) and the science fiction elements to present a post-apoc wasteland you won't find elsewhere in this oversaturated genre.  Can't provide any specifics without giving something away.  As an avid reader, I enthusiastically endorse games adapted from good books.

  There is so much fun to be had in the M:LL gameplay.  Weapons and their customizations provide decent progression and an acceptable range of playstyle options.  The beauty of M:LL's gameplay comes out in the stealth.  On the ideal difficulty and mode, the campaign should truly feel like a fight for survival against either deadly enemy troops or monstrous, mutated wildlife.  Artificial intelligence, the area design in both confined and spread out levels, the desperate scarcity of ammunition, supplies and safe haven and especially the mechanic for light sources and visual/audible detection all support and encourage player stealth.  Go for that infrared scope and the silencer over the extended mag and double barrel!  It might make the difference.  I appreciate any game that always rewards stealth and sometimes requires it.  

  With settings on the high end, the graphics look breathtaking in certain spots, and extremely good overall with some very cool effects like the misty breath in cold air, the condensation (or dirt, or blood) on the gas mask, weather effects, etc.  Concept art for some of the creatures and places are phenomenal.  The audio quality is much appreciated too, whether in the satisfying weaponry or in creeping through the pitch dark with hungry critters lurking nearby.  Visual/audio have just as big an impact as the gameplay elements on creating such an immersive, atmospheric and intense experience.  Technically M:LL is sound although it will stress even a high end machine.  Just make sure your drivers are up to date and be aware that any issue you may have has probably been solved by now in a thread on the Steam forums or elsewhere, unless you simply don't meet the minimum specifications.

  The whole package is pretty darned well executed, and while not every aspect of game design and development are pushing the envelope here, the game in my opinion deserves a slightly higher critical rating than it received at launch.  One other note I feel must be made is that this game was intended for guys, not girls.  There are more than a few entirely gratuitous scenes which most women will not appreciate.  Not something to play when your girlfriend, sister, or anyone else might sneak a glance at the screen.

  I tried or finished all of the DLC content and the only one I didn't enjoy quite so much was the [u]Tower Pack[/u]: while it was fun for a bit, I found the challenges too difficult to overcome and not really worth my time and trouble since it was a self-contained simulator.  Leaderboards don't do much for me usually.  As for the rest, I very much enjoyed the side chapters showcasing other characters from the story.  I also really liked the faction missions.  Those are all short but fun and should definitely be finished.  The developer pack was of passing interest, nice for checking out all the wild character and critter models.  My favorite DLC without question was the one concerning Kshatriya, even though two of the artifacts eluded my search.  That DLC was a nice jolt of nostalgia from my time roaming the wasteland in [u]Fallout[/u] games.  Play through Kshatriya and don't get discouraged by one or two deaths!

  I highly recommend M:LL and its predecessor, 2033 to any guy who wants a great looking, linear post-apocalypse FPS campaign with a story and setting that stand apart in small ways from the other entries to the genre.

TIP: For the intended survival-horror experience that Metro: Last Light offers, it must be played on Ranger difficulty with ""Ranger Mode"" activated.  This will force you to fight or flee by the skin of your teeth.  If it gets to be too much you can always lower the difficulty (I had to at times).
TIP: While I said stealth is king here, it really helps to have one hard hitting gun in your lineup for when things fall apart.
TIP: Don't treat your bullets, medpacs or mask filters like candy!
TIP: Be mindful of details around you (especially in Kshatriya) and you'll survive.
TIP: In Kshatriya don't forget to return to base and rest after clearing [i]each[/i] new area before moving on, or you might lose that progress to an unexpected death.",1409270706,1409270904,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

However, I don't recommend any of the DLC. 
They are either too short for the most part, which doesn't really give you all that much entertainment

OR

They are the Tower or the Developers pack.

The Tower is incredibly hard, and I have to say I like being ranked against my peers depending on speed and performance, but IT WILL ERASE YOUR PROGRESS. so fuck that. You'd think you'd be able to stop after beating the second level (after playing for a couple hours), but that's a mistake I made. Came back the next day, no saves, had to start over. So fuck that unless you like winning by what is basically luck, and then having to do it again. . . Sigh.

The dev pack is a slaughterfest, turns Metro into a grenade lobbing hack n slash ultra frenzy on the arena, or a stand still burst shotting things over and over in the gun range . But you get to play around with every gun imaginable, so I guess if you are into that, it's pretty cool. Some kind of save function exists in this mode, just make sure not to use it until you actually want to save. I pressed it out of curiosity, finished the gun range, and half the arena, came back the next day and it was all gone.

last light is a very atmospheric game.  

While it is for the most part fairly linear you do get a variety of different ways to get by.  You can go all out and kill everything or you can stealth around the place blowing out lights and slitting throats.   Either way you will probably get several playthroughs worth of entertainment trying to get the ""good"" ending you thought you would already get.  Plus there are a few achievements that are fun to try and get (no detection/kill completions).

What I find most appealing is the setting of the game.  I like seeing how people try to survive in the world that the Metro game creates.  It is a very beliveable environment, and is enhanced by the NPC conversations and goings on of the people just trying to live in the various Metro ""cities"" you visit.  I also enjoy (to a degree) the fact you dont have obvious directions and that you can run out of ammo, filters and die like the many fallen bodies you find scattered around.

Play time on normal probably around 10-12 hours.  Plus additional time if you play the various DLC.
DLC content is not obvious to find.  Its in the chapters section. they are a mixed bunch, I enjoyed the library level the best for its very realistic feeling of what it would be like to be a scavenger.

You can choose to stealth/sneak past your enemies with the help of putting lights out and knife kill (slice their throats) some of them or you can just rush in and blow all their heads off (that's what i did).

The story is beautiful, loved the last dark one and the multiple ""political"" parties that are engaging eachother to populate the underground metro. The scenery is very nice, an abbandoned ground level Moscow in ruins, old rusted cars, blown up buildings, collapsed bridges, crashed airplanes and scary mutated animals. The people live in the old metro tunnels and stations, wich are all connected to eachother obviously. U even get to ride a pimped up railway cart!

You u can play it head-on or sneaky. Although head-on is probably harder.

Far to long in combat with boss type creatures and you have to do certain actions or you lose.
There is no time to take in the area your in, ie: gasmask filter time is way to short, hell the real ones last a hell of a lot longer.
Why can you not buy said filters, medi kits, etc; even at a price it would let you look around.

 Apart from that this game is well worth the price, well voiced with a very good feel for where you are, combat overall is good and the limited buying power fits well with the setting.

-Great graphics, but can be toned down for lower spec computers by turning off Advanced Physx with little effect to the games look.
-Great ambient sound.
-Very well done stealth gameplay.
-A far larger arsenal than 2033, with interesting and unique guns, not only in aesthetics but in play as well.
-A limited amount of options for gun customization, but every attachment has very specific functions.
-Heroes and villians with meaningful and deep stories.
-Great gunplay.
-Immersive HUD elements that aid immersion in general.
-Although it is very simple in the beginning, the story is still really good.
-Quite a challenge.
-Lots of seperate missions in the chapter screen.
-The Little One is a badass

Cons:
-Difficulty spikes at random. Especially on the Marsh levels, which I thought were awful.
-Although the story is good for the most part, the ending was personally dissapointing. (Edit: There are two different endings, and I got the bad one. I'll see if the other one is better.)
-Some of the factions are immersion breaking. Why is their an entire faction of neo-nazi Germans in the Russian metro?
-Too many sections where you have to wait for a slow elevator/vehicle to get to your position.
-(Nitpicking) Despite me going pretty much entirely non-lethal, many cutscenes don't acknowledge it and still act like I killed everybody.
-Anna. We knew her for about 5 minutes, during which she left us for dead with the Reich, then later met up with her after a week in which we again were with her for about 5 minutes, and suddenly we have sex with her for no reason.

The game was a good 10 hours, and honestly I got so addicted to it once my framerate issue was fixed I pretty much did it in one sitting...which is very uncommon for me nowadays.

At first glance it seems like another generic post apocalyptic shooter, but trust me it defintetly is not. The games atmosphere is what initially hooked me into the game. If you have a good PC the graphics in the game are breathtaking. The world of the underground metro is truly unique in its color palete and general eeriness. The world above groud is even more beatiful and unique to look at, but also just as frightning since you must have a gas mask on at all times or risk suffocation. 

The characters is Metro: Last Light are so-so to say the best however. The only ones really peaking my interest being Pavel and the Dark One. Anna becomes pretty one dimentional by the middle of the game and doesnt improve. While Artyom himself strangely remains silent throughout the entire game , with the expection of loading screens. The story itself kept me hooked from beginning to end and without giving any spoilers, has few intersting twists and turns in it.

The gameplay was a pleasant suprise for me personally. The wide range of guns keep things interesting. But the game mechanic that make bullets and currency one and the same really makes this unique. Essentially you buy guns, upgrades and special weapons all with bullets. The human enemies in the game are pretty easy to stealth by and also not to much of a challenge in a full on gun fight. Its the mutated creatures you fight in the game that will give you a run for your bullets (see what I did there?) Some will take entire clips to take down while others attack in groups making it extremly difficult to aim.

On Rails--one of the main themes of the Metro series, which also very concisely sums up the gaming experience.  Here's a world I might have liked to explored, but the cruel train of fate keeps moving inexorably towards its predetermined destination.  Life can be like that--which is a big reason people escape to video games.  I guess not every game needs to be an open-world experience.  I guess there are multiple endings to this one, but one play through of this is enough for me.  It was okay for $5 but now I'm just glad it's over.  I would never, ever, pay for the ""Redux.""

Besides the deterministic, overly-scripted plot, one annoyance was the checkpoint system, which at times can save your progess in a way that makes it impossible to continue. Your only option will be to restart the Chapter, and relive every scripted event (pretty much all events) at least one more time. Fun, fun!

This Game is Awesome.

 The atmospheric style; fog, spider webs, fire and gas, it all adds to the game's absolutely stunning post apocalyptic setting. At one moment, you're making your way through a downtroden gangster station, next you could be in a tunnel, spider webs everywhere with your biggest arachnophobic adversary lurking in the shadows. The Game's stealth mechanics are a great overhaul from 2033's system, shooting a silenced weapon won't alert everybody in the room if you miss and stealth takedowns and KO's give a variety between a stealth based infiltrator or throat cutting assassin. The graphics, although buggy at first (NVIDIA PhysX Drivers need updating) are also stunning and provide a real depth and feel to the dark tunnels of the Metro.

I'll start off firstly with this, I am in no way a person who makes reviews often at all, it's a great rarity, but with this game it deserves my praise. Metro: Last Light is a spectacular game that perfectally envisions a post-apocalyptic world with its high end graphics and visuals, as well as gameplay. Its story element adds to the overall experience in connecting you deeply with the dark Metro tunnels of Moscow, while being free to some extent to make certain moral choices and decisions to take side paths to explore little nooks and crannies for extra bullets to sell and upgrade your weaponry or just to simply keep your gun loaded up in case of mutant attacks on the path to saving the whole Metro from a terrible war from within the last remains of human civilisation. I found the story absolutely riveting in the constant near misses with death and need for going out of the way to get to a place due to an impassable obstacle. The game felt quite authentic in its harshness, especially with ranger mode activated for extra realism for more hardcore survivalism.

I believe this game literally can place you within the virtual world with the fear of creaping around deadly beasts and sudden onslaughts of mutated creatures from holes in the wall or from within the dark, the need for light or simple nightvision in this game is essential to getting through without being ripped to shreds in the darkness. The music and ambience have been beautifully selected and made for each chapter of the game, adding further connection and deepening the relationship with the environment that you traverse through and over. 

I'm very hard to please when it comes to games these days, I use to play anything that looked mildly good but now I keep myself to the games in which true thought and effort have prevaded over the desire for money grabbing and a quick profit. I overall rate my experience with this game as 10/10, that puts it up in the top 10 of my favorite games, a very hard place to get to. I had never touched anything post-apocalyptic or straight out apocalyptic before this, afterwards I went and played a number of of them and have yet to find one that matches the positive experience I've had with this game, none have engage me and kept me coming back and replaying the same story over and over.

This game is a definite must try game for anyone into games, it'll be an experience unlike that which you will often find nowadays in the game industry.",1408528370,1408703271,True,3,0,0.558800876140594482,5,True,False,False

It is identical to Human Revolution's problem where the boss fights seemed like they only existed to take away your resources and actively fucked you over if you were a full stealth build. The low FOV needs a config file to fix and all the graphics options are hidden in the same file so this game takes a lot of work to even get up to standards. This is one of those games you really have to put in a lot of effort into to actually enjoy the game, just like the first except the stealth is way better if not simplified. Whoever fucking thought that it was a good idea to turn of essential UI elements in ranger mode is also a fucking moron. Hold tab and move your mouse up, left, right, and down to select items to use? Oh but the entire HUD is gone so the tab screen isn't there and you have to hope you fucking selected the right one by sound. How much total ammo do you have? Well the only way to know is to go to a fucking store. Hey you know that sweet cutscene you were watching? Turns out it was a quicktime event and you're dead now, good thing we told you to smash buttons, WAIT NO WE FUCKING DIDN'T! As an extra fuck you we also only let you have two weapons in ranger mode, but what's that? Monsters take fucktons of ammo which you won't have on ranger mode? Hope you like having only one weapon choice then, because the other one is required to be a fucking shotgun now! So much for ""the way it was meant to be played"" ranger mode. Side note, I got so pissed at this game it made me punch my desk many times and not only that, but one of said punches made my computer blue screen and all because they added mandatory combat sections to a game that encourages stealth in every other part of the game BUT the mandatory combat sections, it's pretty FUCKING great... stop doing this please.",1408684385,1408684385,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game, is a work of art. I'm not even finished my first play through yet, but I say it doesn't matter how it ends, this will be one of the best games I have ever had the privlage of playing. The lighting IS the game, and yet it is also a very small part of a bigger picture. Creepy atmospheric area's, double crossing plot lines, compelling story, everywhere you walk where there are people, you can overhear more and more conversations, that just add to the story. you start to feel like everything everyone says is relevant somehow. Every person you come across in the game has depth, from the lowest beggar hiding in the corner, to the children flitting about the peripherals laughing and taunting. The music and sounds are well done, and the voice acting is pretty impressive to say the least. There are few games that transcend the medium to become art, this game is one of them. Remember that feeling of awe when you beat contra? Remember how awesome it was when you finally defeated gigas in earthbound and all those pictures the picture dude took of you came flooding back during the credits? How epic you felt after beating Metal Gear solid in under 2 hours to get the bandana that gives you infinite ammo? Or how touched and vengeful you felt after Aeris was killed by sepherioth and she fell into the fountain?

1. An issue that a lot of games can't seem to get past, fricking quicktime events. 
They were old in 2005 and now it is just getting awkward. Metro I think attempts to lighten the annoyance by making it just simple ""press E"" moments, but this just makes it even clearer that it is entirely pointless for it to be there. You spend 10 minutes getting through a zone and then have to reload and do it again just because some stupid little event wanted you to press E to hold onto a railing.

2. Awful AI and Stealth. 
The AI in this game is seriously terrible. Being in 'shadow' means you can pretty much urinate on a guards leg and give him wet willies and he will just be like ""I guess I have been drinking too much comrade"" and yet take out 2 guys split seconds apart with no other people in view, and if he gets off a ""huh?"" The entire game world is now running around screaming and looking for the intruder. It is just unenjoyable to deal with. The take downs are the worst I have ever seen, they do literally nothing that just knifing doesn't do, except it does an animation which leaves you standing there to be seen for 3 seconds. I figured out quickly that if you just don't look at your target and hit knife then move into line with them it is so much easier.

3. Oh noes we broke down, protect us while I start the engine. 
This crap, again, was old after about the 18th Call of Duty. Enemies coming at you in basic patterns while you are waiting for some retard AI to open a door for you. At one point some creatures were literally jumping onto the side of a rail car and staring into the barrel of the player's shotgun like ""hello, would you like to shoot me? Let me know, I am just hanging out for a while."" It is absolutely nothing but boring filler and there is way too much of it.

4. Annoying enemies. 
This one is hard to describe, but basically I found far too many enemies just plain annoying. Spiders that you can only kill by shining a torch on them, but they only come at you when you don't shine a torch on them, then when they come at you and you shine a torch on them, they run away so you can't shine a torch on them. It is absolutely spastic. Challenging is different to annoying. This one I will admit could be put down as just pet peeves, but I can't stand enemies in games that are more annoying than they are difficult.


Aside from a very few other minor things, like some questionable voice acting and the need to have the first female character to enter the story say ""stop staring at my ass"" within about 2 minutes, the game does live up to its reputation. The setting is constructed extremely well, the story well thought out and the graphics quite stunning once you ensure you have your system setup properly for it. It really is just shame the game design was obviously taken care of by someone who played through the entire COD franchise, cracked their knuckles and then said ""don't worry guys, I got this.""",1408645399,1408645399,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay just doesn't feels fluid.

For me a total differnce to for instance id games, where running around and shooting actually always feels good.  I have a 770gtx and 8core processorr 24GB ram - I dont have a game where i have to reduce game quality below high. But perhaps u must have two titans to play this game...

The graphics in this game are breath taking and the story is orginal and captivating. It creates an atmosphere you wont forget. I aquired this game in the sale for £4.99 and was worth every penny. My only con about the whole game is that I want more! 

Note: I have seen many problems reported with low FPS. Check your settings! If your using an old Nvidia card or AMD card turn off PhysX. Also set you SSAA to 0 it isnt required and kills your FPS. As long as you have the power in your system it should run perfectly and on full settings 1080 it is amazing!

It runs an average of 100 FPS on my system which is very high end so it is possible.

Very Solid gameplay and storyline 8 out of 10. 
A epic sequal to its predecessor Metro 2033 and a mind blowing ending for the Metro sequal. 
Honestly I think that it is probably one of the top 2013 games.

Graphics is a 9 out of 10 with impressive World Design, very detail and rich enviroment. 
-Played this game on Ultra visual settings (everything maxed out) and I could say that it definitely ultilized all that power from my r290x Tri-fire at a 5760x1080 resolution. 
*Although I would like to point out that this game doesn't really work that well on multiple display, took me quite sometime to find the solution (which works perfectly after that).

I would give a 10 out of 10 for audio as it is one of the very few games that fully optimized and ultilize a 7.1 surround sound headset. The ambiance, sound effect and music is off the charts.

Do note that this is a hardware reliable game.

You must take up arms once more to save the metro from impending doom (!!!!1!). This time, however, the threat is much closer to home.
  At every turn, you will be reminded of the desolation of the nuclear catastrophe that ended the world as we know it. The ghosts of the dead, the ruins of Moscow and once-great landmarks like the Kremlin, and the dirty, shambolic metro townships all elicit some measure of the despair and sadness that plagues what is left of humanity as they attempt to survive the grave new world their destruction has left behind. The top-notch graphics and sound-work make the world extremely immersive and realistic.
   The gameplay fits well with the atmosphere the game provides, with scarce ammunition, the bullet currency system, deadly enemies and regular stealth sections all coming together to give the impression of bare-knuckled survival. The enemy AI is a bit lacklustre at times, but this is only noticeable in a few cases. It generally makes you feel very vulnerable and threatened at all times. For a game made by a relatively small team of developers, this is an awesome achievement!

I'm primarily a RPG player but delve into action/FPS, adventure, and other genres heavily as well.  With that in mind, I find the repetitive FPS shoot-em ups tedious and Metro certainly looked like this on the surface.  It's not.  It's very story-rich and relies heavily on stealth components, which it employs exceptionally well.  I picked it up at 75% off for $5 complete.  So far it's been one of the best contemporary shooters I've played, and by far the most cerebral, not just in story, but in overall design.  Such very little touches to gameplay mechanics and level design such has having to wipe off your mask or unscrew bulbs (which you can also shoot out from afar, silencer recommended) are ingenious touches that suck the player into the environment and story.  From the very first real mission, where your sniper partner takes an eagle's eye vantage point of the field you need to traverse, the NPCs are integral parts of the story-telling process, not developer dangled marionettes hanging solely for the purpose of handing out tasks or acting as glorified buffs.  The world is conversation rich and little details like surprising a soldier in his bunk and his immediate pleas of surrender are all voiced impeccably.  And is it fun to play?  Well... if you're looking for a game to run around in like a headless chicken, jumping and ducking to dodge bullets while spewing mobs with endless streams of lead, then no, this game isn't for you.  Nor is it for you if you're looking for a super tough enemy AI.  Nor is it for you if you don't like linear gameplay.  With that said, everything that it does right just might outweigh these ""flaws"" for you, and you should prbably give it a go anyway.

(SPOILERS INBOUND FOR 2033 AND LAST LIGHT) Though it's /very/ graphic intensive, reducing the gameplay for those of us with lesser computers (a la me), this game still provides an awesome experience. Whether a stealth fighter or an all-out brawler, this game has combat for everyone, and a story for the ages. The new arena of Russian subways is a definite refresher too. Taking place after Metro: 2033 ending where you destroy the Dark Ones, Artyom must now find a Dark One that survived, a baby. Once you find him, he knocks you out, taking you on a wild ride towards Polis through a wartime Metro. The discovery of D6 has forced every faction to its limits, and everyone's on edge. This game probably has a good 10 or 15 hours in for the single player mode, and even more time if one does the extra chapters (which are FANTASTIC, I would definitely reccommend the Developer Pack, the Pavel Pack for stealth fighters, Kshatria [I think], and the Sniper Pack for snipers). There are a few bugs that force you to reload the game, and sometimes the fighting can get a little bland for outright shooters, but otherwise, 9.5/10, definitely recommend.

Survival in a world that clearly no longer has humanity in mind: a poisonous world shattered by nuclear war where humanity can only live where filtered air can be found... but life goes on, mutants not only existing but thriving in twilight of humanity.

Weapons are varied: rifles, pistols, SMGs, shotguns, miniguns, and pneumatic pellet rifles, all of which can be customized in a multitude of ways. Prefer stealth? Add silencers and light-amplification scopes. Want more range? Add barrel extenders and magnification scopes. A few various stocks can also be added for additional stability.

Military grade ammo, as opposed to recycled/made post-war ammo, can be spent in two ways: as the only universal currency of the Metro, or to add more punch to your weapons in times of dire need. Choose wisely...

Gas masks and filters are a must in order to explore the surface... filters are only good for a limited time before replacement, while masks can grow dirty (thankfully you can wipe them off), or far worse, crack and shatter, making you scurry about looking for a replacement.

I've only read the first book, Metro 2033 (and played the same-titled THQ video game) and can say Last Light lives up to the atmosphere of both and gives a decent story to follow... does it follow the story of the other two books?

Each level you play more and more of the story unfold , and what a dark and dystopian story it is. For me the experience was like reading a book I could not put down , I had to know how the plot would unfold. It is not a perfect game  the narrative is a bit uneven at times and some elements of the game play are a bit ho hum.

The variety of enemies is minorly expanded upon in this game, with a couple water-based mutants and some unique boss battle types. The biggest change for enemies is the AI; all the enemies--especially humans--are much less observant of their surroundings, making stealth a larger priority in this game than its predecessor.
Combat and exploration are also changed for the better, for all of Artyom's movements are more concise and he has a larger arsenal than previously, and all of the mechanics from the last game (gas masks, radiation, darkness) are implemented in finer, less jumbled ways and can be kept track of much easier.
Unfortunately, the narrative did seem to depart from what made Metro 2033 so interesting and grant Metro: Last Light a wider scope of subjects to address. In other games, this would be good, but the Metro franchise benefits more from the tunnel-visioned, mission-oriented approach than the cover-all-the-genres approach. It's not bad, but don't expect it to have the charm you might have experienced in the first game.

Metro: Last Light is a bold post-apocalyptic FPS adventure uniquely told from the Russian point of view. Last Light’s setting and presentation are its strong points, though the last third of its 10-hour campaign is weaker than everything that came before it.

The game ties real world events and the lore of the Metro books to create a very immersive and believable world. The story has you fighting against Nazi's, the red army, bandits and the abdominations of the apocalypse all in great story based fashion, as you struggle for survival. The environments are all beautiful and unique, even when you transverse tunnels and the graphics are equally beautiful to compliment this. The gameplay itself is your standard first person shooter fare, albeit it offers true stealth and survival components (depending on difficulty, more forced to stealth and managing every bullet), and it is the stealth that this game does well, where the AI aren't completely oblivious nor are they overly alert and respond in a manner that will have your hair standing on end. The main storyline is enriching and the cast of characters are unique, this complemented with the main characters monologues really involve you in the world. As for the bad, this game does have its fair share of bugs and hangups, as such you will spend a fair amount of time restarting or playing with settings in order to manage said issues if you can. Some people may experience the game trouble free but judging from what was experienced and read, they are the minority. Still however I give this game a full recommendation, its a single player shooter experience like no other and is well worth the time and money.

  Metro: Last Light is a sequal to Metro 2033, and I can say it is a vast improvment of it's predecessor.
Metro LL made me so scared while playing. I vowed to only play this game in the dark, and I swear I had trouble sleeping after I played it! Metro Last Light starts off after the ""negative"" ending of Metro 2033. Without spoiling the story, it is truley an achievment worthy of praise. I actually liked the game in every aspect. The enviorment is dark and sinister, you know, like a nuclear metro system. The gunplay is top notch and very (Not over exaggerating) intoxicating. I felt involved in every gun fight. I never was dissapointed a single minute while playing! Except for a surprise lap dance half way through the game, that was...well...awkward.

   I must mention that before you load this up on PC, the game is demanding. I am runnning currently a Nvidia GTX 650 at decent cloak speeds. TURN OFF ADVANCED PHYSX AND DIRECTX11.0 SETTINGS IF YOU ARE GETTING POOR PERFORMANCE. While performance is usually better than quality, I would say that you may want to run everything on medium-high settings if you can, without advanced PhysX. The game is beautiful on higher settings, it's better than most games even on low settings!

  My final conclusion, if you enjoy the FPS genre, the gunplay may be worth it buying. If you enjoy intense games, it is a must own. If you are on the fence about this game, buy it. No question. Final score. 9/10 (Lost a point for not enough Pavel.-  :P  )

Gameplay:

-- Guns are fantastic; ammo is just scarce enough; 
-- melee weapons are actually useful;
-- stealth is not only very useful but possible for players (like me) who aren't so good at it (because it's done is such a way as it seems intuitive);
-- the atmosphere they've created is nothing short of amazing;

[b]Here is what I experienced during my 9 hour playthrough:[/b]

The atmosphere is really, really good! You get the feeling of a very dark and grim future where everything is out to kill you and live has become tough. You walk old lines of the Metro and get a very ""run down"" and sometimes ""steampunky"" feeling when you look around and see all the machines and buildings. The sounds adds to that quiet nicely. With the smudgy sound beneath your feet, when you walk through the slug and the wind, blowing through the corridors. I have to say, though, the whole story looks a bit to militarized to me. You hardly ever talk to ordinary citizens of the Metro. Most of the time you spend alone sneaking/killing your way through the surface or underground. When you meet someone, who doesn't want to blow your head off, it's mostly other soldiers. The only instances of you seeing citizens, is when the game wants to show you, how miserable the are or when you need to do a sidequest. The dialogues are okay, but I personally don#t like the Russian ascents of, what feels like 90% of the people. Yes, it plays out in Russia, but since we also have Nazis there, why isn't anyone else there? Also, why do Russian people speak English all the time?! I guess that is nitpicking but it really annoyed me. 

The gameplay is the worst part for me in the entire game. The weapons don't feel good, since any enemy needs tons of bullets unless you aim for the head.  Also the game seems heavily focused on stealth. I say this, because stealth is a lot easier than gunning everyone down. Sadly the stealth mechanics are pretty minimalistic: You can turn off most light sources (either by shooting or by interacting) and you can use silenced weapons. Also you have the ability to ""stealthkill"" when you catch an enemy off guard. You can also decide to just knock them out or kill them, which is part of a system to get different endings. A very interesting thing I noticed was, when you stand in a shadow, you are basically invisible. And with this I mean invisible! As long as you don't create a lot of noise or collide with anyone, you can run around like the wind. You can stand 1 meter in front of an enemy, the won't see you. If you get spotted the enemy AI will try to attack you and use cover (most of the time) and is pretty good at shooting (again, most of the time), though sometimes the AI just breaks down and NPCs run literally in circles.

The thing that really bugged me was the pacing of the game. It always seemed to me as if the developers wanted me to do one thing at a time extensively. When you fight enemies, you fight tones of them. You talk to people, you talk for 10 minutes. Fighting humans was still more enjoyable than fighting mutants. Those come at you in large packs and in waves. You can hardly use stealth and therefore fighting tactically is out of the question. As a result you just shoot and shoot. 

In short: I cannot recommend this game, since it is simply mediocre. The atmosphere is good but if you want a game for that, get bioshock 1 / 2 / infinite.

I'm really on the edge with this one.. Sometimes the game is fantastic and lot of fun but then the game saves a checkpoint while you're dying and just gives you the middle finger. Can't load a previous checkpoint so you have to restart the entire freaking chapter.

Why? Just why? Why would you think that a game entirely based on checkpoints wouldn't need to save more than one freaking checkpoint.
And then why wouldn't you patch it once you realized you screwed up?

Also, the game feels great as long as you are in control of your situation, but when they make you defend a spot or script a ton of creatures to attack you 'cause you HAD to press that button that makes lots of noises, not so cool, especially as repetitive as it is in this game.

Metro Last Light is a fun stealth\shooter hybrid that none the less is the most sexist game I've played in recent memory. The only women are either defined by the roles of child-bearer/care-taker or are defined by the males around them. The greatest example of this is your supposed sidekick, who shows up at the start to mock you, does nothing to stop you getting captured, then randomly appears later with an abrupt 360 personality change. Worse, the sidekick is the only woman I've seen carrying a gun in the entire game (so she is also the only female ranger, for no reason)!

If the rest of the game weren't fun, I'd easily dismiss Metro as a waste of time. However, poor story and odd character choices do little to mar the effective atmosphere or the combat. The atmosphere is as moody and poignant as it was in Metro 2033, although a few sections suffer from overly-liner-Call-of-Duty-handholding. The combat has been upgraded, with guns now proving far more enjoyable to use. In addition, a decent stealth system has been combined with refined AI to make sneaking a fun alternative to guns-blazing, and a must for higher difficulty levels.

Metro Last Light is worth it for sexist dirtbags and normal people alike. If your easily peeved by poor representations of women and minorities, steer clear.

This game is not without flaws at the creative level, and yet despite any problems it may have is incredibly well executed from a technical perspective. Speaking perhaps more to the limitations of heavily linear first-person-shooter game design than anything else, this game possesses a wealth of passion for its subject matter that is promising for the future of 4A Games. Here are some things to consider if you’re trying to decide whether or not to buy Metro: Last Light:

+ Did you play and enjoy Metro 2033? If yes, then you will probably enjoy this one, too. If not, you will probably find this sequel confusing and irrelevant. This goes especially for PS3, Mac, and Linux users who may have been excluded from playing the first game due to limited publishing.

+ Do you have a mid-to-high-end PC? If yes, then you should definitely grab this game at some point because the visuals are some of the best I’ve ever seen. There are several new and interesting graphics technologies built into Metro: Last Light that you can’t even run without top of the line equipment. Conversely, if you have a console, you are really missing out on this one, and even if you do buy it, the experience may not be nearly as visually compelling.

+ Do you have strong opinions against nuclear war? If you do, then you should probably play this game. Let’s face it, the idea of a Western audience playing a game made in the former USSR, set in Russia, about what a bad idea nuclear war is, has to be a good thing for everyone. If you are pro-nuclear war, you should also play this game, and maybe having your highly-immersive virtual face gnawed off by a giant mutant rat will make you reconsider your views!

+ Do you like the idea of a game that strongly favors storytelling? If so, you may have mixed feelings about this game. Playing Metro: Last Light is like reading a book, written in the first person, where the author uses incredible and poetic descriptive language for every little thing that the protagonist encounters, but fails to actually have very much happen in terms of the story, and what does happen all in all feels disjointed, a little confusing, and like it missed a lot of opportunities.",1406701418,1406701418,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Metro LL is a game that shines so bright in some regards, but fails so terribly in others, that it's hard to describe it as merely a ""good"" or ""bad"" game. The successes of LL lie in graphics and gameplay: the lighting engine feels truly next-gen, the environments feel incredibly well crafted and cluttered with metro crud, the guns are loud, hit enemies hard, and have awesome reloads. Firefights with enemies are tense, although the human AI is poor, compared to the much more unpredictable creatures. Stealthing is exciting, although too easy, especially considering how it doesn't always flow cohesively into combat. Regarding general gameplay and graphics, I agree with everything in doc.ames review. The true issue with LL is its story.



Early on, LL provides the player with a character that helps them survive, and then decieves them. Immediately the player probably feels angry, but further information provided by the game throughout the storyline makes it evident that this character had no other choice: he was merely acting in his self interest. Sadly, it feels like LL does not truly capitalize on this fact: the character who befriended you is not rounded, and while I would have expected him to later have stated his reasons for needing to betray the player, he steadfastly sticks on with a ""can-do"" shoot-this-guy-in-the-face attitude. Any connection or empathy that could've been built on (and in my opinion, create character interaction of depth and complexity rarely seen in video gaming) is avoided to reiterate on this character's stubborn and singular personality - effectively, there are no deeper layers to his character displayed. 

The reason for this is likely to make the player hate him as much as possible, as it is part of the formula for reaching a ""better"" ending to save him. However, this approach makes the character player interaction more boring than anything as it fails to actually change a player's opinion. There is no strong reason for any player to change their view on the character in the game as it never directly approaches the issue of his betrayal: as stated earlier, any greater depth in his personality is never displayed, merely alluded to near the end of the game, and as so, most players will likely have decided to kill or spare him as their methods by which they judge him are never altered. 

Connecting with the character of Artyom in LL is an even worse blunder in the game's design. The player is given the role of Artyom in LL: they play as him and make his decisions. To kill or not to kill, to forgive or to hate. However, multiple times in the game, control is wrenched away from the player to allow the character of Artyom to make whatever choices he wants. This is poor design as the story operates on two types of ""role play gaming"".

The player is given control of Artyom at times in gameplay to make their own decisions. In these instances Artyom can be seen as a ""blank slate"", and he acts the part, being completely mute. Role playing in this instance is under the guise of the player projecting themselves as an adventurer within the metro's tunnels. At other times, scripted cutscenes define the choices Artyom makes without any player input. The role playing then becomes the player being inextricably tied to the character that is Artyom: a man with motives never clearly explained and an idealogy that is unchangeable, despite the storyline of the preceeding Metro 2033 implicating otherwise. 

This character duality frustrated me as I constantly felt incapable of making any well informed decisions whenever the capability was clearly presented. This is most evident in the game's ending, wherein the ""good"" ending is only unlocked should the player have played through the entire game as a saint. This relates back to changing the player's point of view on situations: the ending is not defined by whether the player changed their ideas about the inhabitants of the metro and their own humanity, but whether the player preemptively decided to save characters as this was their pre-existing idealogy. 

As such, when I changed my opinions on the people of the metro, specifically, when I came to understand that the people within the different and often terrifying factions of the metro were led on by fear and corruption rather than any belief in their factions actual ideology, I was unimpressed to find that this had no influence on the game's events. While lives were saved throughout the story, the actual feedback the game offers, specifically its ending, did not reflect any of this change. 

While the characters presented in the game are often given reasons for their actions, like the betraying character who must save his own skin, the game's main villain is COMPLETELY unexplained. What reasons he has to attempt to gain control of the metro in such a violent way are never explained, and in a game that at least attempts to humanize its characters, this is an incomprehensible design decision. 

Metro isn't always sucessful humanizing characters either, a prime example being the generic ""all too human"" female love interest met early on in the game. I could only sigh as Artyom made love to her not but ten hours game time after having met her, of which 15 minutes are spent in her actual company, as it didn't feel realistic in the slightest. The humanization of this character is nonexistant, as it merely is portrayed as a black and white change from a gruff to caring personality, and the fear this character feels, leading them to have coitus with Artyom, is contrived to the extreme. 

On top of it all, the character of Artyom is hard to identify with due to his own dialogue provided during the inter chapter loading screens oftentimes being at odds with the player controlled Artyom. Artyom, in his dialogue, speaks that he has doubts whether he should put any faith in the dark ones, while I myself had already decided to trust and help them, however possible. I could go on about other tonal inconsistencies and the mounds of character foibles, but this review is getting incredibly lengthy already. 



Metro LL is a game that sets out to improve upon its predecessor, and while the atmosphere, and in some circumstances the gameplay have evolved to become more enjoyable, the story has become obtuse and the characters two dimensional. The events and theme of the story are interesting, but it fails to involve or change the player in any way, despite having the capability of doing so. A gross failure of a plot, but an interesting FPS. More flawed than fun for those who enjoy a story.

The graphic is top notch and depicts gloomy yet beautiful post-apocalyptic atmosphere perfectly. With power of advanced 4a engine, its lighting effects and detailed character & texture expression is still impressive in today's standards. 

Its game mechanic is another great improvement. Unlike typical FPS counterparts, Last Light recommends you to play as a sneaky ninja since the level design includes several secret routes where you can find various ways to pass almost every stage undetected moving from shadow to shadow. So, throwing knives and silencers are must for those who want to be more ""stragic"".

Plus, the sound design is very clever. Whenever an enemy sees glimps of you and finally detects you, background music changes from slow tones to fast, intense tones. This is a cool feature in that a player easily recognizes its status by sound of the game.

However, since there is no ""perfect"" game in the universe, I can not turn away from this game's bull sh*ts either.

First off: bugs, those freaking bugs! If you have a pc with slightly lower specs than recommended, you will face tons of freezes every hour. Strictly speaking, after I got past first half of the game, my pc(i5-2500K, 8G RAM, AMD 6870) froze every time I played and it occured in every checkpoint I reached. What the hell? It has been almost two years from the release and 4A Games/Deep Silver did not even fix that? Again. What the hell!?

Without bugs, the game has still minor issues. Control and aiming are little bit stiff. Even though I maxed out the sensitivity, it feels clunky on intense combat. Sound tracks of Last Light are good but not that memorable. Impoved sneak system deprives players chance to use upgraded arms, which is ironic.

To sum up, Metro: Last Light has some serious malfunctions that is unforgiving but its beautiful environment and well designed game mechanics pay off for sure. $20 price is definetly worth for the unique experience it offers.

But rather than stand united, the station-cities of the Metro are locked in a struggle for the ultimate power, a doomsday device from the military vaults of D6. A civil war is stirring that could wipe humanity from the face of the earth forever.

It is a linear game, but the story is enjoyable. As an FPS it is enjoyable, lots of action if you want. It also serves as an enjoyable stealth game, with optional, paid DLC that can make combat more ""realistic"". In a given combat scenario, if you choose stealth you are likely going to have to work hard and die a few times until you figure out a solution (which paths to take, timing, who to kill). The optional paid DLC that makes combat more realistic also increases immersion to good effect, although there are some issues. For example when you press TAB to select your secondary weapon, the UI is disabled with this DLC and so you can't see--if you never played without the DLC, obviously that would be an issue. However in the end that DLC was worth it. The pacing of the story is sometimes off--there are a lot of things to listen to sometimes, but it can take a while (e.g. might have been better to spread this out). The story was enjoyable, and the role you play in it works. Neat little things in the game make it stand out. Game ran very well on Very High on an i5 4690 3.5, GTX 760, 8 GB RAM, although I had to disable Advanced PhyX because in certain areas (usually or only the long scripted events it seemed) the FPS would severly drop (disabling it and the problem was gone, not sure what it did in the first place).",1406241553,1406241649,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is painfully linear and will seem to be smirking at you every time at a key moment, it wrests control from you so you can watch a cutscene of yourself stumbling into some unpleasant situation.  The game's idea of challenge is low visibility in poorly designed maps in the dark, having to constantly wipe alien spunk, blood, and condensation off your visor to see what little you even can, and at one point, even making your flashlight just not work.  The parts fighting other humans are fun, but as the game progresses you will fight more and more mutants, which is tedious when the main challenge is simply to see them.

Get this game if you like fast paced FPS with plenty of visual florish and an action/stealth element (nothing nicer than hearing the ping as you silently shot an enemy in the helmet from the shadows and hear him drop to the floor).

I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale for extremely cheap, thinking I would get my moneys worth out of it no matter what.  While I certainly did enjoy playing it and there definitely were some great aspects to the game, there were several things that really bothered me.  However, I'll start with the positives first:

I'm a big fan of the post-apocalyptic settings of Fallout, The Last of Us, The Walking Dead, etc., so the setting of this game was, in my opinion, phenomenal.  Having never played a Metro game before this or read the book(s), I was going in blind other than what I had seen in previews.  The atmosphere of the game was also well done, everything felt just right.  There were times when I was on edge, crawling through tunnels lined with human remains and egg sacs of gaint spiderlike creatures with only 4 shots left in my revolver, and times when I really did feel a sigh of relief when arriving at the next ""hub"" area to restock on ammo and other equipment.  Speaking of the hub areas, they too were phenomenal.  They really felt alive, like each person in the town or city had their own backstory, as you could hear them speaking about their own issues and troubles as you walked by.  Gun customization was great as well and I absolutely loved that they didn't just use guns that are currently available in the real world.  There was a gun that shot ball bearings that needed to be hand pumped so that it could be pressurized to fire properly.  It really made it feel like guns were being built from improvised materials that could be found in The Metro.

Now, on to the negatives.  Firstly, and this might just be me, but I prefer to have the character I'm playing to have his own personality, unless I personally created the character.  It's weird to have your character be spoken to over and over again, yet stay completely silent.  Opposed to every other living creature in the game, Artyom (The main character of the game) has absolutely no personality, no dailogue outside of loading screens, nothing to make you feel emotionally attached to him.  He's just a dude who becomes the ""CHOSEN ONE"", that's really all you know about him.  Personally, this makes it really hard for me to get involved in the story.  Speaking of the story, it was really just kind of... ""eh."" I honeslty never felt myself getting interested in the story at all.  Another issue with the story was that everything was just felt so incredibly ""done before"". ---- *SPOILERS* (but not really because you end up guessing everything that's going to happen)  Dude finds out he is the CHOSEN ONE, people think he's full of shit, meets friend, friend betrays him, falls in love, gets revenge on ex-friend, etc. *END SPOILERS* ---- The story was just honestly too predictable the entire way through the game.
  Also, the AI feels pretty pathetic, especially with the other human enemies.  I had an entire gang run down a hallway single file right into my gun.  Even when the corpses of their fallen allies started filling up the end of the hallway, ""WOAH, HEY, WHAT THE HELLS GOING ON OUT HERE?!?!""

All in all, even with all the flaws, the game was still at least decently enjoyable.  The environment and tension created (ESPECIALLY from playing on Ranger Hardcore) is certainly enough to warrant a purchase of this game when it is on sale.  However, if what you're looking for is a rich, memorable story, I'd advise you to pass this one up.",1405790111,1405790247,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has its flaws but the variety, action, atmosphere and story more than make up for them.  This is a game where you are rewarded for exploration but will often do a big ""NOPE"" at a particular junction and just refuse to enter certain corridors.  LL is like having a chain of Ravenholm's one after the other, each with their own particular flavour of ""oh shit, leg it"" to keep you on your toes.

That said the game's flaws do often get in the way.  The combat is solid but you rarely die and are rarely put under any real pressure.  The monsters are interesting but a little one dimensional, the monster boss fights are not engaging or scary.  Most of the time hearing and seeing the monsters is scarier than engaging them in combat.  Weapons have heft and weight and you feel like your bullets are connecting.  Fights against humans are more interesting and stealth plays a big part of the game, often the light is your enemy but sometimes it is your friend, although you being to wonder why the enemy can't see you standing in the half shadow when their lamp is shining right on you.

As some reviews mention the last third of the game goes a little wayward and the number of linear corridors increases.  This isn't a bad thing, it just becomes more noticeable.  The sheer variety of the environments and challenges keeps things ticking along.

The story is good if a little confusing now and then and it pivets a few times which can be annoying.  Most of the characters are well drawn and have both motivation and personality (although I found Anna to be a little too stereotypical).  By the end you feel like you have a connection to most of them, when I'm trying to protect the child by placing myself between him and Miller I know the game is doing something right.  

The game has been compared to Bioshock Infinite, however LL is an order of magnitude better.  LL's world feels alive, lived in, used and abused, Columbia was sterile and lifeless.  LL's story has a grounding and believability, Infinite's was just Ken Levine's mental masturbation.  LL's combat and survival mechanisms feel solid and real whereas Infinite's weapons were bland and spongy and why were plasmids in the game?  But enough of the rant, LL is a much better game.

Overall this is a truly amazing experience where you will be constantly checking behind you and looking to close doors to ensure you aren't followed, I rarely get that immersive feeling in a game.  It's also one of the few games where I wish it had been coop (or at least have the option), having a buddy to watch your back would have been great.

If you liked HL2's Ravenholm, Fallout 3 and RtCW then you'll likely enjoy this game.  Just try not to worry about Artyom being an indestructible superman.",1405784609,1405784801,True,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

I would occassionaly jump as monsters would surprise me, but the game is also quite creepy. There are some uncanny scenes that made me shiver. The gameplay has a lot going on for it. A lot of the HUD is disguised within the first person view. For instance there is no indicator telling you when to change gas mask filters, but the watch on your wrist keeps track. I felt that keeping up with gas mask filters and scavenging ammo made the game challenging because you really have to multitask sometimes. As I said before though, the story is incredible.

Many games have tried to offer something fresh to such a clichéd genre, and where some fail miserably, Metro succeeds.

 4A Games' previous effort, Metro 2033, felt kind of confusing as it forced you to perform certain tasks that proved nearly impossible (stealth which was heavily encouraged on higher difficulties was outrageous) due to the limitations of a slightly flawed and buggy engine. Still, the title showed promise thanks to its incredible atmosphere, outstanding graphics, original story and its several gameplay ""gimmicks"" that weren't exactly game changing, but still offered something fresh to an oversaturated trend. Has 4A managed to improve on this formula? Hell yes, and Metro: Last Light is one of the greatest single player shooters that I couldn’t recommend enough.

 The game puts you in the skin of Artyom, Metro 2033's protagonist, who after dealing with the ""problem"" of the first title, is told that it still hasn't been ""solved"" completely. While attempting to “solve” this problem once and for all, he is captured by the Nazis. Here is where everything starts to twist, in a series of plots and conspiracies between Reds and Nazis that ends in a predictable war for the control of the D6, occupied by the Rangers. To be honest, the story isn't exactly breathtaking and feels forced, but 4A is fully aware of it and compensates with some of the most believable environments, sound direction, characters and atmosphere that one can experience.

 Gun combat is extremely engaging and addictive with some very cleverly designed weapons that encourage you to try them all. Battles are a beauty to watch, as everything, even concrete blocks or wooden objects that seem unbreakable shatter into bits and pieces before your very eyes. This means that points of cover only last as much as they can stand firepower, so shootouts are extremely dynamic. The stealth system which was painful in 2033 has been improved and revamped. Soldiers no longer pinpoint your exact location when you miss a target with your throwing knife, but this comes at a cost, which is that the enemy AI is great at times and incredibly stupid at others. They will efficiently find good points of cover and work with each other to eliminate you, but they will get stuck behind them more than once which makes them easy to eliminate. The stealth system feels unnatural at times, since you can stand in front of somebody under the shadow and still not be detected.

 Now all that has been said up until now have been aspects of the game that don’t really stand out. It’s in the sheer amount of detail on every single aspect of the game where Metro: Last Light shines at its brightest. The cities, posts and settlements you encounter along the game are thriving with life; dialogues between people living in those communities are constant and there is always something to do, whether it’s paying a prostitute for a lap dance or winning a kid’s teddy bear on a shooting game so you can bring it back to him. Every single character you get to know has their own unique personality and traits that make most of them memorable. Another example is how great levels are designed, especially because they can be approached in more than one way (sometimes more than two) deciding to take the “pacifist” approach without killing any human enemy in the game (a la Deus Ex) or going guns blazing and shooting every moving target you can find. The game never tells you about decision making, but it’s there on every event, be it helping strangers, eliminating a whole squad that’s after you or taking care of surrendered foes. It’s great that every decision has its consequences, if it weren’t for the fact that there are only two different endings, instead of being able to see the consequences for yourself during gameplay (like in Dishonored). When it comes to non-human enemies, these are a bit more varied than in the last installment. Not only will you encounter the Nosalis as previously seen on 2033, but also different variations like the flying ones or the Rhino. Other completely new mutants such as the Spiderbugs or the Shrimp can be found in different environments and fighting them is quite fun as well (using the flashlight on Spiderbugs reminds me of Alan Wake).

  Overall, 4A manages to create a game with varied and perfectly paced gameplay. On one chapter you’ll be driving a railcar scavenging the metro while killing Spiderbugs. On another you’ll be escaping from the Nazis or the Reds only to go back up to the surface and encounter Demons and Shrimp alike while you wait for a moving platform to carry you away. Depending on the enemies you’re fighting against, you’ll have to adjust the way you approach them. If they’re human, you’ll want to be stealthy because hiding in the shadows is much easier. If they’re mutant however, either you try to avoid them or shoot them with whatever is more effective. This makes the game surprisingly fresh as there is never just one way beat a chapter; besides the game being linear and having to follow a straight path, you are allowed to make small decisions that although small, are abundant.

 The reason why Metro is such a beloved franchise is because of all the sheer amount of effort that is put into the titles. Even though it has its flaws both in-game and out (Ranger mode being part of DLC is one of the douchiest things that I have ever witnessed in gaming) they can and will be overlooked because of how epic, atmospheric, engaging, varied and huge the game feels.",1405381269,1405381269,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Every objective of every level is starting from point A and getting to point B in a pretty linear level.  Also, there's no inventory like say in STALKER or like a Resident Evil game.  Every item you just pick up and have.  In a lot of other games with this similar setting you have this kind of inventory thing and I feel that gives better game feel as an adventuer trying to scavage and survive a post-apocolyptic world.  So right away, it's pretty similar to Call of Duty singleplayer.

But in Call of Duty, at least exciting things are happening.  In this game there is a TON of not doing anything and walking slowly through towns that don't do anything for you.  Sure you can buy stuff, but you get captured right after so really that didn't matter at all.  You have to wait through nearly 15 mintues of UNSKIPABLE cutscenes at one point.   I wanted to like this game, I love games like Fallout and STALKER but this is just really boring.

There are stealth sections that are okay, but there are games who do it so much better because the entire game it structured around it.

Metro last light takes place after Metro 2033. For those who didn't play that; the setting is a futuristic Moscow. After the 3rd world war, everything's gone to hell. People live in metro tunnels and mutants roam the surface. Within the metros there's various factions. You've got the Reich (name says enough), some Communists and all sorts of whackiness. Either way, the setting's done incredibly well. You really get the feeling it tries to deliver; everything's gone to hell and people try to live best they can in their newfounded 'civilizations' while at the same time they wage war upon each other for idealogic differences.

The story itself isn't the best one. You're basically on a mission to find a specific creature. You end up following it all over the metro lines and after a while it feels like you're on a never ending fetch quest. While you do this you uncover a secret plot involving one of the factions who're up to no good, and this becomes another objective for you. While you go about your business you end up from one sticky situation in another, fighting your way out and trying to survive. Although the trying to survive bit sounds cool and all, I can't help but feel you're being hold by the hand like a babby. First few hours in it's one of your human companions. When you're finally on your own it's not very long untill you run into another conveniently placed helper. And another. And another. You're never allowed to feel like you're truly alone, trying to survive in the barren wastleland that is the surface. There's always that one helper making life ever so convenient. And that's a downside. Quite a big one at that, because the gameplay is pretty good, and the story forcing you to be around others feels like it's holding back the gameplay itself. 

Either way, as for the gameplay; you have quite a few different guns at your disposal, all very much costumizable and ready for you to fix up to how you need it. To do this, you find traders/shops and pay them with ammo, as ammo is used as a currency. Sadly, the ammo is a specific type and is not at all needed to be used in weapons, making the whole concept feel like a waste. It woulda been way cooler if I could pay with 9mm bullets, or 5.56 bullets. But nope, only the flammable ones! But, minor annoyance aside, the gunplay and everything's fine. Another gameplay related feature is the stealth mechanics. Often you're placed in a situation where you can either sneak past enemies or take them on guns blazing. Although I personally played this game on hardcore, I never felt like the game was overly challenging. Enemies could easily be disposed of with a silenced rifle and a single headshot, often not even alerting others that were right next to them. This made it too easy for me. If the AI had been better it might've been more challenging. So overall, guns are pretty good, ammo currency sytem feels a bit sloppy, and the stealth/difficulty isn't optimal.

Now, so far I might sound very negative about the game, but I'm really not. The game is a spectacle all around. The graphics are AMAZING and the setting is done incredibly well. A lot of attention has been put into the tiniest details, and you never feel like you're in an uninspired or boring place. And that's a very strong, redeeming quality. It's a blast to stalk through metro tunnels in the absolute dark, having nothing but a shotgun with a few shells and your night vision. The amazing sound effects contribute to the constant fear you're in as you try to hold on to your life while crouching behind dangerous mutants. Truly, when you're out on the actual missions and you're popping monsters and humans left and right, you forget all the flaws thsi game has, and I really liked that.


---Final Judgement---

Metro Last Light is an absolutely gorgeous game with great gunplay, amazing enviorments, an absolutely fantastic setting and some great moments. It doesn't go without flaws, and the story feels like it holds back the capacity of what it could've been massively, but if you're capable of putting that aside, you're in for an amazing experience.

But sure enough, your character blindly jumps in with reckless abandon and is teleported back in time to gather the alien/mutant. you then take the alien/mutant to your commanding officer, he made his hatred for these creatures very apparent at the beginning of the game. the alien disguises itself , then reveals itself specifically to this commander. his only response is ""what's that thing doing here"" to which you reply ""he's here to help us we have bigger problems"" and he just smiles and nods like he's on an incredibly strong opioid. suddenly having no interest in his mortal enemy, what so ever. after that your character reveals the Nazis have tanks, which was either never mentioned or so quickly mentioned i didn't hear, ever. they attack, implement learning curve more brutal than going having expert mode fire and flames as the first song on guitar hero for tank battle and rage quit. at the end of the day, the game has no plot, builds up a theme to destroy it in the end, becomes very suddenly hard at random intervals with no warning given, god awful ""visual effects"", if you can even call them that, more pointless moments and less consistency than a Shamalon film, and a literally unbeatable final boss, or what i assume to be a final boss, because my best guess is, they failed to even wrap the game up in any realistic way, so rather than force you to suffer through an incomplete conclusion, it just kills you. now and one or even few of these things might be overlooked, but it's this combination of things that renders any and all redeemable qualities for me useless. the game plays more like a bad drug trip than an interesting ""new take on apocalypses games"". this is honestly the Food Fight of the gaming world in my eyes. After the Mass Effect 3 fiasco with the ending and just pretty much the entire plot of the game, i thought i could never play another EA game again. This game made me forgive EA for it's atrocity. if i could give it a rating out of ten it'd be a negative twelve. Don't bother with it, truly awful game, undeserving of it's meta score in all ways. don't waste any money on this or it's remake.",1404839671,1404839671,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False
43160,11134665,76561198067468119,349,12,692,0,494,1421306015,"Metro: Last Light is an impeccably produced game, with an incredible sense of place and some breathtaking visuals and world design, especially in the above-ground sections of the game. It is, in every sense, Bioshock Infinite's equal, and it might even be the more visually arresting game of the two, depending on your preferences (I love my post-apocalyptic settings, so M:LL gets the nod over Infinite, if only just). I don't think I've enjoyed walking through underground tunnels as much as I have in M:LL, and the great level design and aesthetics plays a huge role here.

Gameplay-wise, M:LL is very much in the linear corridor shooter tradition, complete with the requisite NPC-accompanied sections where you have to wait for them to reach their destination(s) to trigger events and so on. Is it a huge deal? No, not really, but I did find them grating here and there. However, the game does somewhat make up for these sections by giving you a fair bit of agency when dealing with human enemies, letting you stealth it up or go in all guns blazing. The first half or so of the game is especially good in this regard, and the option of either ghosting by enemies, knocking them out or knifing them adds a bit of a moral dimension to the gameplay that ties in with certain plot themes.

Speaking of stealth, too often, I feel like FPS games with stealth tend to err a bit too much towards one play style: either the stealth is great and the shooting a bit less so, or vice versa. M:LL pulls off quite an impressive trick by making both playstyles really viable and enjoyable. I'm the type that likes to reload if I screw up a stealth bit, but in M:LL I found myself just rolling with the punches and breaking out the heavy artillery if I screwed up a stealth section.

Plot is where a lot of people really rate M:LL highly, and while I didn't get drawn into the plot and world as much as other people I've talked to, it's still a well-written, if a tad predictable, story with some impressive NPC writing (which does help make the NPC sections a lot more enjoyable) and a surprising amount of sensitivity in handling some very human issues such as life, death and suffering, as well as the human race's self-destructive tendencies. I never felt like the game was beating me over the head with these themes, which I have to commend; in lesser hands this could have become a gallery of pious hand-wringing and moralising about how we treat our fellow man, etc.

The linearity helps here, since I felt that a lot of the story and atmosphere is created by the carefully stage-managed way in which you move through stations and are shown various personal stories of survival and tragedy, as opposed to directly telling you how things are. And the small details such as small side rooms with supplies, and all the lootable corpses that litter the levels, add even more to the atmosphere of both the Metro system and bombed-out Moscow. 

It is, however, a bit easy on the normal difficulty setting. Everything does seem to be tilted a bit in your favour, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences. If you want to blast through a good post-apocalyptic corridor shooter, it won't be an issue, but if you're the type that wants to really ""feel"" it then Ranger Mode might be a bit more up your alley? And while I'm here, I have to say something about the boss fights: they're pretty poor. I like a good boss fight, but the fights in M:LL felt a bit too bullet sponge-y for me and were more tedioius than challenging.

All in all, Metro: Last Light is a great corridor shooter that's well worth your time. The world design and atmosphere is brilliant, the gunplay is immensely satisfying, and the stealth isn't too bad either. It does make some missteps here and there, and I personally don't find the plot as amazing as others, but it's still a fine game that's worth any FPS fan's time.",1404828635,1404829048,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,1,True,False,False

The concept was interesting, the storyline suggested it would be ripe territory for plot twists, etc...however what ruined this game for me was the ridiculous lag and horrible frame rates. It got so bad that I spent hours just trying to configure it to be playable. Even after all of the suggested settings (some of which conflicted), I gave up. In the combat areas where you literally have a dozen or so AI bots fighting you, it got so laggy that there was no way I could effectively do anything except load up on the shotgun and blast in the general direction of the bots. The AI was horrible...I could literally walk up to an enemy and he'd say ""what was that?""...when I was literally in their face. In some scenes, objects weren't mapped correctly, so when a character would pick up a cup to drink it would magically float about a half meter to his left. 

Overall, the look and feel of the game were good. The story was interesting.

Even though I haven't played the earlier Metro games (I've heard that 2033 is better than Last Light), I still think this is a pretty good game. The plotline is pretty straight forward and you really can't get lost if you remind yourself what your mission is. This game combines FPS gaming with stealthy tactics that provides some realism. Although, the crouching is a little OP in my opinion because you can crouch behind (or in some cases, crouch right in front of them) and silently kill/knock the enemy out without other enemies hearing a body drop to the floor. The game is still pretty alright. This game is like Walking Dead where decisions affect the ending as there are (SPOILER ALERT INCOMING!) two different endings to this game and based on your actions, you get a certain ending. Even though I have unlocked one ending of the game, I am still re-running the game to get that other ending that looks more promising than the one ending I got.

This is one of the best games I've played in a LONG time. I'm talking years. 
I'll start off with some negative points:
-Story line and characters are sometimes cliche
-Not enough exploration
-Awkward and unnecessarily bouncy boobs

Having said that, I give this game a 9.5/10. Here's why: 
-Beautiful graphics. Like Crysis level. The segments that take place on the surface are easily the best looking and the most fun parts of the game.
-Extremely immersive. Your watch in game actually shows the time, wiping blood off the visor of your gas mask, guns jamming, flashlight running out of batteries, etc.
-Satisfying stealth gameplay. Sneaking around in the dark while unscrewing lightbulbs and silencing ememies with a air pump powered gun makes you feel like complete badass. (or you can go in guns blazing and kill everything in sight if that's your style)
-The little exploration that is allowed is littered with pieces of the past that add so much to the sometimes lacking story. 
-Amazing sound design that creates a great atmosphere. Genuinley creepy at times due to the sound alone. 
-Overall great gameplay. Highly addicting. Guns have a real weight to them and feel powerful/weak when they are supposed to. 
-Outstanding enemy AI. Some of the best AI in any game I have played. 

I could go on, but I can't sit here and type all day. Overall this game is amazing and if you are into post apocalyptic or first person shooting games than this is a MUST HAVE for you.  This was a great improvement from Metro 2033, and in the future I hope the devs can improve on this by adding more mutants and more exploration. I've actually enjoyed this game soo much that I am considering buying the DLC missions.  0.0

 YOU or your character have a complete disability to preform any action to advance the plot... at every turn you are babysat or guided by a babysitter who haldles every decision, dialogue option, plot progresion and direction you can or need to take to further the game- you are little more than a useless and forgotten pawn in a plot that tries so hard to be complex and manages to bore you to death by 5-10 minute long monologues by npcs providing exposition while you just stand around waiting for them to stop talking so you can finally shoot something...

first person shooter...okay...here; dont shoot anybody!  sneak around and assasinate people or throw knives, which are more effective than an automatic shotgun at close range...
first person shooter...but dont expect to shoot anybody or make decisions or be involved in the story or plot as the main character... instead npcs or cutscenes will rip the controls from your hands so the computer can handle any scenes of action or cut to an npc to solve the problem...
half the game you're bombarded with boring uninteresting cutscenes which drag on endlessly..the second half puts you in isolated linear instances, removes the combat capability forcing you to sneak by undetected effectively removing any element of a first person shooter...
good scares in the first hour, I'll give it that but it's all just more and more and more of 1st act scares...why does this guy keep walking through the front door of the pit of hell, before every area you enter there is a clear and obvious path just beyond the cell either through a empty building or a simple grass covered area you could just as easily traverse and avoid the hell you are about to walk into...

and mission objectives...WTF... turn on the lights, cross the bridge, move through a building...of course we wont simply put these 5 simple words or less on your hud to tell you where to go, nonono  hold down a series of 3 keys at different intervals to hold up a clipboard which has the 3 words you need to understand what you have to do.  
or even better follow this person through an area- who instantly teleports invisibly to the final area of the massive cell leaving you to wander around aimlessly until you may or may not accidently stumble on something which may indicate a general direction to go.
there ar eso many occasions where you are shown an overhead view of the area you have to move through are told you have to find specific things within the area and they give no details as to the general area where these things are or what they are... 
CROSS THE BRIDGE...
your in a swamp where every third step sends you throttling helplessly underwater, and when you en=merge are totally disoriented as you can't see three feet infront of you...CROSS THE BRIDGE, just CROSS THE BRIDGE...  what bridge? you mean find this tiny knee high post with a button on it and press it 3 times to summon a raft...? really THAT'S THE BRIDGE?!

mission objective; listen to me talk for 10 minutes or more about something and now go to this location we wont show you or give any details as to where it is... go here..where is here? I mean here we are on a giant hill overlooking the area can you atleast point me in a direction of where to go? describe a landmark? ominous lights on the horizon or a broken tower or church steeple? ...no just GO HERE...

When you start this game you are (EVERY TIME) met with a unskippable logos of the developer, the name of the writer for the book. 
NOT IDEAL
You get into a game. Start is very cool. You kill your comrades because of some freakish thing where you see them as monsters. 
You are a member of ""rangers"", neat. You are in a medical room. You go to armory to choose your guns. 
Graphics are amazing. 
But at this point the game breaks apart. Story is ""cool"", but not something I care too much for. You are met with linearity. What I mean is there are characters talking and you cannot walk around them. You can jump around like an idiot. 
When you finally get to a part when the game actually starts. With a VERY bad impression so far you are met with a DOOR. And there is a lever next to them. What is logical to do ? Use it ? NO!
You need to wait for your partner to come there and then you can use. 
You venture outside. Partner goes god knows where. 
This part is awesome. You shoot monsters. And chase one down. Problem is, even when you shoot it, it lives because of the PLOT. You catch it. Than CUTSCENE happens. And you are in prison.
Your new friend Pavel helps you out.
Again, completely linear with not way of doing it your own way. 
You escape. Expecting you will escape. 
But your friend (because he is an idiot) gets captured by nazis. Because your are a nice person you MUST save him. 
You are met with again linear path. Door are oftenly locked. Stealth is a option. No wait... Stealth is required because as soon as you run out of ammo you are fucked. AI is good. 
I was met with a VENT. NICE I can stealth around here. Fuck yeah. Oh wait. That vent just ends and is completely useless to you. 

As I said. If I wanted a super movie linear like experience I would play Call of Duty. And to be frank. Call of Duty has at least Multiplayer to keep you busy for few hours. This has very linear campagin with little to no way of doing things your own way.

Well, the game plays nicely this review is based on a normal walkthrough, and it teaches you on the go. The story itself is quite fun and in my opinion the time I spend playing (which i consider avarage) really works. Would it be longer it would be dragging if it was shorter it would have felt flat. 

The story has his unusual twists and things that seem out of place in a post-apocalyptic shooter but it’s executed nicely. I won’t go too far into detail to avoid spoilers. Character building is decent, in my opinion not the best I’ve witnessed but also not the worst.

One thing that nagged me though is the optimization of the game (or me just demanding too much) the AF (Advanced physx if i'm not mistaken) kills frame rate in some scenes even on a GTX 780 where it drops back from 70+ to 30. This is very noticeable on screen. Another thing that was kind of strange was the choice of voice acting for take downs. The people that you took down spoke in plain English and often the same voice some variation would have been nice, while the rest of the cast has the typical bond villain/ Russian speaking English accent.

At certain levels the graphics encountered spasms and would cause wrongly rendered (flickering) clouds. A restart of the game fixed it though.

Next up, there are some parts which gave me the creeps, with nicely executed ‘ghosts’ in the corner of your FOV and when looking  straight at them they wouldn’t be there. Sudden scares are there too which unlike movie scares are quite fun. 

Stealth is also an option and in some cases needed ammo while available in a great enough quantity, can sometimes run out, forcing you to search for other methods. The looting system was a bit of a deal breaker though. You’ll find lots of ammo of the weapons which are best in a following part or in the part you’re in. So while convenient this kind of spoiled/helped in picking your weapons.

As said pacing is good. There are however some ‘waiting’ scenes. These didn’t bother me because I can be a bit patient. But that’s what you get for minimal cutscenes. ( I counted 2 or 3)

Graphics are in my opinion brilliant, the meshes are nicely done and the textures mix well with the theme. Lighting was superb  sometimes blinding but it fit in. 

All in all a decent game,

If you are struggling to make the game work on a good GPU (GTX 680 or better) make sure you update your PhysX drivers. For some reason NVidia GeForce/Control panel don’t update these automatically. After updating the PhysX driver my FPS on max settings (without AA) went from 15fps to 90-115fps. Alternatively, if you’re using an AMD card or a less powerful NVidia card you can disable PhysX in the gameplay options. Although a pain in the arse, getting the game to work was well worth it. This game has outstanding graphics, including the best lighting I’ve ever seen in a game. Its gameplay gives a real sense of immersion; whether manually charging your flashlight, wiping the shit off your gasmask or crawling though the spider infested vents of the metro. Played with a decent set of headphones, you will be constantly checking your back when you hear faint footsteps right behind you. The gameplay is rather linear at times which defiantly takes away some of the immersion. When you are in the semi-open world sections of the campaign the game excels. I’d defiantly give the game a play though and if you do play it in Russian with English subtitles since the English voice acting is abysmal.

Now the debate on video games as art has two very distinct sides. I understand both, consider how many titles are nothing more than rail shooters or objective runs, it would be easy to dismiss television or the internet based on the jersey shore or twitter but then you see breaking bad or wikipedia, things that almost instantly redeem theses mediums and convey awe, inspiration and emotion. Metro does this for video games.

Metro comes from a russian development studio which makes it unique, the story is outlined by a book which only helps build the game. You start as generic good guy, but theres a twist. Where most games your dropped into whatever passes as a level and then things take a turn for the worse metro begins at the worst. It's a dystopian universe that just seeps in from everywhere. Death is simply an accepted reality, fear is something that just has to be dealt with.  

The world is set in a post apocalyptic russia, the only habitable area is the metro the moscow subway lines.  After the apocalypse the different stations seperated into different factions, each with a dominant philosophical principle. Over time resources dwindled and wars erupted. In the metro humanity loses all pretense of eing inherently good, you along with everyone else is a survivor and nothing more. 

Your interactions are always talking about the scarcity of weapons, food,  medicine. The presence of death, loss and fear permeate everything. You feel the uncertainty aout humanities fate,  and you watch as people do what they must or what they can get away with.  You see brutal acts such as rape, murder, genocide. And this is contrasted with love, benevolence and preservation.  In the metro both the best and worst of humanity exist, and while there is a morality system I suspect that the consequences of your choices are largely irrelevant, but thats realistic, you know what you did when noone was looking, you know who you are.  

You end up feeling the importance and precious value that all human life has in the metro. There are more dead bodies that you come across than live ones.  The resources you extract predominantly come from these corpses so every life you take is one less person for the future.  I normally shoot first and ask questions later but I more frequently knocked people out when I had the option than kill them.  

IF your looking for an immersive experience youll find it in metro. It is an adult game and takes place in an adult world. Strippers and sex add to the game and the environment, they arent sole plot points. There is clear brutality by the nazi's, reds and even the spartans and you experience it all.

1. Throwing knives WAY OP. 1 shot kill for everything
2. AI's were... weird. would stick to cover, making them hard to kill, but then seemed deaf sometimes.
3. Story line: Good until the metro river part. was probably good in the book (which i haven't read) but too cerebral 2/3 through the story. seemed like a cop out.
4. Playing on Ranger/hardcore mode: fun, but familiarize yourself with the controls first. also, for some reason, you never need to charge your flashlight?
5. Weapons (exclusively guns) were pretty repetitive until the last 3/4th of the game. often times newer guns would just be straight upgrades. seems silly that the post-nuclear society found a TON of these amazing weapons. also, attachments were way to cheap. lastly, too many guns lying around with tons of upgrades. seems unrealistic.

Mechanically speaking, a lot of the stealth gameplay and action is still present, offering a dual approach in many situations. Per my own personal preference, I was able to(in many cases, not all), sneak past or neutralize guards and mutants alike. Throwing knives will become the weapon of choice for those who have no qualms about killing any obstacles in there way. And likewise, if you prefer to step out, machince gun in hand to put men and mutant alike to the sword, go right ahead! Graphically speaking Last Light looks excellent. If you have the PC to handle it. I have a dedicated gaming rig that can more than handle the demands of lighting and physx, but even after all that I still needed to troubleshoot fps issues. I found those instructions on the community for the game. In terms of narrative, you will develop a relationship with the Metro and the people who inhabit it through Artyom. Even if you didn't play the last game, you will glean past and current events just by listening to the banter between guards and bits of conversation within the varied towns within the Moscow Metro. The story line and morality system make this game a great pick if you're looking for a first person shooter with a strong stealth element. Just make sure you pace yourself through the game if you want to catch everything there is to offer. 
As for the DLC, they are cool, but not necessary. Acting like individual episodes that occur around the events of Metro Last Light through Artyom, the DLCs will put you in multiple roles as other characters. Some of these characters are only expanded as far as to explain the scenario, while others are characters from the campaign, like Ulhman, Khan, Pavel or Anna. Like I said, these episodes are cool, but not necessary for extended gameplay. One of the DLC was purely a weapon exposition that lasted less than 15 minutes. Take that as you will.

Graphics:

Metro LL is nice, it has better polished (for me maybe too much) graphic than 2033, runs well on even older machines. Textures, models, characters and their animations, everything nicely fits in its place and story.

Story:

Same world, same setting, nicely continues after 2033 (would be nicer if could take in count your previous good/bad story ending in 2033, but i understand it would be really hard to include this). But i think it is enjoyable even without previous knowing of world of Metro 2033. A few and not so unexpectable story twists. Nice atmosphere overall in believable world. Same as in 2033 one can dig really deep into LL just by listening dialogues of NPCs (even enemies).

Level design:

Strong and for me much more corridor feeling than in 2033, but still very nice level design. A lot of prescripted events, but it fits nice in gameplay (i love stealth so i enjoyed mostly no killing if possible).

Gameplay:

Same mechanism like in 2033 - you can go in Rambo style and run into every fight or just sneak through dark corners watching enemies and waiting for right moment to sneak further - simple and working stealth mechanics are here and very useable.

Rest:

- only few quicktime event, but still has movie feeling
- sometimes events are so fast (or escalated so fast) so player can't enjoy fully environment
- more corridor feeling than 2033, but some areas like swamp are nice and easy to lost in them ;)
- crashed only 2 times during whole gameplay (both crashes were with no reason during ""calm"" parts of the game in populated stations
- otherwise stable overall, no glitches or bugs found
- reasonably fast loading times
- you can find some fine culture in game - Bolshoi theater show on one of stations, peepshow, poledancing and private lapdancing on other stations :)
- really living and strongly believable world (anyway i like 2033 much more, it has somehow stronger atmosphere than Lastlight for me)

And, finally! :D

- no Librarians, i really hated them in 2033 ;)) (sice i have some another Moscow library mission with my DLCs i just decided to not to play it ;), i don't want to see any Librarian any more, 2033 was enough ;))

Absolutely fell in love with this world, now i play Stalker :)",1404481047,1404481047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, i purchased this game just after it's announcement for a linux port. Hoping to play it on my slackware desktop... sadly i could not. As the linux port is not very good at all. The graphics options in the linux port are restricted to a single slider that ranges from ""low"" to ""high"". Aswell as that, the game kept crashing at random points... and weird things happening all over the place. Tried on an ubuntu desktop also, but same effects with the crashes.

In the end i played through the game on a windows 7 machine, and i enjoyed the story, and also the extra missions have several hours of fun.

I'm annoyed that the developers have ""moved on"" to a redux of a game that is not even a year old already. I will not be buying the redux -- as i'm not forking out £15 for a patch-level update. If the developer fails to fix the current release in terms of the state of the linux port... then they are releasing beta software (or arguably, pre-alpha) games as retail/release titles... that is unacceptable.

Such a nice gameplay, KI, graphics, story and more...
I won't spoiler anything, I'll just tell you, that the story of the game begins normal and ends with one of the greatest endings I've ever seen.
The gameplay is more realistic than the most ""realistic"" games. there are some useless features, which making the game a bit harder but more realistic. But I didn't play on Hardcore mode so I can't tell you how much more realistic it is.
Not many but nice weapons with some features which are nice to handle with.
The KI is the best I've ever seen in all games I've played. They're not doing just things like standing around or going from left to right. They're more intelligent you could think they've got an own thinking and moods. (Just play it to understand i won't spoiler)
Yes, I found some (2) bugs but they haven't been a problem and they didn't changed the gameplay. By the way, no game is perfect, every game has it own bugs.
You could also think about decisions like: Kill, knock him out, help or let him alive. (There are some archievements for this)
I think these decisions won't change the story but I'm not sure about this.

There are more and even more features in this game but I'll end now, make your own decision by buying the game.

43160,11053462,76561198029290652,260,2,2862,0,2071,1567906212,"Before the Steam Summer Sale, I'd only seen the old live action trailer (you know the one), and heard vaguely good things about it. When thr Complete version went on as a Daily Deal or Flash Sale (I don't remember which), I picked it and a few other things up.

Now, after the sale, I'm wishing I'd played it during instead; because I would've bought the first one too--and then proceeded to preorder the re-release coming soon. 

This is a fantastic game, with well-written, fully-developed characters and an excellent approach to storytelling and player interaction. In short, player choices (and the effect they have on the story) are not obvious, branching plot changes; but rather small, subtle changes in actions or dialogue that can easily be missed, but if considered, change the player's interpretation of the situation. As an example, in one area where enemies attempt to ambush the player, it is possible to sneak by undetected; doing so, you can hear the enemies talking to each other ABOUT the player, revealing that they are terrified of the player, and just doing what their superiors have ordered. Similarly, when stealth-meleeing enemies, you have the option to knock them out or kill them. I've done both numerous times, and I still can't see any difference gameplay-wise; [i]however[/i], it [i]does[/i] change the player's impression of Artyom. Is he a blood-thirsty psychopath? A pseudo-pacifist? Or just a normal person in extraordinary circumstances? It's all very interesting to contemplate, and the great thing about it is that you only need go as deep with that as you want. You can play the game through, taking everything at face value, and then play it again differently, thinking through and carefully analyzing everything you do; and you will get a different interpretation of the story.

On a non-story note, the gameplay is excellent (minus occasional bugs, but these can usually be ignored--or, if disruptive/persistant enough, restarting the game), with extraordinary attention to detail. Good stealth is a must for this game, and thankfully 4A seems to have managed. The watch LED on Artyom's wrist is visible and clear enough that stealth works well (LED is on=you're visible, LED is off=not visible), and shadows are plentiful enough for needed sneaking around. I did kind of feel that the hearing on enemies was a bit weird; what with accidentally missing a target's head and hitting the wall 50+ feet behind them making all local mobs alert, while hitting them would not (even if they were only about 10-15 feet from an ally), but otherwise it was fine.

Managing resources/needs is well-done, with the battery charge, mask filters, and pneumatic weapon pressure all being significant and requiring attention without being all-consuming. Helpful reminders of these are provided visually (flashlight gets dimmer, watch displays a countdown on the current filter, pneumatic weapons have a gauge), and audibly in the case of filters (Artyom starts wheezing at about ~1:30 left, and the watch will flash and beep once it reaches 60 seconds). Most importantly, replenishing these is not an arduous task, with both the battery charging and the filter being replaced each taking a few seconds (pneumatic weapons take longer, but are generally not something to bother with until you intend to use them, as they require an upgrade in order to not leak air when overpressurized--without which,they not only leak air, but leak [i]noisily[/i], which enemies can hear). If I were to make a complaint on this topic, it would be that the cosmetic damage to the gas mask becomes apparent quite a while before the game determines it is damaged enough to replace; once I first became aware that the mask could be broken, I became rather paranoid about switching masks frequently--and there seems to be a minimum damage threshold to permit mask swaps. This is a minor quibble, however; and only included for completeness.
 
Combat-wise, Metro LL is very good; but there's not much unique here for me to ramble on about (except that the blood-splatter/mud-splashes, when on the mask, can be quickly wiped away to clear vision; and [i]that[/i] was a nice touch). Gunplay is good, weapons feel solid, throwing knives are especially well done; I do wish there was an option to try out attachments to guns obtained later in the game without purchasing them, but it makes perfect sense in-game, and can simply be internalized as both you and Artyom being on unfamilar with the weapon and therefore, forced to decide whether or not you want it from the character's perspective. I suppose my favorite aspect of this is the game's emphasis on careful stealth. Not that common in FPSes these days.

My only [i]real[/i] annoyances with this game are more on the technical side. It only allows one save file, meaning that if you play through the game again, you're erasing your previous save (so, if you are considering trying to beat the game on Ranger Hardcore, realize that you'll have to play through the game [i]again[/i] when you're done if you want to play any of the chapters over again on an easier difficulty (you can re-play any chapter you want, but it will have have the settings, pickups, and equipment of the last time you started a new game and reached that chapter). Also, it has a disappointing amount of customizations, and the inability to run as Borderless Fullscreen, or even just normal Windowed mode, makes doing anything else at the same time (for those with multi-monitor systems) rather tricky.

Nuclear war has ravaged the modern war in the near future, and in Moscow, Russia, most have taken to the underground labyrinth that is the metro tunnels (read: subway). Much like Fallout, you are forced to deal with radiation and scarce ammunition (so scarce in fact, that military-grade ammunition doubles as the sole currency in Metro, although it can still be used in your gun for a substantial damage boost over standard ammo) and creatures that are terrifyingly twisted abominations due to radiation. Due to the scarcity of ammo and having to replace the filters on your gas mask every 5 minutes or so (only when in irradiated areas or above ground, please don't misconstrue this as a requirement throughout the entire game, changing filters every 5 minutes) and keeping your battery charged for your flashlight, Metro keeps you on your toes and forces you to think carefully about your next couple of moves. Entering a room full of enemies with guns blazing often suicide, and this just adds to the tense feeling of the game.

There are a variety of weapons and attachments, although my favorite is the suppressed pistol for silent kills, and of course your knife for the same. As has been made famous through television's The Walking Dead and other games in this genre ""Why waste a bullet"" really strikes true here. As for the story, the Metro has various factions that live in different parts of the Metro, all with there own ideals, ""turfs"" if you will, and you begin as Artyom, a Ranger of The Order, set out to defend D6 (a sprawling underground military bunker, and the Rangers' home) against the Dark Ones (creatures with telepathic abilities) and the various other factions (the Fourth Reich, the Red Line, Polis, and the Commonwealth of the Stations of the Ring Line) out to take D6 for their own. There is everything a great book, and a great game should have such as suspense, intrigue, lust, friendship, betrayal, trimuph and tragedy. 

The game itself is also very, very beautiful, and with Nvidia's advanced Physix turned on in graphic options, extremely taxing on your graphics card, so much so that Metro is still the gold standard for many that benchmark GPU's. I have a Geforce GTX 760 and, all other hardware aside, cannot get more than a few FPS with Physix turned on and all other options set to ultra. Don't get me wrong, the game still looks amazing with Physix off, one of the best in my collection, but if your GPU can handle it, it adds an incredible amount of atmospheric immersion.

There have been few games I have played that really drive home how hopeless and unforgiving the surrounding world can seem at times, and it was an emotional rollercoaster from beginning to end. I haven't had this kind of reaction to a game's storyline and plot since, well, up until now only books have been able to whisk me away like Metro has. If all of these things sound like your cuppa tea, then pick up Metro, put on your best headphones, find some a few hours of undisturbed time and dive in, you won't regret it.

As a side note, I had read many reviews talking about how difficult the game was, and my first time playing, I made the mistake of choosing the easiest difficulty as I am a father of three and don't have much free time that I can play games like this without being disturbed, and as with games like this, I usually die A LOT if I have distractions every few minutes. Don't do it. Play on medium/regular difficulty and enjoy the challenge. I did end up switching sometime shortly after the first few missions and it was completely worth it. Games like this are not ones that are meant to be played with full ammo for every weapon at all times, full health and many extra filters for your gas mask.",1404394879,1404394879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics: 10
 First I just would like to say what a great job 4A does at creating a fantastic atmostphere in their games. 2033 had a great atmosphere and Last Light follows suit. It's a creepy, dampening world and I had a lot of fun just exploring it. The character detail is fantastic and the world itself is mesmerizing to look at and admire all of the little things 4A has put into Last Light. Wind and rain also show up in gorgeous fashion and the lighting in Last Light is some of the best I've seen to date.

Story: 8
The story isn't going to change much. It's kind of typical stuff veteran gamers have been through before.That being said, I did enjoy it. You will go from one extreme to the next on your missions as a ranger for ""The Order""(One of the games many factions.) Who is friend and who is foe? You never really know in this world riddled by nuclear war. Everyone has their own agenda; all trying to steer you in their direction. 4A does a great job at making the player play through the entire game in first person perspective, something I wish other companies would do, making everything more believable. You really get to buy into some characters while others you may come to despise. I think this helps with immersion greatly. 

Gameplay: 9
Last Light's gameplay can range from shoot everything that moves, to sneaking in the shadows. You can play many sections of the game in different ways. Do you want to sneak and silently assassinate every enemy in the area, or maybe run in guns a blazin and see how many lead silhouttes you can paint? The choice is yours and Last Light does both well. The arsenal in which you are equipped is pretty typical. You have your shotguns, assault rifles, grenades, and sniper rifles. However, I found myself enjoying the non-traditional weapons more. The ""bigun"" is a gun that fires arrows and I found it particularly effective when I wanted to play sneaky. There are a few more to discover and each are unique in their own way. Weapon cusomization isnt as deep as I feel like they could've gone, but its enough since im sure resources in this world are few and far between. The surface sections of Last Light were particularly nerve racking for me. Its easier to predict enemies in the metro but in the open world your enemy can attack from any direction and en masse. There will be many more creatures to fend off on the surface as well. Monsters that can fly, swim, and charge you with reckless abandon. Also, Last Light felt a little more ""over the top"" with its action scenes a-la Call of Duty. Which, by no means, is A bad thing. I felt like it worked very well in this world.

Closing thoughts:
I was shocked by how much fun I had with Last Light and the amount of detail that went into creating this world. Try it out if you can get it on sale. Theres a lot of detail here and the gunplay is great fun as well. 
Make sure your rig can handle it and you should be fine.

Both stealth and gunplay was tight, even if the stealth was easier than it should have been. Unfortunately you don't spend much time in combat but instead you walk around listening to people talk. It's even worse if you master stealth and end up speeding through the combat segments, straight into the next 20 minute episode of ""let's talk while walking very slowly."" Often I would fire a couple shots in the air to let them know I was coming just because stealth is so quick and unfair, and I wasn't anxious to do the next walk-and-talk.

Graphics are awesome
Runs well. Mouse input is perfect
Gunplay is tight
Killing dudes is fun.

Stealth was an all too easy solution to everything
Killing monsters is less fun.
Not killing anything isn't fun at all.

The stealth mechanics seem to work pretty well, the enemies don't seem to always and immediately know exactly where you are once they are alerted, however the ai seems to be pretty strait forward when they know where you are, I don't find they try to flank etc.

The game is beautiful, and not just graphically, as there is very obviously a lot of effort into the stage design, the action oriented stealth and gun segments as well as the lulls in which you walk about the various stations to get a look into the setting, where you are shown the livelyhoods of the metro dwellers attempting to live lives as best they can in the aftermath of the world being gutted of its color by nuclear holocaust. 

The stealth mechanics are much more forgiving than 2033's were, to the point some would argue is excessive since the people you're sneaking up on are basically rendered incapable of seeing more than a foot in front of them (four if they're standing next to a lamp). But compared to the last game, where stealth was more or less impossible without repeated attempts and memorization, I found it much more fun to play through.

With that said, why the thumbs down? Basically, despite it being a fun, well made game, I'm not comfortable recommending it. The eyeroll worthy treatment of women in the game, culminating in the (mercifully short, at least) forced first person perspective sex scene where Anna waxes philosophic about humanity's future, and then pulls her tity out, made me roll my eyes out of my head and squirm in my seat with embarrassment. 

It's not like these moments (there are a few, by the way, the moment in the brothel, the bandits sexually menacing a woman they had captured, etc) took away the fun I had playing up to that point, but it certainly marred what I was fully prepared to call a top notch gaming experience. 

So in short, Metro: Last Light is a good game, just one I'm not enthusiastic about getting others to play. I hope any further entries in the series forgo these offputting elements, as without them, the game is very enjoyable.",1404276113,1404276264,False,3,0,0.524744272232055664,0,True,False,False

The original game was (and still is) an example of a game that while not excelling in anything, performed overall as a package rather well. Metro: Last Light has managed to take all the elements that made Metro: 2033 as good a game as it was and improved on seemingly every one. The atmosphere in a game like this can make or break the experience, and this may be the first game that I could honestly say has a stronger, more haunting setting than Stalker: Call of Pripyat. The change from the grey nuclear winter of the first to the nuclear spring, mixing plant life into the ruins of Moscow creates a setting that can range from an eerie ambiance to utterly terrifying depending on which of the superb lighting and weather effects are used. The gunplay is also very improved, and every gun I used felt wonderful to shoot, and felt energetic, even with a suppressor.  The story is of equal quality to the first, if not better, and expands the spiritual and supernatural aspects of the universe in a way that manages to not feel forced or just silly. 
My only criticisms of the game are that far to much of the players time is spent on the surface, lacking many of the large set piece battles present in the first game, such as the “Frontlines” mission. I personally prefer human enemies to mutants, but this can be forgiven in light of the wonderful atmosphere (no pun intended) on the surface. The second is that the requirements to get the “Good” ending of the game are far too arbitrary and specific, forcing the player to practically make a checklist to avoid the very specific tasks required, rather than having the player make moral choices naturally throughout the story. On my first playthrough, I made all the “Good” choices on the moral flow chart, but due to the checklist nature of the game, did not get the good ending.  Further, the difference between the good and bad ending does not seem to have much direct relation to the actions of the player thought the game, which further cheapens the actual moral choices made throughout the game. However, this does not make this game a less stellar piece of work, and a first class survival-horror game.

You either fight all humans and a handful of monsters or all monsters and only a handful of humans. Each have their difficulties which can make fighting either one of them over and and over with no variation a little irritating. 

I have about 15 hours on record without playing any DLC and I am almost positive that I didn't explore every inch of the game as I usually would. I could see somone getting 30 hours out of this game if they explore everything and complete the DLC. I am not usually a big fan of FPS but this game has a great story and really interesting characters with a environment that completely immerses you in the game. 

Things I liked: The variety in your arsonnel is great. You can buy guns from vendors or you can pick them up off your enemies after you've killed them. Ammo is the same way. You can pick up just about all that you need but it doesnt hurt to stock up if you have the funds. I also liked how frequently the game auto saved. Probably the most irritating thing about playing games and dying a lot is that you find yourself way back in the game and you have to work your way back to where you died. Metro saves you that headache and saves after every major battle and randomly throughout the game but always at the best part. 

Things that sucked: I played the game on normal difficulty and still found myself struggling with some of the monsters in the game. I thought that it took way too much ammo to kill them and that there were some parts that demonstrated hard difficulty. For the life of me I could not figure out how to switch between the throwing knives and the bombs. I was using a controller and there were no functions that allowed me to switch. BTW REMEBER TO TURN THE PHYSX OR WHATEVER OFF BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL DROP FRAMES LIKE CRAZY!

It was an enjoyable thrill ride of adrenaline and I believe it did what it set out to do. The sequel, Last Light, really did a good job following up. At the same time, I don't feel like you HAVE to have played the first to understand the second. They sort of walk you through the major plot points for anyone not familiar.

Pros: The story is still rich and immersive. The way you score ""good points"" makes sense and it's fun to get achievements for things like sitting through a whole show. If you don't mind standing around, you can be rewarded with some even more world building stories; ones that give a glimpse into an NPC's life. 

One of the things that impressed me with 2033 was the graphics, even on low, which is what my old laptop had to be set to, the graphics were beautiful. Last Light also has stunning graphics and if I may say, I think the visuals are even better. Especially the more lush environments.

I love the new system for picking up ammo. It's much more convenient to only have to press the button once to gain all of the supplies you can use off a dead body; especially if you happen to be running for your life.

I played the game on normal because I'm not a manly man go getter who thinks hard is easy. I will say that due to this though, I had an abundance of ammo, filters, medkits, pretty much everything. I never felt panicked for supplies. Those who want a challenge, I definitely recommend Hard, if you think you can handle the tougher AI. Even on normal, those things suck up bullets like it's going out of style.

Cons: One in particular that I view as a major glaring problem, is the lack of understandable instructions. Often times I found myself lost, because my objectives were waaaaay too vague. I went through two missions where my objective board only told me ""get to some place"", but I was held up because I apparently needed to do something else first as a means of getting there. 

The same goes for closer to the end, when the NPC's shout what you're supposed to do, but they give no indication of how or where. This leaves you to fumble around and probably die a few times before piecing it together.

It's like this game is allergic to providing hints. Nothing is more frustrating, at least for me, than dying repeatedly because I have absolutely no clue what I'm supposed to do.

All in all though, I definitely recommend this game if you have plenty of patience, or at least a very strong will to persevere and conquer that which angers you.

I hope any potential buyers find this helpful.



(*SPOILER***!! This is no more obvious than when you get stuck in ""arena"" type battles with monsters. You check your objective board? Nothing helpful. No info on what you're supposed to do. And each ""mini"" boss is handled in a different way, so it's not like you can just repeat previous actions. Especially if you're trying to go for the ""good ending"" and not kill everything, then it's hard to tell whether you're supposed to kill the creature or not. 

Most of the con is aimed at the arena miniboss battles, and the final tank section. Because how the hell am I supposed to automatically know to keep shooting the wheels, even after I already broke the mechanism that turns them? And why does that stop me from killing the guy firing rockets at me?! I'm very angry right now.)",1404250441,1404250441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Leading on from Metro2033 this game is set in a post-apocalyptic underground railway system in Russia, where the character must struggle against the survivors of a Nuclear war and the creatures that the war bred. The metro is largely abandoned by humans and is instead possessed by the supernatural and mutated forms of animals along with strange and unexplainable entities. The few humans that did survive the Nuclear fallout and have learned to adapt to the metro way of life have done so at the expense of their humanity. The main factions faced are the communist 'Reds' who dominate the metro by killing anyone in their way, and the facist 'Nazis' who worship the nazi doctrine and have thier own concentration camps for those with less than desirable features or beliefs. The men found in and out of these factions are brutal and merciless, rape, murder and torture is largely practised in the game, often in front of you or with your optional participation. I often had to pause the game at regular intervals to close the doors around me and turn on the lights nearby, the horrific storyline combined with the graphics and complexity of the creatures and people faced was too much.  If the remains of life are not enough to scare you the texture and plot will. Superb animation and detail  with a highly immerisve story and character development make this game a pure masterpeice. 
Some points of this game may look like a typical 1st Person shooter but it is most definitely not, this has got to be one of scariest but most interesting games i have ever played. Very little 'spray and pray' combat and a heavy focus on stealth and silent takedowns, although going loud is always an option. Additonally each in each peice of comabt you face a diffrent kind of enemy with diffrent strategies. One minute its human bandits the next its waves of giant scorpion like things. Each confrontation happened for a reason. This element in particular left me impressed as most shooting games get fairly repeditive and boring after a fashion but this most certaintly did not.  Another great feature was also the option to choose your own actions, you can execute or spare people, rob them or donate to them. Alway free will which i love.  
In summary BUY BUY BUY BUY if you are into horror, action or just generally have good taste.

- Atmosphere. This game completely blows many games out of the water. The attention to detail in the environments it just breathtaking. Every corner hand-crafted, cities feel alive. You can feel the despair and fear. There are some really tense moments in this game and you really feel like you are there. There is one part of the game about 1/3 of the way through that really breaks the tension away when you hit Venice, but it's only a minor complaint. Once I started playing this game, I couldn't stop. Lastly the graphical fidelity in this game is breathtaking. Some of the best visuals I've seen all year.

- Gameplay. All the guns feel nice and responsive and the creature design is creepy. Enemy humans try to flank you and appear to work as a team. They communicate with one another and feel much better then most ""AI"" found in games. There is a large focus on stealth, and alot of the time it is much better to stealth then go guns blazing. In order to get the ""good"" ending in the game you actually have to spare as many lives as possible. My only problem with the gameplay is the stealth is overpowered.  You can stand right next to someone if you are in the shadows and cannot be seen. 

- Story. In fantastic, based off of a book and is set in a post-apocolyptic future in Russia. Where various factions live and how they deal with the destruction of the ""dark ones"". I won't go into details but I found myself reall engrossed with this story. There is a small love interest, which just seems shoe-horned in just to have it and really lacks depth.

I'll just start that I played through the game on Ranger Mode, and I highly recommend you do too. The added pressure of not having a HUD and the extra scarcity of ammo really drives home the feeling of desparation in this game, and makes the experience much more immersive. 

The graphics, as you probably have heard, are top-notch, and while a game should never be judged by them, I think its worth mentioning that this game is absolutely gorgeous at max settings and really lends itself to the overall gloomy atmosphere of the refuge from the end of the world that is the Metro.

The first few hours of the game aren't too far from CoD and Battlefield; very linear and a forced stealth section, but after that the game truly opens its arms. Making your way through the Metro's tunnels and finding what evils lie within and dealing with them as you see fit is a great experience. 

Almost all encounters in the Metro tunnels can be stealthed, and the game has some fairly decent stealth mechanics. While its no Metal Gear Solid, staying in the shadows and leaping at unsuspecting enemies is plenty of fun. Save for the first few instances, all fights can also be played loud. Human encounters are linear however, but with the absence of an AI companion and HUD markers holding your hand to the next set piece, combat feels a bit more open despite the claustrophobic nature of the Metro. 

While weapons can be customized, it feels limited. Lack of ammunition and infrequent vendors means you will be switching to weapons found off the ground to make use of ammo for other weapons when your go-to guns are empty, especially in Ranger Mode where rounds are scarce and only 2 weapon slots are available. There is also less customization and decision-making involved, so the idea of tuning a weapon to fit your needs isn't in play as much as simply picking a shotgun up off the ground in exchange for your sniper. 

Prehaps greater are the outside missions, where you are placed somewhere in above-ground Moscow and told to get to point B. There are no humans to fight, no stealth sections, but there are the mutated beasts of the post-nuclear world. Every animal you fight against seems to be truly alive, swarms dance and circle around you in panicked sequences where you find yourself fighting for your life as mutants surround you. Between fights, you can wander about and collect essential loot and diary entries while ensuring that you regularly replace your gas mask filters and keep your flashlight powered. In the outside sections of the game, the mood is almost like STALKER in some aspects, although it is obvious the game leans more towards combat than survival. 

The game alternates between battle sections in which you have your weapon out and face opposition, and non-combat sections, in which you are in a friendly area and can listen in on conversations, buy and sell weapons and supplies and understand more about the Moscow Metro. Walking through the stations converted into underground cities and looking at the ramshackle construction using train cars as homes and fire extingushers as bells as well as listening in on the conversations people have gives the game a much better feeling of completeness, so to speak. It feels like you're actually fighting for something every time you exit the safety of the stations for the horrors of the tunnels and the surface. Unfortunately, there are no real interactions and while some may react to your presence, you cannot talk with anyone, so even then the game forces you to distance yourself from its characters. In addition, there are a few moments in battle sections where story is told through visions, flashbacks and diary entries.

Gameplay: Human encounters are tense, Mutant fights are frantic, survival is a game of keeping your head above water, all is well. 5/5
World: The game delivers on being grimdark and post-apocalyptic, but lack of interactivity sets it back. 4/5
Story: Antagonists sometimes feel irrelevant, and even Artyom's quest for redemption is overshadowed by the distance placed between you and everything else happening throughout the storyline. 2/5

I'm not gonna bullshit you, I'm a complete wuss when it comes to games that are supposed to give off a sense of dread and helplessness. That isn't to say that's what this game's all about because it fucking isn't at all. I always viewed this game as a thriller/horror-ish kind of shooter, and I'm glad to now know it's not. The game is a purely action/stealth based shooter, and I loved every moment of it. I didn't play ranger mode because I generally don't like to handicap myself in games, but I -did- play on hard, and I will say that provided you don't go out in the open like Call of Duty has you do, you shouldn't have much trouble with combat. 

Stealth is...well it's just a simple ""stay in the shadows"" kind of stealth. The enemies don't even notice you when you touch them in the darkness which kind of really dumbs down the stealth aspect of it. Also, you can pretty much just run up to any enemies and knock them out even when they're all shooting at you, so around the later chapters of the game I just went and knocked them out instead of wasting my time trying to sneak around them.

My main gripe with the game is its insistence on going stealthy, especially if you don't want the bad ending. I played through the game not realizing that getting into combat situations will give you such ending. It just didn't feel right to me.

I haven't tried the DLC missions yet, but I will edit the review when I've gone through them.

There's a cool mix of puzzle, survival horror, stealth, and combat in this game. The story is really cool and the setting is awesome. It's not a long game by any means, but it's very satisfying.

I highly reccomend the Ranger DLC, which basically enables the ""Ranger"" difficulty in the game. Ranger difficulty takes this from a run and gun type of game to something where you have to use your brain a little bit more to survive. There were a number of times where I had to restart a level from scratch because my descisions about ammo and filter usage would have made it impossible to complete. Normally starting a level from scratch wouldn't be something I'd enjoy, but they're short enough. As well, any time I made the level impossible to finish, I knew exactly what mistakes I made and was able to beat it on the 2nd go, so it didn't feel unfair at all.

If a game was released for XBOX and PS and then showed up on steam to purchase and you bought it for the PC and it did not work, you would be pissed. Same applies here, they specifically sell an OSX and LINUX version of this software.

Note 2: Edited, Linux version runs better than the Windows version on same hardware. Go figure?

Summary: A beautiful and very enjoyable game is marred by system incompatibility and, where not, marred by technical issues.

Poor support for adopted version of OSX. While some may argue ""You shouldn't play games on them"" or ""OSX is a known problem"", the reality is that Steam and the makers of Metro readily continue to accept money for  Metro Last Light and sell it as a finished game working for OSX. It simply does not work on OSX (Segfault: Metro Last Light has closed unexpectedly).

Moving over to Windows the game is beautiful, the prose in the intro is moving, the writing is great. There are still in-game glitches where stuttering (at almost random points, it appears to be due to the lighting at some points and PhysX) causes the game to be unplayable even when the action is low. Considering that I play other games that might be considered more demanding and with graphics just as high quality, I don't find this acceptable.

Moving over to Linux the game appears to run perfectly fine, it requires the newest Catalyst drivers (just installing fglrx from the repos did not cut it) but it *RUNS BETTER THAN THE WINDOWS VERSION ON THE SAME HARDWARE*",1403953483,1403958080,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First things first.  The game looks stunning.  It's a graphical work of art throughout and will completly amaze you through every tunnel, swamp, city wasteland and of course the metro.  The only game I can think of that can rival Metro Last Light in graphical fidelity is Crysis 3.  It's the best looking game I've ever played and we'll leave it at that.  

As for the game itself, there's a deep underying story here if you care to take your time and experience it.  This is not your typical run and gun shooter.  The pacing may be too slow for some who just want to get in there and shoot stuff, but if you take your time you will get a lot more out of the game.

There's a nice varity of weapons at your disposal and all of them are pretty unique.  You can purchase upgrades for them at various points in the game.  

As for the gameplay, there's a mix of stealth and guns blazing fights.  The choice is your's in some spots and in others your have no choice but to shoot everything in your way.  I like this set up as too many games these days force you to do too much stealth, which gets old.  The bad part of the gameplay is certainly the AI.  The enemies are down right stupid and easy to kill.  They will not try to flank you at all and just seem more interested in BSing with each other than anything else.

At any rate, if you've just spent a bunch of money on a high end gaming PC this is definitely you're going to want to get if just for the graphics alone.

The game is frustrating, as without a radar or map, it's hard to know where to go. Sure, the compass points you, but it's a compass -- so the direction may not be clear. Added frustration are the spiders in the game. They're light adverse and armored, so you need to shine your lighter/flash light on them in order to ""flip them over"" where you can kill them.

Ranger mode is a complete disaster, don't buy it, just try it. Go to the user.ltx and change difficulty and number to 4 for normal ranger or 5 for ranger hardcore. It upgrades every weapon in the game to 80% which makes everything just so easy considering AI is too stupid to use those weapons in action. Instead you find yourself assasinating everyone with stealth. Completely removes HUD and inventory so you are not aware which weapon you are picking up, you are not aware if you are about to throw a knife or a bottle of gasoline. In real life (which is what ranger mode promotes ""metro with realistic experience"") you just look at your left arm which is where all the explosives are attached. Ranger mode simply makes every weapon upgraded, making you a master easily killing every moster with literally, 3 shots of any gun. It also gives everyone alot more military grade ammo and makes you crippled and unaware of your own belongings.

The items are very unbalanced. How come you can carry an unlimited amount of heavy golden bullets but have a limit of only 5 anasthetic syringes? Why does the dynamo charger take 5 presses to fully charge a flashlight? My grandpa had one of those and I learned that 1 press will barely light the bulb. There is so much ammo everywhere. In 2033 you had just as much ammo but every single bullet was used on a monster, which is a good example of a balanced game. Here, we have a lot of ammo and not even enough space to carry and sell it all.

Nvidia can fuck off. As we all read in the credits, they are the ones who developed the visuals in the game. The amount of video options in the game is about 15% of what the engine is capable of tweaking but thats because this game is a Xbox 360 port. Have a look at the user.ltx file and you will find much more things to tweak along with the fact that this game is an xbox 360 port. This game was directly ported to OpenGL meaning all they did was take the DirextX code, translated it into the OpenGL code and they got a big mishmosh of shit with even more memory leaks because the original PC game is a port. When they ported the game to OpenGL allowing it to run on Mac and Linux they purposely got rid of all the video options (even resolution and v-sync) to make it look bad, but once again, this can all be changed if you know how to modify the user.ltx. Those dicks try to make OpenGL and AMD look bad by purposly scripting their old-as-fuck physics engine to ultimately fail on AMD cards within every physical particle as well as other operating systems.

The gunplay is superb and when running on a great computer it is seamless and wonderful to play around with the wide array of weapons. Now the graphics.... Wow!

There will be moral choices for you as a person, something might change in the end?

There is a bunch of different weapons and gear for you to use and customize. Unlike 2033 you can add suppressors and other attachments to your weapons to make you a silent killer or a high capacity brute.

Last Light is a sequel to Metro 2033 so I would recommend a play through before you start with this. Overall I was pretty suprised by the content of this sequel, I was highly ammused through the entire game.

This game is one of a kind, but not in a bad way. I don't understand why this isn't a popular game. The game is absouletly fabulous, although if you don't have a NVIDIA card I would recommend research before buying. The game is not as linear as it may seem, and there is plenty of stuff to do in game. Metro Last Light is not like other games that give you a tutorial and then have you kill endless amounts of people, the Metro is different. The game is always adding cool little things even till the last ""level."" The story is pretty good in my opinion and the people who complain about the voice acting are the same people who complain about graphics in pokemon (who cares).

With such an epic story surrounding the game I was a bit timid trying the Metro series of Video Games.  Since after all, Many times we have had a rich universe surrounding a game that fell short of expectations or PR/Marketing teams that pushed a product that again fell short.

With Metro Last Light however you can feel safe in knowing that it certainly doesnt fall short of the hype.  A dark and oppresive feeling surrounds you as you face that which lurks in the darkness.  With quick responding controls, a sountrack worthy of a movie and gameplay elements that immerse you in your surroundings its impossible to go wrong with Metro Last Light.

PRO's; 
-Gorgeous, Nearly Unmatched presentation with great visual variety of locations, voice acting and attention to detail. Still rivals cryengine games today.
-Good arsenal of (sometimes generic) weapons, some weapons also have some kind of a unique twist to them (no spoilers0.
-Long-ish campaign, easily 9-12 hours of content in first playthrough to justify purchase.
-Great optimization on my rig, with a GTX 770 2GB and a Intel 4670k with 8gb of DDR3 RAM achieves a smooth framerate on almost all ultra settings, with SSAA turned off (Butt rapes my framerate)
-Got this on steam sale (7$ at this time, great value for money.
- Survival Elements in an already terrific linear shooter, this adds so more depth so you can't just faceroll the game without consequences.
- Well pulled off stealth system, vast improvement of 2033. I highly recommend you use stealth takedowns before any surface sections to perseve/gather ammo, you don't want to go up there low on ammo. Can get very brutal....

Con's;
-Pretty Linear, some exploration in the environment but different paths to your objectives could offer more replayability.
-Very punishing on the surface sections of the game, Disregard if your ready to run out of ammo.
-Not very much interaction between the character and the story, as in you don't really decide anything, just follow others orders taking a back seat with a silent (but not in cutscenes) protagnist.
-Social Warriors gather your torches and Pitchforks, women are not ""Properly"" portrayed in this story., there are also no other people from opposite genders, and the previous games antagonists were called ""The Dark Ones!!!"".
- Not all that great boss battles, all of em are pretty much the same and on the surface, goodbye ammo it was nice know you.

- the gunplay is weak as shit and the ak feels like a pellet gun
- the monster enemies, especially the spiders, are awful to fight since they'll mostly just gang up on you and there's limited hiding space because you're mostly just walking down corridors
- stealth was way too simple and unsatisfying
- the COD-like structure of the early stuff basically harpooned any goodwill i might've had for the later levels. the absolute worst thing you can do in an action game is have the main character trip and fall just because you wanted to give your  awesome NPC a cool action scene.

PROS:
+Stunning visuals: game is simply gorgeous. New engine surely does well with the lighting. Artstyle os the game is matching to the distopean story.
+Trully immersive atmosphere. Game creates claustrophobic and depressing atmosphere everywhere, the ""cities"" are run down, poor, and dirty. Metro itself, even if there is nothing around, will create a feeling of depression and you will always feel that someone is watching you. The city is destroyed and only monsters remain, creating the true feeling of being alone and you are feeling that you have no chances here at all.
+Improved gunplay. Strictly mechanically this game improves on the originals a bit dodgy gunplay. stealth is a bit improved, but enemies will swarm you as soon as you miss, they will instantly know where you are.
CONS:
-Lack of difficulty. On Normal the game is far too easy, bullets are abundant (i ran out of them once on one gun) i would suggest cracking up to harder difficulty from the start.
-Ranger difficulty is a DLC. I cannot just forgive this atrocity to the devs. The  ""true way to play the game"" is locked behind a pay wall.

CONCLUSION:
Buy this game, it is a must have. Trully a maasterpiece, the little negatives are outweighted by the humongous positives.

after playing Metro 2033, I found this game rather dull and 'cheap', things aren't fair. not in the ""fun"" way, where the enemy is stronger or smarter than you or even there are just too many, but in the superficial way, where you physically can not carry enough ammunition to get you through the level; even when head-shotting everything, or the bosses force you to shoot them with 2-3 mags of ammunition (against their bullet-proof armor) before they show you their week spot; just for the sake of making the game seem more dramatic. There are many times where the game/characters will tell you to shoot at some monster, and it doesn't matter how many rounds you fire into it's head, the game will not let it die until some special cut scene has played.

What I liked about this game was the things they improved on from 2033, like being able to take filters off of enemy gas masks, and being able to turn off headlamps on dead enemies if you're doing a stealth approach. I also like the choice between knocking out your enemy or killing them if you take the stealth approach. If it's not clear already, I think the best way to play this is with stealth, though there are some parts where that's not really the best option. I'd give the story and immersion a good 9/10, it's what makes me love this game

What I didn't like about this game, is that like 2033, there are some strangely designed enemies. Not just difficult enemies, but just irritating, in their animations and how quickly they attacked. It was almost laughable how overpowered they were when they could corner you. Also I didn't feel as involved with the story as much as I was in 2033, and I think that's because in this game they made it feel more like a video-game storyline, rather than the indepth book-like storytelling of 2033. Even with this though, re-doing the missions with some of the annoying enemies over and over again was the main low point of this game, but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Over-all I highly recommend this game, but just keep in mind I finished it in 10 hours, so like 2033, it's a very thoroughly enjoyable story but it doesn't last for too long by today's content standards. Also that's with doing missions over and over again because I sucked at some of them.

The best part is that there is no HUD, no health bar, no annoying instructions, no ""stealth meters"" or objectives. You get a few guns and you're thrust into the enemy, and you truly have the option to sneak around or kill them all head on; plenty of times I took the long way around when I could have just turned off the lights to my right to hide and saved 10 minutes of detouring!

- one of the best looking games currently available for PC
- great story
- authentic characters
- nice turns and small surprises in story line
- great level design

The issue is that the frame rate drop like crazy at random moments for extended periods of time to less than 17 FPS. Alot of forums said to disable PhysX or Update Drivers to fix the issue. However, i did both and still and random moments in the game i would get huge framerate drops. It's not even that its a big scene or an action packed scene that the frame rate will drop in, it will be when you open a door, pass through a certain parts of the map where the frame rate is intollerabe.

onto the meat of the experience, i felt the stealth elements were a bit overbearing on the challenge difficulty, in some cases i felt more like i was toying with enemies instead of trying to sneak past them. though i have to say they definitely made the difficulty scale better instead of how it felt like it was a yoyo in the first.

the guns were excellent. they felt like they were made under less than ideal conditions, but well maintained. some even showed some enginuity you would be hard pressed to find outside of an apocalyptic setting. and the ability to customize the parts of the guns at shops was a very nice touch. being able to mount a silencer onto most weapons or a combat sight and make the weapons actually feel like their YOURS instead of what you slavaged off some dead merc makes all the difference.

i got about 11 hours out of the main story and i think i might be able to get a few more out of the extra content so the price of 15USD might be appropriate for a buy if you plan to play through the entire game but if you're only coming for the main story dont buy it till its under 10USD.",1403592423,1403592423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just wanted to be ""let loose"" to explore a bit but it's so linear I don't think there is much to explore besides the odd room or two off the railroad tracks.  Then before you know it your NPC friend bekons you to help him up into yet another mini cut scene.

On the plus side this game has tons of atmosphere and the weapons are well done with plenty of ""punch"".  The problem is; I want to like Metro: Last Light but it just doesn't work for me.  I may give it's predecessor, Metro 2033, a play and see if it's any different.",1403566662,1403566662,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are characters returning from Metro 2033 as well as some intriguing new ones who are well written and help to making the game that much more rich.

It is possible to play this game going in all guns blazing however this approach isn't encouraged, at least not on Ranger difficulties. A stealthy approach is much more effective and satisfying. There is even the option to take out enemies in a non-lethal fashion and as this game has a subtle karma system the non lethal approach may be more appealing. It all depends on how you want to play it. There are a few instances of horror in Metro: Last Light which are really well done and I would even go as far as to say they are on par with some of the scariest games out there. They may not last that long but they are a refreshing break from normal gameplay and help spice things up and keep you on your toes.

A continuation from the ""Bad"" Ending of Metro 2033
If you liked Metro 2033, you need to play this. It would be like leaving a book half finished if you didn't.
Like 2033, Last Light builds an incredibly immersive world through its sound, visuals, lore, story, and gameplay.
While it obviously features a lot in common with 2033, I felt that Last Light offered enough differences in gameplay, weaponry, and story to become a proper sequel that doesn't just feel like a repeat of 2033. 
There are several noticeable changes if you just came from Metro 2033

-All of the weapons reload faster (this is accredited to Artym being a Ranger instead of just some guy now)

-The attachment system is a little different, and later in the game, enemies may have near fully upgraded weapons. This makes swapping and using different weapons far more forgiving than in Metro 2033 where if you dropped your long barrel revolver, you'd pretty much never ever see another one in the game again.

-New weapons. I like that 4A did not go overboard with the weapons, they didn't feel the need to revamp the entire weapon scheme. There are a lot of returning guns, but they offer you a couple more, like 2 different bolt actions, (one being regular and ""heavy""), the Saiga 12 (which you can put a drum on, recommend.), and some others.

-Suits. The way suits work is streamlined. You get a hazard suit to travel the surface. You get a giant heavy suit for the end of the game firefight, etc. I guess it takes some choice away, but I'm not sure picking suits was the main draw of 2033.

-Stealth. They really dumbed down the stealth in Last Light from 2033. Instead of your neato green/yellow/red watch, Artym has a watch that glows or doesn't glow blue when you can/cannot be seen. Instead of varying degreees of stealth, it's just an all or nothing deal. You pretty much crouch in the dark and are completely invisible. It's definitely the biggest change from Metro 2033 in terms of game mechanics and I was definitely  a little deflated when I was playing the game and realized how simple the stealth mechanics were.

The Metro universe is conveyed fantastically in Last Light, just like its predecessor. Being a linear game, you only travel through it for the sake of your objective, but there are many many parts in the game where you can eavesdrop on various conversations among metro dwellers and enemies. They share personal stories, news, and pieces of lore otherwise unmentioned in the game. I tried to listen to every single one I could find, but even at that I'm sure I missed a few. The dialogue is just really cool. At one point a soldier will mention an event that took place as a level in 2033 where all the Nazis and Commies on a warfront were found dead, saying it's a mystery what killed everyone (hint: it was Artym, Savior of the motherfucking Metro). Tid-bits like these really helps to build the sense that the world is larger than what you see. It's not just something built for the game; it's more like the game is just a story set within the Metro universe. I recommend playing it in your native language first, since side conversations are usually not subbed. (sidenote: amazing voice acting.)

The pacing is good, as the story takes off pretty fast, and the game introduces you to some unique mechanics. (at first, there's an animation to unscrew lightbulbs, making the game a bit more cinematic, but later on there isn't because you don't want to watch yourself unscrew a million lights do you?) If you snoop around, you'll find more than enough bullets (currency) as well as  powerful, customized weapons. Certain sections kind of cater to certain guns (catacombs, saiga 12), but if that's the case they'll usually plop down the weapon before you need in a 'HINT HINT, TAKE THIS' fashion. That said, you can go through the majority of the game using whichever weapons you want, as well as deciding if you want to use stealth or not. The stealth takedowns are pretty neat. There's the typical knockout or stabbing people's throats, but you can also stealth takedown people from the front if you're fast enough. That one's pretty cool. you slap their weapon out of the way as they draw it and punch them in the face. There's also your throwing knives, bbgun, Hellsing, and silenced weapons.

There is a hidden Karma System like Metro 2033, listening to people's stories all the way through, as well as discovering secrets and being nice will get you good Karma, denoted by a blue flash and whispers, while being a dick, and killing ANY bad guys not needed for beating the game will get you bad karma, denoted by a red flash and angry whispers (except for killing bad guys). The killing people thing wasn't obvious, so I ended up getting the bad ending. Do a lot of stealth knockouts if you want the good ending.

I haven't mentioned the story much because I don't want to spoil it. Basically, there's 1 surviving child Dark One. You've gotta go get it, plans go awry, you end up getting caught in the midst of an upcoming Communist-Nazi war. Artym ponders some stuff and you continue to be a total badass. There's a hot sniper girl and some good friends who help you along the way.

I really recommend getting the character levels. While short, They take place in the same time period as Last Light, and show how certain characters ended up where they turn up again while we were following Artym who was too busy killing everything. The faction pack is similarly short, besides the ranger level, which involves exploring a circular 'open-world' map where you explore and find artifacts. It's pretty neat.

Ranger mode takes away the ENTIRE hud (even the pad to see which throwable item you've selected, they're denoted by sound i.e. fire for firebombs, a shiiiing for throwing knives, etc.) It even takes away your inventory screen which tells you how much money you have and whatnot, which seems a bit more irritating than difficult, eh. Guess I'm not hardcore.


All in all, Last Light is an amazing game and a worthy successor to Metro 2033. I felt that everything was quite fulfilling (except maybe the stealth system.) Go buy it. Click the button.",1403465524,1403465524,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After completing the game, I realize that this game is much more than just a pretty face. The audio in this game is fantastic. More specifically, gun audio is unbelievable. It's as if you can hear the bare steel of the action sliding back and forth as you let loose your lead vengeance. Each bullet is fired with such heaviness and impact that it reminds you of the desolation that is Metro. The only other game which comes close to this fidelity of gun audio is RAGE - another one of my favorites. 

As I've alluded to in the beginning, the visuals of this game is as trend setting as Crysis was in its day. It is exceptionally rare that we get a game that looks gorgeous and yet still runs smooth (Played with an overclocked GTX 680). All too often, PC gamers get stuck with ports that not only look dated, but is as bloated and slow as Cartman running the Boston marathon - I'm looking at you Batman Arkham Origin, GTA IV, Watch Dogs. This is NOT the case with Metro. But hey, if a picture is worth a thousand words, then video should be worth 60,000 words per second (assuming 60FPS) so go watch a gameplay video to see for yourself!

Being new to the Metro franchise, I was a weary of the gameplay, but thankfully that was not an issue. I started the game with normal difficulty and moved onto hardcore. Gas masks were never an issue with me and there are always sufficient bullets to take down the baddies - but there was a time where I was literally down to my last bullet. Overall, I would classify Last Light as an action-fps with spooky moments than a straight survival horror.

Moving onto plot. There are no major plot twists or turns and I could've seen the bad guy coming from a mile away - but that doesn't necessarily mean it was a bad game. Even though I got the 'bad' ending, which was frankly a little disappointing, the journey to the end was so good that I didn't care about the plot.

This is a 2013 game with metascore of 82 (Review date June 22 2014) . It's also regularly on steam sales at less than $10. The only question left is why are you reading my review and not playing it!",1403438915,1403438959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was somewhat disappointed when I bought it a few months back, as it wasn't scaling properly on my CrossFire setup. That seems to have been resolved now with the latest drivers, and it looks fantastic and runs well now (over 90% utilisation across both cards). The game has great graphics, lighting effects, and this time around a bit more colour at times as well. The story is fairly engrossing, although perhaps not quite to the same level as Metro 2033. The concept of the ""Dark Ones"" and the moral points is interesting, although fairly superficial as you might expect in a linear story driven game like this. Sort of 'boss' fights have been included, which makes a nice change from just getting swarmed by increased numbers. Now what is not so great is the shooting mechanics still don't feel quite as good as in some other games, and the claustrophobic feeling is I imagine conveyed as the developers intended, but exaggerated and more disorientating than I would have preferred, perhaps due to what felt like a low field of view at times (you can't adjust it). I also encountered a strange bug; the reload and gas mask keys stopped working. I pressed on thinking it would fix itself. It didn't and I got to a point where it was impossible to progress without a gas mask. I had to go back 4 or 5 chapters to fix it, unfortunately. However overall I enjoyed my time with this game; the Metro series is one of my favourites and I recommend you give this and Metro 2033 a try if you haven't already - if you want to showcase the power of your hardware and might enjoy a cinematic post apocalyptic story adventure, you won't be disappointed.",1403437541,1403437541,True,3,0,0.542072653770446777,0,True,False,False

The next issue that I had the game is not applicable to all.  It is that in many parts of the game, you are alone, not guided by anyone.  During these times, you have to try and kill everyone without being noticed.  After everyone in the room is dead, you have to find the exit.  I found this part of the game pretty stupid.  As you have no map or instruction, even when clues are turned on, you have to work your way around an almost unlit room until you find a tiny crevice where you escape.

However, after I got it I made the transition to being a PC gamer, and didnt get around to playing Last Light sense i would have had to pay full price again. Now, that i have picked it up on a sale and finally fulfilled my craving, I can say this game is in all ways, a BETTER game then its first installment. Now of course the developers worked out a few bugs, but aside that, in 2033 there was some issues with the stealth, and shooting mechanics. If you could look past that it was a great game, so this one...having no bugs in the stealth or shooting, is fantastic. You continue Artyom's story one year after the ""bad ending"" or more like the neutral ending of the first game. *SPOILER* This means that after you nuked the Dark Ones, and the ""good"" ending didnt happen. Assuming this, you pick up Artyom's story again. And the traditional combat between humans, mutants, and....neither....are all there as well as some fun bosses. Try the game on ranger hardcore mode if you want a challenge. If you beat 2033 on ranger hardcore...well your decently prepared, but take care on those bosses. If you find yourself running out of ammo on them, load up the last checkpoint, or the last chapter, and conserve your ammo and look for hidden caches. I gurantee it will help.

The game is very beautiful and really captures the feel of surviving in a post apocalyptic environment.  This is in large part due to the claustrophobia of the game enforced by the fact that outside of the underground tunnels  you must wear a gas mask.  This is tremendous in terms of feel and for the added tension since you only have so many filters, and thusly, only so much time that you can spend above ground.  This is simultaneously one of the best, and disappointing aspects of the game.  Scrambling for extra filters, all the while hearing your breath become more labored as the filters run dry, is a great. This would be an excellent mechanic in an open world game, sadly, Metro is anything but open world in that respect.  This is probably my biggest gripe about the game.  This game almost demands that it be open world and I would love the opportunity to explore outside the confines of the story.

The fact the game is incredibly linear isn't an issue when you have a very strong story but that isn't the case for Metro.  That isn't to say that the story is bad, it isn't, it's just serviceable with a pretty predictable arc if you've been around the gaming block a few times.

The game play is solid with my only complaints being that sneaking felt rather forced and the boss battles a little frustrating in that you will empty entire clips of ammunition to no real discernible effect.

All in all it is a pretty good game and I enjoyed the time I played it.",1403303398,1403303398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

More in depth: The graphics are incredible, anyone with a decent rig + monitor should purchase this game to enjoy one of the most immersive games on the market. The game itself gives players a very solid linear FPS experience, one that can be finished in under 12 hours. I Played on hardcore mode, which proved to be very challenging and rewarding which is another aspect i loved from this game. I mean, having to fend of waves of Watchers while you try to run corners in dire attempts to recover health and tactically lay claymores while doing so. It gave me the kind of excitement that is somewhat lost in most FPS titles these days. In saying this however, waves of Watchers, Lurkers, Spiderbugs etc, seem to be a repeated process throughout the game. Waves of enemies can be exciting yes, but having to do so again and again definately diluted the fear factor associated mutant enemies to the point it became a predictable, repetitive process.

On another negative note, the characters that are met throughout the game arent really given much time to be developed to the point where the game is played for the story. It is understandable that a short linear FPS wont usually engage players with characters too much, however considering the seemingly complex storyline, the short interactions with key characters didnt do the storyline much justice.
To conclude,
While the story itself isnt very memorable and the characters less so, the predictable gameplay mechanics paired with the highly immersive experience and excitable gameplay definately outweighed its negative aspects. Its a game worthy of 7.5/10 rating, however this review is possibly skewed by the fact the game was performed on a 780ti i5 rig with a 120hz monitor. Bear in mind that running with lower graphics will probably diminish the immersive value this game offers, which is its strongest point.",1402817644,1402817644,True,5,1,0.561752974987030029,0,True,False,False

As far as Last Light goes, this game is amazing. It is even better than 2033, which is a fantastic game in itself. The graphics are amazing, the story is great, though the voice acting could use a little work. All in all, would recommend to anyone looking for a great FPS and RPG.

Last Light is a brilliant follow up and feels like a much better game and a worthy sequel to it's already brilliant predecessor. Last Light carries on the story a few months after the first game and see's you playing again as Artyom, the protaganist from the first game. Last Light starts with you hearing about a Dark One sighting with Artyom tasked to go and find itand things go from there with a much stronger and enjoyable story than the first game.

The Good: 
- the game looks great with the fantastic atmospheric settings ranging from the dank creepy Metro underground and the haunting ruined city of Moscow above.
- I enjoyed the story a lot more this time round with more insight into the Dark Ones as well as getting to see and learn more about the various factions in the Metro like the Nazi's and Red's. I found the story was one of the games strongest points.
- The atmosphere in this game is brilliant and it manages to be genuinely creepy and unnerving at times. 
- The game feels a lot more polished compared to it's predecessor.

The Bad:
- There isn't anything really new or innovating about this game but this wasn't a major problem for me.
- The AI isn't amazing it's quite easy at times to sit back and pick off enemies while they hide behind cover.

While the graphics look as good as the previous Metro, the problem I had was some sort of strange slowdown. I can play Skyrim on the highest setting had less slowdown than MLL on the lowest. My video card is a Radeon 7800 2GB, 6 core AMD processor and 16 GB of memory. Using the lowest settings this is mostly playable, but still gets massive slowdown when there is just some enemy movement and fighting going on. Slowdown does not seem to happen consistently either. As I said, never had this much problem with an amped up Skyrim with a handfull of mods. 

At the very beginning I became immersed in the environment of the game, until I realized just how linear the game is. You have such a narrow path for each area that there is little exploring to be done. Secret areas and alternate paths consist of a side room down the tunnel. 

Next up is the ranger mode where the game tries to get you more immersed into it. The concept sounds great, but you will quickly find why in practice it is not so good. Without any kind of a hud, you will find it difficult to determine you immediate ammo supply or even which weapon you are using. Some of the rifles look extremely similar when the character holds them. The problem is that the Ranger mode has no inventory screen. None whatsoever! Want to find out how many medkits, filters or ammo you have left? Nope. Like I said, the theory behind it sounds awesome in concept, but without any way to check on supplies is just stupid. 

The morality based endings are stupid... or at least how it is calculated on which one you get. Specifically, that invisible meter that tells you if you are doing good or not, and how much one way or another will change the ending. The idea behind it is great, but that hidden meter should not change simply due to talking to people and hearing their stories or listening to backround dialogue. And giving ammo to beggars means you are a good person? Blindly giving out money (or in this case ammo) to a beggar does not mean you are a good person, it just means you are satisfying them 'for the moment' and not doing any 'real' good for them. In real life I give beggars a business card for job opportunities or food - real, tangible help. I have always hated the idea in video games that not giving money to a beggar is considered a bad moral choice. Apparently playing musical instruments also constributes to a good ending? Some of these do not make any sense. The lack of any kind of 'goodness meter' is annoying but understandable to some degree, but I hate that I have no idea if or where I missed some inane dialogue that may have helped give me the 'good' ending. I would much rather have 4 or 5 choice based options throughout the game that would determine the ending or even one based off the time spent playing the game. Something a little more solid would have been nice. I will play this how I want and youtube the other ending. 

I bought this game for 10$ and I am quickly finding it was 'barely' worth it. I should have waited for a better steam sale as I feel that 5$ would have been more appropriate",1402007291,1402034024,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've never felt more relieved and comforted in any other game than I have in Metro, coming out of a tense struggle for survival through the mutant-infested tunnels and bandit camps to a warm, bustling home station, to stock up on supplies, enjoy the presence of other people, and just sit down and listen to some guy playing guitar, tipping him as I make my way onwards to my next destination.

Ranger Hardcore is just as good as ever, though it does hide elements of the UI that get somewhat lost in translation (not sure when to press E to not die during some very rare cinematics so I mash it whenever something's attacking me, can't tell what I'm selecting on the Tab menu except for by sound) but all these are silly nitpicks.

Let's start with things I didn't like (I know some of these are really minor problems):
- I saw a graphics glitch once
- Glitching animations when grabbing a mug or taking a seat (float in the air)
- Invisible fences everywhere. Whereever the game does not want you to go, it simply does not let you, even though it looks as if you could get there. This is especially obvious in the ""cities"", but happens on the surface aswell.
- The factions: the good order, the bad commies and the bad nazis (though they are russian and called ""Reich"", even the ingame characters call them nazis). Seriously?! This is so unimaginative. This game is set in 21. century postapocalyptic Moscow, still the main factions are pretty much taken directly from the global factions of the 1940s (With the order being the Allied Forces). The developers could have had better ideas (then again there is a novel on which the game is based).
- The boobs jiggle waaaaaaaay too much. It looks really ridiculous. Otherwise the strippers are really hot though (there are strippers by the way).
- At some parts the ammo scarcity is unbalanced. I know you are supposed to reserve your shots, but especially during one underground level I had to shoot almost all my military rounds (which are used as money in trade), because I had to blast my way through countless waves of watchmen before encountering the tough boss, while finding no resupply at all on the way.
- The sneaking system is rather unrealistic. You have a watch that lights up, when you are visible and goes out, when you are not. It is already sufficient to stand in some ""half-shadow"" to be undetectable for your enemies, regardless of their distance to you. Also your enemies never detect a stealth kill, even if it happens right beside or behind them (sound of punching/slitting a throat, body falling) unless the body is illuminated (visible just like yourself) and in their line of sight, or they happen to litteraly stumble upon it during a patrol. That being said it is a working sneaking mechanic, it's just not super realistic, if someone cares. The one thing that really bothers me though about sneaking is the AI. The npcs like to just face a wall or corner and stand in front of it for half a minute. It would make sense if they were keeping watch out of a window or studying a picture or whatever but this is plain stupid.
- You are forced to buy all the dlc's with the game. They include the ranger mode, which really should be available in the main game, and the rest are bonus missions that you can start from the main menu. They prolong the game experience a bit but they are not overly special. If I had the chance I would not have bought them.
- The game is not very long, the main story took me maybe around 10 hours. On the other hand this is a normal time for this kind of linear gameplay.
- No stripper in the museum.

Those were some things I did not like, now the good stuff:
- Great atmosphere.
- Immersive surroundings, lots of dialogue happening around you, that makes the habitated places feel just a little lively.
- Strippers, getting drunk, crashing a bar.
- Stunning graphics, it's been a long time I was this satisfied with views.
- Great range of weapons to choose from, all upgradeable with modifications. I only found that the sniper rifles don't really pay off, since all the enemies close in so fast on you.
- Interactive world: charging your flashlight battery, wiping your muddy/bloody/cracked gas mask (the cracks don't go away), plucking a guitar string, knock on doors to hear funny reactions and turn out the lights. This is very important for the sneaking parts.
- Overall fun shooting parts and fierce bosses.

My paragraph about the cons turns out to be much longer, but don't let that decieve you. This game is a fun experience and was totally worth the 10 € I paid during the sale (I still recommend you to do the same).",1401895667,1401895667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The shooting elements are highly refined, and unlike the original, stealth actually works-- in any type of shadow, you are invisible to the enemy. Simple. The first time you sneak up behind a guy, smash his faceplate, slit another's throat and put a throwing knife through the third you'll marvel at how easy it was-- and how much of a badass you are. The atmosphere is also quite involving; all the areas you visit feel lived-in and rife with history, and the characters talk like real folks with sharp dialogue that doubles as world-building. My favorite part of the game however is the way it discourages you from all-out carnage through character growth; Artyum is on a quest for penance, and every inch of the journey reminds you of humanity's crimes, as well as your own. That the game manages to walk that line throughout the duration without feeling preachy is a marvel. It also ends on a note of shocking finality, discouraging any chance of a sequel, which is pretty bold these days.

Set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow which was destroyed by nuclear war. A small handful of the population managed to seek shelter in the subway tunnels beneath the city. Twenty years have passed, the world has become inhabited with mutants and the surviving population has broken up into various factions.

Featuring a strong narrative and great pacing, Metro will keep you immersed the entire time. The story is told through eyes of a ranger named Artyom and not through irritating and pacing-breaking cutscenes like a lot of other games. Journal entries can also be found and Artyom serves as a narrator who often talks about the events unfolding around him.

It’s the direct sequel to Metro 2033 but playing the first title isn’t required to enjoying the game.

Metro Last Light tries to do a bit of everything, it’s primarily a first person shooter but it incorporates stealth elements very well. It also feels like a survival horror at points and can be quite tense when you venture out onto the irradiated surface with a gas mask. The audio is great and the screams of mutants in the distance will always keep you on the edge of your seat. There is a fairly large variety of enemies which are all hideous, unique and well done.

The atmosphere is amazing, same with the graphics. It’s worth noting that a somewhat powerful computer is required to running Metro Last Light.

Metro Last Light also has multiple endings and plenty of re-playability. It may appear linear early on but it quickly branches out later allowing plenty of room for exploration. this is one of the best games every make",1401802509,1401802509,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game tends to throw you on your own to fend for yourself and also leaves you with a large world to explore and find items and weapons. Ammo and filters are very valueblea nd are not to be overlooked. There are moments that gives you chills and others that just leave you wondering and curious. So much to find out and explore. The pace off the game is great and there are no lame cutscenes that ruin the mood. The graphics are great and fit the atmosphere. A must buy!,1401572797,1401572797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Similar to its predecessor, Metro 2033, Last Light's gameplay plays the same as the modern Call of Duty campaigns. Last Light's reliance on scripted encounters take any a lot of the initative while exploring the dark Metro under Moscow. Half the time it isn't clear if you made a mistake or if the encounter with a flying beast was scripted in. Despite the rigidness of Last Light campaign its strength comes from the story. The developers invested themselves in the project, taking time to develop the story.

TL;DR - Metro: Last Light is a solid, atmospheric (expect to hear this word alot for this series) First Person Shooter that puts an end caps on Artyom's journey from Metro 2033. The production value is among the best in AAA games and the gameplay has no majors errors, beyond a few scripting/AI Bugs and being a mostly standard linear shooter. You play MLL for three reasons: PC Benchmarking/graphical observation. immersive, gritty, horror-based atmosphere, and story. While the gameplay is good, and fans of stealth will enjoy stealth friendly gameplay options, there's not much here that you haven't seen before.

-=Presentation=-
I'm not sure if I really need to say anything about the presentation as everything that needed to be said about this game has already been said better elsewhere. Graphically, MLL is practically this generation's Crysis, requiring good hardware to run at the higher settings. Unfortunately, there aren't much in depth video controls in the options menu - you may have to change those externally - but you have the option to change resolution, texture quality (or maybe it's overall quality including models), Anti-aliasing, and Antiostropic Filtering. World design is wonderfully dreary, though does succumb to greybrown syndrome that so many shooters have - thankfully, there are some points in the game with flora and fauna, and you will see occasional splotches of color due to mushrooms, water, fire, light sources, and Artyom's Gear. All in game models appear highly detailed and textured, and there is great effects and very good lighting. It still has that typical ""Video game sheen"", but everything looks good enough to place you in the setting.

The setting is well enhanced by the sound design, as you hear screams, roars, and echoes throughout the Metro. The Shotgun and sniper has a good punch though I can't speak for the other weapons as I used silencers. The music is perfectly ambient for each locale and moment - dark and foreboding empty segments, exciting during gunfights and stealth segments, creepy and/or scary in more terrifying moments. None of it is something I'd add to my soundtrack collection though - it isn't bad at all, it's just isn't listening kind of music (and I have tons of game music). Two problems with sound design: 1) in crowded areas when you are trying to listen to NPC conversation, it may clash with other conversations, and it doesn't help when the subtitles doesn't work for some NPC conversations and is mostly focused on story conversations - so if somebody is walking you though a city, you may need two sets of brains to listen to different conversations. 2) I've read complaints about the voice acting and suggestions with playing it in Russian. I played Metro 2033 in Russian and regretted it because some speech wasn't subtitled. The voice acting here sounds good to me, though the children all definitely sound like adults trying to emulate children, but they deserve an ""A for effort"". I guess you can say the adults all sound like ""typical stereotypical Russian accents"", but I don't know what else to expect - it's fine if you ask me.

The major issue is the stability of this as a program. The game itself is mostly fine - I've only had one scripting bug where a creature that was supposed to surprise attack me in a QTE got stuck in geometry. I've read people complain about AI Pathing issues, which now that I remember, there were a couple oddities where a guard was running in circles an flying upstares and another running back and forth in place. Those are rare. My biggest issue is that this game is NOT ALT+TAB friendly. It crashes 70% of the time I ALT+TAB, though, not all the time, which is strange.

-=Gameplay=-
It's a linear scripted shooter. You go down a set path, and any deviations leads to dead ends that take you back to the main path. You reach invisible walls and doors that can't be passed until a certain scripted event occurs. You pass points of no return where you can't go back a level or before a checkpoint. At least you can restart a chapter or checkpoint easily though. It's like most AAA action games these days that aren't sandbox, which is fine, since it never sold itself as a roaming game like Fallout. 

This game is all about the story and atmospheric immersion and if you're interested in the post-apocalyptic, mostly underground setting (with occasional romps through the radiated and harmful outdoors) and care enought about how Artyom and the Order handles the oncoming war, then this game is for you. After all, this game was based on a book, so it's all about story. I found myself however, not being able to follow the story well, when characters are introduced and then taken out, or not being sure what I'm doing or why I'm doing it. This is mostly my fault, since I'm very forgetful and it didn't help that I played the first few hours months before I played the remainder of the game. I just prefer that most games have character and location introductions and/or HUD info showing the name. This is probably from being spoiled from other games or not needing to know the story of Mario and Sonic. (Important NPCS do name themselves and their names come up in dialogue, I just have a problem remembering details and I start rushing through linear games to just get them out my backlog.). I can't give you a fair opinion about the story because of this, but the story seems good to me and I did like how my game ended.

Gunplay feels good and satisfying. Shotguns have good punch. Machine guns are reasonably accurate, though are a bit weak due to the dirty bullets - military grade bullets which is also your currency solves that problem. I didn't use any pnuematic weapons this time, but they were effective and enjoyable in Metro 2033 (specfically the Tihar) and I'm sure it's the same here. Sticky Grenades are gone, but you have fire bombs and claymores, but regular grenades and throwing knives are still here. I rarely had to use any of those since grouped up enemies were not common, and waiting for headshots worked for me. (Hard mode is probably a bit different, which I played in 2033, but not this one). Hidden loot and notes can be found off the beaten path. You have to manage your valueable military ammo as you consider weapon upgrades and swaps - generally it's a better idea just to find a better weapon, though I didn't use my MGRs that often either - ammo was plentiful in mormal mode, and I'm not going to pay $5 to buy Ranger mode, that's stupid.

-=Conclusion=-
There's very little I can say bad about this game. Anybody looking for a story driven, immersive experience with solid gunplay will find it here. I got this because I had the previous game and figured I should clear them off my backlog. My ""Maybe"" comes soley from the fact that I'm starting to think I don't care for these type of shooters. I'm more into the ""Video gamey"" experience with shooters like Unreal Tournament, C0D4/Uncharted/Mass Effect Multiplayer, or games more like DOOM, Duke Nukem 3D, Goldeneye 007, and Metroid Prime. Less of the linear, storytelling, placesetting style games (I'm sure I'm being semi-hypocritical somehow). If you have seen game footage that made you think you'd like the game and want to know if it's good, it is.",1400942574,1400942574,True,2,0,0.531319737434387207,1,True,False,False

First , for the purpose of how this game runs for me I'll share my hardware specs : i7 3820 CPU, 16 gigs RAM, Nvidia 670 GTX GPU, Windows 8.1 OS (64 bit)

Second, disclaimer up front - though I enjoy and appreciate a solid FPS game --- the FPS genre as a whole is not my favorite and I'm also what you would call a mediocre - average PvPer in FPS games.

All that stuff out of the way -- I found the story pretty good, it definitely didn't suck but at the same time its no masterpiece either. It hits a bit on all the essential elements --- discovering a mystery , revenge, the heroic helping out of your ""comrades"" out and even a sliver of sex/romantic (though its a pretty thin sliver).

I will say one of the strong points for me is the game does a better than average job of setting up a mood of danger...and I like that a lot in a game. there are parts in the game where I actually was honestly thinking ""oh shit.....something bad is going to happen here"" and I found myself actually have goosebumps on my arms at a few points. That's cool , IMO, when a game can make the player feel that way. Not many do.

Graphically the game is stunning to look at. With my specs I have it running on I believe its called ""very high"". Game looks beautiful and I do not have a single complaint regarding a low frame count....as far as frames per second -- game runs smooth as glass.

The weapon assortment in this game was disappointing to me.... nothing really unique or special when put up against other FPS games. Also there's not a lot of different weapons (at least none that my character saw) - the game is very ""average"" in this area.

So what didn't I like the most about this game....3 things irritate me to no end with this game.

1) There are several areas in the game its very glitchy or it just out right crashes me to Windows desktop. I still played through the chapters (I basically just restarted the area or the chapter and then tried a slightly different path to walk / move in then where I remembered it would crash or glitch on me)

2) One thing that is a peeve of my in many games but especially in FPS games....is when the developer over uses a game mechanic too much. I can not stand the amount of ""trudging through swamp / water"" areas in this game. Now maybe it was because I found I crashed a few times in these areas ... but it got to the point where I was literally thinking ""Seriously guys...this .... AGAIN?!"". What's worse about it is there's a mechanic if you fall into the water you literally can't do anything at all to save your self from getting eaten. It other words its just a scripted death event you have no control over. (You thought I'd say the darkness thing huh? ...nope...while the game uses ""darkness"" more than anything else .... I don't find it a gripe because thats integrated into the story and it makes sense being that its post nucelar war / and a lot of the game is under ground....)

3) Environment is mostly eye candy , and though it looks absolutely gorgeous in this game....this game doesn't really let you have all that much freedom of movement you feel , or at least I did, like many times your character is on rails. Even though graphically you may see say a hill or a pile of junk cars or whatever not far....and you think ""hmm the baddies are coming ...that hill would be a good vantage point...or good cover..."" NOPE. Want to talk about immersion killing...yeah nothing does it better for me than when my character is supposed to be an elite Ranger....but he doesn't know how to climb a 3 foot high mound of trash...or he can't take what looks to be another path right next to him...

All in all despite the crashes and my pet peeves....believe it or not I did enjoy this game over all. When everything is going good some of the chapters are just incredible fun.

On a 1-100 scale I'd give this game an 85%. (5% deducted for ""ride on rails, environment is just eye candy and hey let's over use the every loving crap out of this water mechanic"" and 10% deducted because of the random glitches and crashes)",1400419317,1400419912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Metro has become another ""shoot all the bullets!"" FPS, sneaking was slow and unrewarding (when the game ACTUALLY allows it) most of last light consists of forced combat where you wait and kill things on a timer until whatever you are waiting on arrives or finishes its job.

The story is garbage and makes very little sense, much of it contradicts the first game, it reminds me a little of Bioshock infinite, in that it tries WAY too hard to be something more than it really is.

It is a visually pretty game, the weapons are cool and fun to use, modding them is fairly nice as well.

This game has always challenged me in its well designed stealth levels, and has maintained its balance between full-on FPS and an RPG style survival with plenty of side-stories. In fact, the Metro (the main underground system where the inhabitants have settled upon) is full of personal stories you can eavesdrop on- these little details make this apocalyptic world a real joy to play in.

Character developments are fantastically done in Last Light. As the story progresses, you feel more as though you are in the protagonist's shoes. Unlike other games where the gameplay takes priority over the story, Metro intigrates the story and the gameplay into one forged entity. It is a hard feat to accomplish, but Metro Last Light has done it flawlessly, and I applaud them for doing so.

The game utilises its environments well to keep you on the edge of your seat. I especially loved the levels where you are alone in the dark tunnels of the Metro, and all you can hear is the harsh, heavy breathing in your gas mask and the devilishly eerie sounds that echo around you. You are constantly looking behind your shoulders, alert and ready for anything that will strike you from the darkness. But the real fear is of the unknown, and it is really emphasized in this game.

The graphics are yet again one of the most punishing and beautiful out there, but its lower settings have been optimized for lower-end PCs, so for all you budget gamers out there- don't panic if you have a shoddy GPU, because i've played through the whole game without any trouble on my integrated Intel HD 4000.

To sum up, I can say for sure that no game has ever made me play for so long without the desire to sleep. I've spent hours playing this game all the way past midnight, even though on most horror games I tend to steer clear of playing at night. This game is the perfect equilibrium between storytelling excellence and survival-FPS action.

This is what I was thinking all the time while playing Metro: Last Light. This, and a lot of other things. Metro: Last Light is a game about humanity, about how it struggles to survive, and about how it thinks while doing so. Artyom, by being a ranger, has an enviable overlook on every event, and when we look at his words in the notes we know what is really happening.

As an FPS, this game is incredibly well designed, alternating fast-paced fights against monsters to stealth (or not) sections with humans. Everything takes place inside the dark, creepy spaces of the Metro or in the plain, radioactive light of the surface. How you want to survive, using a wide range of weapons or a simple knife… it’s only up to you.

Technically it’s gorgeous: both graphic and audio quality are very high; so far, this was the only game able to really stress my dual-GPU rig.

DLCs are also very good, especially The Chronicles Pack, which expands the plot adding new thrilling chapters.

The story again lived up to my expectations, they scenary and the world was better then before, as was the cutscenes and animations.

 the Gameplay was similar to the first but has had some major revamps and is a lot more entertaining, particularly the stealth. A lot more weapons have been added as well as customization. my favourite addition to arsenal was the powerful rifles. A few new monsters have also appeared which gave a thbe game a new bang. i honestly don't have any negatives to this game, i found no glitches and there was nothing that i looked at and thought ""well that sucks"". One thing i noted however was that you fight more humans then monsters compared to the first one but that didn't really bother me.

It was ok, but overall I felt like dismissing it for being a fairly generic corridor shooter.  Not a fan of melee monsters rushing at you.  The overall quality, VO and graphics felt hokey and a bit amateurish. I prefered the Stalker series. So, when the new metro game out, i didn't rush to buy it.

So, fast forward, finally got Last Light on sale and had the time to play it. WHOA! Did it ever exceed my expectations.  Still a bit of a corridor shooter (duh! its in the metro) but the levels were abosolutely beautifully designed this time around. FYI I played it on max settings, so your milage may vary.  The gameplay is fun overall, especially the encounters with humans. I played on Hardcore and only dropped it for bosses.  Stealth is a bit overpowered IMO, especially the throwing knifes. They one shot kill almost everything, so as long as you stay in the shadows you pretty much sweep the field without firing a single round.  

Now, for the weaker points.  The plot is well told and interesting, although there are some annoying parts. Not sure if its due to the source material since i haven't read the books.  The whole facists and communists a century after WW2 AND in russia stretchs credibility and comes across as lazy writing to find some easy villians to hate. You'd think people would be a tad suspicious.  Other than that, I did encounter several bugs, months after release. Shouldn't be happening.

Metro 2033 was a great game.  Last Light is even better, due to a more polished game engine that makes the gun and physics much more enjoyable. 

Its necessary to play both games to truly understand and appreciate the storyline.  I played them both back to back.  I highly recommend not reading any spoilers or walkthroughs for these games.  

Metro Last Light filter mechanic has been greatly improved over 2033's, masks and filters are more abundant, can be salvaged from the dead and the environment more consistently.

Metro Last Light's guns operate much better than Metro 2033.

Last Light looks amazing.  Storyline trumps graphics for me, but Last Light's visuals will astonish you.

There are collectible journal entries found on the levels.  I'd recommend not looking up a walkthrough to find these on a first play through because it likely will ruin the plot.  Collect them on a second playthrough.

Very important: if you play Metro 2033, buy as many air filters as possible.  You won't be able to buy filters later.  In Last Light, this is not as much a concern.

You play as Artyom a key person in shaping the events of this world and thanks to moral choices you will face within the game you will shape events to come. The game is beautifully realised, the attention to environmental detail is fantastic, it's almost a shame that so much of it is played in the dark. The game play is smooth and there are some RPG lite elements in terms of gun crafting and upgrading. I would have liked this to be expanded upon. I think a key area where this game falls short is the story can seem confusing and a little convoluted at times, It took me a while to piece together what was actually going on. Artyoms Journal which you find throughout the game helps elaborate on events but I personally find looking for and reading notes can often become a chore breaking thee rhythm of play. Still it's only a minor gripe.

Aspects of the game easily fall into the horror/survival genre, as well as staying true to the FPs tradition. Stealth has also been encorporated well into the game, becoming a major part of gameplay. You can choose to go in guns blazing, or sneak around with throwing knives in the shadows of the metro. This gives the game a bit of replay value as you can go back and decide to handle certain levels differently.

Ok, so I'm exaggerating on the scale, but it's still much better than the first one (though I recommend you play the first one first to fully appreciate it).  The character models are far more detailed than in 2033, and the weapon customization is absolutely amazing.  I miss the options of armor back in 2033 (when the options were available), but the sheer choices of firepower and the add-ons you can throw on them now more than makes up for it.

One of the best parts, though, is the updated Ranger Mode.  I couldn't really tell the difference between normal and Ranger mode on the prequel, but here?  VERY NOTICABLE, to say the least.  Ammo reduction, holding Tab to check your supplies brings up the throwing weapons and /maybe/ the filter count without the time, and Ranger Hardcore shows almost NOTHING in that 'window'.  It forces you to work on audio cues alone when using throwing weapons and filters, and the ammo limitations (along with the inability to see how much ammo you have left) makes you use guns you know hold very few rounds or are at least easier to manage than other guns.

Now, I agree that making you pay for the Ranger Mode was kind of a jerk-move, but with the Complete Edition out now, THERE IS NO EXCUSE ANYMORE!!!  BUY THIS GAME, THE METRO IS CALLING!!!!!",1398535091,1398535091,True,3,0,0.539295375347137451,0,True,False,False

This game is those kinds of games were you can not really go in with guns blazing on higher difficulty and instead have to rely on stealth. I would recommend this all the time becouse it makes the game alot easier in my opinion. It also keeps you always on your toes since you for exampel have to check your ilters in your gasmask when venturing to dangerous areas and keep your lamp recharged.

The only bad thing I can come up with is that reflecting on the prequel, Metro 2033, Metro Last Light kinda lost abit of the creepy feeling the prequel gave. In Metro 2033 you felt more alone, when you absolutley wouldnt want to be alone.

43160,9925242,76561198069334903,0,16,1110,0,950,1465269289,"Pros
- Beautiful Visuals
- Combat Variation (stealth or rambo)
- Interesting Mechanics Regarding Non-Weapon Equipment (Gas masks, air filters, lighters, etc)
- Great Story
- Choices that affect the story
- Tense Fights 

Cons 
- Very dull color palete (mostly greys and browns)
- 95% Linear Gameplay (IE miminal exploration, though players are given choices that affect the outcome of the story as well as a couple of small hubs to walk around)
- Mute Main Character (This boils down to preference, personally I'm not much of a fan)
- Bare Minimum Graphics Menu for Linux Players (One Option - Quality Bar)

If there was any doubt that a benchmark game can be fun as well as provide jawdropping visuals than I guess Metro Last Light showed me that such feats were possible.  Pictures and YouTube videos don't exactly do it justice, and visually its one of those things better experienced first hand.  With that said, even though you can understand the lack of color given the games setting, it does start to feel  a little dreary as the game goes on.  

The games plot does an excellent job of providing an engaging story inciting numerous emotions along the way.  The combat provides enough openess where, at least with human enemies, you can choose to employ stealth tactics or go in guns a blazing.  Personally I found that the game seemed to reward me for using stealth tactics when they were made available.  The fights with non-humans are tense and do a decent job of providing scares.  Though if you're looking for something on par with Amnesia or Outlast in the horror department safe to say you won't find it here.  

As for cons, depending on your preference having Artyom as a mute during gameplay might serve as a detriment.  Personally I found it confusing as he narrates the mission summaries that are shown during loading screens.  As a result there were many times were I wanted to have Artyom react more directly with the plot.  To be fair though the mute main character isn't handled nearly as poorly as most other games that employ it. 

The main structure of the game of the game is extremely linear.  There is very little exploration made avaialble to the players.  Save for things like an option to either ignore a pack of animals simply protecting their turf or going in and getting resources off the bodies of their victims.  There are also one or two stations where you get to walk around for a bit and explore but these are few and far between.

  With that said there are more than a few choices made available for the player to affect the storyline, and ultimately the ending which will provide you with one of two variations based on your decisions.  Some decisions are spelled out for you, other decisions are similar to Dishonered where how you actually play affects the final outcome.  Personally I didn't mind the overall linear nature especially since along the way I was given choices to affect the story, which is really how any linear game should be handled.  

Also at times, while the voice acting isn't at all bad, the accents do a feel a little over the top at times.  I guess that was the balance they had to strike making it so English players could understand the dialog while helping them believe that the people were in fact Russian.  

Turns out though there is a Russian dialog option,  just be warned that you must select it before jumping into actual gameplay.  A nice change of pace for the most part, only draw back to the Russian dialog option is the subtitles can be kind of long at times so you spend a little more time than you'd like reading rather than going back and forth between the subs and the environment.  Also a lot of background conversations aren't subbed so you might miss a couple of supplemental details that give you an idea of what life is like in the metro.    

Other Notes
- One small gripe I had with the game was that the volume keys on my keyboard were rendered moot.  Though with Last Light I played with Turtle Beach Headphones I usually am far away from the volume knobs on my regular speakers, so if you have an unconventional setup like me where you play on a traditional TV but use computer speakers just know that you're kind of set with whatever system volume level you select when booting the game up.  

You can alt+tab out to change it, and it seems to work fine now, but a couple of months ago there were times when the game would crash if I went back to my desktop while running the game.  Though as of writing this review that is not the case as I'm at least able to freely move back and forth with alt+tab.

- If you're playing on Linux just know that the graphic settings are extremely limited.  Essentially you're only given one option which is a quality bar.  Other features such as AA options, motion blur, etc are currently exclusive to the Windows version.  I tried it out just because I'm studying Linux and I'm interested in Valve's approach to the Linux OS but suffice to say that the Windows version ran a lot better.  Weather or not that was a product of the Linux drivers, the code provided by Deep Silver, or something else entirely I can't say for sure.  

Really my only goal was to get it working and see what it was like to play a AAA game on Linux.  To be fair this was a couple of months ago so maybe its changed since then but as I said it was really more of a ""lets see if I can get it to run experiment.""",1398397363,1398403152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have a capable machine, it is one of the best looking PC Games to date. Despite the gorgeous graphics in the game, it does a good job of taking the continued story from the first game and tying it into the awesome shooting mechanics, creepy atmosphere, and seemingly supernatural phenomena that happens throughout the game. A great part of this game's shooting sequences is that it completely allows you to go stealth, loud, or be an in-between ninja, it's a really good way of handling combat in my opinion. I still think anyone who has no knowledge of the first game could still enjoy the game, both story-wise and gameplay-wise. Overall, it is a game that deserves your immersion no matter how deep you are able to go, and it's just generally a great shooter.

MLL improves upon it's predecessor in almost every way, from gun mechanics to the story. It's also one of the most immersive games to date, while playing it you'll find yourself tense and jumping at loud noises while out in the tunnels of the Metro or exploring the radiation covered surface of post apocylptic Moscow. Stations with survivors making do are spotted all over the Metro and as the game progresses you'll find yourself exposed to a range of situations from dangerous Russian NAZIs chasing you to stalking through the Reds (Soviets) territory. 

Another great improvement is the graphics, with a dark gritty look MLL looks exactly like how you'd expect a post apoclyptic world to be. Firing your gun is extremely satisfying and the guns are drastically different from one another with cool 'improvised' designs to look like they were made from 2nd hand 'dirty' material. 

Voice acting is up for debate, personally Russian voice with english subs is the way to go if you want to trult immersive yourselves. The Russian language is suited for this game and while the English voice acting is good it's not as good as it should be.

Im going to start some time back tho, to give a better understanding about how Metro: Last Light is one of the best games i played in many years.
I've loved S.T.A.L.K.E.R. because of its unique dark and unsettling atmosphere, and been a fan of the franchise from the first game onward. I heard of Metro 2033 some time before i could actually play it, and it sounded alot like what i knew from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 
When i finally got to play it, i was torn between loving and hating it for almost the same reasons as once S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
Some parts of the game were unneccessarily hard, and also mostly badly programmed, in regards to the AI mainly. Still, it was a great game with a seemingly living, breathing world, ironically after a nuclear holocaust. especially the different settlements in the metro stations seemed to be very alife, thanks to the hard work that was put into the many details to create the perfect illusion of the underground metro life. In that regard it was much superior to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, especially thanks to the highly improved animation quality and interactions between NPC's and the player character.
When i finished the game, i was pretty sure that i would play the sequel as well, but i waited till it was in a steam sale, because some of the gameplay flaws of the original game didn't leave me unscathed, and i was unsure if the sequel would be better and worth the purchase.
When i finally got to play it i was actually stunned, and in all means positively. The presentation even got better in comparisson to the first game, which wasn't a really easy to achieve thing, given that the Metro 2033 already was great at that. There is even more interaction between the player and his surroundings, be it NPC's or simply the environment.
Graphic-wise, the game looks absolutely gorgeous, to say the least. The engine perfetly displays the dark atmosphere in a way i havent seen been done like this yet. Secondy, the Gameplay related flaws of the first game that i noticed seemed to be gone completely, and with that i mean the AI in both combat and stealth situations. While sometimes in the prequel, the NPC's would suddenly all know where i am, even though they never had direct line of sight, they behave much more realistic in Last Light, thats atleast what i experienced in my playthrough. I don't know how much the experience might differ in regards to the difficulty setting tho, since i only played it on 'easy'. Because i remembered some of the overly hard passages in the original game on 'normal' difficulty. The last point goes to the Story, even though it seems a little strange to me as a followup to the prequel (I mean the relationship of the player character with the so called 'Dark Ones'), the actual Story pulled me my in the game much more than the first game did, by successfully using flashbacks to induce emotions like remorse and compassion with fictional characters.
In my personal opinion, Last Light a great sequel, and in many ways superior to the first game.
I can give the game a 10/10 without a doubt, and would highly recommend the game not only to the people who played the first game, but also to anyone who generally likes post apocalyptic or survival horror-themed games.",1397710831,1397710831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On top of that, you've got some very interesting and dynamic combat situations, in which it's often a good idea to make use of the game's delightful stealth mechanics - seriously, there's nothing more satisfying than silently clearing out a Nazi encampment  with nothing but some throwing knives and a silenced pistol - and fairly engaging cinematic presentation.

The game is not stable, and it uses a checkpoint save system, so crashing, corrupting and having to completely restart a mission is a possibility with every save.

The game itself is a succesful update on the original. Design and gameplay are sleeker and have a more contemporary feel, and the graphics are truly stunning, even if it does stumble a bit here and there. A few protracted cutscenes, inconsistent AI, on-rails sections that have you leaving the car every 30 seconds, and NPC dialogue triggering at odd times being among the most notable.

Even so, there are a lot more ""ooos"" than ""mehs"" along the way, and much like Darksiders 2, playing it made me sad that THQ went the way they did.

Just like THQ though, Deep Silver weren't able to finish the game either. 5 hours into it, I have a random crash, and my save goes the way of so many Reichs, Reds and nosalists.

It is very refreshing to see a game, especial as graphically good as this one, that is so well made that it runs on Normal settings on a 2 year old computer. Quick note to other ATI users, at time it would be super slow on some levels, to the point where it was unplayable. All you need to do is turn off PhysX, it is nVidia feature and sometimes can make ATI cards not handle the game. If you want, turn it back on after that certain level, but I left it off throughout the game.

I really enjoyed it as it is more focused on a human element than Metro 2033. I enjoyed Metro 2033 and beat the game with both endings, but at times it was a little depressing to keep walking through dark tunnels shooting monsters.

I chose stealth mode for Last Light and knocked everyone out, even if I didn't have to, just so I can explore the whole area. The story is very strong and it is fun to play. I am thinking about going through it again to get the bad ending, to see what it's all about.

Definitely would recommend, especially if you catch it on a huge 75% sale like I did. Now I am waiting for another sale like that to buy all DLCs.

One more quick thing. I was happy to see the addition of a Mac version, although I have not tried it as recommended specs look way higher than PC equivalent.",1397319259,1397330388,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A continuation of Metro 2033, Last Light continues the story of Artyom. This game picks up right where 2033 left off. I definitely see why people recommend playing 2033 before Last Light, If I had not, I would not have been able to follow what was going on as well. So I'll recommend the same. 

This game is simply amazing! Very well put together, no drastic changes to the controls from 2033 to this game so it was a smooth transiton from one game to the next. The developers tweaked the controls a bit to make them more streamlined, and it did help quite a bit with weapoon switching and when using throwable weapons like granades and such. Very well done on their part. Other than the slight changes, it still has the same feel as 2033 does, basically just a little easier on the gamer.

Once again, I must commend the graphics! This game is simply stunning to see! At times it almost makes you feel like you are actually there! The textures, lighting, it is all beyond great. This game puts every other recent game I have played to shame. Nothing even comes close! As a comparison, Assassin's Creed 4 isn't even as good as this. These visuals come at a price though. This game is quite demanding, especially at it's highest settings, which is where I ran it. My rig (Detailed in my Steam profile) had no problems running it maxed out at 1080P, but she did get pretty warm. It was actually working my system out a bit, something not many games can accomplish. It seems to run a good loading balance between the CPU and GPU. A fairly powerful all around rig is needed to run it maxed out. As an example, to run this game on very high settings, a minimum of a Radeon HD 7870 XT (or Nvidia equivilent) will be needed, which I do not doubt at all. Just make sure you can run it before buying it, nothing's worse than buying a game to run it on low settings! Although even on medium it is still probably very nice looking! (By the way, anybody running this game on an AMD card, be sure to turn off advanced PhysX in the game play menu or the game will stutter and be very slow at times. Even Lower end Nvidia cards have a hard time running the advanced PhysX.)

Overall, I highly recommend this game. It is the very best Shooter game I have ever played. Has stunning visuals, and a very cool and detailed story. I really do hope they come out with another Metro game. If they do, I will definitely buy it!",1396927288,1397010144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

	4 years ago, Ukraine based developer [i]4A Games[/i] released [i]Metro 2033[/i], pleasantly surprising many gamers and critics with the richly eloquent and immersive ambience of the [i]Metro[/i] experience. While the game was far from perfect, the community nonetheless basked in the distinct Russian flavour of the setting, characters, and outlook represented in its post-apocalyptic world, passionately adapted from [i]Dmitry Glukhovsky’s[/i] novel of the same title.

	In [i]Metro[/i], the metaphorical strife of humanity against its darker, self-destructive nature were often presented in true, unyielding gritty terms. Depictions of huddled humanity striving against the desolation of the new world, not for survival but for the basic sense of normality and security were disturbingly overlaid with images of violent fanaticism and unforgiving death. Death by the creatures of the new world and by left and right winged fanatics.

	As a highly cinematic game, based on a series of novels, [i]Metro: Last Light's[/i] meat is in the story. Almost the entirety of my commendation for this franchise originates from the story-driven experience, so discussing the way in which the story is told seems like the most appropriate place to start. The game prioritizes on the human experience as the lead method of story telling, making it a unique and enriching experience. From the very beginning in which the series’ protagonist, Artyom, awakens to his call to adventure, it is abundantly clear that an intricate level of attention has been dedicated to detail that could only hope to be achieved by a group of developers with a genuine love for their subject matter. Extremely excessive yet altogether human interactions, like the ability to play your musical instruments, or turn off the room lights before moving out, build a sense of empathy by allowing the player to project very normal impulses onto the first person perspective. Every time you find yourself in a surviving human settlement, there are a myriad of opportunity to take a break from the violent chaos of the unforgiving new world and listen to the personal stories and woes of the Metro survivors; All told in richly voiced and detailed animated discussions. These little things add depth and immersion to [i]Metro: Last Light[/i], all the while giving an insight of the life in the Metro. Even when you are out on your own traversing the wastelands, the bulk of the game’s survival mechanics are built around an immersive sense of physicality. For example, players will need to manually replace their gas mask filters, charging their kinetic powered torch light by using a pump and wipe dirt and mud from their visor.

	The rich and detailed story is well accompanied by the breathtaking beauty of the game's graphics engine and art. The level of gaming design provides an ultra-realistic environment gives the player the added advantage of situational awareness. For example, tracking enemy numbers and movement by merely observing the shadows cast on the walls. Players will be able to traverse the underground Metro stations, both surviving human settlements and settlements which did not survive an attack by the creatures of the new world. Players will also be able to witness the quaint, post-apocalyptic beauty of the nuclear wasteland of what once was Moscow, the Red Square and Saint Basil's Cathedral.

	The gameplay is fairly straight forward and linear. The linearity of the game is well executed as it stays focussed on the story and tasks at hand, not deviating too much from the imperative nature of Artyom's mission. However, the game does allow room for exploration and rewards you for doing so. Such rewards include ammo, gas mask filters, and even new weapons. The combat system is very interesting because you are given a choice in play style. One way to play it is like a typical modern shooter with guns blazing. A ton of arsenal is still at your disposal. From the pre-apocalypse Kalashnikov rifles, to Metro engineered shotguns and submachine guns. The game also allows weapons customization like adding silencers, laser sights and weapons optics. However, it should be noted that ammo is very scarce in the Metro, so tactical approaches to any combat situations are a must, adding another level of realism into the game. Another way to play it is by sticking to the shadows like a ghost as you pass through enemy settlements. This is the way I recommend playing the game because it will grant you more instances to stop and listen to the characters' stories and gain further insights to life in the Metro. It will grant you a heightened sense of satisfaction and accomplishment at the end of your journey, should you choose to play it this way. However, there will be instances where you cannot sneak past the enemies, but this is where it gets interesting, because you are given to choice to either slit the enemy's throat or just knock him out. Do you think there is already enough death and suffering in the Metro? Or do you think the wicked should be cleansed from the new world? The choice is entirely up to the player.

	[i]Metro: Last Light[/i] possesses a wealth of passion for its subject matter that is promising for the future of [i]4A Games[/i]. Playing it is like reading a book, written in the first person, where the author uses incredible and poetic descriptive language for every little thing that the protagonist encounters. In a world that is filled with misery and death, it is up to the player to decide if Artyom should add more misery and death to the world, or to salvage the last remnants of good in the wreckage of humanity. [i]Metro: Last Light[/i] does not want players to just enjoy the combat (or stealth), but also to learn something, to feel something out of it. What you ask? I think it wants us to question the human condition and ponder about the value and meaning of our lives before we inevitably succumb to our destructive nature.",1396673175,1396718878,True,589,3,0.895325422286987305,21,True,False,False

A word of advice, Turn of physX in game settings if your game is laggin

The story line was quite good, I very much enjoyed playing through this universe again in there second instalment. The story line did feel quite dark (and slightly irratating  at some points seen as I got the good ending in the first ;p)

A lot of stealth in this game too. that's a lot of fun sneaking about and attempting to kill everyone without making much noise. I also really liked that I could just knock peaple out. I went through the first half of the game just doing that when I could.

I played through it over the course of one day just because I wanted to see where I would go next. As for gameplay, the gunplay is satisfying and the ai is very competent for the most part. The human enemies are less bullet spongy and stealth is more functional than in 2033. Weapon upgrades and some minor control tweaks are also a welcome addition.

The bad: Last Light focuses more on the dealings of people than 2033 did and because of this the sort of immersive horror experience I remember from the first one is lacking. The story is also lacking and the characters aren't very well developed or interesting. There are a lot of missed opportunities to expand on the setting, atmosphere, and level of immersion because of this. The misguided displays of sexuality (boobs) aren't very welcome either since they are not handled well and feel out of place. As for gameplay, the 'shine your light on the monsters to kill them' segments aren't very enjoyable. Also filters do not seem to last a set time as they did in 2033. Now they appear to last as long as the designers wanted them to in individual situations to control gameplay. I found it frustrating that at certain times I would have lots of time and at others they would burn up rapidly without any explanation as to why.  

The ugly: At one point I encountered a bug that required me to load a checkpoint and play through a very short segment nearly twenty times before a scripted event triggered properly and allowed me to continue.

In relation to the novel: As a sequel Last Light takes things in a slightly different direction than 2033 and tries to blend the game world with the novel a bit more which leaves it somewhere in the middle. It's certainly debatable whether or not they did a good job of this and my opinion is a bit mixed. Some things were handled well while others where not. People who have read 2033 may enjoy elements of this while those who have only played the game may be a bit confused by it. If you want to get the most out of the setting presented in this game and have not read Metro: 2033 first I would recommend doing so.

Final Verdict: If you want a unique fps experience and enjoy dark atmospheric games this is well worth playing. If you haven't played 2033 I recommend that you start there as it is a better game as a whole. If you have played 2033 and enjoyed it this is a satisfying trip back into it's world but does feel a bit disconnected in some ways.",1396632286,1396632286,True,1,0,0.503058075904846191,0,True,False,False

Word of advice, the stealth mechanics are overpowered (enemies hardly see you) so unless you're having a hard time, i recommend going full-rambo.

Total lenght is around 10hs and there isn't much replayability, but the game provides a quality experience that will stick to you more than your average cod game.

43160,9711533,76561197996696632,0,2,776,0,776,1396413461,"The main draw for this game is how immersive it is, which is accomplished through some clever uses of the first person perspective, such as wiping blood or rain off your mask; as well as great ambient sound design.  Assuming you have a decent PC, the game is one of the best looking games out there.

Gameplay wise, it is feels much more polished than the prequel.  There is now more of a stealth system in place, including more stealth routes throughout the levels.  The system itself is pretty basic and just depends on whether or not you're visible, which is indicated by a light on your wrist.  As you sneak around, you can choose to knock out or kill dudes, which is tied to the game's morality system.  The shooting sections, as well as the gun upgrade system, felt pretty much unchanged, which isn't a bad thing, but I wouldn't say that the shooting in the game is what makes it worth playing either.  The morality system is also pretty simple, essentialy you get ""good"" points by not killing people and by helping people you may find in each level and town section.  These points can also be earned by listening to NPC conversations, some of which can be annoyingly long if you're trying to get the good ending.

Generally, I found that the stealth became repetitive near the end, which probably wasn't helped by me needing to retry some sections.  The shooting to me wasn't really enjoyable.  Usually when I did it, it was when fighting mutants, since I was going for the good ending and I had to stealth around people.  Maybe its more fun when fighting people, but with the mutants when they attack they get right up in your face, which is fine except that the camera jerks pretty violently after each hit, which to me was more frustrating than immersive.  However, there are some interesting levels that are pretty awesome, such as getting to drive a ""go kart"" mine cart and explore a bunch of side routes throught out the tunnels in one section.

Story wise, its okay.  There were a bunch of things I didn't really care for.  The best part was this one character that you meet at some point.  The character had an interesting story arc, which I wish was focused on more, rather than this ""grand scheme"" sort of story that was settled on.

Overall, I would recommend the game mostly due to how atmospheric it is, which I think is worth experiencing.  However, if you don't care about that then you could probably skip it.",1396507977,1396507977,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Interestingly, Last Light is not a result of an adaptation - the story takes place in the same universe as its predecessor but it was not the sequel (titled Metro 2034) the Ukrainian developer team adapted. Rumor has it that the upcoming book Metro 2035 may be the adaptation of Last Light as the author of the books worked closely with the developer team. 

Artyom obtained fame after the ending of Metro 2033 - the game follows its ""bad"" ending and Artyom is now a recognised ranger in D6. As supplies are running short the rangers are trying to come up with a plan to find more, in the meantime, the two opposing factions are getting more and more desperate in their attempt to overthrow one another. 

You play Artyom again and everything you loved (or hated) in the prequel returns: anomalies, stealth-based approach in certain missions, an array of weapons that can use your ""currency"" as stronger ammunition, Khan, nosalises, pneumatic gun, shotgun with suppressor etc. So what exactly has changed gameplay-wise? Well, you now have the option to take down enemies with a knife not just by throwing them. In fact, you can use its hilt to apply blunt force and silently take out your enemies. This actually counts toward achievements as the game rewards you for not killing people on certain levels. It was a nice addition to the game; something that I missed a lot in the first one. Oh, as for weapons: there do not come pre-modded but it is you who can purchased any mod you desire. Also, Artyom's filter and watch both seem to be operating much better and not being a nuisance.

The 4A Engine still looks good and to be honest I found this game more optimised than its predecessor. After Last Light I reinstalled Metro 2033 only to find it running much slower than its sequel. Not allowing you to fully customise the graphics from the options menu is still an issue but at least you can do some minor tampering instead of just picking a pre-determined set of settings.

Unfortunately, Last Light could not be an exception to the growing world of DLCs. The game saw the release of 4 DLC packs not to mention that the Ranger mode itself is also a purchasable add-on. The Developer and Tower Pack DLCs are OK but what you definitely need to pick up are the Chronicles and Faction Pack with their missions and the former giving you some extra details on the game's plot.

I liked Metro Last Light. I liked it a lot. I felt a much greater tension now in the world of Metro as Artyom is put in between two faction waging war against each other.

I was not disappointed. It's a good mix of shooter and stealth, with open areas and dark tunnels and the lack of help means you get to play your way, not the way some programmer wants you to play.

Thanks to my experience, I finished Ranger Hardcore with my second playthrough. Nonetheless, Last Light still offers the goodies you'll expect, with its own ups and downs.

Out of any post-apocalyptic games out there, last light has the most atmospheric environment. It's just so immersive and visually breath-taking. From the claustrophobic tunnels of Metro to the ravage wasteland of Moscow, last light pulls off a incredibly detailed environment. The swampy wasteland is such an improvement from the icy outskirts from 2033, and offers more exotic and dangerous feeling. Also, the existence of paranormal events helps develop a greater immersion and mysterious aura that surrounds the entire setting of the game. The game, while not really scary nor fully commits to be a survival horror, has some pretty creepy moments, back-up with great atmosphere. Funny how a lot of games out there (often AAA) that claims to be a horror game doesn't even come close to metro last light in terms of disorienting atmosphere, the most important aspect of a horror game.

Its not just the tunnels and surface of the Moscow that here, you'll also have the human camps on the Metro tunnels where you can explore their little but incredibly detailed surroundings, go buy stuffs, exchange ammos and even listen to conversations of the people around and uncover insteresting stories or even important plot points. The music and sound design for this game is also well done and it helps overall immersion.

The monster encounters in last light are still on par with that of 2033 in quality. You have the standard nosalises and demons. Sadly, the excellent lurkers of 2033 and their annoying and yet effective shenanigans, as well as the nasty librarians (though appears in DLC) are gone here. But they got replaced by the spiderbugs, which also quite simple but awesome, not to mention there makes creepy a** moments with their lair and the sounds they make. And since most of Moscow is covered with swamp, you got some pretty new and annoying enemies, in the form of shrimps. Last light seem to have more monster encounters than 2033 or at least more emphasis on it, which is good as they offer a lot more stronger challenge that human enemies.

Speaking of humans, one of the most notable improvements in last light is the fact that there is now a proper stealth mechanic, unlike the notoriously broken stealth and one of the deepest flaws of 2033. You can now takedown enemies, either killing them or knocking them out, and actual hiding is now made easier. There is also an incidator which tells if you're visible or not, and one big plus is that you can actually go hide again once detected, something that is so stupidly broken on 2033. However, that isn't saying it's actual quality. Enemies here are almost blind even when you're of couple of meters away from them, just as long as the indicator says you're ""not visible"", and results in some pretty funny (and sometimes downright stupid) experiences. Not only that, they have poor awareness (not even realising others getting killed) and broken hearing. They are poorly programmed to seemingly ""hear"" you if you sprint near them, even if there is a very loud motor nearby, while they can't even hear their buddy's death grunt from a few meters. This makes every human encounter a piece of cake, specially on ranger difficulty.

Guns in last light are now customisable which is another plus, with better set of guns. The controls are now better as certain actions are now easier to manage, like selecting through throwable items. General gunplay here, however, are somewhat less appealing. The hitmarkers replaced the awesome red flash from 2033. That red flash whenever Artyom is hit is very disorienting and are an excellent design choice. The hitmarkers here, while they can cause distraction, are lame compared to it. There are also less hindrance in shooting. The firing flashes and the gun smokes that makes targeting and firing in 2033 harder are less and sometimes non-existent in here. The enemies, while it's good that they are not too dead-on accurate like in 2033, are pretty lame in shooting. Combined altogether, this makes open gunfights in last light more of nimble rambo-ing around enemies than the refined careful approach on 2033, even with your ammo supply on consideration. Last light approaches a path towards generic FPS shooting and I hope that if there will be a next installment, they would refine it towards what they started on 2033.

As you may have noticed, a difficulty level is sold seperately as a DLC. Remenber back then where people are laughing about how it funny it would be if difficulty became DLC? Guess what? It's happening! And while I brought the ranger mode, it's only because of the massive (And I mean VERY Massive) discount that I dont think benefited the devs that much. Unfortunately, while the ranger easy is fine, the ranger hardcore is broken due to one reason: the entire HUD is gone... Literally! Now the lack of magazine indicator and the crosshair is fine but you almost cannot know what ammo are you using and how much ammo you have left on the fly! This was same in 2033 and wasn't fixed in last light. This is NOT realistic and I can't stress that enough. A human, let alone a ranger can easily check his gears before or after the battle in preperation, specially in a post apocalyptic world where danger is around every corner. At least give me a way to check my stuff, maybe a peek button or something to make Artyom take a peek at his magazine to see of it's what kind of ammo he's using or how much he's carrying, but leaves him vulnerable so he can't use it mid-battle. That would have been a smart design. And if that is not crazy enough, guess what? The inventory is also missing, meaning to select your throwable item, you'll have to stop on listen to the cue sound of the item on the fly. And in mid battle where sound is all over the place, this is equivalent to basically blind picking your item. That is so wrong in so many levels.

For the story, there is nothing much worth noting about it. It does have a decent pacing and plot but some of the scenes can be cringeworthy in terms of delivery, specially when the way characters exchange lines together were not done well. Also, the last battle is not as climatic and intense as the last couple of missions in 2033 that involves the discovery of D6 and the race to the tower.

All and all, I'd still say that last light is better than 2033, by a very small margin, in that it offers an actual stealth mechanic and outskirts levels are more impressive. But they need to improve the stealth the began here, put less emphasis on fast paced gunplay and fix ranger hardcore (and actually sell it together with the game, GEEZ!).

I recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive single-player game, one that pays attention to detail and not just balls out action. Despite the negatives, the game still delivers a very enjoyable must have experience.

NOTE no matter weather it is windows or Linux you play this on it crashes. Two types of crashes, the first is it just shutting down back do your desktop. The other is locking up and totaly locking the graphics system. I really can not say the game is bad as it is pretty awesome, kind of brings back that whole feeling from Fear, half life and Doom put together.

Real shame this game is so unstable in that it just keeps crashing. If  you can stay away from this game then do so, it is a plague with your emotions as you really get into it and really enjoy the gameplay then it just screws with you and wont work. If the game was intended to troll you to suicide then that is exactly what it does.

I can NOT recomend this game at all on the above grounds but you never know, the developers may start actually pulling a finger out their ass and do something about the mess this game is creating. The longer they ignore the problem the bigger it is going to get.

That leads me on to the support! There is none! you cant get a single fix, update, help or assistance regarding this game no matter where you post just stupid things like. Have you got a powerfull enough graphics card? What seriously as if that would cause these kind of crashes, how could you even play half a level if the card was bad.
Is your graphics card overheating? i think i would experience these crashes allot more frequently with other games if it was.

Lots of things like that regarding it. So i gave up. The game is NOT ready for release it has not been played and played through to the max on systoms and beta tested to the edge of the earth and back again. Are we the beta testers? 

Either way it needs serious attention. I have every single graphics layer enabled on my systom apart from one. OpenVG is the layer i still not got built yet. everything from OpenGL to Wayland is built and running which healped greatly for several hours until i got to the gardens. 
seriously to think it is my computer or others computers to blame no matter of the OS who experience the same issues then it is the game. Something buggy resides in the game and as always closed source so can even look into it with any detail.

Other than all the above, its a great game or should i say great story and well layed out, graphics are good and the form of controls are creative and add a level of skilled fun.

Well to be honest? Its not all that different...same tunnels and dark areas...
While you do get the chance to explore and see more of the surfice world, this game really only adds things that would have helped stream lined the first one.

But if you enjoyed the first one you will enjoy this too. Its back...darker then ever...more dangerous then ever...

If only they would leave you alone in the tunnels more often? Rather then pinning a NPC with you majjority of the time.

Still i didnt regret this game. i enjoyed the well done lighting affects, and exploreing those dark old tunnels and buildings. 

you also get a few little new toys to use in doing so.

The immersion and atmosphere in this game is breath taking. I felt like I participated in a lot of ways in the world of metro, a living and breathing world. This is easily one of the prettiest games of 2013 on PC (I played it on Ultra High settings). Ukranian developers sure did prove that the FPS genre isn't just gunning down hords of faceless enemies and unlocking ""bad-ass warfare"" that makes you feel like a mini army. Personally, I rate this game a 9/10 (it would have been 10 if the ballancing on Ranger Hardcore mode was a bit better and for the linearity in general of the game).
Pros:
>Satisfying gunplay, customizable gear and upgrades
>Rich lore and great story (You need to play Metro 2033 in order to fully grasp it)
>Great companions with nice backgrounds (Khan, Pavel)
>Stunning visuals and tense horror scenes
>Great stealth
>Different approach to the FPS genre

Cons:
>Ammo is way to scarce on Ranger Hardcore mode (even with tons of exploration)
>Lack of hud in switch menu is annoying (When you want to switch from blades to grenades, molotovs etc)
>Boss battles can't be done with stealth (Like the rest of the game, you can even avoid beast fights)
>Few bugs here and there but nothing too much to ruin the feel of the game.

The story is written by dmitry glukhovsky based on the popular metro 2033 novel and that makes the game narrative as well as the background rich and engaging. The atmosphric music sends chill down my spine when i search pass through waste lands often filled with creepiness and horrific creatures lurking and seeking to kill everything on sight.

You are once again taking control of the main character of the first game Artyom and your mission is to find the last surviving dark ones and kill it. Things however, did not end so easily as other factions within the metro world took you on a journey filled with revenge, betrayal and war. It is there where your action matters and the last hope of humanity lies within your hands.

Metro: Last Light is definitely a improvement over metro 2033 with smoothness in gun play and less glitchy monster behaviours. The graphics is top notch with minor to none frame rate drop at the highest settings during the heat of battle. However, from time to time you may find that the overly done realisim may put in you dangerous situations.

The down side to the game is the fact that the only challenging mode the 'Ranger mode' was a DLC in which its content should been part of the game but nonetheless it is a great game without it as the replayability is high with collectible note book stating the event of the location and the history of the pre-apocalyse era. In addition to the main campaign, there are also side quests and extra chapter that will let you control other characters and see the story from their eyes adds an interesting element to the game.

I do recommend you to play the first game Metro 2033 before purchasing this because the story are interlinked with important choiced made before hand and everything else are perfectly done, I really recommend this to all fps, horror,survival game lovers it is a master piece. Oh, and for authentic feeling and purposes, you really should put on the russian dub setting with english subtitle it is just amazing.

Ahh Metro, the only franchise that seems willing to pick up where the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games left a sad void of unique single player campaigns in an irradiated russian world. 

Metro last light is an extremely successful sequel. It more or less picks up shortly after the ending of the first. 

The environments are beautiful. This is probably the best looking game i've ever played from a technical stand point and as soon as i turned off the game physx option, it ran damn near flawlessly on high settings. The level of detail in the ambience is impressive. Even in normal difficulty, there isn't a HUD so to speak, just your trusty watch. numbers flash showing your ammo, but there's no health bar. Beautiful water , blood, acid and other visual effects obscure your vision, even more so on your mask. the cool thing is there's now a key to wipe your mask clean, a brilliant idea that helps ad to the immersion as well as making things more realistic, visually. Sound is great. Story is good enough, and overall the level design has great pacing.

Sadly, they still can't or won't do hair correctly. To get by this, everyone is either shaved or has a butch hair do, even the ladies. It is the one thing that looks bad and it stands out because everything else is so well done. 

You spend some more time outside in this one, and it's spring time so its beautiful!!!!!!!! The lighting effects are astounding, and do factor in the gameplay immensely which is wonderful. Even outside, the game ran fantastic. 

Gameplay is exactly the same, but improved!  However, they added a new element of block buster'esque musical drama that feels over the top sometimes compared to the first game. 

Thing i liked most is that you don't get stuck in the first half of the game with crummy weapons. Fresh into the first hour or two, you'll have access to most things you'll ever need to play just like in the last one at peak stealth or pure combative. They are more or less the same weapons from the first game, with a few new.

The devs made a nice decision to keep a lot of the familiar sounds which gives the sequel a nice feeling of a true continuation of the first game. 

Overall, everything has been improved from a gameplay standard. You now loot bodies with one button instead of individual items on them. Your hand held electric generator takes about half the effort it used to, removing some needless clicking. You can swap filters on the fly and its a lot clearer when you need a mask or don't. I also have less instances of forgetting to take the mask off. Your hand held lighter plays a bigger role than the last game, and i found myself using it more for immersion. 

They took the same morality system as from the last game but gave you a bit more flexibility with it. Like in Dishonered, you can play the game without killing anyone if you can manage it. There's an achievement for that. You get plenty of knives and silencers early on so you can attempt to play without ever being spotted as soon as you want. 

cons
annoying intro that can't be skipped, plugging all the usual logos and crap

there's a store. god damn it, there's a store. it is actually a big chunky ol TV screen that takes up the most space in the main menu out of all the options. Very sad to see. brings up all this content that should have been in the game anyway. 

the knife sucks now. its really only good for assasination, not melee fighting up close. the animation, i hate it. its just that stab them in the back motion, every time you use it. 

some players might be confused what they are supposed to be doing, as metro chooses to let you figure things out even if you die 10 times doing it. i personally enjoy this gameplay mechanic but some might not.

Combat includes:
+Waiting for a timed event (a bridge raising, a boat arriving) while shooting mutants.

I adore the novel Metro 2033 and the game, which put much more stock in exploration and combat. Metro Last Light has less of the former and almost none of the latter. Expect to be treated to constant Blackouts as Artyom falls, is knocked out or something else, which got seriously old by Half-life 2. Expect constant QTE events as most areas involve hammering the E button as something UNEXPECTED! happens (oh no, another bridge collapsed) 

Metro Last Light is a dissapointment in terms of gameplay, and succeeds in some ways as an atmospheric story teller of a not so standard life in the Metro. Buy only if you seriously love the former game, and are desperate to get back into the Metro world which, if you did, I wouldn't blame you. It's a fun experiance, just a bad game.",1395261938,1395261938,False,1,0,0.4570637047290802,0,True,False,False

Incorporating stealth tactics as part of the gameplay while not unique adds variability in gameplay, however firefights are much more fun in my opinion since really all you do in stealth is sneak and slash throats. Not that that's not enjoyable, but there's not much else to stealth to make it more interesting. I rarely felt compelled to go stealth anyway while playing in normal since firefights were so manageable with customizable weapons, a big plus for the game. Storyline was certainly strong, but execution was little hasty at times. I enjoyed the very adult nature of the game certainly, felt like I was watching a film rather than just gaming. Some very threatening monsters keeps you on your toes, while other monster bosses seemed rather weak. Was never required to take on the flying beast, definitely should have. I would have liked to fight that beast.

1) The human AI is extremely dumb in this game and the stealth mechanic is binary. If you are in light you are visible otherwise you are completely invisible. You can walk up to every enemy in the game and stealth kill them as long as you kill them in a dark place. Most of the time you can kill multiple enemies right next to each other. They also do not react at all when you turn off lights even though sometimes the AI acknowledge it. This was a pretty big change from the first one where the AI was extremely agressive and knew exactly where you were if you were spotted. 

2) Boss Fights:  They are pretty terrible. Basically you will run around in circles kiting it while trying to figure out what to do, which can take multiple attempts. On a few of the boss fights I would end up running out of ammo beacuse I would waste ammo thinking I am making progress, but there was some other mechainc in the fightsthat I was missing and the instructions they try to give you weren't very clear. Either that or they would just glitch out completely

3) Ranger Hardcore:  Sort of a complete waste. It is basically hard mode with the HUD removed. There are no prompts for QTEs ,which lead to instant death, so basically just smash E during all cut scenes. There is no weapon inventory so that made it pretty difficult cycling through your secondary weapons (grenades, throwing knives, etc)  The mode also wasn't that hard, I never felt like I was struggling to stay alive in certain areas. Gear, ammo, and money seemed to be pretty easy and during all the human AI parts I rarely had to use any. I used the silenced pistol and shotgun for 98% of my playthrough.

Fortunately, the forums came to save the day (as usual), and where far more brilliant than their tech support by mentioning that all you had to do was go to Options > Game Options and turn off Advanced Physx - that's it. Wow.

On to the game. Beautiful graphics, great follow-up on the previous, good balance to easy at times to hard at times. Good boss fights that might have you loading your last save, but not so much that it frustrates you (last boss the exception). In the first game I found myself under stress for supplies - especially mask filters when on the surface, but this one the stress was gone with enough supplies to let me feel safe to explore, but still not want to waste too much time doing so.

The plot was good with good twists and a satisfying ending... the climax at the end was very well done requiring you to employ alternating tactics with every change in the battle. The game itself did this too, but not as much as the climax... not a bad thing either.

If you like a solid shooter with great graphics and a great plot you'll love Last Light. It's low metacritic score surprises me a little - it doesn't bring much new or groundbreaking to the table which is likely to blame, but the ups outseighed the downs enough to where that didn't bother me one bit - heck I liked playing a shooter where I didn't have to reinvent all the new hard to remember controls... but I'm starting to get older and lazier, so maybe that's just me.",1385411631,1395007207,True,0,0,0.478135854005813599,0,True,False,False

Firstly it should be noted that to enjoy this game fully, playing Metro 2033 is highly advisable, due to just getting used to the controls and for enjoying the wonderful story fully. On a side note 2033 is also a blindingly brilliant game. This game in many ways is a very suitable advancement of 2033, in the sense that the game mechanics feel ever so slightly smoother and they turn the eerie factor up by a few notches and really makes this game feel like an advancement from the last, whilst not departing from the main core of the first game and maintaining the delicately crafted atmosphere of the Post-apocalyptic Metro created in the first game. A new range of monsters  mixed with some of the old classics and a set of revamped human enemies, make it feel fresh but also reassuring similar and contribute to a nice blend of gameplay which saw me use a range of weapons and techniques in order to hit the sweet spots. As ever it is a gruelling and sometiems terrifying experience which certainly got me sweating at some points. The story which is brilliantly founded in the first game realises its full potential in thsi game and despite some slightly clunky story-telling mechanics really delivers. Basically Metro 2033 and this game make for one hell of a pairing and I'd highly reccommend playing both. Seriously  no idea how a very average game like bioshock infinite was in contention for game of the year over this masterpiece. Simply put both games  score 9.5/10, only really losing out that final 0.5 for not perhaps being as long as they should be and having some slightly restrictive and clunky gameplay mechanics, but I hardly notice these as I'm just happy to be enveloped by this games sheer genius.",1395003824,1395003824,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beaware,the PC version requires a good PC to run this on 1080p so keep this in mind.When I played the game,I suffer massive frame rate drop in certain part of the levels which is a bug in the game and it's still happen even when I lower the resolution.

Exploration is linear, but time to time they're some parts of the levels where exploration is pretty rewarding, and it will come to use when you need more air filters and ammo.As you explore the levels,you'll learn about the lives of people long before.

There are decent amount of customization to your weapons and you can swap or customize in little towns you pass by.Military grade rounds are your currency that you'll need to buy parts,ammo,and weapons.You can use the military grade as your ammo,but I'll recommend saving your military grade rounds and use regular rounds instead as it'll be helpful to buy ammo in the long run especially if you play on hard or ranger mode.

The enemies in the game are deadly,as using your tools like your flashlight and lighter will come in handy.THe enemies does have weak points so make sure you attack their weak points to save more ammo.

The two combining to give the player an ambient sense of hopelessness and decay.

Combat and stealth have been greatly improved from 2033. Using the same kill or knockout animation during stealth can get a little annoying but it is otherwise executed well. But it's the mutants you face that really steal the show and help instill terror in the player, especially when outnumbered and surrounded.

The makers really did a great job on making a credible post apocalyptic moscow ruined by nuclear radiation with mutants ruling the surface and the remnants of humanity huddled in pockets in the vast tunnels of the metro and its stations. The gritty, sad underground is only outdone by the eerie beauty of a ruined surface where everything is out to get you. Although underground it isn't exactly much better with humans still fighting eachother, now over the scarce resources.
Adding to this is a vast array of sounds and music and great use of lighting to make this game even creepier.

As stated, the game is linear, there is no deviating from your path really but that's ok, you are here for a story and a good story it is. Whether you go through this story guns blazing (it does feel good to blast a mutant from mere feet with a shotgun) which actually makes things harder for you, or if you go through it with stealth (silent weapons galor, Helsing ftw) for which you have ample opportunity, you will be engrossed.

shooting humans is a bit less scary, you just have to watch out you dont get seen, otherwise your in deep sh**

The game grips you from begining to end; you never feel without a purpose or are you ever faced with a lull in gameplay. From a thrilling dash from an army of Nazi's to a heart pounding rail-car sequence, this masterpeice is worth every penny.

The graphics here are top notch, especially during sequences above ground. The use of lighting is fantastic here, making the textures pop, while sunshafts above ground really help to sink in the apocalyptic landscape. Although NPC character models are sometimes overused, they look amazing nonetheless. The game uses shadow techniques to push an otherwordly theme at parts, which is admittingly creepy and fun to see.

Gameplay varies over the course of the game, though Metro heavily pushes and rewards the use of stealth through most areas. A lot of thought was put into the pathing of NPCs during these areas, making them challenging though not ridiculously so, still leaving a great sense of accomplishment if you managed to sneak through an area undetected. Areas using stealth have many different passages and dark corners to use to your advantage, allowing you to take on the opposition in any way you'd wish. Gunplay is very solid during sequences when stealth is not an option, with fully customizable guns and plenty of destructible cover. Though this is a linear game, there are plenty of knooks and crannys off the beaten path to be explored and awarded for, mostly with extra ammo. Plenty of scripted action sequences are packed into the game, from gunning your way down a runaway train to fending off an oncomming army. These sequences, along with challenging boss fights, make for a memorable experience. 

Metro's story is compelling, though very spelled out. Every chapter of the game begins with a monologue, either of your current task or of Artyom's thoughts on the situation. Journal entries are scattered throughout the game, and add further insight into how Arytom feels about the mission at hand. In Last Light, Arytom is again out to save the Metro and redeem himself for actions he commited in Metro 2033, along with familiar faces from the first game. Khan makes his first appearance very early in the game, an important character from the first game in the series. Though I won't spoil the plot, the game ties together nicely at the end, and leaves the story open for a further installment. 

When this game isn't on sale and is full retail at $40, it's a steal. Metro Last Light is plenty of fun and very thrilling, the story wraps up well and doesn't leave you feeling cheated, and with many ways to take on stealth sequences, the game has high replayability.

Being a fan of the Metro universe I am always eager to find out more about the Metro and Moscow City, and this game delivered.
I think to fully understand what goes on in Metro: LL you have to have played the first game, and/or read at least the first book, Metro 2033, I personally have no problem with that, but it could turn off players that are new to the Metro universe.

When Metro: LL was announced, hints were given towards it being a more open-world experience than Metro 2033, I must say that Metro: LL is in no way open, but it has some oppurtunity to explore and find items/lore, it is definately not an open world, and all the sections are on rails, meaning that you go from event to event in a specific preset order, and you can not deviate from that path.

Metro: LL has a bunch of nice challenges for the player, like trying to get the ""good"" ending by being as nice as you can, even if that sometimes makes you grit your teeth.

One thing that I really do not like about the game is that you have to pay for ranger mode, but I think that has been discussed enough.
Also, whoever they hired to do the females in this game should grow up and start getting a realistic grab on what a female is, the way the game portraits women is ridicilous and definately a negative point for me, even though I do like a beautiful woman as much as the next perv, this made me feel like it was ment for 13 year olds.

My final verdict is that Metro: LL is a must buy for anybody that likes a great storyline, and enjoys a solid FPS.
Even if you are not going to buy this game or Metro 2033, I recommend that you read the book(s), some of the best time you will ever spend.

I hope this review helps,

It is fairly linear but the world is so detailed that it doesn't matter.  NPC's feel alive and rarely if ever repeat themselves. Hell, theres a 25 minute theater performance you can sit and watch.  

As far as the gameplay goes it is a stealth/fps hybrid. You can blast your way through the levels or sneak through knifing or knocking out people.  The animations are well done and the guns are fun and customizable.  Compressed air rifle that fires ball bearings? Check.  Quad Barrel Shotgun?  Check.  You can tell some thought went into making believable post apocalyptic weapons.

43160,8357600,76561197965122430,0,4,640,0,640,1386822933,"I never played Metro 2033, so at first glance; I figured I was in for a Fallout 3 clone.  An expansive 25-hour journey with a compelling story littered with tangential side quests set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. While the setting is the same, that’s where their similarities end.

Metro: Last Light is a very linear first person shooter, incorporating stealth and resource management. Neither of these seemed necessary when playing on normal difficulty, so for the intended experience, I’d suggest a harder mode. It paces itself well; shifting between slow moments of atmospheric storytelling, faster paced combat and the occasional boss fight. But the FPS side of this game is not it’s strongest attribute. Your character never levels up in any way, or gains any new abilities (unless you count night vision). Aside from increasing the Kalash’s ammo, the weapon modifications made little difference on any of the wide selection of guns. If you’re looking for a shoot’em up gibfest, this isn’t the game; but certain mechanics enhance the realism and improve the experience. The best example of this being the gas mask, which the player must put on when going above ground, replace when damaged, recharge with scavenged filters and wipe off when covered with blood, debris or water.

The part of this game that really shines is the storytelling, or more specifically, the tone. It’s classified as horror, but it lacks the jump scares and excessive gore one might expect from this genre. Instead it has a more mature and suspenseful disposition reinforced by the dimly lit yet detailed level design. Unlike a run and gun shooter, Metro: Last Light encourages the player to patiently explore it’s environment, taking in the scenery and appreciating it. Notes revealing more of the story are randomly scattered throughout the levels, forcing the player to search in areas that would otherwise be passed without notice.

Graphically the game is great, considering the budget this studio had. Sure, the character animation is a bit stiff and the child voice acting is awful but the character models are good enough to not distract from the story and, like the movie Gravity, this game is a rare example of a product that becomes a different experience when using 3D. I’ve found 3D becomes tiresome in most games and I turn it off after a while, even 3D Vision Ready ones such as Metro: Last Light. But I played all 10 hours of this game with Nvidia 3D Vision enabled and it intensified the immersion in a way that couldn’t be accomplished otherwise (most notably when the gas mask was cracked or dirtied). As unpopular as 3D gaming is, I’m glad I have it for games like this. It’s also worth noting that the game runs on Mac as well as Linux.

I don’t like moral choice (karma) systems in games, but I don’t hate them; and there are ways of ameliorating them. One such method, employed by Metro: Last Light, is to hide it completely from the player, allowing them to make organic decisions during gameplay. The game has a good or bad ending, depending on certain choices and actions but the player is not told when something affects this moral meter or what their reward is for following a righteous path. Unfortunately, any semi-experienced gamer will recognize the telltale signs of a moral choice system (such as the option to kill or spare a defeated enemy), but at least this game tries.

These aren’t my favorite type of games, but playing through Metro: Last Light was one of the better single player experiences I’ve had, and if you have the patience to let the ambiance build I think you’ll enjoy it as much as I did.

What stood out for me in this game first and foremost are the graphics.  This is one of the few titles that rivals the likes of Crysis.  The graphical detail that this game has to offer is just amazing.  Even better if you turn on advanced PhysX!  During both the tunnel and outside missions, I felt like the developers did a great job of creating an immersive environment to play in.  I think that they created a realistic vision of what it would be like to live in a post nuclear-war environment.  The fog, ruins, tunnels, swamps, lighting, underground settlements, creatures and beasts all look spectacular. 

The game is linear and divided into chapters.  Even though it's linear, you can still do some exploration to find weapons, ammo, and collectibles.  The weapons in this game are all fun to use, and can be customized in shops.  The storyline will keep you interested, and there is plenty of lore to be read from diaries.  But what impressed me the most was all the lore you could listen to just by standing next to other people and children and listening to their conversations.  The attention to detail in these interactions was very impressive.  

In most chapters involving human enemies, you can play stealthily throughout.  There's even an achievement for not killing any humans throughout unless forced to.  I like the fact that you can directly affect the environment by turning light sources on and off.  Going in guns blazing is also a good choice because again, the weapon selection and gunplay is a plus.  My only gripe with Metro: Last Light is the A.I. behavior.  Human opponents sometimes act in stupid ways, can get stuck or go on loops, and some of their actions after they detect you simply don't make sense.  This might ruin immersion for some.  Replayability lies in the form of DLC mission packs.  The game also has 2 endings, so it might warrant a second full playthrough.

All in all, I highly recommend this game.  Especially if you like good graphics and environment.",1393176352,1393176352,True,70,0,0.748019993305206299,4,True,False,False

The story of Metro: Last Light is really amazing and its a great experience for lovers of post apocalyptic adventure games. Like myself, I am a lover of adventure and post apocalyptic games because of love the great amount of context shown around the game such as the conversations you hear while passing through stations, on the surface and in the tunnels.

As you progress on your adventure through the ruins of the metro and the surface of post apocalyptic Russia, you seem to pass a lot of odd and yet interesting occurrences such as notes you often find about the lives of the people before the Great War. Metro: Last Light takes place one year after the events of Metro 2033, following the canonical ending in which Artyom chose to proceed with the missile strike against the Dark Ones. Artyom, born a few years before the bombing in 2009, was raised underground in Timiryazevskaya station until it was overrun by a massive horde of rats. Since then, he lives with his adoptive father Alex in VDNKh (Exhibition).

In this game, stealth is a thing that is needed during certain missions to avoid detection. The stealth aspects in this game aren't amazing but they work fine.

The most striking moments are watching the interaction between NPC's when you visit population centers. While the voice acting is a little cheesy, it does not take away from the feeling that you are in a living breathing world. The atmospere outside of the friendly populated areas left me on the edge of my seat continuously. I swear I hear those damn spiders skittering about even after I shut the game down. The action is fun, challenging at times, and very realistic. The human enemies confusion when you first take out one of their comrades to when they pin point your location and begin pouring on the lead will rasie your blood ressure for sure. It did find it a little wonky that the NPC always stood fully straight when you knocked them out. It did not seem natural to have some go from a full crouch to standing tall after i tapped them on the shoulder.

The main game itself is unique and breathtaking but sadly it contains some parts that nearly ruin it. Those parts being scenarious where the player just stands in one spot firing magazine after magazine at near endless waves of enemies, taking fire from every corner of your eye. Such parts can be entertaining if it wasn't for the complete lack of resilience against enemy attacks in higher difficulties. 
Though every other part of the game consists of either stealth segments when encountering human adversaries, pure survival segments when encountering mutants or calm scenes where the player gets to explore the safe metro stations seeing the people and their daily struggles.

Second, I'm advanced Linux fan and experienced user. I'm using Linux for more than 14 years and from more than 10 didn't need to have any Windows in my home. So I was in ecstatic when I found out that MetroLL will be also in available in Linux.
Then I've started play.
The more I've played the more I was disappointed. And not about the game scenario, gameplay or whatever else related. I was disappointed with the quality of the game for Linux (comparing to Windows version). My hardware setup was far more better than given minimum requirement. But more I've played more I have feeling that this game wasn't roughly tested on Linux at all. I know that we are ""minor minority"" (Linux gamers) but for sake we are more than faithful with any of mainstream game published for our community.
Game was unplayable in my opinion for newbies with 2 cores, 4GB and decent GPU. Only my experience in other FPS games helped me to go through. But tricks what I was forced to use to go through was very frustrating because unstability of the game. Each fast action was ended with freeze of whole PC so to be able to finish game all my steps were very careful and with very big effort to minimize fast action scenes. This caused sometimes even very very boring gameplay (how long you can act as a sniper?).
So my recommendation is negative for Linux players. Maybe with some SteamMachines it goes smooth but I bet for my achievements that on each even best SteamMachine everyone will get at least few crashes of whole PC (how this possible to crash the PC during loading chapter?!?).

The story is just ok and the atmosphere in the game is good. This two things together was enough to keep me playing trough it.

Now over to the not so good stuff...
The graphics is really, really badly optimized for PC. I have a quite good gaming rigg but the game was still tanking my system like nothing I have seen before. I even got windows ""low memory"" warnings several times during the game. 
The game started up with only 20fps with everything at max, but after some figgeling around I manage to get it up to 40fps with acceptable eye-candy performance. 
Though the graphics did give good atmospheric environment, I would like to see my FPS go to at least 60. 
The games graphics is not in any form giving value for its resource usage. 

The sound is helping making the game atmospheric, but the surround part of the game is badly done. It sounds like they have tried to cheat with stereo and make it into surround.

The AI... This game have probably close to the worst AI I have ever seen in any game. Just walk around a wall and the enemy will stop because it lost sight of you. 
The stealth system in this game is a joke from an other world. It is beyond bad, more into the realm of laughable. 
As long as there is a shadow, you are invisible. There can be light all around you, but as long as you stand in that ""shadowy"" spot, you can not be seen, even if the ""enemy"" is standing right in front of you and looking at you. You dont even need to ""crouch"" walk to ubtain the stealthy aproch. As long as you stand in the shadow (and the blue light on you arm does not light up), you can walk normally and be invisible.
The fights in the game turns boring quite fast. The AI is stupid and the ""enemy"" dies easy and fast. There is close  to no challenge in the game. Even on hardcore. 

The game is as rail-shooter as you can get. Don't bother with exploring the rooms you find, you will not get anything from it. Just a waste of time, you may find some ammo, but ammo is never of an issue in this game. Other then that, some programmed jump-scare events now and then.

QTE, QTE, QTE... Did I mention the amount of QTE's there are in the game? Spam E, spam spacebar...

The user interface is a joke too. This game fells like it has been ported to PC from console just to grab some easy cash. Nothing has been done to improve the usage of PC with mouse and keyboard. You have to Google how to use the interface at times because nothing in the game or during the game tells you how to use the different things that are used with each button. Several buttons have multible function if you hold them in and/or push an other button.
If you want to change the option of using secondary abilities you have to PAUSE the game for then to choose what item (knife, granade, flame granade or clamor) you want to use... Why the hell cant we bind them to our 4,5,6,7,8 etc keys?
You are effectivly killling the ""heat of the fight"" by pausing the game like that. Not like that I neede the granade much anyway.
Just porting to grab easy cash...

As the game is now, I cant recommend buying it at its full price. 
If you think about buying this game on full price, don't touch it, even with a 10"" pole. Wait for a good sale, maybe around 5-10 euro price.

Good:
The storyline: Do you like Russia? Do you like Guns? Do you like Russians shooting guns at mutants? Then this game is for you! With a bit of easy going times and hard moments, Metro: Last Light was born!

Graphics: I think the graphics have a decent share on either the consoles or a PC platform. They have managed to keep it clean and smooth.

Bad:
Sudden framerate drops: This didn't happen often but when it did, it seemed like it happened in the worst moments. That really knocked my aim off and of coarse... got me killed.

The game ""Metro Last LIght"" is a continuation of ""Metro 2033"", the main character, Artyom, has to go to great lengths to stop the greatest threath the metro has ever known, the dark ones. 

The actual game itself offers a wide variaty of play styles that you may have to change in a givin situation. This is one of the main reasons I have enjoyed the game to such an extent. Insted of making the game an open world game, the developers give you a similar feeling by almost always giving you 2 different ways to aproach a givin situation, this is even more so stated because the game has multiple ednings *wink, wink*. As for graphcis and emmersion, I think they deserve to be mentioned by themselves. This really shows the attention to detail that deep silver and THQ put into designing this game. In some areas if you listen in on conversation you can hear references to Metro 2033 and even the book Metro 2033 written by Dmitry Glukhovsky (the entire series is based of his work). I spent over a year waiting for and anticipatiing this game and was glad the transition from THQ to deep silver went smoothly, now, almost a year later with alot of gameplay expierence I can recommend this game, alot. Anyways, those are my thoughts on the game; happy hunting rangers!

Metro: Last Light was included in neither of these catagories: I had played more than half of Metro 2033 and enjoyed the game, but nothing really stood out and there weren't many ""wow"" moments. While I found 2033 to be a fun experience, overall I was frustrated by the incredibly difficult stealth mechanics at some points, the poor autosave structure and timing, and the completely rediculous ways I would be killed sometimes that resulted in redoing a long segment of a very hard level. Unfortunately, I also played the game on a low-power laptop that was only able to get 60FPS on normal/low settings, so the graphics were very underwhelming to me. Those flaws aside, I still enjoyed playing 2033, maybe a 7.5/10 experience. However, Metro: Last Light blew me away.

The best place, and most obvious place to start with Last Light is the graphics. And my goodness, they are absolutely stunning. Being able to crank up the graphics to the max on my rig actually very much elevated the gameplay experience and the level of immersion. The textures are flawless, the stitching on the cloth looks so lifelike it's scary, guns look like they have really been battered by years of poor treatment and harsh environments, and the ambient and weather effects sometimes literally made my jaw drop. This game is beyond gorgeous, and even on the lower settings it still looks damn good, which would've been nice to see on my laptop instead of the graphics of 2033. Some effects that really shine are the lighting and gunfire in the dark Metro tunnels, the light flashes from the muzzles of assault rifles have a level of realism on par with games such as Crysis and I got so immersed sometimes I would get shocked by loading screens! 

The visuals of Last Light are an amazing achievement, but another feature that also is incredibly improved in the sequel to 2033 is the gameplay. The gunplay especially in 2033 felt sluggish to respond and like guns had no real recoil. With the help of the fantastic visuals and much improved combat however, Metro Last Light is as close to real as you can get without actually being in the game. Guns sound much better, have a lot of realistic recoil, let out puffs of steam as you fire, create muzzle flash differently in light, dark, and tunnel environments, the gameplay in Last Light is far better than other survival games such as Fallout, Borderlands 2, and even the game that most people play just because of good gunplay, Call Of Duty. While Metro 2033 occassionally felt like a chore to grind through, there was never a single moment in Last Light that the gameplay bored me.

The final aspect I would like to discuss in this review is the story. For some reason the story in Last Light engaged me more than in 2033, I don't know if everyone will feel the same but that is just my experience. I felt that the story in Last Light was overall quite strong and didn't bore me at all. It surely had its stumbles (awkward stip club moment that was thrown in for no reason besides showing off some impressive physics), but it also had some good plot twists (a specific moment close before that stip club moment is one specific example) and the karma side of the game is much more pronounced than in 2033. Sometimes I would encounter myself on a mission that I had no idea why I was doing it, but I eventually got back on track down the road as to a purposeful mission.

Overall, Metro: Last Light is a masterpiece. The visuals are rivaled only by Crysis 3, the gameplay drastically improves upon its predecessors, and the story, while ocassionally faltering, generally is engaging and entertaining. I give this game a 9.3/10, absolutely fantastic, and a must-have.",1392002527,1392002527,True,3,0,0.536745667457580566,11,True,False,False

Even on normal mode I find myself jealously rationing my ammo supply and looting everything, even taking extra risks to further my supply, the game does offer a few extra twists and turns, that are risky but rewarding.

I do have a few things about this game I didn't like, however.  For one thing, the main female character, Anna.  She starts off as the main characters partner, and her attitude is less than favorable, gives him a hard time, then just like that, first mission with her, and you get seperated and go on these crazy adventures by yourself, then later, after several hours into the game, after only having a very brief encounter with her, lets say, 20 minutes tops.  She's suddenly all over you after you save her, wanting the main characters dick.  There was NO time for any real character development, it just felt like a cheap excuse to see some nipple (durr spoilers) and to more or less turn what could have been a really well done character development turn into a cheap reward for a male power fantasy.  Plus for any one that's I dunno, gay, kind of awkward.  Plus like, it felt pretty dumb, oh you shot at mutan bugs, well here now some bitch you hardly know wants your dick, grats bro.  I would have liked to have been able to interact with certain side events too, but you're only allowed to be a bystander.  Like when these two guys bullied this old man out of his supply he was going to sell.  Why couldn't I have a choice to intervene?  

But overall, I'd recommend this game, a nice filler for the next fallout, if post apocalyptic nuclear wasteland games are you're thing, they're definitely mine~

The story answers a lot of questions that was left in Metro 2033, that's something I was missing in 2033. The stealth is finally playable even if it's a dumb stealth, it reminded me some Splinter Cell where guards couldn't see you 50 cm in front of them. Litteraly. The facials animations has been improved too so the characters have finally a personality even if it can still be improved. The game is as long as Metro 2033 which isn't a bad thing.

Now the bad parts, the ""bosses"" fight. This was a complete pain in the ass where you just waste bullets. Some parts of the game are out rageous. The guards are stupid, so stupid, not as stupid as in PD2 but at least they can aim properly. Metro is supposed to be ""horrifying"".  Horrifying my ass. This is not scary.

Metro Last Light takes what made the previous game good and made it better. There is nothing MLL does that was done better in the previous game... and also, the engine is MUCH more optimised in this game, so it runs better and faster than the previous game.
(Well, one thing is worse... hard mode [""ranger mode""] is now DLC, stupidly... but the game is still wonderful and challenging without it, I did not bother with ranger mode personally)

You take the role of Artyom again, and the story arc is just as engaging as the previous. The world was cratfed beautifully, and even on lower settings this game will look fantastic. The game plays and feels like the first, but with improved stealth (yes!), combat, and interface.

DLCs I have played: (DLCs are pretty cheap which is dope)
Faction Pack: Worth it overall. The Reich level is real terrible though, but the other levels are good. 
Developer Pack: Very underwhelming. You could avoid this and not miss much, not terrible, just meh.
Chronicles Pack: Also kinda underwhelming, but cool. It would have been better if they cut out the Khan and Anna levels and made a longer, more diverse Pavel level, which is the best of the three.",1386052578,1391364313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fun FPS. The story is compelling. The gameplay fun. Sneaking missions done well. The weapons, and difficulty handle well. 

The Bad:
Achievements...
One they are buggy as heck. Many cannot be accomplished simply because the game doesn't register them. Like the fact that I've fallen in the swamp 30-40 times--achievement is for 10! Two, I've 20 out of 70 achievements that cannot be achieved because I've not purchased the DLC. I really don't understand why they're there. Also, this adds confusion. For instance there's a level called 'Pavel'--in the regular game--and an achievement for beating the Pavel level, but no wait, that's the DLC Pavel Level??? Huh? Same issue with the Khan level/achievement. 10 head-shots with sniper rifle, but only DLC sniper rifle? Why is this achievement here?

Why include achievements if they don't work? I also find it distasteful to include achievements for something I've not purchased.

Achievements that do not work so far: 5 (Diver, Soup, Shadow, Inferno, and Ever Vigilant)

Conclusion:
Still a fun time if you can get past these anomalies. They distracted me from the game a bit. I’d give the game 9.5/10 if it was fully functional—perhaps 8/10 due to issues described. -.5 for the non well named or described buggy achievements; -1 for including achievements for DLC not yet--perhaps ever--purchased.",1390548844,1390705847,True,0,0,0.499108701944351196,0,True,False,False

Metro: Last Light is a masterpiece that deserves its place as one of the best games to be released in 2013. 

Story:
The plot in this game is a shining example of just how powerful a story driven game can be, having characters you meet in-game make an impact and become memorable. This was a huge improvement from metro 2033 where there really wasn’t a real connection with any allies or villains. Last light brings about both the best and worst sides of humanity with several characters you’ll meet along the road. 

The reason why I bring up characters so much is because it is essentially what makes a good story. Whether it is a story of betrayal and hatred or love and happiness, the story can only be as strong as its characters, much like Bioshock, where you observe people living their lives in a new world that has crumbled or is flawed in a drastic way.  Last Light is a gritty and dark science fiction story that questions humanity’s goals and characteristics concluding with a very satisfying end (I got the bad ending BTW haha).

Gameplay:
This game is a clear step up from its predecessor in every regard. You can now successfully sneak through most of the game and have the ability to take down enemies (A mechanic I always expect to have in any game where stealth is involved). I have to commend the developers for clearly showing that they care about the franchise by making a sequel that clearly shows they worked hard to improve (unlike many other “triple A”   franchises sequels these days *cough cough… CoD …..*cough). 

The auto save system is improved as well. The game auto saves often and in my experience in safe zones where you aren’t surrounded by monsters or right before a boss. Although I would still prefer to save manually, this is one of the better auto-save mechanics. 

The only negatives I can say are that this game is a bit too easy. I played it on Hardcore Ranger the first time though (which I’ll talk about in a second) and didn’t think it was too challenging, especially when sneaking. I would also like to start seeing linear based games be longer than the usual 10 to 12 hour campaign standard. If story mode is the game’s focus (done very well in this game) I expect more. This is more of a criticism for all modern linear games however.

This game had a small controversy with the Ranger Hardcore mode, where they decided to sell this difficulty as a DLC. This practice should never be done as it reflects very poorly on the product. As a customer, I now see that this company is ‘okay’ with selling an unfinished game, charging you extra to get the 5% they took out. Another reason I am disappointed with this choice is that Ranger mode is really just a difficulty that takes away you HUD and makes AI’s smarter. Not cool to charge extra for core features of a game. Now before I go on I don’t know if the developers were forced to do this but I just don’t want this to continue and be copied by other companies. The ranger mode itself was also a bit poorly thought out as you cannot see what weapon to equip and therefore you can't tell whether you are going to throw a knife or grenade at an enemy…*facepalm.

Graphics (PC version only):
Gorgeous…Textures look worthy of next gen. The game also makes use of very good light effects that make for a dramatic but beautiful enviroment. Kudos to the developers on this, the game is eye candy.

Sound:
The voice acting is good in this game. As far as I'm concerned these are genuine Russian 
accents that make the game feel very authenitc just shy of going all out and be Russian with subs. More emotion and depth is sought by me but is still passable

The music and atmospheric sound is top notch. Excellent work in this department.

Conclusion:
This is one of my favorite games from 2013 that I can only praise as an excellent entry and makes me hopeful to see other games follow its lead.

First being the incredible soundtrack made personally for this game. I loved how the music certainly put the view in place with certain levels during the gameplay. I met very difficult situations that caused me to fail quite a bit, but the game never let me out of its' grasp. I was stuck playing this for many hours straight, finding hidden rooms and different things to do in the game, taking time in this game is a must at times in need for supplies (To be honest.). I love how suspenseful and a bit frightening the game is, but the best being the different parts of the game that... Well to put it to unspoiling terms... Never let you know what's going to hit you. Byfar this is the best singleplayer game (Apart from the Half-Life series that was also good.), and I'm actually going to go through Metro 2033 again just to play this as well and have the full feel for the game. The atmosphere though... Was extremely good, some of it can make you feel like you are going to die any second, while another could make you feel amazingly safe and comfortable during the game. Another was the amounts of different guns and customizations, I loved how they looked (My favorite being this one amazing one-shot sniper I found in the game that does incredible amounts of damage.). I also loved the Flashlight, It was basically my only friend during the gameplay, I don't care what anyone says about it, that thing including the Lighter saved my life everytime. To be honest, I loved how the Soldiers from all the different Clans/Groups/Etc. look, it was good to see friendlies, but... On the otherhand enemies aren't as good, unless you are scavenging for ammo/airtanks/gasmasks/etc. I read basically all the Notes I got through my first playthrough, I wish there were more notes, but I didn't mind it. But when I read the notes it added foreshadowing and a bit of suspense to let you know what was to come. But all in all this game was really good! I loved it, and the campaign was long enough to keep me on edge for quite a while. So to whomever is reading this, I hope you get this amazing game! It's worth it! Oh and, I dare you to play it in the dark! It's better that way!

At first it took a while getting used to the controls as they are not as customisable as I would like. The main downfall being that you cannot choose to toggle ADS, rather you have to go through the entire game holding down the ADS button while trying to target fast morning enemies with a laggy aiming system. It is almost like it has mouse acceleration constantly on as the game was designed for console duel shock controllers and just ported to PC.

After getting used to the controls I started playing through the game. I enjoyed the mission design and commentary between levels. These systems complimented each other and combined told the story well.

The characters in the game were easy to get along with and I found myself more immersed in the story when they were acting rather than feeling like i was sitting through another Resident Evil.

The graphics were outstanding on my PC. However there are not a lot of people with high end gaming PC's out there and I would hate to see how this un optimised environments melted low end PC's and consoles completely destroying the playability at either low FPS or poor graphical quality/content.

My first run through took me just over 15 hours. Needless to say, by today’s standards that is not a lot of content. By finishing the game I did unlock some new levels but have no interest in playing them because I was just happy to get through to the end of the game. The puzzles were mind numbingly boring and monotones (start the petrol powered winch, no petrol, find a fuel can, it's empty ARG!). The enemies were many... but few variations. The boss fights were small and seemed pointless. Even the ending of the game was too easy and seemed more like an anticlimax rather than the great victory it was meant to be,

One thing I thoroughly enjoyed in this game was the diversity of weapons and the imagination that went into them. I thought having a rechargeable / depressurising weapon by hand made for some interesting fights as your light dimmed and your air pressure dropped with enemies surrounding you.",1390439714,1390439908,True,0,0,0.499108701944351196,0,True,False,False

By that i mean if you divide the game into five equal parts, the first four are great while the fifth is just sitting there. This game is basically the subway of Fallout 3, which is still high praise in my book. Voice acting is mediocre. When the story comes to the end it makes no sense. Story should have been just plain and simple revenge and it would have upped the value to me.

Graphics - Superb on my machine. Visually stunning. At moments you can just sit and look. Lighting effects are on a level of their own. However, very demanding. I don't see many people getting the full effect of the graphics without being on current gen.
Characters - Meh. Supporting characters seemed to be more interesting than my own character. Larger supporting role characters seemed to be just thrown together.
Story - Started strong and for the most part stayed on par. Dipped to low levels in what I was believeing to be more interesting sequences.
Gameplay - Very nice. Controls. In Game physics. Executions. and AI were done very well. Stealth kills or all out war, mechanics are on par with some of the larger titles.

Overall I'd say this game is a lot of fun as long as you don't wrap yourself up in the story or pay attention to the characters. A lot of fun and great looking, but empty. Not open world and that is the biggest handicap. You can explore areas outside and in the tunnels, but why bother when you have a strait forward story arc that requires you to do none of that. 4 out of 5 stars with the great gameplay and stunning graphics far superceeding the faults of character creation and story.",1390434365,1390434365,True,1,0,0.520849466323852539,0,True,False,False

You'll see what I'm talking about when you end up in a destroyed bridge, trying to hide from demons and nosalies, while cleaning the blood from your gas mask and counting the seconds to change your air filter, so you don't choke to death. And if you think this is bad, wait untill you reach the catacombs, where you will constantly hear the noises of footsteps near you, and when you think you are reaching the exit, your lantern stops working, so you must use your crappy lighter to illuminate the walls (considering how good the light effects are, this is really tense).

I am a big fan of the first game, Metro 2033. I was excited when 4A announced Metro: Last Light. Now, after beating it, here's what I have to say:

Unlike the first game, M:LL is not that hard, which, in my opinion, is not a good thing. Of course, it's not bad, but the high difficulty was one of the things that made Metro 2033 shine. I've rarely had problems with ammo or filters. You now have 3 universal weapon slots, at first I thought this was a bad idea, but it actually works pretty well.

There were some things that got better, while other were changed to make the game a little easier. Yes, I'm talking about your watch. It's not as good looking as Metro 2033's watch, but it still act as a real watch, which is nice. The timer showing how much air you still have is WAY simpler, instead of colors and pointers, you now have a simple timer showing the time in minutes and seconds. In my opinion, this change was good, because know you must manually change your air filter, which increases the immersion.

Weapons can now be modded. There are not many different mods to buy, but at least you know have something else to spend your military ammo. Most guns from the first game appear in the sequel, like the Bastard and the Helsing. There are new guns too, like the Sniper Rifle, and the awesome Gatling Gun (it's extremely hard to find one, and you can't reload it, so you can't keep it for too long, but it's fun to use when you want to kill everything in front of you without releasing the trigger)

The graphics are... I have no words to express how beautiful the game is. My only complain here is regarding the animation, the characters are a little stiff, they don't move too much, but considering that 80% of the time you are alone, and the only humans near you are decomposing and/or being devoured by mutants, that shouldn't be a problem ;)
The voice acting in english is okay, but here's my advice: play the game in russian with english subtitles, it sounds way better.

Well, this is it. Some things are better, others are worse, but it feels like a true Metro game (an easier game, I must add).

Lots of people and critics flamed the game because of the gameplay for the one they said it was archaic and outdated. I personnally consider the gameplay is quite good. Its oldschool feeling, of the weapons especially, gives us pretty nice sensations, it's very realistic.

Its cons are definitely the story which is not very original or interesting. Plus your character who doesn't speak. And probably the feeling of a very linear game which is frustrating since lots of us probably would have prefered a more open world and a renforced RPG aspect.

Minor gripes appear rarely as I experienced this thrill ride all game developers need to be jealous of. 

It's easy to feel immersed in the level design, and to build an immediate connection with the narrative woven throughout. Explore the radioactive surface of a war torned Russia, finding filters to survive, but turn around only to see two mutants staring at you, drooling with hunger. Have a guard stumble upon your wheels, and kill him upon surprise, with a knife to the head. Take on new enemy types as you progress through catacombs, swamps, and a moving train. And all the while making moral choices, and understanding your world, to decide the fate of the Metro.

Last Light offers a few glimpses of real scarcity in it's survival with more than enough filters to breath. There are off the path moments of chilling horror with mysterious happenings that, in retrospect, appear cliche and out of place underneath the reign of fire atmosphere. Forgivable interfaces for purchasing weapon customizations are forgotten as well once you return to the action. 

And that action is usually of your choice. Choose to be a pacifist, a panther, or a hunter. For me it was satisfying to try as many different approaches as possible to liven up the gameplay as it did have moments of repetition - necessary as they may have been for the story. Those choices were leading me to an uncertain conclusion as to what ending I would achieve. 
 
Yet, there is one thing that is certain. Last Light, like its predessecor, is always going to be on sale for a great price during Steam Sales. And that is a steal for what you get in return. Everything about this game communicates a front to back care for the finest of details. Personally, this is a game that sets the bar high for the first person shooter genre, and must be a call to action to studios. Envy this, and try to do better.

This game is very much on the rails, with no freedom to move beyond the pre-designed zones, and has several somewhat contrived drops into boss killing zones.

That's all very well, but on top it uses a particularly annoying implementation of checkpoints, with chapter starts and one global checkpoint only available for re-load. I got to a particular battle near the end of the game where it saves at the end of the main battle, just before a second group of enemies appears, and I get shot to death instantly after the save. Therefore I get shot instantly on attempting to re-load. The only solution is to play it from the top of the Chapter, and honestly I've had enough of doing that in this game and really can't be bothered.

Another notable example of how this method doesn't really work properly was when an earlier boss battle dumped me in the water (fine, it's part of the game), but a glitch meant it checkpoint saved in the water as I was past the map marker, and then in any re-loads I was pinned apparently just off the map underwater and unable to move - again forcing a whole Chapter restart and then fighting the boss all over again. That was just plain boring.

I don't have much time for gaming these days, this game is OK for most of it, but the do-it-over-and-over-again gameplay just ends up not being fun and I have better games to play in my limited time - ones that present me with new things at each session, not the a same thing over and over.

Disappointed - it could've been so much better, even if they just kept a track of all checkpoints instead of the one would've been a significant difference. That's  console imports for you....",1390234769,1390234769,False,1,0,0.481727480888366699,0,True,False,False

How ironic - the game itself is so [b]full[/b] of lamps, fire, blown-up improvised sky-lights....that last light is a very ironic phrase.  BUT I digress. 

The game itslelf is a recent sequel of the popular (for die hard post apocolyptia fan boys) Metro 2033. Heres an Idea game developers - if you want to immerse us in a game, then introduce the timeframe in the GAME. YES - i know the game is based off a book written by a russain bad ass with a bad ass imagination. Most russains do because they are just generally bad ass. 

You start off listening to an accent that most people love hearing because again - RUSSAINS ARE BAD ASS - as he tells a story about the end of the previous game and how he royally fucked up these dudes known as ""dark ones"". OKAY metro - i understand the ominus stature of the creature - but ""dark one"" come on - use atleast some of that money thats being shoved down your gullet like a college girl drunk on spring break and figure out a bloody proper name for an enemy. It almost seems like the name just never got changed after they moved on from story boarding. 

Once you begin playing you spend an awful amount of time wandering around in places, or from place to place - and not knowing fucking why!! You end up one point walking through a swamp to get to a church because your buddies are there. Why couldnt' i just take the tunnels this game is so in love with advertising? why did i have to go up to the scary place? oh yeah - becuase you have to take that time every once in a while an remind me that this game is primarily based on metro tunnel combat.

At one point you are tossed up on the the surface to wander around and find a way right back into the metro as is the case with most time where you are tossed up there. Its like the writers remembered you'd been underground too long and just tossed you up there to oggle the skybox and destroyed motherland for a few minutes while you run away from over powered baddies with FUCKING WINGS that carry you off a few hundred yards and drop you and do a [strike]inconcievable[/strike] stupid amount of damage to you. 

[i] HA HA[/i] I know they're saying [i] This is designed to make you fear the surface[/i] and all it really did was piss me off about going up there. Like i always said - mother fucker. now i have to run around with my pointless guns that might as well shoot cocaine at the monsters as they really do is piss them off and make them rage and run around and become harder to aim and and eventually kill if youre willing to waste the ammo on them as i found that running away to the next auto map loadie save point made them afraid of that area. 

I can't say the game didn't have its share of good things. the map itself is there but its usefullness is rightly limited as it [b] bloddy should be[/b]. i hate games with maps that have giant lines drawn like [B] GO HERE [/B] no one does that in real life. Another cool navigation thing is that your lighter flame will lean in the direction you're supposed to go. it's subtle enought to be amazing.

Combat against human enemies is scaled very well and always approachable in the bull seeing red way or the sam fisher the way sam fisher is supposed to be played way. 

all in all the story is inriching and entising and I loved it because I happen to be one of those aformentioned post apocolyptia fan boys so the game rocks and if you don't like post nueclear fallout games with russain narrations that have awesome combat and mosntsers then FUCK YOU",1390208177,1390208338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And this difference is good. First of all - Last Light looks much more polished than it's predecessor, with smoother animation and insane amount of details of the enviornment (especially the parts of outside world). Even the protagonist now casts the shadow (hello, FEAR), though he is still a floating camera (you can't see his legs when watching down).

The second thing that was enhanced a lot is a gunplay. It feels less clunky and much more fun due to possibility of weapons upgrades. 4-barrelled shotgun? Why not? A silencer for RPK? Easy! Gunplay provides a ton of variety and adds replayability.

Variety is represented in the level design also. Many parts of the game can be beaten in a Rambo or in a Solid Snake ways. The credit here goes to stealth system, that is much more convenient comparing to Metro 2033, where the AI and your stealth indicator were so random you could not rate your chances of staying undetected.

The setting itself is shown in a much greater way - you can just print your screenshots and make the postcards out of them. The destroyed versions of Kremlin, Saint Basil's Cathedral or Cathedral of Christ the Saviour look very natural and realistic. There is even the abandoned mummy of Lenin that turned into a skeleton. Good riddance!

Many fans of the first game admitted the weakness of the plot, but I was ok with it. Some hated on the love story, but that is actually very subtle and not emphasized in any way. Not as hardcore as the first game? Try ranger mode - it is very unforgiving on some levels.

Overall I would say that this game is definetely an achievement for post-soviet developers in the FPS genre (STALKER seems very poor in comparison). More than that, this goes as far as to be claimed the best FPS of 2013 (Bioshock Infinite is just too plastic for that). Honestly, I have not been experiencing so pure FPS joy since HL2. The linearity of Metro is the only thing that can be and should be improved. That is the only serious issue.

Probably making their way out of vault 101 to find their long-lost dad and purify the capital wasteland. The Russians though, they do things with a little more... explody-ness?
Metro: Last Light is the sequel to Metro: 2033, a game set in the nuclear wasteland of Russia where the Communists and Reich have risen again to claim dominance over the underground (and above-ground) of the, now derelict, Moscow. I didn't play the first game, but one of my friends would not. stop. banging. on. about. it. So up it came on a Steam sale one day (as always) so i thought I'd grab it.

The game could be compared to Fallout without the RPG focus and more first-person action. The story is fantastic. I made sure I watched a cut-scene summary on youtube of 2033 before playing Last Light and I'd advise anyone who hasn't played the first to do the same. The game encourages you to play in stealth, but you can blast your way through if you're more akin to the brutal approach.

The weapons are something I haven't really seen before. Many of them operate on air pressure. As you use ammunition, you also need to pump the guns compressor in order to keep it firing. Also, your flashlight is dynamo powered so it needs to be pumped to remain illuminated. There are areas filled with toxic gas so a gas mask must be worn and must be loaded with new gas filters every 5 minutes or so. All these interesting additions make a higher workload for the player and more things to keep a tab on as you play. It's not simply having enough ammo, you need to keep your weapons pressurized and keep an eye on how much air you have left.

In the game you collect currency ""bullets"" that are used to buy weapons, ammo and upgrades. These bullets can be used in your guns and provide a huge amount of damage, but using them like that is expensive. Much to my frustration at one point I thought ""Damn I'm just owning these guys"" :d. Unfortunately it was because I ran out of normal ammunition and had automatically loaded my money bullets into the gun. This transpired in me having zilch money to buy some weapon upgrades later on.

Occasionally the NPC's in the crowded areas can be a little difficult. They can block your path if they're having a conversation.

""Comrade G00CH, are you be giving me currency-money-bullets? In exchange, I feed you goulash and massage nogi""
No god damnit! Get the hell out of the way! Jesus!
""Da. No footrub, OK""

The only real complaint I could raise is that it is easy to get lost in the game. I have had to go to Youtube at 2 points just to find the door into the next area. The environments are very dark so if you're paying in the daytime I'd advise raising your gamma higher.

Although Metro 2033 was a great game by itself, one could easily see that THQ had a limited budget regarding the development of the story and the characters you meet along the way.

However, Metro: Last Light turned out to be an amazing post-apocolyptic survival/horror FPS. One could easily say that the developers did a great amount of research regarding all aspects of the environment, the characters and the story line when comparing it to the book. Characters are much more unique, the environment (although Metro 2033 did a great job with it) has also been improved and the story line is just breath taking. 
Offering you 2 different endings to the magnificent story, Last Light will force you to play this game more than once due to the flexible gameplay mechanics and the excellent level design, packing both intense and immersive combat situations and/or shit-yourself moments tensed up with the creepy ambient sounds.

Be sure to grab the Ranger Mode DLC, Metro isn't the same if you don't play it set on the Ranger difficulty, it's how it's meant to be played.

All in all, this is a great game with fun DLC's. One of the best, if not the best, games of 2013, no doubt. Just be sure your PC will be able to handle the graphic requirements, it's a small price to pay for stunning visuals!

#1 Poor direction.  You spend a lot of time having no idea where you are or where you are supposed to go.  Running around wondering where you are supposed to go while rapidly running out of gasmask time is NOT fun.   This is just a ploy to make the game seem longer than it really is.

#2 End of Level bosses that are a lot harder than they need to be.  You pound on them until you find a weakness but this takes several attempts to figure out and becomes more frustrating than fun. This is another ploy to make the game seem longer than it really is.

#3  When the end of level boss kills you, you start that bit again but you cannot skip the cut scene at the start even though you have already seen it a dozen times.

The Lighting effects, Graphics, Rendering, Monsters, Gun-play. Hell, pretty much just about everything in this game is damn near Perfect.

43160,8633725,76561198078208192,477,2,804,0,585,1400274490,"Metro: Last Light, what a game. It is undoubtedly in my top ten games of 2013, if not all time. This game (DLCs aside) is definitely an 8/10 or a 9/10 and this is for multiple reasons, which I will explain below. 


[b]The Environment:[/b]
Metro: Last Light has some of the most stunning environments; from dark, depressing tunnels filled with cobwebs and rotting bodies, to the breathtaking views of post-apocalyptic Moscow. The developers added so much detail to the environment around you, from small things like a headlamp from a dead explorer that flickers in the dark tunnels to massive storms on the surface which blast the landscape (and your ears). I had the game set on the ""High"" graphics quality (due to fps issues) and the environment was still excellent, when set on ""Very High"" it was downright stunning. If you are a fan of games that put time into the environments that it creates, Metro: Last Light is for you.

[b]The Sound Effects and Voice Acting:[/b]
From the sound of thunder and lightning, to your own gasping breaths as you frantically search for another gas-mask on the surface while choking on the irradiated air, Metro: Last Light offers an amazing array of sounds to further immerse you in the game. As you delve deeper into the Metro tunnels, the clicks and taps of various creatures stalking you in the darkness penetrates the area around while you wind up your flashlight with a distinctive sound. Within the Metro, the sounds are second to none and really help to immerse you. The voice acting is also excellent. The developers thrust you into crowded cities which feel alive because of the conversations you can overhear. It seems natural because of the voice acting. Much of the history and happenings of the Metro can be heard through these conversations, and it's worth it every once in a while to stop and listen to the people around you. 

[b]The Graphics:[/b]
The graphics of Metro: Last Light can be accurately described in one word: Stunning
From the near-perfect lip syncing and facial expressions, to the murky swamps of Moscow, the graphics quality of this game are on par. For those who have played Metro 2033, you will only find improvements in Metro: Last Light 

[b]The Story:[/b]
The story of Metro: Last Light is quite decent, although not the most unique. In a nutshell, the story is that of a selfless hero who makes many sacrifices to see everyone benefit. I won't be giving away any spoilers for those who haven’t played it, but I can say that if you are a fan of a FPS with a decent story, Metro: Last Light is for you. Keep in mind, however, that Metro: Last Light is not an open world explorer and has a very linear storyline and gameplay as you complete levels. 

[b]The Characters:[/b]
These are what makes this game, and also what doesn't. By this I mean that the men and women you interact with as you play Artyom are some of the most colorful people (for the most part). There is one character that stands out, Pavel, and he is with you for most of your travels. You learn to love and hate this character as the story progresses. The interactions between Artyom and Pavel are always interesting, and at times funny. There are, however, some bad characters. The only female character in this game is somewhat dry and serves only as a love interest for Artyom near the end of the game (she only appears in the first few missions and the last few missions; you will play the majority of the game without even mentioning her). Apart from that, you will fight a host of bad-guys, from the Nazis to the Soviets and will you get to interact with all of them, listen in on their conversations through vents while having a blast doing so. 

One of the major drawbacks, however, is Artyom. He is a silent protagonist for all of the game, except the loading screens, where he tells you different facts about what he is doing there or who he is going with. All in all, it was a disappointment to not hear Artyom respond to when characters talk to him, this makes it seem like the characters you are interacting with are just talking with themselves. If the developers hired a voice-actor for the loading screens, they should have done so for the gameplay. 

[b]The A.I.:[/b]
I completed the game on the hardest difficulty (not Ranger, as that is a DLC). What made this difficult was not necessarily the AI, but the lack of ammunition and the amount of enemies. At best, the A.I. is somewhat difficult but won't give experienced FPS players any difficulty. When in stealth, the A.I. acts quite stupid and unrealistic, allowing you to stealth kill them while you've been standing within close proximity for the last five minutes and they've even looked at you. All in all, the A.I. is average and brings down my score of the game. 


[b]Extra Content:[/b] 
I purchased a season pass for this game, but have yet to complete all of the DLC content. However, the content that I have played has added some extra gameplay and story from different perspectives within the Metro. All in all, however, unless you are a huge Metro: Last Light fan, you can live without the DLCs. 


[b]Final Verdict:[/b]
This game is great, plain and simple. In my opinion, it is a must own for anybody who enjoys a storyline and shooters. From the characters to the environment, Metro: Last Light is an excellent expereince, right up to the credits. This game is easily an 8/10 and possibly a 9/10.

Wow. Gorgeous graphics, immersive gameplay and a storyline that really grips your imagination. There's so many levels to the newest edition that it will make you FEEL the power of the story, I honestly haven't ""felt"" a game in a long while.

The only thing that I wish it had was.... More! Because I don't feel complete, I feel like I'm missing something, more dialogue and especially more to the end, but not because it needs it, but because I NEED IT!

If you're a fan of games like Bioshock, DOOM, Half-life and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. you are sure to love Metro - both of them. I really enjoyed them.

Can be a bit demanding on computer specs, even my GPU was having a hard time and at the end battle my screen froze a couple times, but other than that, I ran on ultra settings.

I picked it up over the steam holdiay say for $13 and have to say was the best $13 I have ever spent. Right off the back I want to talk about how beautiful this game is. The lighting and water effects are breath taking and really the entire environment is incredible. The out door sections are breathtaking and the time spent in the metro itself is both beautiful and very creepy. Along with the incredibly beauty of the game. the sound design is also superb. Footsteps, monster growls, gunshots, and water all sound amazing along with great atmospheric sound. This incredible display of sound and graphics truly brings an imersive experience. I have to say though the only way to truly appreciate the beauty of the game is with a high end pc, the game no doubt will be very enjoyable without a high end pc but the emersion factor that you get from this game with maxed out settings is something truly special. Aside from the beauty of the game, the story was fantastic. I would recommend playing the Metro 2033 (the previous game) or reading about just to get an idea of what is happening. The story realy is a non stop thrill and really brings the player in. I myself found it very hard to stop playing it, in fact I bought the game and beat the same night just becasue I could not stop playing it. The story gets to the point where you just have to know what is going to happen and can't stop playing. The story is deep not just some chucked together thing. There are plot twists, unexcpected events, and really well laid out plot lines. I don't want to give anything away so if you want to know about the story exeperience it for yourself. Trust me its worth it. Moving on to the gameplay. It is much approved over the first game. Shooting feels a lot more natural and the AI no longer has godlike accuracy (they still are pretty good shots). Comabt is sometimes challenging with the lack of ammo and sometimes numerous enemies. Stealth would be the prefered method in most situations simply because ammo is scarce and runs out quickly during firefights. The stealth in this is game is actually done very well. Enemies can't see you in the dark and will notice dead commrades and hear your footsteps if you run. Most weapons can silencers which is great for sneaking around but even then sometimes a missed shot or one the goes through your target and hits a wall can alert the others. So the stealth overall is well done. This game has mass imrpovements over Metro 2033 and really draws the player in with beautiful scenery and deep gripping story along with smooth well thought out sections and gameplay. 

Ok, so there are a few negatives I had with the game. The biggest thing is that ranger mode is DLC. That was a core part of Metro 2033 and the fact that the devs removed it and made it paid for DLC is upsetting. Ranger mode lets you really have an in depth experience by making the game much more difficult by making ammo even more scarce, enemies more challenging, and some other things which I can't remember on the spot. Another issue I had was there was one thing with the stealth mechanic that kind of hurt the immersion. There are times when there are enemies by lights that you can blow out/turn off and you can walk right up behind the enemy turn off the light and they don't do anything. It left me confused as to why an person wouldn't notice a light going out right next to them and it brings away from the realism/immersion. I also ran into a bug at one part where the game would keep crashing for some reason or freeze but then after a while work and be fine. But this was only at one point so not a big deal. Other than that there is nothing else I can really think of that I disliked about the game. Wait one more thing, there are times when in some of the stations of the metro where things break away from the feeling that you are in hummanities last place of existence and are barely making it by. I won't say what is going on to keep out spoilers but the things hurt the imersion factor. Ok, done with negatives.  

Overally Metro Last Light is a great exerpeince. The game is beautiful and well thought out and the gameplay mechanic is very smooth comapred to the previous title. There were a few gripes I had with it but nothing major. I haven't played the DLC so I don't have a comment on them. I would recommend picking this up for anyone who loves a game with a deep imersive story and an atmosphere that really pulls you in. For sure get this game if it is on sale, and if you have the money and are looking for something new, pick it up for its full price of $40. Just make sure you have a pc that can run because it is very demanding and would probably not run on a lot of buget machines.",1388780350,1388780350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The lower number of surface sections means that going on the surface has far less urgency than its predecessor, and its story is overall much worse. While it is understandable that a game based in the Moscow subway system is a linear rail shooter, the game could do better to at least hide it somewhat. Large parts of the game are spent being forced to follow ai at a slow pace and waiting for them to follow their scripted actions to open up new parts of the level. Frustratingly, at least 3 times in the game the ai failed to do this, and I was forced to reload the game.

Parts on the surface have schizophrenic level design at best, which is exacerbated by a lack of journal, vocal or contextual  based clues to progress in many parts of the game.

Narratively speaking, the game is far better earlier in the game than it is in the latter sections. The ending(s) feel rather tacked on, and sudden. The game implements a hidden morality system which works on a points based system to determine which ending you get. Find certain objects, play random instruments, and perform certain actions to gain morality. Killing people and making 'less moral' decisions will make you lose morality, and gain the 'bad' ending.

Oddly, the 'bad' ending, is better than the 'good' ending in a narrative sense. The 'good ending' also is likely to require the use of a guide to achieve. Essentially, like many other games, the addition of the moral choice system has only served to detract from the narrative and (to those who wish to acquire the 'good ending') the gameplay of the game. Further iterations of the series should look to the Witcher Series if it wants to implement a proper morality system, rather than tacking something on.

Despite all this, the sections of the game where you have to deal with human enemies are decent. Ammo is not so scarce as to make gunbattles a bad idea all the time, and stealth is an equally viable option. Unfortunately, much of the game is spent fighting mutant enemies, which are rather unenjoyable in comparison, especially as scripted events prevent stealth from being useful in these sections.

With tesselation set to the highest level, the environments and character models lose their rough polygonal appearance and elevate the visuals to something like a pre-render, which is way ahead of the majority of current games that include token tesselation which is either insufficient or poorly optimised.

The story was very interesting and I was intrigued to read the original fiction behind the video games by Dmitry Glukhovsky. There are enough flashbacks to the first game in the series, Metro 2033, that you don’t need to play it to enjoy Metro Last Light but there are callbacks to the earlier game that series fans will enjoy. The shooting mechanics were improved from 4A Games earlier Metro 2033 game but still not as great as some other FPS games I’ve played on Steam recently. I finished the game mostly because of the atmosphere and story and less because of the gameplay. 

I recommend anyone who enjoys game with atmosphere (Bioshock) or games that share a grittiness often found in games from Eastern European and Russian developers (S.T.A.L.K.E.R.) to purchase Metro Last Light. It often is discounted during Steam Sales.

It does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of the novels, from the let's-pull-together camraderie of the independent stations to the ideological zeal of the fascists and Reds to the horror of being stalked through a pitch-black labyrinth by unseen monstrosities.
The NPCs (friendly and otherwise) are imbued with individual personalities, lending variety and flavor to encounters.
The variety and customizability of weapons is a nice way to change and improve their feeling and behavior throughout the game.
Additionally, 4A and Deep Silver were awesome enough to bring Metro: Last Light to Linux!

I've never played another game like Last Light, save for its predecessor Metro 2033. The decaying ruins of Moscow are dark and gritty and really give you a feeling of the grim reality of day to day life in the Metro.

Gameplay is solid, guns are fun and feel good to shoot. One of the things I really liked was the attention to detail, in the world and in the gameplay. My favorite gameplay detail is your gas mask can get dirty, and can be manually cleaned with a wipe of your hand. The levels themselves are unbelievably detailed, and I really got a sense of a world once lived in and now dead.

DLC missions are kind of a letdown. Most of them are pretty short, and some of them give the impression that they were meant to be longer, but then the devs pushed out what they had and called it a day. I'd get them on sale.

With every step you take, you really start to feel the environment as if you were in it. Don't be surprised if you find yourself turning around frantically because you heard footsteps or shutting off your flashlight so the horde of monsters will pass, leaving you unnoticed. Although the whole game gives you a linear experience overall, you don't always notice it due to the amazing detail put in the metro's people and atmosphere. This game is also a survival game. Being smart and stealthily taking enemies down without the use of a gun or just ignoring them at all by using hidden vents to circle around to the next area is probably going to save your life later in the game. In some instances, I found myself with a couple bullets going against strong mutant creatures running around looking for spare ammo left on the floor.

The graphics is astounding with the details. The story is wellwritten, Dmitrij Gluchovskij, the author of the Metro books helped the developers in writing the story.

Love the gameplay and the guns, the monsters and characters are nice. Totally recommend this game!

The story does not follow the Metro books, the story in the game is taking a different path of the whole thing so it will not ruin the experience of reading ""metro 2034: The defence of Sevastopolskaja"" 

The only downside I have with this game is the fact that the ranger difficulty is a DLC rather than an update. It was free in Metro 2033, so why not in last light? The ranger difficulty gives a true immersion in the game, removes the HUD and the crosshair and personally it gives you the maximum visual experience!

I got the DLC 66% off, so 1,69€ only. It's kinda silly that they want you to pay 5€ for a difficulty level. However, winter sale was in my favor so I saved the money!

Positive Comments: The game looks gorgeous, even on low graphics settings, and the world is extremely well put together. Every environment is crafted with care, and there are tons of nice details. My experience playing on Ranger mode is that the gunplay is solid, and the scavenging is well executed - you are usually rewarded for exploring, and there are tons of nooks and crannies to look in. The story is decent, picking up where the last game left off.

Negative Comments: there are a lot of stealth sections, and stealth is hilariously easy. The AI is deaf and blind, as long as you are standing in a bit of shade. Weapon customization makes you want to hold onto a few weapons, but ammo limitations force you to use whatever you can find, leaving upgraded guns behind. On Ranger mode, there is literally no way of knowing how much ammunition you have, until you're out and can't reload.

But certain aspects of the story and game sort of dulled the game for me and others I can say. For one, Artyom's watch is different in this game than it was in 2033, why? So that the stupid 5 year olds can understand that ""BLUE LIGHT: ON. I CAN BE SEEN""

None of us want our games dumbed down for the younger gamers who play games outside of their age ratings. It's almost like EA and their DRM, they punish the legit consumer whilst dumbing down games punishes the target market of the game (18+)

A lot of things were changed that killed the game. As I said before, the watch. But I guess it's 'ok' so I don't mind that much (Although 2033's watch showed the IRL time which was pretty cool, i think this one does too but im not sure)

Secondly, the reload speeds and things like putting your gasmask on. Why was this changed? They've sped it up so damn much the sounds are un-sync'd with the actions! I don't understand it.


Something else that bugged a lot of people: Ranger mode. Now, ranger mode, in my opinion, is the best way to play the game. It certainly was in 2033, your lack of money therefore bullets reflected the harsh world that the bookwriter ""Dmitry Glukhovsky"" Wanted to create (If none of you knew, Dmitry worked on both games as creative consultant.. Yeah, I know.)

Ranger mode on 2033 was HARD. And it was supposed to be! I kept having to restart the [i]whole game[/i] because I ran out of filter time at the end or bullets. It was a fun experience, I didn't mind restarting the game because I get to play all the wonderfully detailed levels all over again. (And by detailed, I'm talking about Crysis level detail without the horrendus slapping it does to your G-card, CPU or framerate)

Ranger mode in LL is so freaking easy. I'm not even joking. A lot of the levels where you can stealth, I was literally done with in about 2 minutes. And the ammo you pick up? In areas with humans I found myself not being able to pick up ammo [i]because I had already hit the max ammo limit![/i]

Speaking of ammo. The areas where you fight only mutants. I found myself with absolutely 0 ammo left after these sections, occasionally having to restart from a checkpoint to get some headshots in and save ammo. On Ranger mode it takes ~10 bullets to kill 1 nosalis, yet in 2033 it took 2 to the body at the most. I don't get this? Why change something that isn't broken!

Speaking of that, they killed the graphic feel of the game for me. I really can't believe they changed it that much. Yes i know that 2033 came out in 2010 but for gods sake. 2033 looks better than LL.

Regardless of the graphics and overall feel and atmosphere. LL is an 'ok' sequel to 2033. I personally would have the old style graphics brought back along with the original speeds for reloading and the original watch. Small aspects like this are important to the fans of the original 2033 that actually care about game quality. I've spoken with a few of my friends and they agree.


Overall, Metro: Last Light was a let down. They put scenes in the game which were not needed at all (Venice, you all know what I'm talking about.) and seemed like a desperate attempt attempt at attention. A lot of minor tweaks killed the gameplay for me, and if you play the game and see how quick Artyom puts on his gas mask now, and compare it to 2033, you'll end up thinking ""Why?"" Just as I have.

If you really enjoyed 2033 (as you should, the game was near perfect) you sould play this, it puts an end to the story line, despite the ending lacking a little bit (it seems like they want to make another game) and some things not tied off.

(Ps, why did they change the character models so god damn much. I couldn't even recognise Miller let alone Khan.)


If i had to give a score, It'd be 5/10. Why? Because they changed the game so much in a way that spoils what it's supposed to be about, ranger mode is so easy vs humans and rediculiously hard vs mutants for no reason compared to 2033, and they changed the watch (how do you change the watch. [i]why would you change the watch[/i] i liked that watch.)",1388489691,1388489691,False,1,0,0.443486690521240234,0,True,False,False

If you're looking for a flawless first-person action game, you may want to consider looking elsewhere. I'm not saying the gameplay is horrible, it just has a few mechanical issues that keep it from being very good.

First, let's take a look at the weapon system that is implemented into the game. The ability to customize weapons with different upgrades is pretty neat, and adds a little more excitement, but the downside is that you don't get many chances to get these upgrades throughout the game, so if you want something specific for your gun, you'll have to hope one of the enemies drops a weapon with that upgrade, or you find a weapon on the ground with upgrades you like. The currency with which you buy these upgrades is pre-war military grade ammunition. In addition to weapons and upgrades, you can also purchase regular ammunition and throwable weapons with your military grade ammo. You'll occasionally have the option to give some military ammo to people who are homeless, or need help with something, or they want to give you a lap dance, and there's a little shooting minigame in one of the areas, but aside from that, there isn't much use for the stuff other than upgrading weapons and buying ammo and supplies. You can always load it into some of your guns, for a little extra firepower, but you're shooting your money, so unless you don't care about buying stuff, or lap dances, I would suggest holding off on using it in your guns until later in the game.

Now for general gameplay. You can play most sections of this game in a couple of different ways. The first being your normal, every day first person shooter. Run through, shoot everything that shoots at you, and get on with life. The other way, which I prefer, and I think the game does very well, is the stealth way. You can sneak through most areas of the game, which makes for a lot more interesting game in my opinion. The stealth mechanics are pretty basic, but good. You can hide in shadows, a blue indicator on your wrist watch will inform you if you're visible in the light, or hidden in the shadows. When in the shadows, you are completely invisible, even if an enemy is standing two feet away, and looking right at you, he won't see a thing. Take that as you want, some may see it as a negative, some may think it's fine, whatever. 

Now some issues I encountered... There were several times where I would hit checkpoints while in the middle of combat at low health. Dieing would just load me back to right before I died, and leave me to die again. There was another incident where the checkpoint happened while I was performing a back stab, and upon loading the checkpoint, the camera was stuck in one spot, and I had no control over anything. The camera was just static, and would not move at all. In both of these cases, I had to restart the chapter over again, which can be rather frustrating depending on how far into the chapter you are.

There were also a number of times where context sensitive promps would not appear for things like opening doors, turning out lights, or melee takedowns. In the case of melee takedowns, sometimes when the prompt did appear, pressing the melee key for a stealth kill would trigger the normal melee attack, which would often times either not kill the enemy, and alert the room, or kill the enemy and still alert the room.

Overall, it's a decent game, and while I wouldn't pay the full price for it as it is, with the buggy checkpoint system and a few other little bugs, the story is well worth it, if it goes on sale and you have the extra cash....

I like to be different, and so I'm going to rate this game on an ""S/A/B/C/D/F"" scale, where F  would be something worth less than the space it takes up on your hard drive, and S is something that you would play anytime, anywhere... something so great, that you may as well pretend S doesn't exist, since the only games worthy of that rating, weren't released this century. So, in the case of Metro: Last Light, I'm going to give it a C...  If you really want a number though: 3/5",1388443633,1388443633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Stealth is now trivial on the highest difficulty, and you have the ability to incapacitate enemies without killing them. Remeber, kids: challenge is bad.

Unpleasent changes aside, the story is severely lacking the feeling of 2033 and feels rushed. 4A sold out in order to make one last game, and it shows. There are certain parts of ""fanservice"" that really distract from the game, and instead try to ram the ""beautiful graphics"" in your face. 2033 is dead, and Last Light killed it. 

Final verdict: Don't buy Last Light looking for an artistic, story-driven experiance like 2033. This is another lame FPS in the tired spirit of games like call of duty and FEAR 3.",1386177695,1388435986,False,32,0,0.554311633110046387,4,True,False,False

Buying this before playing Metro 2033? Get 2033 and play it, than play this. You will appreciate the story line AND EVERYTHING ELSE so much more. It will also clear things up.
It is so easy to get caught up in the story. 
Also buy the book Metro 2033 don't get 2034, it sucks. Just kidding, its ok but kinda lame.

As far as game play, it is good. Nothing revolutionary but it does FPS very good. Standard from your storyline shooters.
It just has an above average storyline.

Don't care about storyline? Wouldn't recommend it.

One of the few games that does a good sequel. I am very picky and easily disapointed.

TLDR: Good gameplay, Great story. Buy Metro 2033 to full appreciate the story. Good seuel. This is all opinion.

there is a very low tech feel to allmost everything in the game, from weapons to tools, bringing some interesting twist into navigating and combat. 
The game its very linear and you get forced from time to time to play for a very short time, just to set up a story twist or point, so you sometimes get the feeling of watching a game instead of actually playing it.  

Allmost all levels have been constructed so that it is possible to sneak by the enemies or to choose a head on attack and it balanced both things very nice; it rarely seems like there are only 1 way of getting from start to end on a level, except for surtain events where you have to do it 1 specific way. Even though the levels (for the most) aint that big, the game still manage to give off the illussion of an open world game where exploring (where possible) does get reward.

The overall graphic style is dark, worn down and gritty and for the most part very stunning to look at, especially the level on the surface. Most of the time you'll be underground and even though its tunnel after tunnel after tunnel, it never seems redundant, cause of a very clever use of backgrounds and scenery.

Enemy AI does seem dumb from time to time, rushing towards the place you where last hear/spottet, without much selfpreservation. The overall intelligens does ramp it up quite a bit whern they are in groups though and thats where the fun starts!

The story is dark and enganging and well played out, so the character does really seem alive, apart from a few screw ups here and there, where characters reacts illogical. Sad, cause that's what stopped me from getting totally enganged in the otherwise cool story.

Didnt played the first game for a very long time, before I gave up on it, but it seems like the programmers have fine tuned the overall gameplay in a better direction. 
Overall a nice game, worth the price - but watch it with the dlc, does seem like a ripp-off..

The Good:  Metro: Last Light is a great game that actually manages to keep everything we knew and loved alive about the first: lots of killing or lots of stealth (your choice), lots of hidden stashes of goodies to find and a great ending; both the “good” and “bad” ending are worth the play through.  The economy of old world bullets being both your high damage ammo and your money is a fantastic idea and easily the most fun economy in any FPS out there.  The music in this game is fantastic, the engine felt crisp and responsive, the level design is good and the guns in the game really fit the jury-rigged feel of the technology in the metro cities.

The Bad: This game is not bug free.  The game accidentally switches between standard and military grade rounds (and yes I know how to switch rounds, I was not doing it on accident).  The game had a deep freeze on me once.  If you change your key bindings some actions won’t change.  If, for example, you change F to anything other than the standard binding you have to restore the defaults to sell items.  The game is also a little short; I went from start to finish in 14 hours.  Lastly, I felt that hard mode really kind’a … wasn’t.  They take away your reticle and you get no HUD but air filters, ammo, health kits, etc. are so plentiful it seemed that I didn’t really need to keep track.

The Funky:  This game had more nudity than just about any other game that was not explicitly for adults (granted most of the nutidy is in the brothel so ... yeah ... what did I expect).  They didn’t overdo it so it was neither good nor bad in most cases but there’s one time you talking to this chick and one tit just sorta … creeps out to say hi, I got a laugh.  Also, the things the guards say when they don’t know you’re there are cliché but funny; things like “man, I sure hope today is not the last day of my life” or “man, do you ever get the feeling that someone is right behind you.”

The Verdict:  One a scale of 1 to 10, I’d give Metro: Last Light a solid 8.  I enjoyed the first one a little bit better but the second kept everything I loved, kept me interested, felt good to play and gave me a good ending for my work.

I could go on about this game endlessly, but the main thing is that you'll need a powerful gaming PC to enjoy this how it's meant to be experienced.

I had very high expectations for this game, and I've been rewarded with most of them. First of all, it has definitely rounded off some of 2033's rough edges. Gameplay feels faster and more responsive, graphics are quite different but look absolutely stunning and the performance is much better. This is all great news, but there's one slight flaw; that the actual spirit of the previous game isn't quite there anymore. Sure, the slight clunkiness and sheer difficulty were turn-offs for many people, but it did give the game its own charm. Another criticism is the disappointing voice acting. Metro 2033's voice acting wasn't all that spectacular either, but it had it's charms and occasional pants-pissingly hilarious quotes from everyone's favourite Uncle Bourbon. In other words, this game is more accessible and performs better than its predecessor, but that's just not what the old Metro 2033 veterans were waiting for.

SPOILERS AHEAD

The story goes that in 2013, nuclear war decimated most of civilization, and only ones who survived were those in the Moscow subway system when the bombs went off. You play as Artyom, a ranger in the metro. In the last game, Artyom launched a missile strike against a race of seemingly hostile mutants called the Dark Ones. However it turns that the Dark Ones were making an attempt to communicate with the humans. Throughout the course of this game, you attempt to track down the last remaining Dark One, which brings to light a brewing conflict between the factions of the metro.

SPOILER FREE FROM HERE

As far as gameplay goes, it is mainly stealth based when fighting human enemies. Most of the levels are fairly dimly light, and you are able to turn off many light sources. This helps greatly, as you are almost completely undetectable when you are in the dark. A nice addition is that your watch has an indicator as to whether you are visible or not. You also have a choice of killing or knocking our enemies, but I have not found a difference between the two other than the animation. 

When fighting mutants, the game becomes more survival-horrorish, with ammo being scarce and enemies hiding in the shadows. Gameplay becomes very similar to Alan Wake, as using your flashlight can ward off and expose the weak spots of baddies.

There are a few sections of the game which take place on the surface. These usually consist of you being beaten to a pulp by mutants. Many of these areas also suffer from terrible level design. One such level, in which I had to collect gasoline to power a tram, was almost impossible to navigate, as much of it is covered in water, and you are unable to swin past falling into water and pulling yourself back out. This can become very disorenting, as you pull yourself back onto the ledge from which you fell off without turning around, leaving you wondering if you climbed onto the ledge in front of you.

In terms of weaponry, the game keeps it pretty simple. Pistols, shotguns, assault rifiles, SMGs, and sniper rifiles are your choices, although I almost never found myself in a situation where a sniper would be useful. All of these weapons can be customized with a variety of attachments, some of which being a little ridiculous. At one point in the game, I found a quadruple-barreled shotgun. All of the items in the game are bought with military-grade ammunition, which can be used for your weapons in a pinch.

All in all, Metro: Last Light is a generally well done first person shooter with a few inherent flaws. 

I give it an 8 out of 10.",1388116987,1388116987,True,6,0,0.605809152126312256,0,True,False,False

I think Metro: Last Light is an excellent example on where modern gaming stands these days. The emphasis is firmly on special effects such as graphical gimmicks and music, while the story elements are left hanging. Just the exposition in the early parts of the game makes it feel like you're a 5-year-old being led around by the nose, and this is even kind of lampshaded by one of the characters. Things like an achievement for completing the basic training -- Just what goes on in the mind of a game developer that puts something like that in their game? The world itself is very rich, and the artists have done a great job bringing it into an interactive form, but I'm amazed at how badly executed storytelling passes as alright for commercial games up to this time and age. This is more of a critique towards games in general, and it's what I think needs to be overcome before the general public can start treating games as a form of art. However, compared to other modern games Metro: Last Light does very well for itself.",1387994903,1387996841,False,1,0,0.463749438524246216,0,True,False,False

It has a good amount of free-roam feel and choose-your-own-methods while at the same time keeping linear and progressive in story. It has a better-explained story than the first Metro game, I thought, as your character Artyom knows his mission as he narrates it between chapters. It also brings a lot of closure to said game. For those who have not played Metro 2033, the prior game is not necessary as its events are explained (and even re-visited) sufficiently that Last Light can stand on its own. There really are four kinds of game modes you play: Safe areas where you casually roam around and take in the environment; Room-by-room vs hostile humans situations that can be solved by either direct gunfighting or by stealth; chapters where an ally is accompanying you, and wildlands areas both on the surface and underground where you encounter unorganized monsters. The AI of humans is particularly realistic. Every single individual has unique behaviors and things they can be overheard saying. A stealth play-through allows a player to particularly appreciate this. Once they are in aggro, they know their home ground and where to fall back on, and if they get impatient they will move out as a group. They do not posess x-ray vision and it is still possible to employ sneaky surprises even after they are on high alert. All in all, my experience with the main game has been positive. I am a deep immerser and enjoy experiencing a story and nothing really spoiled my mood. The artistic side of the game is beautiful and makes me wish every game had this much attention to detail; there are virtually no recycled assets and every area has unique things to look at that are all relevant and sensible to be there. To people who go through games like they read through a book, this one is a must-read. To people who like a good think-on-your-feet first-person adventure reminiscent of Half-Life 2, this is right up your alley as well. I hear that speed-runners get a good challenge out of it, but I'm a much more slow-moving person. My dilligence in searching everywhere rewards me frequently with hidden stashes. Anyways, Metro: Last Light has very quickly ascended to the ranks of my top ten all-time favorite games.

Set in a post-apocalyptic Russia where factions of people, including communists and Nazis, are forced to fight for territory underground because of the demons that stalk the surface. A delapitated environment represents the state of mind of the people living in it. The game is rich with characters and you find yourself enjoying the company of old friends from Metro 2033. The combat is not made for multiplayer and one tends to feel heavily burdened by movement and lack of air because the developers strived for realism. It's a classic PC first-person action/stealth game where you must use bullets to survive the nightmarish demons above, but below you have the option of not shooting any enemy humans and maneuvering through the underground bases in complete stealh-mode. The only reason I don't give this game an 8 or 9 is because of some of the ally AI, which may or may not be because I'm playing on a Mac, albeit a powerful Mac. When you are limited to minutes of air on the surface and your ally Pavel gets stuck multiple times in multiple spots saying ""Follow me."" but not moving, you can't help but get frustrated when you run out of air and try to move Pavel or even shoot him to budge while coughing to your death.

43160,8236186,76561198059746738,0,9,1562,0,1166,1389394145,"I'll start with what Metro: Last Light does well.  The first thing you'll notice is that the game looks beautiful.  The lighting effects are among the best I've ever seen.  Animations for man and beast are done well.  The environments are well crafted.  Also, the gun play is good (when you actually get to shoot something).

That brings me to Last Light's weak points, of which there are many.  First, the game is very short.  It will take you about 10 hours to complete the game.  There is nothing to extend the playthrough much longer as this game is painfully linear.  The ""exploration"" in this game consists of looting side rooms along the tunnel.  These areas are painfully obvious because they are all located along your narrow, predetermined path.  Don't even try to think for yourself while playing this game.  If you see something that you think is an alternate path or a secret then think again.  This game doesn't have secrets or alternate paths.  There are invisible walls all over the place.  At first I was engrossed in the atmosphere, but that quickly faded as the first two hours of the game is all tutorial and hand holding.  You follow around diferent AI ""tourguides"" and occasionally you get to flip a switch or even engage an enemy.  Hopefully your AI buddy doesn't wind up frozen or spazing out in the corner because it breaks the scripting and you have to restart the entire chapter.  Iit happened to me twice, I tried restarting the checkpoint but it didn't fix it in either case.  When you are finally free from your AI hand holders it doesn't get much better.  The game takes controll away from you all the time.  It even has times during the cutscenes where you have to mash the 'E' key to live.  Luckily this happens only a few times but it means that you can't simply enjoy the cutscenes because a prompt might show up.  Possibly the worst aspect of the game play is the AI and the ""stealth"" mechanic.  Early in the two hour tutorial section you're told that the blue light on your watch indicates whether or not you can be seen.  You wouldn't think that it means that if the light on your watch is off that you're completely invisible.  However, that's precisely how it works.  If you are in direct light you can be seen from across the room (that's fine, make sense).  However if you are not directly lit you can stand right in front of an enemy.  The human enemies are apparently deaf as well.  You can stab somebody through the throat with a buddy standing a couple of feet away and they don't hear the gurgling or the death grunt.  You have throwing knives which are a one hit stealth kill no matter where they hit.  Ememies often walk right by dead bodies and pay them no mind.  I ended up just going Rambo through most of the encounters because taking the stealth approach is boring and requires no skill.  In between some missions you stop at Metro stations which are like shanty towns where survivors live.  These serve as exposition and as a means to reequip yourself.  While I found the Metro Stations to be beautifully crafted, the whole thing felt like the ""It's a Small World"" or ""Pirates of the Caribean"" Disney rides.  You go down the path and watch the ""animatronic"" characters act out their scenes.  The large Metro station with the nudie bar was nice as there are a couple of side activities, but otherwise I didn't feel like these segments added much to the game.  I felt the story and character developement were weak and I'll leave it at that as this review is already way too long.

Ultimately, this game contains many elements that I detest in games.  It's overly linear, it takes control away from the player way too often, it has quicktime events during cutscenes, there are several uninspired turret sections, the stealth mechanic is broken beyond belief, and the human AI is laughably bad.  Metro: Last Light is more of an interactive cinematic experience than a game.  If you enjoy such experiences and don't mind a very short campaign you will probably love Metro: Last Light.  Otherwise just watch a playthrough on YouTube.  There's not much gameplay so you won't be missing much.  It's too bad because I can tell a lot of hard work went into this game.  There is a lot of talent on display.  It's just too bad that the mechanics fall flat.

-----

I played this trough without the ranger dlc on hardcore difficulty. On occasion I found the sneaking was a little bit too easy. But it wasn't really a big thing. Lot was saved by the fact that the human enemies are very good at firefights and I did get my ass kicked on couple of instances. I did get a feeling that there was a price to be paid for failing in stealty approach.

Second thing I wan't to mention is that the game took my controls away from me for too many times. I liked the half-life 2 way of doing thigs. You would never be forced to look on some specific location just so the game could tell you some small details of the story. On Metro: Last Light I was simply interrupted at the middle of advancing trought a section of a game without any good reason. Like there was a time when a demon lifted me off the ground and other instances similar to that. These didn't add to my experience or scare me. Nor did they happen because I let some monster get too close to me. Maybe for the first and second time they affected me. But for the most parts they were just stupid annoyances where I could not die. Is it supposed to increase my sense of danger when I'm given situations where I cannot die. ""Tap E key quickly""... Yeah thats really difficult. I wonder if I can manage that. And why would I get scared when the ladder i'm climbing breaks under me when the game has thaught me that I will survive and probably don't have to press a single key to do that.

I mostly did not like the parts where I was on the surface. Mainly because of the gasmask filters. At the beginning I did run out of them and just barely got safely to underground after dying five times. I did look for the filters before that but didn't just find them. Other possibility is that I changed my whole mask few times and lost lots of gasmask time because of that. As a result of this I killed almost every human enemy in the game so I would not run out of the stupid filters. I would have bought them, but they are not sold. I quess I lost some of the stress and sense of horry on surface when I reached a point where I had filters for 25 mins or more.

For me this was not a survival horror game. At the start of the game it did have some scary moments, but at the middle of the game I got accustomed to them and they didn't really affect me anymore. This is a problem with most games in the scary games genre, so in that way Metro: Last Light has nothing to be ashamed of. So if the horror part is ok, how about the survival part? After the very beginning there just wasn't a bad need for more ammo or money. I found pretty much all the weapons I used in the game. I think I only bought the semi-automatic shotgun which was a great purchase as it is the best non silenced weapon in the game. Most of the time I used that crappy metro-made assault riffle with IR sight and a silencer. The only time I ran out of ammo wasn't because I would have done something badly or lazily. I don't remember running out of assault riffle ammo and for certain I didn't have to shoot my money. Perhaps on Ranger Mode DLC there would be a less ammo, money and usable weapons.

I found the story to be interesting at the start. But after the mystery and secrets were for the most parts revealed, It didn't interest me anymore. They were revealed too early for my taste. There was still lot of game left when I already knew most of the enemy plans.

These negative thigs did take away from my experience, but by no means is it a bad game. It might be the best looking game I have ever played, and that is despite the fact that I didn't use the best settings. The light effect look fantastic and work flawlesly with the sneaking game mechanics. The sneaking while being little bit too easy is still very much fun. Shooting mechanics have a great feel which is supported by good sound effects. The levels on underground sections of the game are good looking and because they were tunnels I didn't care that they were almost completely linear, but the surface I felt like my movement had been severy limited and I often just wanted to pass trough those parts of the game. While the game wasn't scary for the entire length of my playtrough. It did have a great atmosphere with sense of immediate danger. After being long times on surface or some dark abandoned tunnels, it gives a sense of relief and safety when you reach a non-hostile metro station with music, laughter and lots of light.

It is not the best fps game made, maybe not even the best one released in 2013. But it certainly is a great game and worth purchasing for every fan of the genre. I recommend increasing your fov before you start playing. I think you have to do this manyally from files. Google for a guide.

Gameplay: Mostly like the in previous game, yet solid. You can mostly choose how you play (stealth or open combat). There is autoheal but it's not overpowered like in similar games, making the game more difficult.

Graphics/Sound: The graphics quality is mindblowing. The game could easily compete with Battlefield 3/4 and others, the only thing which could use some improvement are the animations. The sound is quite subtile but always suits the right situation.

Not to mention they're nickle and diming you for everything including a ""ranger mode"" (which isn't included in their season pass - lame).

I've literally been standing less than 3 meters from somebody when they would turn around, look right at me, and turn back around so I could jab my knife into their throat. Then the fact that you have only a handful of enemies to take down in the game is another shortfall. Off the top of my head I can confidently say there are less than a dozen unique enemies in the entire game. Also this game never lets you feel as if you're in control of anything. You encounter multiple cutscenes, ""Press E to live"" moments, and it starts to feel less like a game and more like a drawn out, poorly scripted movie.

Inspired by the novel Metro 2033; Last Light follows Artyom as he ventures through the Moscow tunnels to save both D6 and the metro itself while facing both man, monsters, and untold horrors of the metro. The story unfolds at a good pace with both surprising and obvious twists. Fans of 2033 will enjoy the story though those who haven't played it will find it slightly confusing with its references to the previous game.

Gameplay:
controls are tight and the mechanics of the stealth aspect have been streamlined to a simply visible or non visible light on your watch as per 2033's radius based 3 stage watch which in some scenarios of Last Light felt odd that i was in a well light room and was unseen by the occupants. Controls are the same as the last game with some of the guns feeling a bit less unwieldy (understandable since Artyom is now a veteran of such weapons). You now carry less weapons and are limited in how much ammo you can carry putting a nice emphasis on accuracy and sneak or fight scenarios. Another positive note is there is less following stages in which the now experienced Artyom is left to fend for his own. With this improvement also comes the expansion of different environments to survive throughout the game. Overall the game continues to keep up with its predecessor in making the game fun and a nice hardcore break from the common shooters; one additional note is that Last Light ramps up both the action at a great pace and at some points I found to provide more terrifying moments then 2033.

Graphics:
The game looks beautiful pushing any computer and its graphics cards to its limits.  Even better on 3 screens (surround/eyefinity) and 3D the game is absolutely gorgeous.

Sound:
The voice over work is a small step up from 2033 but the monsters, guns, and environment feel top notch adding to the atmosphere and dare I say beauty of a ravaged and destroyed Moscow.

Replay:
The game provides a good chance of replay with 2 endings depending on both your traditional and its unique good and bad decisions. If your willing to cough up a little extra cash the DLC provides a few more hours of experience. For those that played 2033 returning to the depths of the Metro was always fun.

Overall:
This is a strong sequel to a unique and great cult game favoring story and atmosphere over action hero style gameplay. Metro veterans know what they are in for if their computer can handle it",1387502939,1387502939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Was such a step up from the previous Metro in nearly all aspects of gameplay. And as usual gives players the post apocalypse atompshere we wish all games under this genre had. The graphics, lighting and the landscape all complement each other to create a immersive world for the player. Even going so far as to make you wipe junk off your gas mask when your outside it is by far the best single player post apocalypse experience I have ever had. Having said that however I do believe this game could have done with some more oh shit moments which I felt were missing or maybe it's just because giant shrimp and bears just don't do it for me? I played through the game twice and never saw a liberian and it really bugged me because those guys scared the shit out of me in the first game and when I came across one I felt like running in the other direction. (Until I learnt I could kill them with 4 throwing knives to the head but thats beside the point)

Would deffiently advise playing Metro 2033 if you haven't before playing this game to get that story aspect it makes the game much clearer or Alternatively grab the book it's also a great read. The story and characters provide you with a compelling story thats hard not to just keep on with. Aside from the obvious story aspect Last light also introduced diffrent game mechanics allowing players to throw knives and things with a hot key (Makes throwing knives like 20x more fun to use)

Another great game with an intense atmosphere, beautiful level designs, improvements made to the gameplay.  I felt like the boogie man sneaking around in levels against humans, and then I felt helpless and scared when in levels against mutants where they were sneaking around on me.  The elements of light, new weapons, diary pages to further the story, the visuals all lend to an amazing game.

My complaints are that they changed voice actors for the returning characters, a few invislble walls and some buggy levels/achievements/invisible walls.

The game is terrifying, interesting, heartwarming, sad, funny and lots of fun.  Great story, great gameplay, great visuals & environments.

DLC: 

-Ranger mode adds some needed difficulty to the game, but it's not as hard as 2033 and easier than a lot of other games.

-Faction pack: highly recommended.  1 good level (Sniper Team), 1 mediocre level (Heavy Assault) & 1 very awesome level (Kshatriya).

-Tower Pack is pretty crappy.  The first level is kind of hard, the last 4 levels were a joke.  Waste of time except for the achievements.

-Developer Pack has 1 good level with spiders & a flamethrower, and then a shooting gallery/arena with 10 repetitive challenges.  The achievement expects you to spend 3 hours in there, but even doing all the challenges & looking at the museum, you're done in an hour & 1/2.  This pack is only slightly better than Tower Pack because it does have 1 good level.

-Chronicles pack: this DLC actually has some relevant story to it unlike the other 3.  The Pavel level is good, takes place in Venice.  The Khan level is a flashback, sort of looks like a 2033 level, takes place after the train chase.  It's decent.  The Anna level takes place at the start of the game.  It's pretty short and mediocre, doesn't really add any new perspective despite having Artyom around.

It captures the landscape of post nuclear ""reality"" unlike any other game I've ever encountered. This game started to really get under my skin with some of the visual touches that are constantly scattered around the world (one small example was seeing a skeleton on a bus line holding the body of a childs skeleton). It's not a happy place to be. Survival in the cramped confines of the Metro is all anyone has to look forward to. 

While there is very much some of the standard fair of a first person shooter there is a story that drives the game forward and has had me playing one more level for several hours past the time I normally like to be asleep. I really enjoyed Metro 2033 and I feel that Last Light has surpassed it in almost every way while continuing the story of Artyom who is the main protagonist from the first game.

One thing that I am still struggling with is whether the shooting is an improvement or a downgrade. They ""fixed"" the shooting meaning that bullets that were made after the bomb has fallen will do less damage than pre-war bullets but wont be less accurate (at least that is how it feels). I actually felt that the somewhat unpredictable nature of the bullets in the 2033 added some authenticity to the feeling of that world. On a normal difficutly the shooting feels considerably more traditional shooter. It made the shooting part of the game more fun, but took away a little of the sense of dread with encounters. 

I don't think you need to play the first game to get pleasure out of this one but I would certainly recommend it as it still looks darn good. I would easily recommend Last Light as well. 

It is unfortunate (for me) that my favorite games tend to be THQ properties. I don't know how much work Deep Silver had to do on this game before they released it but I am hopeful that they can continue to do this property justice.",1387336208,1387336208,True,7,0,0.60052943229675293,1,True,False,False

The hidden moral point system and variable ending sequences are something to keep an eye out for. It is definitely not obvious . I tested the game in linux and noticed it struggling a bit.

Unfortunately I must have had one too many lap-dances/strip-teases to enjoy the ""Redemption"" ending, but I plan on going back and preventing as many negative moral point accumulations as possible. No multi-player, but thats not so much a negative as it is a positive, because the storyline is laden with prudent morality decisions influenced by player choices giving their ultimate ethic. Unlike most current FPS games, Metro does not provide a clear path to purity through handholding throughout the series with prompts and dialogues, but rather lets you choose your path and deal with the consequences as you would in real life. I appreciate the developer's tribute to nuances rather than the common ""shoot-em-up"" style, because now I have a reason to go back and make better choices regarding morality. Makes me wonder about the choices I've made and the choices I will make. All in all, I enjoyed the shit out of this game. When the Watchmen howl from the darkness as you traverse slowly through the environment the hairs on your body rise; they have either seen or heard you, and they want to end you.

Not only does Last Light improve on most of the faults of 2033 (Much better coding and optimisation, better gunplay, filters are easier to come by, easier time looting bodies, throwable items have a dedicated key and a dedicated stealthy takedown system Dishonored style) it is arguably the most visually stunning game there is for PC currently. Not only are the textures great but the way each area is presented is truly mind blowing. If I had to say one thing this game nails it would be the lighting. The way the lighting is cleverly used to illuminate the pitch black underground metro in each level will drop your jaw. You will wonder why other games have not put as much time and effort into lighting as Last Light has.

While I found the game to be highly immersive and emotional at times, I would suggest to those who are not comfortable with the mature themes in this game to have second thoughts about this. There are some very brutal scenes in here as well as partial nudity and sections with intense violence (It's an fps after all). Still if you think you can handle that I would still highly recommend this. Personally I found these parts to make the metro more realistic and believable (hence more immersive) but some may be turned away from it. Bear in mind that while I did not mind, the game can be quite linear and handholding at times. Personally I enjoy linear games just as much as open world games but you should consider this. Just remember to treat Last Light as something more than just your average fps if you are to enjoy it. This game can only be truly appreciated when you set yourself up in a dark room with your headphones and lose yourself to the people, the atmosphere and political turmoil going on within the metro.",1386913767,1386913767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game makes you feel more involved in the world than most, and the atmosphere and characters are half of what carries this game. The other half comes in the form of excellent gameplay. It plays sort of like a Deus Ex game in a way, giving you a hybrid of stealth and combat, and let's you handle most situations as you see fit. Last but not least, customization is greatly improved upon, at least in terms of weapons. You can greatly customize most of your loadout, with verything from sights, barrel mounts, magazines, the works. In the end, I really liked his game.

Firstly, since lots of people are, let's compare metro 2033 with Last Light just because. The AI in 2033 was awful, If you were stealthing, one enemy across the map would be shooting you while none of the other enemies were alerted, as well as i had to restart chapters MANY times because the NPC character who would lead me into the next area would just...stop. In 2033, the dialogue is even worse, they actually use a lot of the exact same voice actors in both games, but in LL you can actually hear the effort the VA's made into giving believable conversations life. I definitely agree with you on the faces part, Though it is a low budget game so face capture technology the likes of la noire would not be possible, and you should not discredit them for that. Yes, the ending did actually have many mini boss fights in a row which felt a little bit awkward fighting boss after boss, though they were not without context. LL has more gameplay too, and it isn't padded like it was in 2033 where every level is you fumbling around with a knife that does 0.1 damage because bullets are impossible to find until something scripted happens and then you do a quicktime event. If i were to bring up some negative things about LL i would definitely say that they need to improve the stealthing mechanics, you can stand off in the darkness and pop people off one at a time and not be noticed until they shine a flashlight on you and stare at you, whereas in 2033 they would just automatically detect you, or you would step on one of the billions of convenient piles of broken glass, and always be fighting instead. They should also add more moves into the boss battle arsenal, the rhino the giant mantis and the huge bear boss all have the exact same move set and weakness, and it feels like the same boss over and over.  I also did not enjoy the segments of the game where various light filters would be applied over my screen and i would just begin taking damage, or when the geiger meter was not making any noise that i would just become intensely irradiated and just lose my filter right away. The gas mask added tension and a looming sense of danger at the beginning of the game where filters were extremely rare and you had to make it an effort to just survive long enough for Pavel to finish talking so you can go, but about 3/4th of the way through the game i found myself with almost an hour's worth of air on hardcore, and i never had to worry about filters. Welp. even though LL has many flaws, it is by far a better game and I loved it.

I didn't see it anywhere in the reviews, else I would have passed on it. 

However, I came to see the game more as a challenge - not so much in terms of
gameplay, but moreso with regards to my own ability to manage my frustration.
Having player a tonne of FPS/RPG's over the years, I'm (at least *I* and my pals
think) I'm pretty saavy about figuring out ""stuff"" game wise. However, there are a
plethora of seemingly undecypherable ""things"" you're supposed to do, e.g. in the
final D6 chapter with the train, and other again, at least to me, seemingly 
untuitive elements that you need to either know, puzzle out, or simply have
to do, to survive. 

When I started playing, who knew there were ""Moral Points""?! And they determine
the final ending?! Would it really ruin the developers goals to tell the poor game
player about these - even if left to intuit what constitutes a ""moral"" vs ""IMmoral""
action, etc.?! I Don't Think So!!

There's a LOT I really like about this game: the loving care and planning put
into it, the execution, the art/graphics - you can see the passion invested
by the developers. Perhaps the elements that I found frustrating, and 
clearly intentional, were ""inspired"" by some of the dev team having been
Special Forces (RL) and thinking you should tough it out and ""man up"" 
to the challenge of the game (they do state the company/dev team is
made up of people that are self-taught and some with military backgrounds).

I cannot say that I regret playing it - and I now, having finished it, question 
if I would have missed something interesting and good, i.e. this game, if
I had not bought it and toughed-it-out to the finish. Now, having ""moral
points awareness"" will play it again (goddess help me) to experience
the Other Finale. I originally gave this a thumbs down - ""Do Not Recommend""
but upon completion, am changing it to recommend: there are too many
good/great elements that overshadow the bad/frustrating ones.

Lastly - not having read, nor heard of, any of the books this is based on,
have to say, that if there's any doubt as to how the world could end up
if we don't pull our global heads out of our collective asses, should be
required to play this - with the global BS still so prevelant worldwide,
it's really time to get our collective act together.

P.S. For some reason, perhaps OpenGL in Leenux (sic) - MetroLL
ran BETTER in Leenux then WinDoze. I'm not complaining and
wish ALL games should be developed for Linux. Ok, I can't
help but admit to being a UNIX/Linux ""snob""... But really, WinDoze
does suck ever so much!  :p",1386162743,1386568462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The absence of ridiculous augmented reality waypoints helps with this, while excellent environmental cues and lighting mitigate disorientation. Optional areas were designed with an admirable lack of signposting and some nice mutant ambushes thrown in to make things tense.

Despite the focus on exploring at your own pace, obsessing over weapon customizations and stealthing, the sense of forward momentum in the game is palpable. Stealth encounters against humans seem to make up about half of the game, but those bits are expertly mixed with bits where listen to conversations in inhabited areas, bits where you traverse and explore the surface, and horror bits both on the surface and underground.

The success of the stealth system seems like a ""less is more"" thing. Everything is solvable by messing with light sources, stalking enemies and seizing opportunities when enemies split up, while silenced weapons increase the player agency if you are prepared to get blood on your hands. All of this is designed without quick save in mind, which is always a bonus.

I first tried to go for the no kill achievement, but even as a do-gooder ranger, some opportunities with silenced weapons felt so natural (and sometimes deserved) that I had to take them. While other shooters often make you feel like a deranged mass murderer, Last Light allows you to be a very special brand of psychopath who doesn't kill indiscriminately. This might seem a bit silly, but I thought that it added to the immersion of being an elite warrior in a post apocalyptic world.

The sense of being present in the world is just ... fantastic. Some Starbreeze/DICE quality immersion at display in the game. Minimal HUD, condensation inside the gas mask, dirt that you have to wipe off on the outside, hearing yourself gasping for air, special animations when you are jumped by monsters and stressing over air filters and cracks in the gas mask are just the tip of the iceberg.

Gameplay: I like all the cool gimmicks this game throws at the players, like my gasmask. This game emphasizes on how CRUCIAL it is to survive with a gasmask. From constantly replacing filters, wiping my mask clean and replacing it if, it is cracked or, damaged. Recharging your light and other light sources, play a key role in the starting of the game, giving it the creepy ambiance that survival-exploration games offer. The game later opens up to a true FPS with the later chapters ending in large gun fights.


Synopsis *(Spoilers?)*:    The game starts out with the ending of the last game. You just activated the nukes to eliminate an alien race. Factions between the human race come up as the nuclear fallout makes the surface uninhabitable.The remaining supplies are scarce but word of a bunker known as ""D6"" is discovered, with the promise of an abundance of supplies. Factions scramble to take over D6 where friendships are lies, spies are everywhere and the people you thought you once knew are moles working for the other factions.

Background story: To me the story was not as great as I expected, the game plays with the main character ""Artyom"" a ""gifted"" human, with the power to link to the ""Dark Ones"", an alien race, and talk to them. Since he was a child and lost his mother, he could communicate with this alien race telepathically; through some mind altering connection he made as a child with an alien that saved his life.",1386548113,1386548243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A true software masterpiece. 
Blew my mind. You will definitely will not regret buying this game. (Especially if you played and loved Metro 2033).
The graphics, the atmosphere, everything in this game is unique and beautiful.
About the Story, what can i say? I never read any of Dmitriy Glukhovskiy's books (in the future, i will. For sure), but if the developers stayed faithful to his work, well, he is nothing less than a true genius. Few games made me feel like Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light did.

This means the player is rather confined to a very specific path, and that countless scripted events and cutscenes will guide your character through some of the most interesting plot points in the game. That being said, it doesn't feel like the gameplay was limited or diminished by the linear path nor the abundance of scripted events. Your hand will be held, but there is enough combat to satisfy. The ending, however, is abrupt as shit. The final battle is pretty easy and uninteresting, and the secret ""good"" ending is very tricky to attain, and that's if you already know about the Karma system from reading about it in some FAQ or forum. The atmosphere and visuals are outstanding, and the first two-thirds of the game will keep you engaged. The relationship between the main character and his love interest actually had me intrigued, but by the last third of the game, it basically amounted to nothing. Again, much of this was due to the abrupt ending and sticking too close to the Russian novel.

For reasons unknown the game has peformance issues with amd cards, and this is not only in my case it is a matter i have looked up on the web. While playing at a good fps it can in the middle of nowhere simply drop to 5-6 fps and it will stay at that amount until you go out of the game which is quit annoying since the game is checkpoint based meaning you will loose all you progress from the last checkpoint when you exit which is a serious problem that needs to be dealth with. Secondly that game also freezes quite often for about 1-2 second my in my experience this happen about every 5 minuts which is to say it nicely a real pain in the arse. Now even tho the game has problems that's only one side.
The game is abseloutly brilliant. Great game mechanics. stunningly good light effects. interesting enemies. incredibly immersive. good story. and much more. The genre is handled so well there is barely any hud in the game actually none if you play in ranger mode now there is an issue with ranger mode ill com to that later. As i said no hud but you still know how much ammo you got how much health you got back etc. which is quit fantastic that they managed to pull that off. the gunplay is really good, lots of ways to kill enemies some needs to be killed in certain ways and so on. now i have to say that the voices arent the best they mostly consists of russian voice actors trying to speak english which is not that good to be honest.
About the ranger mode the problem is you dont get ranger mode with the game its dlc you have to buy which i quite annoying. i dont want to buy that piece of dlc but its such an essential part of the game that you really need to buy it if you want to play the game as the developer wanted it to be played. 

All in all the game is really good but it has flaws that needs to be fixed especially the perfomance issues on the amd cards. Im not aware of any problems on nvidia side that is something you need to look into yourself

It will take you deep underneath the city of Moscow deep in the dark claustrophobic metro and open and deadly landscape of the city above.  Immersion in this game is at its finest. You have to watch every second of your timer to make sure how much time you have left in your gass mask filter, when your mask get covered in blood, water, muck, etc you are able to wipe it off without a problem, and you can burn up cobwebs slowing you down with your lighter. The combat in this game is more fast paced than in the last game but still has that old feel. As usual, it is always best to stealth your way through, but now you can run and gun without severe punishment like in the last game. The story still shares the morality system (aka good/bad ending system). but now its more harder to notice if you have done something wrong or right, it all depends on personal opinion. The story from time to time may have some immersion breakers(or destroyers) but its only once or twice. Such as (small spoiler) when you are tracking down your former friend in a metro station when suddenly you walk into a strip club with no reason, you just end up there without knowing why. If you played the first metro then you will already notice some of the old characters, some characters you will like, some you hate, and one that has a personality that just dosnt make sense. But in the end thats all there is, just a few problems here and there and a few immersion breakers but thats it. The story is still immersive and engaging.

If you haven't yet played Metro 2033, I recommend you start with that game. The game works on lower end machines, yet graphics still look great.

With Metro: Last Light, there were a few moments when continuity wasn't exactly a strength in the game. At points, th game play would go from sneaking around traps and enemies to a gimmick based boss fight that seemed impossible. Some times you were given VO clues, sometimes those VO clues could be confusing and I sought help via walk through or forum posts.

There is a great deal of resource management in Last Light that can really hurt your game later. Unlike other games where you can hide and take out enemies one at a time with a melee attack, if you run out of ammo in Last Light during a fight, you are pretty much going to die.  Also, there is extensive use of gas masks that require new filters every few minutes. Run out of filters--you die. These type of punitive design issues really make you scavenge and eventually add to immersion. You learn to pick your fights when they can be avoided (don't attack flying creatures, they are a waste of ammo).

One of the game's strengths is story telling via immersive environments, much like Metro 2033. The underground populated areas stand out as some of the more memorable moments in the game.  

The overall story of Last Light seemed good at first, then I sort of lost track in the middle and was hooked for the last 4 or so hours. It is worth noting that the story gets a bit adult later when it includes a bit of expertly textured nudity.",1386096074,1386096074,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's more refined,  some may say ""toned down"" but I found it flowed better with what was going on.  The game feels less clunky.    The gun modifications are useful,  night vision sights are a godsend in the dark.    And it forces you to adapt your playstyle based on what you're facing.   Stick to the dark when you're against human beings,  but light is your best friend when the monsters come out to play.    You can go from prey to predator and back to prey in a matter of minutes depending on the level.    Did I mention the game looks fantastic.   A really unique setting in a game,  which focuses on the grittiness of the Moscow Metro and the surface of post-nuclear war Moscow.

Don't you love that feeling - waiting for years for the game to be released and then finally playing it. Too bad it only happens so rarely but these moments are ever so precious. Anyways.

The story takes place a year after the events of the first game. The Metro factions are mobilizing to fight and take over the D-6 bunker with all its military goodies. You are sent to kill the last remaining Dark One....

The narrative is still here except it's more defined and refined. The story is mostly presented the same way as in the first game except with some added flashbacks and twists. The airplane sequence for instance, gave me goosebumps and almost brought a tear to the eye. I didn't expect that.

The Dev. Team once again did an outstanding job with the atmosphere. The details to the machinery, the tools, the make-shift equipment, it's all there. The graphics are pretty much the same as in the first game with minor improvements. One thing I can say for certain is that this game features the best fire and water effects than in any other game. The dialogue between NPCs is sometimes pretty long and is always interesting to listen to. You get to meet new characters and cross paths with the old ones. They also added a substantial amount of various NPC models and only after looking real hard did I manage to find twins. The game retains its dystopian feel that's interwoven with some black humor jokes, cultural references (largely unchanged Nazi and Communist ideologies) as well as signs of the new emergent civilization - the theater sequence was particularly appealing. The game is also noticeably longer than the first one so you are getting your money's worth.

The negatives include but are not limited to: Not being able to see your legs, not being able to see your reflection in the mirror and not being able to speak a single word (even though this is Artyom's story too). The instant someone is killed their head flight dies with them for some unknown reason. But at least this time around we can actually cast a shadow AND the bodies of the slain enemies no longer disappear, for the most part.

The game has some gritty and genuinely creepy WTF moments. The old monsters are more vicious and the new monsters are quite disgusting, truly. I could do without those evil vine monsters, they just don't sit right with me. In addition, the human enemies die from one or two bullets which is more than I could say for most shooters. The human enemies take cover, roll over, throw grenades, call in back up, retreat and advance. They tease you and they lure you out.

For the most part, the game is as linear as the first one. There is also more exploration to do in some chapters than others. The game mechanics remain unchanged. The stealth system still works pretty well and there are a few close-kill animations added. Not only that, you now have the option of knocking people out instead of slicing their throat.

There are a few new weapons. You can still do some minor customizations to almost each one of them which is certainly welcome, only if, you hadn't spent the first quarter of the game without your primary starting weapon since you keep getting captured over and over again....""sigh""

The engine has been optimized pretty well. I was able to get 60 FPS on my GTX 680 while recording with Fraps and while playing in 3D. (I get half that running same hardware on the first game).

I've been playing on the Hardcore Ranger Mode and so far it's paying off. You can't just run around and slice monsters with your knife when you run out of bullets, two hits and you are dead, you can't see your bullet count and you can barely even discern whether you are using make-shift or the military-grade type of ammo. I do find it disturbing that they are charging $ 5 for the difficulty setting. Although, that point has nothing to do with the quality of the game. Make sure to add the line ""r_base_fov 80"" here %LOCALAPPDATA%4A GamesMetro LL to increase your field of view. It doesn't break the visual depiction of Artyom's arms too much. Make the cfg file read-only as well after you make the changes.

Overall, this a unique experience that was very much worth waiting for. The dread, the shudder, the melancholy, the distant clanking noises and the sound of Steven King's: ""The MIST arachnids"" will often send chills down your spine. The sheer feeling of sadness that this game radiates cannot be understated. What these Metro games do is allow you to experience a possible future (minus the mutants perhaps), so please support this developer. Make sure to listen to every dialogue and visit every last corner of this engineering marvel that stands as a potential savior of humanity, or in the least, as the protractor of its existence...",1385611008,1386044143,True,6,0,0.563146471977233887,0,True,False,False

Metro Last Light has a great story to tell, if you are willing to listen.  Filled with cut-scenes, and paired with a few dull moments, gameplay can become a little on the boring side.  But, Metro seems to keep you moving forward with the sound of monsters and enemies always at the heel of your feet.  Don't get me wrong, the story is for the most part, an exciting journey that has a great way of telling itself.  One of the main additions to the game, is the world that it is told in.  Even with Metro's longer story, you never visit the same area twice.  This is great, as it is an amazing world to look at, even if most of the world is a metro tunnel.  The game takes many twists and turns throughout the story, introducing and dropping characters many times during the chapters.  This can make it hard to gain that emotional connection that you get with other games.  Luckily, Metro's characters are always fun to listing to, and are filled with personality; keeping you entertained every step you take with them.  That is, whenever you are around them.  For the most part of the story, you find yourself walking alone in the darkness of the metro.  The game seemed to be forcing you to feel the sense of no hope, but instead feels like a lonely adventure game.  On the other hand, finally reuniting with old characters feels like a god-sent, until Artyom decides that the mission needs to be done alone.  Brilliant Artyom. 

Once Artyom has received his mission, you are then introduced to one of the main focuses of Last Light.  The atmosphere of a post apocalyptic world.  Metro Last Light is a game that sucks you into the character that you are playing, this also putting you into the world that Artyom is surrounded by.  The world is not darkened, rather the darkness surrounds you.  Only giving you a peek at the world if you happen to look over at it with your handy flashlight or lighter.  You hear the animals of the subway scurry around your feet as each step echoes down the large open space.   The walls are filled with cracks and rusty pipes that drip ever so often.  Electrical cables that crack and hiss from the neglect they have received, and mice that rush away from the light you carry.  Everything from your apocalypse dreams has come to life in the Metro.  If you still have not caught the hint, its that Metro Last Light is a gorges game to look at.  The developers have somehow made the game look like a triple A game, even under terrible working conditions.  They have made even the dirtiest tunnels look fantastic. 

Even with the simple dynamic Karma system that Metro offers, the game still lacks a linear storyline; forcing you to walk the same line that every metro explorer will take.  Metro is also full of little additions that make the game seem full.  Everything from burning down cobwebs, to unscrewing light bulbs to avoid the enemy.  Only problem, the AI will not notice you even with the lights on.  This was one main downfall of Metro Last Light.  The AI seems to always be set on easy, as you are able to give them a hug before killing them, and they still will not see you.  But, that is just a small complaint, since the mutated monsters of metro are scaring and hunting you just fine.  Maybe they scare a little too much. 
 
Over all, Metro Last Light is a wonder to play.  The game seems to throw horror, love, and an adventure game into a game, and Metro was born.   
+ Great looking graphics, even for a dirty metro 
+ Setting is spot on, really drawing you into the world of Artyom 
+ Story is great and fulfilling, even if it does feel a little lonely 
- AI is a little off, making larger battle scenes with them seem weak and unenjoyable. 
Metro is an amazing work of art, for any lover of horror or adventure games.  Earning it a final grade of-

The game has previous elements such as stealth and weaponry. A new feature is that you can upgrade your weapons as you please unlike in the previous game where you had to search for a specific attachement. One thing I can only point out as bad in the game is the recycled weapon sounds from Metro: 2033. Guns that have returned from Metro:2033 have the same sounds as before. There are a few new weapons in the game as well, plus you can carry up to three weapons instead of two. (if your not playing on ranger mode). Overall the game is shipped with a brand new story you'll love to experience!

Bottom Line: The game is a great continuation of the series and excells the storyline of Metro: 2033 one more year. Needs a little work by adding newer sounds though.

This game has always challenged me in its well designed stealth levels, and has maintained its balance between full-on FPS and an RPG style survival with plenty of side-stories. In fact, the Metro (the main underground system where the inhabitants have settled upon) is full of personal stories you can eavesdrop on- these little details make this apocalyptic world a real joy to play in.

Character developments are fantastically done in Last Light. As the story progresses, you feel more as though you are in the protagonist's shoes. Unlike other games where the gameplay takes priority over the story, Metro intigrates the story and the gameplay into one forged entity. It is a hard feat to accomplish, but Metro Last Light has done it flawlessly, and I applaud them for doing so.

The game utilises its environments well to keep you on the edge of your seat. I especially loved the levels where you are alone in the dark tunnels of the Metro, and all you can hear is the harsh, heavy breathing in your gas mask and the devilishly eerie sounds that echo around you. You are constantly looking behind your shoulders, alert and ready for anything that will strike you from the darkness. But the real fear is of the unknown, and it is really emphasized in this game.

The graphics are yet again one of the most punishing and beautiful out there, but its lower settings have been optimized for lower-end PCs, so for all you budget gamers out there- don't panic if you have a shoddy GPU, because i've played through the whole game without any trouble on my integrated Intel HD 4000.

To sum up, I can say for sure that no game  has ever made me play for so long without the desire to sleep. I've spent hours playing this game all the way past midnight, even though on most horror games I tend to steer clear of playing at night. This game is the perfect equilibrium between storytelling excellence and survival-FPS action. High replayability in Ranger Mode, great depths of exploration and amazing game mechanics makes this my favourite game of all time.

But the story go's with you launching the missiles on the dark ones. Now some might not be to happy with that since it did not follow on from there choices. But I believe this to be a good thing for the story/plot of this game.

Now its a year after the incident and Artyom (you). Are now with a group called the order. You have been given a mission to capture/kill what appears to be the last of the Dark ones. You head out with a woman called Anna who is Colonel Miller's sarcastic daughter and the Rangers' best sniper.

Artyom (you) soon succeeds in finding the Dark One, who turns out to be a mere child, but soon after that two of them are captured by Nazi Reich. A Communist Red Line soldier called Pavel. Helps you escape the Reich, and soon you and Pavel befriend each other after spending considerable time fighting across the Metro tunnels and the wasted surface together. However when the two of you reach a Red Line settlement. It turns out you are betrayed by Pavel who is revealed to be a high-ranking officer of the Red Line. In your attempts of escaping captivity. Artyom learns of a plan by the Red Line's head of military intelligence, General Korbut, to capture D6 and take control of the entire Metro. Korbut is assisted by Pavel as well as Lesnitsky, a traitorous Ranger who escaped to the Red Line with samples of a bioweapon stolen from D6. Here is where you start your hunt over the Metro. I certainly enjoyed it. So I will leave it there so you can find out the rest on your own.

Game Play: What can I say. The setting is in the darkness of the metro and on the wasted surface to. Sneaking through the dark to bypass enemies or outright killing them like a looney on speed. Those who know me I always prefer the second. Now there is some points which was rather frustrating where you can not use your night vision goggles or your torch. So you have to use thats right one of two things. Your bullet lighter and use the direction of the wind or the night vision scope.... Which somehow works? When your goggles do not. Don't ask me that had me going ok...??

But with that it leads me to the weapons There is many weapons to choose from. You are allowed to carry three at a time. They have upgrades for them. Even though they are genuinely the same. For each gun, maybe leaving a few out. That did not bother me since I felt that suited the game. Ok the AI. I read on another review just to see what some others have said and I have to admit the mutants kinda do just run at you in a straight line. Humans seem to have a better AI. Although its still easily overcomeable if you're an evil bear like me. But that did not stop my enjoyment of the game.

Up top. Some good area's worked into this game. Giving you the feel of an open world but sadly not a true open world game. But do not let it discourage you. It is still a fun game to play with its moments of EEK hide. There is a hidden moral system but! I am not going to tell you about it as I feel this is a good part of the game. Not like in Mass Effect where its in your face. Even though I still like that game to. But enough of that.

Controls: Usual keyboard and mouse features easy to use and all there is the controller option there. But who in their right mind would want to use a controller for this game.

The Graphics: Now from what I have seen on my play through the graphics look sweet and crisp. Just like the smooth skin of a babies bottom. The mutants look scary just as they should the environment looks good. This does it nicely for game even though you are in darkness a lot.

Music: What can I say. I loved listening to it in the first game and I love listening to it in this game. It just has that feel to me that it suits the game nicely.

Bugs and Glitches: Now I did read that some folk were having issues with the graphic's and fsp. Now I never come across this issue since I never max everything out. So I can only go by what people say. So looks like another game that seems to be directed toward nvidia has problems again with AMD/ATI cards. Always expectable. But since I never really had any issues i can't let it interrupt my count.

Replay Value: Well I have to say there is a replay value in this game for sure. With the hidden moral system. I am intrigued if I can get the other ended to the game. Which I left out of the review till now on purpose!

Overall: Story is good certainly kept me entertained, Gameplay just as enjoyable from the first. Controls easy to use. Graphics another good one in my books. Music perfect for the game. Glitches am not going to say there is none. But for me I never came across any. Replay values is certainly there and I will be replaying this one for sure.

The reality the game creates is very genuine, most of the times I'm indulged in the game because of all the tiny details and interactions is really good, and mood completely captures you while you are in the wild. Having said that, there're some things to complain about: first of all, the total gametime is about 10 hours or so, which is a little bit too short. Music becomes dull after a while for its repeatitiveness. Weaponry is not rich enough although you can make some modifications, and the firing sound effects aren't convincing. The main story falls a little bit into cliche for it didn't make me feel excited, but still its essential seems to be the dark, desperate mood which I did feel along through the game. The gameplay is what probably I want to complain the most because the sets are mostly just endless tunnels and small rooms, and confusing sometimes too because I've been stuck several times for being unable to find the path.

The combat is in a classical FPS style with a small twist with weapon customization, it also included some quite unique weapons, although the most are your generic SMGs and snipers.

However beyond that this game is underrated and is possibly one of the best games released in years, it rivals the most atmospheric games in game history.

The Good:

Amazing weapons
- Great impact, sound, recoil etc. they really feel real when you use them.
- They look great and have a great amount of attachments that can greatly shift the way they function

Great enemies and sections that can get really tense
- The game always give you a fair chance to fight and if you die it's always you that fuck up. In other words it's never a cheap fight.
- The stealth is greatly improved since Metro 2033 and is a legit way to be played.
- The enemies are dangerous and frightening causing you to tip toe, but just like the Stalker series if you keep calm and think you can overcome anything.

More goodies:
Good moral choices
Decent story
The cites in the metro feels alive and mysterious
Hidden areas and cool features in the cites
Ranger mode adds massive challenge

The Bad:

Minor parts of the story feels forced
Grenades, Knifes and Claymores are handled in a stupid way
Ranger mode hides everything making quick time events invisible and handling grenades/knives/etc is a pain in the ass
Some sections are very restricted and narrow

The DLC is mostly too short though except for the Developer pack with the spider lair and museum. Compared to the horde mode in the tower pack to the developer pack, the latter is superior. The Spider lair was the most intense mission I ever played in the game and a welcome addition.

It also managed to absolutely terrify me from time to time. 

If atmospheric shooters with a big focus on story are your thing, there's no real question here. Just get and play this game. 

Something to note for returning players from 2033: this game revamps and fixes the awful stealth from the previous game and turns it into something enjoyable and thrilling. I can't overemphasize how much I loved this game.

Protip: Nvidia Physx is automatically on and makes the game run pretty choppy if you don't have a Physx-enabled card. The Physx settings are hidden under ""gameplay"" options instead of ""graphics"", so it's easy to miss.

3. The best way to play this is on Normal Mode, Hard Difficulty. Also, make sure you set your gamma as recommended, since it adds even more depth to the atmosphere.

Now, on to my recommendation.

Metro: LL is easily the one of the most engrossing single-player games I have ever played since Half-Life 2. If you're the kind of person who can immerse himself in a game world and can make time for the small details, you will absolutely love this game's outstanding visual and sound design.

As expected, Metro Last Light is - in essence - Metro 2033, except moreso. Those poor sods who couldn't appreciate the first game won't like this one either; the levels are still linear and often fairly short, and the game is prone to interrupt your free roaming so you can watch scripted, in-engine cutscenes (some levels are essentially nothing more than extended cutscenes). But  if you loved the original, then you won't find fault with the sequel either. It's basically the first game with a lot of the roughed corners filed down.

Where it shines, of course, is in the gloomy, apocalyptic atmosphere it presents. It's very Russian. Even more so than the first, I can totally buy into the fantastic underground civilization, despite some lackluster animations and occassionally poor voice-acting. Increased variety in setting greatly helps sell the presentation; from the spider-haunted abandoned tunnels, to the surface swamplands or to the subterranean ""Venice"". 

The game presents a nice balance of making you feel like a gun-toting unstoppable bad-ass while at the same time feeling vulnerable and small. The aforementioned swamps were particularly well done; monsters on every side, rustling unseen in the brush or swimming beneath the murky waters, as the sun slowly dipped beneath the horizon. Individually, I knew I could take any one of the mutants, but should they rush me I knew I'd be overwhelmed. It was wonderfully tense.

Another example was a random side-encounter in one of the tunnels; as you enter your flashlight half-illuminates vaguely man-shaped shadows; but when you move the light away, there's nothing there. The longer you stayed in the tunnel, the more solid the shadows became, accompanied by an increasingly foreboding soundtrack. Even though consciously I recognized there was no actual threat, I still dashed my avatar out of that room as if the devil himself were after me. Awesome.

The actual gameplay has been improved. There are typically two ways to get through a level; guns a'blazing or via stealth. The gunplay offers a satisfactory adrenalin kick; the AI isn't particularly smart (although they're better than in most FPS games) but their weapons pack quite a kick. They usually also have numbers on their side. My own weapons seem more accurate and slightly more powerful this time (and the silencers are actually silent this time; it may not be realistic but it's more fun). The stealth has been dramatically improved, with the addition of quiet, non-lethal take-downs and an on-screen indicator letting you know when you can (or can't) be seen. It's much easier to ninja through a level now. 

But Metro really isn't a game about confrontation; despite it's linear levels, it's focused more on exploration. The game encourages you to explore the nooks and crannies of this sunken civilation, and rarely are these escapades without reward. It may be ammo, or an amusing overheard conversation, or a gruesome (but interesting) tableau, butthere's always something to find. 

So yeah, Metro Last Light really fits my fancy. Dark and unforgiving, but with the hopeful glint of magic drawing me ever further into the fathomless depths.

It does a great deal to streamline some of the less intuitive aspects of the original, though whether or not that is a good thing is a matter of opinion. It maintains the original's dreary atmosphere and omnipresent feeling of danger. The game devotes more time to telling its story than the original did, which I feel is actually to its detriment. The original Metro's story was intentionally sparse and mystifying, designed to leave the player just as clueless as the person they were playing as, while Last Light seems to be more concerned with setting up a hollywood action movie style of story. It also feels as though the game rewards diligent exploration far less than the original did. 

Pros:
* Graphics. While my aging laptop is (sadly) too weak to play the game at full graphical settings I've watched others play it on PCs that can handle it and goodness me this game is stunning if you've a computer that can bear the burden. Even on the lower settings it still looks great, if not quite as stunning.
* Combat has been improved since the first and feels far more natural.

Cons
* Stealth in this game is, unlike the first game, piss easy. Enemies are incredibly easy to sneak past provided it's even slightly dark.
* Forcing players to shell out an extra $5 for ranger mode is in poor taste as it was included for free in the original. Ranger mode itself also seems to have been designed as an afterthought, with its use crippling a few incredibly basic necessities in the GUI like knowing which kind of grenade you just equipped.

Overall it's still a very good game, just not quite as good as the original. If you can get it on sale for $30 or less I would absolutely say you're getting your money's worth.",1378916534,1385415152,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

The graphics, art design, level design, sound design and all that really come together again to form an atmosphere that is amazing. Some of the outdoor moments are breathtakingly beautiful and the level of immersion is some of the best out there (blood and sweat getting on your gas mask, wiping it away, seeing your breath when the mask is off, etc...). Also, the best fog effects I have seen in any game so far. Performance for M:LL was much better than 2033.

The game starts off after Metro: 2033 so if you have not beaten the game yet then you should go and do that first.  The atmosphere is extremely good. You get the sense that the world was nuked and with the struggle to survive. The gameplay improves upon the last game in every single way except ammo. What about ammo? It is everywhere that is what. In the first Metro, ammo was scarce, but at the same time there were less enemies that needed killing per level. 

Metro: Last Light does a good job in giving you parts of Moscow and the Metro and does not leave you bored even when there is a level with zero enemies.

The graphics are much improved over Metro: 2033 and it runs better as well. With my 7850 1GB OC to 1200Mhz Core and 1300Mhz Memory with an i5 the game runs very high with  V-sync, no tesselation in 1050p at a constant 60fps. In 1080p you will get to 50fps so if you can handle it then go ahead and play in 1080p

One of the previous games strongest points - its atmosphere - has not been lost. The cramped and dimly lit environments keep the metro underground feeling real and creates a massive contrast for the times you are allowed on the surface, which you actually spend a lot more time upon here. It gives a much better insight as to just how uninhabitable the world is (for humans) rather than just being shown a glimpse to prove the point of ""yeah, its really fucked up there"".

The weapons retain their variety and even manage to be expanded through being able to be customised. Though not a grand selection, being able to outfit a trusted weapon for greater use is always a plus. Perhaps on the downside, being able to silence any weapon for little penalty almost makes the game a little too easy. Perhap an undesirable feature of ranger hardcore mode is that you have no way of knowing how much of any ammo you have: picking up a new weapon may leave you with only the bullets remaining in its magazine, only to find that out in the middle of an encounter much to your dismay. 

The story continues where the last left off and keeps on with its disambiguity towards just about everything. The world is taken as a whole; its inhabitants being individual. Survival is utmost and a key factor in near enough all motives: choosing to engage certain enemies may reveal something about them, such as a ""demon"" that attacks but upon killing it you discover it was only trying to protect its child.

Assuming your computer is up to the task, this game offers the most immersive  atmosphere that you can ever ask for in a shooter.  I played through on hardcore ranger mode my first time through.   This was only possible because I've played through 2033 a few times.  Not that I recommend getting this game without having played the first one, but if you want to feel like you are a survivor in the underground, post apocalyptic metro, play ranger mode.  You may have a few questions that you'll have to look up to understand some of the game play, but O.M.G is it worth it.

The guns sound and feel so real in your hands.  The ambient sounds that fill your surround sound headphones, if you have a set, are intense to say the least.  Cut off the music, cut off the subtitles and dive into a grungy world of survival.

I need not tell you how well done the lighting is, not to mention how well optimized this game is compared to its predecessor.  You will lose yourself in the depth of the darkness if you allow it.  The balance to the game play was a thing of beauty.  Towards the end of the game I was starting to get low on ""money"" and ammo, picking my shots, and choosing when to run instead of fight.  A true master piece! 10 out of 10!...... And I don't say that often...

The story Is very different from Metro 2033, and I found myself questioning the premise of the game a lot. A large number of people have the perception of Metro being an open-world game.

One major flaw I noticed while playing was their stealth system. You are basically invisible to enemies if you are in pitch black, nowhere near a light source. Though if you stand in front of an enemy long enough, they will notice you no matter how dark it is.

One slightly less major flaw was the new physics settings. In Metro 2033 physics were set so low that it felt like you were on the moon. Metro Last Light does the exact opposite and is noticable in rag dolls and the newly added bouncing breasts and butts. Rag dolls seem to enter warp speed when killed with ballistics and breasts do 360 degree rotations when doing the Can Can.

Other features that 2K added, such as wiping your gas mask off, really add to the immersion, making you feel like you are vulnerable rather than having an always clean gas mask. And of course the features from Metro 2033, such as having to power your flash light and NVGs periodically, add to that effect.

Filters have to be changed frequently, which maintains a level of urgency and the glass becomes obscured by rain and blood until you can wipe it off. It's hard to put in the words but for me it's one of the greatest strengths of the game and worth experiencing.

The levels are well crafted, there is a good illusion of freedom and you are given a reasonably broad range of strategic options for the various situations. The safe-zone village environments, where much of the story unfolds, are full of life and detail, but they sometimes lack a little interactivity. However this didn't negatively affect immersion for me.  Choices made by the player throughout do feel  influential, but without being too unreasonable or feeling too binary.

On hardcore difficulty the game is a decent challenge  and the pace is solid. Gunplay is satisfying and kinetic and the enemies challenging. Fights feel suitable tactical against human enemies, and suitable frantic against more monstrous opponents.   Stealth sections are also well implemented.

All in all it seems like an improvement over the first game in almost all aspects, perhaps only let down by slightly superior writing and story in the original.
Last light is a fantastically immersive and atmospheric  story-driven FPS. The environment is rich, the story enjoyable and the graphics and game design finely crafted.

The atmosphere of the game is fantastic, it feels very believable and really adds to the tension that mutants can be just around the corner, waiting to pounce. The game is also looks fantastic when you turn up the graphics settings to max. 
I also liked the back story of the ongoing war in the Metro between the Rangers, the Reds (Communists) and the Reich (Nazis).
Playing on the hardest difficulty is the best way to play this game (Ranger Hardcore. I know, difficulty as DLC is pretty unacceptable), because it's challenges you to preserve your ammo as best you can, plus enemies are more deadly and no heads-up display to tell you how much ammo you have left.

This series hailing from Russia is one of the finest FPSes to appear in the last ten years. It's a sheer tour-de-force.

Mankind has fallen. Its survivors huddle together in the ruined metro tunnels beneath Moscow. Mutants and twisted remnants of the old world remain to hunt what little is left. You are Artyom, one of the Polis rangers charged with keeping peace in the Metro.

How will you do this? By sneaking, shooting, exploring, and doing whatever you can.

At its heart Metro Last Light is a shooter with slick combat and stealth mechanics greatly improved from its predecessor, Metro 2033. While you are a silent protagonist who is at various times guided along by an AI companion, Call of Duty this is not. While there are a number of scripted events, they compliment stellar gameplay where you decide how to approach levels and whether you wish to shoot your way out or be a shadow. Instead of Call of Duty, its closest kin is Half-Life with a dash of well realized stealth mechanics. While not having anywhere near Valve's level of polish, Metro: Last Light amazes with beautiful graphics and a heady blend of gameplay inspired by countless shooters and first person adventures while sustaining its own unique voice.

Of particular note is the game's invisible morality system; while it is never completely explained, your actions will affect whether or not you attain a bad ending or a good ending. Unlike some games, it can be a challenge to obtain. It's not just a matter of staying your hand from stealth executions; often times you acquire morality points toward a good ending by just listening to other people tell their tales about living in the Metro. It's frustrating that you'll never know if you came close to obtaining the bad ending or not, but at least unlike other games, Metro Last Light makes sure that even the bad ending is worth the price of admission.

Metro's world sucks you in; it's hell down below, and worse up above in the blasted wasteland. Even at its bleakest, Metro is a fantastic invitation to explore a wasteland that isn't peppered with the retro sci-fi sensibilities of Fallout and instead with its own bleak stamp of the future. It's a full blown apocalypse, Russian style, and the impressive details 4A Games have put into Last Light can be found in every nook and cranny.

The graphics are fantastic, they're near Crysis 3 levels; a little rough around the edges, but overall good when combined with the art style.
Gunplay is very similar to Metro 2033, but a bit more streamlined; you can always stealth if you want to, or go in guns blazing (Or mix and match).

Please read my recommendation on Metro 2033. This game is definitely in the same water, but a bigger, nicer, upgraded boat ;)

Last Light was very atmospheric, military rounds were in surplus in this game in comparison to the first. This was handy for when you were getting your ass kicked or you needed to take down a boss mutant. I feel the achievements were a pain in the ass, but most chapters (there were 31 in total) were not more than 15 minutes, so it's quite possible to replay the chapters to get some of them.

The game has a great stealth element, improved from the first. You can knock out or kill enemies from behind and with suppressed weaponry it's fairly easy to clear areas without raising alarm. Even if you do alert someone you can normally back track, hide, and reengage, Metal Gear Solid style :)

I didn't feel as much tension or anxiety in this game as the first. I think it's because I knew most of the enemies, what to expect, and I was well prepared to go all out on the mutants (military rounds, grenades, etc).

Pluses - More gun options, more military rounds, solid gameplay and story. Return of original game's characters was pretty freakin cool- Khan's a real BA. The heroic ending was disappointing when I found out about Anna. The redemption ending was better, imo. This makes earning the ""moral points"" in both games give the better ending, but at least the 2nd wasn't as crappy because of the heroism involved.

Cons - Not as scary, not as mysterious... Kinda like playing ME2 after ME1 and you knew what the reapers were. Like watching Aliens after Alien and knowning what the Alien looked like and how it behaved. The first game's suspense and the mystery of what was to come seriously added value you won't get in the 2nd game. There was no armor or permanent upgrades to buy with military rounds. I literally went into town, sold all the ammo for the guns I didn't use, and about 25% of the ammo I did use, if I was maxed out, and ended up with over 1300-1400 military rounds at one point.

It's not bad, but some things could be shaped up.

Characters/Story/Dialog: 7/10 - Not bad, but the book had philosophical issues. The game doesn't. Then again, that's sort of to be expected.

Atmosphere: 10/10 - It's Metro. The first game got awards for atmosphere. AWARDS.

Mechanics: 7/10 - To me, the weapons had kind of a laggy feel to them, and I would think there would be more pneumatic based weapons not requiring the $25 for DLC.

Scary Parts: Occasionally is creepy, but some of the horror is taken out because it is incredibly scripted, and/or the game tries to hard to make use of ghosts.

Russian-ness: 8/10 - Needs vodka as useable item.

What I want in a sequel: Open-world metro, created much like the spirit of STALKER with various factions, and jobs you can do for them.   Everything's there, JUST IMPLEMENT IT.
Co-op would also be nice, but 2 players only and a slightly altered story to account for both.

But if you turn off PhysX and generally lower things, it'll look good and get perfectly decent FPS. You're able to customize your weapons this time around, though generally speaking it's very noticable it's been made with consoles in mind. One really nice feature is the fact that stealth has lost the incredible derpiness it had in the first game, i.e. sneaking up on someone in a secluded area and going at him with your knife from behind won't alert everyone within a hundred miles.

If you're reading this in 2014, maybe they've acually released the Chronicles pack, which was supposed to have been released several months ago now. Initially they said that all 4 DLCs would be released within 60 days starting sometime in the summer, but that obviously didn't happen. It was more like 1 DLC every 60th day.

Speaking of DLCs, seriously, don't bother with the Tower and Developer packs, they're pretty much random scrap thrown together as some sort of an afterthought. Both of them aren't even worth £3 in my view. The Faction pack though is A-OK. The Reich mission was utter shite, the Red Line sniper was OK, and the Polis Kshatriya was awesome, legendary, orgasmic!

Also, buy the Ranger DLC. Yeah, should've been included really, but it's not, and considering the price/quality ratio, it's definitely worth it. Only thing I don't like is the outright retarded logic of ""no HUD what-so-ever in Ranger Hardcore"". Sorry, but until we get some Occulus Rift virtual reality shit where we can actually look down on our virtual selves in the game and pick magazines, grenades, and other pieces of equipment out of our pouches and rucksack and thus get a sense of exactly what we're carrying, you're just gonna have to go ahead and give us a HUD. The notion of limiting both ammo and something as incredibly vital as gasmask filters and then not giving you any hint about how much you have of it and playing the ""it's reality, herp"" card won't work. In reality, you could easily count how many filters, magazines, etc. you're carrying. In a game, you can't.

One thing they desperatly need to improve upon (still), is monsters clipping through you. More than 75% of the times when I've been killed in monster attacks, it's been because they clipped right through and into me, meaning I couldn't shoot them nor see them.

The graphics are excellent, with it's dark atmosphere being the main draw. There is a stealth element, but it's unclear as to when you will be hidden by the games' many shadows. You still must maintain things like battery charge and gasmask filters, with a decent balance of underground tunnel and aboveground wasteland. However the experience only teases someone who is looking for something more free flowing like Fallout.

Took 12 hours form me on normal, and I did a lot of scrounging, although I probably didn't need to to be honest.  Just a well done, story driven corridor shooter.

Long story short, the stealth is so oversimplified it becomes dull very quickly, the story isn't as well-put together as was in 2033, and overall the game just lacked focus, for lack of a better word.

But it's not terrible, either, so I'd call it a 6 out of 10. Comparatively, 2033 was an 8 or 9, and I'm no IGN 9.5/10 ""it's okay""-type rater.  Give it a try if you want a very, VERY pretty apocalypse simulator in war-torn Russia. Bring your shotgun.

- If you're claustrophobic, avoid it. There's many open areas but even more tight and dark tunnels.

A lot of the things that kept Metro 2033 from being great rather than just good were really polished well in this game, though the AI can be pretty bad at times and there are some balance issues, but overall the gameplay is very fun. It really shows that corridor shooters are still completely doable in modern gaming. The tunnels of the metro make rapture feel spacious. Everything about this game is clausterphobic and really adds to the tension of the gameplay. This is broken up by surface missions which aren't necessarily as clausterphobic but in no way safer feeling either. Lastly, the story is really complex and it is probably worth playing again (or playing metro 2033 first) to understand all the political schemeing but the meta narrative, Artyom's story is really compelling and interesting with some of the best scripted sequences in the genre.

If you've played the first one then you have more of an understanding of the ""dark ones"" that Last Light focuses on, but playing through the first isn't really necessary as the ""dark ones"" only really emerge towards the end of the game (apart from the stories you here from various people).

Conversely, if you allow Metro: Last Light to dictate your pace, and you go with the flow, you will be rewarded with a lasting experience.

Most importantly, this game is incredibly story-driven—a fantastic outlet for players wanting a thought-provoking first-person shooter. Admittedly, I did not always understand what my purpose was for being in certain locations, nor could I consistently distinguish how important NPCs were fitting into the story. Fortunately, these slight mysteries provoked me into pressing onward in the hopes of unraveling answers. By the arrival of the end credits, most (not all) of my questions were answered, and I was satisfied with the ending.

You play as the silent hero Artyom, meaning your character does not speak; this is similar to Gordon Freeman of Half-Life and Corvo Attana of Dishonored. This allows you, the player, to step into his boots and assume his identity. The only exceptions to this rule of silence, however, come from grunts of pain during the action and his signature recital of diary entries during map loading.

-The FPS action is a lot of fun for the most part.
-Graphics are excellent and ran very well on my GTX580.
-There is a pretty good Stealth Component to the game should you choose to use it.

I had a lot of fun playing this game, the story is decent and has a nice twist to it but the gameplay is linear, which isn't a problem for me but might be for some.  

The only flaw I had with this game was the stupid Mutant type encounters.  I just don't enjoy them at all.  There were a couple boss fights with stupid mutant monsters that was well done, but still lame too me.  The mutants detract from the overall game IMO.  I would love to see a future entry in the series get rid of the mutants and focus solely on human NPC battles, with a strong optional stealth component in it.",1373150404,1373150404,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While graphics aren't everything, they really can add something when done right, and here, they were done right. All the basic game mechanics are in place the real bummer is that as of me writing this it requires insanely powerful hardware to really get the full experience. Even my i7 2600k gtx580 rig choked on this game to the point of slideshow when I tried maxing it completely. This may actually be something to look at in a year or two after you get that next hardware upgrade. It's pushing things even for the best hardware on the market right now though. 

All that said it does have dx9 mode allowing you to play the game with older hardware, but it really is just a completely different experience that way, and I honestly wouldn't reccomend it. This game is a complete package, but it's demands on hardware leave it limited to only those of us really top shelf hardware from the last couple of years to even get an idea of the complete experience. 

So yeah that kind of sums it up. It's a good game but it's a monster on even good hardware at the moment. It's a next gen game engine and maybe it's just a little ahead of it's time.

Overall, a good game. Good storyline, good graphics, good action.
Drawbacks: invisible walls everywhere make it very linear; just a single path to walk.
Action is being interrupted by too much video scenes and in-between maps but, when action comes up, everything is fine.

Das positive kommt zuerst: Das Spiel hat wieder die gleich geile Atmosphäre wie der Vorgänger. Durch die vielen Menschenmassen, das zusammenleben der Bewohner und den Charaktern und Details bekommt Metro last light eine super Atmosphäre. Die Charaktere sind gut gemacht und blicken nicht mehr so leblos in die Luft wie bei Teil 1. Die Gestaltung und Umgebung der Missionen sind häufig unterschidlich. Einmal kämpft ihr in den Katakomben, dann an der Verstrahlten Oberfläche,..... Außerdem ist auch die Story recht spanndend und dauert ca. 8-10 Stunden, je nachdem auf welchen Schwierigkeitsgrad man spielt. Die Grafik, Steuerung, Details and dem Spiel alles ist top.  Nun zu den Negativen Sachen an Metro last light : Wenn man das Spiel vorbestellt hat, hat man den Ranger modus ( ein extra harter Schwierigkeitsmodus ) dazubekommen, sonst muss man ihn für 5 $ nachkaufen. Die Entwickler sagen man sollte das Spiel auf dem Schwierigkeitsgrad zocken weil das am besten powert. aber wie soll des gehen wenn man ihn sepparat kaufen muss. Dann gibt es noch ein multiplayer der aber als sepparates Spiel erscheinen soll. Munition muss man eigentlich nur selten kaufen weil man eigentlich immer welche findet und die Stimmen einiger Charakteren sind nicht immer so Hammer.

Сюжет действительно книжный,несет много мыслей и смысла о жизни и смерти, прощении и мести, выживании и жизни у всех своей по своему нелегкой, но с лучами надежды несущей нас на всем протяжении игры.

Так же в игре из реплик можно услышать как отцы воспитывают своих сыновей, делают из них суровых бойцов заставляя смотреть на казни и пытки и ощутить жизнь такой какая она есть. В игре показана борьба,борьба во всем в человеке и между людьми,людей и мира    и наоборот. Чисто по механике игра красивая, и радует глаз.

I was afraid they would over-do the cinematics, deviate from their roots, and try to please a more general audience. And eventhough they tweaked combat to be more fast-paced, I fully enjoyed the game, start to finish.
It was more of the same claustrophobic tunnels, mixed up with outdoors scenes. Yet it was very different and refreshing at the same time. The out-door areas feel much more vast and alive. The tunnels are beautifully decorated and masterfully lit, and the new towns will make your yaw drop (Underground Venice, anyone?).

The story follows up on the events that passed in the previous game, so playing Metro 2033 first is a big recommendation if you want the full experience.
Where the previous game focused mainly on the mutant threat, Last Light shows the inner struggle of mankind.

On my first play-through on Ranger Hardcore difficulty, I clocked in on around 12 hours. In that time, you go to many different locations, follow a twisting story-line, and generally shoot a lot of bad guys and mutants. While I think they could have gone deeper in certain events that occur during the story-line, I also believe it worked out great in the end.

I mostly enjoy roaming the tunnels in the dark shadows, observing all of the beautiful light. But equally impressive is the attention to realism in everything that happens. Guards will hang around and seem genuinely bored, but as soon as you request an airlock be opened, they will be on their guard, grab their weapon and be ready for what could be out there. 
This attention to detail is all over the entire game, and it makes for a very believable and enjoyable gaming experience.

The game is very story-driven and quite linear, which might turn some people down. But if you want a great post-apocalyptic experience in a fantastic underground world, then you have no excuse not to buy this game.

You're not really meant to go in guns blazing, but you can. Though, you'll find yourself constantly low on ammo playing that way. In most of the player's engagements with human characters you're better off sticking to the shadows and performing stealth kills. That's not a downside, though. The stealth  is crafted fairly well in this game. It will have you unscrewing lightbulbs and blowing out lanterns trying to create as much darkness as possible. The pacing of the game is nearly flawless. Whenever you've snuck your way though a human occupied area you can almost rest assure a mutant infested area is on its way. Fighting mutants is generally when the action ramps up, which you'll look forward too since the gunplay is tight. Pull out your shotty and blast away. If you're a fan of ""atmosphere"" in a game, this is one you'll want to check out. The world that was crafted here really sucks you in. There's a point in the game where you pass through a town that has a full 10 minute or so stage show with different acts allowing you to pass right by or take a theater seat and watch the whole thing. The game isn't without flaws, though. There are a few minor things, most notably the ai can be rather stupid once in a while.

Damn, annoyingly difficult at points, near impossible if you don't spring for ammo and search every nook n cranny and use some pretty smart tactics.
Stealth-wise the AI needs to be improved. The AI runs on three settings most of the time, you'll know what I mean once you play.
Story-wise...it is tripping balls. Some pretty good moments here and there, but the story loses itself at times and near the end takes a drive off the deep-end. The ending itself is...odd, but given the books it will work out.
Graphics are awesome overall, and the sound combined with that fact allows for some great immersion when AI or bugs doesn't snap you back to reality. Playing this game fully maxed out in a dark room really captures everything perfectly.

Everything that made Metro 2033 great is in Last Light and more. The environment is still incredibly immersive and well pull together, even tossing you in to familiar locations. Cover mechanics are great being that some cover is destructable so you're not entirely safe even when you think you may be. Shadows give some safety but the AI is smart enough to search shadowy areas for threats after a bit of time. Plenty of times when I again found myself holding my breath in this game.

Some improvements were made to the hud making your watch more useful than in 2033. Personally I like that you don't auto-change air filters in Last Light, sort of makes you pay attention. I got nearly stuck after running out of filters a couple of times when I just died over an over until I by chance came upon a filter that just squeaked me through an area. Really gives the feeling of ""I've got to make the right decisions or I won't be getting any further"". 

Character designs are excellent. Everyone has a personality and you'll get a feeling of who's who. Some folks are just trying to live thier lives, some are trying to make a difference in some way or another. There are a few more adult situations you'll work through, which gave the game an altogether more realistic feeling.

Pick this up, but definately play Metro 2033 first. Both games are great, but Last Light will make more sense if you start from playing 2033.

What a game! A true spectacle and a much needed break from the typical military FPS. For such a low budget game, it plays like a true triple A experience. Experiencing a dyeing world, tunnel after tunnel, monstrosity after monstrosity, Metro: Last Light proves that an FPS doesn't need to be all about guns blazing to be entertaining. 

So much love and obvious attention to detail went into making the player feel like he is part of this world. Aside from some technical issues (low frames, but much better than the previous Metro), Last Light has just the right amount of everything needed for an adventure. Strong FPS mechanics, convincing environments riddled with despair and death, and sound effects that will give you the fucking chills. What's even more awesome is the concept of low ammunition. Granted you can buy ammo every now and than, when you start running low, you feel the tension rising. This game does not throw ammo at you like Resident Evil 4, 5, and 6. Players must make the right choices and run from combat at times, keeping an eye on their filters, gas mask damage, screen stains, and more. 

When you come into contact with small cities, you feel over joyed that people are surviving in this horrible post apocalypse underground Metro world. When you rise from the undergrounds, into broad day, you feel the death in the air as your screen is filled with flash backs of what once was as you progress. Never a dull moment, and always making you feel some type of way, Metro: Last Light took a masterful book and created an experience I will remember for years.

>>Game is highly optimized, running on a stock GTX 560 Ti, I was able to have 50-60 FPS constantly.
>>Stealth is very much improved.  You can sneak through the entire game without killing anyone (you can knock them out at melee range instead of killing).
>>Cities feel more alive, with things to do in them beyond just buy bullets and weapons.
>>Weapon customization.  Want to use a bastard with a scope on it?  Okay.  Want to put a stock on it to reduce recoil?  Got it.
>>The game is a lot more immersive, with being able to use your lighter to clear away spider webs, you have to wipe blood and dirt off your gas mask, and manually change your gas mask filter.
>>DLC to come, rumored to be co-op and VS multiplayer.
>>The number of mutant creatures is greatly increased.  Critters like mutant birds and worms, to fucking bears, giant spiders, and amphibious fish.
>>Titties.
>>Lapdance (no, seriously)

Cons:
>>The ending is very abrupt.  It just sort of.. ends, with hardly any buildup
>>While less linear than 2033, it's still very linear.  Your choices only change the ending, not anything else
>>The game is only optimized on NVIDIA cards.  The game runs TERRIBLY on AMD cards currently.  I've heard rumors of fixes, but it may take some time
>>Despite being very optimized, my framerate sometimes plummets to ~10-15 in certain areas, with no warning.  
>>Stealth is a bit easy at times.  Human enemies can be 100% oblivious to you despite you being two feet in front of them.  So long as you're in the dark, you're completely invisible to them.
>>While feeling more alive, cities still feel very ""empty,"" with little to no interaction with the inhabitants.  
>>Checkpoint system can still fuck you in the ass, like it did in 2033
>>The sound is a bit messed up.  If you're more than a few feet away from characters at certain scenes, they sound like they're in the other room.  The same goes from where you're looking at relative to their position.  It may just be me, but it throws me off every time.  This seems to only really happen early in the game, but it still happens throughout the game.
>>You have to pay $5 for Ranger difficulty, kind of stupid
>>Game feels very easy compared to the first.  I think I had something like 950 military bullets by the end?  Ammunition in the Metro is a lot more common, to combat this, you have ammunition limits (like 330 rounds for 5.45) to keep your ammunition relatively low.  This was playing on ""Normal"" difficulty, mind you.

Despite all the cons, the game is still fucking amazing.  I'm on my second playthrough as a pacifist (no human kills) and I still love it.  I'm still finding stuff taht they littered about the environments, too.  I would really recommend this game to anyone who liked the first game, because it improves on it in so, so many ways.",1368851567,1368851567,True,1,1,0.510918974876403809,0,True,False,False

I would have to say that I really enjoyed this game.  Most of all I would say that it was the areas, atmosphere, and the alone feeling from time to time (even with NPC's.)  Overall  the areas felt very dead and very alive.  

A bonus - this game did not have many quick time events.  Around 10 or so, that all required the same button.  The guns were fun, I liked stabbing things, and looting ammo/reading/listening to diaries.  The voice acting was fun to listen to.

Just like Metro 2033 - Not enough areas to explore, not a lot of freedom, and lots of hallways.  The other side of the coin.. if you love running around shooting things, you'll be disappointed they make you explore and listen to people.

1. It ended.

The gunplay is massively improved over Metro 2033, as are the stealth mechanics. The guns as a whole are superb - even The Bastard and Duplet become veritable powerhouses with the multitude of attachments in the game. My only complaint regarding guns is the lack of variety in terms of sound - there is a single suppressed sound for shotguns, and one for everything else. Combat is handled superbly well aside from one mid-game boss fight, which was confusing at first and came at the worst possible time.

But the gameplay isn't even the best part.

The atmosphere is intense - several levels were horror trips on par with Silent Hill or Amnesia - I had to stop twice just to get my head back together. Even when the game isn't trying to frighten you, it is absolutely oppressive. The world is every bit as detailed as BioShock Infinite's, yet instead tackles different themes.

The morality system plays a subtle role in the game, and the sheer amount of /depth/ to the writing and story is absolutely superb. I can not recall a single instance in the game where dialogue repeated, or a single patrol or encounter which had no unique dialogue or story to it. Everything I had done earlier in the game was referenced by people - alternately in awe of my accomplishments, or in hushed whispers of the atrocities I had unleashed.

There is one feature - hitherto unmentioned - which will harken to BioShock Infinite: But it's incredibly well done and only furthered my immersion in the game. For the first time in a long time, I genuinely cared for the characters, their struggles and their morals. This was not empathy, it was genuine sympathy.

I will play through it again - and don't buy into the **** about Ranger Mode. This is a classic, with or without it.",1368750418,1368750418,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is the theme that echoes throughout out Last Light on many different fronts and it is this which makes the journey compelling and sets it aside from so many games in the post-apocalyptic genre. There are some bumps in the story but most of this is because of sometimes weak character development (particularly Anna). As always, the atmosphere of Last Light steals the show and on Ranger mode (which I highly recommend) you can really immerse yourself completely - no HUD, crosshairs, UI, or hints. It's up to you to find your way, improvise, and track your ammo in the chamber of your gun. One of the subtle aspects of the game which really underlines its atmospheric value is the almost non-existent soundtrack; you hear critters scurrying about and your own breathing and heartbeat more often than you hear booming musical scores. Graphics, as though it needs to be said, are great and are rig-testing. Two words of warning, though: there are many cutscenes in the game and the checkpoint save system still quite frankly sucks.

Linear but with just enough freedom to engross yourself with the world the artists have created.  Metro Last Light picks 5 months after 2033 in the year 2034, Artyom has nightmares about the dark ones constantly.  He questions himself nightly whether or not wiping out tthe dark ones was for the good of man, or if it was another example of humanity's greed wiping out its competetors.  

The game itself is a pulse pounding action packed story where the stakes are high in combat and out of it.  You usually have two ways of overcoming your human opponents, stealth, or a bloody firefight.  Stealth is intense and often has you closely tailing guards through their patrol routes before dissapeering into the foggy blackness of the metro.

Combat with humans is always the fastest route, but it's the biggest gamble.  Frantically you will sprint from cover to cover, shooting out lights and gunning down enemies.  You will always be low on ammo, enemies do not take many shots to kill, but when you're on ranger mode, you have no way of telling what shot will be the last.  Eventually you will run out of ammo in the midst of a gunbattle with men closing in on your cover, panicked, you will run to the nearest corpse to rid him of his ammo or gun.

The plot is rich and engaging, with many suprises and shock along the way, however at times the twists do seem obvious and cheesy.  The Russian voice overs are incredible and offer a great level of belivability.  At times you feel as though you are watching some triple A film about humanity's condition.
