The game's story, which follows Peter as he balances his personal life with his superhero responsibilities, is engaging and well-paced, featuring a mix of familiar villains and new threats.

The gameplay is where Marvel's Spider-Man truly shines. Swinging through the city feels fluid and exhilarating, with a control scheme that's easy to pick up but offers plenty of depth for mastery. Combat is equally satisfying, with a variety of moves and gadgets at your disposal. The game's open-world design encourages exploration, and there are plenty of side activities and collectibles to keep you busy.

The remastered version on Steam looks and plays better than ever, with improved graphics and performance. The addition of all DLC content from the original release is a nice bonus, providing even more content to sink your teeth into.

Overall, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered is a must-play for fans of the superhero genre. It captures the essence of what makes Spider-Man such an iconic character while delivering a polished and enjoyable gaming experience. Whether you're swinging through the city or taking down bad guys, you'll find plenty to love in this game.",1700031475,1708872220,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

so as a gamer this game is amazing. is it perfect no not by any mean. 

so i am gonna break this down. main story its freaking amazing and stan lee would be proud. thank you insomniac for this amazing game. infamous was was a great combat and story telling game.\

pros
plenty of gadgets and consume perks. Even if you dont use them,  of course i did not. But the game has many perks. So bc of perks and gadgets there are so many fighting styles in the game. so i will tel you the main story is amazing. the dlc starts stong by falls flat.

For the hardcore anyhow if you want the game to challenge you i would suggest only competeing the main story in standard diffuiccly and the goin 100% in ultmate. i say that bc a single punch can take %25 of your health.

i would recommend this game to anyone, not just on sale. it is again another monument to what isomac can do with a sandbox game. infamous is still one of the best sandbox game i have ever played. know your abiltes and button standards. if you know these the game just becomes something else, not just fun but ..... you how about i let you decide.",1708846848,1708846848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think the story in the game is very well written, especially relation between Peter and another character such as MJ, Aunt May, Dr. Octo (my favorite),  black cat and also silver sable.

Genuinely one of the best single player triple A titles you can play on Steam, this game offers a ton of content easily justifying its price tag. You can genuinely just swing around New York for hours and not get bored; they really nailed the feeling of just getting to *be* Spider-Man. 

It's supremely replayable; I first played it in 2018 on ps4 and my replay on steam felt just as good as the first time, this time also doing the DLC. Combat feels mostly fair and rewarding; there's a satisfying response to landing blows, and there aren't *too* many quicktime events on bosses, but they are still present. Going for 100% can feel a little tedious, especially on the DLC, but is not required at all.

Overall, solid 10/10 game. I rarely enjoy modern triple A games but I'd play this again any day.",1708743905,1708743905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spider-Man Remastered for PC on Steam is a breathtaking adventure. This remastered edition not only brings the beloved superhero to life with stunningly detailed graphics and fluid animations but also elevates the entire experience to new heights with PC-optimized performance.

From the moment you launch the game, you're greeted with vibrant visuals that perfectly capture the bustling energy of New York City. The attention to detail in the game's environment is nothing short of spectacular, making each swing through the city's skyscrapers feel exhilarating. The game's lighting effects, especially during different times of the day, beautifully highlight the dynamic world Insomniac Games has created.

The gameplay in Spider-Man Remastered is a masterclass in design. Swinging through the city feels intuitive and satisfying, thanks to the refined mechanics and responsive controls optimized for PC. Combat is equally impressive, offering a fluid mix of acrobatics, web-slinging, and gadgetry that allows for a variety of playstyles. The remastered edition further enhances this experience with improved frame rates and resolutions, ensuring that every punch, swing, and leap looks and feels better than ever.

Narratively, Spider-Man Remastered tells a compelling story that captures the essence of Peter Parker's dual life. The voice acting and motion capture work are top-notch, bringing depth and emotion to each character. The story missions and side quests are well-crafted, balancing superhero antics with the personal struggles of Peter Parker, making for a deeply engaging storyline.

The PC version of Spider-Man Remastered also benefits from additional features such as customizable graphics settings, ultrawide monitor support, and ray tracing, which elevate the visual fidelity to a whole new level. The game runs smoothly on a wide range of hardware, thanks to well-optimized software that caters to different gaming rigs.

In conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered for PC on Steam is an absolute must-play. It successfully captures the thrill of being everyone's favorite web-slinger while delivering a polished and immersive gaming experience. On the negative side, it does have a lot of 'filler' quests and missions to do that can be a bit too much (chasing birds, unlocking satellites, finding backpacks, etc).

Game is really solid, boasting some of the best web swinging I've seen in these games. 
The story is highly engaging, even if they make Peter incredibly oblivious.
The games Arkham style combat is really engaging but a tad too easy. No fight even on the hardest difficulty NG+ brought much challenge to the games (especially the boss fights). Yet I'd be lying if getting 200+ combo isn't a hit of dopamine. 
However, the PC port is poorly optimised. Multiple times I had saves that would crash the game, alongside times the map tanked. Running it on lower settings helped but my PC can run most games on Ultra.
There's numerous bugs within fights, leading to enemies being stuck within objects or walls (sometimes making activities incompletable).
So overall I feel this game is really solid, a tad repetitive and not as brilliant as the hype made it out to be, but still brings brilliance to the table, being a fun 20+ hour run through (40+ if 100%).",1708271072,1708271072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Introduction:
Spider-Man Remastered swings onto the scene with a polished sheen, offering both die-hard fans and newcomers alike a chance to experience the thrilling adventures of the web-slinger in stunning detail. Developed by Insomniac Games, this remastered edition of the beloved title sets out to elevate an already fantastic experience to new heights, promising improved visuals, enhanced performance, and additional features. But does this updated rendition of Spidey's escapades deliver on its promises? Let's dive into the web of excitement and find out.

Graphics and Performance:
From the moment you leap off the tallest building and swing through the bustling streets of New York City, it's evident that Spider-Man Remastered is a visual masterpiece. The updated graphics breathe new life into every corner of the concrete jungle, with enhanced textures, lighting effects, and character models that showcase the power of the PlayStation 5 hardware. Whether you're scaling skyscrapers or engaging in heart-pounding combat, the game maintains a smooth framerate and fluid animations, immersing players in a seamless experience that never falters.

Gameplay and Mechanics:
Spider-Man Remastered retains the addictive gameplay that made its predecessor a standout hit, offering a perfect blend of exhilarating traversal and satisfying combat. Swinging through the city feels more intuitive than ever, thanks to responsive controls and improved web-slinging mechanics that allow for effortless acrobatics and aerial maneuvers. Combat, too, has seen refinements, with tighter controls and enhanced enemy AI adding depth to each encounter. Whether you're dispatching foes with a flurry of punches or utilizing Spidey's vast array of gadgets, every fight feels dynamic and engaging.

Story and Characters:
At its core, Spider-Man Remastered is a tale of heroism, sacrifice, and redemption, and it's brought to life by a cast of memorable characters and a gripping narrative. Peter Parker's journey as both a superhero and a struggling young adult is as compelling as ever, with heartfelt moments of triumph and tragedy that tug at the heartstrings. The game's supporting cast, including familiar faces like Mary Jane Watson and Miles Morales, are given ample time to shine, each contributing to the rich tapestry of Spider-Man's world.

Drawbacks:
However, amidst its many strengths, Spider-Man Remastered is not without its flaws. One notable drawback is the lack of substantial new content or significant gameplay enhancements beyond the graphical overhaul. While the improved visuals are undeniably impressive, some players may have hoped for additional missions, challenges, or gameplay mechanics to justify the remaster's existence. Some players may find the challenges, Spider-Man Remastered's version of side quests, to be a bit repetitive. Furthermore, despite the enhancements, occasional technical hiccups such as texture pop-in and minor framerate drops can still occur, detracting from an otherwise seamless experience.

Conclusion:
Spider-Man Remastered is more than just a visual upgrade; it's a love letter to one of Marvel's most iconic heroes, painstakingly crafted with care and attention to detail. From its breathtaking graphics to its addictive gameplay and captivating story, this remastered edition stands as a shining example of what a superhero game can achieve when done right. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the world of web-slinging, Spider-Man Remastered is an experience that demands to be played, offering countless hours of excitement, emotion, and above all, fun. With great power comes great responsibility, and Insomniac Games has once again proven themselves worthy of the mantle.",1708166711,1708166803,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

This is the definition of what video games should be, the stories it can tell, how it can move you, teach you, connect with you and inspire you.

First of all, the gameplay is great. The swinging feels amazing, it's really fun to just go from one point to another in the map. The combat is also great, it has enough depth to make it fun, while adding gadgets and other things that make it more interesting. The music is beautiful, and the graphics are superb.
Overall, the game is just really fun to play.

But the most important thing, is the story. This game has a story that includes growth, goodness and resilience. It has great dialogue, characterization and voice acting, but what truly matters is what the story is trying to say, what it is trying to tell you and show you. This is a story that makes you admire its characters, feel the emotions they are feeling, and learn from the experiences they face.
This is what videogames should strive to be, a medium to tell a story or share and experience that leaves an impact on the player.
One that inspires you, teaches you, connects with you and makes you feel something.

Everything down to the NPC design is astonishing. The web swinging, the city, the sounds, mechanics, and narrative are masterfully crafted. This is an amalgamation of every good thing to ever come out of a webhead's game amplified x20, stripped of all the hiccups, while adding several new layers to the way you engage. Insomniac really gave new life to Spidey in the realm of gaming. 

The story is a character study or sorts. A journey of an already established hero at a crossroads that consists of epiphany and revelation. Serious with a few. Mentor to some. Friend to all. The dynamic between MJ and Pete was also a breath of fresh air. Through my little subjective lens, Mary Jane's character is best in her element when she's outside of the damsel in distress archetype. The antagonists, (especially Otto) were outstanding. Miles is the Cherry on top.

Exciting. Original. Heartfelt.

Fighting is seamless & extremely satisfying. Implementation of an Arkham style combat system was 110% the way to go. Even though it's very similar to the Arkhamverse's here - it still manages to establish it's own identity through the agile acrobatic move-sets and various combinations of web gadgets. Swinging with the quick zipping mechanic is such an engaging feature when it comes to combos.

Lastly, the environment and level design are breathtaking. Found myself at moments in time, atop random NYC high rises, just taking it all in. Buildings, weather, city life, (especially rooftops) are full of vitality. Did I mention the addictive swinging?

Pros:
1. Fun web swinging when it's working for you and not against you. 
2. OK combat. (see more below)
3. A story. Sort of... (see more below)
4. Not bad graphics. Skin and faces are pretty well done.

Meh:
1. Pedestrians/AI are passable. Once you play for a while you start noticing how shallow/dumb they actually are.
2. OK combat. Lets be real you really just hit square/X a bunch between hitting the R1 button where your web gadgets are. There's a selection of gadgets and suit powers and a few modifications you can do but once you find the combo that works the best you just kind of ignore the rest unless a challenge forces you to use them.
3. A story. Not so much of a story as a bunch of little short stories thrown together. The villains were kind of lame and I just didn't care for them or their story. Apparently the story will continue in Miles Morales but I didn't finish remastered in time to know If I wanted to play the sequel(s) to catch it on sale so I'm not going to buy it/them yet. 
4. No Avengers cameo's? Missed opportunity! 

Cons:
1. Very short game with not a whole lot of content. I'm usually the player that will explore the entire map before continuing to the main story area and I basically finished everything in 44 hours. Satisfied I suppose, but only because I got the game at 50% off. 
2. DLC 2 or 3 or 4 my PS4 controller (on PC) something in the game programming makes doing finishing moves and suit powers a 50/50 chance instead of working perfectly like they did the rest of the game. This is for any type of controller I read on the internet. It can make getting good scores in challenges nearly impossible but it's not going to break your game. It'll piss you off when you're trying to hit L3 + R3 surrounded by 20 enemies and it's just not F'ing working!!!! You'll get past it though and it's ONLY when you get into DLC 2/3/4. It works perfectly the rest of the game. 
3. PC crashes. The later into the game I got, the more often it seemed to crash. The type of crash where the game is running perfectly and without any warning at all the game just closes itself and an error report pops up. Again, annoying, but it only happened a grand total of maybe 10 times. Auto-save saves your ass most of the time and it only really stings if you're on wave 6/6 of a hideout that you've already failed at 4 times already.

Spider-Man Remastered has not only swung its way into my heart but has redefined what it means to experience the life of everyone's favorite web-slinger. Insomniac Games has delivered a remaster that not only pays homage to the original masterpiece but elevates it to new heights with stunning visuals and enhanced gameplay.

The first thing that grabs your attention is the jaw-dropping visual overhaul. From the intricacies of Spider-Man's suit to the bustling streets of New York City, every detail is meticulously crafted. The ray tracing, improved textures, and enhanced lighting bring the iconic city to life like never before, creating a visual feast that's both nostalgic and breathtaking.

The fluidity of the web-swinging and acrobatics is where Spider-Man Remastered truly shines. The controls are responsive and intuitive, making navigation through the city a sheer joy. The addition of the haptic feedback on controllers adds an extra layer of immersion, making every swing and combat move feel more dynamic and engaging.

The revamped character models and animations contribute to a more cinematic experience, deepening the emotional connection to the story. The voice acting remains top-notch, capturing the essence of each character and immersing players in Spider-Man's world.

The inclusion of the three additional suits, each with its own unique abilities, is a welcome addition for both returning fans and newcomers. The attention to detail in the suit designs and the nod to Spidey's rich comic book history showcases the love and passion Insomniac Games has for the source material.

The overall performance and optimization of Spider-Man Remastered are commendable. The game runs smoothly, and load times are significantly reduced, ensuring a seamless and immersive experience that keeps you in the action.

In conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered is not just a remaster; it's a love letter to Spider-Man fans. Insomniac Games has taken an already outstanding title and polished it to perfection, making it a must-play for both fans of the original and newcomers eager to experience the web-slinging adventure in its most refined form. Grab your web-shooters and swing into action – this remaster is an absolute triumph! 🕷️🕸️🏙️🌟",1708006570,1708006570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With the release of Spider-Man Remastered for PS4, PS5 and PC, Insomniac Studio brings the beloved adventure to a new platform, promising enhanced graphics, smoother gameplay and an immersive experience for players.

VIsually, the game takes full advantage of modern hardware, offerering stunning graphics with crisp textures, detailed character models and vibrant environments by applying the latest graphic technology. From the skycrappers to the bustling streets and every corner of each cities feels alive and immersive, inviting players to explore its intricacies, and one of the most significant improvement for the PC version is the crashing issues, sometimes plays smoothly and crashes continuously due to the hardware temperature and performance although my hardware has reach beyond the recommended game's specification.

But it's not just the visuals that received an upgrade; Spider-Man Remastered introduces a host of improvements and new features that make the gameplay experience even more enjoyable. The addition of haptic feedback on the DualSense controller adds a tactile dimension to swinging and combat, making each punch and web-slinging motion feel more impactful and responsive.

It wouldn't be a Spider-Man game without an engaging story, and Remastered delivers on this front as well. The narrative remains as compelling as ever, weaving together elements of action, humor, and heartfelt emotion that capture the essence of Spider-Man's journey. Whether you're battling classic villains like Doctor Octopus or unraveling the mysteries of Peter Parker's personal life, the story never fails to captivate.

One of the most significant additions to Spider-Man Remastered is the inclusion of all three DLC story chapters from the original game, seamlessly integrated into the main campaign. This provides even more content for players to sink their teeth into, further expanding upon the rich tapestry of Spider-Man's world. In addition to technical enhancements, Spider-Man Remastered on PC includes all the content from the original PlayStation release, including the base game and all three DLC story chapters. This means players can experience the full breadth of Spider-Man's adventures, from battling classic villains to delving into Peter Parker's personal struggles, all in one comprehensive package.

As I mentioned above, Spider-Man Remastered on PC is not without its drawbacks. Some players have reported encountering technical issues, including performance hiccups, crashes, and optimization issues on certain hardware configurations. While these issues may be addressed through future patches and updates, they can detract from the overall experience for some players.

Despite these minor drawbacks, Spider-Man Remastered on PC delivers an exhilarating and immersive superhero experience that fans of the genre won't want to miss. With its stunning visuals, smooth gameplay, and comprehensive content, it's a must-play for anyone looking to step into the shoes of the legendary web-slinger and swing through the streets of New York City like never before.

Here is the point I gave in this game:
Graphics: 10 for quality and 7 for performance (sometimes has technical issues including performance hiccups, crashes, and optimization issues on certain hardware configurations despite the beyond specification). The overall for the graphic point is 8.5 (I point it as the 9 )

Story: 10

Gameplay: 10 

The average point = (9 + 10 + 10) / 3 is almost 9.67 so I gave this game total 10 point",1708004740,1708004740,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

I will say for some reason my Steam achievements won't unlock after certain side missions. For example I collected every backpack in the game, yet I do not have the achievement for it. Same with Black Cat and the Research Stations. Pretty much the achievements related to 100% don't unlock meaning you don't get the validation that I so obviously crave.

The only time consuming part of platinum was the extra playtrough achievements

Story is amazing, but it wouldn't hurt if it was longer (9.5/10)
Gameplay is good, webswinging is veru satisfying, but combat is no challenge, even on the hardest difficulty (9/10/10)
Graphics are good, but some areas of the map are kind of boring due to the colors of the buildings (8.5/10)

Overall (9/10)

The game runs alright on Steam Deck, the combat is totally playable, the traversel not so much

At this point Playstation Studios should release all PS exlusives to pc

*UPDATE* (February 12th, 2024)
I have learned the game after you unlock the Sinister Six, it is very prone to being buggy. It can go from straight up crashing, to freezing all together, to just frame drops. Can get very annoying, but overall doesn't change how I feel about the game.

I couldn't recommend a game like that to a friend and have it on my conscience if they did lose their progress after hours of play.

The Good: The basic fighting is fast-paced and satisfying. It moves fast enough that you don't have a lot of time to think about what you're doing, which means you have to learn to internalise a strategy. As the fights get harder you're also unlocking new tools to help you handle things in new ways that you roll into your strategy and you have to get more flexible as the different sets of enemies and environments makes for a wide diversity of fights. The story is compelling as well, I haven't been brought to tears yet but the character relationships do regularly hit me in the feels.

The Bad: The boss fights are disappointing in that they all seem designed to be solved in a particular way. You have to check the boxes properly or you won't advance. The first boss fight for example there are a pair of huge turrets firing at you, once you realise it's signalling that you need to rip them out you need to time doing so between their bursts of fire. I thought I was clever, I went to one side to line them up so that one couldn't shoot me making it easy to time between the remaining turret's bursts. However then you can't rip it out from there, you need to stand in the middle to do that so that it can do the cinematic cut of the turret being thrown at the villain.

The Ugly: Crashes on save load, the worst time to crash because it means that you've essentially lost that save. I lost 2 hours the first time this happened when I died, I had to revert to my manual save slot which I started the night from. I started saving manually more often after that but then next time both the autosave and the manual slot were crashing. I poked around and reverted to the previous game version via the Steam beta menu and thankfully the save loaded fine. I got into this situation again and rolled forward to the current version and got around it, but I'm in constant fear that won't work. I now keep 2 alternating manual save slots, but I shouldn't need to do be so defensive of my saves.",1707452122,1707452122,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A long time ago, open world games started crop up more and more. The formula, arguably made popular by Assasssin's Creed, was translated into IP after IP. And all the games follow it to a T:
1. Create a fun gameplay loop
2. Have a big map 
3. Fill it with repeatable activities 
5. Try and find a balance between teedeum and enjoyment by skinnerboxing the [h1]shit[/h1] out of it.

All open world games follow this formula. Sure there might be some exceptions, but overall: from Far Cry to Shadow of Mordor, from Assassin's Creed to Horizon... they all do the. Same. Exact. Thing. 

So what makes Spider-man really enjoyable time? 

Well, first off the gameplay: this is where Spider-man shines. It's core gameplay loop is fantastic. It's ... very polished. Everything feels fun! Well... almost everything, but we'll get to that. 

Swinging feels fantastic. Going from one corner of the map to the other, is enjoyable in itself to the point that when fast travel is unlocked, you never actually want to use it. I've only found myself using it on my second play-through and only at the very end. There are several traversal mechanics that complement each other to actually give you different ways of getting from point A to point B, allowing the player to vary it up and never actually be bored with it. 

The combat, isn't anything to write home about: it's the free flow system. But it's polished. The gadgets are fun to use. The suit powers you unlock are diverse, creating different play-styles and the unlocks you get. The RPG tacked on Talent Tree also creates a feeling of progression. 

The issue  - and when I say Issue i mean it's what stops the game from being a masterpiece - is the contextualization of gameplay. They try and give in game reasons for the unlocking of gadgets, but it all feels forced. Talents are not even contextualized. This is Peter Parker well into his career, so he shouldn't still be ""learning moves"". Again, it's minor. Most games don't even bother with contextualizing gameplay. But great games do and do it well. Spider-man is just... kinda there. 

The collectables and activities on the map.... are a lot. OverWHELMINGLY so. The map opens up really quick, in fact from the first moment of the game you can go ANYWHERE. DON'T do what I did. When the ""towers"" become unlocked, I just went around the map finishing ALL the towers. Then a new side activity showed up. And then another. And another and another. Progress the story a bit. Then clean out the map. I ended up cleaning out the map in my first playthrough at least 5 times.

The reason being is that - I think - they found the perfect balance between Map size/ traversal enjoyment / fun activities. All activities are fun. And they never really outstay their welcome. I only started getting bored towards the finish of the second play-through. 

So to summarize, remove the story, and the game play is worth it just on it's on. You can ignore the  story and just have fun being Spider-man doing spider-man things in New York. 

There is one big issue: the one part of the gameplay that feels ... annoying. It's when you don't play as Spider-man. Playing as the side-non hero characters is... boring and tedious. Small stealth sections that, you realize don't require that much stealth. It's sort of padding, as they are kind of essential to the story, but i think they could have been removed. I think the point was to get to play as the side characters. To try and connect with them. Personally, no thank you. I came here to play Spider-man. 

However... if the first topic was gameplay, Story is the second. It's a great Spider-man story. Mind you, there are quite a few forced moments, in order to set up events, reveals. In fact, if the story has any real weakness, i'd say it has to be it's predictability. Realistically every single plot point you see coming, being telegraphed a mile away. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, more of a preference thing. There are no surprises. But what is given, is solid. It's a solid story, with great characterization, great performances and - despite predictable - great payoffs. No spoilers but Yuri Lowenthal's performance, especially in it's emotional climax, is the best performance an acted Spider-man has received in any medium. 

So, as a conclusion
It's a great game. Even at full price. You see it discounted at more than 25%, it's a steal! I Don't platinum games, because I can't be bothered. I was bothered with this. I played the entire thing, twice, on the hardest difficulty, just because it was fun to do. 

It's not a masterpiece, i reserve that for a special class of games, games that manage to create a synergy between, story and gameplay that is rarely reached. But it's really close. It's 70+ hours of fun.

Edit: The sequel is garbage. Don't bother. And i mean both Miles Morals and 2. ",1669918604,1707438632,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics, the swinging mechanics, all ported quite good for a PS port and I dont completely regret buying it for full price. 

But now the bad, the performance is slopy, it started out fine but at certain point it just dropped FPS like a video buffering on bus wifi, especially during hard fights this was noticable and annoying. Another kind of bad thing, although I can fogive it since its industry standard is rather boring bossfights, every boss has a tactic and spidey has a set of moves during cutscenes, which you just switch between, bit of swinging, some webshooting and same three moves and then back to swinging. Once its noticable it becomes boring as its just waiting to do enough to move on.

1. The stealth game play needs some work.
     - like being able to get off a perched ledge without jumping super high/swinging to another 
       grab point
     - or climb to the top of a building and be able to stop yourself on the ledge and not jump 30 
       feet in the air.  
     - Or even getting off a buildings ledge to land on the roof - you have to jump everywhere
     - and lastly, the stealth button indicators were very spotty for me

These are very minuscule, but also was very frustrating when forced to do missions in stealth

2. If I click 'Retry' after a challenge, my game almost always crashes.  If not the first time the definitely the 2nd.  I tried changing all the settings I could, lowered graphics, turn off DLSS, turn off all the extra stuff and it still continues to happen and it most certainly is not hardware.

First off, too many concessions for console play.
the controls on every level were more wet and mushy than a 3 day old diaper. 'combat actions' relied on introducing new keys for every action rather than a logical set of simple controls.
The physics were absolute crap. 5 minutes of web-swinging in the city and you knew all about it. No controlled anchors, constant scripted movement in battle scenes, as well as scripted twitch combat. No anchoring whatsoever, even web-swinging felt like playing a hover game with minor 'webswinging' tweaks.

[b] I finished the game for the second time on the hardest difficulty (+ 1 completed on ps4) and I have to say the remastered version really brought the game to perfection  [/b] 

[u] everything from the swinging mechanic to the combat system fits perfectly [/u]

[i] the story is very well done so I really enjoy it,  the side characters seem very characteristic 
which I greatly appreciated because we see them for several times with a different faces and voices  [/i] 
[u] the game is set in its own game universe. [/u]
[i] the city feels believable and is full of side quests and activities. (some activities may seem repetitive) [/i]
completing the achievement is not difficult and its enjoyable 
 in terms of sound, the game is also very good, the music is <3 
the game is controlled very well especially with the dualsense controller, adaptive vibration and haptic response is perfect. [/hr]
 with my ryzen 3600 and rtx 2060 i played the game stably at 60fps on high settings with raytracing.

[u] mods can bring you many more hours of fun, from the suit to the fighting and swinging animations, fans there making perfect works, I've tried a lot of them myself. [/u]

I had this rated as 6.9/6.9 but upon more playtime it's more like a 3.5/6.9.
My reason being: once you encounter SABLE tech, fights become all about spamming gadgets and hiding. You are not going to be able to dodge every attack because the movement is not fluid. The dudes with jetpacks and rocket launchers will shoot at you right when you get stunned or attacked by another enemy killing you instantly. It's so much more fun to fight the regular enemies rather than dodging or using a gadget in between every punch. I liked the beginning of the game a lot, but towards the end they have enemies that are not enjoyable to fight due to the movement being very wonky when in combat.

Don't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and fun, it has many mechanics.

But sadly it gets very repetitive when start to grind all the trophies, the crimes are being almost the same, enemies are just differently skinned models with the same behaviours (I mean the factions), there is nothing unique.

Game mostly gets harder by upping the enemies health or giving them more options that they block your attacks.

The story is really cool and I am looking forward to playing the next game of the series, but due to being so tired by repetitive tasks I am not sure I will be maxing it too.

the pacing is weird as well like im 80 something % complete i've got every collectable only 3 prison camps and 4 sable bases to destroy then i have the story to get through im that far in yet the sinister six is just now involved in the story i can understand why this was done because you don't want to play your cards early you gotta know when to hold em & know when to fold em and thats why the sinister six shoulda been added in act 2 not 3 but buy it if you like repetition,bugs,glitches,etc. there's good stuff like stealth was kinda fun its hilarious to spam throwables at enemy's and swings is fun its slower at the start but as you level up it gets more fun but it's a good game dlcs are great and fuck screwball so annoying",1698198890,1706881602,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

Well actually it's just another MARVEL game, where you must save the city. It's logical (most of times), understandable. But entire game you rescue someone, and beating ""bad"" guys

Characters +1 point
Peter is so Peter. Well, actually I really enjoy his unbreakable will to help someone, to see good in people, trying to reach on villans. I've red plenty comics book of SM, and in this game, we didnt see any difference of typical comix.
But if we talk about villians. Well that is what developing character is look like (except how fast this happening). And Black Cat is cute.

Gameplay +1 point
Fighting system is pretty easy and intuitive. Gadgets, combos, and most of it, flying is pretty easy and nice

Elaboration of the world +1
You have plenty of side missons. Game dont even make it difficult and just plants it in a map. And some these collects might make you laugh or sad, and even more unfold you Parker's previous life.

Graphics +1 point
Have no doubt. View of the city is wonderful

Stylistics +1 point
Armors on villians on the end of the game look really cool. And so much costumes of sm can make you individual interes. I actually have a question to Parker, why he carries so many of them all the time...

Music +1 point
Especially fight music and main. You really believe this IS SPIDER MAN notes

Optimization 0 point
Well actually the game have more bugs than you wish. Some of them not so scary. Yet some of them can make you restart the game even from previous savefile.

Modes, side quests +1 point
DLC's is quite interesting. Especially side quest with paintings. I have really enjoyed.

Personal influence +1 points
The plot and a nature of Parker might help you relax and believe you can make it through any hard punch your life makes.

Web-slinging across New York never gets old (though I do recommend mods), and the way you can visit and climb anywhere and everywhere is certainly fun. The characters are fun, if not one-dimensional. This game has a lot of love put in, and you can feel the developers took care to honor the character and its world.

However, the mission design, compared to the rest of the game is outdated. Side quests consist of you going to somewhere and beating enemies there, or going somewhere and catching stuff there. Boring collectibles, repetitive side missions, mind-numbing challenges, all contribute to the game becoming stale for me as I played longer.

The Good
The story was really good. I didn’t expect it to be that good but it was.

Miles is my favourite character in this game.

The graphics were really good. I never truly played a game at 4k until now and it was quite an amazing experience.

The gameplay was really good. 

The accessibility options are really good. Being able to skip the puzzles was so great. And being able to hold to tap was good too. Tapping would hurt my carpel tunnel hands.

The game was easy.

There a ton of unlockable that you can get.

There was one part in the game where you had to face rhino and scorpion, and the way that the scene was composed was so awesome. It was a fight in the rain on some dock, and a red spiderman is in the foreground, a grey rhino is to the right, and to the very back left is a green scorpion. It made me think of how much work that went into the game to have the scorpion crouching on some container looking like and actual scorpion. It was cool to see.

You can save whenever you want.

The games save folder keeps backup save files.

The game didn’t take long to beat which is a breath of fresh air for me. Many AAA games take so long to beat and they are almost always never worth your time. Also, I occasionally lost track of time while playing this game, which meant that I was immersed in the game and was having a lot of fun progressing the story.


The Bad
If you save during a mission and then quit the game to go do life stuff, your save file will get corrupted and crash when you load it up. Manually, saving after and before missions is mandatory. And backing up your saves should be mandatory too.

If you don’t do a good job on a challenge and want to retry, the game will crash. If you try to continue from the main menu, your game will crash. You will need to use your last manual save to continue to play the game. Only way to get out of the challenge is to just not retry and then go back to station and do it again.

Sometimes fast travelling will crash the game and you cannot continue your save from the main menu. You will need to use your last manual save to continue the game. I believe this happens when you try to fast travel during a mission.

The game is kind of buggy. Sometimes weird stuff will happen. Like sometimes you’ll have to reload your last checkpoint because the game softlocks itself and won’t let you complete a kill all the enemies for the story mode even though you did.

I thought that the DLC was bad. It felt like a Saturday morning cartoon of your favourite show but it wasn’t a regular 3 part episode, it was just a 3 part filler episode. In my opinion, this DLC sucked. I didn’t like the white haired woman who I thought left for good, and I didn’t like the predictable black cat story. And I didn’t like the last boss battle. It was tedious and a chore to beat that boss.


Conclusion
I think the base game for this spiderman game was amazing and I really enjoyed it. I’m not sure if I’ll ever play this game again but I have a good memory of it.",1706426780,1706426780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Insomniac has nailed what makes Spidey so cool and has translated that into incredibly fun gameplay mechanics.  Story-wise it's nothing that special but it is mostly reverent in its treatment of the various Spider-man characters.  The only real nitpick I could make are the lame Mary Jane Watson and Miles Morales stealth missions, which not only feel out of place in some ways but which also (unfortunately) break up the fun Spider-man action to slow things down by forcing you to play as boring characters.  

People are playing this game to be Spider-man, not Mary Jane Watson, Insomniac.  SMH

Anyway, that is really the only complaint I can come up with, honestly.  The Spidey traversal and web-slinging is fantastically done and just feels perfect.  A few times combat got a bit over-the-top in its difficulty levels and what they expected from the player but thanks to the smart addition of an adjustable difficulty level, that wasn't a major frustration, otherwise I'd have knocked off some points from my scoring.
(If only the over-rated Souls games would learn from this idea.)

Great game, well worth your money and time.  Highly recommended just remember that there are some occasional slower, maybe even more boring stealth missions that clutter up the game flow from time to time.  The farther in the game you go, though, the less intrusive and clunky they feel, so that's something anyway.

Spider-Man Remastered not only pays homage to the beloved comic book character but also elevates the overall superhero gaming experience. The well-crafted narrative, enhanced by top-notch voice acting by Yuri Lowenthal (robbed at the game awards this year), propels players into the dual life of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. The inclusion of all downloadable content add extra layers to an already rich experience. For fans and newcomers alike, Spider-Man Remastered is a must-play title that seamlessly combines stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and an authentic portrayal of one of Marvel's most iconic characters.",1705946522,1705946522,True,25,2,0.726773679256439209,3,True,False,False

The story is an emotional rollercoaster that any Spider-Man, or really anyone can enjoy.  You become emotionally invested in the characters and you start to feel like Peter Parker as the story unfolds.

Webslinging through the city is amazing when you first experience it, and it never gets old.

Graphically that game is just gorgeous.  I played on my Steam Deck and I have zero complaints.  I didn't experience any issues and everything moved fluidly.

The writing is fun, the story is focused and snappy and has very little dead air, and most importantly, the gameplay is super fun. You feel like spiderman. I think there's a fast travel system in this game, but I can honestly say I never used it. Travelling between objectives is great. Swinging from a building mid mission to tie up some muggers is great. Dodging rockets and throwing turrets is great.

I was very much looking forward to this, but now I really wouldn't recommend touching it without a pretty big discount and a lot of time you want to kill. Not exactly bad, but generally just fairly dull and repetitive.

The best thing about it is often the traversal. Swinging through the city can be very fun and engaging, but achieving a whole lot of precision with it can be a challenge. The barrier to entry is holding down a button, but getting exactly where you want to get can be a challenge.

Combat is probably the most annoying thing overall. It's alright in small doses, but the game really likes sticking to a formula of sending six waves of repetitive goons at you to pad the time. The mechanics are also not nearly as polished as we've grown to expect from Arkham games. You run into undodgeable attacks, zero warnings and in some missions, enemies that are so broken that they manage to hug you into a lock from as far as 3 to 4 meters away. I recall actually really enjoying long fights in Batman games because the counters were well times, you didn't feel screwed by chance and adding up those combo would build up momentum and power, that you could also unleash with a power attack. In this game you just hope something won't screw you up on wave 6. Especially not an enemy stuck in a wall and impossible to kill.

The game design suffers from being very specific in how it wants things done and doesn't trust the player to work it out by themselves. There's a lot of handholding and tutorial prompts don't wait a microsecond before telling you which button to press. Look for a vent. Press this. Shoot a web. Jump to the ceiling. Look for another vent. Boss fights suffer from this a lot. You will wait for special attack, you will dodge left, you'll shoot to close in and punch repeatedly. Now do this five more times because we're out of ideas. You get gadgets and no room to figure out how to use them in creative ways.

Writing is hit and miss. There's good acting in there, but it's recycling the usual suspects and you're rarely out of your comfort zone. Plenty of comic book logic and Deus Ex Machina. At least we were mostly spared another Uncle Ben.

The game is open world, but doesn't appear to know what to do about it. There's a single thread main story and it unlocks additional stuff to do. Burglary events, landmarks to visit, challenges. Very basic stuff, but if you happen to be someone who likes to get secondary content out of the way before pushing the story, the game will actively punish you with ""Now to kill some time"". It won't give you the next story mission and will expect you to go do something else, that at this point would be sitting on your ass for five minutes. There's the Jamerson radio host that periodically broadcasts rather amusing rants, but at least half of these were interrupted by random stuff happening around. I think you can replay them from the menu, but that's just frustrating.

Port wise, it runs great on a high end machine, but the crashes are real. Think I must've had one every 3 to 4 hours. There's also quite a few scripting problems, like enemies stuck in walls, character races where the opponent wouldn't move half the time, car chases that happened without the car actually driving. Sometimes the game wants you to take a picture, but the button to draw the camera won't work. Sometimes you get where you need to be, but nothing happens and you feel like an idiot, when it's just game script that failed to trigger the next bit. Exiting to main menu and reloading is something you get used to.",1705854785,1705854785,False,2,1,0.519841313362121582,2,True,False,False

Quite thorough accessibility options combined with a now pretty thriving mod scene that allows you to add costumes, change animations, voice files, or music, swap the lighting for a more comic-booky tone, etc., means this has become a game that truly lets you play YOUR Spider-man YOUR way.

Some important stuff up first: this game is a RAM hog on Windows, and a battery hog on Steam Deck, but otherwise runs very well on both. Also, the Steam Deck is going to get VERY warm while playing. I recommend playing while plugged in, and ideally not in bed where it's surprisingly easy to get blasted in the face by the utter SIROCCO of a wind streaming out of the Deck's air vent.

I shall not be following my own advice because, well, ""do as I say, not as I do.""

Now the meat of the review. 

This is the Spider-man that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko meant to write, with characterizations for all the major characters that treat them as human beings in all their messed up glory. It's nice seeing Norman Osborn in particular FINALLY receive a much more multifaceted portrayal here. And that's just one example. This game's take on Peter Parker, Aunt May, and MJ stand among the all-time bests, and I'm saying that as someone who very much does not typically like Mary Jane Watson much at all. This main cast of characters is a celebration of Spidey's history, past and present, and no main character feels in any way reduced or simplified -- each one takes inspiration from all of their past portrayals, but Insomniac still puts their own spin on each one.

So, let's now get the bad out of the way, I guess. I say ""major"" characters because bosses like Electro, Vulture, Scorpion, and Rhino all get very little personality at all, and amount to nothing more than speed bumps the player faces on their way to more interesting and emotionally invested confrontations. Then there's Hammerhead, the villain of the City That Never Sleeps DLC campaign who is... a johnny-one-note mafioso who believes in strength through violence for violence's sake and that's really all there is to his character. After getting incredibly nuanced main villains in the vanilla campaign like Doc Ock and Mr. Negative, playing CTNS after it all just felt like an endless series of disappointments as a result, especially given the extra highlighting that Screwball gets -- and if ever there was something in this game that would get me to NOT recommend it, it would be Screwball. 

Fortunately Screwball's mission in the vanilla campaign is, if not the shortest, mercifully straightforward, and the vast majority of her (significantly more numerous) DLC missions are all largely optional content. If only she was, you know, totally absent. She seems to have been written by someone who has HEARD of Twitch streamers but isn't too sure what they actually are, but has decided they hate them, and wants YOU to hate them just as much. And after the Calypso Twins from Borderlands 3 similarly landing that dynamic with all the skill and execution of a wet fart, I was hoping to never again see the ""Evil Twitch Streamer"" villain archetype again, but alas, here she is, arrived one more time to vex me further. 

There's also the much reviled MJ and Mile Morales stealth missions, which are less ""stealth"" and more ""timing and positioning"" puzzles, but tbh, they aren't THAT bad, they are relatively easy, and they mostly go pretty quickly, Rhino's ""chase of goose"" (that he hates) notwithstanding. The worst thing about them is they take you out of your rhythm as Spider-man and you spend most of their run WISHING you were still Spider-man.

Damn, I guess I probably have made this positive review sound downright negative for all the yapping I've been doing about parts I don't like. To err is human. 

Fortunately, that extended bit of griping aside, this is an immaculate Spider-man game. Traversal has never felt cleaner and more stylish, the combat is tight and VERY well executed, the story is one hell of an emotional roller coaster about past traumas and how if left unresolved and unaddressed they can become literal demons that derail our lives, and the biggest complaint I have left is that once you find your groove, it all goes SO MUCH FASTER than you want it to. Thank god for New Game Plus. Manhattan is a gorgeous playground that's beautifully rendered, even on low settings, even if it's a playground that no longer feels as expansive and huge as it did in the PS2 era when it was first used as a wide open sandbox. I do wish we got to see more of NYC than just its most famous bit, but what's here is lovingly crafted, gorgeous, and fun as hell to swing through and knock the teeth out of thugs, terrorists, fascist mercenaries, and supervillains in. 

Said teeth-knocking follows the Arkham formula of basic combos, dodges, and counters mixed with some gadgets and finishers, but that formula has never felt quite so POWERFUL as it does here. Combat will seldom feel stale or unwelcome, and it's been adapted quite well to a hero of Spider-man's agility. You will feel like you are in control of a comic book the whole time, and that's honestly what this whole game is about.

I give this four ""not-quite-stealth missions"" out of five.",1705685147,1705791642,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The story is good and features lots of cool moments featuring some of the classic villains and most of the characters are likeable and voice acting is great. The side missions are average, some of them good but most of them boring.  I found most of the boss fights a bit underwhelming, I feel that it could have been a lot better but there are some good boss fights too. I really enjoyed the increase in difficulty in the dlc also, the game just throws everything it has got at you, and it was much faster paced than the main story.

These are some of the negatives / Issues I faced

1. The Mary Jane missions and hacking puzzles felt like a speed breaker and felt super boring.
2. In screwball challenge missions the game had difficulty getting inputs from ps5 controller right, couldn't use the finishers   and occasionally there were issues with swinging also.
3. The game crashed occasionally, more times in the dlc part.
4. Average side missions. However the dlc side missions were less and better than the ones in the main campaign.
5. Occasional bugs where enemies you attack just disappear.

I would rate this game a 3.5/5. It is a bit overrated. I didn't like it as much as I thought I would but its definitely a good game.",1705667327,1705697690,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like the Arkham games, you'll probably this. However, unlike the Arkham games, the combat is far less fluid for a start;  the stealth, while there, isn't really that good, as you're still expected to fight as opposed to reaping the satisfaction of stealthing areas like an apex sexual predator.

The biggest downside, though, is when you have to play several missions as either Mary-Jane Rotten-Crotch, or George Floyd.

Web-Slinging & Visual Spectacle: 5/5
The sheer joy of swinging through the cityscape as Spider-Man is unparalleled. The fluidity of movement and attention to detail in the remastered visuals elevate the experience to new heights. Each swing feels like a choreographed dance, and the revamped graphics are a treat for the eyes. From the reflective surfaces of skyscrapers to the intricate design of Spidey's suit, the graphical fidelity brings New York City to life.

Combat Dynamics & Storytelling: 4/5
Combat sequences are a dazzling display of acrobatics and strategic prowess. The combo system and gadget utilization provide a satisfying depth to battles. The story, a compelling blend of superhero drama and personal struggles, keeps you invested in Peter Parker's journey. While some narrative beats feel familiar, the execution and voice acting elevate the overall storytelling experience.

Performance Swings High: 4/5
While the game demands a bit of graphical prowess, my gaming rig managed to keep up admirably. Some minor hiccups aside, the smooth web-swinging and breathtaking cityscapes make it a minor trade-off for the overall visual feast. The day-night cycle and weather effects further contribute to the dynamic nature of Spider-Man's world.

Conclusion
Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is not just a game; it's a superhero simulator. From the heart-pounding action to the jaw-dropping visuals, it successfully captures the essence of being Spider-Man. Swing into the revamped world of Peter Parker and relish in the superhero experience it flawlessly delivers.",1705500196,1705500196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Last of Us didn't plague me (no pun intended) with a fraction of what this game put me through.  The crashes are so entirely random and that's the worst part.  Crash at startup, Crash AFTER startup, Crash at quick travel, Crash at a challenge, Crash while swinging around, Crash in mid battle, Crash in a challenge, Crash to the desktop, or just total system crashing is just not a good look.  Nothing will kill an immersive experience faster for a player more than a plague of bugs in a game.",1705452683,1705452683,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is AWSOME!!
Story and characters are well written.
Web swinging feels AMAZING and is one of the reasons why this game is sooo good.
Combat is well made, kinda similar to Arkhams combat but in involves gadgets, and web swinging/attacks which differentiate it from Arkhams combat.
This game runs fairly well, even thought it's ported from PS5
There are a lot of alternate costumes so you can look hover you like, and you can always add mods for extra suits

[h1] Negatives: [/h1]
Graphics aren't bad but sometimes game looks weird, lack of AO on people, textures being blurred in scripted scenes, and reflections in some scenarios look weirdly
[strike] No sex with black cat [/strike]

There’s no reason to pass on this if you are into adventure games, as it stands, it’s a solid port, the definitive version of this hit action-adventure game.

The narrative is reinforced by a solid bit of world building, the streets of New York feel alive as pedestrians go about their business, the representation of day, night and in-between especially emphasized the verisimilitude of spidey’s neighborhood. 

The combat is proficient and is easily bouncing from opponent to opponent, a nice list of unlockable skills and gadgets bolsters an already decent move set. Even if you’re not a massive fan of superheroes, Spider-Man Remastered has a narrative with story beats that many will be able to enjoy and relate to, it’s the most realistic Spider-Man experience out of the comics.

However, it has it's flaws as everything, if you play it a while, you'll start to see its failures, in short, Spider-Man's open world design is a missed opportunity,  isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, but as an open world it is very oriented to the main mission, you can't interact with what it could have to offer, the high bar set in the main plot shines a harsher light on the rest of the game's activities, these don't have the same narrative energy as the main throughline, some of the side quests with the time passed might get tedious, but most of what is available entertains thanks to how great it feels to be Spider-Man. This is especially true when it comes to the more action-oriented segments and running around the city.

The worse segment of the game is when you'll be playing as MJ or Miles Morales. 
These sections aren’t engaging, to me it was the big downside of the entire game. 

Overall a recommended game, you won't regret buying if you are looking for fun, it's a good game, but not 'overwhelmingly' so.",1705284274,1705287542,True,12,2,0.64815986156463623,3,True,False,False

The core combat of the game is a ton of fun; mostly setting up ground combos to go into air combos, using some spider gadgets to web people up, as well as the option for stealth take downs. Once you get the hang of web swinging, it's a total blast to just swing everywhere instead of using the fast travel. Unfortunately that is kind of the extent of my praise for the game.

The main game is very short, I know I have roughly 24 hours at the time of writing this, but most of those hours is from side content and trying to stop every minor side crime in New York. If I only did the main story (not as a speed run attempt) I think I probably could have beaten the main game in like 4-6 hours. It's fine if a game has a lot of side content, just don't expect to see too much development in any of the characters besides Doc Oc's decent to madness.

One of the worst parts of the game is the forced stealth missions as MJ and Miles, they are total jokes for stealth as I usually sprinted right past the guards without them noticing. I understand that it was an attempt to breakup the usual web slinging and beat em up core of the game, but it was more annoying to do than entertaining or enjoyable. 

Perhaps its somehow my fault and I had the graphics set too high, but I ran what Ge force recommended as optimal settings, but I still had quite a lot of screen tearing and stuttering. The game would stutter so badly that the game would crash, usually if I played longer than an hour. I think I had the game crash about 6 times in 24 hours of game play. 

Other bugs I noticed were that sometimes looking through a glass window into a room, I would see through the building to a glitchy outdoors area. I think twice I had enemies somehow get stuck inside a wall alive, which you can't complete some side quests/bases until every enemy in the area is defeated, which is frustrating when it took 5-10 ish minutes to clear an area and then I have to redo it because of this clipping bug.

The game isn't a complete buggy mess though, but it does have more problems than a few other play station ports I've played recently. I do think the game was a ton of fun and would recommend just about anyone who is a fan of marvel or spider man to play it, just perhaps once the game is on sale because I don't like spending $60 on a game that crashes if I play for over an hour.",1705272282,1705272282,True,0,0,0.480769246816635132,0,True,False,False

To begin with, two things: first, I am not hardcore fan, I read few comics there and there when I was a kid, I played the PS1 game, and saw a couple of movies from early 2000's, so keep that in mind. Second, this is not the Spider-Man version of the Batman Arkham games. It doesn't even come close. The Arkham games are in a league of their own, and if you came here expecting something similar. Then you will be disappointed. However, Spider-Man is still a very good entry, with few caveats that break the pacing and the immersion. 
[h2] The Good [/h2]
[b] Gameplay [/b]: Swinging and jumping between buildings is ultra smooth and very fast as it should be. Fighting is responsive and fun with many gadgets and suit modifications to play with. 

[b] Sound[/b]: As you swing, the music intensifies and makes you really feel like you are the Spider-Man, out to get some baddies and save the city that never sleeps. It is really good and well done. Also the voice acting is top notch.

[b] Graphics [/b]: Looks and runs very smooth on 4k on my 6900XT, maintaining a stable 100+ fps with FSR enabled. Also for those who play on TV, HDR works very well.

[b] Misc things I liked [/b] There is tons of references that Marvel fans will definitely enjoy.

[h2] Mixed Feelings [/h2]

[b] Side Quests [/b]: They are fun and varied enough, but they greatly overstay their welcome. I managed to fully upgrade everything and get every suit and I still have A LOT of currency left to spend. I didn't bother to do any of the sidequests in the DLC. 

[b] The Story [/b]: It started good, but somewhere during the middle,I kinda stopped caring about what will happen next as it has gotten very predictable. But the walking parts weren't as bad as people make them out to be, I honestly find them relaxing and a good break from the action.

[b] Boss fights[/b]: Not bad, but could've been done in much much better way. 

[h2] BAD [/h2] 

[b] Mandatory Stealth Sections [/b]:No, I am not talking about being the bad ass Spider-Man webbing your enemies in style, I am talking about you being a weak normal human being. Forced to do stealth sections with no powers. Don't want to spoil anything, but these were horrible, unnecessary, and absolutely the worst part of the game. I wouldn't mind it if it happened once, and I mean only once. But no, it happens occasionally and you just have to force your way through it because otherwise you can't finish the game. 

[b] Self Talk [/b] I get it, I know that Spider-Man is quirky and has tongue in cheek humor and is lighthearted overall. But in this game, they extremely overdo it with the self talk. And I consider myself to have high tolerance for this, but the characters won't shut up ""I have to do this, I need to do that, what will happen then? why is that?"". In a way, it doesn't give you anytime to think about what has been said. Instead, the characters just talk and talk and talk non-stop during the game. So much that you just learn to tune it out. 

[spoiler][b] Miles Morales[/b]: I did feel for him during the story and he was authentic. But later on, specially during the DLC, he just won't shut up. I failed to care for him beyond the initial introduction point where what happened happened. But he is bordering on the level of Adoring Fan kind of annoying [/spoiler]

[spoiler][b] Screwball [/b]: Her sidequests were actually fun and challenging, but she also won't shut up. I am not sure but it seems they were trying to replicate The Joker with her. Bad attempt, and a very horrible character overall. I simply decided to skip her sections entirely. [/spoiler]

[b] Shoehorning the you know what [/b]: Can be easily fixed with mods. 

[h2] Conclusion [/h2] 
The game has incredible gameplay, and it is what saved it from a thumbs down. Swinging between buildings is really fun and they did a great job into making you feel like you are the Spider-Man. Make sure to play the game on Spectacular mode so that you can enjoy the fights and be forced to really use all your Spidey gadgets. On the other hand, don't expect much from the story or character development.

The story was excellent, with a story inherent to Peter Parker that makes the player feel for Peter, his boss, his ex, the villains, and the innocent bystanders that you save along the way. The game play is Arkham Knight level fleshed out, with tight web and gadget mechanics, with a plethora of suits to fit anyone's tastes (Garfield's first suit, anyone? Just me?)

The weakest part of the game, and it's not even that bad, is the graphics and in world collisions. Every once in a while, I'd line up for a point launch or a maneuver through a water tower or fire escape, and the animation would feel slow, or clunky. Closeups to in world assets, such as cars, store signs, traffic cones, etc. are generally low poly, but it's nothing extreme, and doesn't take me out of the story.

Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered sets it apart from most superhero games due to its unique game play and elements that aren't seen from a typical superhero game. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered is a revolutionary game that incorporates all sorts of new game play. The use of Spider-Man's webs are integrated really well with the games combat which makes for some stunning game play. Through the use of webs, players have access to a very unique move set. The player can pull enemies towards them, yank enemies in or out of the air and many, many more. The air combat is also another fantastic addition which is a fun switch of combat. There is also a large selection of gadgets than can be used during combat. Each gadget is fun and unique in its own way. The upgrading system for these gadgets is also cool, allowing them to be improved even further. The gadgets correlate with each other extremely well which can display some awesome combinations. Then there's the traversal, swinging around New York City. This is certainly the best type of traversal in any game so far. It's so fun just swinging around the ginormous map of New York City while being able to see various iconic landmarks while traversing around. The swinging mechanics are just so smooth and it really makes the player feel like Spider-Man. There are also a few air tricks and other techniques that can be performed during swinging. All of this combined makes for some of the best game play out there. Also, the graphics are beautiful and New York City almost looks too real. The customisation is another noteworthy aspect of the game as there are forty suits that can be worn during the adventure. Each suit is unique in its own way and they all have some amazing little details on them. Some suits may look better than other but there isn't any bad suits apart from three or four. The fabrics on the suits look very authentic which are designed with lots of care. Each suit also comes with a unique ability. Each ability is great to use and they all offer fun game play. The campaign is definitely the best part of the game however. It is super long and has some awesome moments. The characters are fleshed out amazingly and have some great interactions with each other. Peter and Mary Jane's relationship particularly stand outs among others. The introduction to the main story is quite fun and it only gets better from there. The boss fights are done perfectly and each new one feels better than the last. The central villain for the first half of the story, Mr Negative is a very fleshed out villain with a very tragic backstory which makes for a compelling villain with sick powers. There are some parts in the story that mix up the game play a tiny bit with a few quick time events which are pretty cool. The DLC is also another great addition which focuses more on the women characters in Spider-Man. It introduces Black Cat which makes for some interesting dynamics between her and Spider-Man. The villain of the DLC, Hammerhead is another welcome addition. The Screwball challenges can also make players very frustrated. Her character in general is just quite terrible and annoying. The real highlight of the game is certainly the build up, relationship and clues with Peter Parker and Doctor Octavius. Throughout the game, Peter and Doctor Octavius's relationship grows stronger and stronger. It is a beautiful relationship. Then around the lab the players can notice several hints. Whether its seeing the plans for the super max prison named the raft, famous villains on the walls to even a new green suit in the lab. It is built up in the greatest way possible and seeing the doctor's transformation into the new antagonist of the game is so tragic but done so beautifully. The build up is certainly worth it and results in the best mission of the game where the sinister six is released and New York turns to turmoil. The cinematic's are stunning. The final act of the game is super fun with lots of boss fights and then there the grand finale. The Doctor Octopus fight. Peter makes probably the best suit in the game for the final boss. The whole game has built up to this final fight, and it is epic, climactic as well as the most emotional in the game. It pulls on your heart strings. Doc Ock makes for a worthy opponent and it is one of the best bosses in gaming today. The ending of this game will surely make you cry and then there is some large setting up which readies the player for the next game. However, there is one massive downside/fault this game has. That is the side missions. There are really only four good side missions that being the Taskmaster challenges which give a nice reward at the end, the Tombstone missions which include a fun boss, the Spider-Men side mission as well as the fun bases around the city. The rest are extremely terrible and drag on for way too long. None change up the game play, most of them are very repetitive. The crimes are the worst part as you need to do over 200 of mostly the same thing. It drags on too long. Though, the rest of the game makes up for this portion of the game. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has defined gaming in all the right ways. Not only is it one of the greatest superhero games, but it is also one of the best games ever. 10/10",1705015663,1705015663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Controlling Spidey is a blast. Web-swinging is just as fun in hour 25 as it is in hour one. Combat is entertaining, but the lack of variety of enemies gets old fast.
I really struggle to recommend this game, though, due to how unnecessarily stretched-out it is. There's just so much padding - I feel like I fought the Demons for like a dozen hours before the real supervillains showed up. I can't tell you how little I care about Mister Negative. 
The real villains show up in the final act, but it was nearly too little, too late.
So much padding: the science puzzles, the MJ/Miles stealth sections that just feel like a K-Mart version of Metal Gear. I just want to play as Spider-Man. That's all.

Just web swinging around the city is fun, even if it does behave in a way that makes absolutely no sense from a physics/momentum point of view. Still, I rarely wanted to fast travel since it was a good time to just manually get from A to B on my own and it was quite entertaining to try and photograph landmark buildings in mid-air without stopping just to see how many I could get in a row without landing in between.

Combat is ok. A bit clunky at times and some of the skills/gadgets I found to be of very limited use. There are enough awful QTEs in some story fights to make it feel like a 2008 game (I'm looking at you, The Force Unleashed) rather than a 2018 game, but at least there's an accessibility option to have the game auto-complete those for you so you don't have to even see them. Would have marked the game down otherwise, so nice spider sense dodge there from the devs.

Most (maybe 90-95%) of the side activities and side missions are decent fun despite the writing often including CSI-level inaccurate tech nonsense that made me roll my eyes, so I would keep cleaning these up whenever I unlocked them. You tend to unlock a new type of side content after every 1-2 main story missions so it keeps the map icons from being overwhelming and gives you a variety of things to do over time. Having a lot of the major side acivities take place at construction sites, in similar looking warehouses or on generic skyscraper rooftops is a bummer, but not too bad when many of the smallest side activites are instead happening at street level. A couple of relatively short missions where you control someone other than Spider-Man and mostly just traverse an area from A to B while dodging patrols were pretty mediocre, with the exception of one MJ mission that had a somewhat neat gameplay twist.

The map screen and the general UI I would consider serviceable but not great. It works, but it's kind of dumb how it only shows bonus objectives for a couple of seconds at the start of a fight and then again for a few seconds whenever you raise the completion counter on some objective. Same with the suit power so you almost never know how long it has left to recharge. Why hide useful info like that constantly by default, especially when the screen is far from being cluttered?

The whole MJ <-> Peter relationship felt like it was written with fairly insecure/immature teenagers in mind rather than experienced pros in their 20s. MJ taking insanely stupid personal risks just to somehow prove that she-can-do-it-alone, just because Peter is concerned about her being reckless while being a normal human in a city full of supercriminals and insane crime gangs felt very weird and possibly just a plot contrivance.
The Spider-Man <-> Captain Yuri working relationship felt way more like something one would actually find between adults and the whole Spider-Cop routine was exactly the kind of silly comedy I would expect from Spider-Man, so props to whoever wrote that and to Yuri's voice actress for an excellent performance.

The main story is generally somewhere in the ok<->good range for the most part (with some cringe writing at times) up until something like 75% completion or 20 hours (that's including all the side content up until that point). 
Sadly, after this point there is a most awkward character ""plot twist"" which feels like it instantly spoils most of the effort you put in up until this point, when really this was when the story should just have wrapped up. Because it's so obvious many hours earlier what is going to happen the very serious and tragic character arc they try to write throughout the game just falls completely flat and it just serves to sour the experience at this point. Had they kept this ""twist"" for the sequel so that you only had fond memories of a character from this game with you into the next game I think it could have worked on an emotional level, but now it just doesn't.

I really hate when videogame writers forcibly spoil your efforts in this way (Bravely Default did something similar) so I saved, quit and uninstalled. If you just stop playing before this bit, though, it's a really solid game.",1704542971,1704544333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, it's value is nullified by:
- Random crashes (loading screens, during missions, when traversing the open world). Disabling DLSS3 or core integrity didn't help to resolve this
- Randomly occurring corruption of save files, one time verifying game files integrity helped, all the others it didn't and I lost progress since the last backup saves

I am writing this review after getting all achievements. It took me about 2 months of on and off playing to finish the first play-through of the story, and then I grinded the New Game+ and DLC content in about 2 weeks.
The game play is amazing. The swinging is so much fun and the way New York looks blew me away. The combat can definetly get a little repetitive, but I tried my best to keep it fresh by focusing on gadget combos in my second playthrough/dlc. The main story was an amazing Spiderman story with some very fun fights and missions throughout. There are a few boring MJ/Miles missions but they aren't very long and you can move through them pretty easily. If anyone is still considering purchasing this game, I would highly recommend it.

I decided to try this game out because I was really into the Arkham Series and I knew that the spiderman games were basically the only other best option aside from the Arkham Series. After loading into the game I am introduced to gorgeous scenery and cinematic themes. This game is a movie, it feels like you are in a movie, the graphics are phenomenal and in direct comparison to the amazing graphics in Arkham knight, both games deliver amazing cinematic cut scenes, an amazing story line, and of course, unforgettable combat.

If you have played or enjoyed any of the Arkham games, or any previous Spiderman games, this game is THE one to get next. You will not be disappointed. Worth the money 100%.",1675643107,1704428820,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Playing as Spider-man genuinely feels like you are Spidey; very acrobatic and agile, you are also strong, but not invulnerable (quite squishy, actually). I like that layer of realism and challenge to it.

The story is not super great, but entertaining enough that I never got bored of it. The plot is predictable, but the writing of the dialogue can be interesting and sometimes funny.

There are a lot of customization options as well, so you can have some freedom on how you want to play.

They break the pacing and are unfun slogs where you have to hope that the patterns are the exact same. I've had missions where the AI pathing just changes for no reason and I get caught because I didn't expect a drone to be somewhere. I really, really love this game when you're playing as Spider-Man, but when I'm playing as anyone else.. It's genuinely a slow, frustrating slog, that has made me want to quit about 4 times in the past 4 hours of gameplay. I want to play as the Spectacular Spider-Man! Not anyone else. I don't want to have to cower and hide when I could be kicking a bad guy in the butt with my Spider powers. The stealth sections as Peter are great, I love picking them off one by one as I get closer to my goals.. But if Spider-Man Miles Morales, and Spider-Man 2 are like this.. I genuinely don't think I want to play this franchise any further. 

I've had other issues, including the way health regeneration works. I play relatively conservatively, and I'm still getting my health zapped to zero in a matter of seconds on the ""normal"" difficulty. It's infuriating to be in a close quarters brawl, and then get zapped to one health, and not have the ability to regenerate any health whatsoever. Call it a ""skill issue"" but when the difficulty is set to specifically be a ""casual experience to enjoy the story"", and I'm getting my ass handed to me every few fights, even when I'm speccing into health regeneration and disarmament.. It is beyond infuriating, and makes me want to throw my controller down and call it.

I'm being really negative, but it's because I want this game to be fun. I've always been a huge Spider-Man fan, I've been one since I was a kid, and until I got to the stealth portions of the game, the difficulty was fine, I was enjoying myself thoroughly, but the random difficulty spikes in fights and the BS stealth sections have really put a damper on my enjoyment of this game. I've intentionally kept myself spoiler free (as much as one can for a 6 year old game, now.), and that includes gameplay mechanics, but if Miles Morales has similar issues.. I will probably refund it pretty quickly.

In all, for ""Marvel's Spider-Man REMASTERED"" I personally give it a Solid 9/10, omitting my major gripes. It really does make you feel like Spider-Man. But... The moment I'm not playing as Spider-Man.. It drops to a 6, 7/10 game.. I do recommend it, for a beat-em-up gamer, or a Spider-Man fan, but the stealth sections are absolutely not for me.",1704319837,1704319837,True,1,1,0.525139689445495605,0,True,False,False

It's really strong in the beginning.. the game cant keep your attention in the lategame very well like in most open world games (def if you play the story and bigger sidequests in one part and you find yourself left with the typical missions you know from this type of games). But the movement and fighting (so many powers in the end, so many combinations and fighting styles possible) is really satisfying and enemies can bring up some heavy attacks so even with your skills and shit you can get into some real trouble, wich means I wasnt bothered that much about those symptoms in the end. Also so for the hardcore fanboys there are plenty of lore, skins and other geeky stuff to unlock.

The optics are outstanding and with some tweeking here and there I can almost run this fluently with my 3060 with ""raytracing"" on and bla so it's kinda optimized, although for streaming this game with nice looks that game was a killer for my system. Whatsoever the world felt really alive and even if you put your settings lower (i tried different settings to fix the stream and it didnt work somehow) like traffic and stuff the streets are still filled and theres happening something everywhere.

For every Spiderman fan this game is a mustbuy if you dont have other newer spider man games. My first one was for the gameboy and later the one on ps1 from activision.. wich was fun but not to compare with this here.. even later spiderman titles felt stiff and clunky in many ways.. this here is butter.

You dont have to be a spideykid to luv the game. Its one of many heroes with its game.. and I guess its compareable in lots of points to other titles.. still never felt so free in a city. Was surprised all the time what kind of creative possibilities had been possible by clever gamedesign. And although this game is mainly full of light and more friendly vibes the story is way darker then you would expect in impulse. 

I recommend checking the specs befor buying.. this game really lives from its optics too. and it's hungry af

The story is.. ok. Nothing to write home about but not shabby either. Poor Otto. I was a bit surprised that by how much of the story is around Norman Osborn but the Green Goblin makes no appearance. I would have wished the other main enemies were a bit more fleshed out. You got Fisk, Mister Negative, Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Electro, Rhino and Scorpion as the main enemies (side appearances of Tombstone, Black Cat and Taskmaster) but only Doc Oc and Mr. Negative get any story, the others are just.. there. As someone with only limited spidey knowledge, a bit more info would have been nice. Hell at first and for a while it looks like Fisk was the main Baddy and besides ""He's a mob boss"" you get nothing.

As far as open world, it's.. not that great. Now, the city is modelled nicely and traversal s good. Swinging around feels great and I'm glad they don't let you swing where there are no buildings, tho I never bothered to check if the swing lines actually attach to anythhing.
But the normal open world ""missions"" are monotone as hell. Infiltrate that Fisk hideout. Ok, I carefully web all the enemies without being detected and.. oh, wave 2, a whole host of new enemies come out and all instantly know where I am? Cool.. So you defeat 6 waves. And every ""hideout"" is the same, as in, location looks different but it's just a several-wave combat area. And later the same again for other main enemies. And again. And again.
Oh there are crimes-in-progress. And it's like a random one of a pool of 5 or so types, most of which are kinda annoying and more time consuming than they should be. and it's 5 per district, of which there are 8 or so. And then there's a new enemy faction and yes, 5 per district again. And then there's a new enemy.. you get the drift.
If they were done in a few seconds, you know, like with collectibles in other open world games, or actually had something different to them I wouldn't have minded. Hell I didn't mind all the riddler trophies in the batman games. But it feels so monotonous here.

Most of the enemies where quite nice to fight, save for the whip guys, screw them.  Batman had the fighting down a bit better, but it works fine most of the time. It was just annoying that when you ziplined away instead of using the evade button, enemies with guns have a perfect aim still - despite both actions are spidey zipping away, just with different buttons. Especially annoying with the snipers, because one shot from them means half the health bar is gone.
I also had it once or twice that enemies just threw a punch and glided 2 meters to me, because I ran away instead of evading. I can't remember something like this happening in Batman.

All in all, the game was good, made fun to play, but let me realize once again how great the batman games were, because it doesn't quite reach that level.

The DLCs are included here and I'm glad they are, if I paid extra for them I'd be upset. They're not good. They introduce a few new enemies that without fail are all annoying to fight. They include a host of ""new"" same old bases, new same old street crimes and new Taskmaster challenges.. Except it's not taskmaster but screwball. A rather new (2008) spidey character that feels quintessentially millenial. She's maximally annoying - intendedly so, but that doesn't make her less annoying. And from what I can find from old threads when this game was a PS4 exclusive, everyone hated her, there were even articles written about how everyone hates her.. Yet she comes back in every DLC. DLC 2 was the worst tho. I love doing things the sneaky way, but her Tasks in DLC 2 with the stealth challenge introduced a ""motion detector"" search light, that's not always easy to see in scanning mode, can only be disabled for a few seconds and all of the challenges hae multiple intersecting motion detectors. Really took the fun out of it.
I was also a bit disappointed becuase from the image of them, I thought they'd let you play as other characters. DLC1 has the title ""The Heist"" and the image of Black Cat. Expectation: Oh you play as the Black Cat, plan a heist, stake the place out, then an extended infiltration mission to steal something, where you have to outsmart spidey at the end or something like that. Or maybe it's the story of the past, the heist that first let her meet spidey (dunno if there was such a heist tho). The Reality: Nope, more of the same, someone else is stealing some USB sticks hidden in pseudorandom places (which don't always make sense story-wise), no heist, no infiltration, just more of the same we already did.",1704239533,1704239721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

3 Best Parts:
1. The Web slinging and movement in this game is GOD tier, I dont think I have ever felt anything more fun in a game in terms of travel. 
2. The voice acting in this game is very well done, all sound emotional and mean what they say. I have to admit I will be saying ""CHASE OF GOOSE?! I HATE CHASE OF GOOSE!"" in my sleep, best line.
3. The number of things added like Costumes, Gadgets,  Tokens, Side missions, Bad guys to fight, side missions (I know I said that, but there are ALOT), the way the city changes with weather, upgrades, ETC Is DISGUSTING in terms of amount to do, (I know my dumb ass did them all) Puts Banjo and Rare games to shame!

3 Worst Parts
1. The way it makes you WAIT and fucking wait and wait and wait between crimes in the city to get crime token and spamming the right thumb stick to find them is annoying. It felt way longer than it needed to be.
2. MJ is insanely annoying and toxic. I get it you are a ""strong person who dont need no man"", but she gets really annoying with her whining through half the game.
3 . The VERY END of the LAST Dlc boss ending was HORRIBLE! I wont spoil it , but dear god you can tell they were in a rush to finish it and wrote themselves into a corner and ran out of time

Again, all of these are more or less personal/ VERY MINOR issues like 9.9/10 game.

Swinging around the city is fast and fun, the fights are engaging, and the story is top notch.  The DLC adds to what is already a great campaign, by tying up some loose ends that are hinted at in the Main Campaign.  My only complaints would be the crimes get repetitive, but with each DLC they added a new type so they didn't get too boring.  A great game that I highly recommend.

I could go on and on why this game is a 9/10 or 9.5/10, but I must talk about some annoying bugs that really make me want to punch my monitor sometimes! 

1. At certain challenges or missions, I like to reload checkpoint, or retry the challenge if I didn't get all 3 medals... This can lead to the game crashing. I re-open the game, reload the save and it will crash again. Sometimes it won't crash and then I gotta hope I can do this challenge without failing, because 99% of the time if this bug is active, the game will just crash again. Really annoying.

2. Trying to do these challenges, like the combat ones can be really annoying because the finisher move DOESN'T WANT TO WORK!!! I'm spamming Y+B to get the finisher and Spidey is just cartwheeling around getting hit, losing my combo and points. Then I reload checkpoint and you guessed it... the game crashes again.

But the real trick for me is that I do not have to be 'bribed' by the game at all to want to play it and interact with its open world. Find a bunch of backpacks? That's awesome I get to swing around and be Spider-Man. Catch some Pigeons? That's awesome I get to swing around and be Spider-Man. Stop a Car Chase? That's awesome I get to swing around and be Spider-Man. 

I never feel like I'm being forced to do busy work to achieve some other end, like so many other open-world games, since I just love playing as Spider-Man so much. All the open world tropes and quests just give a purpose and direction, but its the game that is fun, the immersive feeling of being Spider-Man that is fun, not the mechanical joy of completing a to do list.

EDIT: After playing the DLC, it seems like a bunch of open world / video game tropes snuck in, escort quests, base defense, etc and especially the variety of enemies that took very specific tactics to take down. And while its at least ""interesting"" to say, ""Well, I've got to take care of the snipers, then the rocket guys, all while avoiding shield charges, and trying to get hits in on the invincible fat men while I can..."" it really cuts into the power fantasy of BEING Spider-Man. I preferred the gameplay of ""how am I going to style on these guys"" more than, ""If I miss a dodge on a rocket, I'm probably boned."" While I feel like I'm now much better at the game, you do have to raise your game to finish the DLC, it feels like I'm a better video game player, rather than a better Spider-Man. It seems like all the B-/C+ ideas that didn't get put into the main game found second life to pad out the extra content. Its still an excellent game though, and I'm happily going to play Spider-Man Miles Morales, which the DLC nicely bridges too.",1699344179,1704006810,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat is the same all the time, very minor upgrades that don't really change the core of the combat, which is the center of the game.
This is just like any batman game, except here the atmosphere is not as good, the side missions and puzzles are not that interesting, and its much more expensive. 

If you have not tried Batman Arkham City and similar games, go play those instead. If you dislike batman / love spiderman or the game is too old for you, this game works as a way to experience the combat mechanics.

I wanted this game since it came out on PS4, but I didn't have a Playstation or capable computer back then. 5 years later, I got a souped up computer and now I can experience this masterpiece. It's... the most realistic game I've played so far, with everything at ultra high and ray tracing with 90 fps. Just buy this game. PLEASE!",1703915252,1703915252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Incredibly disappointing, that's what this game is. Sure, the movement is fun for the runtime of the game but that's about it. Combat is nothing special, most missions aren't that fun and the story is... boring and underdeveloped. They stuffed far too many villains into the game. The sinister six deserved way more than just a few fights. Non of them (except for the final boss) even get to stand in the spotlight. Then there is mister negative who is so boring and uninteresting that the game would have benefited from cutting him out and instead using the run time to more deeply explore the sinister six. On top of that is the standard, formulaic checklist side content.

Feels just like Spiderman, the character movement is so fluent and satisfying, 
It feels like an honest attempt at making a great spiderman game with no compromises and a lot of passion from the developers, effort and genuine love for the franchise.

Combat is nice and there's enough variety to almost keep the combat from getting old (it still gets boring by the end).
New Yorks' rendition is simply breathtaking, the missions can get repetitive which is a repeating trend in current triple A gaming and there's some 'stealth' missions where you use other characters (without powers) that are ok in the beginning but get really old, boring and annoying after the first half of the game.

The story is not a masterpiece by any means, the plot is what it is with some charaters that act odd for no reason and some events that feel forced to include more characters (which might be a welcome addition for the fans that want to see the most characters possible). The same with the action scenes, they're flashy and over the top but sometimes the actions ruin the immersion since they encompass odd decisions by the characters.

Overall I have to recommend this game, it's like you can't go wrong with any current PlayStation PC port.
Even if you don't particularly like spiderman as a franchise, this game is really worth picking as one of the current best action adventure games for PC.",1703888725,1703888725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I think this game is a 9 out of 10 at the moment. It is comparable, but distinctly different from the Batman Arkham games. Only issue I have is that my controller, the Switch Pro, doesn't work all the way correctly. I can either have it work aside from moderate to severe joystick drift if I use Steam configuration or a mildly inconvenient button remapping and VERY bad movement and camera issues if i use the in game preset only.

This is one of the best games I've played in my life. I haven't had such a sense of wonder swinging around Manhattan for a long time. The movement is absolutely on point and it feels just like being in the shoes of Spider-Man.

Becoming Spiderman and being able to, simply put, wallop anyone who did anything remotely villainous was a rush and a half.

I have no issues with the Miles Morales port, just this one. 
If there are any other reviews that talk about this issue, please consider saving your money and getting the game on it's original console, or a different one. If you don't, just assume that it's a me issue and move on.

Edit: This is a dull game. Its combat is repetitive and basic, and yes, you may be thinking, ""Basic, but you have so much motion in combat!"" And while yes, that's true, the actual combat itself is crap; it has similar animations and the same fights, just in a different location. In my opinion, this game is not worth $100 AUD, although the story is passable and the swinging is fantastic.

Pros

Story: Among the myriad Spider-Man tales, this game stands out as the best narrative rendition of the iconic superhero. Yuri Lowenthal brings Peter Parker to life with an amicable charm, infusing the character with dorky humor and a genuine love for his close ones. The development of the main villain, particularly the complex relationship between Doc Oc and Peter, adds emotional depth. Heartwarming connections with secondary characters enhance the storytelling. The action scenes, masterfully filmed, are not just exhilarating but can also leave you breathless.

Gameplay: The game successfully captures the essence of being Spider-Man. Swinging through the city feels rewarding and is so satisfying that fast travel becomes an afterthought. The velocity and wind while swinging contribute to the authentic Spider-Man experience. Combat, especially in the highest difficulty, demands effective use of gadgets, creating a superhero feel. Achieving big combos, executing perfect dodges, and sending enemies flying make you not just a superhero but specifically Spider-Man.

Would-building: New York City feels alive and authentic, bustling with life on its streets. The level of detail, whether swinging across rooftops or exploring the streets on foot, is remarkable. Interiors, despite mixed feelings about MJ and Miles stealth missions, showcase intricate design, encouraging players to slow down and appreciate the details.

Music: John Paesano's musical composition elevates the game to superheroic heights. The score is on par with the Avengers, reflecting inspiration from the iconic team. The music effectively enhances the sense of Spider-Man being a genuine superhero, balancing heroism with humility.

Cons

Open World: While the open-world design impresses with its attention to detail, the accompanying mechanics introduce a drawback. Secondary missions, such as bases and city crimes, become overly repetitive. Even with slight variations for different factions, the core gameplay remains unchanged. The monotony can make these missions feel like a tedious chore, especially when striving for 100% completion. The fighting mechanics help alleviate this to some extent, but the repetitiveness becomes a noticeable flaw.

Summary: ""Marvel’s Spider-Man"" emerges as a stellar action game, seamlessly blending a compelling narrative with a meticulously crafted Spider-Man experience. The game excels in presenting a superb main character, a gripping story, and unparalleled mobility. For me, it stands as the epitome of the Spider-Man gaming experience.",1703447788,1703653315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That being said, there were a couple negatives. throughout my play-though, the game did save in a state where a had to revert back to an old save, losing a little bit of progress, in order to launch the game successfully. that being said however, my pc specs aren't the best so it very well could have been a me problem. overall though, as long as you make manual saves often and can power through a couple crashes, this game is a must play for any spider man fan and i would definitely recommend it even if you have never met Peter Parker

This reimagined version of the original Spider-Man for the PlayStation 4 brings not only a visual facelift but also subtle enhancements that elevate the overall experience, making it a must-play for both fans of the original and newcomers alike.

The first and most noticeable improvement in Spider-Man Remastered lies in its visuals. The game has undergone a stunning makeover, with enhanced graphics that take full advantage of the PlayStation 5's capabilities. The cityscape of New York has never looked more vibrant and alive, with detailed textures, improved lighting effects, and a level of realism that immerses players in the bustling metropolis like never before. The character models, especially Spider-Man's suit, showcase a level of detail that is a testament to the power of next-gen hardware.

The performance boost is equally impressive. Spider-Man Remastered runs at a smooth 60 frames per second, providing a buttery-smooth web-swinging experience that enhances the fluidity and responsiveness of the controls. The fast-paced action sequences, acrobatic combat, and seamless transitions between exploration and combat benefit greatly from the improved frame rate, making every swing and punch feel more dynamic and satisfying.

The addition of ray tracing is another standout feature, bringing an extra layer of realism to the reflective surfaces of the city and the glossy sheen of Spider-Man's suit. The ray-traced reflections contribute to the overall visual fidelity, creating a more immersive and visually stunning rendition of New York City.

Beyond the technical upgrades, Spider-Man Remastered includes a thoughtful assortment of additional content. The three new suits, each with unique abilities, provide a fresh take on Spidey's wardrobe and add a layer of excitement for players familiar with the original game. The inclusion of the photo mode allows players to capture and share their favorite in-game moments, showcasing the game's breathtaking visuals in a more personal way.

Despite these enhancements, Spider-Man Remastered remains true to the essence of the original game. The engaging narrative, well-developed characters, and the thrill of swinging through the iconic New York City skyline are preserved, ensuring that the heart and soul of the original experience are not lost in the remaster.

In conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered successfully combines the nostalgia of the original with the cutting-edge capabilities of the PlayStation 5. It's not just a visual upgrade; it's a celebration of the timeless appeal of Spider-Man as a gaming icon. Whether you're revisiting the adventures of Peter Parker or swinging into the Spider-Verse for the first time, Spider-Man Remastered is a spectacular journey that showcases the best of what the web-slinger has to offer in the next generation of gaming.",1703458135,1703458135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story itself is fairly predictable (or perhaps I just remember watching a streamer play through it), but that's expected with MARVEL. Playing on second highest difficulty isn't necessarily challenging but it also doesn't feel like someone's holding my hand through it all. The graphics on OLED steam deck look stunning, and every consecutive time I shoot web it's just as satisfying as the last. Everything about this game feels great.

Web slinging feels amazing, story is very good, fighting is good as well. The fighting does feel a little repetitive after awhile but as long as you mix up your attacks and wheel of spidey gadgets it'll keep it feeling alive for much longer. The side missions feel rewarding, like you're actually helping everyday citizens instead of stopping the city from literally being leveled. 

Miles/MJ Gameplay: Ok yeah its not as fun as being Spiderman, that's a given. However you do feel much more powerless because you've been relying on being able to beat people up with the might of Zeus. It is decently linear (some sections you have an open area but it all goes to the same place), and when MJ and Spiderman team up and you're directing Spiderman take downs. It feels very satisfying to do.

Overall: 9/10. Minus 1 for  repetitive feel of combat after a decent chunk of time (but it is still satisfying).",1700455569,1703384176,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I loved playing this game. That said, there are a few things that really drag it down.

The biggest one for me was the inconsistent writing. I will say that I do think they managed to write a good plot. Though it wasn't anything revolutionary, it definitely had its moments and I did enjoy it overall. However, there were multiple times where they undermine story's credibility for no absolutely reason. Without any spoilers, one example of this is SM's Spidey-Sense selectively not working, either to allow a side-character to save him, or to showcase a new antagonist. Often times it came off as an attempt to promote a strong female character, however it achieved the opposite effect due to it seeming forced. Strangely enough, there was one female character who was absolutely amazing, so they clearly know how to do it. Which makes it even more baffling that the female lead was so bland and needed blatant plot armor to be even slightly useful.
Another example of the story really dropping in quality is also due to the aforementioned female lead. She plays a large part in the story, and out of all the scenes she appears in there are maybe two or three in which she isn't whining about something or other. The incessant complaining really starts to get annoying and there is no way to make it stop since you HAVE to listen to the phone calls.
It's a real shame that there were so many great characters here, but one of the most important ones was just so insufferable.

When it comes to the combat mechanics, they knocked it out of the park. They did an incredible job of making Spiderman feel powerful. His many different abilities you can use in combination with each other allow for many different play-styles and strategies. The web-swinging aspect also felt spectacular. Traversing the map never got boring, to the point where I never even used the fast travel.
The thing is, they put so much effort into Spidey himself that I think they lost focus on the rest of the game. Regarding the enemies, there are essentially only five variations with different costumes on depending on who the main antagonist is at that point in the story. The combat ended up feeling a bit boring by the end of it, just because of how repetitive the enemies were. I also am of the opinion that aside from the street thugs, there shouldn't be any enemies walking around without weapons, since it just doesn't make sense, and even they should at least have pocket knives. All in all I think they could have done a better job. I will say however that this doesn't extend to the boss fights, all of which were unique and challenging.
The open world is in a similar situation. It appears great initially, with great visuals and many collectibles and side-quests, but as you play you realize how empty it is. Once you have completed all the side-quests and secondary objectives, there is literally nothing to do in this game aside from stopping the same three or four crimes over and over. On top of that, most of these secondary objectives aren't even fun to begin with. Most of them consist of collecting the same object x amount of times, and don't even get me started on the Screwball missions. To say they are infuriating is an understatement, and one of the later ones is literally impossible to do properly if you purchased a certain upgrade, which you definitely will have done by then as it's near the end of the last DLC. I think they could have put in more of an effort to make the world feel alive.

Overall this is a great game, however I think it's slightly too expensive for the price, since the most you're going to get out of it is around 50 hours of gameplay, and that's if you complete all the side missions too. Despite its flaws I did really enjoy this game though, and I definitely recommend it.",1690143833,1703351443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The swinging is by far the best thing out of this entire package. While I don't think the swinging is AS free flowing as Spider-man 2 on the GameCube, it has some nice flow to it and requires a lot of finesse to get down so I'm very much satisfied with it. Everything else though...not so much.

The combat is...fine I guess. It feels more comparable to a watered-down hack and slash if anything else. You get a very small handful of moves to start out with (exactly one grounded combo, a launcher, and an air combo) and a few more smaller techniques added on later. It ""works"" yeah, but there's just not a whole lot of variety, and the game essentially brow beats you into air combo-ing everything in sight over and over again because that's the best way to clear rooms in an effective way. It deals more damage, it charges focus faster, it makes a vast majority of enemies helpless, and it just gets stale after a while. The bosses aren't anything to write home about and the enemy variety is sorely lacking. The gadgets aren't well implemented in combat either and a lot of them just feel like they're there for the sake of being there. There's only so much joy I can mine from cannonball kicking the same faceless goon for the umpteenth time before I lose interest and go back to swinging around the city.

The stealth sections don't get any praise however, they SUUUUCK. These try and ape off the Arkham predator sections without understanding what made these sections work to begin with: enemy AI, level design, and tension. All of which Marvel's Insomniac's Disney's Stan Lee's Spider-Man spectacularly fails at. There's no thought or strategy behind any of these sections, they feel so forced and tacked on and utterly dull, and what makes it worse is that after you clear the room by stealth takedown-ing everyone the game just spawns enemies in already alerted to your presence anyway so like...what exactly was the point in using stealth to begin with? The MJ and Miles sections bring the pace of the game to a screeching halt. They aren't fun or interesting, they're the generic ""sneak behind bushes and throw distraction items to avoid being instakilled"" stealth gameplay that's already been done to death (and done better) in a variety of other games. 

The open world isn't even fun to explore either. It's filled to the brim with the typical open world busywork schlock; copy pasted enemy base assaults, radio towers, collectibles spewed everywhere. Even when I have this desire to pick the game back up again I'm reminded that outside of the swinging, there's nothing here for me to really enjoy.

The nicest things I can say about it is that it looks really nice and it's competently put together. That's really about it. I would hope the sequels do a much better job at innovating and improving what didn't work prior but judging from gameplay footage, not really. Quite a shame

Is not a long game; If you focus only on main missions and skip cinematics, the game is 4 or 5 hours long, which is a bit dissapointing. I hated all the parts where you have to use MJ or Miles. They felt stupid and unnecesary. Also they break the pacing of the game, quite a lot. Sadly, for what I heard, it is a trait that perdured in the following titles. Lastly, both in the DLC and NG+, the times between main missions where you have ""dead time"" for patrolling the city until the next mission triggers, felt like stupid move. They could have chained all side missions without down time in between and it would have been the same.

The side missions and map objecitves, some are ok and some aren't. The ""crimes"" felt like a chore and weren't engaing enough to keep me interested in them. Same happened with the side missions of the missing students from ESU. In contrast, Taskmaster tasks, the landmarks and even catching the pidgeons are more entertaining and fun.

About the story, it is a nice one, with a very complete gallery of rogues. Somehow, this is the second (or third?) time that I hate MJ's character in a Spider-Man portrayal. They make her so unlikeable that it even feels weird that Peter still goes after her. I saw more connection with Felicia in the DLC. About those, Ep1 and 3 were ok-ish enough, Ep2 was a snooze fest. Besides that, having completing 100% of the main story before going to the DLC makes the side objectives of it a complete waste of time, since you are already full upgraded in every aspect. They could have added a few things in here, to keep it interesting (or some sort of unlockable action), but no, you esentially slugh through the DLC and NG+ without anything ""new"" besides some suits. About the suits, it's a nice thing to have, also the combinable powers; but not all have the same quality, imo.

The achievements weren't hard to get, pretty straight forward. While doing the second run for the NG+, I didn't get why some cinematics are skippable and some not; my guess is for it to be a bit longer that it actually is. 

Anyway, I liked a few things, and I hated a lot more, so my opinion may be controversial, but is barely a 5. Having played games like the Arkham series (which this game is heavily inspired of), this one falls short.",1703036820,1703036882,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Хотя полет на паутине в той игре был супер примитивным (там висели такие паутинки между зданиями и только за них можно было цепляться), мне безумно нравилось летать по Нью-Йорку и проходить неимоверно сложные, как мне тогда казалось, миссии. Игра делала невозможное возможным давая возможность прикинуть на себя роль дружелюбного соседа и надрать задницу Доктору Октавиусу. Это было своего рода магией для тогдашнего меня. Кто бы мог подумать, что спустя 20 лет, эта магия никуда не исчезнет и я снова смогу ощутить себя Человеком-пауком в похожей игре, но уже с более интересным сюжетом, постановкой и по-настоящему живыми персонажами. Питер тут прям как надо - обаятельный и остроумный добряк, который готов пожертвовать самым дорогим ради спасения людей. По игре видно, что люди, которые её создавали, очень любят этого персонажа и дорожат им. Не часто можно увидеть такое бережное отношение к популярным героям и их фанатам. Очень порадовало наличие разных костюмов, в особенности тех, что из фильмов. Так приятно иногда надеть костюм из трилогии с Тоби и, летая по Нью-Йорку, понастальгировать по детству.

I don't count Origins). It looks spectacular, better than even some CURRENT games, Rocksteady has mastered the glorious combat mechanics with some new welcome editions. While yes, the Bat-mobile v tanks was a little excessive, I didn't mind too much because it was still fun to drive around in the badass ride. While the bossfights weren't as great as City's, they were still fun and amazing, Pyg, Man-bat, Riddler, Penguin, and the 3 jokers were standouts in my opinion. Speaking of the bosses, the designs for them are better than ever. Scarecrow is legitimately terrifying at certain times, and his voice actor did an absolutely amazing job. Pyg looks horrifying, and the way he speaks is just disturbing and really sells that he thinks he's doing people a favor. Man-bat looks like he should, a realistic blend of man and bat, his lifeless looking eyes, and teeth, the way he screeches making it sound like he's in pain and doesn't know where to go is just heartbreaking. The rest look great too, Deathstroke, Firefly, Two-Face, Joker, Azrael, all don't have too significant changes, but still look spectacular. There is one character I haven't mentioned yet, the Arkham Knight. While I knew who he was as soon as he said he had a history with Batman, and just his attitude overall, I knew who he was. But even then, it was still sad to see. It wasn't surprising who he was, but how he felt and his motivation was indeed surprising. You believe him, you feel his side of the story. I don't wanna spoil for people who haven't played, so that's all I'm gonna say. 
The heroes along side Batman are also super cool, Nightwing's design is super badass, and the metallic blue emblem that goes around his chest and back is really cool. While Robin isn't SUPER prominent, he still looks awesome, with the shaved head, the brighter suit since City, and trading the dark green gloves and boots for black looks way better. Oracle, Alfred, Jim Gordon, Cash, Lucius Fox, they all look great, if not too different (well, except Lucius, who made his first appearance in the game). Batman REALLY shines though, the first suit you start with looks great, and then you get upgraded to the ULTIMATE BAT-SUIT. It looks SO GOOD, and they explain why it makes sense, science! YEAH! The suit's features really make you feel like you're the Dark Knight himself, I won't spoil anything, but it really is a feast for the eyes. 

Overall, the game, while flawed, is a superb game, and an even better Batman game. Maybe not the best in Arkham series, but definitely the one I play the most, and the one I will without a doubt, call my favorite.

The story it tells is great, but there is a huge over-reliance on Quick Time Events during segments that would otherwise be fun. And most every story event has scripted requirements of how things go down, which makes playing your way feel kinda pointless. You spend so much time stealthily picking off enemies during base missions, only for the wave battles to trigger no matter what you do. And the late-game/post-game enemies can counter most of your moves, so creatively taking down hordes of enemies becomes less possible/satisfying as the game goes on.

A large arsenal of cool gadgets and a extensive skill tree for your favorite web head. The story here is actually really good for a video game and the boss fights were fun and emotionally engaging. The web swinging is unbelievably good and one of the best parts of the game. Lots of side content after the main story. The skins and upgrades/mods are really fun to unlock and play with. 

2. The Bad: The basic enemies can get a little repetitive. While there is a lot of side quests, some of it is repetitive, boring, and tedious (I'd say the large majority is). The enemy AI isn't very good or in depth at all but it's still fun regardless. Overall definitely worth getting even at a higher price.

3. The DLC: Some of the content is good and some of it boring. I found the stories to be very meh. I enjoyed the Black Cat story line a good amount. Hammerhead was a interesting character in the first DLC pack and a great boss fight, but they definitely dragged him along into the other packs and he got old fast. Silver Sable was kind of meh and a lot of the game play is identical to the first game and isn't introducing anything new. These DLCs add a lot of side content but it's all pretty standard repetitive, boring side missions with little to no story connection.

Fighting bad guys is also good. Spidey's got moves, and the combat feels smooth but it can get repetitive. The story is on point – it's got that superhero drama and action and everything comes together amazingly, even when you add up the DLCs. Voice acting ain't too shabby either.

And hey, talking about DLCs, they bundled in all the extra content, so that's a win. No need to nickel and dime for DLC.

Overall, if you're into Spider-Man or just want a solid action game, this one's worth a go. It's not reinventing the wheel, but it spins it damn well. Go swing around and have some fun. That is granted.

The story is brought down by the infamous MJ missions, which honestly you can blitz through in mere minutes if you abuse the AI's poor observation skills.

Marvels Spider-man is a exceptional game with a great story, fun combat& gadgets, interesting side stories and 3 great DLC's. I had so much fun just swinging through
the city and occasionally throwing a web bomb in a jewelers shop pasting the walls in web and all the thugs that were unsuccessfully trying to rob it. The game feels alive, there is always something to catch your eye and there is always something to do. If anything, you will not be bored.
I had 3 crashes in my 48hrs played, not many, but at the same time I was expecting zero. There was also frame drops every now and then which would cause me to have to reboot the game. I also saw people 20ft above the air at one point but I just said meh and moved on.

Achievements: Mostly collectibles and side objectives that you can do when you want a break from the main story. If your going for 100% completion you will get everything in time nor can you miss anything so relax and just play the game with your leisure. The same applies to the DLC.

9.5/10 The crashes and performance hurt it slightly, but Spider-man is still a fantastic game. Can't wait for No.2 to be ported just so that I can hear more of Jonah Jamesons egging, grumpy old fart.

[b] Story - 7.5/10 [/b]
Main story: a web of fun and engagement. DLCs, though, lack the same thrill, feeling a bit lackluster in comparison

[b] Graphics and Sound - 8.5/10 [/b]
The detail of Manhattan is pretty amazing, lighting looks stunning and the raytracing reflections are noticable and run surprisingly well even on AMD GPUs.
The music and sound effects are pretty decent too.

[b] Gameplay and Mechanics - 9.5/10 [/b]
The webswinging is really smooth and the mechanics are overall pretty good.

[b] Playtime - 9/10 [/b]
Just the main story should take approximately 10h, 100% completion including all DLCs takes about 45h-60h.

[b] Difficulty - 7.5/10 [/b]
The main game is pretty easy, even on the highest difficulty. The second and third DLC are way harder but still doable.
Overall an easy to average game in terms of diffculty.

[b] Achievements 10/10 [/b]
Very doable, not too boring, too hard or grindy.
As is said, 45h-60h for 100% completion.

CONS:
saves often corrupt, luckily the game backs up old saves up to 10 (though it still seems to crash anyway). i found to get all the saves working correctly (including the most recent non-back up save) copy and paste all your saves to another location/folder, delete everything in the games saves folder location, boot the game, get into gameplay from a new game, then exit the game entirely and copy your saves back to the games save location folder and overwrite anything that's currently in there. idk why this works but it's saved my progress about 5 or 6 times.

game freezes sometimes and you have to ALT + F4 to exit it. luckily this doesn't happen too often.

I think I came into this game expecting too much because it is an extremely hyped up game. The story is great, but it is too long. As well as some of the boss fights. I hated having to wait to move onto the next story mission as well.

Gonna not recommend this one based on the fact that I had to disable SMT in my bios in order to get consistent fps. With hyperthreading disabled I was getting 70-90fps swinging around the city. Before that fix it would literally drop to <30fps. Not acceptable. If they fix this (and I somehow hear about them fixing it) I'll update my review to positive.

Game: 9/10

A shockingly heartfelt and emotional story with absolutely transcendent movement mechanics. This is probably the closest thing we will get to a Gravity Rush 3. The presentation when things get trippy are fantastic and the ending has some of the most emotional acting I've seen in a videogame. Loved it way more than I was anticipating given this is a super hero game.

Why not a 5 star imo:
my only real complaint is that literally 20 seconds after one crime gets solved, another one is already popping up. Like, I get that in the third act it should feel like chaos and like the city is falling apart, but going from one copied event to another so quickly just feels crowded and not necessarily deep.

Also I didn't love the MJ/Miles stealth sections. I don't mind playing as other characters with different mechanics, and I get that they were probably trying to remind players that Spiderman is a super hero by making you play as a normal human in a world lead by super villains, but they still felt kinda clunky and padded compared to how polished everything spiderman was.

Definitely worth picking up on a good sale. Worth $30-40 USD I'd say",1702283941,1702285092,False,0,0,0.470781296491622925,0,True,False,False

Combat is fine. It's very easy until the late game when they just start introducing various enemies who are just immune to your attacks. The bossfights, while somewhat cinematic, are laughably easy.

Story doesn't matter, it's Spiderman. I wanted to skip through every cutscene and, in retrospect, wish I did.

The expansion/addon/DLC/whatever are just really boring and I couldn't be bothered to play through all of them.

I wish there was a % score for these ratings. Thumbs up or down option just isn’t accurate enough. This game is like a ¾ thumb. When it’s in full swing it’s AMAZING! But then it's lows are totally cringe. When you’re zipping around fighting crime and solving stuff as spiderman the game is at it highest points! But when you must play the stupid side plots quests as MJ or when you even must talk to her it’s so bad. Make an MJ game and give people the option to play that if you think it needs to be done. But to strong arm her into this game felt forced for DEI score. Her dialog is eye rolling and I just wanted her to stop talking every time she was around, all she does is gaslight peter for being a hero and not putting her needs first. IDK who wrote her but get a clue people. Miles is not far off from this, he’s very whiny, and he's hard to relate to IMO but IDk maybe I'm just to old heh. Some of the highlights where aunt May who was very well written, she’s warm, kind and relatable. She feels like an actual person. I couldn’t help smiling whenever she was in a scene. Doc OC was another stand out too, you definitely get a feel for what he’s going through, very fleshed out. 

The combat is executing, even if it is just a one button mash. I liked it. It was hard on hard but not so hard that I wasn’t able to take in all the cool things going on around me while I was in the middle of it. The game play loop is good, towards the end of it I was starting to get a bit bogged down in doing the same kinda bases and chases repeatedly. The side content was definitely over kill in this area, some of these side missions are very bad.... I chased some pigeons? For a maybe homeless guy or something? idk very weird. I wanted to play the DLC for the story but they felt very bloated and bogged down with the same mechanics of main game but with out any of the substance of it. I think they problly released this way later originally? So maybe people would like getting back into the swing of things like this but as a full playthrough I would not recommend doing the dlc stuff. Just go watch some videos of the cut scenes.

Anyways there it is, IDK if it’s a hawt take or not just my thought. Good game not great.",1702175950,1702176602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Web-slinging feels great with a satisfying sense of momentum and speed, combat is fun and easy to understand and satisfying to throw enemies around. Story isn't sophisticated top-tier kino but it is interesting and fun to follow. There are also a lot of fun costumes to unlock from a plethora of other Spider-Man media and collectibles that give you little lore tidbits (and more costumes!). Most costumes even come with abilities that let you do wacky stuff during combat that either make the game easier, difficult, or silly (and can be used on any costume!) Gadgets are fun but some are way-too over-powered (will talk about that a bit later.). This game is also really fun to get all achievements in (hint: The statue of liberty is a photo location and isn't very obvious, do that first when you get to it.). Also the DLC missions though relatively brief, are really fun and have some cool stuff to unlock

Now for cons and nitpicks:

This game crashed for me a LOT while fast-traveling on Windows. There have been some other crashes during random events but most are due to fast-travel. Thankfully it's pretty fun to just swing places instead but it is still a very annoying bug that has existed far too long. Also there are some stealth sections in the game where you play as MJ or Miles Morales (before the cool Spider powers) and it really disrupts the flow of the game. The segments aren't horrendous but get very annoying on subsequent playthroughs.

About performance, this game should be playable on just about anything from the past 10 years that isn't a Chromebook, you just may need to use FSR for a playable framerate on older GPUs. I had issues maintaining 60fps at native resolution no upscaling on my GTX 1660ti but I think I really abused that poor thing in the past. Game runs well on Steam Deck too with fair performance and visuals. Just enable FSR with a fps target of 30. More info is on ProtonDB. There is a weird graphical bug on Steam Deck (maybe Linux/amd cards in general?) where moving the camera will smear certain objects, I do not know what causes this as I've tried every setting. If you have a decent GPU though, this game is BEAUTIFUL. Even without raytracing (do not use unless you are made of money for your own sanity, the game looks great without it)

TL:DR, great game that's hours of fun with some technical issues that aren't game ruining and tedious segments that are annoying when replaying the game

I recommend this game even at full price

After the first 7 hours of uninterrupted fun, I was already thinking about complaining only a little bit but still giving it a thumbs-up, however, despite not changing the previous settings, I've been getting one crash to desktop after another every 30 to 60 minutes for several sessions. Curiously, after progressing into the story a bit, and not changing anything in the settings, the issue disappeared...

As for the game itself:

Pros:
- The story is okay. Nothing groundbreaking, good old Spider-man
- The environment looks amazing
- A lot of settings to choose from
- Can turn off QTEs
- A lot of mentions of the ""older"" material and events
- Web-slinging through the city is masterfully done. Full trajectory control via mouse movements, the feeling of building speed. (But...)
- Most side missions and exploration activities and goals are fun, often accompanied with an interesting commentary from MC

Cons:
- Combat feels clunky and not properly optimized - MC is limited by certain animations, resulting in some moves not working like you would expect
- The character feels far too squishy (I know he's no Hulk, nor Iron-man, but still...)
- the stealth segments (of side characters) are pointless
- The ranked challenge missions are terrible. I don't mind trying to improve my high-score, but here it's about combating the clunky controls and trying to guess how the character will move on his own during parkour
- few moments where the terrain textures obstructed my field of vision during combat
- after playing through most of the main story, I can't shake the feeling that despite the details, the characters are often quite... soulless, empty and stiff

Other than the above, I can't shake the feeling it's a strange mix of Batman games and Prototype 2 with just a texture of Spider-man, but with its own dose of unoptimized faults.",1701107736,1702155571,False,5,0,0.53225940465927124,0,True,False,False

I really loved this game at first. I have over 40 hrs of gameplay so no chance for a refund. But then the bugs started to get more frequent. At first I could just reload and get the game running like normal. But then it started crashing completely with every loading screen and every fast travel. And trying to restart the game takes 3-5 tries before the game actually runs. It's impossible to get immersion when I get kicked out for 20-30 minutes every time I need to reload. 

I waited a week before writing this review because I made a support ticket. The forum is full of people with the same problem. I was hoping someone would respond and fix the problems but it is apparent that they don't care.

It crashes when you use quick travel. That, in itself, would not be terrible. It also seems to save a corrupted version of your game, and when you try to load it, it crashes. That's the auto save. And, inevitably, it's the manual save as well. 

I thought I'd solved the problem, but no, it crashes, the saved game doesn't work, and I'm more than 75% done the game. A quick search online reveals that MANY people are having this same problem. It is beyond frustrating to get that far into a game, lose your saved games, and either have to start over again, or give up. I chose to give up.

Until that is fixed, don't buy the game. It's fun, you would enjoy it, but it will slowly drive you insane. It cannot be finished in its current state, unless you manually save every time you accomplish anything, for fear of losing what you've accomplished.

Bizarrely, I had none of these issues with the Spider-Man: Miles Morales game, which is a sequel to this one. Not sure why. It worked fine and I really enjoyed it.",1701869765,1701869765,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

[b][u]RUNS PHENOMENALLY ON STEAM DECK AT 30+ FPS[/u][/b]
[i](There was an issue late in the second act where dialogue audio wouldn't play properly, but it didn't last more than a few minutes- easy to overlook and probably just a quirk of the Deck)[/i]

I purchased this game at a 33% discount, and I feel like I had a 5-Star meal, alongside a delicious after-course.

I've very stubborn when it comes to my decisions about which games to play, let-alone [b]continue[/b] playing after the initial boot. I know next to nothing about Marvel but this game had me absolutely hooked, on the edge of my seat to see what comes next. The emotional highs, lows, the writing, the interactions- the world, it's all so real and convincing. This game made me feel like a real superhero.

It's so refreshing for me to play a game that truly feels like it cut no corners. There's no missing context. No bossfights that end before they start. No glaring technical issues. No loose ends. The world is massive and yet I cannot recall encountering a single glitch- it's unbelievable how much love, care and time went in to polishing this game.

It took me 14 hours to reach the credits, and I am beyond satisfied with what I spent / what I received in return. I haven't even touched the DLCs yet.

If you're a Marvel fan, this is a must-play.
If you're [i]not[/i] a Marvel fan, but you like great movement, combat, and exciting story full of many twists and turns, then I urge you to try Spider-Man Remastered",1701587448,1701595260,True,29,2,0.704150974750518799,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1. Amazing Graphics
2. Smooth Combat
3. Traversal options are good
4. Web-Swinging is safe but good enough to keep you enjoying it throughout the game
5. Story is decent with powerful emotional scenes
6. Good customisation options, you can make different builds with the suit mods and suit powers. 
7. Many alternative costumes

Cons:
1. The Combat gets quite repetitive, and while there are ways to make it more interesting, it is ultimately not enough to make you enjoy the combat fully throughout the entire game.
2. In certain story segments you are forced to play as other characters, and the Mary Jane segments are notoriously boring to get through. You can rush through them for the most part but they aren't fun. 

Overall a really enjoyable experience, you can complete all the achievements in about 50~ish hours, probably less if you speedrun.",1701583716,1701583716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is also really enjoyable, it can get really versatile if you utilize all the gadgets, moves, suit powers.

The story starts a little too slow in my opinion (though by the end it gets more and more interesting), and the side quests are kinda meh, it would have been great to see more supervillains with longer storylines instead of investigating fake Spiderman sightings, catching pigeons and whatnot.

The webslinging is so fluid I remember at times just swinging around New York just enjoying it aimlessly. Coming back now after playing Spider-Man 2, I will say it does expose some flaws especially with the sidequests with the crimes being a gruelling task just to get all done for the 100% completion. Same with the combat since I found myself relying so much on the gadgets to get past enemies with any form of blocking and it felt a lot more repetitive than I remembered compared to the sequel which had symbiote and venom abilities as well as a charged attack all built off of combos and gadgets felt a lot more effective there too, as well as parrying meaning I can just dodge or attack off of an enemy.

This game truly makes you feel like you're Spider_Man  at all times . ""Swinging Into Nostalgia and Innovation: Spider-Man Remastered Delivers a Spectacular Experience""

I recently had the pleasure of diving back into the web-slinging world with Spider-Man Remastered, and I can confidently say that this revamped version of the classic game is nothing short of amazing.

From the moment I swung into action as Peter Parker, I was captivated by the stunning graphics and attention to detail. The remastered edition has breathed new life into New York City, making it a vibrant and dynamic playground for our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The level of detail in the character models, cityscape, and even the smallest details like reflections in puddles truly showcase the power of next-gen gaming.

One of the standout features for me was the improved performance. The seamless transition between fast-paced web-swinging and intense combat is a testament to the technical prowess of the developers. The enhanced frame rate and reduced loading times kept me immersed in the action, eliminating any disruptions and allowing for a more fluid and enjoyable gaming experience.

The addition of the three new suits, inspired by Spider-Man's comic book legacy, adds a delightful touch of nostalgia for long-time fans. It's not just a visual treat, though; each suit comes with its own unique abilities, adding a layer of strategy to the gameplay. Whether I was taking on waves of enemies or soaring through the city skyline, these new suits brought an extra dimension to the already fantastic gameplay.

The reworked lighting and ray tracing effects deserve special mention. The play of shadows across the city, the way the sunlight reflects off Spider-Man's suit – it all contributes to an immersive and visually stunning experience. Exploring the city at different times of day became a joy in itself, as the dynamic lighting created breathtaking scenes that showcased the game's attention to realism.

Beyond the technical upgrades, Spider-Man Remastered stays true to the heart of the original game. The engaging narrative, compelling characters, and the emotional journey of Peter Parker are as impactful as ever. The talented voice cast, coupled with the enhanced facial animations, brings these characters to life in a way that's both authentic and emotionally resonant.

In conclusion, Spider-Man Remastered is a triumph in both nostalgia and innovation. Insomniac Games has not only successfully revitalized a beloved classic but has also set a new standard for what a remastered edition can achieve. Whether you're a longtime fan or swinging into the Spider-Verse for the first time, this game is an absolute must-play. It's a celebration of everything that makes Spider-Man great, and it does justice to the iconic character in every web-slinging moment.

The game includes all the DLC, so you get a ton of content to enjoy. The story keeps you hooked, and the voice acting is top-notch. Plus, the photo mode is a blast – capturing those action-packed moments is too much fun!

1. Doing instant takedowns gets bugged a lot. You need to pause and un-pause the game to fix it. Happens way too often and in your first playthrough where you're trying to get used to the combat system, it can be super jarring and make you think you are legit messing up. It can also lead you to taking BS hits because your take down didn't go off, and I even died once or twice because of it. But it isn't a deal breaker because you can learn to recognize it over time.
2. I have no idea if this was my controller (Xbox One Controller - Brand New Wired), or the game, but there were occasions where the controller would just stop working randomly. Full stop, and I have no idea what causes it. Hell, one time Spiderman just started moving forward on his own and I couldn't do anything about it. However, this only happened once or twice within 50 hours of gameplay. 
3. Wall crawling on specific terrain can lead you to be trapped within a building, which you obviously aren't meant to be. This forces you to restart from your checkpoint, only happened once with me though. 
4. Freezing and crashing isn't abundant per say, but it did happen often enough for me to grow exasperated. A handful of times. Thankfully, the game is quick to start up and the checkpoint system is very good, so you will rarely lose any real progress in or out of missions. 
5. The most important issue and is honestly game breaking is the save corruption issue. This, in my experience, was caused by a certain side mission by [spoiler] Taskmaster [/spoiler]. Sometimes, upon restarting the mission due to failure or just wanting to do so on your own, the game will instantly crash at the loading screen. Normally, this would not be an issue and you would just load back in, but it literally CORRUPTS your save. To save it, you have to do lots of nonsense with your files and it's total horse shit. The fact that this even exists is ridiculous. People could legit lose all their progress in one fell swoop if they aren't computer savvy enough to fix it. Even if you do all that stuff to fix it, you basically have to just avoid that mission like the plague and pray that when you come back to it (for achievements), that it won't do it again. Thankfully, it didn't happen again to me, but it pissed me off heavily. It says a lot that I still recommend this game even with this in it. 

Other than that, the game is pretty great:
Visuals on PC are stunning if your computer can handle it. The story is passable but nothing you wouldn't expect from a Spiderman game or movie. Voice acting is fine as well, but Spiderman's quips during side missions can repeat often if you do a ton of side missions back to back, which sometimes makes me wish he would shut the hell up. Combat is a little awkward to get used to if you are coming from the Batman Arkham games, but it is somewhat similar with the addition of the acrobatics that Spiderman is known for. Swinging through the city feels great and you can fast travel to avoid trips that are a bit too long. 

There are sections where you play as two other characters other than Peter Parker which basically amount to ""avoid enemies and get through the stealth level"". On your first playthrough, these are harmless and end relatively quickly if you aren't impatient and get caught over and over again. But on repeat playthroughs, they suck ass and just drag. But since you beat it already, you can get through the level very quickly. People online threw them lots of shit but they aren't that bad.  

In terms of the DLC content, it's more of the same. Each one leads into the next so they aren't disconnected nothing stories. Everything matters. I only have two real complaints from them:

1. [spoiler] Silver Sable's [/spoiler] role in the third DLC seems really forced. She seemed to actually care at least a little bit about Spiderman's health in the main game before she basically just left the main story off screen. She was troubled but clearly seemed to be rethinking her approach on justice, a positive character change. However, in the third DLC where she returns, her character regresses heavily back into what it was at the start of the main story, which is baffling. The justification for this is that her home country is in a civil war, and it's taken a toll on her head, so she's high strung and stressed out. Not to mention the thugs in NYC are stealing her company's equipment which she needs to fight in the aforementioned war, so she's hell bent on getting it back. Understandable, but the problem arises when you see how she treats Spiderman as not only an ally, but a human being. She outright nearly kills him for this equipment, even as Spiderman outright tells her that he will help her with no strings attached. Granted, her and Spiderman were not friends by the end of the main story, but they were certainly not enemies. She stubbornly refuses his help and it only serves to create conflict for the plot, but it isn't organic. Spiderman has already gone through this song and dance with her in the main story. She has ALREADY placed her trust in him to get jobs done in the main story, so there is really zero reason for her to be so hostile towards him and refuse his help. And that takes up a lot of the plot in the last DLC and it basically wraps up soon after they team up. Hell, it doesn't even take much for her to be convinced. Again, the reasoning for the civil war causing her character change makes no sense in-universe, as it is outright stated that hostilities have been around for a long time, so it isn't like this is some crazy revelation and battles have occurred in the past.  I digress.

2. Screwball, as a character, is terrible. Yes, she is meant to be annoying and obnoxious. However, that doesn't mean it's okay for her to annoy the shit out of the player. If you fail to get the max score on her challenges and you want to ace them, you have to hear the same stupid lines repeated over and over again with horrible internet humor. If she was a one-off character, this wouldn't be a problem, but her missions last throughout all three DLCs. In the main story, she plays an extremely minor role so nobody minds, but she has lots of missions in the DLCs.",1701121085,1701121085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spooder man also loves activating the ""surveillance grid"" that way the cops will know where every citizen is at all times. Didn't pay your fine eh? You may be getting a visit from spooder man.

It's not hard, the story is interesting. I love the characterization of the characters in the game. It's a fantastic game that when you play for the story, it's very rewarding.

Cons: Boring New Game+ system. Nothing interesting or new is added your second go around, you just play on a harder difficulty which by the time you play NG+, is still very easy imo. Would not recommend the NG+, but the base game is solid!",1701034751,1701034751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With enhanced textures, ray tracing, and improved lighting, swinging through the intricately detailed streets of New York feels like a whole new experience. The PC version takes full advantage of the platform, offering a level of visual fidelity that was previously unmatched.Performance on PC is exceptional, delivering a silky-smooth 60 frames per second, and load times are practically nonexistent. The game's core mechanics remain intact, providing the same exhilarating web-slinging and combat that fans fell in love with on console.
The addition of new suits and the enhanced photo mode add a fresh layer of excitement for both new and returning players. While the core gameplay remains unchanged, the PC release is a testament to the timeless appeal of Spider-Man's acrobatic feats.

Gotta say, it's pretty goddamn fun. So much so, that I beat this game 8 times and I still find myself wanting to come back to this masterpiece. And if people have a hard time trying to decide whether or not it's worth it, lemme steer you into the right direction - get this game. You won't be disappointed.

You know the story of spider-man, we all know it all too well, don't need to explain it. If you don't got it, well, time to pick up a spidey comic. Have fun. 

Now this game sets this Peter in the prime time of his life, 8 years ahead since he first became Spider-Man, the best parts of his story with Peter struggling to keep his job, manage his love-life, try to avoid being evicted from his apartment, and being Spider-Man at the same time (Not many believe it, but all this *is* the prime of his life, the best stories are the ones that merge both worlds from Peter and Spider-Man, and the struggles the characters face). This Peter Parker is already 23 years old, he's seen and beaten some of his (more) famous villains from his rogues gallery, but Insomniac games keeps giving us twists and turns, adding intrigue and mystery, and proves they have more and more to show us. This game is an absolute marvel, in terms of everything; from story-telling and gameplay to it's characters and dialogue. It's *this* close to the perfect Spider-Man game that everyone wanted, but alas, it's not without its flaws. 

It's criticisms lie in some cheesy dialogue bits here and there, the repetitive nature of some of the side-activities, the overall tedium that comes with having to grind to upgrade, and a few other nitpicks. Such as features that some fans wanted but the studio prioritising accessibility and user-friendliness to non-gamers and first-timers, rather than making a more complex system of traversal for experienced and demanding players and blah, blah, blah, puddle-gate (from the original release) and so forth. But really? These are...just nitpicks, I know. 

The only REAL flaw, would be this port sometimes having some weird crashes at inopportune moments, which I feel like harms the entirety of the experience, especially when it's this cinematic - Just imagine watching a movie like this but it freezes and CTDs, like at the strangest moments. It's not crashing frequently... Just randomly. It sometimes runs super well for like 5 hours and then sometimes it just crashes 40 minutes after I launch the game. For one thing, I know it can't be my rig, I got a 3070 Ti and 32Gb of RAM, and I'm running this from my M.2 NVME. But that's just my own experience, it's very much anecdotal, I don't believe others have had this same situation though.

Graphically, this game slaps. It looks and runs amazing, with all it's bells and whistles, ray traced lighting and reflections, all the models and puddles, and character models (I know people complained about the new face, stfu), LOD, particle effects,  and even the shadows, etc. It looked great when I played it on PS4, it looks even better here, like hell, I could just watch the city and the scenery all day. I also really enjoy the real-time graphic changes that you get to see, to be able to examine exactly what the hell you're changing in the graphics options as you are doing it, a very useful feature and tool that should be looked into being implemented in future games, and able to change whether you want it to be more performance or quality oriented and know which setting you want on is absolutely nutty.

Get this game. It's an absolute dream that you won't regret it. At surface-level? You'll at least have fun from the swinging and fighting. Beyond that? Invest in the story and characters. Watch the cutscenes, listen to their dialogue, feel their acting. Play the game, not because you have to, but because you want to. 

SIDE NOTE:
Okay so Spider-Man has always been an fantastic character to me. He was a super-relatable superhero, like when he struggled, we didn't feel like his problems were out of this world, they were something that we could sympathise with. Money problems? I get it. Girl trouble? I feel it. We see the constant struggle of making choices of whether he should do one thing or the other, the responsibility that falls onto his shoulders and the consequences that stemmed from his actions, and we get to put ourselves in his shoes - his mask. The fact was...that he was just the average guy doing his best with the hand that fate had dealt him, and we get to see that through all the spectacular stories that were shown about him. He was, and is, the best superhero. And this game did do him justice. Honestly? This game is one of my favourite media portrayals yet (And I loved Spectacular Spider-Man). Just enjoy the ride. I'm just happy it finally came to PC.

""Love seeing you two together again! You always were my favourites.""

I've played the spider-man and spider-man 2 on a PlayStation 2 and this game is everything I've wished those two to be. Story is rather predictable but good, cutscenes are pretty nice (best part is they are 21:9 and not 16:9), mini-games are really easy but still fun and don't get boring, boss fights are satisfying (regular enemy fights get rather repetitive with 3.5 kinds of enemies game throws at you with different faction models).
Best part of this game is swinging around the beautiful city, which is extremely well done.

Skills (unlike the Miles Morales game) are useful, collecting all the backpacks isn't very grindy and was surprisingly enjoyable due to every single item bringing up some lore. Suits are mostly nice-looking and rarely have useless specials.

Stealth is time-consuming and repetitive but has a rewarding feeling - unlike the Miles Morales game, getting detected just throws you into a fight, so your approach must be very careful.

I don't blame them for this, as this makes the game reachable for more people, I just hate it when a machine makes a bad decision for me or web zips in completely the wrong direction.

I love what this game does with it's story, because mid-twenties Peter Parker is a mess and just starting to pull his adult life together is my jam. From a narrative perspective, this game does so much more to introduce characters and plot points that have been part of Spidey's stories over the decades than anything outside of the first two Raimi movies.

The game has an amazing array of difficulty and accessibility options. It has to be one of the best games I've seen for customizing for exactly what kind of experience you want to  have, within the framework that the developers put together.

Gameplay wise, I will say that the whole section with Scorpion, with swaying landscapes, potential drowning, and hallucinations, was just about too much for me. Not only was it overwhelming for me, but it also felt like shoehorning a Scarecrow Arkham level into a Spider-Man game.

Story wise, there are some missteps. Despite seeing first hand the kind of corruption and biases the police have, Spidey is disconcertingly blind to the possibility that any cop could be less than heroic. I'm not expecting the storyline to focus on police corruption and civil rights, but there are definitely some cringe-worthy hero worshipping moments.

There is also what I think can only be called a thematic fail when it comes to how Spidey and the people in the city refer to the Demons versus the other gangs. Since the group is comprised of Chinese immigrants, it's really uncomfortable when dialogue says things like ""Fisk was bad, but he loved this city, but these demons . . . "" It really plays into some xenophobic tropes, casting the good old white organized crime boss as being better for New York than these ""outsiders."" It's not a major theme of the main storyline, but the lines of dialogue get repeated over and over by civilians, cops, and Spidey when he's out and about stopping Demon related crimes.

Narrative and gameplay missteps aside, I loved the story, and I loved the feeling the game gave me. I loved playing with the gadgets, learning how to pull off different moves, and learning enemy weaknesses and tactics. Despite the above flaws, this was an overwhelmingly positive experience for me.",1700896601,1700896601,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I personally found Spider-Man to be frustrating at times when it comes to combat and traversal. Spider-Man might just hop onto the trash bags next to him when you wanted to dodge an AOE attack. He might also zip onto a ledge far away when you wanted him to zip on the water tower in front of you. Things like that might not cause a game over and there are ways to mitigate them, but they are frustrating when they cause a challenge to fail.

It's fun to play anyway, especially when traversing through the city and getting into a nice long combo during a fight. The gameplay gets a bit repetitive towards the end, but at least all the boss fights are unique.",1700863340,1700863340,True,1,0,0.516129016876220703,0,True,False,False

If you haven't played the Shattered Dimension games or Web of Shadows than I'd say you'd probably enjoy this game more than I did, and I enjoy this game a lot I just really love those games.

Overall the story and city of New York are loyal to the comics and all iterations of Spidey, I loved that they included dozens of cosmetic options for Spidey. Letting you craft you own story to a certain extent.

The DLCs are 100% worth it. They are a great expansion that continues the main story from the game. Contrary to most game DLCs, they do not feel like filler, the characters are expanded upon and transformed in very drastic ways. I even thought at points that The City That Never Sleeps storyline was even better than the main game's story. Silver Sable and Black Cat have become two of my favorite characters.

Literal superhero, admired by all of New York, saving millions of lives, young with perfect body, who could do like anything in the world...and yet not good enough for spoiled not so special drama queen who bitches about being treated like a child then calling for help 15 seconds later. Great message to our younger boys here. 
U need to simp and serve to any female that is kind enough to cross path with you and talking to you and even if you have godlike skills, you better settle with that average or below average boring constanly bitching woman who may or may be not even elementary grateful for saving her life 5 times in a week while you COOK for her. Yea and better not leave your clothes anywhere near her even if you are called to save the city, got it? Cuz queen is not here to help you with anything, queen is here to be admired, feared and served.

I know Spiderman is a teenager or something, but who made him a simp and why?

Another NO goes for the game crashes a lot, especially during fast travel and when repeating challenges. In those cases crash is almost 100%. Definitely not being the only one experienced this and yet its still there.

And one more NO for that lame hallucinating part which probably must be in every superhero game.

A Web-Slinging Adventure!

I wanted to share my excitement about the game ""Spider-Man."" It's a truly exhilarating journey filled with dynamic gameplay and incredible possibilities.

The standout feature of the game is undoubtedly its gameplay. Swinging through the city on a web is an absolute thrill. You feel free, like a real superhero, and it's just unbelievably cool. The graphics are top-notch, with every corner of New York City meticulously crafted, creating an incredibly realistic world.

However, there's one aspect that left me with mixed feelings - the bosses. In this regard, the game feels slightly underdeveloped. Some boss battles leave something to be desired, and there's a certain repetitiveness in their mechanics. Perhaps the developers could have added more variety to these moments.

Nevertheless, despite this minor drawback, ""Spider-Man"" is an incredible adventure. The game impresses with its atmosphere, quality of execution, and the capabilities of the main character. If you're a fan of comics or just love great games, then ""Spider-Man"" is an excellent choice!",1700751939,1700751939,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

A strong narrative and game play. This game is something that managed to make both the web swinging and the spider sense feel second nature to utilize but hard to master. This game has potential to be one of the best of the Spider-Man games. Those who are long time fans will be brought back to what  made them fall in love with Spider-Man. The story feels refreshing despite utilizing a familiar cast of characters. If you give this game a chance and go in without the understandable bias of past Spider-Man games this may be in the running for one of your favorite video game iterations of this character. I would recommend 8.5/10.

What can be said about this game. It brings an incredible balance between challenge and rewarding game play.  While in games like the Arkham series the counter button can feel hard to justify in the narrative in Spider-Man it fits like a glove with the powers. The incorporation of classic villains is well done but does not stray too far from the main focus and momentum of the story. The cast of villains allows for the world to be fleshed out while supporting the humanity and struggle that our protagonist and supporting good characters go through. While the main story plot lines are predictable in some beats there is still enough emotion and effort in both the writing and the voice actors to convince the audience of the lives being shown to us in this game.

While there is DLC to the game, one dealing with the Black Cat and one dealing with Silver Sabel, I do find these plot lines the lesser when compared to the main story. In all honesty the dlc did not make me feel like what I was doing meaningful to the main story and felt more like switching to filler episodes between the main season plot lines. As of this review I have not played either sequel to this game so I am unsure of the overall connectivity that these dlcs and the main game's story have with the the other games. However, I am left both wanting more and disappointed that it was not able to be delivered in the dlcs.

My only negative about this game, which is something that I have with some of the previous Spider-Man titles, are some of the challenges that you need to complete to get full suit upgrades or 100% the game. Primarily the Screwball challenges, so much hate. None to the voice actress, I am sure she nailed the character but an embarrassing amount of my time on this game was due to some of these challenges.

REVIEW SCORE
9.0/10 - Base Game and Story
8.5/10 - Base Game + DLC Story

I would recommend but if you are going for the 100% some of the challenges require very specific load outs to have a chance. If you get stuck or cannot figure the combos out I would recommend looking it up but your best friend, no matter the difficulty, is your dodge button.",1700716976,1700716976,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Swinging is the most fun part of the game and still gets boring after around half way point, the combat is extremely basic: button to attack and button to dodge, you can throw in a gadget here and there if you want, but they all do pretty much the same thing. I hate those terrible assassin's creed-like controls, there is exactly zero precision, you press a button and pray the character goes forward. Sidequests aside from very view are generic ubisoft style checkmarks on the map and main missions are just watch a cutscene go place ""A"" beat up bunch of guys do a qte watch cutscene done. Stealth exists and is more boring than already boring combat. Overall game doesn't deserve overwhelmingly positive rating. Don't even see myself finishing this game. Batman arkham series was way better and this game just made me think about replaying it.

Final point MJ is not hot and the side character missions exist. Who thought when buying Spider-man game I would want to play as anyone other than Spider-man?",1700688097,1700688097,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is exciting as hell, the graphics are extremely beautiful, the game runs very smoothly, the gameplay itself is an absolute joy, the game never crashed a single time and there's plently of stuff to do aside from the story missions. Is there anything more to ask for? I don't think so. 

The swinging from roof to roof, running along building's walls, acquiring various combat techniques made for plently of great action. It actually makes you feel like you are the Spiderman. At the very beginning, learning those skills was quite a challenge, but not for to long fortunately and afterwards it became nearly effortless to jump and swing around the city. 

The combat system is great as well. You never have to be afraid to engage in a fight. Due to the mix of different gadgets and attacks you always feel like it's possible to get the upper hand, even while being outnumbered. Websticking enemies to a wall or a car e.g. is hilarious af.

This game also offers tons of different suits for spiderman, each with its own power and beauty. As soon as you get tired of a particular suit, you can simply just select a new one and before you've done that with each suit, you've already finished this game.

Besides the main story there are also lots of side missions to complete like finding lost backpacks, taking pictures of various landmarks, capturing lots of enemy hideouts, warehouses, outposts as well as prisoners camps, taking down lots of criminals all over the city by preventing their crimes, completing Taskmaster's challenges and so on.

Main point:
I would recommend this game for sure for many players. I bet everyone love to ,,fly'' like Spider-Man and that part is done really cool. Also I do like some of combat and items we can use. Skins are great ;)  
This is also a game changer for any future hero type games ;) 
Yet, it is bad with some parts of the game.
Map is full of dumb NPC's all over.
Should be a bit cheaper when adding this to PC later then PS4 version.  
Today game just keep crashing on me no idea why...after 10-15min playing. I didn't have any problems before my break from this game. That part for sure is negative :( 
For me at this point with dlc's score is 9-/10

They have done a lot more ground work into the game now because it's available on a much more powerful system. I really like how you can now change your graphical settings and even enable features like ray-tracing for anyone who likes to spicen up their game a little more. This game literally just released at the time of this review being posted and there are so many things that they have perfected compared to the previous generations of consoles with this game. However, one thing that I think would need a bit of work on is the optimization. The FPS really can drop sometimes depending in what environment you're in or when the in-game cutscenes are rendering.

However, if you're a story-game lover then please try this game out. It's worth every bit of money you spend on it and you won't even regret it.",1660338813,1700596381,True,4,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

First, the plot and overall narrative got to a point where I just couldn't empathize with Spider-Man anymore. The way he was written in this game makes it so that he has a very specific moral compass, and he feels the need to constantly impose it on all of those around him. “You are not like this” or “I can’t let you do that” are perhaps the phrases most employed by him during the game, and it becomes annoying as hell. Writing is not the game’s strong point, and there is quite a bit of it.

Second, the Mary Jane missions are really as uninteresting as other have to you they are; it’s a chore to go through all but one of them, which is ironically the one in which she actually partners with Spider-Man in gameplay terms. Third, the quality of the DLC felt perceptively lower to me in most aspects, and they bring just about nothing new to the game other than tougher enemies... maybe unnecessarily tough, at that. In hindsight, I maybe wouldn’t have played the DLC if I knew how stale they were. To me, the most enjoyable parts were the Screwball challenges, which added actual new ideas that felt fun to accomplish.

So, should you play this game? Well, it’s definitely not a necessity like almost everyone seems to imply. Play it if it feels attractive to you, and maybe skip the DLC.",1700522081,1700522081,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As I write this, I have just finished the main story. But don't worry - I'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible! I have not yet tackled the DLC or 100% completed the game or anything like that, but I loved the entire experience enough that yes, I probably will go the extra mile to do ALL the things.

I don't know much about the team that put this game together, but it definitely FEELS like a passion project, lovingly crafted by a bunch of hardcore Spidey enthusiasts. Whatever your favorite version/portrayal of Spider-Man is, whatever your favorite THING about Spider-Man is, it's represented here. It hits all the right emotional beats, and it's seriously impressive how the action sequences feel like big blockbuster films. There are some villains I'm really looking forward to seeing in this universe that haven't shown up yet, but the ones we DO get are very dynamic and interesting, and the boss fights against them are so much fun and everything I would've hoped for in a video game fight against them. The final boss fight in particular is PERFECTION, as well as a certain team-up boss fight at the end of Act 2.

Spider-Man does have a very similar feel to the Batman: Arkham games. The combat systems are similar in how they're controlled, but I found Spidey's acrobatic flips and jumps way more entertaining and thrilling to watch. Like the Arkham games, there are a lot of stealth sections where you're required to take enemies out one at a time without being seen, and that did feel a bit out of place to me - it's on brand for Batman, but doesn't quite fit the colorful, flashy, wise-cracking style of Spidey. There are also segments where you play as different characters in more stealthy, information-gathering types of missions, and I found them to be a fun break from the action.

And then there's the web-slinging. Woooooooowwwwwwee swinging around the city is SO fun!!! It never gets old. There is a fast travel option, but I found myself rarely using it. Even walking around at street level gets interesting, as people have a variety of different ways they respond to you. Some of them yell conspiracy theories out at you and call you a menace, some come up and high-five you. There is a LOT of life and personality in every aspect of this game. The version of New York City you're in is also very interesting - it's got a blend of real-life streets and buildings, and ones from Marvel's lore. Avengers Tower, the Chrysler building, the Wakanda Embassy, the Empire State Building... I even went out of my way to look for the Osborn penthouse and the Daily Bugle building from Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, because they're real buildings in New York City (and yes, I found them!).

I still intend to play the DLC and do some of the extra collecting, but I already have the sequel, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and am looking forward to playing it! Here's hoping Spider-Man 2 comes out on Steam soon as well for those of us that don't have a PS5. I love this game and I am definitely hooked!!

I was able to just visit certain landmarks like the Bull of Wall Street or the Radio City building from memory. Recognised the place I had a beer with a mate five years ago, a proper trip through memory lane.

The mechanics are so great. It took a bit to get used to but after an hour I was gracefully flying across the Village up towards the Financial District. Combat is really acrobatic as well, and although this likewise takes some getting used to, once you grasp the mechanics and start learning the moves of the enemies you'll start chaining combos with ease. The main missions are engaging, with some fun changes where you play MJ or a character called Miles. The story is top-notch introducing some noteworthy Villains into the mix, starting out strong with an excellent opening mission and building up speed gradually during it's runtime before finishing off even stronger in one of the best final acts I've seen in a video game. The quality writing is also found in the often humorous dialogue and the outright hilarious podcast fragments from J Jonah Jameson, former editor of the Daily Bugle.

There's plenty of side content, and I did it all because it didn't feel tedious. Sure it has collectables in the form of backpacks hidden on skyscrapers or underneath bridges, and you're supposed to sneak a pic of some of this Marvelised Manhattan's famous landmarks, but because the gameplay, and especially the zipping around the city is so much fun, these collectables are just things you pick up over the course of the game. Or the first Act, in my case. There's several side missions, and a number of enemy bases that add additional gameplay into the mix, and during the campaign there is random street crime popping up all around you allowing you to climb into the role of that Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man we all know and love.

All in all the main campaign and 100% completion of the map (but without nailing gold on all challenges) took me 35 hours, with plenty of time spend just swinging around. There's also DLC included which adds about another 12 hours to the game. Although not as good as the main game, it's still excellent with some really fun missions. The dynamic between Black Cat and Spider-Man in the first DLC is particularly great. Finally there's a NG+, though after 47+ hours of swinging around Manhattan, I'm gonna give that a rest for now.",1699054858,1700440083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am sort of amazed how they waste such potential and scale. And also by the fact that people bought consoles to play those.

The only fun thing is web slinging and going through city (and it takes some time to get used to it).
Controls are unresponsive - you shoot web or kick after about half second. And It actually gets you in trouble sometimes when you do chasing missions. And more often when you fight: you do wrong moves on wrong targets and so on.
Obligatory, totally boring grind such as getting tons of backpacks, doing photos, doing boring researches. All felt like chore and not fun at all.
Fisk building sites - literally outposts from Far Cry.
Why lock roaming movements as skills? It should be available as default so you can fiddle with it while going through city.
Uninspiring stealth, uninspiring boss fights with zero flexibility and i almost didn't get into the story.
Dead and empty so-called open world.
Chasing missions are exhausting.
Lab researches with circuits are not challenging and are complete waste of time. In Bioshock you could buy out or use autohack when you really don't want to put pipes manually.
At least graphics look pretty nice.

Вторичная вторичность. ""Сыграйте"" в игру на ютубе.

Я удивлен тому, что такой потенциал и масштаб сливают в помойку. Ну и тому, что люди реально брали консоли, чтобы поиграть в эти игры.

Единственное, что весело делать, это летать по городу (и то нужно еще приспособиться к управлению).
Управление не особо отзывчивое - выстрел паутиной или удар происходит где-то через полсекунды. И это даже приводит к проблемам в миссиях с погонями. А в драках и вовсе получаются не те приемы не по тем целям.
Гринд-обязаловка: собери рюкзаки, пофотай местность, поделай исследования. Все это тупо ощущалось какой-то рутиной и просто не радовала.
Зачистка строек Фиска - тупо аванпосты из Far Cry.
Зачем прятать трюки с паутиной для путешествия по городу в скиллах? Это надо было отсавлять сразу доступным, чтобы веселее было перемещаться по городу.
Душный стелс, душные бои с боссами с нулевой гибкостью. И это я толком сюжет не начал.
Пустой и мертвый так называемый ""открытый мир"".
Миссии с преследованием просто изнуряют.
Исследования в лабе со схемами вообще не напрягают и непонятно для чего их добавили. В Биошоке можно было тупо выкупить или использовать автохак, если совсем влом было трубы эти выставлять.
По крайней мере, графика неплохая

[h2] My Experience [/h2]
This was one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had, this is the best open-world game I have ever played since
[u] TLOZ: Breath of The Wild [/u] in 2019 and the UI looks almost as good if not better. The character designs look good, there are many different things you can do, the game feels emotional but intense at the same time.

[h2] Controls [/h2]
So the controls are really good, even if they feel a little clunky sometimes there still isn't really anything to criticize about.
The swinging feels good, it's super satisfying and easy to learn.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
SPOILER ALERT:
Let's get straight to the point, the gameplay is SUPER GOOD. But sometimes it just feels too Intense when you have 30 Demons and 15 Sable Agents on your ass. (Yes I'm talking about the moments before the last Mr. Negative fight) 
Of course you can change the difficulty, but I personally like playing games the way they are supposed to be played. 
But anyway the fighting feels good, the movement looks fresh and the gameplay is not too difficult at all. Now there is a slight stealth aspect to the game and I know some people wont like that but it's not too bad.

[h2] Graphics [/h2]
The graphics in this game are amazing, and I don't even have an RTX graphics card so I can't use ray-tracing (I have a GTX 1660 Super). 
The game never even really lagged for me either, the character designs look fresh (As I mentioned before), 
All the buildings look nice, trees look good and I don't really know what else to say.

[h2] The Story [/h2]
BIG SPOILER WARNING:
The story in this game feels intense, emotional, sad, and heartwarming all at the same time. The start of the game when Peter almost gets evicted as always is nothing special really, but after that when Fisk get defeated, Fisk Tower gets blown up from the inside and you get introduced to the Demons, the game really starts. GR-27 is still a mystery and you're trying to find out what it is. The city hall bombing happens and you find out that it has something to do with the Demons.
Then you sneak into the Oscorp Tower and invade the government database infrastructures, it feels like a whole movie. 
Now i wont spoil anything anymore but I'm sure that every single person who likes the Spider-Man Movies will like this game.

[h2] More Information [/h2]
I haven't completed this game 100% yet, but i have completed the main story. And my older brother has 233 hours on this game and he loved every single bit of it, he did play the DLCs and has 100% on this game but i would think that like 60$ is pretty cheap for 233 hours of fun and enjoyment i have like 200 hours on [u] TLOZ: Breath of The Wild [/u] and that game is 60$ but i have 100% completed it like 5 times so i would say 60$ for this game is a pretty good deal",1699137731,1700410886,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

I want to play it but not before finishing this one, and I didn’t want to wait 2 years for it to come to PC. Some console games really require you to accept low fidelity or bad performance (and it’s not uncommon to experience both), but the one exception to this issue is games from PlayStation Studios like Insomniac, who are technically experienced and know how to ship a beautiful, performant game on the PS5 hardware. I have no doubt that Nixxes will release a superior version on PC, just like they did here with the first game, but I just didn’t want to wait. 

This Spider-Man remastered is the PC version of the PS5 game that featured upgrades like ray traced reflections, UW support, support for upscaling tech (DLSS/FSR 2/XeSS/and Insomniac’s own Temporal upscaler), and DLSS Frame Generation feature for RTX 4000 cards is also present in this game. The game is a showcase of Nixxes’ ability to port games to PC at a higher quality level than pretty much anyone else. They are just so awesome, I love them and feel that they are a beacon of hope in the current era of PC gaming which is experiencing dark times in 2023. It’s ironic that they are owned by PlayStation, but as long as PC players benefit, it doesn’t really matter. 

The game itself is a very fun Spider-Man, open world game with a focus on the narrative. It took me almost 40 hours to complete this and I didn’t complete all of the side content or the DLCs yet. This is why I don’t trust HLTB’s estimates, people play through games at different speeds. It’s not like I spent 10 hours webbing up and down the streets of manhattan doing nothing, 80% of my time was focused on the main storyline and the the other 20% was spent doing side content like complete base challenges and collecting backpacks. I could have done it a little faster maybe, but not in 17.5 hours (HLTB’s estimate).

If you are a fan of Marvel comics/TV/films (I don’t blame you if you’re not), then you should enjoy this game. The Marvel that I grew up with in the 90s animated shows and comics as a kid is somewhat different than the heavily, heavily commercialized Disney version of Marvel in 2023. It turns me off to a lot of Marvel stuff nowadays, I feel that a lot of the original stories have been somewhat undermined and lessened in value because of Disney’s need to maximize profits making an unlimited number of TV shows, films, video games, merchandise, etc etc. This is relevant because despite me feeling this way about modern day Marvel, I still enjoyed this game and had a fun time with it. I think it’s worth full price if you want to buy it immediately, but the smarter move is to wait for a sale, Sony always discounts their games for the big Steam seasonal sales.",1700156201,1700156201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed this iteration of Spider-Man. It's a classic remaster of what a lot of people, me included, loved on the PS2, too bad we didn't get that classic pizza delivery theme. I like the newer actor's face capture, it feels more ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,"" the original just doesn't seem right to me.

The combat is great, it's the Arkham gameplay with combos and finishers and flows great, very fluid, especially after unlocking a decent portion of the skill tree, which doesn't take too long. The finisher animations are great as well, except for that one wrestling finisher with the unnecessary double slow-mo....

The world and story go pretty good together. It's a pretty solid chunk of time just to get through the main story, and they jam-pack a LOT into every nook and cranny of the world. Manhattan's split up into about 8 sections, each of which has collectibles, side quests, and oh-so-many crimes to stop (seriously, I could've 100% the game about 2hrs sooner if there weren't so many damn crimes, and in the DLCs too!). The traversal mechanics are great, and really make you feel like Spider-Man, though they do get just a touch stale after maybe halfway through the game, where you can almost predict each motion Spidey's gonna make, a bit of variety would've been nice here, and the Miles Morales sequel does this much better.

The characters are cast perfect for their roles, Doc Oc feels like Doc Oc, MJ feels like MJ, and Pete definitely feels like a Spider-Man. The lab missions almost feel like a side-bit to the story, not relevant to stopping the main villain, as you watch Octavius' slowly spiral into madness, until suddenly he's not such a side character anymore, which is done really well, and the Act II finale really pulls you in and starts to feel much more serious than the first arc of the game.

The DLCs are pretty well done, very short but I think that's fine considering there's three of them. As for map content, I think they went a bit overboard with all the forts/hideouts. Fisk, Demons, Sable, Prisoners, one of each in every district started to feel like homework when it came to cleaning up the map, and similar to the movement I think Miles Morales' sequel did this much better.

Overall it's a solid implementation of what most people expect for the classic Spider-Man experience, if you enjoyed any of the Tobey Maguire movies as a kid you'll love this.",1700126886,1700126886,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Strong recommend even if you're like me and not someone who's super into superhero stuff and Spider-Man specifically. Combat is fun, web swinging is amazing, the open world is large enough to really enjoy exploring around, and small enough to feel like it's ""completable"" unlike some open world games these days (hem hem, Ubisoft). 

I appreciate that the game skips the origin story we've all seen a million times and takes you straight into the meat. It builds slowly but then you get some really great character moments both with Peter & MJ, but also between Peter and his enemies and new friends along the way. Really enjoyable. I do wish the side activities (specifically the labs and crimes) were a bit less repetitive, but that's fine. It's also fun to have so many Spidey suits to unlock and choose from.

I have some mixed notes about performance. On the one hand, it performs AMAZINGLY. I get 100 fps + the vast majority of the time on my 3070ti + i5-13600k, with everything set to ultra. I did eventually have to drop Ray Tracing and a couple other settings because I was getting severe frame drops after playing the game for more than 30-60 minutes. It's reminiscent of a memory leak issue where the longer you play, the worse the performance gets, but dropping RT helped tremendously. 

However, my big gripe with performance is the crashing. This game crashes A LOT. Most of the time, it's on loading screens, but every once in a while while playing as well (usually when swinging around for me). It's extremely frustrating, because the save also ""breaks"" and you can't load it again without either validating the files, or in my case, loading in on my Steam deck, progressing a little to a new save, then reloading on my PC. This happens way, way too often, and has often left me feeling negatively towards the game after a solid enjoyable session just ends and I can't continue without jumping through hoops. I've taken to keeping three separate manual saves to make sure I don't lose too much progress when it happens. 

Overall, I'd give it a strong recommendation with the caveat that the frequent crashes detract a lot from the experience, so make sure you have the patience to deal with that.",1699978032,1699978032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

*****************************
Played sessions of 2-3 hours in a row, IF YOU CAN GET IT TO RUN.
Wanted to refund but played past the min time.

- turning off DLSS, helps. Sometimes it runs.
- shutting down, turning on the PC helps. (NOT RESTARTING)
- Dont click 'continue'. Load from manual save, helps.
- reinstalled, still crashing
- Validate files, still crashing
- revert to previous version 1 and 2, still crashing
- Turned off overwolf
- turned off nvidia overlay

Complaining to studio, triggered a series of out of box ""turn off and on/reinstall"" kinda responses.

Today, is not the day. Turn off/on, load from different save points, doesnt help. Loads into the game, 3-5 seconds later, it crashes.

What a sad port. Great game.
Not sure who screwed up the port. NVIDIA? Studio? Steam???

Absolutely one of the best games to come out in the last decade. Insomniac revived a franchise that hadn't had a great game since the ps2 days and they absolutely smashed it. From story to gameplay this game is just *fun*. I never use fast travel because swinging around is just so [u]fun[/u]. I never get tired of the combat because it's just [u]fun[/u]. 

Whether you're a hyper critical player or a chilled out lil goofy guy playin' games, I can honestly recommend it to everyone.

The only cons I have, and these seem extremely PC specific, are that the physics on some things (ragdolls, objects after you throw them and they hit something) seem to depend on your framerate, and because mine is quite high (100+ at all times) it looks goofy as hell. This wasn't and still isn't a thing on the playstation. The rest of the physics in the game work just fine, though. 

Secondarily, and it's been a while since I played through the full story on Playstation, but there were WAY more visual glitches in this. They tended to be cases where an object from the game world stayed loaded in to a cutscene, so a person just phased through a car, or had a mailbox blocking them and such.

The last is something that I [u]know[/u] for a fact is PC specific, and it does not matter which controller you use. There seems to be a bug where finishers/suit powers, basically anything requiring 2 inputs will stop working. Sometimes even the gadget button. This seems to be related to scene changes like cutscene to gameplay or vice versa but sometimes it just clocks out. As I mentioned above, I have completed the game many times on PS4/5 and not once had as much trouble as I do with this sometimes. It could also be tied to framerate. This usually isn't too big an issue but the challenges in the game it's a nightmare.

This game claims to have 22 supported languages. Yet only english is working after your first boot up. On first boot up you will get to choose language. But when booting up second time that choice has been completely ignored and no matter what you do the game voices and subtitles plus HUD stays in english.

The game it self is okay. The story is expected an okay spider-man story.
I think more could've been done to reach a broader audience. And younger audience that isn't english speaking yet.
Sony have cheaped out on the voice acting hiring for this one and i think that is mostly what drags this game down in what it deserves. The game it self is not bad but also not that engaging. As it's all way too easy to control (so seems like a game made for kids) Yet the only language that actually works is english (not for kids in none english speaking countries and regions).

[b]Insomniac Games has really managed to capture the feeling of being like Spider-Man. It's a lot of fun swinging around the city fighting criminals. Towards the end, however, some activities feels a bit repetitive.[/b]

[h3]Story & Characters.[/h3]
The story is good and interesting and really feels like a typical Spider-Man story. However, it is quite predictable. All of the most famous characters are there, like MJ, Aunt May, the Osborns, etc. Miles Morales is also introduced, and fits well into the story. They really nailed Peter Parker. He is funny and a bit insecure, as he should be. The game also has humor, which made me laugh more than once.

[h3]The World & Graphics.[/h3]
The city of New York is very beautiful, and I can't really complain about the graphics. The city feels very free and alive, whether you are running on the streets, jumping over rooftops, or swinging between buildings. People on the street talk to you and adore you, giving you a high five sometimes. If you stand in the middle of the street, the cars will honk their horn, wanting you to move out of the way. Birds on the rooftops fly away as you come running and jumping. And more. You can swing with your webs from anything you can imagine that you can swing from, such as buildings, trees, lampposts, etc. The swinging is very fun, and even though there is a fast travel system, I found myself swinging across NYC instead. So well done, Insomniac.

[h3]Missions, Challenges, & Activities.[/h3]
There are only a few side quests to do, but regardless of main quest or side quest, the quests are varied and it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing more than once. There are also lots of different activities to do, like collectibles to find, enemy bases to conquer, some Taskmaster challenges to tackle, and more. Some of the activities become quite repetitive after a while, such as stopping random encounters with criminal gangs in the city. All challenges, activities and collectibles are clearly marked on the map, and emit a large beam into the air so they are easy to find. Very nice and easy to get 100% on this game without having to check a guide! 

So about the Taskmaster Challenges. There are 4 different challenges in the game; Combat, Stealth, Bombs, and Drones. The one most important criterion on which you’re judged in Taskmaster Challenges is speed. Whether you’re beating down enemies, stealthing through a hideout, chasing drones, or defusing bombs, it’s all about how fast you can finish the task. In the Batman games, there were certain objectives you HAD to master to get the highest score. In this game it doesn't really matter how you complete the challenge, it doesn't really matter if you get hit many times in a combat challenge and so on, as long as you complete the challenge fast enough. This was a bit disappointing in my opinion. The drone challenges were the most annoying in my opinion. All of these different challenges are not as fun as in the Arkham games, and they are also much easier. The DLC also adds some new challenges, the Screwball challenges, and those were really annoying. It was all about photobombing, and I hated that.

[h3]Enemies & Bosses.[/h3]
There is a decent variety of enemies in the game, and some have to be defeated in a certain way. Some enemies, for example, have shields or electric batons and you can't just hit them straight ahead, just like in the Batman games.

You get to meet many famous bosses during the game which was fun, like Electro, Doctor Octopus, Vulture etc. The only thing that I found a bit annoying about the bosses was that the bosses do not have a visible health bar. I like to see how much damage I do and how much HP a boss has left.

[h3]The Combat.[/h3]
The combat is very similar to the Batman Arkham games. On the other hand, I think that the Batman games were more fun when it comes to this part. I wouldn't say it's necessarily ""better"" combat in Batman, but it's a little different. If you try to play as Batman in this game, you will get beat. You can't just stand your ground like Batman can. You have to think more like Spider-Man, jump around a lot, use your gadgets often, etc.

The combat in this game is more ""chaotic"". There are too many things happening at once sometimes, like rockets coming at you from rocket launchers while a shielded enemy charges you and leaves an AOE DOT on the ground as well, so even if you dodge the rocket and the charge, you might land in that AOE DOT anyway. In this game, you can't make a counter attack in the same way as in the Batman games. In this game, when the counter icon appears above the head, you have to dodge instead, and if you time it perfectly you will also shoot web back at that enemy, making them open for an instant takedown.

I think that both Batman himself and the combat system have more variety in the Arkham games. Both when it comes to how you build the combos and the variety of animations and takedowns. Spider-Man does more or less the same thing, shooting webs or kicks, and it looks very much the same all the time.

In the Batman games freeflow combat system, you could press the attack button when you were as far as maybe 15-20 meters away from the enemy, and Batman would close the gap on that enemy and punch that enemy. You did not have to run over to the enemy you wanted to hit, you only had to press the attack button and Batman ""flew"" over there, without losing the combo. This was very smooth, and it is not the case in this game. In this game, it only works up to maybe 2 meters. Otherwise Spider-Man just stands there and kicks in the air, which was a bit annoying at first. You don't lose the combo from this, but still. You just have to remember to use your web instead to close the gap on the enemy. All of this may just be a matter of preference and getting used to, but in that case I prefer the Batman Arkham style combat more.

[h3]Crashing.[/h3]
I don't know why, but this game crashed very often for me, and it made me very frustrated at times. I tried many different graphics settings, even turned some of them off, but it didn't help. It seems many others have had similar problems. This happened mostly during the challenges in the game. I played a challenge, and every time I failed it or wanted to restart it, the game crashed. It ruins the experience a bit, having to restart the game all the time. During my 47 hours of playtime, the game must have crashed at least 30 times, no joke. I don't have old computer parts either.

[h1]The Verdict.[/h1]
If you are looking for a superhero game that makes you feel like the superhero yourself in an open world, and is similar to the Batman Arkham games, then I highly recommend that you try this out. 4/5.",1699694862,1699699810,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphically, the game looks fantastic! Especially at 165 frames per second and with the settings cranked up to the maximum.

The storyline of the game is wonderful and interesting. I've always loved Spider-Man as a hero, and, in my opinion, the development studio brought him to life in a very interesting and solid way. Cutscenes are superb, the direction is mind-blowing, and the actors play vividly. Spider-Man cracks jokes and makes comments. All of this brought me delight.

But, oh gods, the developers stretched the game in the most disgusting way for me by stuffing it with a huge pile of repetitive activities! I would have been completely satisfied with this game if it could be completed in about twenty to twenty-five hours.

Maybe, again, it's my problem that I decided to play it all at once. But when each DLC offered me to clear bases and solve crimes again, I honestly howled!

The technical state is also strange. In the second act, when fast-travel [i](and during loading)[/i] in the northern part of the city, the game simply crashed for me. I fixed this by changing the resolution and reducing all the settings, but in the third act, the issue resolved itself. But I remembered the good old times when you had to save manually and almost resort to save-scumming.

They give you a piece of the plot, and then you fly around the whole map for damn two hours clearing ""outposts."" Outposts, while entertaining with Peter's commentary, made me just turn on YouTube and start zoning out. Between some missions, the hero suggests closing activities in the city [i](in the DLC, it seems to happen after every mission, even though the DLCs are very short)[/i]. But they generously load you with content: crimes of criminals, crimes of saboteurs, crimes of cuckoldry, paintings, backpacks [i](backpacks are okay, actually)[/i], audio diaries, hidden photo places, bases, prison bases, sledgehammer bases, sables bases . By the twenty-fifth hour of gameplay, I was honestly tired [i](how I squirted when in the third act they again suggested clearing the city)[/i]. In the end, I tried to skip as many skirmishes as possible, as I had reached the maximum level and just didn't want to engage in yet another monotonous battle.

I probably didn't mention stealth; well, I'm not lazy, why is it even needed here? Thanks for making it passable enough.

Progression was both sufficient and insufficient for me simultaneously. But starting from the DLC, there was nowhere to put the experience, and it would have been nice to add some possibilities.

The DLCs are very short in terms of the story [i](even considering that there are missions with escort and eavesdropping, we still love them, right?)[/i], and they stuffed the same formula of additional activities as in the main game to vacuum the city once again.

Mixed feelings about the game. I can't say the game is bad, but I'm tired of it. Thumbs up because the game was purchased [b]on sale[/b], and the story is genuinely enjoyable.",1699585235,1699585792,True,2,0,0.546142220497131348,0,True,False,False

the combat just isn't as sharp as something like arkham either; there were so many times where I'd get locked into an animation and be unable to do anything about a grenade or times when a rocket comes at me from off screen without warning  

if I had to single out a particular issue that kind of made me regret playing this though, it'd be the copoganda
I knew it was going to be a thing going in, but I had no idea that it was going to be egregious as it was.
where that sort of thing can make sense with more neo-liberal characters like batman, it just makes no sense here
it might just be my 'I watched 90s spiderman' bias talking but spiderman being as chummy as he is with the pigs just feels downright icky in a way that clashes with the character's themes and makes him feel more like a thug bashing narc rather than an empathetic hero who wants to actually help people

This remaster enhances what was already considered one of the best superhero games to date, making it an even more compelling experience.

The narrative remains one of the game's strongest suits. It tells an original story that is not tied to any existing comic book or film, giving the developers at Insomniac Games the freedom to explore mature themes and craft a narrative that is both respectful of the source material and fresh. Peter Parker is portrayed with a depth that captures his dual life as a young adult grappling with personal challenges and his heroic alter-ego Spider-Man. The story is replete with emotional beats, well-placed humor, and a portrayal of iconic characters that feel three-dimensional and real.

Visually, the remaster is a triumph. It's not simply a higher resolution pass but a comprehensive upgrade. Improved textures, better lighting with ray tracing capabilities, and enhanced character models bring New York City to life with astonishing detail. The remaster takes full advantage of the hardware capabilities of the PlayStation 5, delivering not only a more beautiful rendition of the game but also one that benefits from reduced loading times and smoother performance.

Gameplay in ""Spider-Man Remastered"" remains as fluid and engaging as ever, with the remaster enhancing the experience with more stable frame rates and responsive controls. Swinging through the city is an unparalleled joy, with an intuitive system that makes traversal an integral part of the game's appeal. Combat is dynamic and encourages creativity, allowing players to combine Spider-Man's acrobatic skills and gadgets in exhilarating ways.

The sound design and musical score are also noteworthy, with the remaster ensuring that audio fidelity is top-notch. The orchestral score dynamically changes with the action, and the environmental sounds of the city add a layer of immersion that is crucial for a game that thrives on its setting.

One significant change in the remaster is the new face model for Peter Parker. While initially a point of contention among fans, this change brings Peter's appearance more in line with the voice actor's facial structure, enhancing the performance capture and emotional expressions in the game.

In terms of content, ""Spider-Man Remastered"" includes not just the base game but also all three chapters of the ""The City That Never Sleeps"" DLC, providing even more narrative content and gameplay. This makes the remastered edition the definitive version of the game, offering the complete experience in one package.

The game also offers accessibility features, making it more inclusive to a broader range of players. These include options for subtitle customization, different control schemes, and visual aids, ensuring that as many players as possible can enjoy the game.

In conclusion, ""Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered"" refines and enhances an already exceptional game. It's an ode to the beloved character of Spider-Man, a technical marvel that pushes the boundaries of the hardware, and a narrative adventure that tugs at the heartstrings while providing adrenaline-pumping action. For its captivating story, exhilarating gameplay, and stunning visual presentation, ""Spider-Man Remastered"" is a must-play for anyone with the opportunity to experience it on the PlayStation 5 and PC",1699462276,1699462276,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

way too button mashy 
worst part of the game i think 
at least it looked cool
the bosses were pretty darn easy though
just mash the attack button and dodge occasionally and you'll win
even if how easy they were, they were fun to fight (especially the sinister six fights)
(i literally beat martin li 2 on my first try)
the swinging was fun but it felt like i had practically no control over anything most of the time
the fastest i could go didn't feel as fast as it should have, but that just might be because the game was built with a ps4 in mind
i'm probably the only person who actually liked the mj/miles sections 
i kinda want them to make a whole game just around that style alone just with a few improvements

the story was pretty decent 
i enjoyed it as much as any other generic superhero story 
i expected it to be longer cus for some reason people kept telling me that the game was long when it only took me 14,3 hours to beat on spectacular (the highest difficulty from a completely new save that hasn't already beaten the game once before)
oh and the voice acting was pretty good

idk what else to say honestly
7/10
would spider-man again

ALSO the steam version has some weird crashing bug that makes the game crash over and over 
not a *huge* deal breaker but it was pretty darn annoying

So being able to swing through new york as my childhood's favourite superhero brought back many memories and nostalgia. The game may not pose any great challenge, but it is pleasant in its simplicity. The greatest advantage of the insomniac studio's production is its stunning graphics, which bring a cinematic experience during cutscenes. Side activities in the open world of Marvel's Manhattan are simple, but the most fun for me was just swinging around the city. Patrolling New York City looking for villains is truly immersive. Without beating around the bush, the game is worth recommending, but it is worth waiting for a discount because the price of $60 may not suit everyone for a game with about 40 hours of gameplay including expansions.

I honestly don't think I can say much about the game beyond that, which other people haven't already addressed, but I'll add my voice to the many others recommending this game.

If you've ever wanted to play a Spider-Man game that gave you the perfect Spider-Man experience, swinging around the skyscrapers of Manhattan, New York City, beating up bad guys, defeating super villains, helping local residents, and also playing Peter Parker when the time calls for it, look no further than this game. It perfectly encapsulates that experience, with a little ""hi-tech flair"" added to the mix.

Also, this isn't the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man, or Andrew Garfield Spider-Man, or even your Tom Holland Spider-Man, this is a new Spider-Man entirely, with his own version of the story, and his own conclusion, his own villains, and so on. The game contains a lot of extra Spider-Man suits that can make him *look* like those other Spider-Men, but that's mostly just a neat bit of fanservice for the really hardcore Spider-Man fans.

Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world game, so of course it comes with the usual trappings of an open world game like collectible items, photo challenges, mini-games, side-quests and radio towers, so if you're not a fan of that, be warned. That being said, it's not as bad as stuff like the Assassin's Creed games, where there's more than 200 feathers scattered across multiple cities, and they're functionally worthless. Here they serve a purpose in the form of upgrading resources for your equipment.

This Remastered Edition comes with all the DLC attached, so there's nothing extra you have to buy, not even cosmetics. Everything must be earned in-game, so if there's a specific suit you've been eyeing, you can't just pull out your wallet for it, which is refreshing. You get the entire game with a one-time purchase, something you kinda miss these days. (Looking at you, Ubisoft).",1699306930,1699306930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The writing, especially Spideys, is excellent, the VAs do a splendid job at portraying their respective characters, there's so much to do and so much room to do it in, combat is a spectacle, just challenging enough, and as varied as you want it to be, music is catchy and fitting, and the web-swinging is genuinely the most enjoyable traversal in a game like this that I experienced. It does Spidey justice in so, so many ways.
I think the two points I can bring up as negative - enemies seriously dogpiling you and fast chase scenes losing momentum when you slam into a tiny corner of a building - can't even really be chalked up as negatives; if you're more skilled at this than me, you won't have problems with either.

story was ok, felt some time flow inconsistencies in the end tho. it was nice that the city literally went to shit and you could feel it.
sometimes it felt that moves requiring 2 buttons sometimes wouldn't trigger
also would have liked to have the option to go a darker path

Unlike other games, taking photos and collecting backpacks are a breeze and refreshing between main missions. Sometimes you can play in the perspective of another character which allows you to get to know characters in a more personal way. Overall, I could put countless hours into this game.

Extensive: Now that I've played 25 hours+ hours, I can give a solid review. Well, it's Spider-Man, Do you want to fight crimes? Do you want to be a hero or menace? Do you want something to do in your spare time? It covers all of this. Never in my life have I avoided a fast travel system so quickly after it was introduced. It's unnecessary unless you only have time for short play sessions, just traverse the map as intended. The story was decent and the more you progressed, the more it got tougher. If you are new to this game, I'd recommend playing on the Friendly Neighborhood (Very Easy) or Friendly (Easy), this is due to me playing normal and still being beaten uncontrollably. If you want a challenge then go for Amazing (Normal), Spectacular (Hard), or Ultimate (Very Hard). Various villains were great to see and they all had equal on-screen time which blew me away. I highly recommend playing the DLC as it expands upon the story and adds many side missions which allows you more tokens to unlock suits, skills, etc. Plus if you are planning to play Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, it's best to work towards that story-wise.",1699039731,1699190880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, one major flaw with the game is how often it crashes. Every so often, the game will just crash. This seems to be an experience many people are having. It's not a gamebreaking issue, but it's definitely annoying.

It's not Batman Arkham, despite what people say. The controls (PC) are awkward, especially during quicktime events where you actually have to look at the keyboard.

I get they want to make it like Gotham, just bigger and more and better. I just don't get why they don't use the huge rooster of Marvel villains to put up more interesting side missions, but let us photograph landmarks (repeated later with plushy cats) and catch pidgeons.

Don't get me wrong, it's certainly an AAA game, and it's fun, I like it, and I'll play the sequels. But it's not Batman Arkham.

Web swinging is great, the best it's been in a long time though it's a little slow. I am a big fan of spider-man games so I'm quite picky with thr Web swinging system. It's not perfect, not really physics based enough, I do think the original spider-man 2 has the better Web swinging, but this is close second.

I didn't give Spider-man series the chance early, because i wasn't confident i would enjoy a super hero game, but i was surprisingly hooked by it!
I am a marvel fan since childhood, especially spider-man is one of the heroes i was reading comics with.

The game is just amazing! It has a well written story line, amazing narrative, and the combat and web-slinging mechanics will make it feel like you want to lose hours just exploring the city.

I really have to address the fact that i had a major bug in the second episode of the DLC, the Turf Wars. My game just crashes every time i launch the dlc, i tried a second save file and it still crashes, which is disappointing because i wanted to go 100%. But tbh, the bug is not enough for me to give a negative review to it!

Not sure how they made the research missions so bad but they made some of the story missions even worse. Plenty of unskippable cutscenes despite some of them being skippable. Plus, they ducked up the default controller config for steam (again), so button prompts are broken in the very first level, and you CANNOT change it outside big picture mode. Why Steam? You are also required to have your controller on before you even contemplate starting the game or it won't recognize it, so just a heads up for literally everyone to ever play the game that you'll have to troubleshoot these. However, whoever made the MJ/Miles missions mandatory instead of putting a ""skip mission"" button when they remastered it needs to have their walking privileges revoked. Absolutely did not finish the game, nobody in the history of the world has thought ""Man, there's way too much Spider-man in my Spider-man game! Wish I could play as someone else!""

Given a year of patches and a modernized PC, it is really not great to have two crashes by the time I got out of Octavious' lab for the first time. The first crash was when I tried to access Accessibility Settings at the first QTE in the game (I prefer to hold during those instead of tap), the second was when leaving the lab for the first time (perpetual loading screen, force quit after 5 minutes). 

I am really disappointed to have this happen. The game has been out for over a year and I have a good PC. I should not have to worry about crashes.


EDIT: After many more hours playing, the crashes are getting worse. At first, they were often when pausing and exiting the window for a while, then when trying to reload Last Checkpoints (for the Challenges unlocked later in the game), and now I can't even load into my save file from the main menu without a crash.",1698379377,1698881838,False,0,0,0.428571403026580811,0,True,False,False

- Decent story, at least in the main story dlc was not really my cup of tea; Except for black cat dlc 
-Good combat, but don't play it on to easy. Otherwise you won't even need to use your gadgets, it will become boring very fast otherwise
- Performance was more than decent, but my pc is way overkill for this game. So i can't judge on this one. 

Cons

Very lame puzzles, but golden advice you can turn the puzzles off in the menu. I guess the developers realized that their puzzles where lame 

Mj and miles are freaking annoying, but lucky their missions where very short.

YOu encountered people playing chess, but never got the option to play a game with them. Instead we got tons of annoying lame puzzles in this game. 

The challenges with screwball was also not really my thing

Some people mentioned save issues,

Conclussion more cons than pro's, but overall i still enjoyed this game. I really think its worth the price tag. But if you dind't played the batman games yet, that should still be your first pick. You can pick those games up way cheaper and are for me still the best hero games",1698864965,1698864965,True,2,0,0.505456030368804932,0,True,False,False

Also Miles Morales doesn't even exist in a universe where peter Parker was still alive when he was introduced. The devs knew this but they even add forced MJ misson in the games dlcs. The MJ missons are so bad they honstly made me want to completely stop playing the game after I got to them. Also MJ is such a B#tch to Peter is this game for absolutely no reason. Also the whole Harry Osborn as a werid uncureably disease was incredibly stupid and was done in that crappy Amazing spiderman 2 movie. The game still doesn't match the quailty of say the Batman Arkham games as writing in Spiderman 1 while decent isn't great and they kind stray a little bit to far from the source material unlike the batman games that could technically be in the same universe as the comics or even the  batman animated series. Combat was decent but not great but the games traversal was amazing. Its also a great pc port.",1698714943,1698714943,True,1,0,0.424561411142349243,0,True,False,False

The excitement didn't fade, prompting me to instantly purchase the Spider-Man Remastered without any doubts. Upon diving into the Remastered version, I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics are undeniably impressive, adding to the game's overall appeal. For fellow Spider-Man enthusiasts eagerly awaiting Spider-Man 2 Remastered's release on PC, this is a must-play. Although the PC version might take a while, who knows what the future holds? Stay optimistic! 😄",1698677586,1698677586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You unlock all dlc content with this pc port of the game and along with it comes the experience that any Spider-man fan could've asked for. I've gotten to 100% the game quite easily and I'm sure you could do the same too. I find 100% a major addiction to accomplish with this game, the web swinging is fun and simple as well as the combat within the game yet it's always fun to mess around with. 

I personally prefer playing this game with a controller, a recommendation? definitely get a dualsense playstation 4 or 5 controller to feel great haptic feedback and vibration which helps the game fell more immersive as you play as spider-man.

The game is beginner friendly.

HOWEVER. What I dislike is how the game is displayed at full price, I heavily recommend getting the game when it is on sale rather than paying full price. Though that's just my opinion.

The story isn't too long but also isn't too short for the player. It took me around 28 hours to finish the game with 100% Dlc included.

The game offers a new game+ save which makes it where you can play/restart the game from the very beginning while keeping all of your progress. I have finished the game on spectacular difficulty which in my opinion wasn't so hard. After finishing the game you'll also have access to the hardest difficulty that game offers; Ultimate difficulty. Again, I don't find it difficult whatsoever and as I've mentioned before. This game was found very addicting to play to the point where you as the player may be wanting more.

A sequel for this game has been released already (Spider-man Miles Morales) and I can say the same for it, it isn't as long as this game but the web swinging and content is far more enjoyable in my opinion.

Best $65 Aud spent so far. Disclaimer; I got the game when it was on sale.

As a note, when there is a festive sale currently going on with steam, the Marvel spider-man games are usually on sale together.",1698677483,1698677483,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But stop:
1. Unskippable cut scenes. I'm trying to play a game. Also, the game is paused on focus lost, so you literally HAVE TO watch them, can't even alt tab. If that wasn't bad enough, some of them will have QTEs, so you can't even go get a coffee because it's very important for you to press space once a minute, when it shows up on screen. Seriously.
2. Making people play some random BS like Miles or Mary Jane. Like why. Do you believe anybody enjoys sneaking as Mary Jane, instead of zooming around the city as Spider-Man?

took me about 18 hours to complete main story campaign - and the storyline's pretty good with playable scenes from MJ & miles morales. (though i'm still deciding whether to get a copy of miles morales' ver).

but this game?
++ amazing graphics (fell in love w lots of scenes with close-up shots)
++ smooth gameplay (i'm on 165hz and it's smooth af.)
++ user-friendly game controls (i used controller and the moves are easy to master)
++ whatever the positive reviews that other players had left it here.

& for now, i'm hoping for spiderman 2 to be port in as well please :"")",1698600935,1698600935,True,1,0,0.50354611873626709,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I have put over 11 hours in the game so far and I have had zero issues with the game. The combat and fighting is top notch. The web slinging and zipping around as spooderman is the stuff of legend. Also when you get the dlc packs you can have Toby's and Andrews suit from previous films which is pretty sweet. 

My only complaint is when I have to play as MJ and sneak around thugs, it gets old tbh... but something I am able to look over.

Spider-Man Remastered has the perfect amount of story and is one of the first Steam games I've ever bought when it was released in August of last year. I would heavily recommend this to you If you have a decent PC to run it but if you don't I would recommend you maybe upgrade your PC or just play it at low settings with 10-50 FPS. This game was really fun and I had a great time playing it and there is also another game that my friend bought that was about Miles Morales spider man and I would also recommend that game if you can't get enough of the first.",1698547819,1698547819,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is good, the story too and just webbing around the city is so good.

My issues is the amount of times you repeat stuff. Same animations, same enemies, same quests...
I with the game was more bosses and fewer generic army or thugs against you.
Another issue to me was how many cut scenes there were. Every fight is a cut scene so lots of times I felt like I was watching the game and not actually playing it.

Once the game decides to take the diversity route and force you to play as Mary Jane and tokenized, Miles Morales for 30% of the story, the pacing slows to a crawl.  Also, the side game puzzles are boring as hell and most of the boss fights were pretty underwhelming.

But... when they let you play as OG Spider-Man, it's great.  Batman Arkham gameplay.

First off the graphics are some of the best on PC. I'm playing on 1440p ultra-wide with Ray tracing on and everything on high and getting a solid 60-80 FPS on my 3070. If you have a fancy RTX 30 or 40 series card, here is a title to show off what Ray tracing brings to a game. With the thousands of buildings and glass windows in this game, RT is utilized better than most games and I would say I prefer to run it on and lower frames than turning it off and getting 140+ frames. 

I also like the implementation of the PS5 haptic feedback on PC, something other Sony titles have refused to implement, even Destiny now owned by Sony refuses to do this... 

Combat and story are top notch and even better on PC with unlocked frames and Ultra-wide support with FOV sliders. I never played the DLC for Spider-man on PS4 and looking forward to beating them on PC and moving onto Spider-man 2. 

Overall I am glad I bought the game on sale and if you are like me and owned the old PS4 version and If you got the PC to run it, I would def buy for a nice remaster of one the best superhero games ever made.

However... there's an issue with some of the side objectives/challenges. Particularly the combat and stealth challenges. If you click Retry you will sometimes instantly crash. When this happens your Autosave is unusable and can't be loaded without crashing the game again. And with the game only having a single autosave slot, this is forcing you to go back to your previous Manual save. Potentially losing hours of gameplay.

So what started off as a game with fantastic flow of you going from mission to mission, challenge to challenge and running into the random crimes... has now screeched to a halt. In fear of once again losing a massive chunk of gameplay, I'm now stopping and manual saving before doing anything. And these constant breaks are no fun. 

Might change this review if I decide to go back to the game and continue. But after a couple times of this happening I'm putting this game down, at least for now.",1698359841,1698359931,False,6,1,0.551486074924468994,4,True,False,False

That game helped me through a rough time in my life in which I needed an escape to a world in which I got to embody the Web Head and do good. Buying this game I always assumed that this game would be, in every way better, but would still pale in comparison to Spider-Man 2 (2004) in my nostalgia addled brain. I'm exceedingly happy to say that's not the case.

[b] Combat: [/b] Borrowing heavily from the Batman: Arkham _____ series by Rocksteady, the combat flows beautifully in this game. It plays so much like those games that my first 3 or so hours with the game were infuriating. I tried to use the same button layout (not easily remappable in-game for those wondering) and found myself web zipping straight into a thug's fist for WAY too long. Once my brain reoriented and I met the game where it was willing to meet me...this combat sings in a fantastic way. Combos are more forgiving than in the Arkham games and you are much more acrobatic as Spidey which lends to fun air combos and gadgets really make an already stylish game feel dynamic in a whole new way. So in short: Arkham but still with it's own identity and heart.

[b] Open World: [/b] The map is (as is the style of the time) littered with side activities, collection missions, and activities to keep you engaged. A 100% run of the game will most likely take you somewhere in the neighborhood of 35-40 hours and very little of that feels like a grind. Web swinging around the city is absolutely fantastic helped by a good deal of animation and Spider-Man panache. Tools for traversing Manhattan in whatever way feels most fun to you are readily available from the start and only get better as you upgrade.

[b] Story: [/b] In one sentence, it's one of the most heartfelt and engaging spider stories I've ever experienced. Those with an eye for any form of the Spider-Man story will probably find something to love here. A criticism that I've seen is that the story is predicable.  I can understand where that comes from, and I will still say that I was taken aback by the way characters who we've been familiar with for decades will act in new and interesting ways that kept me hooked throughout. I was legitimately surprised by some of the twists that came...even if they were common sense happenings given other Spider-Stories throughout history. The story tugs at the heartstrings for me as well and I had a good number of ""I'm not crying, you're crying!"" moments.

[b] One GLARING Technical Issue: [/b] As of writing for those of us playing on PC, we get a new and exciting feature that I don't see Playstation players discussing: we get random crashes and save file corruption!! Over the number of hours that I've played the game, I've had about 40-50 crashes to desktop that left my save file un-loadable lest the crash happen as I was trying to auto-load. Thankfully, two things have mitigated the time loss that nearly drove me insane the first time this happened to me: 1) manually save ALL THE TIME and 2) A manual registry edit found in this YouTube video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRzwC-Tsdws&ab_channel=AMGameGoesOn I highly recommended that you manually save before doing any story mission or open world event, and in the event that you NEED to load your last auto-save, use the registry edit to load the crashing save. I've seen other saying that lowering graphics options helped them load otherwise crashing saves, but that did not work for me personally. 

[b] Wrap-Up: [/b] Aside from that one issue that I've learned to live with, this is the unquestionably best Spider-Man gaming experiences you can have. Seriously, this game is stupendously good. If you've got the cash to burn, and you have any love for super-hero, open world video games, this is a wonderful achievement in gaming. It deserves the accolades it has received wholeheartedly.",1698051267,1698178167,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Around 1 hour of play, the frame rate significantly drops and it becomes unbearable to play, even though my pc specs are above the recommended. I'm not the only one to experience this, and none of the fixes worked for me (I haven't tried the ps4 controller one, but I'm not spending the money just to make a test). Another issue is sometimes the game simply crashes in the loading screen. No error message, no warnings, just crashes. Overall, I believe it is a bad pc port problem.
