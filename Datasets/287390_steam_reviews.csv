While I think the first one was more horrific and darker than this sequel, this game manages to keep everyone on their feet with the continuation of Artyom's story with plot twists, redemptions, and a meaningful karma system. Listening to background conversations and 'various forms of entertainment' was pretty neat. I replayed the main story twice because I got the bad ending the first time, and I was motivated to retry to get the good ending. Playing a second time forced me to rethink my playstyle and the way I see things, and I was perfectly content with it. There are many ways of going around things and many outcomes. 

The best immersive playstyle is on hardcore ranger survival. That is the best and only playstyle, in my opinion. I also enjoyed the extra DLC missions such as the developer room, last stand, character, sniper, and simulation missions. I despise the spider mission for obvious reasons. There's a lot to do, and the game is easy to get all achievements for completionist runs.

My biggest issue with this whole series, that focuses so heavily on immersion, however, is the way they decided to indicate damage to the player, with the most obnoxious flashing red and heartbeat sound that would even follow you over into cutscenes if you had the misfortune of not finding a healthpack before entering one.

The graphics matched the redux-ed 2033, which are great for a game its age, but what it excels is utilizing these graphics and also the amazing environments its has to make some stunning visuals and vistas that are screenshot worthy.

The gameplay improved from the original 2033 game, but the redux 2033 had the gameplay elements added in the original last light to it, and this one stayed with that, and they were good and still are, consistent and easy to get used to across both games, yet very fun to play.

The story was actually great, with plot twists, and expansions to the lore, and exploring some morality type system as well. 
This game has choices without it being obvious, but every single thing you do in your play through is being remembered by an invisible to the player, morality points system. it can range based on kills you commit, or dont, to conversations you listen to, or dont, and many other things.

The main story is phenomenal, you have moral points and depending on your choices you get either a dark and depressing ending or a good and optimistic ending. So there is definitely replayability value and many weapons to choose from.
Theres a lot of DLC's, most of which add a new perspective to the main story, most of the dlcs are amazing, especially ""Kshatriya"".
Can't wait to play Exodus, althoug when I finish it, I'm gonna feel empty inside and sad.

This game's atmosphere paled in comparison to the original Metro 2033. It was similar to Dead Space 1 vs 2 in that the original had a horror feel while the sequel had an action combat feel. 

Unlike Dead Space 2, however, Last Light was simply boring to me. I think the issue was its too straightforward gameplay, especially with human enemies. 2033 balanced people and demon problems, and generally felt like you fought to survive. There was no reason to pursue the enemy and decimate them because it was not worth it. Last Light felt like fighting just because. I could kill everybody if I wanted to and still have extra ammo left over. I got tired of the constant stealth missions through bandit or soldier bases. Going to the surface had always been scary, so I enjoyed the brief moment where I had to go outside. Then I went back underground to the human-centric combat, which is where I stopped when I uninstalled. 

There were several combat sequences in Last Light that I think were intended to make you feel like you were in a pinch, but to me they didn't feel high stakes. For example, Last Light had a moment in which you defended yourself on a small raft while monsters flew out of the water at you. Sure you were fighting in close quarters, but that was about it. In 2033, there was a fight in which you were carrying a kid with one hand, stumbling in the dark with narrow field of vision as monsters darted out of holes and lunged at you. You relied on the kid on your shoulder to yell at you so that you could turn around and protect your back. And don't forget in 2033, there were engagements with a special monster that you could NOT afford to kill. Staring them down was the best -- and most unnerving -- option. Recalling those moments makes the pit of my stomach crawl. 

TL;DR Last Light felt like standard fps with some spooky designed enemies, but that wasn't enough to hold my attention.",1609996222,1706950047,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Last Light is waaay more interesting than the other imo; fights were more evenly balanced and the story was excellent.

The main story is phenomenal, you have moral points and depending on your choices you get either a dark and depressing ending or a good and optimistic ending. So there is definitely replayability value and many weapons to choose from. 
Theres a lot of DLC's, most of which add a new perspective to the main story, most of the dlcs are amazing, especially ""Kshatriya"". 

There are several glitches present: Sometimes when you are going down a ladder it feels as if you are frozen and moving pixel by pixel (could be an issue due to high frame rate?). Some weapon icons with mods bug and look broken (only the icon so its fine). Sometimes when you throw a molotov or a knife the hitboxes behave really weird and just go thru the enemy without hitting them... Sometimes you can literally get elevated really high up on vertical flat objects as if they are ramps. The frustrating part in the main game is that many times when you are trying to be fully stealthy and kill silently enemies, randomly other enemies have ultra sense and panic and scream for alarm (even though they didn't see or hear anything)

Now lets talk about the extremely painful parts: 
In the Developer pack in the Shooting range as well as Combat arena Challenge 8 but mainly 9/10 are extremely difficult. For several reasons. You are swarmed by enemies non stop, (heavy undead soldiers that take a lot LOT of bullets to die), you have fast monsters + a monster with a lot of health that uses it claws as a shield. The problem occurs that you have limited ammo so you need to be really accurate and try to use it wisely. The other problem is that all your weapons take a long time to reload, but you have no time to reload since enemies attack you EVERY SECOND. From the whole arena since they spawn in all directions you get shot all the time so your best bet is to stay edge map. But the next problem occurs, the AI soldiers literally throw grenades with EXTREME precision and most times you don't hear them from all the shooting you are doing non stop or even if you see it, you have barely anytime to react and run to a safe spot. When using the bolt action sniper you are literally frozen when loading every bullet, so the grenade always kills you.

The Tower pack: Its one of the HARDEST dlc's in any game i've played for several reasons. You fight enemies in large waves, you have a scarce weapon choice, with zero mods, you run out of ammo really quick and reload really slow, at some point you get attacked and slowed down while reloading and you die. You need to keep buying ammo supplies and in some levels buy back up soldiers to help you (which die easily if you don't help them). The enemy soldiers prefire you at all times even when you are behind cover. Its extremely extremely frustrating to finish. (but there is a glitch you could use to get the achievement easily).",1706571327,1706571327,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game takes us back to the world of metro, but now seeing more of the world above the metro and the consequences of our actions in the first game.

I love how the surface was crafted for this new game, now we can see even more of how destroyed moscow was left and through some visions in some of the mission how the world was before it and how some people saw the missiles hitting moscow. This game teaches us more about the world, its people and the way it is working now, now its time to redeem us for what we did in the first game in the way facing many foes and proving ourselves as true spartans.

I love how as well as the first game this game feels ALIVE, I really can't explain how even in more of one playthrough I found myself listening to conversations around the metro, listening to the little dark one and trying to imagine the world through his eyes, how every conversation with my fellow rangers felt like a conversation I was having with them even tho we're playing as a silent protagonist, this was meant to be like this and i gotta say the developers nailed it in this game. In their own words Artyom is the player and it really feels this way in the game.

I really feel like the true correct way to play these games is in the difficulty ranger hardcore, having to rationalice every bullet you have, waiting until you're in the blink of death to use a medkit and how it makes both you and the enemies glass cannons makes the experience even more inmersive, first play the game in normal mode to familiarize yourself with the controls and then do a whole new run with said difficulty, trust me is totally worth it.",1706445877,1706445877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As the protagonist you are conferred with the responsibility to take care of the last surviving member of your race against strange black humanoid  creatures that only you are not affected by.

Graphics: As mentioned above, there appears to almost be no repeating texture and it suits the gaming atmosphere of a future where humans live underground after a nuclear attack.

Sound: Music is almost non-existent. Instead, you are treated to a nice ambient sound that murmurs down the train tracks you must utilize. Sound is excellent.

All in all a good game but with a difficult ending to reach for the ""good"" ending. It requires multiple replays to get everything right and even then a good gaming guide.

Gameplay: Taking into account my review on METRO: 2033 it improves a lot, the enemy AI reacts to deadly injuries by taking cover to keep the shot in cover, the arsenal is also broader but eliminating the electric cannon but introducing long-range rifles and short range. During my game I actually noticed that the campaign is longer which I like and gives more motivation to search for things or see the things I have missed.

Achievements: Includes 49 campaign/weapon/map/DLC/Developer achievements, including the two endings.

Soundtracks: Incredible simply by saying that the main theme is very good, including its downloadable content and the theme of each side to give it a very good atmosphere.

Maps: The scenarios are incredible and very large to collect objects and develop strategies to eliminate enemies.

DLC: Includes about 7 DLCs which expand the story a little or others that are tests including the RPK which is a heavy automatic rifle.

NOTE: Before purchasing this product on Steam, I tried the XBOX One version and I must say that the PC version has problems with some animations that would be good to review for computer platforms.",1682390217,1705947138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oyun, her biri kendi atmosferine, zorluklarına ve sırlarına sahip olan doğrusal ve sanal alan seviyelerinin bir karışımını içerir. İster gizliliği, ister dövüşü, ister her ikisinin birleşimini tercih edin, oyun her duruma nasıl yaklaşacağınız konusunda size çok fazla özgürlük veriyor. Kaynakları temizlemenizi gerektiren bir üretim sistemi kullanarak silahlarınızı ve teçhizatınızı da özelleştirebilirsiniz.

Oyunun grafikleri gerçekçi dokular, gölgeler ve hava efektleriyle etkileyicidir. Oyun aynı zamanda ışıklandırma ve efektlere daha fazla gerçekçilik ve sürükleyicilik katan ışın izlemeyi de destekliyor. Oyun ayrıca sürükleyici ortam sesleri ve uygun bir film müziği ile harika bir ses tasarımına sahiptir. Bazı diyaloglar sevimsiz veya klişe olsa da seslendirme gayet iyi. Oyunun hikayesi ilgi çekici ve duygusaldır; seçimlerinize ve eylemlerinize bağlı olarak birden fazla sonu vardır. Oyunun aynı zamanda farklı modları, zorlukları ve keşfedilecek sırları ile çok sayıda tekrar değeri var. Oyun, nasıl oynadığınıza ve keşfettiğinize bağlı olarak yaklaşık 15-20 saat sürer.

Metro Last Light Redux, Metro serisinin hayranlarının yanı sıra iyi hazırlanmış ve atmosferik bir FPS oyunundan hoşlanan herkesin mutlaka oynaması gereken bir oyundur. Oyun, oynanış, görseller ve hikaye anlatımı açısından bir başyapıttır ve 9,5/10 gibi yüksek bir puanı hak ediyor.",1705753523,1705753523,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wanted to try metro games for years now and Just bought last light and went in without knowing anything besides seeing the trailer...

Well that was dissapointing to say the least.

The story is ok but not what I expected from an post apocalyptic game not  even close

The graphics are fine but the weapons and the general gameplay are pretty bad and its an 2013 FPS!!!!
Many bugs throught the campaign(Also it wouls be nice if the game had a tip or guidance system tthroughout the story so you don't have to run around a room and try to find where to press E,the same E that sometimes bugs and won't even appear)

Sounds:environment sound and dialogues are pretty much equally loud which makes it very frustrating.Besides the fact that the voice acting is plain lame, you will have 4 Npcs talking next to you while the subtitles show what your character says and still you wont be able to hear your characters words.Generally its a big headache in my opinion

I'll be playing Metro exodus in a little for the first time and I'm hoping It's as good or better than metro 2033/Last light.

Emerging from the irradiated ashes of nuclear war, Metro Last Light Redux rekindles the embers of the critically acclaimed 2013 original. In this definitive remaster, you don the gas mask of Artyom, a Ranger navigating the claustrophobic underbelly of post-apocalyptic Moscow – a labyrinth of Metro tunnels teeming with mutated horrors, hostile factions, and dwindling hope.

Redux polishes the already impressive visuals, transforming the dank tunnels and irradiated landscapes into breathtaking vistas of decay. Glimmering gaslight illuminates crumbling Soviet stations, while flickering neon paints a desperate beauty across overgrown ruins. Every crevice whispers of humanity's lost glory, while mutated monstrosities lurk in the shadows, their guttural growls a constant reminder of the fragile grip on survival.

The gunplay, while not revolutionary, feels weighty and satisfying. Each bullet precious, each trigger pull a gamble against dwindling resources. Stealth becomes a desperate dance, navigating chokepoints and scavenging for supplies, the ever-present gas mask your lifeline in the toxic air.

But Last Light is more than just a shooter; it's a masterclass in atmosphere. The haunting melodies of the soundtrack seep into your bones, while the guttural growls of mutants and the frantic chatter of survivors paint a vivid picture of a world teetering on the brink. Every decision resonates, each bullet fired carries weight, and the moral ambiguity of survival gnaws at your conscience.

Redux expands the narrative with the ""Ranger Hardcore"" mode, a punishing experience for veterans seeking an even greater challenge. This mode strips away HUD elements, limits supplies, and cranks up the difficulty, transforming Metro into a true survival horror experience.

However, Last Light isn't without its flaws. The story, while gripping, occasionally stumbles into melodrama, and the open-ended conclusion might leave some players wanting more. Certain sections feel a tad repetitive, and the AI, while improved, can still be occasionally wonky.

Despite these minor blemishes, Metro Last Light Redux remains a masterpiece of post-apocalyptic storytelling and immersive gameplay. Its masterful atmosphere, challenging combat, and morally complex narrative draw you into its desolate world and leave you long after the credits roll. Whether you're a seasoned Ranger or a curious newcomer, Metro Last Light Redux is a journey worth taking.

Verdict: 4.5 out of 5 irradiated rats. An atmospheric masterpiece with satisfying gunplay and a gripping story, despite minor narrative stumbles and occasional AI quirks. Redux polishes the gem that was the original, making it a must-play for fans of post-apocalyptic shooters and immersive storytelling.

Recommended for: Fans of atmospheric shooters, survival horror, and post-apocalyptic narratives.

Not recommended for: Players seeking fast-paced action or a lighthearted experience.

Metro: Last Light Redux is a sequel to Metro 2033 Redux, which is a remaster of Metro 2033, making this game a remaster of Metro: Last Light. As it's in its predecessor, you play as Artyom, now a Spartan ranger, traveling the metros of Moscow after WW3. Set in 2034, this game is a tale of adventure, betrayal, greed, acceptance, redemption and a weird type of love. Based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro 2034, Artyom must atone his past mistakes of striking the unforeseen enemies of the prequel who were actually an ally to him. If you've played 2033 Redux, this game is definitely similar to it. The graphics, ambiance, weapon customizations are practically alike. They added new characters that are important to the plot, a few amazing weapons, we got more areas to explore both in the metro and on the surface, such as the Kremlin, the Red Square, plague-infested Oktyabrskaya Station and the aforementioned flooded station of Venice. Not even that, you also get new content in the form of more short levels, a developer pack and a wave-based mode. My God, I hate the Tower, but I do love Kshatriya. As with 2033 Redux, this game has its fair share of bugs such as the elevator, where the character just jump out to the ceiling and a few NPC bugs. But the worst offender so far is the sudden crashes of the game. I am sick of it, my game crashed more than ten times. I don't know what's causing it, because when you click Continue after the first crash, the game will crash again. The solution I took is to go to Chapters, then to your current mission. Yeah it sucks to replay the mission, even worse if you're doing Ranger Hardcore, hence I would not be doing RH for this game. In the end, even with its bugs, I would recommend Metro: Last Light Redux, I find it to be a great sequel to 2033 and a great addition to the franchise as a whole. This game regularly goes on sale, bundled with the trilogy, so getting the bundle is basically a no-brainer.",1704211942,1704211998,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

What I like about this game is that it adds more depth to the other factions. In 2033 it felt like it was more ""commies bad"" or ""nazis bad"", but here we get a better understanding of what's going on in every faction. There are also more weapons to choose from and more customizations. The scariest areas in this game are also scarier than the scariest areas in 2033.

What I don't like about this game is that it's too hollywood-esque. In 2033 it feels like every station was just managing to get by, but slowly approaching an independing doom. This game lacked any real sense of existential dread which I think is a subject that's closely tied to this franchise.

Some areas were more frustrating than fun and felt like they encouraged you to just rush through them. Every enemy encounter with a monster felt more like a waste of bullets than a threat that you needed to get rid of if you want to survive. At least human enemies drop bullets and can be stealth killed. Better just hope that it's the right kind.

The most unfun areas were the swamp/water levels where it wasn't always clear where you can walk or not because there's often tall grass or bushes blocking your sight. Some of the enemies in those levels also felt like bullet sponges, but it might be that my aim is bad or that I don't know what their weak spots are.

I really didn't like Anna and it felt like the relationship between her and Artyom was completely pointless. There were however good characters, both major and minor which had just the right amount of focus put on them. Pavel is arguably the best written character in the game. I won't spoil why.

The canon ending feels unreasonably difficult to get, but it doesn't mean that the non-canon ending is bad. I just feel that canon endings should be the easiest to get and alternative endings should require some more effort.

I'm not sure if I'd encourage you to play this on RH survival, at least the first time if you're considering playing it more than once, since ammo feels a lot more scarce in this game than in the previous one. It's not exactly impossible to do it, but running around and waiting for whatever timed objective to complete isn't exactly my idea of fun.

If you liked 2033, then get this game. The gameplay loop is just about the same, at least in the redux versions which are the only ones available for purchase at the steam store rn. If you haven't already played 2033, play that first and consider buying the bundle on sale. As I'm writing this, it costs less than 10€ on sale so it won't put you in lifelong debt unlike if you'd buy whatever poorly made safe bloatware AAA game with awful optimization that your average big game company decided to publish this month with mandatory DLC worth 10 times the price of the game itself on launch day.",1703987157,1703987157,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Metro Last Light is a linear story driven horror survival FPS with multiple endings, It has great graphics and some very tense gameplay, Customize your weapons and save the Metro from itself.

Story & Characters 9/10
The Story follows the adventures of Metro 2033, It is also based on a novel with the same name, People are still in the metro because of the invisible threat above ground. You play as the same protagonist from 2033, Artyom, Not much has changed, except for the shift of focus of enemies. I feel the mutants are less considered threats here, Surely you still need to kill them if they attack you, But in the last game they felt like the enemy, And here I feel other humans are the real enemy. The game like 2033 has multiple endings, So maybe that was just the impression the game gave me by the choices I made.

In the last game I did not feel any of the characters stood out or where particularly memorable but I do feel they improved on the NPC characters this time, there was more bonding and faces started to get familiar. Saying I care about their wellbeing is a bit over an overstatement, But it surely improved a lot and I was curious towards them to say the least. The rest of the game felt really similar to the last installment, But that is not a bad thing.

Gamemodes & Gameplay 8/10
There is no multiplayer at all, It is all single player, Mainly the story mode, There are some extra missions which are pretty cool, Chapter select is still there But you can not go back trough normal progress, It is a very linear game, You are rewarded for exploring but any door could close shut behind you. Your choices do matter and in my experience it is rather hard getting the good ending.

Like the previous game you can choose between Survival or Spartan for your run, Spartan is more head on with easier enemies and more ammo while Survival is a more sneaky way of playing where it is better to evade enemies. Then there is Ranger mode which makes the game a lot more realistic in terms of difficulity, 2 bullets will be the end, But enemies go down a lot easier too, If you really want a Survival experience I would recommend going with that. I played the game on Survival, But I went trough it as a Spartan, and I had tons of ammo to spare mostly.

The main story is a shooter with a very tense Horror like atmosphere, There are some parts you have to follow people around or stuff like that, but it did not feel like a chore at any point. There are also a lot of different ""New Missions"" these are like extra missions you can play and some are pretty cool, There are sniper missions but also wave missions, all kinds of cool stuff that you will enjoy if you like FPS games.

Graphics & Soundtrack 9/10
Like Metro 2033 The game looks beautiful, surely it is all Dark and Grimey, But it creates an incredibly tense atmosphere, The sounds really enhance this feeling. The pre rendered movies look horrible, They have very bad graphics and play in 30fps. It is like it was pre rendered using a microwave. Next to that everything looks great, especially considering the age of the game. I also love the design for some of the weapons, Like the Shotgun Revolver, Who thinks of insane weapons like that.

Performance & Support 7/10
The game runs really well, absolutely no crashes, glitches or bad behavior like that. Like Metro 2033 It does have some issues with Vsync, It works, but not always, Other times you can't turn it off, It is a bit strange, But it is not a huge issue, It also has bad mapping with the default kernel driver using an Xbox One controller, It works fine with Xpadneo, so if you play with a controller, use xpadneo.

Endgame & Replayability 8/10
I am a little dissapointed with the endgame, Like Metro 2033, The game is extremely linear, It is very easy to miss things. There is a chapter select, But it will overwrite your last savegame and you can not go back and clean up the achievements. The replayability is okay, Since it has multiple endings and multiple ways to play. There are also a lot of achievements that are easily missable, If you want to perfect the game it will certainly take you a while.

Conclusion 8/10
Overall, The game is very similar to Metro 2033, At least I see very few differences between the 2 Redux versions, So this review might sound very similar to the review of 2033. Just like that game it surely is a great game worth picking up, And a must have if you like anything related to FPS or Horror. It is a short but thrilling ride a very linear ride but how you ride it is completely up to you, Kill or Sneak. Good or Bad.",1703748762,1703748762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nuclear warfare destroyed surface civilization, so now experienced Spartan Artym locates the alleged last intelligent surface dwelling creature called the Dark One... a alien like mutant who possesses telepathic and detection abilities. Before a formal acquaintanceship can unfurl, Artym gets detained by ""those  from WWII who must not be named"". The Dark One gets sold off for 200+ ammunition, the accepted currency of the world. Artym escapes prison with a communist comrade, narrowly escaping the chamber of flatulence, then being imprisoned yet again...by fellow comrade. He escapes to finally egress, only to yet again get separated by a traitor mentioned from casual conversation from the prologue. Yada yada...blah blah.

Bippity boppity boo. You find the Dark One, unveil a conspiracy, and stop the true madman behind the suffering. Do you live happily ever after? Depends on some superficial choices you make throughout the game. Ready?

Endings?
Good Ending:
Listen to people talk, especially if they are suffering. Donate for charity. Never execute and sneak around. If opponents surrender, knock em out with [X = Xbox Controller]. Spare unarmed personnel. Show mercy to most despicable people, only act in self defense. Find a missing Teddy Bear. Assist Comrades in dire situations. Free prisoners, etc.

Bad Ending:
Become Grim Reaper. Spare nobody. Pillage everything. Execute all traitors. Neglect pleading comrades. Be cold and heartless. That's how the Bad Ending is achieved.

Verdict:
Alright game, but stagnant pace due to limitations of NPC script-reading blocking essential passage ways. Prologue drawn out. Game is very much like Call of Duty. Sniper DLC forces you to not take down all targets, enemies prematurely scream ""Alert!"" when knifed (throw or melee). Tower DLC far out the worst. Difficulty greatly increased on 3rd simulation, useless NPC assistance become 30 second bullet fodder. Overall, an average experience .

but whole world looks beautiful and game atmosphere is pretty good. I had fun enjoyed it  got the original version for free but bought  the bundle because i really enjoyed this game played this game 5 times probably play few more times in future. i didn't really hate that game was linear i liked it. The difficulty in game is kinda easy on second time on hardcore didn't felt like a challenge at times.
also few spoilers below :






The metro city or place this game have is so so fucking good man like i really wish i could interact more with shops and people in those cities .

The DLCs or missions are interesting some are you play like this other character and some are like kinda cool
the coolest being the Kshatriya and second good one was Spider Lair and Third Pavel just because of one single thing you can do which made me really want to play whole games as Pavel. The worst one is Tower pack doesn't really have much of story you kill and yeah, Developer mission is way more better the level one is actually level one and you are free to do anything make things kill make yourself against alot of things and museum so you can get good look at what you were scared of, with complimentary  funny, creepy janitor.
 
Game had some naked lady scene which u cant skip, 

Also the deep silver the company that published this game sued a fan made game ""Paradox of hope"" not anymore on steam it had a lot of stuff same as metro but in vr but imo they didn't deserved getting sued for something like that.
This games is kind of similar to stalker the whole art time is from stalker team and they were accused of ripping of stalker.
Anna are Artyom are called partners and they only worked together only in beginning of the game .
We spent more time with Pavel then Anna,
I would rather get down with Pavel then have kid with Metro LL Anna.

The cannon ending or the ending they go with on third game is fine but i finished my first play through with ""Bad-Ending"", so for me Bad Ending is the real ending , it felt right considering what we did with dark ones on 2033.
And final thing about story i was confused was the Mutants or Creatures from surface, Moscow was destroyed when Artyom was a child and he sounds quite young probably like 19-25 so did these creatures existed before destruction of Moscow if not , Did mutation hot them so hard they turned into this this quick
I don't know much about Metro Background story maybe i missed some dialogue maybe they will tell us more about them in third game or on Books.

Good game didn't regret buying it

it's most similar to wolfenstein TNO

pacing is all over the place
ammo economy is aids, there are sections where you expend thousands of bullets and others when you have three airgun pellets for a boss fight, of course ammo stacks to a measly 40 shotgun rounds so especially in mutant areas you need to camp choke holds with fire grenades or you expend so many bullets its just hopeless, it doesn't really matter that you collected bullets from previous areaas

on the otherhand easily the best parts is clearing out entire bases of reds or nazis, the stealth system can do with improvements but the enemies don't really have goldfish memory like other stealth games and you are not really meant to be able to stealth kill every enemy so it makes the goal more about getting through them rather than mass murder
going guns blazing is also fun, but every enemy has a headlamp for some reason and is braindead easy to headshot

this game had a lot more bosses, and were easily some of the worst sections of the game, i had to search up guides on 3/4 bossfights because especially on ranger mode nothing is explained, you get the rhino to run into the enviroment, and the first time it triggers a scripted section so you assume it will next time but no, the rhino is still alive little do you know it's at 1 hp but you don't want to waste ammo, almost every boss is like that or on the red bossfight extremely annoying as the dude juts out of cover in a milisecond and takes 3/4ths of your health out

you can't pick your ending instead its off a 'karmic system'
this leads to multihour runs where you do every good option, spare every d!ck head but because you didn't listen to enough convos or killed too many of the enemies (god forbid you kill people committing genocide) you will still get the bad ending

the story is very repetitive and predictable, almost every cut scene to fight story characters is initiated by opening a door in the most obvious area",1703438129,1703439333,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

The combat against the human enemies is quite nice actually. One of the better AI experiences you'll have in a shooter.

Cons: the character models seem off to me. All of them have really bugged out eyes.
Sound effects, much like the first game, are very bad. The guns sound like toys and that is a huge turn off.
The character movement is far too slow so fights against monsters are incredibly annoying.
Your character can't carry much ammo at all. This makes fights with humans very annoying because it always seems like you have barely any ammo and the enemies have infinite ammo. I get that they want it to feel like a survival experience but it should still balance out to where enemies have to watch out for their ammo as well, 
geez.
EDIT: forgot to mention this con. The performance is fine in terms of FPS as I had a solid 60fps at all times. However, there is a very annoying micro-stutter issue. It isn't consistent but mostly affects the animations and I see it sometimes when turning horizontally.

Overall, much like the first game, I tried it multiple times and just can't get hooked into it at all.

Still written well, the bad ending leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, and the good ending just feels TOO good to be true. 

I have come across a few bugs regarding the new boss fight idea this game tries to bring in, with the Big guys often getting stuck or clipping into unreachable areas. Like behind closed walls, rocks, solid barriers, so on. BUT after you restart the game you should be able to fight them normally.

I should also say that this the first Metro game to actually get a good scare out of me, there are a few scenes that make you feel watched, anxious. AND I'M HERE FOR IT. 

i'm not rating this thing because i have nothing creative to say.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I played on hardest difficulty and there were times with mutant encounters that it wasn't fun as much as frustrating. The story of this one is much more packed and can be a drag at some points. Specifically when it came to the ""magical"" and station politics.
The first 3-4 hours where you are with Pavel then past that is good until it gets muddied down by the aforementioned politics. The story is kinda all over the place in this one compared to the very simple 2033.
It was better in the human combat and of course Anna is a W. Overall I enjoyed the first game more but this one is still very worth the time even with its story issues.",1702802208,1702802208,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the story, the atmosphere, the tension, it's there in full in all 3 games and I am glad to own all of them.

There's always just one path forwards with the only choice being an awkward sneak route or the usually more efficient plow straight through route (the AI is great at walking right into shooting galleries one after another). You just keep getting dragged from one bad situation to the next even when its obviously walking into traps or ambushes or bridges that will clearly break, and the game relies heavily on screwing you over in mini cut scenes to advance the plot. I learned to dread opening doors because its usually a mini animation that jams you up until you have walked through it and EXTREMELY frequently sets you up to be screwed over on the other side.

If someone bothered to make a true open world RPG (think fallout 4) out of this it would be spectacular. Otherwise its VERY much just a console game on a PC.

Enhanced and refined, Last Light Redux builds upon the strengths of its predecessor, delivering an engaging narrative, improved visuals, and refined gameplay mechanics.

From the outset, Last Light Redux seamlessly continues the dark and compelling storytelling established in Metro 2033 Redux. The narrative picks up where the previous game left off, exploring the consequences of the protagonist's actions and delving deeper into the complexities of the post-apocalyptic world. Characters are well-crafted, adding emotional depth to the overarching narrative.

Graphically, Last Light Redux maintains the series' commitment to creating a visually stunning environment. The enhanced visuals capture the haunting beauty of the post-apocalyptic Moscow Metro, with attention to detail in both the environments and character designs. While it may not showcase the pinnacle of 2023 graphics, the game's visuals effectively convey the atmospheric and grim setting.

A distinctive feature of Last Light Redux is the introduction of propaganda, especially those that negatively portray the Reds, one of the most important factions in the game. This propaganda serves as a tool to shape public perception in the game world. The negative portrayal of the Reds adds a layer of political intrigue that affects the player's understanding of the factions and contributes to the moral ambiguity of the story.

The propaganda against the Reds is not just a thematic background; it actively influences the game experience. Players are faced with situations where trust is scarce, alliances are fragile and decisions must be made in a morally complex environment. That doesn't mean you necessarily have to showcase them as heroes, but what is shown in the game, which is also the main story, crosses all reasonable and unreasonable boundaries. I just think it's something that I should warn you about before you buy the game.

Last Light Redux maintains the series' signature blend of first-person shooter action and survival horror elements. Ammunition remains scarce, and players must navigate the challenges of a world torn apart by conflict. The addition of new gameplay mechanics keeps the experience fresh, and moral choices continue to play a significant role in shaping the outcome of the story.

In conclusion, Metro Last Light Redux successfully builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. The game offers a captivating narrative, enhanced visuals, and engaging gameplay, all set against the backdrop of a world shaped by propaganda and political intrigue. The negative portrayal of the Reds adds complexity to the story, making Last Light Redux a compelling experience for fans of the series.",1702178940,1702178940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Took me 8-9 hrs to finish the game. Same advice to my previous review on Metro 2033.
It will be longer if you take your time and interact with your surroundings. My first playthrough took 8-9 hrs main storyline.

The story is ALSO REALLY GOOD AND THE GAMEPLAY. I prefer this than Metro 2033 but they are close to eachother really! Both games have good story and gameplay. But of course this is better for me because there's more features like extra missions, more guns, etc. 

I bought the whole Metro saga for 90% off because of VR Fest 2023. THIS IS WORTH IT. But even more worth it with sales like 50% or above duh.

This one was, for me, a survival & adventure game. I got my hands on it because of a sale and my appreciation of steam's way of organizing my games and sharing game experiences with friends.  

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510888810

I played this game and my husband got to witness me play, hear the game, see the chaos and cinematics. Once he had a copy, we sat side by side and had our own adventures (we had to use earbuds and headphones or the sounds would overlap). 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510884034

He became as hooked as I was. lol
It became a memorable experience for us both. I do recommend this game for females and males who like this type of game. The release date may not be all that fresh, but the game play is still amazing. 

This one stood out for both, my husband and I, of all of the Metros.

My PC isn't very good so I can't run Exodus, but the first two games were fine (a bit laggy in some levels for last light, especially when firing weapons). Last light is a bit annoying with its moral points I find. Been trying to get the good ending (which is also the cannon ending) for years. Currently following a walkthrough for all the moral points to get the redemption. But man its hard. Im not talking just don't kill the guards to be a good boy ''hard''. I'm talking ''did you eat your fucking brocoli'' hard. Some of these moral points are almost impossible to get unless you know about them. Its become sort of a running gag in my friend group where we call each other out on the most random actions and say: oh look out, you won't get the good ending (for trivial shit like eating your pizza the right way). Besides that, great game, great series! ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND. The characters, the story, the gameplay is so good. Have fun every time I play it. Just listening to random bs conversations from some of the guards I'm meant to mercissely kill later is absolutely GOLDEN dialogue. The metro series, I find, really dive into the human aspect of the apocalypse and how fucked up it can be for people. Kind of like the walking dead before it went to shit. Even Artyom, despite never hearing him talk to npcs, is so interesting through the various journal entries as well as his thoughts at the beginning of every level. Even if your not interested on completing achievements, I absolutely recomend you get the achievement for collecting all the diary entries from Artyom. For the simple reason that they are all interesting and fun read, and you really get to dive into the psyche of the character you are playing. In the end he is just a normal dude, trying to understand himself and the world around him. He gets praised by everyone for his exploits, yet stays humble and you can see he's just trying to figure out how to do the right thing in a world where that isn't really obvious anymore. Sorry for my rambling, but if your second guessing getting the metro series, I hope this review helps you make your decision and get this game. ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT 100%.

 good things: story is decent imo
 bad things: all the npcs sound the same and they dont even look human or even blink. they just stare into your soul.
ladders are buggy af. you can go up them but you half the time you go up slowly.
some of the levels are buggy. im not sure if this happens to everyone but when i got the venice level i was teleported to space and after the dance (i think we all know what dance im talking about) i couldnt even leave the bar and one of the npcs was stuck in the walking animation.

This is more of a review for Metro Last Light Complete Edition, but it kinda works for Redux too.
The journey to get 100% achievement was a bit tedious, but seeing the 'Redemption' ending, and 'Shadow Ranger' achievement pop up really made me let out a sigh of relief. I tried to get Shadow Ranger in Ranger Hardcore but The Chase and the fight against Pavel was difficult to do Pacifist, so I had to do 3 runs total.
Complete Edition (CE) has a bit more achievements and several of them are differet from Redux. One of them is already mentioned above: Shadow Ranger. One achievement that is changed is the 'Developer' achievement which got increased from 1 hour in Redux to 3 hours in CE. I finished the range and arena in about 1 hour, but I didn't know that you have to spend 3 hours in the level in ONE SITTING. So, I stared at the wall of the museum for 3 hours while I do something else. It is a stupid change, in my opinion. 3 hours is too long, but I doubt saying will change anything. This is an old game.

Some take place in different parts of the Metro universe but are separated from the main story and characters and tell a whole new story and let you have a different experience.

[*] Great story

[*] Great characters

[*] Holds up extremely well gameplay & graphics wise       

     after so many years.

[*] Love the gunplay

[*] Lots of difficulty modes

[*] Extra tidbits scattered throughout the chapters, but        not an overwhelmingly large amount of them for 100%ers

[*] Sound engine is very good

[h1] CONS [/h1]

[*] If you stop going up the ladder, you become very slow.

[*] Can run game at 140fps+ but cutscenes locked to 30 (To be expected but still annoying).

[*] I find the redux version made faces looks waxy, glossy, and not human. More mannequin looking.

[*] Maps can be very repetitive in nature and look the the same. Even more the case if you've played metro 2033 (Not a huge minus for me but still one regardless)

[*] Subjective: I fucking hate khan. Annoying hippie

Artyom will automatically switch filters when one runs out completely. The only reason to switch manually is if you hate listening to choking noises / if you suspect hostiles are nearby and don't need the distraction.

You will find a LOT of upgraded weapons during gameplay, and you should only upgrade the ones you really, really like.

The ""Bandits"" chapter is the only one with both a merchant and enemies to fight - this means that if you're patient, you can earn a ton of extra money by swapping your weapons with the ones your enemies were carrying, backtracking to the beginning, selling them, then repeating. It can take awhile, but it's worth it - on non-Ranger modes each gun can sell for 100+, which should leave you with more than enough bullets to last you the rest of the game.

There are two big difficulty spikes in the game, and they both involve defending your position while waiting for something to arrive. Don't worry if you are getting killed all the time, the difficulty evens out after those parts.

Don't underestimate the Nosalis. They got a pretty huge buff from 2033.

Wait for the last ten/twenty seconds of air before swapping filters.

The Throwing Knives are incredibly overpowered, and you can retrieve them.

Ranger Mode is not necessary, the difficulty levels are properly balanced. It's not like 2033 where Easy made everything a bullet sponge.

If you are using an AMD card, turn off PhysX which is enabled by default. Your framerate will thank you.

The Kshatriya mission in the ""Factions"" DLC is the closest we have to S.T.A.L.K.E.R in the Metro engine for now. It's really good.

You get ""morality points"" towards the good ending by exploring (and looting) out of the way spots, listening to incidental conversations all the way through (civilians and enemies both), doing good deeds and avoiding enemy casualties. If you explore well enough, you can skip the pacifist angle and still get the good ending though.

Don't worry about getting separated from your allies. They will always wait for you to finish exploring, safe and sound.

Many stealth sections are based around advancing as far as you can without being detected to trigger a conversation that will make the enemies move on to more convenient spots.

With the exception of ""Nightfall"", none of the boss fights are about pointing a gun at the bad guy and pulling the trigger for a while. There's always an environmental hazard / vulnerable spot to target.",1699867827,1699867827,True,2,0,0.534883737564086914,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
1) You got SNIPER in this version of the game !!!

3) MOAR SPOOOOOOODERS Nest to Be PURGE !!! Burn em all 
4) From stabbing Spoodders, Burning Nest, Punching enemy , killing Shrimps, gameplay is awesome and fun
5) Also Few Extra Short Story Mission, love it ( Also you don't need to worried about Progression Loss on Main Story when you wanna do something new )
6) Tips for the annoying tower pack... i guess ( i have to do this, because somehow, too much enemies spawn will freeze the game for me, just hold ""G"" to take off your mask, then boom, you beat the level, do that... 4 time i guess.


Cons: 
1) Welp...this can be depend on One's Likeness, I don't really like to play Stealth, I mean, I do love scorring headshot on Enemy, but game kidda force you to Play Stealth in the first few chapters, so if you are Bad at Sneaking...you might loose interest on kept playing more

Metro: Last Light is a story-driven post-apocalyptic experience, with a lot of emphasis on environments, and world design. The game follows Artyom, who races against the clock to save his people, the rangers, from an enemy clan, the Reds, who plan to take over a certain part of ranger territory, called the D6. His journey involves a lot of out-of-this-world experiences, for better or for worse.

[h1] Gameplay/Gunplay [/h1]

Last light's gunplay, to put it briefly, is tight. The guns' recoil is heavy enough to frustrate the player, but forgiving enough to feel fun and exhilarating if the player successfully counters it. The hitboxes are accurate, and the enemies are smart enough when IN COMBAT. However, they are not as challenging when they are not on alert, and sometimes end up being blind as bats. That's a huge turn-off in my opinion. 
The various gameplay elements, (ones not directly part of the combat) gel together perfectly. The intermittent filter replacements (sometimes in the middle of a full-blown firefight), the wiping of the gas mask to get a clearer view, and even the last ditch med-kit usage when you are literally seconds away from death are perfectly implemented mechanics. Deciding when to hit T to swap filters and become vulnerable in the middle of combat, or debating on whether to reload your auto-shotgun, or switch to a revolver while you are being swarmed by watchmen, or thinking about whether to go out of your way for some extra resources, knowing that there's a danger at every corner, will ALWAYS be thrilling.

[h1] The World/Lore [/h1]

The world design and environment are probably the strongest suits of LL. The overgrowth taking over the roads on the surface, or the worn walls of the tunnels, Metro's environments never failed to amaze me. I would take minutes just to look around during the surface levels, with the moisture from my mask distorting my view ever so slightly. The amount of Dishonored vibes it gives me is unreal.
Even walking around in the levels feels immersive. People trying to get accustomed to life under the ground is very interesting. I remember coming across a small play of sorts, carried out using hand shadows, where - upon seeing a dog-shadow on the screen - one of the kids said ""Show us something WE know!"" It's moments like these that make LL special. A man trying to get to a woman to give her a shot of insulin, only to be stopped by a guard because the woman was infected with a virus, or a bunch of watchmen teaming up on a mama bear who was merely trying to protect her cubs, and completely ignoring the player for the entire duration. These are the moments that show the true state of Metro, where desperate measures are no longer ""desperate"", they are just a way of life.

[h1] The visuals [/h1]

The game has to have some of the most realistic and cleanest graphics I've seen in my life. I don't know what sort of drugs the 4A engine was on, but does it look beautiful. The lighting is just on-point. The detail on the textures, and the ambient occlusion worked wonders, thanks to how many closed and narrow spaces there are in the game. The volumetric lighting was absolutely *PRIS—fucking—TINE*. The first time I saw fog, enveloping Artyom, and shifting around, I was just sitting there, awestruck, thinking about how old this game is.

[h1] The story and VA [/h1]

The story was absolutely amazing, I don't even have words. The narrative was delivered very well by the NPCs. I would be lying if I said that I absolutely loved all the characters, but this isn't the game's fault. The circumstances force Artyom into a lot of situations where he has to be the lone wolf, and as an indirect result of that, character development isn't really a strong suit of the game. That being said, I really enjoyed Pavel and Anna's VAs. Pavel going ""Yo-moyo"" at every random moment always gave me a good chuckle. [spoiler] The moment I realized I was betrayed by Pavel, I fkn lost it. I couldn't believe I let his ""tak-tak-tak"" get the better of my judgment, and think he was an ally. [/spoiler] Anna's VA felt somewhat stiff at times, when compared to Pavel, but she was certainly better than the other NPCs. However, her and Artyom's relationship was rather... rushed, in my opinion. [spoiler] I can understand that they [i]thought[/i] they were going to die, and that's why they opened up to each other, but there should have been a little more development in their relationship, at least after the quarantine sequence of the game. It happened all too quickly. [/spoiler]

[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]

If one looks at Last Light as a GAME (i.e. gameplay), it is perfect. Period. Amazing gameplay, jaw-dropping visuals, a terrific story, and characters who feel like they belong in the world and have seen a lot of what it has to offer: these things make this a must-play title in my honest opinion. The way it took advantage of my claustrophobia was amazing. Never in my life did a SINGLE entry (be it a movie, a game, or a book) make me excited for the ENTIRE franchise. Until Metro did.

In this game you go outside of the metro station more often, it still manages to have the amazing atmosphere and immersion that Metro 2033 Redux had. The story is really good, and the characters are interesting. It isn't the exact same as its predecessor, the missions have new stuff in them and there are quite a bit more weapons. Overall it is more combat heavy than 2033, but not too much and it still manages to be amazingly terrifying at some parts.

I played the game on normal / spartan (spartan was recommended by the game; in 2033, survival was recommended) and as expected the game was really easy, but that didn't really take away from the experience I think.

Graphically it is really good and the performance is also good. It is more of a set piece game than 2033 with bigger fights and great world design, some parts of the game looked very good for how old the game is.

If you liked 2033, you will definitely like this and in general I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested (definitely play 2033 first, the story will make more sense even though it can definitely be ok as a standalone game).",1699651433,1699651433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

⚖️ iMeter {A} Worth a play, if you enjoy Combat in Post-Apocalyptic World, & make friend with Alien. However, if you're looking for Realistic Stealth Play, don't play it

[h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]
* Year 2013: Game released 
* A few months later: Started playtest for the first time
* 8 hours later: Fun game, but don't know why I don't like it
* Year 2014: Delist when Redux version released
* Year 2023: 4A Games celebrates the 10th anniversary, giving free copy!
* 2 hours later: Gameplay is only fun when hunting for achievements
* 4 hours later: Frustrated with outdated guide
* 32 hours later: Finish created a new guide for easy checking
* 36 hours later: Purchased Redux version in order to release a review
* 0.5 hour later: Start all over again in Redux

[h1]  🔊         TESTER MUST KNOW:[/h1]
* Redux version included all DLC just like Metro LL Complete Edition
* Adjust accurate physic by turn off adv physx & Tessellation set to normal
* Game world timeline: Year 2034 after the Metro 2033 event
* Watchmen = Crawling monster
* Charge battery by holding ""F"" key and mouse left click
* Change to special ammo by holding ""R"" key 
* Special bullets can be use as ""Cash"" for shopping
* Gas Mask must replace a new one before it break (must know where to find it)
* Diary collection progress is viewable during replay old chapter

[h1] 💎        SAME GENRE COMPARISON:[/h1]
* Immersive wind effects
* Stealth play is very faking (easy)
* Have option to refuse play stealth
* Maximum limit to carry 3 gun
* Not all monster encounter is harmful in the journey
* Regular spiders appear cause goose-bump
* Jump scares

[h1]  ⚠️        RUMOR CHECKING:[/h1]
* A near-perfect sequel to Metro 2033 ➜ Agree
* Too short ➜ Short but fun enough, and try not to speed run
* Bad enemies A.I. ➜ Means they pretend not seeing player in stealth play

It is just that, a first person shooter, which would be fine at a modern standard but because this game is so apparently old, I wouldn't say it is worth it. Not at full price anyway. There are plenty of other FPS games out there that will give you a much better experience.

If you haven't played Metro 2033, I'd start there as this game picks up from the ""bad"" ending of that game. I'd recommend you play at least on hardcore for the added immersion.

Like the last game there are two ending you can get, depending on your choices and how you play the game. Listening to conversations, exploring the environment, and not senselessly killing everyone in your path will help you get the better outcome.

Also, in later stages of the game there's a bug that prevents you from being able to knock people out for the rest of the game. In my case it was the Bandits level, and replaying the previous two levels (one of which was purely dialog) fixed it. I also deleted the autosave and the save for the Bandits level (Documents > 4A Games > Metro Last Light) per the suggestions of one steam thread, not sure if it's strictly necessary but it worked for me. Be sure to disable steam cloud saves until you launch the game at least once if you delete the recent saves.

Overall, I'd highly recommend.

I just didn't feel the story. The dark ones attacked human settlements, ""our"" settlement, killing so many. Destroying them was the right move and I have no remorse having done so. But this game and Khan just want me to believe otherwise. Too late for that though.

Gameplay wise this game is worse than 2033. There is shooting, lots of it! Thats it. Kill the nazis kill the reds, kill the fish, kill some random dudes, kill fucking boss monsters. It gets tiresome. Metro 2033 and exodus always had some break inbetween scenes of high tension. This game did not. Also I did not feel any fear just frustration killing bullet sponges.",1698772870,1698954113,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

An absolutely fantastic game in every way. This game captures the eerie and psychological nature of life in the Moscow metro - after nuclear bombs fall in an alternate timeline, wiping most of humankind from Earth - in a brilliant way.

Everything about Metro: Last Light is near perfect. The story is so well thought out. Last Light takes place after the events following what took place at the end of the first game, Metro 2033. Once again you are Artyom. Consumed by the guilt of having wiped out the Dark Ones towards the end of Metro 2033, you are now on an urgent mission to try and stop the last remaining 100,000+ inhabitants of the Moscow metro from wiping each other out in an all out final war. You do this with the help of one of the Dark Ones who managed to survive being wiped out following the events of the first game.

Levels are breathtakingly beautiful. I love how the game crafts such a sinister atmosphere both underground and on the surface. It's not the mutants alone that add to the uncanny atmosphere while you make your way through the metro; the lights and ambiance play a major role in creating that feeling as well. The mutants on their own wouldn't really be that scary as they are simply a product of a new world after the atom bombs fell.

Metro: Last Light is an absolute masterpiece. A rare gem in a time where games are filled with boring repetitive missions and poorly thought-out storylines.

I love the DLC missions too, especially Kshatriya - they should make a standalone Metro game where you have a massive map in which you are a ranger who is tasked with going through the level and you have to collect items from the surface in order to return back with them just like in the Kshatriya DLC mission. They could sell a brand new map as DLC every 6 or so months, each map uniquely designed with unique and very powerful mutants such as the Librarian or the Rhino or the Shrimp and so on...

""War never change"", indeed. In war, there is no winner we are all loser. We lose lives, properties, and important things in our life. It's quite sad but this is how this game was made. The last speech that Colonel Miller said ""It is time, Artyom"" hits different. This game gave me both love and sorrow, any man who focused on the story line will understand what I said. Also, trusting a friend can be deceiving, I don't want to spoil no more if you wanna know what I'm talking about then you must buy this game (also part of supporting those who made it). This game is a masterpiece no matter how long it was made. Overall, this game is 10/10 for me.

In game reactions, well I like how the graphics was made so smooth and very detailed, no blur (especially when you hit the part where there is a stripper and when Paves invites you into their territory). I accidentally pressed E, it turns out pretty well that 5 bullets I paid was worth it good dancing. There is no glitch or bug in the game. 

Pros:

+ Smooth game play
+ Great story line
+ No blur in every scene very detailed
+ God-tier game
+ Worth it every penny you spend on buying this game

Cons
+ Not at all

Conclusion:
If you like a post-apocalyptic game you must buy and you won't regret it.

Metro Last Light was a game i pre-ordered on the Xbox360. i remember being so hurt by this game. it had day one DLC for spartan mode or something, where you had to pay $5 for a difficulty setting if you had not pre-ordered, so basically you just had to pre-order plus it was cheaper than standard in my region at the time. However the game had a really poor FOV on the xbox 360 and was near unplayable. it also had sections of the game which were faster pace than the original and that made the problem worse.

Now on PC + Redux edition, FOV problem is solved by editing an .ini file. So at the very least the game is playable, good even. My main problem is the general presentation of the game. While 2033 was based on the book and was more subtle in its themes, Last Light is more in-your-face about everything. There were more cutscenes and alot of it feels like an action movie, some slow-mo, always a sense of urgency and the player is sort of told how to feel throughout the chapters. Gameplay is improved.

i think the best thing to come out of all this, is that Last Light sold alot of copies back in the day, and 4A took that money and made Metro 2033 Redux along with the Last Light Redux.

I love looking at people, who have arachnophobia, play this game!

This game it’s like the  developers saw what fell short in Metro 2033 (broken stealth, cumbersome  gun play, weird story telling, lack of background music) then fixed it in Metro Last Light Redux. Very polished!

The pacing and the variety of the levels/missions are great. It's amazing as an atmospheric story FPS. It's very good at creating mood and atmosphere.  So if a post apocalyptic wasteland full of radiated monsters and subway stations populated almost exclusively by constantly warring factions of Russians and Germans scares you, then it might not be your thing.  But keep in mind you play as a very capable military guy, so you're completely able to murder pretty much anything in the game that tries to scare you.

It's more thriller than horror. Dead space is horror, Metro is more about keeping you on the edge of your seat not jumping out of it. When I first played through last light I was in a mental place where it felt so good to just sit and soak in all the misery surrounding you. It was like an outlet for me to feel my depression and just feel the s**t out of it.  Amazing.

I also had such a fantastic time with the enemy Al. Enemy soldiers used alot of teamwork, suppressed, covered friends, and fell back when they felt like they were losing a fight. Mutant Al was even better. They acted like a member of their species, and each different type of mutant fought differently. Moreover, I actually felt like I. was fighting PEOPLE and ANIMALS, not mindless robots.

It's pretty fun if you're into Russian language, radiationally mutated beings, being friends with some of those mutated beings, caring how many bullets you fire and collect. Lastly, being morally good to have the greatest ending. 

If you have any love for emotions or immersion in gaming, this game does the best job, can’t describe how good the Redux is, possibly the best written, immersive emotional game I’ve ever played.

Unfortunately Metro Last Light gets low appreciation sometimes because many Americans and Europeans can’t comprehend the glorious Slavic soul and atmosphere.

A lot of Americans end Europeans love casual and easy games such as COD or BF. The Metro series are too complex sometimes for their intellect, yet it deserves a minimum 10/10, they are all true masterpieces.

I would like to say this game is very good, but it is not Metro Last Light. It is a story that was taken from a writting room and made into a game. The real Metro Last Light (the book) would have been so much better of a game. In the book it follows Hunter, the polis ranger that gives Artyom the quest thast kicks off the first book and game. If this game was at all like the book we would have seen a much more horror and action filled metro game. (the book) follows Hunter and two other people on a quest in the most haunted and dark tunnels in the metro. In it they encounter a monster that kills people by spewing fog around them in a station that no one ever gets out of. There is so much violence in it, hunter likes to live alone at the end of the metro and takes on some of the most dangerous work. Like standing watch for a full station alone deep in a tunnel with only a knife and his AK. As the story goes on we see hunter is a one man death squad cutting down anything in his path, there is a young girl that he saves along the way.

The reworked version of Metro 2033 in Metro: Last Light's far superior engine makes perfect sense. It offered a chance for 4A Games to go back and fix a ton of things that have been bugging them. To act on lessons learnt from their mistakes the first time round.

The Redux version of Last Light is pretty much the same game as 2033 redux.

And so, here we are. Facing a re-release of a game little more than a year old. A re-release that offers little extra to PC gamers whose rigs were up to the task of running it the first time, that looks almost identical to the version you played last May.

In fact, where Metro 2033 Redux is a lovingly improved version of the original, Metro Last Light Redux is little more than a GOTY version. It includes every piece of DLC released to date and some of the additional weapons have been integrated into the single player story.

Visually the games are practically the same. I played the original and the Redux version alternately, chapter by chapter, and found it easy to forget which version I was playing at any given moment. Not to say that Metro Last Light Redux is bad looking. As I was saying, there is a one year gap between the original game and the remastered version, so it's still a fantastic-looking game. Which is why it doesn't need a remaster.

With so much special attention given to Metro 2033 Redux however, Last Light Redux isn't nearly as essential by comparison. Which is fitting, since it's also the worse game of the two. It's a fine shooter, but fans of the original's survival horror feel were disappointed by the sequel's focus on bombastic combat and boss fights over survival and atmosphere.

A new ""Survivor"" mode does its best to recreate that feel of Metro 2033 by making ammo more scarce and enemies more aggressive, but it feels little more than an attempt at a quick fix solution. Your mileage may vary on this. Some of you may prefer Last Light's feel. For those that want it, there's a new ""Spartan"" mode available in Metro 2033 Redux which emulates Last Light's combat system. Be aware that I will judge you for using it.

It makes sense for Metro Last Light Redux to exist on consoles, with locked 60fps framerate and higher resolution being the main selling points. Obviously this doesn't really impact PC owners. If you've not played Last Light before then Redux is worth picking up. It saves you some money over the original version, but if you already own the game there's very little to draw you back and buy it again. Unless you really want another set of Steam achievements.",1697748534,1697748534,True,6,0,0.589987099170684814,0,True,False,False

This game is very interesting. It was no different than the last game. It had the same combat, weapons, grenades. And the first time I played it, it didn't grab me like the first one. But I took a break. And I'm still shaking after the end.
I don't know why, but I have a weird connection with this game. I don't know if it's because I'm Slavic and I live in a former communist country, but somehow the story, the characters, the ruins of Moscow, they feel so close to me. Sometimes it's difficult, sometimes it's scary and sometimes it's downright annoying.
But despite everything, Metro completely captivates me.
The music is amazing and Artyom is one of my favorite main characters. The way he writes, thinks and acts is truly unique.

You can learn a lot from Metro.

It is actually a pretty long game surprisingly for an fps title. Yes It is linear in a sense, but there are many nooks and cranies that you will be exploring. And the game doesn't get boring at all. Each chapter is just more insane than the last. The writing is amazing!

The graphics are also great and still hold up for 2023, the AI is also pretty decent and challenging.
It is truly immersive with 7.1 surround and settings set at very high with minimal hud, i have also taken soooooooo many screenshots because everything is so beautiful to look at. I suggest you play this game in total darkness.
I want to mention also that voice acting is top notch, especially when set to russian language. 

There may be some bugs, or a few crashes, but these were few and far in between and don't overshadow the greatness of the game.

Ця гра є продовженням популярного Metro 2033 і не тільки вдосконалює багато аспектів попередньої частини, але й розширює світ історії Артема та інших жителів московського метро.

Однією з найвизначніших рис гри є її атмосфера. Місце дії - постапокаліптичне метро Москви, і Metro: Last Light вдається створити дуже вірну та напружену атмосферу. Гра виглядає вражаюче, з неймовірною увагою до деталей у створенні станцій, тунелів і підземних обстановок. Ця атмосфера робить гру особливою і влаштовує гравця на величезну атмосферну подорож.

З погляду геймплею, Metro: Last Light також вражає. Ви будете боротися з різними ворогами, використовуючи різноманітну зброю, включаючи імпровізовані прилади і стандартну бойову зброю. Але важливо також звернути увагу на те, що бої в цій грі не завжди є найкращим рішенням, оскільки ресурси обмежені, і ви часто повинні приховуватися та обходити ворогів, щоб вижити.

Сюжет гри дуже цікавий і завершує історію, почату в Metro 2033. Ви будете занурені в інтриги, зраду, і вас чекає багато несподіваних поворотів подій.

Загалом, Metro: Last Light - це гра, яка варта вашої уваги, якщо ви фанати постапокаліптичних шутерів з насиченою атмосферою, захоплюючим сюжетом та інтенсивним геймплеєм. Ця гра добре виконує свої обіцянки і залишить вас з багатьма незабутніми враженнями.",1572503668,1694945288,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

To be honest I doubt whatever I type here will do justice to how good this game actually is, but here we go.

So Last Light is the follow up to Metro 2033, a post apocalyptic, first person, survival shooter that takes place in the remains of Moscow, where the poor people were force to retreat underground, in the metro, from a nuclear holocaust unleashed by the most powerful countries in the word against each other, and taking the rest of the world with them.
This is a reality that we, I fear are coming closer and closer and it is quite scary, considering actual world events that are taking place at the time of this review.

Now the story of this game takes place a short while after the events of Metro 2033, starting with an investigation into the last survivor of his alien kind to uncovering the truth about what power hungry people are willing to do in order to controll people. All of this, in a journey that can be about forgiving and being forgiven or about revenge and the bad deeds that people are capable of.
The story has a moral driven narrative, based upon the choices you make while playing.

The overall atmosphere of this title is dark, gloomy and foreboding while you are making your way through whatever remains usable in the Moscow underground, or the grey wasteland of what was once a city, an irradiated grave for all the people that weren't able to get to safety. There are also some rare places of color, light and joy, these are the safe heavens of the Metro, the stations where people have gathered into communities, trying to survive the end of days, actually having families and being happy, making music and forming a semblance of the civilization that was once above ground.
These are the 2 stark contrasts between dark or grey, empty and dreadful to light, music and joy.
Both the graphics and sound design capture the overall feel of this world amazingly, bringing to the screen the world portrayed in the Metro books.

The gameplay is a standard FPS affair with quite a few twists that are well suited to the type of experience that the devs aimed to craft. To begin with, resources are finite and you have to be careful how you spend them, bullets, first aid kits, bombs and so on are finite, and on the higher difficulties not very plentiful. You can engage your enemies in 2 ways, be it either in a stealthy manner or guns blazing. I adopted a very conservative play style for my play through of Metro Last Light, taking the stealth approach as often as I could in order to preserve my resources for any sort of unwanted encounter with a boss level enemy or a fight against multiple opponents.

Weapon wise this game has decent variety of them, rifles, SMGs, a sniper, some pistols and even 2 air powered guns. Every gun looks well used, some of them are hand crafted in the metro while others are relics of the world above and are barely kept in working order.

The only gripe I have with this game, and it's silly one, is the English voice acting. It's not bad, far from it in fact, but its the damn stereotypical Russian accent. At some point in the game I had a hard time taking something serious because of how funny I found it. Gonna be honest, stereotypes, tho not always true, make me laugh every time.

This game is worth the price, the story was so good, the gameplay is a breath of fresh air in a CoD dominated market, and the atmosphere is amazing. Metro Last Light is now one of my favorite games ever, and if I managed to convince you that it is worth buying, I hope you enjoy this game for yourself.",1685709198,1694763677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The less : 

- The story is better in the first.
- Build-up and set-up are better in the first one. ( The plot of the first game felt more smooth in terms of progression is gone with a rather boring and unengaging story, I admit in the last few hours I lost all interest and just wanted to finish the game )
- Too many chapters that serve no purpose and are too short, which was better in the first one ( duration length )
- No climax, and the story is far-fetched and cartoonishly portrayed, predictable and annoyingly clichéd.
- No new mechanics, that must be used.

The pros :

- The game is a little more fun.
- Better art direction.
- Better enemies, mini/bosses, environment.
- More gunfights.
- Better areas and hub.
- Sexy pleasure dancers.
- Improved graphics.
- The AI seems to be legermenetly a bit better than its predecessor.
- Some new weapons.
- The game is oriented more towards action than infiltration, whereas it could be more discreet.
- The mechanic of shooting projectors/lights is there, but the player is never forced to use it, which I think is a shame.
- The soundtrack is still absent, as it was in 2033, which could have helped reinforce the atmosphere if it had been emphasized.
- DLC, which makes it longer and more complete than 2033.

My conclusion :

The writing is laughable except if you have low-standart I guess. 
If you care more about the gameplay/fun you will prefer LL, if it's for the ambient/build-set-up and atmosphere probably 2033. 
But LL atmosphere is not hugely different from its predecessor, but I would say less present overall ( still averrage as 2033 ) I loved the level in the Swamp per example.
It's considered as a survival horror but ammos are plenty and you never feel you're gonna run out, the game itself isn't very scary as well, I never felt scared nor did I feel desperate for resources, and the same applies to the Survival mode, when you play as little as possible without exploring too much.

Movement is very jerky. Movement on the ground sometimes feels glitchy. Slight elevations from the ground can give you a glitchy feeling.
Gunplay is slow; on most levels, you can simply run past enemies without any consequences, without needing to waste ammunition. It's true, you can ignore most enemies. They don't detect you very well, so you can just walk right past them.
Honestly a lot of the game is slowly following an NPC through a very boring scripted walk with nothing happening at all, it felt like one of the least interactive games, even a visual novel had more interactivity at times.
The gameplay can be chosen from hard-hitting, infiltration, tactical or a mix of all of these. 
The game alternates between action and rest phases, depending on the level and chapter. 

Exploration is supposed to be a minimum requirement in Survival mode, with difficulty higher than Normal; in Spartan, the player can just rush around without worrying, without encountering any difficulty in most levels. 
Metro is a slow fps-shooter in its gameplay, and even if you play like a brute in action with a nervous gameplay, the game will remain slow.
Because it's a game that's simply immersive in a first-person shooter and relies mainly on its atmosphere, and its not very addictive gameplay, which is generic in the fps world in my opinion, it innovates and doesn't bring anything to the table, although I applaud the studio's work.
 
""Artyom!""/10 is a bad character who is just a <fetch quest>character when his psychological state could have been put forward to care about him a little.
Scripting a game with (dialogues, discussions, questions/answers) without Artyom being able to answer, the impression of controlling a mute spoils the whole immersion.",1694611106,1694611388,False,3,0,0.48953711986541748,0,True,False,False

It improves many things from the first game, pacing being the most notable.  The first one had a very grindy survival horror zombie apocalypse feel, where this one pushes the pace and leans harder into action.   The characters and story are flushed out a bit more, though many feel even more one dimensional than they did in the first.  If you like Russian end of the world war stories, this one will scratch that itch quite well.  

The biggest fault with the game is the nonsensical moral choices that determine what ending you get.  Both endings are fine, they fit the story.  [spoiler]However, most of what ending you get boils down how you choose to play out the big showdowns with the mini boss characters.

One of the best sequels and FPS post apocalyptic games of all time! Almost on par with Fallout New Vegas except the Metro games are very restrictive and linear! The gunplay is decent enough but nothing to special. The graphics and sound are great. The story is also decent and the game world is crafted amazingly. Artyom is back again as the silent protagonist except during the loading screens. Anna the love interest for Artyom is not interesting and is barely in this game but the sequel Exodus redeems her character and makes up for it. Of course there is nudity like babes with bare tits and nice curves and ass to help sell the game haha. The male character models are great but the females ones all look unrealistic and samey. The voice acting is amazing only in Russian. Never play this game with English dubbing! Just put the voice on Russian with English Subtitles to be completely immersed in this post apocalyptic metro station in Moscow! I recommend this and it's previous game Metro 2033 they're both rich in lore. I've never read the books so these games do a good enough job. I feel this ""remaster"" of this particular game didn't change the graphics enough like they did with Metro 2033 Redux and instead in this Redux the only thing that's been changed is the lighting which mucb brighter which is disappointing which sucks because I feel the original Last Light has better lighting and detail!

The best thing about the metro games for me is how  its not just a standard straight forward shooter. The addition of inventory management and stress of looking after your valuable respirator means that you always have to think on your feet in various scenarios. The game is an excellent sequel to the first glimpse into the Metro universe. Last light does everything better than its predecessor. Expanding the world which felt already so lived in and moving the story in strange but powerful ways you can understand why these games have received such high praise and devout following. 
Fantastic game play moments can be had with shoot outs in radiation ridden wastelands and tunnels, some of which are considerably larger and free roaming than the first. 

Visually this game is a little buggy but nothing game breaking and still performs well graphics hold up pretty well.  The best way to experience metro is with headphones on as the sound is incredible and often truly terrifying.

The first half isn't good, which is the point where I almost quit playing. After looking up a guide online and seeing I was halfway through the game, I continued playing the second half which is better but that was a low bar to surpass anyway.

The problem is the sequel's direction; instead of ""Metro 2033 but better"" the sequel was ""not Metro 2033, let's make a generic action game"". At one point in the story one of the NPCs even calls you ""an army of one"", which is what the sequel is aiming to make the protagonist. The sequel's gameplay wasn't meant to be a sequel to Metro 2033, just the sequel's story. The story suffers because of this though because they have to fit in boss fights that regularly break the flow of the storyline.

This isn't a game to buy for the game itself, it's a game you should get as part of a franchise bundle.

A combination of the games amazing UI and sound design combined with its avoidance of 'gamey' mechanics makes it an incredibly immersive game to play though.

Review: Love the game and this series. I played the first game years ago and decided to finish this one before I start Exodus just to get the full experience. Graphics are great for how old this game is, the combat is decent albeit a little stiff but I like to think it adds to the ""grounded"" feel to it. The story picks up where the first left off but the atmosphere and lore are what really sell this game. Now I haven't beaten it yet but I would be alot further if I hadn't come across this bug in the Chapter ""Bandits"". When you reach the part where you have to ring the bell for the ferry, whenever I would press the reload/interact button, my character would freeze in place and could only look around. I wouldn't be able to do anything else. I would reload the checkpoint to no avail and ultimately had to restart the chapter MULTIPLE times only to keep running into the same issue. Well I found out that if you restart the chapter and reach the point where you exit the train into the area where you ring for the ferry, as soon as you reach that area DO NOT RELOAD OR PICK ANYTHING UP.  You should be able to press the interact button and ring the bell and still be able to attack and heal yourself but whatever you do, DO NOT PRESS THE RELOAD/INTERACT BUTTION. Whenever you run out of ammo, you will auto-reload and fend off the enemies until the ferry reaches you. Once it loads into the next area, you should be able to continue playing as usual.

No matter what you do, the game is basically holding your hand, I honestly feel like I'm watching a terribly directed movie at points. Why so many people find this game amazing baffles me, I guess the soundtrack is ok, and some characters like Anna are funny but overall not spectacular.

I don't feel bad for characters that die or are suffering because they lack emotion or purpose. Sure the game's old but COD 1 absolutely nailed campaigns in 2010 and it was most likely more linear then this trash.

Gameplay-wise, I couldn't tell any significant differences (minor changes were made to Artyom's watch) in comparison to the first game of the series. The player can choose between a stealth- or action-oriented gameplay. If you enjoyed the first game, you will probably enjoy the sequel. 

Story-wise, the sequel dwells more into the Dark Ones and humanity's choices that led to the destruction of the world and that might lead to even more bloodshed. The atmosphere is really well constructed, aligning great with the story. Just as in the first game, the player's actions have influence over the ending through a system of ""moral points"" (which are not really explained in-game, but can be inferred).

An okay sequel to Metro 2033, which follows the first game's bad ending. It emphasizes more on gameplay over worldbuilding.

Story: The first game definitely had the better intro and middle section between the two, but the climax here was much better and felt like a real endgame battle, unlike the first game. The story felt like it had too much focus on the politics within the metro. Although not bad, it felt a little too overused for these kinds of games, especially within the FPS genre, but I'm glad they followed up on the first ending's bad route, which actually had more potential than the good route. It did, however, give the players a better understanding of the creatures in the world and gave us more mutants to deal with, but that's about it. One advantage it had one the first game was the DLCs. It expanded the lore of the factions and gave us information on the missing parts of the story which was great. The only DLCs that I felt the game didn't really need was The Tower and Kshatriya DLCs.

Gameplay: The gameplay, although pretty much the same as in Metro 2033, felt much better. We had a ton more variety for both enemies and weapons. There are now actual bosses you can battle, which do not feel like minigames, unlike the first game's biomass and the dark one at the end. The new weapon additions felt really great and packed just the right power. The customization of weapons was also expanded, with some weapons getting new attachments. It made so much sense that they added a sniper rifle, which was the one gun I felt that the first game really needed. Finally, the stealth, although it did not change at all, feels somewhat better. Maybe it is due to the placement of the enemies or the lightbulbs? I wonder. 

Sound & Visuals: The graphics are okay; they did not change from Metro 2033 Redux; they have the same models, effects, and everything else. The voice acting of some characters still felt a bit off, and the children still did not sound like proper children. The music was a bit too loud at times, even at the lowest volume, but it will sometimes not be that audible. The lights from the enemies were horrendous and were too bright at times, especially when paired with night vision. It just sucked so bad, and I had to sometimes take a break due to the glaring lights.

Enjoyment: If gameplay is what you enjoyed from the first game, this one will definitely be the better game for you, but if you're like me, who enjoyed the more story and ambiance aspects, this might feel like a little bit of a downgrade from the first game. Overall, it is still a good entry in the series.",1691419192,1691419192,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're not playing on the hardest difficulty whats the point. In the first game you still had a way to keep track of ammo, it never ruined my immersion to be able to check my ammo when I was safe. Quick time events are hidden, good luck unless you beat it on a lower difficulty. 
Story is terrible, you spend the first game in a epic crusade against the Dark Ones and nuke their asses back to the stone age for attacking your home. In the next game you're baby-sitting some dumb baby one its terrible.

With its gripping narrative, refined gameplay, and atmospheric world-building, Last Light Redux offers a haunting and memorable experience.

The storyline of Last Light Redux is a captivating continuation of the Metro saga. As Artyom, you embark on a quest to save humanity from the brink of destruction. The narrative delves deeper into the lore and mythology of the Metro, exploring the complexities of factional politics and the struggle for power. The characters you encounter are well-written and memorable, each with their own motivations and agendas.

The atmosphere in Last Light Redux is as haunting as ever. The Metro's tunnels and the surface world are brought to life with meticulous detail and atmospheric lighting. From the remnants of a ravaged cityscape to the eerie darkness of underground catacombs, every location feels unique and evokes a sense of dread. The game's ability to immerse you in its world is truly commendable.

The gameplay mechanics in Last Light Redux have been refined and improved. The combination of stealth, combat, and exploration offers a diverse and dynamic gameplay experience. The stealth mechanics have been enhanced, allowing for more tactical approaches to encounters. While gunplay remains satisfying, the scarcity of resources keeps the tension high, making every bullet count.

A standout feature in Last Light Redux is the morality system. Your actions and decisions throughout the game can influence the outcome and the fate of certain characters and factions. This moral dilemma adds depth to the narrative, making you consider the consequences of your choices and reinforcing the theme of humanity's struggle for survival and redemption.

The Redux version of Last Light brings improved graphics and performance, making the game even more visually stunning. The attention to detail in character models, environmental design, and lighting effects enhances the immersion and the emotional impact of the story. The sound design and haunting musical score further contribute to the game's atmospheric and emotionally charged experience.

In conclusion, Metro: Last Light Redux is a gripping and thought-provoking journey into the heart of darkness. With its engaging narrative, refined gameplay mechanics, and chilling atmosphere, it stands as a worthy successor to the Metro franchise. If you were captivated by the world of Metro 2033 Redux, Last Light Redux is an essential continuation of the post-apocalyptic adventure. Prepare to descend into a world of peril, hope, and the ever-lingering question of what it truly means to be human in the face of adversity.",1688488158,1688488158,True,10,0,0.649266242980957031,0,True,False,False

Metro Last Light continues the story from the first game with the same level of quality. Graphically, there are only a few improvements compared to the previous game, but that doesn't mean the game doesn't still look fantastic and hold up very well even today.

I’m really conflicted about this game. Metro mostly excelled because of the amazing atmosphere, unique setting, and story. I found the first game way much more memorable, but this doesn’t say last light is a bad game. There are many improvements compared to the original base game, not the redux version. Which is another thing I will talk about.

[u]Redux[/u]
First of all, the problem is that I don’t see any reason to really have a remastered version of this game except to cash in some more. The only real change in the game is the “graphical” update which basically just makes the games texture have more gamma or something. Original used to get a discount, which for the metro 2033 remake is justified, but not for this “remaster” of last light. Only reason I don’t recommend THIS version of the game as I don’t like such practices. Down below a review to the game itself.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
The biggest change is the stealth system, which is now harder and more fleshed out due to the possibility of knocking out people which rewards moral points instead of killing in stealth sections so you can get the good ending.

The combat feels quicker albeit I didn’t found the impact of the guns as good as in the first game, mainly due to a mix between design, animation and sounds. I would say the combat is improved due to it being more often in the game and also more difficult due to more, faster and tougher enemies.. Resources on the other hand are even less of a problem than in the first game as you can even pick up weapons and sell them.
You can choose between spartan and survival mode, the latter being the biggest change that filters run out faster/you find less and the reloading animations are slowed down, which looks odd as its just literally a slowed down version of the same 

I really like the new weapons added into the game, generally a good progression while also giving player choice. You want to use a faster shooting weapon like the Kalasch 2012 or a more accurate with more damage but a tiny clip size like the SSV? Its not a complete straight line of upgrading your weapons anymore but a slowly progression with a lot of player choice. Neat!

The biggest offender in this game is the tedious trailing mission again, the whole game is longer but also has more of everything, more stealth, more shooting, more exploring but also more trailing missions.

[u]Story[/u]
Here is where I don’t really seem to make my mind up on it. It’s a good thing they made a new story and skipped the atrocious sequel book. But the base story that is there feels a lot more off from the tone of the original. The metro itself is a very desolate place with some sprinkles of civilization, but most of the time you will find sprawling cities full of people on and even on the surface. 

The new story is totally fine, but ends a bit too happy, especially that the black ones now wield absolute supernatural power, being immune to gunshots, can manipulate the mind and physical realm as they please. Also, the ending works with a lot of deus ex machinas or just general plotholes altogether I won’t spoil.
Albeit I like that the different factions are being shown slightly more albeit its mostly rangers, Reich and commies being focused on.

What really annoys me are some of the newly introduced characters, Anna. Early on you get her as a short companion who is supposed to be a really good marksman. The thing is her character is just utterly annoying to me, she belittles the player and calls her rabbit, someone who has singlehandedly killed off (due to a speech between two guards this is canon) two armies on the frontline map or met multiple mutants and anomalies. I don’t know what’s dumber, the writing to make a strong independent woman who insults the player, or the character itself.

The premise is clear to most people and as soon as you meet the black creature you have to run around with some kind of goblin that is supposed to be cute because it trying to learn human culture and language. But what hits me is the dumb writing in this case, why exactly can he speak perfectly Russian, but randomly asks the player how they call things. Like storms or clothes.
It’s definitely not all to bad, especially the dialogues from guards or other side characters you meet are really interesting, especially unique characters like Pavel are a great addition that really invested me into the game.

[u]Sound[/u]
Not only are good, well-known tracks from the first game here, but also a lot of new ones and best of all a lot of environmental sound effects. Stuff that you would hear in Stalker and such. Very eerie and atmospheric. I really favour a good soundscape, and a good environmental track repertoire is always something I like the most in games.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Considering the base games graphics, I was mostly impressed by the surface area biomes. From the wind effects to the general detail in the many destroyed buildings in the fore and background of the levels its one of the graphically most impressive games I played. Additionally, the feature that the gas mask will have blood/dirt or water hindering the sight was a neat addition. 

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
Metro still excels in giving me an atmospheric game I can lose myself in. Combat is fun and the resource management is still rewarding me for exploring albeit I don’t need it that much as its not balanced that well. Its not all well tough as I found the story itself rather lacking, especially some characters you meet. The biggest issue the trailing missions are back again and bigger than ever. I think its new additions average out the downsides and make it a slightly less memorable game.

Decent fps that does not really improve on its predecessor and doesn't justifiy the redux tag.

I say almost because a couple of areas like story and moral point feature (great as they both still are) didn't quite match up to the original in my opinion. However, that's no reason to ignore this great title especially if you enjoyed 2033.

The plot takes off sometime from the original game's canon ending when the missiles were launched. The Dark Ones are seemingly obliterated and Artyom has joined the Spartan Order - a group of rangers and stalkers that fight for the Polis station, perhaps the least corrupt faction in all the Metro. While the Spartans now have control of the D6 bunker, reports reveal that a single Dark One managed to survive the destruction and tasked with hunting it down with Colonel Miller's daughter Anna. However, Khan insists to Artyom to spare it as this may be his last chance to redeem himself after the horrible act he committed. Meanwhile, multiple factions throughout the Metro have their eyes on D6, with the biggest hellbent threat being the Stalinist Red Line. Artyom must survive these hazzles by compromising with the surviving Dark One and proving to it that there is still some morality left and humanity deserves to be spared from its species' vengeful wrath.

Cannot say too much about the gameplay as it is not significantly different, but it did not need to be. Last Light makes many improvements to the experience though with more detailed and polished stealth elements for instance. The levels also have a little more variety now. For example, one level which I particularly enjoyed has you controlling a rail car and using light/flames to fight spiders in creepy optionally explorable halls. For me though, one of the biggest selling points are the mission add-ons which provide more content after you have completed the main storyline. You get to play as different factions and characters, and all of this gives new layers to the world of the Metro. My favourite mission of all was the Spartan Ranger one as that had the most exploration and replay value, allowing you to explore the library (where you encountered the dreaded librarians from before) and scavenge for valuables while you upgrade and unlock new routes. And the graphics, well... what more needs to be said about those!

The game is not without flaws however. One for me involves the story. Don't get me wrong it is *still* a great tale. But some elements felt rushed or underdeveloped; for instance, the Red Line being the only true antagonists with a very one-dimensional villain, my question was ""Why just them? Why are they the only people that really care about D6?"". There is no answer/motive to this other than the main villain is just purely BAD and happens to care more about this than other bad guys in the Metro. Yes, the Reds are evil but when you get captured by Neo-Nazis, discover their concentration camps and witness murdering of innocent individuals for sick reasons such as ""slightly disproportionate"" head shapes, you'd think such a group would be more actively hostile to the player throughout the story. The idea that such an extreme faction with a fanatical leader would cease to be a threat for the remainder of the story (and stop caring about D6) after a short encounter does not make sense. It gives off this impression that either the writers cut some things out, or inserted things that never had much bearing on the intended plot to begin with. None of this stops the story from being an emotional rollercoaster with moving and touching moments, but it is a still little disappointing that the Fourth Reich and other factions play such a minor role with no involvement in the game's final battle. Had they been featured more, I feel there was potential to add more intensity to the plot. 

Another flaw is that the moral point system seems a lot more difficult than before. In Metro 2033 it was not too difficult to obtain the ""good"" ending as a lot of the points were self-explanatory. In Last Light however, a lot of them are just highly obscure and easy to miss. For instance, some stealth segments which are easy to progress through will have no moral points to gain/lose while other trickier ones do. Like, why is killing one hostile patrol morally ambiguous while killing the other is not? I did not feel like I needed a walkthrough in 2033 to obtain enough points to unlock both endings. In this case however, it took 3 attempts (even with a guide) to unlock the ""good"" ending which is just silly considering that one is supposed to be the canon one here.

Despite a few minor faults, this game is well worth picking up. Not many FPS's nowadays provide such deep and emotionally unforgettable experiences. I also highly recommend playing these games with the audio set to Russian for more immersion.

I played it on ""Spartan Mode"", because I'm not thrilled with the tight ammo allotments in the other mode, and found it to be more enjoyable, overall.

This game works well on Linux using Proton 7.x.

***Minor Spoilers Ahead***

I do feel like the ""good ending""/""bad ending"" mechanics are really broken, though.  Throughout the game, there are a number of places where you have choices to do the nice thing or the mean thing.  When you do the nice thing, you get a white flash on the screen with alien sounds to accompany it.  When you do the mean thing, you get a dark flash, instead.  This is great.  The problem is that you can go throughout the entire game making nice decisions and still get the ""bad ending"" because you didn't find the dozen or so easter eggs that the developers insist you locate in order to get the ""good ending"".  So, even though you did everything right, you get the bad ending because you didn't find four hidden ammo caches on a certain level, didn't strum a guitar on another level, or didn't listen to enemy guards talking about nothing for several minutes.  In the end, it gives the feeling that ""choices don't actually matter, but satisfying the developers' ego does"".  So, if you want to see the ""good ending"", just watch it on YouTube.  If you try to get it through gameplay, you will almost certainly be frustrated.  Instead, I recommend just playing the game how you want to play it, and simply expect that the ending will suck no matter what you do.

-Tonnes of predictable and immersion-breaking quick time events

-Voice actors for kids were terrible
-An outdated checkpoint-based saving system. If you screw up and have no meds/ammo left, good luck for the next checkpoint!

Again, this reminds me of half life 2, but this time episode 2, where its more combat oriented, same as Last Light, which is more combat oriented than 2033. 

I like this metro more than the past metro, more action packed, the new weapons are sick, and i had some fun fighting the bosses (kinda ruined bcz i ran out of filters but wearing and throwing the mask off is so adrenaline rush it turned back into me loving the fight even more), somehow made me tolerate the nazis more than the communists (dont quote me on this one please [spoiler] I GOT FUCKING BETRAYED BRUH I HAD NO CHOICE [/spoiler]) Enjoyed the story a bit more than the first entry (2033 had a good story btw), had fun on every action sequences, and I kill everyone I meet, except when the choice is right at my screen asking to spare or kill. So yes the terrible decision of killing is bad knocking them out is good is back.
I just wished there were more choices to spare or fight them without killing them. You know, with a tranq gun/bullet? or like the shield? which they introduced at the end of the game for some reason or maybe present more hand to hand fight? like what... 

But then again, I enjoyed this one more than 2033.

This game has it all: gripping storytelling, intense gunplay, and enough atmospheric tension to make your heart pound faster than a speeding mutant.

Picture this: you're sneaking through the darkness, hoping the flickering lightbulbs don't give away your position, when suddenly a horde of grotesque mutants charges at you like they haven't had their daily dose of post-apocalyptic caffeine. It's like a monstrous flash mob, and you're the unwilling star of the show.

But fear not, because the arsenal at your disposal is as diverse as the mutated creatures you'll encounter. From shotguns that pack a punch to homemade contraptions that would make MacGyver proud, you'll be armed and dangerous against any foe that crosses your path.

And let's not forget the immersive graphics that transport you straight into the dilapidated beauty of Moscow's underground. The attention to detail is so astounding that you'll catch yourself gawking at the scenery instead of focusing on staying alive.

Metro: Last Light Redux is a rollercoaster of a game that blends tension, action, and a touch of dark humor in one unforgettable package. Strap on your gas mask, buckle up, and get ready to embark on a post-apocalyptic adventure that will make you laugh, gasp, and maybe even question your survival skills.

Check my review of 2033 if you want to know more about the world of metro.

9,5/10
The writing in Metro: Last Light Redux is excellent! It picks up where Metro 2033 left off, following the protagonist Artyom on his quest to save humanity from annihilation. The narrative is filled with moral choices, intricate political dynamics, and emotionally charged moments that make the player's journey through the tunnels of the Metro truly engaging.
It's a showcase of the grim beauty of a decaying world.

Redux also benefits from gameplay improvements and refinements, making it a more polished and enjoyable experience compared to its original release. The enhancements contribute to smoother combat, improved AI behavior, and overall gameplay satisfaction.

The DLCs are Okay... except the TOWER... no way that one was playtested, it's bit... DIFFICULT (and that comes from Ranger Hardcore player).

All in all...Metro Last Light has a captivating story, exciting gameplay, and a frightening atmosphere. It provides a thrilling post-apocalyptic experience that fans of atmospheric fps will enjoy.

- Way to many cutscenes, some useless, many long, some that add little to the story, & finally some interactive ones that apparently you should 'know what to do' BEFORE you have to reload a few times.
- Quite a few battles are  foolishly difficult, more enemies attacking from every angle than you have the ammo to repel. Even on the easiest difficulty, some spots have more enemies than one can actually shoot. They attack in such quick succession the weapons available are unable to reload fast enough or need to load themselves when switching. It is just dumb. Presumably the master gamer can crank these settings up but someone just checking out the series for some R & R game playing it just is not enjoyable.
- The objectives are not very clear & often neither is the correct path. 
- There are quite a few glitches, causing one to replay the same levels over & over. This is particularly frustrating when going for some of the Achievements.
After reading & watching many different walkthoroughs to determine WHAT TO actually DO and playing through twice it was better but I will not play through again as the game wasted way too much of my time with it's (BS).

 metro last light redux is a FPS survival horror game developed by 4A games and published by deep silver that was released in august 2014 for PC, PS4, and xbox one. last light is a direct sequel to 2033 and the franchise creator dmitry glukhovsky wrote the main story and most of the game's dialogue. like it's predecessor, last light is a post apocalyptic-themes fps with stealth and horror mechanics. the areas and levels are larger compared to 2033 and the game encourages exploration a lot more than the first game, by allowing the player multiple paths to choose between. the game also gives players the freedom to utilize different combat tactics.

the dev team kept a strong focus on the atmosphere, as that was one of the main things 2033 was praised for. while doing this, they tried to overhaul numerous gameplay mechanics such as improving the shooting, and animations were refined as well. they made the controls more accessible, and fixed a lot of the issues with the AI. another big goal of the dev team was to incorporate more survival horror elements, as they wanted to make players feel unsettled by playing the game. the story was excellently-written, but i did feel as if the main character was a bit soulless. nonetheless, the story had intimate, compelling, and engaging moments, and while it may have been unevenly paced, the game did a great job making introducing characters that earned genuine sympathy from me. 

i definitely recommend waiting for a sale for this game as you can get it for $3.99 on it's own, or in the metro saga bundle, you can get this game, it's predecessor metro 2033, and the third game in the series, metro exodus for around $15. those are great prices for a couple remasters, PLUS you get the third game in the saga and it's season pass.",1683867179,1683867179,True,1,0,0.485011786222457886,0,True,False,False

But game has problems, knocking out enemies (give moral points for the good ending) will stop at random, and you have to look online how to fix it, nothing about the characters are really interesting or run off your head if you think of Metro, apart from Anna and Artyom.
The characters also aren't written well at all, one moment you're with Anna being talked down like trash, next time you see her few missions later [spoiler] you bang [/spoiler]  - like? 

It's no surprise this game is under the radar. There's nothing about this game that can really hook you in at all. I only highly recommend this game for anybody that wants to know more about the stuff Artyom has been through before starting Exodus.

I played through the game on survival mode and on the second hardest difficulty and might I say, I'm glad I did. The game felt pretty easy for the most part as I played stealth heavily but the combat wasn't to bad either although the combat in the game can be unforgiving at some points like when you find yourself getting the worst check point and having no syringes and needing to reload 1000 times before you can lucky and carry on. This game looks great in my opinion and the grittyness fits the theme of the game really well although, I was taken out of immersion because the game is filled with bugs and some, session ruining ones. My first experience happened when I wanted to reload a checkpoint and to reattempt something, the game crashed and kept crashing when I reloaded and clicked continue. I had to restart the chapter due to it. During one of the last missions I placed a mine and the same problem occurred. besides those darn bugs, I had no other major and/or game breakers besides getting stuck inside enemies or enemies was seeing me through was sometimes but some not seeing me when standing right in front of em LOL. 

All in all Id say give this game a shot because of the dumb but fun combat, interesting areas and (I know I didn't mention it in the first part) great story, even though I didn't really know wtf was going on for a good chunk of it lol. I gonna start reading the series and play through 2033 before carrying on in order!

That system was the weakest part of Metro 2033 because it directly went against the design of the game and existed entirely as a gimmick! Why would they double down on it in the sequel?

The game features stunning graphics and detailed environments that truly transport the player into a desolate, yet beautiful world. The gameplay is engaging and challenging, with a variety of weapons and tactics available to the player.

One of the standout features of Metro: Last Light Redux is the attention to detail in the storytelling. The game builds upon the lore and history established in the previous game, Metro 2033, and expands upon it in fascinating ways. The characters are well-developed and memorable, adding an emotional depth to the game that is often lacking in shooter games.

The survival elements of the game also add to the immersive experience. The player must ration their resources and manage their equipment carefully in order to survive. This adds an extra layer of challenge to the already intense gameplay.

Overall, Metro: Last Light Redux is an excellent game that is not to be missed. With its stunning graphics, engaging gameplay, and immersive storytelling, it is one of the best first-person shooter games on the market.",1677607094,1682629284,True,7,0,0.609731376171112061,0,True,False,False

Note: I played on Survival Normal. [b]I would strongly recommend playing on Hardcore[/b] as Normal was [i]too[/i] easy; having played Hardcore in the first game, Normal took out a lot of the unease and desperation, feelings that really help immerse you in the atmosphere. (That said, I still managed to run out of ammo entirely at one point; mutants are very squishy if you have the wrong gear.) I believe I would have rated this game higher if I played it on Hardcore, but I'm not invested enough to replay it.

To avoid repeating myself too much, I will mostly talk about things specific to Last Light in comparison to 2033. Last Light is in the same world and same engine, for better or worse:
+ Same rich visuals, music, and overall atmosphere.
• Same hit-or-miss voice acting and super expository dialogue.
• [i]Why is Artyom a mute? Why is this built into the gameplay? He talks in between every level, but never during![/i]
• Enemy AI is hit or miss, but I'm used to it and the worst offenders (looking at you, Librarians) don't make a reappearance.
• Stealth is hit or miss.
• Lots of in-engine cutscenes that take control of the camera.
• Comparison/hierarchy of weapons is unclear.
- You may suffocate to death [i]waiting for people to stop talking[/i].
- You walk faster than your companions.
- Night vision is broken.
For more details on these subjects, see my previous review.

Improvements over 2033:
+ There seems to be more to do in the stations, e.g. minigames, and there is more noticeable variety in the environments. Still not really worth spending much time in, but it's an improvement.
+ Artyom's character arc is genuinely interesting: [spoiler]After launching the nukes, he regrets his decision and wants to atone for his sins and save the last Dark One.[/spoiler] He's trying to do the right thing in this war-torn world.
+ I actually like the more segmented level design as compared to 2033 Redux. At least at first, I felt it help with the pacing, though some of the transitions in the later game feel a bit weird and abrupt.
+ Interesting new enemies.
+ Less bugs in general.

Complaints:
- One, mainly: the story. Artyom's personal journey is interesting; the world surrounding it is not. There's a lot of build-up of political conflict between the Order, the Reds, and the Nazis, but overall it felt more confusing and disjointed than compelling.

Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is just a straight improvement from the first. I still had just as much fun romping through the tunnel system and ruins of Moscow, and things feel just a bit smoother here. I don't think there was a single point throughout the game where I had to look up what I was supposed to be doing. 

My largest problem is with the story of the game, so spoilers ahead. 

Metro 2033 had two endings, but it's more likely that players got the ""bad"" ending where Artyom blew up the home of the Dark Ones and killed almost all of their race. The game continues from that outcome, but then constantly blames you for everything that happened. Khan and the child dark one guilt you the entire time about you blowing up all of its family. Not only that, but to get the good ending you have to set a good example for the child dark one following you. Most of the game, revenge against Pavel is the driving force and if you want to get the good ending you completely have to disregard that and choose to save him from the fate he deserves. I cant understand the thought process behind this, yet it seems they continued this trend with Exodus where they continue the game from the bad ending. Here's hoping the next Metro game doesn't do the same.",1681696304,1681696304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Redux version features enhanced graphics, improved lighting, and better overall optimization, making it an even more enjoyable experience than the original release.

The gameplay is intense and challenging, with a great mix of stealth, exploration, and combat. The weapons are well-designed and satisfying to use, and the enemy AI is impressive, providing a real challenge that keeps you engaged.

The story is gripping and emotionally charged, with well-written characters and an engaging plot that keeps you invested until the very end. The atmosphere is dark and oppressive, with a sense of impending doom lurking around every corner.

The sound design is also top-notch, with an incredible soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's themes and creates an immersive experience that draws you in from start to finish.

Overall, Metro Last Light Redux is a masterpiece of a game that delivers an unforgettable gaming experience that will stay with you long after you've finished playing.

If you haven't played Metro 2033 before, I suggest you play it first. Coming to metro 2033 Last Light: if you like story-oriented games without caring about graphics, this game is for you. Both the venue and environments of the game, and the stealth-based gameplay really make the game very enjoyable. Of course, if the weapon animations were a little faster and closer to reality, the game would not be beaten. If you are a suspense lover, there are plenty of tense scenes in the game. In the game, they stretch you a lot, and in some parts, you even get scared with the monsters that come from behind or in front of you. There is sexuality in some scenes of the play. one of them according to the option you choose. another is necessary because it is necessary for the continuation of the story. It has an average of 10 hours of gameplay.

Metro isn't an FPS per se, it's supposed to be played more like a survival horror, especially on the higher difficulties where every bullet counts, and the claustrophobia truly begins to settle in, with no hud, no crosshair, nothing to break the immersion of the stifling atmosphere of the metro tunnels deep under the earth. The world and story of Metro is engrossing in a way few other games can even hope to match, set in an unapologetically bleak, slavic post-apocalypse.

It is a remastered version of the original Metro: Last Light game, with improved graphics, gameplay mechanics, and additional content.

One of the standout features of Metro: Last Light Redux is its atmospheric and immersive world. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, where players must navigate the dangerous underground metro tunnels and the irradiated wasteland above. The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed character models, environments, and lighting effects that help to create a sense of realism and immersion.

The game's gameplay mechanics are also well-crafted. Players must scavenge for resources, manage their weapons and equipment, and engage in tactical combat with both human and mutant enemies. The game also features a stealth system, allowing players to sneak past enemies or take them out quietly.

Another positive aspect of Metro: Last Light Redux is its strong narrative and characters. The game's story is well-written and engaging, with multiple endings and branching paths depending on the player's choices. The game's characters are also well-developed, with their own motivations and backstories that help to create a sense of empathy and connection with the player.

The game also features a variety of additional content, including new levels and gameplay modes. The game's Ranger Mode, for example, removes the game's HUD and increases the difficulty, adding an extra layer of challenge for players looking for a more hardcore experience.

Overall, Metro: Last Light Redux is a well-crafted first-person shooter and survival horror game with a stunning world, engaging gameplay mechanics, and strong narrative and characters.

The game is very linear; pointing you in the correct direction all the time. Not letting you get lost, and never giving you a puzzle to solve. Even with this, the game does not feel linear. Yes, there is no fork in the path. Even with the different choices you make, you are still going to the same places and doing the same things. But it does not feel like that while playing. The gameplay is super unique, in my opinion, offering you to be able to take many different play styles depending what you want to do. Don't want to kill people? Just sneak around all game. Want to play stealth sniper? Or John wick everyone? That's an option.

Beyond just the gameplay, the story is amazing. The dark, gloomy landscape of the surface. The grimy, claustrophobic feel of the metro. It all plays into a very Immersive experience that honestly gets addicting. Even walking around a station and listening to random conversations can be very fun, honestly.

Where Metro 2033 is dark, scary and you crawl step by step through dark tunels, get lost and scavenge for ammo and filters to survive a bit longer, Metro Last Light is much more light and forgiving. The game is much more accesible - ammo is plentiful, maps are more well lit, stealth finally works (yay!) and everything is less gloomy.

Personally, I liked both - while different experiences, both were very well executed and had captivating story, varied missions and a lot to offer. If you're fun of story driven FPS games, I would recommend both!",1679913277,1679913277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
287390,135507484,76561197989377375,0,8,1053,0,551,1680060206,"The ATMOSPHERE is 10/10 and punches way above it's class.  Story and narrative elements are great and also punch way above it's class.  The little towns and villages are a real joy to walk through and see what is going on.  You won't find any side quests or anything like that, but there's a lot of world building going on here, and in the narrative events and cut scenes. 

Graphics are actually still really good.  Several times had to stop the game to take a screen shot and remind myself this came out nearly 10 years ago.  I played on Hardcore mode as that has more of the survival horror/resource management that, for me, adds to the atmosphere.  There's no HUD, which really works on a game like this and really immerses you into the game. 

The gunplay is pretty good, at times the weakest part of the game.  If you're looking to run and gun, do not play hardcore mode.  Hardcore mode plays more like Rainbox Six.  You light up a map of enemies and they will erase you quickly.  For me, Hardcore forced me to stealth through the human conflicts more which I really liked.  Upgrade your weapons, stocks and sights, asap and you'll have a better time.

Stealth plays really well.  Kind of a poor man's Splinter Cell.  I really liked clearing areas and rooms.  Makes you feel like a really bada$$ merc for sure.  Take out the lights, sneak around, shush the bad guys.  Sometimes you have to use throwing knives to distract or make a really silent distance kill to move forward.  All awesome.  My only complaint is that sometimes the activation distance/hitbox or whatever for turning off a light or stealth kill doesn't always kick in when you'd expect.

The mutant battles really force the gunplay so it feels a little bad sometimes.  But this isn't a game that wants to make you feel like a powerful bada$$ on the surface with the mutants.  You're exposed.  Breathing poison air.  The mutants are faster than you and deadly, and you'll feel relief whenever you make it through and back underground where it's ""safe"".

All in all I'd recommend it if this sounds remotely interesting to you.  It's worth the $20 asking price and it regularly goes on sale for less than that.  The developer is based in Kyiv, Ukraine and supporting them through what they're going through, I think, is a good thing.  Here's an excerpt from their website: ""As a company, we’re doing everything we can. We provide financial and logistical assistance to the team scattered across Kyiv and beyond. We’re also proud to support and amplify personal efforts of our staff who are volunteering, making donations, delivering medical supplies and food, and a lot more – most of all those who are fighting on the front lines.""  https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/studio-update-exodus-sdk

With a new companion by his side, Artyom needs to race against time to prevent a civil war. wipe out what's left of humanity.

It is then that the Ranger embarks on a new journey filled with even greater dangers. In this unprecedented adventure, the enemies are not just the terrible mutants or radiation zones, but the very human beings he wants to protect.

The game is an incredible first-person experience, with a wide variety of original and themed weapons. The various features and elements make the adventure very close to a survival filled with mystery, terror and a lot of action.

Race against time to save humanity in a beautiful world made from the ruins of what was once the height of civilization. In Metro: Last Light Redux, adventure awaits in every new landscape or dark tunnel. Try this classic game completely revamped right now!

[b]One of the main strengths of the game is the immersion that the entire atmosphere of the Metro universe manages to create. The art direction of the game is impressive and brings true works of art to life in the most varied scenarios presented. Which is already a true evolution of its predecessor, since it is a considerably larger production.[/b]

There are not many changes regarding the gameplay, which was already, at its base, just another FPS. However, all the additional mechanics present in the previous game are still here, with the addition of certain improvements. The game suffers from an effect common to sequels to great games - the reduction in difficulty. But nothing that interferes with the gameplay experience.

Despite offering moments of difficulty and real challenge for the player, several elements of the game (such as shortage of ammunition), which serve to make it more difficult, seem softer. Even so, Metro offers modes with extremely high difficulty for players who really want the most hardcore experience possible.

The graphic quality also deserves mention. Although the original game already had much better graphics than the first title, they have been even more elaborate in this remastering and are ready to give work to the consoles of this new generation.

[b]In short, [i]Metro: Last Light Redux[/i] is a game that, like Metro 2033, cannot be missing from your library.[/b]

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",1678812639,1678812639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the most annoying parts are the game crashes that happen rarely, the auto-save in this also happens at some bad spots, if you are an explorer in your first playthrough

the DLCs are a tad hard but the most fun i had with the current weapons

the prequel is better in timing ...at saving the game.... IMO that was the most annoying part, graphics aren't great but it does create an atmosphere & it takes a while to get used to the mechanics for Filter switching, bit annoying that you cant grab ammo while switching your Filter, and Also if your filter switching gets bugged and you keep switching new filters, just reload the last checkpoint, BUT if you changed your filter and you are still gasping for AIR, take off your GasMask & put it back on... that should fix that bug, but yeah... some minor bugs.

if your gun doesn't shoot... it's probably because you are using the guns with a Pressure tank, best to avoid those are i think some (but i think there is a bug that makes all weapons stop shooting = reload last save, the game is short so no issues there) i also advise not using them for sniping but only with reflex sight aiming.

... the game wobbles too much and sometimes you are wobbling behind cover while being hit by bullets (that seem to be going through the map), because it has mechanics that work on a sort of timer... so you have to shoot then hide to the side of the map or you take dmg no matter what, there's no real indicator on when you are taking hits except this... invisible timing ...the blood on the sides of the screen, and the wobbling...like a drunken sailor, in a real situation you would see the snipers aiming at you  ...while 85% under cover...crouched down and unseen bullets are still taking you out. As well as rockets that pass overhead kill you still, like i said...unless you hide to the side of the map. 

i tried to be soft on this because i love the prequel, but this entire game annoys me on the first playthrough, lol... the 2nd playthrough is way more enjoyable. i got that OCD hoarding syndrome, but it's a fun game... knowing all of this hopefully makes you less annoyed with it, heh.",1666864110,1678788376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lastly but not less important, 99% of people will probably get the bad ending by design, that is not canon for the following game Exodus, this is complete bullshit, simply obligating the play stealth if they want to get the good ending is torture, and also because you'll have to play this shit storm all over again if what you want is the canon story.",1678589541,1678589541,False,3,0,0.481132060289382935,0,True,False,False

This game was better than the first, they fixed a lot of things that I didn't like about the first one. There's more boss fights and it's nice that the story picks up where it left off essentially. This game was definitely more creepy than the first, I was for sure spooked out in some of the darker/low visibility scenes. I liked that they played more on the use of light i.e the flashlight and shadows. 

I think that the story could benefit from having more variety in voice acting. Just like the first game the Nazi's have Russian accents. Everyone sounds the same as if there were only 3 voice actors. But again, better than the first game. I also wish they'd change the story rhythm up a bit.

Pro:
- Make you feel the game is twice bigger than Metro 2033
- Hard but not so much hard. It's mean that if you calculate every single bullet to use when shot a beast or bandit, you will be fine with ammo and filter.
- Not so hard to get good ending aka true ending (I got this on my first run too) as long as you enjoy every story in the game. Mercy is not neccessary to get good ending. Someone shot you you shot them back until they only have flesh not brain, someone drop gun and ask for mercy then you can spare them just like real life. It's simple and easy to understanding :) so dont be force yourself to restart everytime bandit  scream ""blyat"" at you and shot you like a Watchman anad just enjoy the game.
- B0B0 is good if you know what i mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Cons:
- Infamous crash loading because you die, it reload checkpoint but fail and that save file is corrupted. I suggest play that chapter from start instead of press continue and crash again.
- Some tiny minor graphic bug from metro 2033 but don't affect the game like lighter can spark RBG light (kinda cool :D )

So should you buy the game? No... Buy all the of them not buy only cuz why not? the game is good

Metro Last Light = Monsters + Nazis + Reds and virtually everything explained crystal clear up front within the first, IDK, 20mins or so of the game. What happened?

Real quick, I did NOT play this game for 41 hrs. I keep not understanding why some games do this.

The first game was a really good FPS with good weapons and a good story. This has some of that, and it's on the border of being recommended but it falls just short of that. The story is OK, its given to you all at once in the beginning and then slowly reintroduced to you over and over again as if discovering something for the second or even third time is this profound moment. It's also sad to see so many ""End of the World""/Horror cliches just thrown in for effect. So much so it's hard to make sense of it. Hands that come out of the ground to grab you, visions of the past, friends who betray you, crazy guy that somehow knows the truth from the beginning and lets not forget a good ole healthy dose of humanity can't stop killing and turning on each other even when its about to be completely wiped out. None of this is bad per say, and the main reason it gets a thumbs down is the gameplay at the end. The story is just not good enough to justify the sluggish boring take cover and shoot combat at the end. I'd say from the sniper ambush on to the end of the game the combat is just frustrating and bad. Don't we have enough FPS games where we kill Reds and Nazis? Isn't shooting monsters and barely escaping what made this game so good in the first place?

If you really want something like Metro 2033, but not this game, then I'd recommend Ashes 2063. Aside from that, I'd only recommend this if you have a high tolerance for frustrating mediocrity all in the name of seeing a few cutscenes probably available elsewhere. I've come this far so I guess I'll finish it begrudgingly but damn. Never again.",1678512121,1678512121,False,3,0,0.498098880052566528,0,True,False,False

It was more of glue-covered toilet paper. the game had a lot of new guns compared to 2033, but only really one of these guns was any useful. 

Also it had a lot of bugs and crushes (SERIOUSLY, HOW CAN ONE SELL A GAME WHICH CRASHES WHEN YOU UNPLUG YOUR HEADPHONES? DO YOU KNOW HOW FRAGILE JACK PORTS ARE?), some areas just broke and I had to restart the chapter. And these things aren't rare. The bigger problem is that often I don't even know if the game broke or if the devs put the path in the middle of nowhere and I can't find it. 

Also Arthom went have sex with a girl who he not only baerely knew, but who also was acting toxic as hell towards him. Seriously, wtf Arthom? Just an excuse to put another boob into the story. Wooo we got boobs. Would be nice if someone added an option to turn it off so people who don't want to see it don't have to and so streamers wouldn't get any problems.

There has never been a ranger in the real world that did not check and recheck his ammo, constantly. Stop with the idiot parade.

You'll never feel safer in the dark - This game is a masterclass in creating tension and suspense. Every corner you turn, you'll be wondering if you're about to be attacked by some mutated monster. But don't worry, you have a trusty flashlight to guide the way...if the batteries don't run out.

So many guns, so little time - Metro Last Light Redux has an impressive variety of weapons to choose from. Whether you want to go stealthy with a silenced pistol or go all-out with a flamethrower, there's a gun for every occasion.

The world-building is on point - The world of Metro Last Light Redux is rich with detail and lore. You'll encounter a variety of characters with their own stories and motives, and you'll learn about the history of the world through scraps of information scattered throughout the game.

The visuals are stunning - The game's graphics have been updated for the Redux version, and they are breathtaking. The environments are beautifully rendered, and the lighting effects create an eerie and atmospheric mood.

You'll never want to leave the tunnels - The game's setting, the underground tunnels of a post-apocalyptic Moscow, is one of the most immersive and engaging I've ever experienced. You'll find yourself getting lost in the dark, twisted tunnels for hours on end, and you won't even mind.

So there you have it, folks. Metro Last Light Redux is a must-play for any fan of post-apocalyptic shooters. Just make sure you bring a spare pair of pants, because this game is gonna scare the pants off you!",1677751807,1677751807,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Metro Last Light Redux - це продовження відомої гри Metro 2033 Redux, яка продовжує розповідь про життя людства після ядерної війни. Гра має глибоку та емоційну історію, яка переносить гравця в неймовірний світ постапокаліптичної Москви.

Пройшовши гру з поганим закінченням, я можу сказати, що це дуже сильний досвід. Хоча воно може здатися депресивним та безнадійним, але воно точно залишає враження. Гра змушує гравця думати про свої дії та їх наслідки, і показує, що не завжди можна знайти ідеальний вихід з ситуації.

Один з найбільших плюсів гри - це візуальна графіка, яка створює неперевершену атмосферу, а також звукове супроводження, яке доповнює досвід гри. Ігровий процес дуже захоплюючий та різноманітний, з багатою кількістю головоломок та бойових сцен.

Загалом, Metro Last Light Redux - це дуже захоплююча гра, яка залишить гравця з незабутнім досвідом. Хоча погане закінчення може викликати сумніви у гравців, але це варто пройти, щоб побачити, які можуть бути наслідки наших дій та вирішень.

Metro Last Light Redux is a sequel to the famous game Metro 2033 Redux, which continues the story of humanity's life after a nuclear war. The game has a deep and emotional story that transports the player to the incredible world of post-apocalyptic Moscow.

Having played through the game with a bad ending, I can say that it is a very strong experience. Although it may seem depressing and hopeless, it definitely leaves an impression. The game forces the player to think about his actions and their consequences, and shows that it is not always possible to find a perfect way out of a situation.

One of the biggest advantages of the game is the visual graphics that create an unparalleled atmosphere, as well as the soundtrack that complements the game experience. The gameplay is very exciting and varied, with a lot of puzzles and combat scenes.

Overall, Metro Last Light Redux is a very addictive game that will leave the player with an unforgettable experience. While the bad ending may leave players in doubt, it's worth going through to see what the consequences of our actions and decisions can be.",1677327698,1677327698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The redux is an updated version of the original Last Light that plays and holds up well against modern games.

as usual It's a narrative-focused role-playing game with a strong emphasis on the story, and it's the kind of game that allows you to completely immerse yourself in the world thanks to a lack of obtrusive HUD elements, which I would liken to Dead Space.

I didn't have any technical issues while playing through the game. The only issue I encountered was a bug where a boss became invincible in the garden mission. Other than that, it was a smooth and enjoyable experience.

To complete the game at 100%, you must complete the base campaign twice and each of the DLCs once. Each of the DLCs can be completed in around 20 to 30 minutes, so it's not that bad, and it all enriches the story and setting of Metro, with some of it building on what was established in the main game.

NOTE: Those who are afraid of spiders or may have arachnophobia should hold off buying. There are big spider-like creatures in the game. Do your own research to see if it's something you can handle.

While it's definitely recommended that you pick up this game, it's always wise to wait for a sale price.",1677269696,1677269696,True,5,0,0.575971722602844238,0,True,False,False

This is a great game in a (so far) great series. I've played Metro 2033 Redux and Metro Last Light Redux twice and am going to start Exodus soon. The games are linear, you just move forward through the adventure, there's no doubling back. 

If I have a gripe with these games, the no doubling back is definitely it. That, and the slow aim/look even on max sensitivity when using a controller. 

These games are best enjoyed when treating your experience like watching a movie. You're watching Artyom's adventure more than you are coming up with creative solutions to problems. 

That being said, it's an enjoyable movie. The games are wildly different from the books, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. A game of the books would be tedious and boring, while a book of the games would be nonstop firefights. They really do compliment each other well though.

The setting and narrative of Metro is truly captivating- crawling through ruined Underground tunnels where bullets are currency, stations are towns, and the Surface is a thrilling, dangerous risk is represented beautifully in Last Light Redux.  The narrative is also compelling, if somewhat lacking in dynamism.  Chapters are short, pacing is all over the place, but the themes and characters are mostly good.

That about ends the good in Last Light to me.  This game isn't exactly a buggy mess, but the bugs encountered are so egregious it made me quit the game mere hours before the finale.  First of all, the morality system as I understand it (which will determine which ending you get) is partially reliant on how many enemies you kill.  This is fine, but the stealth is pretty half baked and boring, and there's a glitch about halfway through the game that completely eliminates your ability to knock out enemies rather than kill them.  Secondly, over a dozen times Last Light would crash on startup, and while verifying the integrity of the game files fixed this for a few times, eventually I had to resort to uninstalling and reinstalling the game, and now even that doesn't fix it.  I don't enjoy this game enough to pursue this any more.

I think it's better than Metro 2033 as this one really has another level of depth put into it. There's much better level design here than in 2033, crouch and stealth mechanics work fine for the most part, the story is a lot more meaningful and has a better and more emotional development overall. The gameplay is pretty much the same with a few minor tweaks and some more gear variety. The side quests and activities are much more interesting this time around and carry more meaning than in the previous game, however, for some reason, the entire low chaos mechanic seems to be broken, as even by following online guides and killing only when necessary, giving free bullets to beggers, listening to dialogue,, avoiding unnecessary fights with monsters and overall using a stealth approach for the entire campaign still gives you the bad ending for some reason. The effort for it feels entirely wasted to be honest, and leaves me quite frustrated - enough for me not to play another campaign, even though I enjoyed the story and everything else.

The bad side about this game is that it crashes a lot. While I haven't experienced a single crash in Metro 2033, here I had almost 10 crashes throughout my run without any apparent reason.

Animator Andrii Korzinkin, who worked at developer 4A Games, has died following a combat mission in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The news was confirmed by designer Leonid Stepanov, who worked with Korzinkin at 4A on Metro Exodus before leaving to work at Remedy Entertainment.

""Andrii 'Nizrok' Korzinkin died while performing a combat mission in the struggle for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" wrote Stepanov. A talented animator, incredible person and real hero.""

Korzinkin began his animation career as a 3D animator at Ukrainian studio Pixelation, during which he worked on the TV series Angel Baby. In 2017, he entered the game industry as a senior animator for 4A as it was working on 2019's Metro Exodus. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, Korzinkin voluntarily enlisted into the Ukrainian military.

""Andrii was an awesome human being, very responsive and supportive, always ready to help, incredibly responsible and dedicated person,"" wrote 4A's technical designer Vitalii Keda.

Metro Last Light is one of those few games that manages to capture a gorgeous picture almost no matter where you are.
Whether it be the unforgiving metro tunnels, or the harsh Russian winter of the surface, nearly every level is incredibly well-crafted.

It has one of the most beautiful soundtracks I've had the pleasure of playing to, and the sound design is great.


Past this initial praise, I would however like to bring up an issue I noticed with the game, which may very well just be me.
It's too easy, much too easy.

What I mean by this is that not even on Survival Ranger Hardcore (Hardest difficulty availible), do I ever really feel like I'm struggling. Supplies are plentiful if you know the stash locations and don't forget to loot enemies, the only real issue I encountered was the cap on how much you could carry, which led to me having to abandon a fair amount of loot on each level.

What I personally think can (and should) be done to fix this, at least to some degree, is a custom difficulty level, where you have control over different variables that affect the game's difficulty. This would give players much more control over their experience, and could drastically improve most people's experience.

That being said, this game is an incredible experience, and I found myself playing it over and over again, even with the linear story. I really appreciated the moral system as well, while it may be a bit black/white as it is now, it's definitely a step in the right direction, and I can't wait to see what this talented studio does with Exodus.


TL;DR
Great game, go get it.

It's not just that the game's way overscripted, with lots of unskippable cut scenes, forced slow walking while some guy drops exposition, silly scare bits where you have to rapidly tap enter etc etc. 

It's that the story's pretty meh - I really didn't care much what happened - and when you finally do get to do some shooting, it's a pretty poor FPS - an extremely linear corridor shooter, with unsatisfying gun play and awful bullet sponge boss fights.

Survival and stealth improved, a little bit extra in the weapon department compared with the first one but if you are looking for a 1-2 tap and play both in sequence you'll probably just stick with the guns that carried you on the first game which I did. Sniper Rifle is useless except one mission (no spoiler), you can essentially transform your pistol in one with plenty of bullets that are even cheaper to build.

287390,131029494,76561198198962157,0,46,1679,0,689,1674683424,"Proceed with caution is probably the best way to describe Last Light. In one word: frustrating. Artistically frustrating.

There are some NSFW strong nudity sections that you can't skip. They're required to progress in the story. If you're a YouTuber or streamer you will get in trouble for sure if you show that on screen. FYI. I don't have a problem with that being in a game made for more mature audiences, but be warned, it's not skippable and these sections are required to continue playing past a certain point which is very frustrating. 

On top of that the enemy AI are extremely frustrating, they'll see you behind walls and kill you with the flick of an eyelash. Stealth is not really an option even when it seems like it would be normally in the previous game. But the worst part about this game is that it feels like a walking simulator. There are so many amazing set pieces and areas filled with beautiful detail that look incredible but you can't explore it because you're locked on rails like it's a Pokemon Snap game. So many quick time events that you can't avoid, and levels like Red Square and The Garden that make you want to slam your head into a brick wall because of how unfair it is, especially as the last few levels of the game where you feel like you're almost done and the game just punishes you with levels that will probably take you days to complete on their own. The game feels like it's punishing you for playing it because you can't complete the story once you get to these impossible road blocks. Normally, you would be rewarded for progressing in a game and reaching the end. Not in Last Light. The Red Square level makes me not even want to play this game ever again because it's all RNG luck and no matter what you do, you can't actually do anything about it except hope and pray the game blesses you with good RNG after a million times of restarting this one single fight, after hours and hours and hours of being stuck on one impossible mission. 

So many moments in this game where you're only option is to run around in circles like an idiot for 10minutes while you wait for an NPC to take a grandma-paced joy ride on a long drawn out sequence with wave after wave after wave after wave of of unkillable enemy hoards that you can't do anything about and simply have to wait your whole life for until it's finally over. It kills the immersion completely and the majority of the fun since this will be the experience you'll get for the majority of the game's missions. Fair warning.

I don't know why it's like that. The first game METRO 2033 didn't feel like that as much.

Like most people, I came for the survival horror exploration elements, and got a GTA-V-strip-club, Call-of-Duty-quick-time, Pokemon-Snap-on-rails hybrid with a Fallout stamp on it. You can't explore, you're stuck on rails. The AI and wave after wave after wave after wave of unkillable enemies that see like an eagle that you can't sneak past, quick time moments, walking simulator moments, and genuinely impossible levels like Red Square just make this game right on the edge of unbearable to play. 

I genuinely love the METRO series. I have played both METRO 2033 and METRO Last Light on the hardest difficulty (Survival Ranger Hardcore) two times each. I will definitely be playing 2033 again and can highly recommend that game. But Last Light on the other hand, I'm at a crossroads with. If you're a hardcore fan of the series, you'll want to finish this chapter of the story. But play on EASY difficulty. Trust me.

If you're a casual gamer looking for a fun experience into the METRO world, Last Light is NOT it. I recommend trying out METRO 2033 Redux and/or METRO Exodus first. Both of those games are amazing.",1673961440,1674751201,True,0,0,0.483193278312683105,0,True,False,False

Начну с технической части, графика стала гораздо лучше и картинка радует глаз, багов практически не было только провалы мёртвых тел через текстуры. Сама оптимизации осталось только хорошей. 

Геймплей в принципе не поменялся, за исключением добавление морального спектра в виде принятия решений убить или нет. Заметил разнообразие оружия которое предлагают. Игра по продолжительности стала дольше и сюжетно наполненной. Стоит отметить углубление в хоророр составляющею, игра стала страшнее и это радует.

Сюжет стал лучше во много раз, появилось больше локаций посещений где своя атмосфера и каждая из них живая. Неожиданно отметил для себя бар дель не видел чего-то такого со времён Дюка Нюкема, но здесь на вкус и цвет. Понравилось развитие двух сторон конфликта, что нацисты что красные не лучше вообще ни кто. Рад что Артём осознал свою ошибку убив чёрных, наконец здравый смысл посетил эту игру. Я только не оценил ветку отношений с Анной, типо виделись несколько раз не успели толком познакомиться и уже в кровать. Если брать подтекст того, что после войны мог вообще никто не выжить то это выглядит более логичным, но как симпатией я не проникся. 

По большей части проблема состоит в малом раскрытие персонажей, оно поверхностное и спасибо что перестали сливать их. А то в первой части просто одноразовые персонажи что не напарники то трупы.

Отдельно скажу про малыша чёрного, просто самое лучшее что есть в игре спасибо. Очень милый, а эти штанишки очень ему идут просто :3

Taking up the universe of the previous game, we find again the different factions, a good bestiary and once again a very good story. There is still the loot system where during the adventure you can find materials to improve your weapons in a complete way, you also have to manage the filter of your gas mask to be able to pass in some areas of the game.

The combat system is also very satisfying, as in the first one you can do it by shooting everything that moves or in infiltration with various equipment for the 2 styles of play. There are once again two different endings depending on the choices you make during your adventure.

It improves on the game-play in just about every single way from Metro 2033 and is a better game on almost every technical level. That being said, I feel it lacks the emotional core of the previous games story-line, instead going for a plot that feels both shallow and rushed.

It follows Artyom sometime after the events of Metro 2033's bad ending, i.e the canon conclusion. Without spoiling anything, the plot revolves around all the factions fighting for control over the D6 bunker which the Ranger faction now occupies after you discovered it at the end of the last game. The story will take you all across the metro all over again after an incident results in your capture and thus needing to re-link with your group.

It's fairly well paced, makes sense and motivations for the various factions are set-up early, however, its just not as engaging or interesting this time around imo. The factions have always been pretty one-note in the Metro series, hence why they're background and weren't the main focus of the last game. It really just comes down to the typical good faction/bad faction. This is fine as light context for a factions personality, but when you make these factions are a core part of the plot, I felt like more nuance was needed. Even the characters feel simplified this time around with the exception of a couple. Anna in particular is a massive missed opportunity. In this game in particular, her introduction and inclusion in the narrative is done incredibly poorly. She has no long-form and natural character arc, she kinda just completely changes her personality each time you see her until she becomes your half-arsed love interest. It just felt lazy.

Thankfully, everything else is an improvement.

Graphics wise, the game still looks amazing to this day, although the redux probably helps. The environments and weather effects in particular when you're up top look insanely good. The lighting is also a standout with some nice god rays and particle effects. Overall this game is still a knockout in the graphics department.

The game is also very polished. Running it maxed out at 1440p, it runs flawlessly the whole time with no stutters and the game was basically bug free the whole time.

In game-play, Last Light aims to polish the predecessor and it succeeds very well. Gunplay feels great thanks to both the good hit feedback as well as the stellar sound design. There are more weapons here than the previous game and they're far more modifiable than before. Stealth actually works properly now and is more fleshed out, allowing you to play most of your human encounters like its metal gear. Proper boss-fights are included more often now, however they are pretty standard and don't add all that much.

The difficulty levels return in full also. I played through the entire game this time on Hardcore Ranger Mode, the hardest difficulty and it was quite a challenge. For the most part, it was very fair but every so often you'd run into a section where it clearly wasn't designed for this challenge and the game would kick my ass. I wouldn't recommend this difficulty for your first experience however, seeing as it removes all hud elements including the quicktime prompts, meaning if you don't know them already, you'll fail them over and over again.

It about the same length as the previous game, both taking me just over 7 hours to beat on the hardest difficulty. It's not gonna' blow you away in the story department, but its incredibly fun, immersive and there's nothing out there quite like the Metro series. These games go on sale for dirt cheap all the time, so please check them out when you can, they're great shooters.",1600954721,1674015552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The plot of the game is same good. The game is a direct continuation of 2033 and without knowing what is happening in the first part - it is very difficult to understand the second. We may see how character develops. His fluctuations in terms of morality, which we commit by certain actions. And all this in a compartment gives us 2 endings, as in the prequel.

I remember how fans were discussing that good ending may be myth, because it was really hard to get it. I played game twice - first in 2014 after the release and second time the console version. Both times I couldn’t achieve the good ending.

The game showed us totally new version of the Metro universe. The game stopped to be such dark and scary as has been 2033. Last light is more cheerful, we may see flashbacks from the time before apocalypse. And the universe has developed, from the very beginning we get to know about new clans that oppose us. Gameplay became much easier and less hardcore - if previous Metro 2033 always tempted you to go into stealth, the Metro Last Light gives you an ability to choose. Personally me in both parts always decided to go into direct confrontation and choose more shooter and less stealth. 

I enjoyed the Metro Last Light, the game is exactly the same as the prequel, but at the same time completely different. Those who loved the gloom of the Metro 2033, in Last Light it will be very much missed, as was for me. But all the disadvantages that can be seen during the play do not spoil the overall impression of the passage, even after so many years after the release of the game.",1673697122,1673697122,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Ok so I finished this game right after having finished Metro 2033 so this review is gonna be based on my experience following a order. Also on Ranger difficulty same as the first game.

So I think I enjoyed this game way more than I did enjoy the first Metro. The story here is a lil more complex with a lot of plot twist's to understand that will get you engaged af. While in the first game you just GO CRAZY about the Dark Ones and almost EXTERMINATE their entire race just because people believe that they are evil and worse than any other kind of creature out there in Metro: Last Light you have a way more well constructed story and characters motivations to actions, it's not as nonsense as the first game.

No words to describe the characters and your relationships with them, this game was made to make you feel like you are friends with them that shit is amazing. 

The only negative point I got it's the pacing of the game, the first hours are nicely entertaining but the last hour of the game is just a pain in the ass OMG. The resources just go almost nonexistent and it's the same thing killing Watchmen and Lurkers running from Shrimps in the rain and it doesn't stop raining. The fight with the Bear is very easy to go through and pretty cool, not bad, same thing for the first boss.
This is what keeps me engaged with the Metro Series 'cause even when the game can be a pain in the ass it rewards you with chill moments of character development and cozy ambience just walking around some station watching people interact with the world and you.

Well if you like the post-apocalyptic post-soviet russian shooter survival horror tactical genre Metro: Last Light is definitely worth EVERY cent you spend with it. I'd recommend it to everyone.",1673271680,1673271692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed nearly all of the base game. There's also a lot of DLC included, but after trying the infuriating Faction Pack Heavy level, I ended up skipping most of the rest except for the story-based Chronicles Pack levels.

Most notes below are largely relative to 2033 Redux:

[h1]The Good[/h1]
+Proper explanation of most mechanics!
+Mission objectives almost (*) always clear!
+Ability to test a number of guns at the start!
+Less point-blank fights against hordes of mobs!
+More guns
+More enemy types
+Can still replay chapters
+Still lots of difficulties
+More engaging and understandable story
+Some likeable and returning NPC's

[h1]YMMV[/h1]
~Slightly more FPS gameplay vs survival of 2033
~Intro cutscene can be skipped with Use key, but this isn't documented
~Semi-hidden morality system still exists
~Couple of counter-intuitive morality results
~Really need ability to drag bodies
~NPCs still talk over one another. Subtitles on everything would be nice.
~Early periods of visceral violence, nudity, frequent references to rape
~Alerted enemies make everyone nearby instantly omniscient
~Few areas where stealth is very difficult
~Hard to finding the right spot where corpses are lootable
~Backstabbing mutants is unpredictable

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
-Checkpoint save system still sucks for stealth or short play times
-Still can't read journal entries if you bound 'F' elsewhere

So let's cover all the basics: what feels like 70% of this game possibly more is reused assets from Metro 2033, it's in the same engine with little iteration, and while some aspects feel like 4A had a bit more of a budget to work with, I hated Last Light by the end.

While the gunplay and shooting in Metro 2033 are what I would call adequate or serviceable, they are inadequate in this game particularly when you spend a significantly larger portion of the game shooting guys. Combat engagements in this game don't actually feel terribly fun, and the developers leaned HARD into the 'stealth-oriented gameplay' playstyle that was possible in the first game, to the point where I am sure you could play this game as a traditional shooter and skip all stealth - but it'd be ABSURDLY hard because this time around the game is extremely stingy with resources.

Keys and safes in the first game, while it felt like a cute little bonus basically for fully exploring an entire area, is something that I basically just lost patience with in playing this game, but safes as it happens are also one of the most important sources of loot. The key placements are haphazard and bizarre, just like the balance of ammunition the game awards you with, and particularly when you're fighting against the clock (and your filter count, which fortunately is something the game is NOT stingy) it's a bad feel running around getting increasingly frustrated asking WHERE IS THE KEY while you search a room for the sixtieth time. So I hated that.

The enemy variety in this game is just the same as the first, except I guess maybe people complained about a lack of bosses, so this game has like 8 bosses and all of them are fairly dull and basically the same idea over and over and they have bizarre extremely difficult to avoid attacks, and at least one boss can't be dodged at all from what I could tell. The game also definitely doesn't adequately prepare you for bosses, especially given you can on at least one occasion see back-to-back bosses!

Your weapon selection this time is a little more rigid, since ammo is scarce now, money is definitely scarce, and there is a massive surplus of shotgun shells, so you best hope you can fit a shambler or whatever in your loadout. The sniper rifle is completely worthless and it was basically a wasted slot for almost my entire playthrough, and it seems to me a great example of a noob trap that looks like it might be useful against bosses, but then when you fight them they don't seem to take nearly as much damage from it as they do from, say, a pipebomb. So you end up carrying around a useless weapon you're saving for a boss or whatever that can't be suppressed so you don't really want to use it against humans, and only VERY rarely has ammo available for it. So I didn't enjoy this either.

I also was not happy with some of the developments in the story, and it even felt like there were bizarre choices made with regards to how the story opens, what it takes from the first game, and it even feels like they retconned a few things, basically, to patch up holes in the original narrative?

Last Light was released in 2013, too, so honestly even at the time it felt a little bit dated, given the engine at this point was at least 3 years old and hadn't received any major tune-ups. While it's not terrible, it feels a lot like a DLC project that got too big and was turned into its own game.

Oh also I should mention, this game significantly tones down the supernatural, mysterious qualities of Metro 2033, explains many of them, introduces one or two new baffling things that AREN'T explained, and then humanises 'The Dark Ones' to the point where you completely understand them and then suddenly the entire sense of wonderment and mystery is completely lost which is a crippling blow the game and the game's setting cannot recover from, because suddenly everything seems mundane and crude. 

The game loses a LOT from the absence of the mystique of the Metro, particularly because you are then just subject to the dull earthly qualities of humans shooting at other humans. And it is boring.

I would not recommend this game unless you maybe LOVED Metro 2033 and just thought the gameplay was the most riveting stuff ever, because I don't think the story is really well developed or compelling this time around. It's not terrible but I did not have a good time playing it, there were too many segments that were frustrating, annoying, or tedious for me to really love it.",1673020955,1673059012,False,1,1,0.478087633848190308,0,True,False,False

The way they rule out who gets the bad and good ending is very... unfair? See, you must save the Bear, don't kill Letsnitsky and Pavel, remove the mask, explore and interact with people, give the teddy bear to the kid crying, save the Prisoners, save the Caravan, and just listen on some conversation. Though, Letsnitsky deserved to die plus I have no feelings towards him, never once had any care, while I saved Pavel cause I actually had some emotion towards him, and he was full of sadness, not anger says the little one, so I believed he can have one more chance. The bear being saved is just stupid, how would we know to do that? The Teddy one is simple, since you actually have a loud dialogue tell you if you simply just snoop around a bit. Overall, this game is great, but the ending choices are wayyyy to strict, If i want to legitimately get the whole ending, without watching a youtube video (of course I watched the video on the good ending) then I would have to replay the game from nearly the start. Its a great ruling for a person who is kind and doesn't engross themselves in this game, but its a game of death, I'm killing those who don't deserve it or I'm saving those who I have emotional attachment to. If I have no attachment to it, it attacks me because its defending its kids, yet I'm no where near them, why have me save it since I personally shouldn't have any emotional attachment to it.

i fucking love realism and  atmosphere of late cold war era frostpunk universe, a pretty good story and an immersive world combined with, surprisingly, pretty good gameplay (only complaint is the lack of Q/E lean movements and  no prone, that would benefit the game on harder difficulties)
The aspects I enjoyed the most about this title are the world building and story as metro captures it so amazingly.. Trudging underground to several human outposts / colonies is great and exploring the colonies themselves were my favorite part of the game. The imagination on display here is top notch. Seeing how people survive underground was awesome from the farms and how generated electricity , to windmills that produce electricity on the surface (Can be seen in metro exodus at Army base at beginning of the game)
The gunplay is pretty solid, but as said before on metro 2033 review, lack of Q/E lean and prone /crouuched movements.I enjoyed toying with and modding the weapons and testing out all the possibilities as gun customsation is close to that of fallout 4 the sheer gun variety in this title for the AK74M, and the RPK74M. There are many cramped and intense moments underground wish sheer eye to detail environmental storytelling but there are also a few overworld levels that are also quite intense.

This game like any of other metro is rollercoaster of fast paced action usaully 3-4 missions before you can take a breathe of relief in a one of stations that are friendly to you. when the rest comes its well earned, finding sanctuary, even at church in the first and this game, brings relief, very fitting . It is suspenseful and stressful and has the Dayz/stalker feel of looking around, scanning your surrounding consistently and constantly.  If you enjoy linear, single player  FPS  experiences that are immersive center around ammo conversation/ bullet rariety, metro is a great game.
This isnt a game you will be spraying your ak mag dumping unless you are panicked or a easier difficulty.

- Very atmospheric and good looking
- Accommodates for a number of different playstyles and approaches to all encounters
- The story is pretty ok and has multiple endings
- [spoiler] Anna [/spoiler] is the only poorly developed and uninteresting character

Metro: Last Light is a survival game first and foremost, so play on higher difficulties. Supplies are often in shortage so every combat encounter has a lot of weight to it.

Combat is tactical but stealth feels too forgiving, since the player character has much better dark vision then the npcs which is something I really don't like. I recommend turning down your gamma to the third or fourth lowest level. That way you actually need to use your flashlight and nvg.

There's a really unfair boss battle at one point.

The story is rather predictable from the beginning, but it's still worth paying attention since there are plenty of smaller details, especially in casual npc dialogue.

It’s my personal taste, I just don’t like the entire Metro series, I play this series only because I like FPS game and Metro is 3A FPS game. But It just so different from other shooter games: 80% the time you are in a dark underground place fighting monsters, its post apocalypse environments are ugly. I just don’t like this kind of game, Maybe you do In fact many people do, they think Metro is one of the most impressive and immersive shooter out there.

This game wants you to play stealthy, but it has a very bad and inconsistent stealth system. Sometimes, I walk right under enemies’ nose, they can’t see you. Sometimes the enemy walks right pass his dead buddy, and they don’t care and do nothing.  But sometimes, you are hidden in the dark and above enemies, somehow they can see you and everyone starts shooting you.  You don’t know who spotted you, because this game doesn’t show you such information. Very bad and inconsistent stealth system.

I just couldn't like this game, Metro Exodus is the only  Metro game I enjoyed, because Metro Exodus steered away from Metro 2033 and Last Light. Metro Exodus goes outside, the environment not always dark, weapons are more enjoyable to use. If you only played Metro Exodus, and want to try out the first 2 Metro games, you may not like Metro 2033 and Last Light, but in those 2, Last Light is better.

This game sucks, I played it on ranger mode an while the stealth aspect is ok, the areas out in the open or fighting mutants is a game ruiner.

1. Linear gameplay - go from point A to B
2. Cheap enemies, mainly the mutants. They gang up on you and are bullet sponges. What's worse is the MAGICAL bad timing, the split second I'm reloading or putting on a mask, WOW there they are, bam bam bam I'm dead. 
3. Crappy realistic guns that run out with swarms of foes all over you, you will die again an again because you are busy reloading, trying to heal or switching guns. 
4. Cheap boss fights because of 1-3
5. Filters for the mask die out way too fast. My menu said I had 15 minutes..............I counted, it was more like 30 seconds to a minute. Yknow, why can't they figure out a way for me to enjoy the scenery outside, instead it's RUSH RUSH RUSH. Why bother even making the levels, no ones going to enjoy them. 
5. Got so sick of having these annoying check points save with me with ZERO filters left, so I had to always restart the entire chapter an speed run my way through already knowing where everything was. 
6. No go zones - Well this looks like I can skirt along this way O wait, invisible wall, instant death, etc, etc. Yet there are areas you can go you dont think you can go so you are always second guessing.
7. Horrible fast action paced FPS but with ""realistic guns & physics"". These games are supposed to be about survival an resource management, yet they ram hard hitting FPS action in my face but hamper me with this BS. Trying to fight a boss but everything is going wrong because my guns are empty, I can't see because it's too dark, controls are clunky & overly complicated. They dont' give you the option to sneak past the boss or to deal with the situation with smarts rather than brawn. It let's you play stealthy one moment...................then shoves you into a cage fight to get royally creamed. 
8. Annoying auto-saves which works horribly, nothing I like better than reloading all my guns an getting stuff over & over because I hit the auto save before resetting all my gear, then die because I'm right before a boss fight or hard spot.
9. Bugs & glitches - My sprint button stopped working permamently for some odd reason. Plenty of other bugs too like this. Like I'm gasping for air in an area that doesn't need a mask. These glitches can't be fixed, you have to restart the entire chapter if they show up.
10. Un-beatable epic fights that are CHEAP AF. the worse is the ambush, you have snipers all over you, an they send a bunch of guys after you, an it's un-winnable. Even if you know where everyone is, an plan the game CHEATS, an that's what this game does all the time, CHEAT. I put up mines where all the enemies would show up, I sniped the snipers getting three before things even started, an it was BS cause they were BULLET SPONGES, I was smashing them with headshots an they just shrugged it off O BUT they kill me literally instantly. An then to top it all off, suddenly the ground guys started shooting rockets at me, while that annoying ""see through stuff"" vision was on. An they were INSANELY bullet spongey, wtf.
11. Just drags on, they literally have you do the same thing over & over & over, to the point ""O look a safe key, yeah I dont' care, nothing in those safes I need anyway."" By the time the game is almost finished you are just ramming through the levels as fast as possible cause you are just sick of it
12. This is a big one, but it's ""game dev rigged"" game play. Example, the ""knife throwing"" system is absolute trash, I lost count how many times I missed someone by 0.00025 inches. it's insane an it's obvious they programmed that in so you don't run around knifing everyone. That's what they did, they sabotaged an NERFED the mechanic so it didn't get over used. When I toss a knife an it misses by a nanometer, an then I adjust an throw again an it goes exactly like the first one, then yknow they programmed it like that. Any gamer hates game devs who program win or lose like that, from ""auto-aims"" to enemies not attacking or attacking harder based on data. Either hand holding or deliberate sabotage to make things way harder than it should have been. It was very obvious during the train ride where I had to shoot the rail car enemies, an I KNeW I was putting shots on them but I was missing an dying a lot. Well I recorded a video an watched it in slow motion, an that's what I do when I sense something is off cause I'm really good at ""hip shooting"" in video games. Well I counted, 1, 3, 5 shots that clearly landed on the body, an did NOTHING, O but when I zoom in an go for a head shot, that's the only time they register. So the devs rigged it so unless you AIM through the sights, the hit box on enemies gets SMALLER while it's the opposite when you aim through the sights, the hit box gets BIGGER. RIGGED!

Clearly this game was puked out for the Call of Duty crowd, it's nothing like the first game. This is a game series that was supposed to let the player play the game ""their way"" but it won't let you when fighting mutants. 

Am I playing an Action based FPS or a survival game ? Pick one
I've played HARD games an games with SUPER HARD mode, an the golden rule is, if the control is solid, if the enemies don't CHEAT an they give you a fair chance, then it's good. This game CHEATS. One moment enemies go down with a few ""broad"" hits to the torso, an then they are shrugging off head shots an turn into bullet sponges.

Ok so gottah say something good.

1. Mature content for a mature world - Yes we have strippers an all that, nudity. That's really the few sell points of these games, they don't censor an yet don't shove it in there just to up the edge factor. It fits for the world you are in.
2. Story is excellent.........if you don't mind the fact they went with the BAD ending in Metro 2033, that pissed me off.
3. All the writing & story has stayed good.

Yeah, that's about it, so basically you can watch a youtube ""game movie"" of Metro Last Light an enjoy it but you won't like actually playing it. 

After Metro Exodus, this will be the last game I buy from this lousy company. I don't care if they sell it on steam on sale for $1",1536473066,1672446463,False,2,0,0.385484844446182251,0,True,False,False

Действие Metro: Last Light происходит в том же постапокалиптическом мире, что и в предшественнице, и начинается с того момента, на котором остановилась первая игра. Вы снова будете играть за Артема, выжившего человека, который борется за выживание в руинах Москвы. Но на этот раз ставки еще выше, ведь вам предстоит раскрыть правду о таинственном устройстве Судного дня.

Одна вещь, которая действительно отличает Metro: Last Light, - это улучшенный стелс-геймплей. Независимо от того, пробираетесь ли вы мимо вражеских патрулей или уничтожаете их незаметно, стелс-механика плавная и интуитивно понятная. А благодаря разнообразию оружия и улучшений в вашем распоряжении боевые действия никогда не становятся скучными.

The graphics and the gameplay is 99% the same like the first Metro. Sometimes a bit too messy when many monsters or enemies but still viable. There are few new weapons and the new chapters to play and see the Metro world through the eyes of other characters. Nice shooting experience although only in streamlined levels, no open world or at least ""district-like"" maps. However a must play for Metro fans and a very nice experience for FPS-survival fans. Bugs seems to be better in this game. I have not experienced any weird glithces or crashes in the main campaign, only in the developer level. My rating:

Some people prefer the style of the original Metro 2033 over Last Light and 2033 Redux but i personally think you can't go wrong in any way when picking a version to play, as long as you play the series sequentially. While not necessary, playing 2033 or its Redux first will give you some knowledge of your character, the other characters in Last Light and the state of the world in this universe.

So why is this one the ""weak"" link of the series?
The story is a bit overambitious, balancing three major plot threads in conjunction with each other that eventually meet near the end the form the whole picture in a way that can feel a little confusing and cumbersome. Without spoiling too much, the importance of the young Dark One, the D6 substation where the Rangers (the player's faction) occupy, and the villains plot all flip flop around enough to where the context of each level can feel a little muddy--""are you looking for the Dark One or working against the villain this level?"" is a question you'll encounter a few times.
that said, the story is still quite good, with well written faction relationships,  interesting characters, a sorta believable/well acted romance, etc. It can get predictable sure, but it should keep you invested during a few playthroughs. Again, it works best as a sequel to 2033, as characters and scenarios from that game are mentioned and this game's story operates as a near-immediate sequel.

Gameplay wise, i think most people will point out its immersive qualities. Survival in the Metro is relatively straight forward, be stealthy-save ammo, avoid mutants if possible, etc, but the surface levels are saturated in radiation, meaning a gas mask and appropriate filter time is needed to traverse. Luckily, even on the Ranger Modes, survival is never too hard as long as you explore; you don't need to hit every nook and cranny, but you'll find bodies with ammo littered everywhere, stashes of ammo, meds, filters, etc are in safes and those safes are never too far from their keys visible by a red ribbon. Similar to its predecessor and its successor, Metro Exodus, there are ""moral points"" scattered around levels for doing certain things. Plenty of these are tied to exploration, so if you look around thoroughly, you should have no trouble getting the ""good/canon"" ending. Other moral points are tied to clear moments of choice, like choosing to forgive or kill a certain character, or killing a surrendering enemy. 

My favorite aspect of this game, and by extension each other Metro game, is how levels flow together and are given enough context through the narrative to feel like a real Odyssey. Artyom (you) never just skips past entire sections to get to the next story beat, rather each story beat involves getting to the next one and traversing large amounts of ground is part of working each level. This definitely adds to the immersion as your loadout and such from one level persists into the next and such.

The worst things about this game are largely related to its survival mechanics. For example, it is POSSIBLE to soft lock yourself on a surface level with no way out if you dont have enough filter time. stuff like this is avoidable as long as you explore thoroughly, but its still a possibility. The other worst thing is that there are like 2 difficulty spikes relating to ""boss mutants"" in later levels that could potentially halt progress as well. 

It'll take somewhere between 12-16 hours to beat the game once and thats without doing any of the DLC chapters that are included.",1671244216,1671244216,True,1,0,0.500387191772460938,0,True,False,False

Metro: Last Light Redux is a post-apocalyptic survival shooter game that was released in 2014 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Developed by 4A Games, it is a reimagined and remastered version of Metro: Last Light, which was initially released in 2013. The game is set in the year 2034 in post-apocalyptic Moscow, Russia, where the player must survive against mutated creatures, hostile humans, and a hostile environment.

The game focuses on a group of survivors who live in the underground metro system in Moscow. The player takes control of Artyom, a young man who is struggling to find a way to save his species from extinction. As he travels through the metro, he learns of a conspiracy involving a powerful weapon and the mysterious Dark Ones. He must also face the dangers of the surface world, where mutated creatures and hostile humans are a constant threat.

Gameplay in Metro: Last Light Redux is a combination of first-person shooter and survival horror. Players must traverse the underground metro system in search of weapons, ammunition, and supplies while fighting off hordes of mutated creatures and hostile humans. Players can also scavenge the environment for supplies such as food and medical supplies. Artyom also has the ability to craft makeshift weapons and gadgets from the scrap he finds.

The game also includes a new Ranger Mode, which is a more difficult version of the game. In Ranger Mode, players have limited ammunition and supplies, and must scavenge more frequently to survive. There is also an alternate ending in Ranger Mode, which provides a more satisfying conclusion to the game.

The visuals and audio in Metro: Last Light Redux are stunning. The environments are detailed and immersive, and the lighting effects are particularly impressive. The soundtrack is also excellent and provides a great atmosphere.

Overall, Metro: Last Light Redux is an excellent game that offers an intense and thrilling post-apocalyptic experience. The visuals, audio, and gameplay are all top notch, and the Ranger Mode provides an extra layer of challenge for those looking for a more difficult experience. Metro: Last Light Redux is an excellent game that is well worth playing for fans of post-apocalyptic survival shooters.

The gun play is really good, perhaps not comparable to the best shooters out there, but the controls are responsive and there's a decent arsenal to choose from. You can also customize your weapons to make them suit your preferred style of play better.

The story is pretty engrossing, even though the characters seem pretty one dimensional at times, and their motivations are somewhat questionable from time to time.

Story-wise, Gameplay Mechanics, Puzzle and Objectives, and DLC for more appreciation points for this game. 
The game is definitely a recommended for anyone and it is really good. I don't want to be specific, but if you are looking for a game that is related to how people deal with post-apocalyptic worlds I'm sure this is not a waste of time. However, it still depends on the visuals and gameplay if you are up to it. 

The game can be easy or difficult depending on the situation and mode of difficulty played. Try playing ranger gamemode for realistic gameplay because it is a challenge for simulating the character's experience.
Unless all of these features didn't appeal to you, it is still up to you to try. Just check gameplays on YouTube to know what to expect for visual reference and combat system. Personally, I like the stealth mechanic of this game so maybe that can be one of the genres you are looking for.",1669545434,1669545434,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

[spoiler]that is, if you got the 'bad ending'... which is actually the 'good ending' (confusing, I know).[/spoiler] As you know by now from the previous game, you can either choose action or stealth in your playthrough, but your choices have consequences. Nothing big - because NPCs will treat you the same regardless - but it does determine your ending. Again, you get these subtle 'moral points' for 'doing the right thing' and even a penalty if you do not do 'the right thing'. This time it is less obscure than in the previous game. Regardless, you should play the game however you like without worrying about these 'moral points' (although, if you have not figured it out by now, this game is trying to teach you something...).

Contrary to the previous game, I felt that the gas mask filters situation was a lot better. I still almost ran out of air a few times, but I always made it (or maybe I just got better at filter management, haha). Selecting stuff from my inventory was a lot clearer now too. Everything just felt a lot smoother. The interactions with certain NPCs are also a lot more dynamic. There was one in particular that really grew on me (and I am sure on a lot of other people as well).

From all three Metro games, Metro: Last Light has the most DLC and there is quite a bit of it. It ranges from blasting through enemies with your weapons of choice, from a few stories where you take control of Artyom's friends to glue some missing pieces together, to a really cool scavenger level and, ugh... spiders. Oh, how those spiders in the Metro series freak me out...

Overall, I highly recommend this game. I had a thrill ride right from the beginning all the way up until the end! :-)

Story is pretty cool. Light Sci-Fi themes, post apocolyptic setting with linear levels.

Shooting feels good and the extra mechanics are integrated nicely into the gameplay, like shooting lights to hide better and starting fires by shooting lanterns.

Replay value is pretty high since there's two modes; Ranger and Spartan. I did Ranger because I like a more technically challenging game, but I will definitely come back and play Spartan for a more balls out shooter.

Screw the ending tho. I found out there's a good ending and i tried with a guide to get it, but still got the regular ending, so don't go in with that expectation because it actually made me a little bit upset that I wasted my time.

I miss it but I can see the benefits in focusing on the human characters more, and the child near the end is worth the wait in adding characterization to an enemy whose personality felt empty in substance in the last story. It's still an exciting story, but in its own way through a greater focus on human optimism. I see it in how the stations feel more alive, the refined morality system especially rewarding mercy, and the side conversations not rooted in cheap sentimentality but humanism. 

There are a few misteps, with Anna's romance rushed, Khan losing his cool till it feels out of character, some damage sponge enemies, the level design not being intuitive in telling you which path is side content and which will lock you out by leading you to the next area, and the conspiracy narrative becoming a bit convoluted in the middle. 

Still, I think I prefer this one between the first two.

The combat is improved, guns feel more believable and real now, and there are more. I've done 2 playthroughs and enjoyed using different weapons on both. The music is once again awesome. 

The downside is that the game is more buggy than before. It kept crashing or freezing, and the levels take quite a long time to load for me. These are only really small things, though.

New boss fights that are really full mutants, not like the first one where it was mostly horde/massive enemies or rail shooter moments. Once again, play Hardcore Ranger difficulty. Compared to the first one, I recommend the Spartan mode because the game seems to have been designed for this mode. I found myself many times in situations where stealth was impossible because the enemies saw you too much or even while looting and looking around, I had a very big lack of ammunition that made me get stuck on certain levels.

Every aspect of game play was improved from the first, the story was immersive and compelling and kept me hooked throughout the whole game.

The story is very unique and original as the plot unfolds in way that I've never seen in an 'Post-Apocalyptic' genre. It really manages to embed a memorable experience. Basically the story follows up a year after the first game and you go through another journey with Artyom as he finds the truth about the dark ones and how he can seek forgiveness or at least find some closure for what he did to the dark ones home, since he now knows that what he did was wrong and that the dark ones were no real threat.  

Highly recommend this game, like the previous one.",1667048928,1667048928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its got the same mechanics, atmosphere, gameplay etc. Its got extra boobies though so that a plus. Theres a couple of extra weapons in this game but no much else is different apart from the story. I cant decide which is better as I enjoyed the whole thing as one experience having played them back to back. 

This one has some extra included DLC where you play as different characters whom you meet through the main game which was real nice to flesh out a little more of the story even though they were quite short. Seriously though f@ck the Tower DLC haha, that made me sweat and my OCD would not allow me to leave it uncomplete as theres an achievement for finishing it even though it has nothing to do with the main story.

Some very annoying bugs popped up where I couldnt progress in a level as it kept crashing to desktop and I had to restart the whole level. This happened me twice. Other than that it was an almost flawless experience from start to finish. Highly recommended. 

I got these games for about 2 bucks each on sale. Amazing value for money.

The sequel feels exactly like its predecessor in terms of graphics, and gameplay, however, what makes it better - the level design. As always the chapters are quite linear and you don't deviate much from the fixed path, but the world is filled with beautiful details, astonishing views of the desolated land and is pretty lively considering the setting. Hats off for the flashbacks that cut you deep and put you in the mood for the full submersion.

What I love and admire is that the story is not forced on you but it's made in the way that you enjoy it and your finger doesn't accidentally slip on the skip button.

Outside the main story you have some additional missions that are pure gold and send you back to the locations of Metro 2033.

Overall, Metro: Last Light feels like an improvement that will be an enjoyable experience. The only decision that you need to make is whether to be a sneaky snake or a killing machine.",1666475348,1666475348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every aspect of the first Metro game has been enhanced and improved in every aspect, from gameplay to graphics. My review is more of a recap of my own experiences and opinions of the game, not really a review that helps a decision in purchasing the game or not. Well I do recommend it if you're looking for some random sign to buy the game lol
Spoilers ahead.

First, the stealth is vastly better than before. Levels are designed to allow for a more polished and enjoyable stealth approach, and you can knock enemies out by pressing a button prompt when behind an enemy instead of the weird punching attack that rarely worked in the first game (unless I was doing it wrong the entire time, then uh oops). Shooting out / turning off lights was fun, and watching enemies react to the lights being turned off was cool. They always did this weird slow walk when they're alerted, and they inch around in the dark like snails.

Gameplay is a lot more improved. Hard to describe, but it is definitely better in some way. 

What I think is the most improved is the graphics. The graphics in Metro LL is absolutely fantastic. The crowded metro areas have some truly extravagant lighting and attention to detail, and are so full of life. The lighting in Metro LL is one of the best I have ever seen. The surface, the destroyed buildings in the distance, underground caves, abandoned buildings and locations, even the most insignificant of hallways, sewers, and rooms were beautiful. I have so many scenic screenshots of the most mundane of places because they are so pretty to look at. My favorite area in the game is the beginning of the level where you follow the small Dark One through a train depot of some sorts. The atmosphere and rain reminded me of STALKER, although I also like the area on its own, not just because it reminded me of the STALKER games. I love the lighting in this game, it's probably the best I've ever seen in any game I've played. Environments in this game are awe inspiring.

Sound design and art design are all great, just wanted to bring up them up to say they are good. UI design, as well. I love the Metro games and their diagetic UI design.

What I really have to commend is the overall level design. I am glad that the Metro series is a linear story series kind of game, because I think the greatest strength of the series is its level design. The series is known for its cool weapons and gas mask aesthetics, along with the mutants and the underground metros, but those are all there to enhance the true draw of the Metro games. Exploring the levels and the creepy hand crafted areas of horror was awesome. I expected random mutant jumpscares here and there, of course, but the best horror parts was when it was more atmospheric and tense, letting your surroundings tell the story. Yeah, the ghost room during the railcar level took me by surprise. And those skeleton guys behind the grating, damn them. I think I remember seeing those guys show up on ""top ten scary moments in video games"" lists when I was younger.

Story was interesting. I got the good ending, though I was following a guide to avoid getting the bad ending. I don't really play the Metro games for the story, but I do enjoy it.

I beat this game in two days. I spend an entire day playing the game up until the last five levels, and that was because I stopped myself from playing further. I enjoyed this game a lot, and I think I prefer it over Metro 2033. Metro 2033 was great up until the final few levels in D6, and it unfortunately left a bad impression on me even though I did enjoy the first and middle segments of the game a lot. It's what I remember the most when I think back to 2033, and even if I try to remember the good parts I thoroughly enjoyed, it is still affected by those last levels. Still a good game, though.
For Metro Last Light, I pretty much enjoyed every second of it. I ran into a few mishaps, like the game needing to be validated because it kept crashing in the beginning, and at one point my computer crashed and it somehow unbinded all my keys, but those were fixed. I like this game a lot, evident by my playing through the whole thing in just two days.

Looking forward to Metro Exodus. Thank you for a great game!",1666389519,1666394079,True,2,0,0.525080084800720215,0,True,False,False

Story is better than 2033 in my opinion, especially the ending and general cut-scenes. Feel like there's much more intrigue and mystery in this story. However, there are still parts that are very confusing as to where to go and what to do, and some very tedious and annoying sections (EG fighting waves and waves of mutants that seem to be almost completely immune to shotgun shells to the face.)

Even level design was improved manifolds from 2033 which helped us in pushing stealth to whole new limits. This game had one of the best endings I have ever seen. Never knew something so little can become such a huge deal.

There were also lot of boobies and there were a few Monster Boss fight which gave me insane adrenaline rush.

The only bad thing I would say is : optimization. Even after being such an old title I saw performance drops sometimes, Game crashes 3 times and getting stuck between impossible spaces and glitching through surfaces.

THIS GAME IS EASILY RECOMMENDED - 9.5/10. Buy it even at full price or get it for dirt cheap price in metro safa bundle.

I love the gunplay these Metro games have, all weapons feel fantastic. There is weight to the combat, it feels amazing to shoot people and monsters. Decent story. I had fun even on my 2nd playthrough for the 100%.

The game is kind of realistic, except for those armored blokes who can take like 5 headshots and 1-2 grenades under their feet and still survive. I fucking hate these in all shooters. If it is some kind of monster or some unknown creature being that resilient, ok you can justify that, but a regular ass human eating 5 headshots, multiple grenades, there is no armor that can withstand that, not even 1 headshot, let alone 5. And the grenade? Yeah no, especially not in this setting... it boils my blood every time devs do this.

The other thing I don't really like is the stealth, it is great that there is the option to do it but imho it doesn't work (at least for me). I have yet to play a game with decent stealth, not even in games dedicated to it. The AI have a weird hivemind, they don't see you at point blank ranges at times, other times they wallhack you across the map.",1666176123,1666177061,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are awesome and sounds are great (if you don't mind that some sounds are Half Life).
This games' story is so great its hard to find other games have their story this interesting, versatile and where you can immerse too. This game doesn't have such a side to it as a problem, just features in my opinion, but to be honest getting the good ending took me a while.

This game makes you think outside of your preferences, also in some ways shows the sad (and maybe cruel) reality of humanity.

I encountered only 2 bugs, and they did not anyhow eat out the motivation and excitement of playing this game, usually imo finding bugs even rarely in games can make the game seem bad, but in this one it didn't happen at all.

Personally for me the game offered a good story with the gameplay being forgiving and punishing at the same time. Depending upon the difficulty you chose to play, you'll be treated that way. The story telling was good and you can feel the connection from the prequel into this one very well. 
Although most of the stuff seems fine still idk why the game runs terrible in spite having overkill specs even for the recommended settings and it being a redux some of the textures just don't feel right. But if you tweak a little bit here and there you might get a decent experience.

It was not easy and I had to use a controller and sit away from my pc to shield my eyes from the monsters that jump out at the character. I made it past the scariest point but I still couldn't look at the monsters. But then something happened. At some point in the game the player character meets an extremely hideous child mutant. The last surviving member of a race called Dark Ones  after they were blown up by missiles by the player character in the previous game. What follows is a journey of redemption and forgiveness as the player character bonds with the young mutant as they team up to fend off the dangers of this world in order to reach a common goal. Themes of motherhood and loss are all over the place. Themes of tolerance and acceptance. By the end of the game I was no longer sitting away from my monitor, repulsed by the hideous appearance of the young mutant and bug-like monsters. So powerful is the story of this game.

Some weird hitboxes here and there, transparent stairs, bulletproof curtains, you know, the usual.
But still... AWESOME game.
I tend to take that stuff seriously and judge harshly for them, but here I just couldn't help myself but laugh it off.
Those flaws pale in comparison to the track record of this series (metro 2033 shares the vast majority of the good points)

The world feels so alive, with the setting respected and maintained expertly in all visual and gameplay aspects.
The direction you look matters, NPCs will react to you naturally, and their dialog hits that exact line of relevance to you as a player and believability.
No two gun shops have the same dialog, everyone has their style and circumstances.
Immersion is not something you have to worry about here, at all.
Ranger mode is incredibly interesting to struggle in, ammo management is a must, and hitting heads and timing shots are essential to survive, let alone having spare ammo at the end.
Stealth is simple but sharp, one mistake can quickly turn a flawless run around into a disaster.

One small problem I had with the first game (metro 2033) is the chain of companions you go through.
While making a semblance of sense in the story, felt really contrived and called upon all the luck in the knows universe.
This game sets you off alone, relying on the personal connections built in the first game, I LOVED that change, and it makes perfect sense in the story too.

The writing is incredible and holds up a solid image, unafraid to reach into the important questions, the questions this game is all about.

Your choices MATTER.
Your actions MATTER.
Even the ones not presented neatly with a 'good' and 'bad' option.


What makes you human?
Why is your life worth more than the people at the end of your muzzle?

I remember when I played this game, I didn't liked it as much as Metro 2033, and now I know why. The previous game had more of a mystery, had a lot more horror elements with a bit of action involved. This game is more action oriented, which for some this might be good, but for others like me I preferred the spooky atmosphere that the previous game had, the fear of the unknown if you will. 

Another issue I have with this game is that the story is fine, but it's not written as well as the first one. There are a lot more scripted events than in the previous games.

With that in mind, this is by no means a bad game. It still offers a good experience, maybe not as much as Metro 2033 but still good enough.

Pros:
+ The environment is still spot on
+ Most of the action scenes are fun, stealth mechanics have been improved a bit
+ The game is by few hours longer than the previous game
+ More weapons
+ More customization 
+ Music is good
+ The expanded lore is a definitive plus to the game


Cons:
- Some of the action parts near the end of the game feel forced
- The story is a bit weaker than the previous game
- Levels aren't as memorable as previous game
- Bad ending is shit, like really shit. You need a guide to get the good ending. While Metro 2033 also had a bad ending, it was more fitting than this one.

The stealth has improved a bit, the environment design has a bit more life to it, and it occasionally leans more into the underlying horror vibe the Metro book goes hard into. If you didn't like the first game this one probably won't sell you on it, but it’s another 10 or so hours of that delicious Metro atmosphere that hooked me in 2033. I should also say that in my most recent playthrough I found a pretty unacceptable bug that knocks down my recommendation to ""get it on sale"". It's not gamebreaking, thank god, but still immersion breaking.

Anyway, the story this time around is that word of the existence of the secret military bunker Artyom and the gang found at the end of the last game has gotten around the metro. Two major factions have eyes on the prize, the Nazis, who are facists and the Reds who are, you guessed it, capitalists, and they’re all willing to spill blood over it. Meanwhile, Artyom has discovered that there’s one Dark One remaining after he drone strike’d them all to death at the end of the last game and that finding him might be his one chance for redemption. 

So the plot involving the human factions is much more involved this time around, which I’m a fan of. Mostly. On the one hand, such a tight density of good and terrible Russian accents means that a Metro-wide conflict basically is inevitable, and the absence of something overarching in 2033 was a bit glaring. Yes, the Reds and Nazis were at each other’s throats, trying to find which characters were voiced Steve Blum pretending to be Russian and purging them for the sake of racial purity, but that was background stuff. Here it fleshes out the contrast between the elements of the Metro, against the Dark One’s plans and the various encroaching mutants on and under the surface, the background supernatural elements. Each faction has its own agenda. It also means that the explosive final confrontation is actually earnt, than a complete tonal lurch in a game that’s mostly stealth - the go-to for bad stealth games when they can’t think of a more climactic ending (looking at you, Dishonored 2)

But there is a problem in that… Well, you need exposition about the villain’s plans in a plot like this but the Metro games are committed to not leaving Artyom’s perspective. Fair enough, but this means that he’s captured by the Reds and the Reich something like 4 separate times over the entire game, for no other reason than so he can watch an important conversation between various political figures behind the cover of the vent he’s crawling through. It kind of screws with the game’s pacing, especially in the first half. To me, these games are at their best keeping a healthy rotation of all facets of the setting - the fact that you can overhear a logical discussion on communism (just kidding, there are none) and then walk for five minutes and be mauled to death by giant spiders is what makes it interesting.

Last Light is still mostly picaresque, though, just down from 80% to 70%. The majority of the story is what happens on the way to the next plot cutscene. And I tell a lie, in addition to exposition, one of those imprisonments also results in you meeting Pavel, a recurring Red foot soldier about to be executed alongside you. He demonstrates the franchise’s knack for creating fleshed out characters in the tiny spans of time you accompany most of them. Yes, they’ve all got that dour vibe of someone trapped in a giant cramped concrete tomb, but each meets it with different attitudes - resolve, humour, fear, cynicism, violence - and more often than not the banter between them is heartwarming in spite of the circumstances.

The segments where you’re alone in survival horror mode are pretty great as well. Those giant spiders are what I meant when I mentioned how Last Light leans more into the horror angle - their design is pretty ingenious. First off, they’re giant spiders - unnerving screeches and scuttling sounds are pH neutral when they’re around. But also, their exoskeletons are communistproof, so you have to shine your torch on them to burn it away and flip them belly-up for a few shots. Sounds simple enough, but a), there’s usually more than one, so you have to occasionally switch between them to stop one from noshsing on your leg while giving his mate skin cancer, and b), they run away as you shine a light on them, which means that the most effective strategy is to fucking look away, LET them scuttle up towards you in the darkness of your peripheral vision and only THEN turn your light on them. And Marx and Engles help you if you’re too late on the draw. As a recovering arachnophobe, I can confirm it’s great. 

On the whole, the monster design is pretty creative; it reminds me pleasantly of Resident Evil 4. Although the game isn’t amazing at directing you around on your way to them, particularly on the surface. The skyboxes have more colour and life and scale to them, which is nice, but trying to spot a series of brown wooden poles with washed-out red flags on them amidst the brownish-green reeds of a swamp?
 
And it’s weird because the design of stealth rooms in the Metro have improved quite a bit. The floodlights that seared yo’ subterranean corneas out till you couldn’t keep track of enemies are gone, so they’re easier to keep track of, there’s more of them to bob and weave through so doing so is more satisfying. Their helmet lamps double as vision cones, there’s a delay between getting spotted and the alarm being raised and you can naturally exit a firefight situation by hiding behind cover, though guards won’t forget you exist.

In a word, I’d describe it as “competent” but there are a few issues. For one, the game is pretty stingy with autosaves, which can send you back pretty far. There’s occasionally their habit of just having very clear and unengaging paths of darkness to crouch through that don’t need any knockouts or distractions to get through. This isn’t universal, and there’s plenty of meaty challenges getting to safes with resources and their keys in more exposed areas. Timing your waltz into a fully lit area for when no one is looking, for example. For this reason I’d suggest upping the difficulty so that it’s actually necessary. There’s also very few unique mechanics to get through the environment, nothing like Dishonored’s powers or Thief’s selection of arrows. You occasionally need to shoot out lights and raise a guard’s awareness level to get through more safely, but it doesn’t happen nearly often enough to be a core mechanic. 

And, unfortunately, the stealth is where we find that bug. About halfway through my most recent playthrough, the knockout/stab takedowns stopped working. No prompts, no reaction to spamming E or V.  And with scarce ammo the karma moral choice system that means you can’t initiate combat, quite a few rooms ended in trial-and-error dashes to the nearest loading screen. Again, not gamebreaking, but pretty damn unacceptable for a game that rides on immersion.

I'm playing on Hardcore. The stealth is an infuriating slog, and checkpoints too far apart. When you hit a stealth-focused area of the game, expect to spend several hours trying to get through scenes that should only last minutes.

There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to when the enemy will notice you. Sometimes you can snipe an enemy with a silenced weapon like the Tihar and no one will notice. Other times, you'll snipe the same enemy in the same spot with the same weapon and someone around a corner in a different room will ""see"" it, or everyone in the level will hear it, blowing your stealth for the rest of the level. Sometimes enemies won't see you while looking directly at you from 5 feet away; other times, they'll notice you so easily that you'd think you were wearing a neon sign.

In a well-designed stealth game, you should be able to make educated guesses about what you can get away with, e.g. when you can kill an enemy without being noticed. In Last Light: Redux, you can only get through most stealth sections with exhausting trial-and-error to determine what you can do that will or will not be noticed.

I'm currently stuck on a game-breaking bug in the ""Contagion"" level. There's a particular checkpoint where, when you first reach it, you're hidden in a crawlspace under the floor; the enemies are not aware of you and you can try stealthing around as normal. However, if you ever reload the checkpoint, the enemies are on maximum alert. If you take so much as a single step forward, every enemy in a 30 foot radius will snap to attention and start talking about the noise you're making. If you step out from under the floor, in the [i]only[/i] path you can take, they'll immediately spot you. The only ""solution"" I've found is to replay the level from the beginning (which could mean wasting anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on how seriously you try to stealth), but if you fail and have to reload the checkpoint, the bug comes back.

I don't recall having these issues when I played the original version of the game, though admittedly it's been quite a while. Certainly don't expect any support from Deep Silver, as they only support a game for a few months after release and then stop caring altogether.",1663655918,1663656937,False,34,10,0.608259499073028564,0,True,False,False

The story is good but it has a sudden end and feels very rushed. The gunplay is good but the stealth mechanics are buggy and badly developed. The atmosphere is fantastic. My biggest issue with this game is that it's a buggy mess(I encountered a bug with every boss so I had to restart and do every boss twice), it feels rushed in many parts, and it starts to fall off near to the end.

Seriously, wtf was that ending?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While this game is a huge improvement to the original Metro 2033, it has some terrible fun-ruining bugs and issues I encountered. The game gives you a shit ton of ammo though, so at least you can't soft lock in this game due to that.

The gameplay is a huge improvement, with a larger variety of guns and attachments! I also like that they made a stealth system that, y'know, actually fucking works. The gunplay works the same as Metro 2033 but it does feel more fluid and fit for action sequences. Enemies can now have armour on them making them harder to kill, although on normal difficulty you can take a shit ton of shots before dying, but that's better for the average player I feel like. If you died in one shot regardless, players would just be funnelled into a stealth run. Gunplay isn't particularly the best and with the addition of armoured enemies, it feels like this game heavily favours stealth than run-and-gunning.

Stealth is where this game falls flat. The stealth system works but it works with very specific rules. Step out of darkness for a second? Oops, all enemies in the room are alerted! Move one step(not an exaggeration) while not crouched? Oops, all enemies in the room are now alerted! Use a gun with a silencer? Oops, all enemies in the room are alerted! The last one is probably the most damning. Silencers DO NOT work. Even when shooting an enemy that was far away from their allies, enemies would go on alert. This happens with all specific stealth ""rules"" this game has. To top it all off, when an enemy sees you, you have 1 exact second to react, but I expect the reality is enemies because alerted instantly if you kill the spotter before they yell out. To top off the topping off, enemies also seem to instantly see you from anywhere when on alert and that's just too crazy. Silencers not working? Taking a single step forwards and enemies suddenly shooting at you through a wall? No, those are nothing. Enemies that just instantly lock on you even when you're hidden way across the entirety of the room is just blasphemy. It also seems like moving between individual areas of a level doesn't clear alert status, as I had moved into another area and enemies immediately started shooting at me. Frustrating, to say the least.

My major problem with this is that going from stealth to sudden action just sucks. If you're trying to stealth, and you know you're doing things right, you don't want to suddenly have the game tear that atmosphere away from you. This game is MUCH more fun than Metro 2033 in stealth and it feels a lot better to stealth in this game, but it's not fun when visible flaws in the game make it harder than it should be.

I think some of my issues with the stealth system is due to the fact that this game has quite a few bugs. Most of them are minor annoyances but some of them are just awful. I had a checkpoint save occur at the exact moment someone happened to go on alert, and this caused all enemies to go on alert and charge to my location upon loading that checkpoint. Not only that, but I had to keep on loading(for obvious reasons) and this caused the game to bug out and crash, although thankfully save corruption seems to be rare. Crashing does seem to be a common issue however. 

The checkpoint system is pretty bad but mostly because in certain areas, a single room can have several checkpoint triggers. This can lead to the stealth issue I mentioned above. The checkpoints are also just few and far between sometimes.

The music is pretty good and the overall atmosphere is much better than Metro 2033. There's much more colour in Last Light, and 2033 was just so bleak and gray without purpose.

I got this game on sale(for really cheap, the number I see at the time of writing is $5.49), so I don't see why I shouldn't finish this game for such a great price and it's a fun game to play. I just had to write my review on this after suffering some egregious issues with the gunplay and the stealth gameplay. Everything else is fine.

EDIT: Added in a paragraph about the checkpoints.

EDIT 2 : Upon further playing, I'm experiencing more and more issues. There's a bug with the swamp boss that is ""fixed"" by restarting the chapter, and this is more of an annoyance but assault rifles in this game quickly become useless, especially against mutants(although the game claims otherwise). The mutants are bullet sponges in this game, even on normal difficulty.

EDIT3 : And yet ANOTHER bug with the next boss, Big Momma, that causes you to fly all over the room after you kill it.",1656461519,1663285332,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The shooting is solid, headshots matter with all enemies and those knife kills.. oh god. Feels good to play especially since you feel like you are managing a tactical suit without absurd menus.

The Story:
I love the depressing/scary take on post apocalypse compared to the goofy antics of Fallout. There are funny moments but it doesn't feel out of place.

The Visuals:
A big revamp from the original 2033 which looked literally dry by comparison. If it isn't explicitly stated this is on a remake level of upgrade.

The Sound:
The guns sound good, the voice acting is on point, the music is perfectly somber and it helps set it's mood very well.


The Experience:
Both the 2033 Redux and the Last Light Redux seem to have been painted with the same brush. Much of what I like the first is done well on this one.

(((sometimes those scripted interaction make them stuck at one interaction which is bug or glitch))) , 
and this game has terrible save system, it doesnt have save feature but it has autosave. 

The problem with autosave in this game is it only happened at specific checkpoint, cutscene isnt included which is sucks, to get good ending, you need to do A LOT OF REQUIREMENT, not just by not killing certain enemies, even decision making on cutscene too like wtf lol, let players choose whatever they want, i knew this system also in metro 2033 but it is sucks, metro exodus also has this, you cant kill certain enemies to get good ending, come on, hope they changed this, because it is so much bullshit",1613877722,1662789189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u]What I liked about the game[/u]
[list] 

[*]	Like the last game, I really enjoyed exploring the metro tunnels and the derelict buildings of Moscow. The levels in Last Light are well designed and also have a lot of detail. There are more secrets and explorable areas compared to 2033. I also really enjoyed exploring the populated stations like, Venice and the Theater.  

[*]	Likable characters like Pavel, Khan, and the dark one. 

[*]	Last Light has some awesome new weapons like the Preved and the RPK. The weapons look and sound fantastic. The weapons also have a good kick to them.   

[*]	The story is top-notch. The game had a lot of memorable moments, especially the ending. 

[*]	The game also has some bonus missions which you can complete at anytime. In the bonus missions you get play as different characters, like Pavel, Anna and Khan.  

[*]	The game still has those cool mechanics, like being able to burn cobwebs with a lighter, having to use a gasmask on the surface, and having to recharge your flashlight or pneumatic weapon. 

[*]	I really enjoyed Metro’s atmosphere, it is quite a dark and gritty game. I like it when you encounter anomalies and apparitions throughout the levels. 

[*]	I like that you can collect pieces of Artyon’s journal. The Journal tells you what artyon is thinking and gives you a bit more information on the story.

[*]	The game offers a good challenge. Sometimes the game puts you in a situation that might seem unfair, for example Red Square, but it is satisfying being able to complete a level without getting caught or dying.   

[*]	The game has some new enemies and boss fights.  

[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u] 

[*]	I hate the ladders in this game, because sometimes you are unable to climb them or you start climbing them dead slow. 

[*]	It would have been nice to know where I was on the Karma meter when playing the game.  

[*]	Some of the levels I felt were a bit short. 

[*]	It’s a shame you can’t use junk or an item to distract an enemy, but this was something they added in Metro Exodus. 

[*]	I did encounter some bugs and glitches throughout the game.  

[*]	The soundtrack wasn’t as good as the first game. They reused a few of the tracks from 2033. 
[/list]
[u]Conclusion[/u] 

A very good sequel to 2033. Like the first game it took me a while to get into, because I wanted to play the game right and playing the game on Spartan mode just felt wrong. You get to explore more of the metro and the ruins of Moscow. The game has a lot of memorable moments like[spoiler] riding the railcar and the massive shootout at the end[/spoiler]. The game does put in some unfair situations which may seem impossible, but the game is very rewarding when you do it right. If you enjoy post-apocalypse games , then I highly recommend the game.

(Minor spoilers may follow). Compared to the original Metro 2033, I actually preferred this game, as I found the story to be much better than the original game. As a Spartan, Artyom is tasked with eliminating the sole survivor of his missile strike on the Dark Ones, a cute little mutant who can read minds and has some neat abilities. Of course, nothing is as simple as it seems, and before long Artyom finds himself at the center of a bio-terrorist attack in the metro and a conspiracy to seize control of the Moscow underground. At the center of it all lies the most annoying and stupidly smug character, Pavel, ever to exist in either the Metro or Stalker franchises. Being forced to deal with this guy throughout the game did not win any brownie points from me, but the gameplay did. As before in Metro 2033, stealth or guns blazing is an option, and both are completely achievable, allowing the player to pick their preferred style of play/ A few new weapons made an appearance in Last Light like a semi-automatic pistol, bolt-action rifle and anti-material rifle, but frankly I found myself preferring to stick with tried and trusted weapons of 2033. Furthermore, the Redux version introduced some curious variants of existing weapons, such as the shotgun I have thus dubbed the ""Quadruplet"" (A Duplet with four barrels, making it the most powerful shotgun in the game). Now, fighting humans aside, Last Light presents its fair share (sadly) of mutant combat, and the new enemies (the shrimp) left me wishing I had stayed back underground. In summary, if you liked Metro 2033 you will like Last Light- more of the same gameplay, with arguably a better story. Overall Score: 9.2/10",1662319646,1662319646,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After the download to my PC which took at least 20mins I decided to play this game 1st,
Wow what a game and it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire game which took me just about 30hrs to complete.
If your into heavy FPS action which requires quick thinking,fast actions and a mixture of stealth then you may really be interested in playing this awsome game.
The graphics are spectacular considering that its aging rapidly and the game presents many many jump scares during the actual gameplay which will keep you on your toes,
To me I feel as if the game pushes the limit a bit too much with overkill as far as some missions go to the point you will be saying when is too much enough already as there are a few cases in the game when it seems as if it will never end as your battling either human foes or creature foes and it does become a bit overkill at times.
You will get stuck in a few missions and will need to check the WIKI page or Google for info on how to get onwards to the next chapter or mission but as with most great games there isnt much hand holding and if you cant figure something out theres always info online to help you out of a jam.
If your looking for a great story these Metro games are pretty awsome and im about to install Metro 2033 which is the 1st game in the series so I can be caught up with story and then I will play Exodus last.
Last Light offers players alot of gaming after the main story is completed and the replay value of the story is pretty high as are the extra chapters players can play after the main story is completed which makes this an even more epic game.

A few reasons as to why: this game felt smoother and it overall aged better in my experience. I found it to be less tedious at times, I also experience more heart racing events. The creepiness got turned up a notch and genuinly had me shivering from time to time. 

A critique point: I feel like I have to mention is that i honestly didnt really understand what i was doing and why. But for someone who doesn't need an incredibly well written story, this game should be a blast!

It features shooting, exploration, and scavenging, but ultimately it is a linear story where you are introduced to a terrifying yet mysterious post-apocalyptic Moscow, filled with mutants and monsters, but also enigmatic beings like anomalies or ""the shadows"". Also, it has a great variety of difficulty settings, so you can suit the game to you preferred way of enjoying shooters, be it sneaky survivor or Rambo, which is great in my opinion.

Metro is one of the few ""campaign only"" games that I've replayed about 2-3 times each already (both 2033 and Last Light).

It is on the same engine, so much of the guns and hud/menus look the same as well. It doesn't do much new besides continue the story, which is the main reason to play this one in my opinion. 

There are a few standout moments like this part where you're driving a railcar through the tunnels and can get out to explore side areas if you choose. I feel like there are more moments in this game where you're fully alone and that's where Metro shines in my opinion, so generally I think I enjoyed this one more than 2033 but they are VERY similar games so in the future I'm sure trying to remember which was which will be hard. 

It's more Metro, and if you like 2033 you'll enjoy this one too. I will say going for the good ending kinda sucks though, there's a morality system and if you do bad things like kill surrendering people or don't help certain people with side quests, you'll be perceived as a bad person and get the bad ending.

I can't take the gas mask off because i die. 
I can't work out where to go because:
1) I can't see clearly through the gas mask
2) there's no map that i can see
3) it's just damn unclear where i'm supposed to go

It's a bit frustrating tbh that there's so much unskippable cutscenes and yet when you actually need some help you've got none whatsoever. Just some hint. Something. But I used up about 5 gas mask canisters running around looking for where i'm supposed to go. 

Naturally when i die i've got to fight all the enemies again. 

If i rage quit the game i've got to wait for over a minute for the German games manufacturer to stop advertising how awesome it is to me. 

German computer games suck. I recognise a lot of these problems with Crysis too.

Just to add to this, it's a really painful game, the game is sluggish, not lag, but it's slow to respond and everything feels heavyweight like the aim, the firing, actions take a long time to perform. It's 60fps. But it's like by the time you fire the enemy has moved, and ofc because you've missed you run out of ammo. There are many situations where running out of ammo is just game over. And what can you actually do? It'll just respawn you in the same place with little ammo. 

It's a bit hard to know what to do now, because i can't see how i can continue playing, and it's not obvious if it's possible to get more ammo. 

Also some things in the game seem broken. For example i was in a mine car, and i got stuck in it and couldn't get out of it. It wouldn't let me. Also on the mine car level, the mine car got jammed in reverse and went down the track but the mine car was physically still where i parked it. Even though the 3d visuals had moved, the physics had not. Another weird thing on the minecar level was that i found myself climbing up nothing. There was literally nothing there but it was behaving as a ladder and i could climb above the level for some inexplicable reason. 

That was a pretty buggy level lol.

The graphics were upgraded, that's for sure, characters look more realistic and overaly better, considering it's game from 2014. Same goes for monsters and Little Dark One - I'm especially happy about the last one, he looks incredibly good. But still there was a problem with physics, and some of the characters broke their neck by trying to look at Artyom. Hilarious, not gonna lie, but I'd rather not see something like that. 

Story is amazing. I really enjoyed it and had so much fun. There are parts where it slows down, letting the player just wander on the surface, and the areas, where you're fighting for you life, cursing out lack of ammo and filters. Not gonna lie, at some point the game got really hard, had to pay attention to my surroundings, enemies, ammo, adn to be sure to be undercovered. This was some great challange I was hoping for! Not waves of enemies that are flooding you, but rather good amount to make you think before you act. Plus the main story is really long, comparing to 2033, which is great.
Going back to story - the characters also make it amazing. We have Pavel, a fucking communist with cute smile - this sums him up. He's incredibly well written, I had love-hate relationship with him the whole time I was playing Last Light. Dude is so smart, yet trusts so blindly the Red Line, never questioning their motives. Probably one of the best characters in whole Metro games - you can't say he's good, or he's bad, he balances between those two, making him an absolutely interesting character, that you just can't forget about. Anna was a surprise to me - I played Exodus first, so I remember her as sweet and caring, here keeping her distance, which I didn't expect. But I did like her a lot! ""Krolik"" caught me off my guard. I sure did blush at this one, haha! Another big plus is DLC missions, that gave us insight of not main characters, like Khan, which I liked, since he's one of my favs, and there was little known about him in game. Also got a chance to see Ulman again! Which I'm super happy about. And, of course, our Little Dark One - I can't say too much, but everybody, you are going to absolutely love this child. How I wish we saw more of him there.

Combat hadn't changed too much, but the main difference is that it's less junky. Also the waves of enemies you were drowning in, which I mentioned before, has been reduced to amount enough to make you think before acting. This is way better, than it was in 2033, since I actually have time to reload my weapons and don't have 5 wachmen on me. HUD is still sometimes not showing up, which is a pain in the ass while doing stealth, but it happened only twice to me. Still very little places, where we can buy filters, but they're more common in metro now, so it's not as painful, as it was in 2033.

Moral Point. The most annoying thing in the whole game - you can NEVER get the good ending the first try, it's just impossible. They're so randomly given, some I got I didn't even find in the guide I was following. Or given by listening to the conversation that brings nothing into your game and is just annoying, since sometimes you're put in danger because of that. Some I had to miss on, because I would surely get spotted. Or looking for beggars to give them the bullet. Some of them are so well hidden it took me a while to get to them. 

DLC - are okay. I have three favs there. I liked the one with Librarians the most, even if it gave me heart-attack a few times. Gave a great insight of what Rangers' job looks like. And, obviously, I enjoyed Khan's DLC, tho lack of bullets pissed me off. Pasha's DLC was hard since we lack weapons at the beginning, so again, lots of thinking about your next move. The rest of DLC was nothing I was crazy about. The Sniper Team has a bug, where I can't shoot on my left. Which is annoying. 

Bugs I've encountered: HUD not showing up, Librarians attacking when I was staring at them, disappearing Notes and boxes, Sniper Team DLC. 

I absolutely recommend this game. It's well made considering how long ago it was created, great story and characters, good DLCs missions. It's my second fav, next to Exodus. I'm replaying it for third time now, so guys, it's hella good, I rarely do that, haha!

TL:DR
Buy this game if you like/love
-FPS with other elements.
-A mainly good story line that carries from the 1st part.
-shooting enemies in the head.

Don't buy this game if you dislike/hate
-FPS with mixed game elements (stealth, horror etc)
-linear gameplay structure.
-lack of replay value.



[b] Story Summery [/b]

Set 1 year after the events of Metro 2033, Last light continues Artyom's story and what his feeling after the events of the first game, among his own struggles he has to face enemies such as the Neo-Nazis and Neo-Communists. Last light takes Artyom's journey to previously met locations as long with new ones.

[b] Gameplay Overview [/b]

Like metro 2033, Last Light is an FPS game set in Post-apocalyptic Russia, with stealth and survival elements.

Players have a vast array of weapons to choose from, shotguns, assault rifles, and a few others, Players can also approach levels either by stealth or guns blazing.

Last light also carries over the linear level driven gameplay along with mild exploration that can reward players with equipment or ammo.

Like Metro 2033 the moral point system returns and functions the same way (good deeds = good points, bad deeds = bad points)

[b] DLC overview [/b]

With the Redux remaster all DLC are included upon purchase 

[b] Faction Pack [/b]

This DLC adds 3 new and original single-player missions, the missions and gameplay are focused around game features, such as shooting, stealth, sniping, and stalking.

[b] Tower Pack [/b] 

The dreaded Tower pack adds a single long and probably the hardest level in the game,

Mainly a wave based mode/level players take on different waves of enemies or mutants while surviving the onslaught.

[b] Developer Pack [/b]

Developer pack mainly adds missons that let you mess around with the game's AI such as battling mutants against each other, or by going to the Shooting range for some gun fun.

Also included is a museum level that showcases stuff you encounter in the game as statues, also part of this pack is 1 new single player level that has a heavy focus on 1 type of enemy.

[b] Chronicles Pack [/b] 

And lastly but not least my personal all time favourite the Chronicles Pack.

This pack includes 3 new levels that are each focused to characters encountered in the main story, it also expands on the lore and universe that tie in to the main game.

[b] Abzats and RPG machien gun [/b]

Nothing much to add here this 2 DLC are just 2 weapons added to the story.


[b] My personal experience [/b]

The story picks off almost immediately after the first game as I re-played this after completing the first its a nice way to jump right in. I've enjoyed the story as much as I did the first, but somethings that I notice is the horror element is slightly lacking compared to 2033 in 2033 there are maybe 1 or 2 areas that can make you jump, in last light I barely encountered any scenario that made me jump, there were some surprises like enemies attacking around the corner but that's nothing compared to what you'll encounter in 2033.

As for the gameplay because both Last light and 2033 are redux the gameplay is the same with the FPS and stealth nothing really worth pointing out if you played 2033 redux you won't feel any different here.

DLC wise I've really enjoyed Chronicles Pack each level is unique and tells a different point of view, as for the other packs and DLCS the other one I enjoyed was the Factions pack, the developer pack didn't add much and I got board of it quickly as it doesn't have a story at all. 

As for the Tower pack its probably my most dreaded DLC in any game for a while.. even playing on the easiest mode its just utter chaos, it feels unbalanced and slightly unpolished from the amount of damage you can receive, the AI seems to be on steroids also attacking more aggressively then their campaign counterparts.

I had to use well known glitch just to skip the tower level for the achievement.

as for replaying since its a linear game once you complete the story and get all the collectables there's not much replay value.

Thus my rating for last light will be the same as it was for Metro 2033, mainly because it doesn't offer much in terms of story.

Sure, there were some genuinely fun parts with solid action, atmospheric exploration, and horror.

This game came out almost 10 years ago but my PC (with RTX 2060 super) kept crashing every now and then, especially when loading the next map. Some of the missions are frustrating and the resources are so scarce that it forces you to go back and re-progress the previous chapter to get more ammo & air prepared for the part where you were stuck. It's impossible what you are going to encounter in the next part. For example I was in the middle of being a stealthy guy chasing down Pavel with a pistol and a shotgun but I didn't expect the chapter right after this one was to go through tens of monsters as swiftly as possible. I didn't have enough air and the only firearm I found in the wasteland was a sniper with <10 ammos. Maybe I'm a shitty console player but I failed the mission too many times.

I love the play style and aesthetics and would continue to play but my patience is slowly getting thinner with these glitches and replaying for preparedness...",1657149816,1657149816,False,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

- Mutant fights are few and mutants themselves are not spammed in overwhelming numbers, just 2-3 at a time at most.
- The ""tour guide"" missions a'la CoD are few and far between.
- The stealth missions are vastly improved and some even allow full ghosting (i.e. sneaking by without killing/knocking out anyone).
- The railway levels actually allow you to stop at any time and explore the side rooms and hallways.
- The creepiness is still there, and a great Dead City level with some brilliant horror atmosphere.
Compared to LL, the original Metro seems more like an introduction to the setting, while LL is the first proper game.

However, some problems still persist:
- No manual saves. This was an issue in 2033, but more so in LL. With proper stealth missions, having to restart an entire section because of a single mistake, is a complete chore. This concerns all stealth games with checkpoints by the way.
- Still no FoV slider.
- It crashed on me a few times.
- The endings being based on moral points again, which are often so dumb and arbitrary, that there is no way you're gonna get the good ending on your first playthrough.

Storywise I have to go on a bit of a tangent. The story is above average, but still not good enough to focus on it so much. 2033 and Last Light are pushing their plots really hard onto the player, which would be fine, if they were good and/or interesting. For me, they were not, and the ample cutscenes, dialogues, scripted events, all take the attention away from the world itself, which is fascinating.

I played 2033 Redux and LL Redux only on Survival Normal, but out of curiosity I read on other difficulties. The lack of decent information on those is surprising. In-game you only receive very short summaries as to what they do. The official wiki has details regarding the non-Redux versions. It took me an hour to find proper info, more or less.
Anyway, Ranger mode uses one of the worst methods of increasing difficulty: depraving the player of basic information. On Ranger Hardcore you literally have no HUD or prompts. To select a throwable you have to recall the HUD positions from memory or rely on sound cues the items make when selected, since the weapon wheel is invisible. It’s absurd.

In 2033 it wasn't as impactful but here it really makes a difference and rewards you for your decisions. Gameplay wasn't altered much, if at all but some weapons got added which spices up the combat a little bit - the classics of course stay.

Story dives even deeper into the lore of the world and the difference between the guns actually feels like they can adapt to your playstyle.
Length of the game is around 1-2 hours longer than the first one, so it's definitely like ""a movie sequel"" to the first ""movie"" kind of pacing, but definitely worth playing the first one before playing this!

To keep it short: Compared to the first game, which I didn't really enjoy and which made me kinda rush to the credits, this one is so much different. Actually I planned to rush through this to finally being able to start Metro Exodus. But my plan went a different route.

The story kept me pretty much engaged from the very first chapter - okay let's say from the 2nd sequence, since the intro sequence felt as weird as the ending of the first game. But then, OMG, the game delivered what I call a JOY TO PLAY! It also has a plot twist which was pretty surprising. Absolutely great work!
This is achieved simply by the fact that Metro Last Light  pretty much excels at writing, world building, atmosphere, survival elements (gas mask, LIGHT, believe me, LIGHT will be your new best friend!) and stealth gameplay. Especially the survival elements felt almost NOT present in the first game. Here you pretty much feel them in almost every resp. level.
When it comes to stealth, I almost felt like Sam Fisher, stuck in Moscow - minus the high tech gadgets that kinda mark everything for you by using the Ubisoft forumala.

Anyway, the world is beleivablely pictured. The factions finally get the required screen time they deserve, but lacked in the first game, plus more. This is great to FINALLY show you, as the player why people fear specific factions. The first game pretty much lacked in this regard imo. Here they aren't empty jars anymore.
Also the people you meet in the tunnels and different hubs. It was so immersive and I did not want to miss any scripted sequence to listen to their talks and let me dive far more deeper into this world, while they shared their experience in this world!

But while talking about audio, resp. localization to be more precisely: The accents in this game are super annoying. And if I would rate this game,  I gave this title 8/10 points, just because of this flaw. The game makes the same mistake many other titles out there do as well:
YOU, a natively born RUSSIAN kid, never leaving the tunnels and area of MOSCOW, meaning, NEVER getting in touch with OTHER LANGUAGES, why do you have to have a Russian accent when playing the German OR English version? This ofc applies to the majority of the people in this game as well!
This makes the game feel so stupid in so many regards. I mean, I do not know any scientific result that proves our brains underly a respective accent when you're  talking with someone from another country. 
Game studios really need to stop this, when NOT implementing DIFFERENT spoken languages in a game!!! If there is only ONE language spoken, there is no need for accents  ladies and gents! 
This would only make sense if a slang supports the origin of a character, which Red Dead 2 pretty much excels at. But here? Maybe the Russian version achieves this by showing different accents of people. But the other languages simply cannot deliver the difference between Russian slang 1, 2 and 3. So please stop doing this and destroyingthe atmosphere. Hire some professional speakers instead!

Anyway, to sum this up: To me, this game just felt like a first person version of The Last of Us 2. I compare both, because I simply could not let the gamepad go when playing both games. Metro Last Light is terrifying, brutal, just written by grown people for grown people! Especially when considering some of the aspects of the game, this game deserves its PEGI 18 rating, it is absolutely not for the younger people out there below PEGI 16. Only the flaw with the voice acting kinda destroys a perfect rating for this masterpiece!",1657001771,1657002103,True,2,0,0.521484673023223877,0,True,False,False

[h2]Metro: Last Light Redux Review[/h2]

[b][h1]Gameplay[/h1][/b]
[i]First of all, the gameplay is the same as that of Metro 2033 Redux and the game can only be played from the viewpoint of the first person. In both games, except for the plot, there's no difference. Last Light continues the story of Metro 2033 where you have launched missiles against the dark ones (the bad ending). There are several new weapons in the game that are actually decent. You can customize your weapons at any weapon seller in the game (found at safe points). You can hold up to three guns at a time with other supplies. You can also select your approach to your enemies in the game, just like the previous game. And, of course, in the game, you will encounter numerous new creatures. The choices you make influence the ending of the game completely. Your watch shows whether or not you are exposed to your enemies. When you crawl up the surface, it is important to wear a gas mask due to radiation. Unless they see a dead body, using suppressed weapons to kill your enemies will not alarm other enemies. You also get other things like a journal, lighter, flashlight, universal charger which can be used to charge the flashlight. The game also uses ammo (military grade rounds) as a currency for buying weapons and other ammo during the game. [/i]

[b][h1]Modes in which the game can be played[/h1][/b]
[b]Survival:[/b] In this mode there are less supplies, lower reloading speed and enemies are hard to kill.

[b]Spartan: [/b]This mode is more action-oriented and gives you more resources.

[i]The modes are same as Metro 2033 Redux. [/i]

[b][h1]Graphics[/h1][/b]
[i]The graphics of the game are pretty good. The game can be easily played on a low rig. Playing on high settings is recommended, on low settings the game doesn't look that good. And do raise the brightness of the game a little bit to be able to see things, otherwise you will need to use your flashlight all the time. You will hardly find any difference in the graphics of Metro 2033 Redux and this game. [/i]

[b][h1]Pros And Cons[/h1][/b]
[b]Pros: [/b] [list]
[*]Decent Graphics.
[*]Optimized for low rigs.
[*]New weapons and creatures.
[*]Very good story.[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b] [list]
[*]No multiplayer / Local.
[*]AI needs improvement.[/list]

[b][h1]Extra Info[/h1][/b]
[i]If you want to get the good ending, help other people and avoid killing people who surrender. There are always ammo and filters hidden, carefully check your surroundings. Avoid killing creatures who are not facing you, so you can easily save some ammo. [/i]

[b][h1]Overall Rating[/h1][/b]
[i]Like Metro 2033 Redux, the game offers a lot of action and has a great story. Do not waste any time if you have played the previous part, just get it already. [/i]

You need a mouse fix to have proper raw input and aiming (it has split vertical + horizontal sensitivity that you CAN NOT change individually), certain boss encounters are also pretty rough and take the wind out of the experience + the Tank fight section at the end is very unintuitive.

One HUGE warning though: once you get to the Big Momma boss, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE SHOTGUN OR REVOLVER WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF AMMO to use on her. I spent close to 2 hours using hundreds of rounds of ammo from assault rifles and a sniper, and performed around 100 melee hits on various parts of the boss's body (head, neck, back, stomach, and face) and after trying this strategy (and dying dozens of times), I STILL COULDN'T TAKE THE BOSS OUT. I didn't have a revolver and had very few bullets in my shotgun (which is the boss's biggest weakness), so it offered little help in the battle. I ended up deciding to repeat a previous chapter and re-customize my weapon loadout before the boss fight, and made sure that I had a large amount of shotgun ammo, and ONLY THEN was I able to take out the Big Momma by only using a revolver. If you run out of ammo and the boss is still alive, just quit back to the main menu. There is zero reason to waste your time punching the boss and throwing equipment over and over again and hoping that she'll eventually die; I made this mistake and ended up wasting a bunch of time because of it.

As good as the game is, I have to warn you that it is pretty buggy from time to time, and these bugs can occasionally seriously mess up the gaming experience. These bugs range from falling under the map, me being taken into the wrong chapter multiple times over when I want to play a certain game chapter, getting stuck inside of a boss and dying because I can't turn or move while stuck in this situation, among other more minor bugs.

This is the second game in the series, and if you haven't played the first--""Metro 2033""--I highly recommend you start there.

So far I have already soaked in 200-300 hours across the whole series. The story telling, and game-play just compliment each other so well you can just get lost in playing for a few hours. Right now I'm replaying the whole series to achievement hunt which has proven more challenging than most other games I've completed, but in a good way.

I only have 2 issues with this game in the series:

1. The game drives my GPU crazy. I have a 3070ti, and yet this decade old game makes it heat up like a furnace, and the fans spike to 80%. Meanwhile I've run games like: Halo infinite, until dawn, and other more modern titles, and this doesn't happen. It's not a deal breaker, but I do find it odd.

2. The game occasionally crashes. This isn't atypical of older games, or games in general. Whats unique about these crashes are if you simply boot up the game, and continue where you left off the game will continue to crash. [b]Here is how I have found to fix the problem:[/b]

When you go to launch the game you will receive an error pop up asking to boot up in ""safe mode"", click NO, as all this will do is reset all your graphical preferences to the lowest possible setting. Once you get to the main menu go to CHAPTERS, and restart the chapter you were just playing. This will reset your save file, and purge anything that's been corrupted causing the crash. Any collectibles like Artyom's journals you've collected will be saved, but it wouldn't hurt to double check.

There were invisible walls all over the place and you couldn't get past them, the game basically forced you to travel in a pre-determined path. The collectables were rather easy to find. 

While the combat was somewhat flexible, it was very repetitive towards the end. Waves of mutants and other creatures/humans being hurled at you on several occasions, and you could see it happening even before it happened. The stealth aspect wasn't very good either. 

The story was much better than the first one, but it was all over the place. Voice acting was horrible for some characters and it completely killed the vibe in the end (dark one). Looking away from the person who is speaking would drastically lower the volume of the speech to an extent that you won't even make out if something is being said at all. 

The only thing I loved about this game was the atmosphere and the level of detail on the maps and surroundings. The sights were breathtaking and the whole set up was pretty great. The density of the establishments in the Metro were great to look at and explore.

Gameplaywise, it's more of the stealthy, Russian, post apocalyptic FPS goodness found in the first game.
Story is better with more compelling baddies.
A few more enemy types, and a couple boss battles thrown in.
Environments, character models and voice acting all quite good.
Frequent automatic save points.
It's 10 hours and that's exactly how long I wanted it.

The meh:
If you're looking for any serious gameplay advancements, you're not going to find any. There are one or two new guns and claymores. That's it.
It wears its influences (Stalker and Half Life) pretty brazenly.
It crashed 2-3 times. I think that's pretty acceptable.

The bad:
You do have different endings depending on...what? I still don't know if I got the good or bad one. Not a fan of games that make you look for online guides to help you get the best endings. But this is a minor quibble.
I really wished they'd clearly gone over the use of the compass (here and in the first game). I only realized it pointed toward my next objective because I read something online, about halfway through my game (yes, I'm an idiot).

Verdict:
If you don't like the creepy crawlies, stay away. For everyone else, it's a great on-rails adventure/shooter in a bleak but fascinating world of ghosts, mutants, Nazis and Communists. Can't wait to play Exodus.",1654863318,1654863412,True,1,0,0.512711822986602783,0,True,False,False

5. Bullet sponge Enemies

1. Lore for the trilogy, better than 2033

I've had it up to HERE with the bugs and crashes from this incompetent company. Yeah, the game got something going for it, a LOT actually, but this is starting to get old REAL QUICK thanks to:

- constant crashes in multiple sections of this VERY DRAGGED OUT, LONG GAME for what the game is trying to present
- very questionable checkpoint placements, hurts a lot on Survival Ranger Hardcore difficulty and just leaves a foul taste in your mouth (negligence, they did not care to playtest the checkpoints in this mode)
- corrupting of the save files for absolutely no reason in multiple sections, learning nothing from previous titles
- silly bugs throughout the entire playthrough like in a game from year 2000
- mouse sensitivity CANNOT be set to 1 pip (it will revert to only 0 or 2 upwards, wtf?)
- same horrible voice actor for 50 different characters in the 3rd (!) Metro game (Metro 2033, Metro 2033 Redux, Metro Last Light and now Metro Last Light Redux)... 

List goes on.

It has it's interesting moments, for example the little Dark One section, and some pretty good level design in many places. But overall, the story is just bland, uninspired and dry. Anna character was also probably just shamelessly plugged in at the end of the development of Last Light. Entire story feels half-a-you-know-what and recycled from the first game.

And finally - I STILL HAVE TO GO TO A CONFIG FILE TO CHANGE THE Field of View. After 3 previous games! Come on!

This has to be one of the worst game developers out there. I will punish myself and finish it for the achievements, but that's it.

Maybe I am too harsh, but I feel they deserve such review. Such potential, ruined by negligence and lack of attention. 8 years (!) after release, none of the above was fixed.

Astounding. Big dissapointment. Just know the little Dark One is what literally saved Last Light.

As I was expecting it takes the base that 2033 established and streamlines more of the clunkier aspects of the gameplay. There's a larger variety of weapons, stealth felt a tad easier and the level design feels much more open to multiple approaches. You can complete most of the enemy encounters without killing anyone, but there is still ample cover if things get too hot. The atmosphere is still amazing and I like the new checkpoints and towns visited in the story as it feels like getting a small look into how a society grows within the confines of the metro. The story itself was decent but takes a more black and white approach as compared to the greys that 2033 presented. Instead of finding the dark ones, you're trying to prevent a conflict between the main factions of the metro. More explosive sure, but not as nuanced as the first. In the end, I still enjoyed my time within both 2033 and Last Light, and I look forward to moving into Exodus.

Also, my game kept crashing on the last mission so I guess I didn't technically beat the game but I ain't gonna reinstall the game just to play 10 minutes of the game and get an achievement lol",1654131485,1654131485,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Combat has improved dramatically, now it feel way more satisfying to fight enemies and monsters. Graphics have (obviously) improved a lot as well, and the environments are gorgeous. The character models are now more unique and you don't feel like you've seen the same face a million times like in Metro 2033. You can now put attachments on weapons which is really nice. There is more enemy variety (for both humans and monsters) now. Even some smaller additions like pressing G to wipe the mud and blood off your gas mask is neat. I really like the music too, Especially the more gloomy and sad ones with the guitar. 

The story and characters (Especially Khan, Pavel and Artyom himself) are very well written as well, now I really want to read the Metro books. Those small scenes and dialogues between levels in safe areas are also nice.

Now for the little problems I had...

1. The stealth feels a lot easier and less fun than 2033, enemies are literally blind and silenced weapons make being undetected very easy to pull off.
2. The whole game itself is easier (or at least I felt that way), I would recommend playing on a harder difficulty than normal, because normal is actually EASY.
3. That ""romantic"" cutscene with [spoiler] Anna [/spoiler] was awkward.
4. Enemies are still kinda spongy like in 2033.
5. [spoiler] The good ending is easy to miss and I think most players got the bad one first time, the problem is that the game doesn't really make it obvious to the player that their choices are going to make a big difference. For example in BioShock, it was pretty obvious that harvesting or rescuing little sisters is a big deal and has an impact on the ending, but not here. [/spoiler]

I totally recommend Metro Last Light to people who like FPS, Survival and Post-Apocalyptic games.

Though they’re based off the popular post apocalyptic fiction book by Dmitri Glukhovsky, Metro Last Light does not follow the story line in the book, instead it is a direct sequel to Metro 2033 (the game and book). Last Light is a game I believe everyone should try. 

The attention to detail is phenomenal, every part of the Metro has been carefully engineered with precision to create the look of a worn and dying civilization. This attention to detail creates an immersive and atmospheric game.

The game's plot is excellent. The Metro is very atmospheric and immersive thanks to the excellent graphics, the slow paced solo guitar music and the excellent plot. I won't go into detail as I don't want to ruin the story for anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of experiencing the Metro games. Essentially you, Artyom, wipe out the Dark Ones with a plethora of nuclear bombs - or so you thought. Intense radiation plagues the streets, which has caused mutation in many species turning them violent, untamable and monstrous. On the way you meet people, discover the civilizations (Hanza, Reich, The Order) and have a great time. 

 The music and SFX are good but the voice acting feels lacking for some but most characters are excellently voice acted.

One of the throwable items is changed from a sticky grenade to a claymore. I was used to using the sticky grenade as it was easier to use when in a fight, but this didn't discourage me from playing the game. Another change was that there were more mutant varieties in the game, like the bosses Nosalis Rhino and Bear. Human enemies felt exactly the same. As for weapons, some were added. Aside from that, nothing else was added from a gameplay perspective.

Unlike the first game, this one had downloadable content. Nine new missions were added to this game. The missions ranged from short to long, and easy to difficult. I loved playing the Tower mission as it was a fun way to test the skills I've gained from playing first person shooter games.

Getting the good ending in this game isn't difficult, but a little troublesome. In order to get the majority of the positive moral points, you had to listen to long conversations between NPCs, which might be the reason why it took me longer to finish this game completely. A minimum of two playthroughs for the main campaign are needed to get all achievements. Like the first one, there are two modes and two endings.

The shooting mechanics, and stealth for this one is good. Though, enemies would sometimes not react in darkness even if you were standing in front of them.

As in the first part of Metro you slip into the role of Artyom. 
After a nuclear strike made the earth's surface more or less uninhabitable, he lives in the shafts and tunnels of the Moscow metro. Here the last survivors have found a refuge to survive more badly than right. 

However, they do not live alone here and there are enough enemies who attack and kill them again and again. Because anyone who dares to venture into the tunnels or well protected as Artjom to the surface needs nerves made of steel - there are all kinds of mutations that must have originated from worms or spiders and which have now assumed a monstrous appearance. But that's not all, because humanity, which has been decimated in this way, also fights among one another, as individual factions such as neo-fascists and neo-communists have now emerged. 
There are also banal bandits who want to rob you and your wards of your last shirt.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2807507075[/url]
[b]But that's not all[/b]. 
At the beginning of the game, you learn that a creature was discovered on the surface, although this species should actually no longer be alive. This is a form of life that could have emerged from surviving humans and that communicate using telepathy. This ability makes them so dangerous for the other survivors, as their spirit is often too weak to survive contact with these beings without harm.

[b]But your job is to investigate this sighting ... and then you'll be right in the middle of it.[/b]

[b]Because of the story alone, Metro Last Light Redux offers much more than just bashful shooting.[/b] You can decide whether you want to end the life of every opponent or maybe sneak past them. Because the decision not to kill a potential victim is remembered by the game and that in turn influences the later end of the game. Precisely this option of being able to leave out one or the other opponent also increases the replay value.

In addition, two game modes are also available with ""Survivor"" or ""Spartan"" - the first is something for tinkerers, the steps here must be planned because you will find less ammunition to reload here, among other things. And the second is a tough action spectacle.

A civil war is stirring that could wipe out the remaining humanity from the face of the Earth forever. 

You play as Artyom, burdened by guilt and driven by hope. A naive young boy who is not so young and not so naive anymore, after what happened a year before. You will have once again a lot of helpers, and sidekicks, that will help you, and you will help them along the way. You will have excellent missions and big problems to solve, levels are very good.

Then the infiltration map. So tight and forceful on progress that I just walk one wrong step and game over. Very annoying.

Second half drags on worse than the ""artsy"" finale of the first game, dredging through the consequences of Metro 2033's canonical bad ending, which is a bit annoying when you've gotten the good ending.

Speaking of endings, getting the good or bad one depends largely on gathering arbitrary secret points for interacting with the game world (even things like playing with instruments lying around). Basically, you can only get the good ending if you interact with almost everything in the game, no matter how tedious it may be to drink with npcs and get lap dances, or watch a horribly boring theatre show to the end (and act morally in the obvious situations).

So same gunplay, stealth, shopping, gasmask etc. So basically everything that I said about the 1st  game is the same on this one, which is a great thing. Again I'm not going to tell about the story you just have to experiance it yourself. LL ads couple more guns to the mix like automatic shotgun that looks like a AK, two different high caliber sniper rifles and semi-automatic/automatic pistol similar to Mauser from the WW1. LL was scary but not as scary as 2033. All though it had more jumpscares. I feel that LL has more replayability than 2033. All and all great sequel.

On my second playthrough I finished the game with stealth and as non-violently as possible (trying to kill just few human enemies) and it made me wanna rip my nutsack and burn it on pig fat *reference*. It's still loads of fun!

I bought the Metro Redux bundle.


Buy it now

Note/helpful tip if your fps is low: When a started the game it ran like turd in a blender, 25-45 fps. I didn't have the same problem with 2033 (2033 ran like 80-90+ fps on max). What helped me was that I lowered my SSAA settings to 2x instead of 4x and after that fps was same compared to 2033. And if your pc is not the most powerful then I advise you to lower that setting to 0.5x ( game won't look that great but it's 100% worth it and it will run well) 

Note#2: After completing the game in the main menu go to chapters and press Q to choose to play dlc missions. Yes dlc is included in the redux version of the game. And their fun.

[b] Soundtrack: [/b] 7/10
[b] Graphics: [/b] 7.5/10 
[b] Gameplay and Sound Design: [/b] 8/10, 8/10

[b] Plot and Dialogue: [/b]
The plot and dialogue of this game takes the essence of our last game and decides to take a twist on it by having it a story similar to that of Jesus Christ in the Bible. It certainly is an interesting take but it is well executed here and keeps the player emotionally invested through out. I feel the morality of our decisions is much more weighted here compared to Metro 2033. There are many intricacies and storylines present throughout this game that I would find it hard pressed to not relate to this game in some way, shape, or form.

[b] Setting and Art Design: [/b]
The setting and art design is extremely similar to Metro 2033 but there is a more varied environment that is used which is great to see. The metro still feels decrepit and like a hellscape. Great job on the developers part.

[b] Soundtrack: [/b]
Soundtrack has a minor step up compared to the previous game, with the music being somewhat more pervasive and able to help amplify the scenes we see and live through.

[b] Graphics: [/b]
Graphics are just as good as the previous entry, which are good but not great graphics.

[b] Gameplay: [/b]
The gameplay has the same core elements as the previous game, but the gameplay felt much more responsive and dynamic, giving you many more opportunities through the game to take a stealthy approach. There is more weapon variety so you can customize your loadout better.

New enemies are introduced and new mechanics are introduced with the Dark One, which makes things interesting and keeps the game feeling fresh, while still the similar feeling we expect from the franchise. 

You can pick which difficulty, one that emphasizes combat more, while the other emphasizes stealth and scavenging more. Both are good options to play the game. 

You can collect Artyom's journal entries throughout the game which provides a very interesting look into his mindset that you would not regularly find throughout the game. I enjoyed reading them and I highly recommend you do collect these. 

Sound design is good and works well for the game.

Pleased to have completed the second entry in the metro series, returning again you play as Artyom in the gritty horror filled metro tunnels beneath Moscow.

Sequel boasts improved graphics and story line which I can say was incredible, the new weapons and mutuants made this far more enjoyable then the first game, sound design definitely keeps you on edge the whole play through which will last around 10 hours if you take your time. I have to say again though.. some of the mutuants are bullet sponges... later on you will fight these creatures that crawl out of the water and you will.. without a doubt blow through all your ammo...

I wanted to save D6 (your allied bunker) so I tried my best to do a good guy play through.. somehow I still failed and had to sacrifice my home because of some of the decisions I made earlier on...

I checked a walk through and to save D6 you need to do absolutely everything correctly, that is my only issue with this game, besides that I loved it and would highly recommend this game to any FPS fan.

Check it out for sure!

In the halls of the funny Russian games that Yankees like to talk about whenever someone makes a joke about Russia, none have quite the weird mixed reputation as Metro. Half game, half synopsis of the novel series, and a game that defies any specific categorization. Is it a survival horror FPS? A story driven first person experience? A generic action game? Yes. Yes it can be all of those things and more for reasons no one but 4A understands. 

Last Light Redux is a remaster in a way that I legitimately can't notice and the only thing it does now is give you all the DLC from Last Light for free, which amounts to around 2-3 hours of side content and a few weapons that I used once. The Bigun really doesn't shock the balance of the game all that much. Beyond that and the lighting, it is the same basic game as the last one, and it's not the improvement that 2033 Redux is.

Following the ending of 2033 where Mr. Artyom and his fun friend the Rangers took over the bunker of D6, fought a long standing war with the Dark Ones and/or nuked them, you awaken to find D6 under threat. While you were gone on a nuclear genocide, the other denizens of the Metro, the Red Line and Fascists are vying for power, unifying their forces for one push to take the jewel of D6. It is up to you to prevent this, unlock more secrets to D6 and find out who is drinking all of the mushroom vodka. And bully Pavel. It's a story I don't notice, beyond being WICKED short and able to be ""completed"" in 10 hours flat. But I do notice the gameplay improvements.

Namely when you shot someone, they died and didn't eat half a mag of 5.45 before electing to perish today. I don't understand how STALKER and Metro 2033 shared the exact same weird spongey enemies but they do, and thankfully Last Light doesn't with a reworked combat system that makes it fun to fight people. And to stealth. And for the ability for me to customize my weapons rather than psychotically savescumming to remember which exact station had the suppressed and scoped Kalash 2013. And with a smidgen of new weapons to fit in the niches the other game left behind. Are they good? I dunno, I vaguely remember using the Ashot and the Lolife with a stock and suppressor made stealth too easy, so I suppose it's good.

This is a very good way to kill like 20 hours of your time, and usually for cheap on sale because 4A doesn't care. Pick it up for 10 bucks, lose a couple of nights to the funny Russian game, blow a bandit's face off with a shotgun, and then uninstall it and forget about it until ancient YouTube videos polluting your brain make you remember the game exists in the first place.

There's going to be vague spoilers throughout this review due to the connected nature of the series.

[h3]Enlightened[/h3]
While Metro: Last Light can be played isolated from the series, you will lose a considerable amount of context if you do. And perhaps to the game's own detriment, the linear, highly narratively-driven structure of the game makes it semi-unapproachable. Mild spoiler: The interesting about these first two games is that they have multiple endings but there is no mechanic to import any of these decisions into the next one. Making them feel slightly disjointed, if not ethereal or dreamlike — depending on your perspective, this may be seen as a positive thing. However, there are canon endings. The elusive but [i]hidden[/i] morality system is still present.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791414675

What's more is that after the events of Metro 2033, Artyom is made a Ranger in the Spartan Order. In addition to the specific reason as to why that occurred, Artyom's awareness and understanding of the world around him seems to grow [i]with[/i] the player. How the Metro works and the government therein, the monsters and ways to dispatch them. The feeling that Metro: Last Light gives off over its predecessor is not only a feeling that seems slightly more polished, but one that feels innately familiar. And not just because it's a horror-themed FPS.

The world building is slightly better than in Metro 2033, if only because it's built upon rather than an introduction.

[h3]Up your Arsenal[/h3]
Being a Ranger in the Spartan Order has its perks. For one, there's an increased set of weapons to use. More ammo types and more types of explosives. Interestingly, this makes the game much more action-focused even when playing in the default survival mode. You still need to manage your gas mask, filters and use military grade bullets (used as currency) for extra damage but there are very long, extended sequences where Artyom needs to trudge across the surface of Moscow or sneak through tunnels avoiding the Reich.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791414694

[b]Related diatribe:[/b] This is the same thing that Dead Space is criticized for — straying away from its survival horror roots for a more action-heavy game. At no point in this game was I concerned about rationing my ammo, medkits or filters on the default settings. I don't see this as innately negative as there are many of difficulty options. There are even a few encounters that are quite traditional boss battles, which in the context of a tense horror sequence only serve to remind me that I'm playing a video game. Like I had to figure out what to do to win this battle rather than simply survive. I just find it odd this game is not more criticized for the change in direction while Dead Space is. Condemned 2, the FEAR games — even the Crysis games take this path.

[h3]The Gist[/h3]
I don't think Last Light stands out as much as an isolated product compared to the original. But it has an okay campaign and serves as a narrative bridge into Exodus. So if you're concerned with story, it's a necessary antecedent. It's about the same length as Metro 2033 but it [i]feels[/i] shorter — I believe this is largely due to the game seeming less tense overall.

If I wanted stealth, I would play Metal Gear Solid or Dishonored.

But if you don´t mind stealth, you might enjoy this game.

UPDATE: the in-game menus are bad. I was buying the wrong ammo for the guns I had. (I discovered this the worst way, having to reload and finding no ammo available). So, after ""dying"", I had to go back to the ammo dealer. In the buy/sell ammo menu, there was no way to know which was for which. So I had to go back to combat, and while reloading, memorize the icon of the ammo for each gun. 
I´m pretty sure I´ve lost a reasonable amount of money with those wrong trades, in a game where ammo is already scarce...

UPDATE> I´ve always wondered why I didn´t like the Metro and S.T.A.L.K.E.R, but never could my finger on it...
Now I know. It´s because of the gas masks.
Although it´s a cool concept, especially in a post-apocalypse scenario, you know what they are?
They are timers.
Avery time you have to wear a gas mask, you´re on a timer.

Since I never like timed missions, I don´t like missions with gas masks.

I will still try this one a little more, but, I like to take my time to address the situation and plan my moves, and a countdown over my have just adds to stress, not a cool, positive adrenaline.

Narrative is greatly improved, but has a very long way to go yet. Gun-play is still clumsy; hit registry and/or enemy durability is still disproportionately spongy or easy to kill; and enemy A.I. is still erratic and unrefined at times. Music and use of music has improved; screenplay/storytelling is much improved, but still very erratic relatively frequently; and exploration and the meaning of choices have been improved. Unfortunately, unrewarding exploration; dead-ends; and death traps are still present in the game, albeit at a reduced rate (by about 2/3rds).

Missing journal entries can obfuscate the entire premise of story arcs; choices don't appear to have meaningful consequences; and character building and interactions are still weak for certain characters. However, for other characters, development is much stronger - again, showcasing the Metro series' extremes of strengths and weakness.

The game is considerably longer than Metro: 2033; coming in at just over double the play time (for a total play time of about 18 hours, if going at a slower pace); thus, making the game more worthwhile to play. Replay value has also been increased, but is still not very high.

Prone to crashing, as well as becoming unresponsive.

Again, I would love to love this series more, but they need a lot of work to be considered even ""good"" games. This one - compared to Metro: 2033 - however, is more of a very rough diamond, as opposed to an interesting, but highly compromised experience. I would recommend this only for those that are willing and able to see past its technical problems, and disjointed (and problematic) narrative and gameplay; desiring something that is different in tone; atmosphere; and story content than most games. For hardcore gamers, or intrepid narrative and/or gameplay enthusiasts only.

Should I give it a 10/10? No, it has some bugs here and there and the AI is effectively generic nonsense. What carries this game is definitely not the enemies, the combat, or the gameplay, but the story and the lore, the ambiance. I have read the books and finished all of the games multiple times. I believe that of all of the three games, Last Light might be the weakest of the series, but it is still an amazing entry in this franchise. The story drags a bit more than necessary and I still dislike the hidden karma system where you can brutalize every individual in the game, but you just can't kill some dude and you receive a good ending. I would prefer choices that are a bit more obvious. Most of the good karma choices in the game I consider to be unwise and naive. Oh, another negative, Khan is a hipster now...pfff
Anyway, take my review as an expression of love, the game is absolutely amazing!

You will have to play for a young guy, Artyom, whom we will not see in the process of passing. The game from the first person and all the horror that is happening in the subway, we will see with our own eyes. The whole game consists of: a prologue and seven chapters, which in turn are divided into sections. When passing the game, you will meet many NPCs, for the most part they are stupid and will not be able to provide all possible assistance, except to distract the enemy. Artificial intelligence, in the form of enemies, is weak.
There are two main modes of passing the game - Survival and Spartan. You can select subsections according to the complexity of the interface and the level of the game: standard, hardcore, ranger, ranger hardcore. The last two modes are especially tough, tips, sights, some information have been removed, opponents have been strengthened - they are really difficult and difficult to pass.
There are not many types of opponents in the game, monsters and people. And judging by the plot of the game, people are scarier.
Basically, the whole game takes place on two main locations, the surface and the actual subway.
As for the items the character uses, there aren't many of them. The choice of weapons in the game is not very wide, mainly firearms that can be modified, depending on the style of the game. Pleased with inventory restrictions, it is impossible to use more than two types of weapons, the supply of ammunition and medicines is limited. Pleased with the combat mode, the enemy can kill you with a couple of blows or shots.
The game can be played in stealth mode, but the NPCs that keep you company sometimes get in the way.
I can't say that the graphics are outstanding. It is difficult to evaluate the graphic component of the game, which was released in 2010. But I think that for the release of the game on Play Station 4, the graphics were tightened up.
The developers devoted a lot of time and effort to the sound implementation in the project, which is only worth the chant of Mikhail Krug's song ""Vladimirsky Central"", the character of Bourbon, with whom Artyom travels. In general, all the dialogues are worked out, and if you wander around the stations and listen to what the NPCs are talking about, you can sometimes hear very touching and soul-stirring stories.
In general, it is interesting to play the game using headphones. The sounds of what is happening around sometimes made me shudder, more abruptly than the vaunted Hollywood horror films.
I did not quite like the linearity of the plot, there is no possibility to choose non-standard solutions. There are two choices at the end of the game. Maybe all this is connected with the events described in the Metro 2033 book. But in general, the plot catches and holds for causal places until the very end.
In general, throughout the entire game, you can feel the special atmosphere of the game, which will be understood by people from the CIS and is unlikely to be understood by foreigners, for them this is an ordinary horror shooter.

The sequel to Metro 2033: Last Light (Ray of Hope), was released in 2013. The developer and publisher remained the same; 4A Game and Deep Silver. The plot for this game was the second book by Dmitry Glukhovsky.

In general, the concept and atmosphere of the game has remained at the same level, which is excellent. Continuation of the story about the guy Artyom, who became a hero and a legend in the world of Metro.
Compared to Metro 2033, the graphics have improved significantly. As in the first, so in the second parts, the realization of precipitation and weather events was pleasing.
From linearity, the game has not gone anywhere, but the plot has been twisted so much that it was a pleasant surprise when passing the game. The storyline is turned upside down in an instant.
Management remains the same, intuitive and not particularly tricky. It is difficult to say whether the controls are convenient on the PC, I really liked the controls on the PlayStation. A significant number of various weapons have been added to the game, while maintaining the possibility of modification. It is possible to choose weapons for different styles of play.
The sound in the game is at the same level, just as scary and interesting. Artificial intelligence (opponents) was left at the same level, but it seemed to me that the stealth mode was finalized.
In total, the game has 30 chapters that you pass in one breath. As in the previous part, there are two options for the ending of the game.
The second part did not spoil the Metro 2033 universe, but rather added and shook it up.

Now let's go over the main disadvantages of this game.
This game has a decent amount of bugs, boxes flying away when you touch them. The corpses of opponents fall into the texture. Decently strained replicas of the NPCs who traveled with the main character. When you run, you study something, and in the background there is a comment: ""Well, where are you already ..."" and so many times, it was annoying.
It is not possible to create a save, if you are playing the game on ranger difficulty and cannot complete the story due to a lack of filters for a gas mask, you need to restart the game.",1646500764,1646500843,True,2,1,0.543215394020080566,0,True,False,False

it introduces the mechanics way better than 2033, and the story is more prevalent.
however, i was still lost on what was happening?
and since i wasn't enjoying myself as much as i was with the last one i found myself getting impatient and just wanting the game to end.

the way it introduces the mechanics of the game makes it feel as if this should've been the first installment (i know that storywise this doesn't make sense). however with the story taking the spotlight- and my continued confusion as to what was going one- i found myself not having as much fun, and quickly became impatient.

In terms of gameplay little is done to update or improve the formula, nonetheless there are other aspects of the game such as it´s story and the characters that are clearly (in my own opinion) improved in comparison to the first game.
In terms of storytelling, i believe the story is more interesting since it adapts the aspects of the post apocalyptic Moscow but the story it contains some detalis i think the first game didn´t dare to. For example, i believe that the character of the little dark one as a moral companion for the character is a better than just a white flare in the screen whenever you do something either good or bad. The kid is a way to make us care about what we do, mainly because the kid will learn from what we do. It is a nice touch, idk.
The ""good"" characters, which are our allies are developed better but the ""enemies"".... well, they are the so known ""Baddies"" and they could have made it better.
The ambient is similar to the first game so i do not have further comments other than we are on the outside in more oportunities than 2033 which allows to see the decay of the world we once inhabited.
I recommend all 3 games of this saga, each one improves aspects from it´s predecessor and thats something i can be thankfull for.

In terms of gameplay, it's pretty much identical to Metro 2033 Redux. The realistic aspect of managing your equipment is very enjoyable. Wiping your gas mask feels extremely satisfying. As with the first game, you could choose to go stealth or guns blazing although the game tends to lean more towards action this time around. There is heavy emphasis on story with great voice work and dialogue that is slightly hindered by a less subtle approach in storytelling. Additionally, one of your partners, Anna, seemed out of place with rather weak writing but compensated for by having short screen time.

The story is good; Pavel is a very well-written character with charisma that didn't come across as over-the-top or irritating. Anna's writing is truly [b] abysmal [/b] (FAR more competently written in Exodus) and one scene in particular was cringe-overload.
Miller's arc was also good. Nice to see him for more than just a gruff-military-guy; good setup to his development in Exodus.  

Outside of the story, I particularly enjoy the Kshatriya DLC; it's kind of a mini-Exodus in a way. Go out, retrieve things, return to base, but it takes place in the metro.

I really like the weapon design they used for these Metro games. Most of these weapons look and feel like they were cobbled together from scrap parts by mechanics living in a wasteland (which is exactly how they are made). I also love the weapon customization options you are given.

The story is quite interesting, although not unique. Listening to enemy dialogue is fun while sneaking around. And there is a morality system in play. Based on your actions, you can get one of two different endings.

In every mission/area, it's either you go loud or sneak past the enemies (not all). The stealth mechanics of Metro is kind of unrealistic compared to Dishonored.

- You know when you get trapped in a narrow maze of tunnels in an FPS and you're simultaneously railroaded down a very narrow path but it's hard to figure out the exact path you're supposed to take? That's this game, all the time.

- You spend so much of the game just doing what a companion tells you, or pressing buttons because your HUD orders you to.

- It's a ""stealth"" game with enemies who can't see you even if you walk right under their nose, or shoot a pistol half a meter from their head. The non-human enemies are ridiculous and absolutely no fun to fight.

- It has an incredibly depressing vibe and a really weird macho tone, like being stuck in an ad for Monster energy drink.

- While wandering around, you find notes strewn about which apparently are... written by you, describing what is happening at right that minute?

The environments are beautiful, the stealth is still janky but better.

Level design has been greatly improved and there are a lot of cool mechanics.

Gun upgrades are still meh, but there are a lot more guns to try. Sadly you cans till only carry 3 so you won't try them all out.

The game does drag on in some parts, but at least it gives you interesting things to look at. It does get a bit repetitive with the gameplay loop and could use some different secrets to find.

The levels are very confusing and if you want to go stealth, you have to restart whole levels because the checkpoints are very far apart from each other. Some boss fights aren't as intuitive as they should have been and are really frustrating.

[h1]📄 Review of Metro Last Light Redux [/h1]
[/quote]

[quote]
Metro: Last Light Redux is a 2013 post-apocalyptic-themed, first-person shooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements. It was developed by 4A Games and published by Deep Silver.
As the sequel to Metro 2033 it has similar gameplay which is fairly linear mostly threw the tunnels in the metro but also on the surface. You play Artyom to find the Dark One. On your mission you encounter members of the Soviet Red Line and Nazi Fourth Reich who are trying to stop you. As a First-Person Shooter the gunplay is a big part of the game. Ammunition is very rare in the post-apocalyptic environment which gives the game an additional layer of atmosphere. The world is designed appropriately and carries this feeling even further.

AI of enemies is sometimes strange, because they do see you hidden somewhere and sometimes they do not see/hear you just behind their back, so many times it was like ""aaah I do not give dam, and I will not load it only because this last idiot >>killing spree<<""; All mentioned things I do not like on this version of Metro are solved in Exodus, which is 1000x more interesting, mainly because of variability of missions. But this game is really good ""dungeon"" and all my thoughts are just complains because I have seen next game from same word, and its SOOO much more fine-tuned.

Sadly it's hard to enjoy through the sea of jank this game has. 

-Sound design is bad, literally can't hear people if you turn around. Also expect cheap stock sounds for everything
-English dub is kinda terrible
-Non-adjustable FOV is super low and makes it uncomfortable to play. You can adjust it in the game files but it breaks some visual effects and cut-scenes. Still a good trade off.
-Kinda bad scripting everywhere, specially with NPCs all talking at the same time.
-Ranger mode kinda unplayable in some places if you don't know exactly what you are supposed to do.
-Gunplay isn't really satisfying either, just gotta hope things are dying when you shoot
-Stealth mechanics are a bit better than before but still super basic, and they are a big part of the game unless you wanna get shot to death in 5 seconds.

If you liked the previous game, still worth playing but just be ready for the many, many technical shortcomings it has. It also seems to crash randomly. Funny enough, performance isn't bad. I recommend lowering the brightness tho because the game by default is a bit too bright.

I played short cuts some chapters, every 10 seconds character was dying without gas mask. How a ranger going to missions without supply of any gas mask at all very strange. If you keep look around blindly like a hobo or drank, you will have gas masks to go through some chapters which could be really interesting and adventurous other than disturbing.

You can only fight with the humans in this game, they will let you kill most of them in shadow mode like hobos. I only liked the fight on the train which was real action and fight with compact logic. I ran with life in the bridge because the game has foolish logic to ruin adventure and action. It is fine that animals can move fast and aim should be difficult, but if the character does not get no space to move it will become disturbing. Two magazines full of shots cant kill the animals, why do you play actually ?

I liked the Metro Exodus, that one is total mature logic and realistic game without unnecessary bull shit to ruin the test and mood of action and adventure.

All in all Last Light is a big step back for me and while that hurts to say, it's the truth.

I love this genre of games, and actually had never played the series so I wanted to check them out. What the developers got right was the atmosphere and story. All 3 games are beautiful and the environment is immersive and there's so much story line and conversations you can have with randoms. Last light visuals were delightfully improved from 2033. Unfortunately, I felt my experience was plagued by some bad mechanics that just simply ruined full immersion and made much of the combat and exploration frustrating and not fun at all.

Most of the combat with mutant creatures was still unsatisfying like in 2033, their movements were often jerky and unnatural. The damage required to kill the same creatures was inconsistent, one shot to kill one creature, 4-5 to kill another identical creature.

Stealth was also inconsistent. Often times an enemy was able to spot me through a 1 inch gap in a wall in full darkness. And most of the time, even when killing an enemy stealthily with a throwing knife, every other enemy in the entire map was immediately made aware and ran straight for my position. As far as I could tell, it was nearly impossible to pass any stage stealthily without someone noticing.

Combat with the human elements in the game was by far the most satisfying, but the AI was often pretty simple and overall not too challenging. If these mechanics were a little bit more refined, I think I would have enjoyed the series quite a bit more.

I didn't read any of the Metro books before buying the game, but it doesn't really matter. It was humorous how Anna was all about being tough and strong as a woman in the military and a bit distant with me since she hardly even knew me be but later on, she wanted just anybody to make her feel like ""being alive"" and she chose me in desperation.  I'm just an available warm body of a man it appears.

Yes, this game can be very brutal if you don't use different strategies and tactics like conserving gas mask filters and ammo. You have to approach this game with the goal of learning something about yourself and the importance to change strategies as situations change. Not every battle requires you to kill everything in sight. Sometimes it’s best to run away  🏃  or sneak away just to save your life while saving limited resources especially gas mask filters.

I've played the original, I played it once through on PS3 and 4 respectively, and once more on PC with the redux.  After you play a game so much you really start to see its flaws, but that goes with everything.  Visual and audio glitches, enemies spawning right in front of you, cover sometimes just doesn't work, and your shadow glitches the hell out.  And yet it is still one of the most captivating story driven FPSs I've ever played, on par with the greats like Half-Life and Bioshock.  Even with its short comings the games gunplay, story, and atmosphere save it completely.

I think this is mostly helped by the fact that the last few levels are some of the best.  I always forget, after Pavel leaves, the story really starts to drag.  It's not bad but you sort of meander around until about half way through the game where the main story finally catches up.  It's all still amazing but the second half of the game is rather forgettable.

Also, as a note if you are going to play this, play on Ranger difficulty.  I don't mean this in a ""get gud"" or hardcore gamer sort of way I mean the game is way to easy and boring on normal.  Even if your not very good at FPSs it's still worth it.

Namely, balance is crap. It doesn't feel good to shoot enemies in this game, humans are somewhat encouraging, but both damage dealt and taken should be buffed greatly. I can understand taking 3 shots to kill a mutant, but not when there are 20 mutants to kill and only 20 ammo lying around, with no option to switch weapons either.

I was particularly upset by a certain ""boss"" that literally did nothing except eat ammo to the face, which was the weak spot. 60 shells from a fully upgraded saiga + 180 assault rifle rounds and it's still not dead. I spent all my grenades knives, claymores, and ammo just to kill it. And I was lucky to carry an assault rifle because I needed another 90 MGRs to finish it off, as it would otherwise not die.

The story is a bit longer in this title but feels disjointed. A love interest is introduced early in the game and then all but abandoned near-instantly, making her a constant question of ""why does this scene exist,"" followed by more confusion. Artyom is knocked out for nearly every level transition which makes it feel like I'm missing small things that could be interesting (and I could be, if they'd done *anything* with these transitions). The level design stays the same familiar and classic linear area with small storytelling moments occasionally, offering a familiar claustrophobic underground environment for about half of the game and long treks across the surface that feel rushed and confused for the other half. 

The karma system makes a return with the same frustrating and inane feeling decisions if you want the ""good"" end. There are no improvements here, just more points can be earned here by doing nothing or avoiding confrontation than in 2033.

The combat system is completely unchanged from 2033, however we are given a significantly larger pool of guns to choose from. If you play Ranger Hardcore as I did, however, the vast majority of these guns will be inaccessible for you either due to ammo consumption, lack of ammo, or inability to obtain a world spawn of the weapon because you can't earn enough bullets to buy the gun (thanks Hellbreath). Overall, the guns look better and with wider variety but you'll see so few for most of the campaign that they might as well not exist.

Overall, the main story is a miss for me, the karma system is still a miss for me, but the guns and stealth still feel good enough that they'll get you through the game.",1641419173,1641419173,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Pretty much everthing is better, the story is more engaging and personal to Artyom (its more about Redemption). The gameplay is better, and the game is overall longer.

The only downside is you're going to have to jump through some f*cking hoops to try and get the true ending, and I mean really go out of your way and jump through hoops, for instance you can't engage combat too early since you need to listen in on certain dialogue, you can't kill certain people and you have to find certain tunnels. Oh and btw if you even f*ck up once and accidently kill the wrong person just once... then the true ending is locked out for you,

Which is a damn shame since the true ending, known as Redemption ending. Is so good. I recommend looking it up on youtube rather than try to jump through all these hoops.

[b]Metro: Last Light[/b] improves upon the first game in every conceivable way. They even fixed the stealth so that it’s actually viable now. 

There are some problems, mainly the way they paced the difficulty. The game gets unforgivingly hard in some spots. 

For example, there’s this awkward part where you’re waiting for a raft and the game decides the entire room is lit and stealth is no longer an option even though it had been for basically the whole game until that point. It caught me by surprise and looking around the Steam forums it seems a lot of people had problems with this exact place.

There are also two even worse areas towards the very end of the game that are incredibly frustrating: one where you are given a power-up that’s supposed to help but it only actually makes the fight harder because you can’t see properly. And the second being an obnoxious boss fight. 

Still, difficulty pacing aside, this was [b]exactly[/b] what I was looking for in Metro. The world is depicted in a much more grimdark way than in the original and they don’t shy away from delving into the horrors of the post-apocalypse in a much more grown-up way than something like Fallout. 

I played through the game twice, once in English and once in Russian, and I have to say Russian was really the way to go here. The English voice acting is not up to par and relies on what feels like amateur voice actors faking accents. It’s awful. One thing I would like to see would be an “Immersive” voice acting option. Basically, there are German soldiers in the game. If I pick Russian voice acting, they all speak Russian. If I pick German voice acting, then all the Russians speak German. Would be nice to have Germans speak German when you understand German, you know? 

All in all, I really enjoyed my time with the game and recommend at least giving it a shot even if you didn’t like [B]Metro 2033[/B].",1641145842,1641146070,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-I like the story 
-The guns, even the bastard gun
-The sound effects is just on point
-Characters and interactions with them feel real
-It's not afraid to show the bad things that can or might happen in something that's post-apocalyptic

This game at times desperately tried to pretend to be COD or some fast pace FPS shooter despite none of the games' mechanics make that enjoyable. Quite the contrary every single mechanic in this game tell you not to get into a gunfight out in the open, however the game itself FORCES you to do so in multiple missions. Its almost like whoever made this game has a mind of a 3yo and simply stole the IP to do make their own fanfic game.

Story: Complete garbage.
1.) Abrupt and meaningless romance - meaningless in the sense that NOTHING happened/changed besides a implicated sex scene. IT has no proper development and did not provide any personal growth.
2.) You earn ""good boy points"" by not killing people who uses biological warfare, and they DID NOT show an ounce of remorse to justify it. You basically let war criminals go free and the game consider this the moral option.
3.) Khan the fucking xenophile. [spoiler]The only reason why he is right is because the game made it so. None of his decision or what he spoke were actually rational. You killed the dark ones because you believe that they also wanted to cause harm on you. They had driven your people crazy as the metro people were struggling to fight off the mutants. The dark ones themselves also wanted to kill you when you were trying to shoot the missiles at them. There was no genuine way to actually communicate with them and therefore the rational decisions were to destroy them. Seek forgiveness my ass. I don't see them apologising for the people they terrorised and I don't see them helping anyone in the first game. Khan is an impulsive hippy that does whatever he wants and the reason why the rangers did not rightfully shoot him or kick him out was because of plot armour. In fact Khan is the embodiment of the plot itself, and everything that is shit about the story.[/spoiler]
4.) One particular scene: [spoiler] Your ""love interest"" is kidnapped and you have gone to save her. You are confronting the kidnapper, and the kidnapper is holding a knife against the girl's throat. The game let you aim, so you pull out your sniper rifle and aim at the kidnapper's head at almost point blank range. You fire, and the kidnapper is completely fine. He pushes the girl towards you, and your gas mask cracked. I don't understand why they idn't just make this a cutscene considering how stupid the scene was. You are supposed to surrender to the kidnapper so they just forced the scene upon you so that they can go back to their linear story-telling. 

Gameplay: Everything bad in the first game + abhorrent ""boss fights"" 
1.) Despite the environment being extremely blend, boring and colourless, the devs did not put sound queue prior to enemy attacks. Theres only nosalis hows prior to a wave of attack (no clear sound when they actually attack) and in the swamp sections theres almost always enemy noises that does not amount to anything. In case anyone wants to argue that this is realistic, I recommend you to stop playing this game for 2 weeks each time you get attack, and delete your save whenever you died instead of reloading. You do not excuse poor design as realism. 
2.) There is only 2 new enemy types in this game iirc. It's a bit disappointing but not a huge problem.
3.) Guns are fine.
4.) Boss fights/final fights are the worst part of this game. The entire theme of this game is mostly stealth, avoid confrontations and fight only when you have to. Instead you are forced to fight bosses or large groups of enemies in the open. Worse yet, your rifle is equipped with IR scope so you cant see shit when theres fire and explosion everywhere. These fights are fundamentally against the core gameplay this game was designed around. 

You run around in a small arena to have a bullet diarrhoea on the monster - why? Then, another ""boss"" fight had you getting pinned down by 6-8 snipers - why? Later in the aforementioned sniper fight, you have to fight your way up a staircase - just kidding, by that I mean you have to shoot a immortal enemy until he backs down - he is almost guaranteed to land his shot on you every time he peeks, and thats also the only time you can shoot him, and you have to force him to back down three times. In the final fight, you have to fight off waves of enemies WITH GUN in an OPEN battlefield with less cover than your bulllshit skimpy female armour in RPGs - WHY? And then you fight a fucking ""tank"" by firstly shooting its rail, then the wheels and finally its ammunition storage - but only in that order, because obviously the exposed ammunition will be invincible unless you destroy the tank's rail and wheel first, and there is no other way to damage a tank, its not like molotov or incendiary grenades exist.

DLC mission: heavy squad - even more unplayable than the last fight - more open battle, no cover and constant bombardment by the enemy so that your screen always shakes. IT DOES NOT WORK.",1640000016,1640190691,False,1,0,0.474247574806213379,0,True,False,False

While Metro 2033 had a thin plot, it did the job and wasn't distracting from all the fun the game provided thanks to original setting and... well, shooting.
Unfortunately the sequel is more ambitious and tries to tell a story... it's just a really bad one.

To give a short version of the major judgement: The difficulty of the game on the lowest setting brings a challenge to bear which is far greater than the ""good"" ending is worth. Alongside their invalidating the effort of the player in 2033, I really don't think they have the right to tell me anything about how I interact with a fictional universe that isn't even theirs, nor do they get to pass judgement on my actions.
Basically, don't do their challenge. Just enjoy the game and the universe as it was meant to be, a brutal and savage post apocalyptic survival shooter. Read the books if you want the story, but don't listen to the dev's contrived and hidden black and white bullshit. Sparing murderers and rapists is not a good thing. Killing isn't always the best solution, but in a world literally incapable of keeping cannibals, rapists, and serial killers locked up and in check it becomes necessary. It is the duty of the strong to protect the weak, not control them. To allow elements to continue to exist which believes it is their duty to enforce their will and control those unable to fight for themselves yields suffering in numbers far too great to immediately comprehend. Revolutions, a revolving circle of suffering and death. Injustices repaid and repeated over countless cycles.

TL;DR: The devs tried to be philosophers, and failed either by enforcing disconnected utopic ideals, or because they're shit at game design. Just enjoy the game, and learn to be better by actual introspective thought. Grab a book to help, if you need to, but not this game. Honestly, it's not even as thought provoking as the first.",1638799445,1638799445,True,3,2,0.519291877746582031,0,True,False,False

I had played Metro 2033 Redux before and long story short, even years after release it's basically an early access game. It was ridden with technical difficulties that hampered my experience. I was stupid enough however to buy both games together so here I am again. I was warned this time though and expecting problems so here I went.
The game did not start in full screen, in stead taking up a corner of the screen but with no borders. I looks for the fullscreen setting but there was no such thing. Changed the video settings to my liking and restarted. This time it booted up in fullscreen for some reason.
Now, my computer is high level enough that it should be able to play this game in 4K resolution on the highest settings and still get more then 60fps... But even the main menu was unusable at 4K. 2K wasn't much better. Had to lower to 1080p for even the main menu to work. Finally booted up the campaign and no visible tearing or stuttering.
However, I play with a controller and movement was slow but looking around with the right stick was unbearably slow. I go to the settings and there's two options: ""Aim sensitivity"" and ""sensitivity"". Right stick is for aiming so I put that on maximum. No change noticable. Then I put sensitivity to maximum and that helps but it's still slow. On top of that, looking up and down is slightly slower then right or left.
I try to live with it for a bit longer as I just want to do something at this point. I have to go to the settings menu once again though because since I'm over 30 I have to put the volume of voices up and the rest down in every game. It's normally the first thing I do. So I go to audio settings and... Metro might be the first game I've ever seen that does not have a setting for voice volume. Neither is there one for background sounds. Only master and music volume sliders...

The atmosphere is fantastic, every location is unique, the characters are well written, and you never feel more than a wrong turn away from death.

For a linear, story-driven game, it does a amazing job of making you feel exposed and at-risk the whole time.

I have one large complaint, and it is the same as my complaint with the first game, and that is the ending (no spoilers).

Like the first game, there are two endings, a ""good"" (secret) ending and a ""bad"" ending. You are very unlikely to see the good ending unless you pull it up on youtube, because there is a litany of things you have to do during the playthrough to get it. Even knowing about this mechanic ahead of time and adjusting my play-style throughout the whole game I was unable to achieve the good ending and I have no idea why. There is no indication during the game as to what ending you are going to get until the end.

So my assumption is that unless you follow a step-by-step guide you are unlikely to get the good ending, which is frustrating, because the bad ending is pretty bad. They should have scrapped the standard ending and just kept the secret ending as the default.

On top of that, you don't actually get the full dtory unless you watch BOTH endings, so even if you DO get the good ending you should go to YouTube to see what you missed.",1638225036,1638225036,True,8,0,0.60300600528717041,0,True,False,False

It has a better environmental design IMO than 2033, especially in regards to the cities of the Metro like Venice, and it really gives you the feel of how humanity had to adapt their surroundings and live with what they got.

However some levels are very long with a bunch of unnecessary exploring and too many enemies, and the story is not so engaging as the first game, as this is mostly a redemption story about the canon choice made by the protagonist in the first game.

Mechanically the game is identical to the first, but with a bigger budget. As before, you're mostly going to be guided by NPCs through corridors while following on a linear story. The story is a string of unfortunate and extremely unlikely events that culminate in a great final showdown. The cutscenes are generally a lot more interesting and have more action in them. Overall it was a really good, memorable experience (both games together) and had a proper ending. Still don't know who the Dark Ones are. Still a bit buggy.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Much better action cutscenes
- Still great voice acting
- Has a rather clever unintrusive way of guiding you if you get lost. Your lighter flame waves in the direction of your objective
- The game starts out fighting Nazis, which is way more interesting mechanically than monsters that just charge straight at you
- I found all the factions living in the underground pretty interesting
- I think all the guns were basically the same as the first game, maybe with the addition of a couple of sniper rifles (which you don't really have a chance to use

[b]Cons[/b]
- It still never explains who the Dark Ones are
- Given that these are based on books, I feel like quite a lot must have been lost in the translation to video game. There are sections that I just didn't understand, and points where the plot suddenly changed and I didn't really understand why
- Scripted events are still buggy
- There's a key cutscene about 2/3 of the way through the game that suddenly changes the whole plot. But because there are no words, I found it pretty confusing
- It's exactly the same engine, so all the same pitfalls as the first game in terms of mechanics and UI
- I found it difficult to work out what was going on in terms of story telling, no thanks to the main character being mute and the game taking a rather weird turn in the last couple of hours
- Awful section with a tank at the end of the game. You're getting shot at from every direction, and you're supposed to just magically know that you have to use a sniper rifle to shoot a wheel bar, then two wheels, THEN then turret on top. Oh and not every sniper rifle will do; even after Googling it, I died and reloaded twice more because I was using the 'wrong sniper rifle'",1472462671,1635241661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Personally not a fan of games that only give you different endings based on choice where some of the ""choice"" isn't obvious. Meaning you don't know shooting the crane guy or the surrendering Nazi was a bad thing till afterwards and you get the bad sound effect. Some people love the complexity but honestly I just want to get into a story and enjoy it vs trying to make sure I have a story I enjoy by examining every possible thing I do as a morale or imorale act that will get me a ""good"" ending. I enjoyed the variety of weapons but again would have liked an addtional weapon slot to have 1 sidearm, 1 assault stlye weapon, 1 shotgun, 1 percison weapon. Idk why the semi auto pistol has to use the same ammo as the revolver as it makes it come down to either high damage or high fire rate. between those two and a the astov you could have a loadout well suited to both surface and tunnels if you wanted the challenge of pistol class only. The valve is by far my favorite though the 4x scope is highly useless both in the tunnels and on the surface irons worked just fine for me and theres a red dot if you need something more percise. over all a good game just didnt like the karma choices 24/7 to effect how the game ended.",1635017473,1635017473,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Amazing storyline - actually one of the games I'm not questioning the plot, it all flows very nicely from the previous Metro game. The story also fills in plotholes you'd have if you never played the other Metro games. I'd give it a 9/10. 

Awesome weapon concepts - Customization of weapons in this game is very cool and not like MOST of its contemporaries. You  have a sight attachment, a barrel attachment and can put all other attachments on in the 3rd section (I forgot what it's called) and having that many attachments is weird, unique and cool at the same time. It's like something you'd see in a Call of Duty campaign, but the multiplayer [Of Call of Duty] would lack it. I'd give this an 8/10, only somewhat innovative.

Unique enemies - These enemies are either strong as hell and insanely hard to kill, very strong but their weakness kills them, or weak and strong in numbers. They have unique concepts and are even differing from the other Metro games. I played the previous one and recognized 0 of the the enemies. ex. One of the enemies has a weakness to light, so you can crank up your flashlight (like the intensity of the light) and burn it to submission and then shoot it once or twice. Due to the fact that the enemies are completely different (from what I remember) from the previous Metro game and are unlike nearly all enemies in this genre, I'd give this a 10/10. 

No real 6-7 qualities of this game.

Cons(5-1): Be wary there are spoilers here.

Expectability: This game has such a huge level of expectability, from the betrayl of the friend you make in the beginning to the obvious coming sex scene aforementioned. This isn't game shattering or anything, in fact most games play out this way so it's not really a new experience. This gets a 4/10.

Puzzles: Although some are fun, some are awful. Normally in games like Bioshock if you're having trouble there's that little cloud of dust that points you where to go. This game does not have that, and this leads to you being stuck in a room for 15 minutes suffocating w/o a gas mask because you can't figure out what the frick to do. This gets a 2/10 just because of the awful moments presented in the game.

OVERALL: There are more aspects I can touch on here, but for your sake and mine let's just end this here. This game is awesome, the cons are not even enough to kill the game. It's enough to get you pissed, but not enough to ruin the enjoyment as a whole. Honestly this game is cool as hell, and the bad spots are actually few and far between.

In all the missions you have someone teaming and helping you out and that's what I like about this game that varies from the other metro franchise.

The good:
- Great atmosphere, which is the primary reason why you should play metro games. The lighting, settings, sounds, music all adds up for a phenomenal experience
- The gunplay is very satisfying and well done, I say this after playing Ranger mode, so no idea what the normal mode is like
- The story is pretty well done imo and has good progression. I also like the core message of the game, all though I wouldn't go as far as forgive ""certain people""
- The stealth sections are pretty cool (if the checkpoints dont fuck up)
- The music, it slaps.

Some complaints I have:
- The moral points system is still total trash, but this time you cant ignore it because the ""good ending"" is the canon ending. So if you want the real ending be ready to play the game with a guide. This took a lot of the enjoyment out of the game for me, so I suggest everyone who plays this to just go for the bad ending and not look at guides
- The crashes, I had to restart levels multiple times because the game kept crashing, very infuriating. I think I had 20-30 crashes in total and they definitely cost me a few hours
- Black screen bug, where the screen would randomly go black sometimes for no apparent reason
- Checkpoints, my god. Imagine you just having done a very long stealth section and then getting spotted just to get send back to the beginning of the level because IT WASNT A CHECKPOINT. Infuriating, this is why quick saves are a necessity in these kinda games.
- It feels less survival-esque than 2033, in 2033 I was constantly out of ammo despite playing on spartan, in this game I had like 300 MGRs at all times, which meant I literally could just spam my gun and not care basically, this also dampered the survival atmosphere of the game.",1634572719,1634572719,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Metro Last Light is unique and it ages well. One of the most underrated survival horror games.
Amazingly linear game, the more you play, the better it gets!
Should give it a try if you're a fan of the combination of survival horror, immersive atmosphere, first-person shooter, emotional story, and stealthy gameplay.

Ammo management, gun's customization... pretty much the same mechanic as Metro 2033.
Must manually increase FOV to suit your taste!
Good/Bad ending depending on how you play the game. You don't choose which ending by dialogue but decide to be a good/bad guy from start to finish.
You might learn some valuable life lessons from this game too!

The levels are still a series of carefully crafted set pieces but now with the addition of new enemy types as well as boss fights and a grand last stand. This is a finely crafted first person shooter, and a great instalment to the metro series.

- Great gameplay with a wide variety of enemies and locations
- Interesting, atmospheric level design that is extremely engaging
- Fantastic soundtracks
- Plenty of areas to explore that help make the linear design of the levels seem more open, alive and believable places that have been lived in
- Fun and engaging progression with more guns becoming available as you progress
- Military grade ammunition being your main currency as well as being usable ammunition, which in itself can create some quite tense and difficult decisions, particularly on the higher difficulty settings.

However, neither of these are completely flawless experiences:

- The morality system is by far my largest criticism of this game. It is ambiguous, bizarre and can sometimes appear to be downright asinine. Moral actions are all valued equally meaning that strumming a balalaika that's lying in the corner of your gaff will be considered as moral as saving a persons life. For some reason the game will also reward you with moral points in very strange and random places. Such as for perving in on two naked women cleaning themselves or following complete randos around listening to their conversations, or doing something as simple as just walking into a room or turning a corner. You could go through the whole game killing as many people as possible but still get the good ending because you strummed enough balalaika's and listened to enough pointless dialogue and found some secret areas. This in itself kind of makes the whole system look ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that the game seems to think sparing Communists, Nazis and Bandits who pose an imminent danger to those around them is a moral thing to do. The way this system should have been handled is that it should have only been applied to key moments and plot points that were more clear, consistent and engaging imo.
- Both stories for Metro 2033 and Last Light are serviceable and have their ups and downs, with some characters being weaker than others. Khan is an intriguing character present in both 2033 and Last Light, who's background is shrouded in mystery, leaving the audience to fill in the gaps with their own imagination, while having consistent motivations that makes sense. Anna on the other hand is a character that is introduced in Last Light and goes from hating the player's character at the beginning to falling in love with them when you meet her again halfway through the game with little indication as to why this complete switch in personality happened during your time apart.
-The AI can be a bit buggy and at times. In my experience only leading to a couple of frustrating situations with mutants one shotting you or an enemy seeing you through a wall or in a dark area but these moments are few and far between and kind of to be expected, overall the AI gets the job done and is pretty good on the whole.

Overall Metro Last Light and 2033 are both fun and engaging experiences that I highly recommend. The negative points are vastly outweighed by the positives but I still thought it was necessary to elaborate on my criticisms.",1633540794,1633544470,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is great, arguably better than the first game, with an intriguing villain that really caught me off guard and amazing set pieces. Level design in this game it top tier, with large amounts diversity to allow you to play the game you want. From claustrophobic tunnels to the rainy bright surface, this game visuals are breathtaking. The audio design is amazing, as you creep around corners hearing different mutated monsters screeching filling you with paranoia. Only complaint is Artym being a mute protagonist, why can't he talk in game if he talks in the loading screen. All in all, I can not recommend this game enough, it will keep you immersed for hours.

FYI: Do not waste your time with DLC, they are very hit or miss. I would just move on to Exodus in my opinion.

The Pros:
The gunplay is pretty good. The stealth is very enjoyable in this game, equip a silencer to your pistols and buckshooters, you can get really satisfying stealth gameplay outta this game. I highly recommend playing the game this way when facing human enemies. In addition, the redux edition runs really well and I only had one hard crash when tinkering with the settings.  Several on railed levels are great. The graphics at times still fairly well done by todays standards.

The Decent:
The story, its okay but nothing really good to shout about. The factions are very cliched, villians are one dimensional and nothing really diverts into more interesting side stories other than the main storyline. Gun customisation is also fairly decent. 

The Cons:
The pacing of the story, the game has a huge fetish of implementing fade to black to progress its story which is annoying as hell. The sound design for some weapons are aweful as well, for instance the reload sound of the ""AK-47"" sounds like a plastic toy. 

Conclusion:

Metro Last Light Redux is a decent story driven shooter, with several great segments presented in their levels. The stealth is a highlight of the game, as I really enjoy it very much. The pacing of the story could be better, constantly utilising fade to black to deliver their story and certain guns have some terrible  outdated sound designs.",1631999218,1631999717,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Metro Last Light is a sequel in the right track. The game still feels very amazing in 2021. The story, narration , and the atmosphere of this game are good or somewhat feel better than the original game Metro 2033.


Pro: Story, the lore, the world, the atmosphere
Cons: Still can get stuck/hard to move in some place, also I got annoying gameplay when the checkpoint bugged and pushed me to replay the chapter from the beginning.  Animation and model feel a little bit dated, but again redux version feel better now than the original version.  Oh also I really think the good ending is too hard to archive by first time player, and kinda well pushed too much into the ethic of the author / script writer but nevertheless I can say that I really enjoy the game.

There is a well known (and still not fixed) glitch where the takedown mechanic for both kill and knockout stop working entirely, so if you don't want to kill someone in your way you either have to find another way around them or figure out how to fix the glitch. Add this to the fact the game likes to crash 2 or 3 times with a not so forgiving automatic checkpoint system and the annoyance piles up quick.

Stealth was even more broken past the takedown glitch for me personally. It was more than common for my throwing knives to go through people without killing them and for my throwing knives to go through lights without breaking them but since I can't find a single fix for this online I can only assume this is an isolated or very new issue.

Overall I recommend the game but not on PC unless you are either willing to deal with stealth issues or plan to just shoot your way through the game.",1631587281,1631587281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, Last Light - being a sequel - had a lot to live up to.

Don't let my 2033 review fool you - I was really impressed by the stealth and I ADORED the story, characters and world building!

I expected top QUALITY shit, comrade! 

And did I GET that shit?

Ehh... yyyyyyes? 

I mean, I pick like a banjo player on an amphetamine binge - and I split hairs like a slicer in a rabbit factory :P but this game certainly contains PARTS that are better than 2033

For instance - the FINAL level - hot DAMN did I feel godly! Getting pushed farther and farther back - dying MULTIPLE times because I couldn't figure out what the fuck it was the game wanted me to do to stop that tank!

Yes, YES, game, I KNOW your tank is glowing red in some SPOTS, game - but sweet CHEEZITS - EVERYTHING is red right now!!!! Blood everywhere - fire - how was I supposed to SEE the glowing red bits from halfway across the FUCKING base?!?!?!

Ahem... 

The horror is still prevalent - as are the fucking spee-iders and jump scares - but they're paced a bit better and there's a lot more stealth levels this time. 

I think the game twigged on to the fact that it does stealth much better than it does run and gun FPS gameplay - which - I mean - come on - I have to change weapons or freeze time just to check how much ammo I have :P the UI is crap and not designed for anything BESIDES stealth. 

And the story? Oh my GOD the story - this - THIS - is why I'm glad I played these games before playing Exodus. The context of the last game made me so much more suspicious of certain characters and plots - and so much more invested. 

Plus, as I said in my other review, it's only 8 hours (ten or eleven if you're incompetent lol) and it fucking EARNS those hours just as much as this game's STORY does.

And the WORLD - oh - god - you could CHOKE on the fumes this game's world gives off! You could get fucking stoned on the radiant waft of the sweat this game's pits accumulated from building this world! Every corner - every niche - every cranny tells a story - a WORLD - and you just want to know it! You WANT to understand it! You want more!!!

Let me put it this way.

This game's story and world are SO engrossing that I want to stop the review RIGHT HERE... ... ... but, as I put on the cleats of punishment and prepare for some cruel kicks to the bollocks, gentle reader, brace yourself as I DON'T stop the review right here and get to the character's...

And, in some case, I mean FUCKING characters...

Let's start with the good - Khan - Miller - a new addition known as Pavel - and another certain 'newcommer' we'll call 'angel' for lack of a proper name :P - these character's are ALL deeply rounded and fascinating. Khan has lost so much - but he still looks at the world with BOUNDLESS curiosity and fascination. Miller is great and salty and amusing - as always - Pavel, the first stand out newcommer, is probably one of the most interesting character's I've encountered in a story-driven game like this. I know I'm SUPPOSED to end up hating him - but I came away liking him! And the REAL stand out - Khan's 'angel' - I really became attached to him over the course of his involvement with the story... ... ...

Alright, now, those of you who were paying attention, know I'm soothing the game's furrowed brow before I break out the fucking nail-covered spanking paddle and punish it for it's sins :P

Well, buckle up, and let's hope the game doesn't start getting off to it :P

I have two MAJOR character complaints (in addition to all the jump scares, spiders and a UI that looks like it was put together by a guy with his head in a paper sack) and they are named ANNA and LENITSKY.

We'll get the easy one first - Lenitsky is pointless. Not only does he steal the thunder of OTHER certain villains - but you won't even know who he is if you weren't paying attention when his name is mentioned during the first mission :P even worse, there are two times in the game where I wanted to absolutely WANTED to murder him - but I knew if I did - I'd be making a mistake. I didn't dare shoot him when I wasn't supposed to - or I'd get negative points AND I couldn't gut him like a fish for the same reason :P you built him up as this WORTHLESS piece of shit, game, I SHOULD be allowed to kill him!!!!

Now, on to the hard one.

Anna.

I HATED how she was handled.

This is probably my SJW showing or something - but they did her SO DIRTY in this game. You first meet her on your first mission - she's snotty - she's annoying - but has some amusing one liners so I was starting to warm to her... ... ... then the game fucking dumps her for the first half of the game!!!! I spent MORE TIME with PAVEL than I did with a woman the game ARBITRARILY decided was going to end up being my love interest! Even worse, at the half way point, when she shows back up, the game suddenly wakes up and realizes - SHIT!!!! WE'VE GIVEN THIS WOMAN, LIKE, NO CHARACTER!!!! QUICK!!! POINTLESS SEX SCENE!!!!

Because that's why I play games, folks, to put my knob in things :P You just can't understand a character if you haven't fucked it - right? 

Annoying, even AFTER the game seemed to realize that giving me a little side-boob and some pants-on-pants cuddling wasn't REALLY exposition or character-deepening gameplay; the game promptly seemed to FORGET that and dumped her AGAIN because she had a bruise on her shoulder!!! She's built up as this bad-ass sniper who's been hunting in the tunnels for almost two years and she get's taken out by a boo-boo?! 

The most hilarious 'Anna' moment was at the penultimate adventure where I'm about to go off to die and the game WRENCHES the control from me and shows me ANNA (who's been absent for the last three hours) on the debarkation terminal watching me leave!!! 

It's like the game was saying - this is your woman!!! YOU LOVE HER!!!!

The fuck are you talking about, Game? I wanna marry Pavel!!!! You actually gave HIM a personality... 

Or, at least you did, outside of the DLC missions...

God, those were embarrassing folks - amiright? Anna get's a five minute shooting gallery with virtually NO story - and Pavel, the standout from Last Light and my TRUE love, get's a series of closets where I stab some bitches and then get a cutscene with a fortune teller who wets herself... ... ... yet, somehow, out of ALL this, the last one I played, ended up blowing my mind.

Namely, the Khan mission - not only did it start with a character I did NOT expect - but it expanded on Khan's background and made me admire him in a way I hadn't expected! Plus, it had a giant radioactive monster BURNING a whole horde of rats :P what's not to like about that?

Shame they couldn't have put some of that time or budget into making my love interest something besides a pair of badly animated tits but - hey - I'm probably just being needlessly mean :P 

-sigh-

Don't let my incessant birdlike warbling turn you off this game - as you can see my thumb IS still resoundingly upwardly mobile. It's just - characters like Anna and Lenitsky (who are practically cardboard cutouts from the stock writers club) stick out so massively because the OTHER character's around them are so fascinating and deep - the story is so good - that they automatically DETRACT from any scene they're in. I have to pay credit, again, to the redux that was done with this game.

Gorgeously hideous doesn't do it justice - the textures, colors and lighting REALLY pops and even the soundwork seems much improved. The graphics LOOK almost as good as something you'd see nowadays and the world REALLY breathes.

Where 2033 was the originator that had notable flaws sprinkled throughout an original premise, and Exodus flirts with open world esq game play in a few hubs, Last Light seems to have taken on a middle path between the two in a few ways. While back before Exodus, Last Light seemed to be the more open exploration brother to the very linear first game, after the fact it has really highlighted what a balancing act Last Light was accomplishing. The story is tightly wound, the characters are fantastic, the world is wonderfully grim and simultaneously beautiful, and they continue the philosophical bent Artyom began in 2033 in new and emotionally intelligent ways as he goes on a kind of redemption quest.

Things I liked:

Story - Story was cool, liked how there were multiple endings.
World building - NPCs talked to each other from events in the last game, you learn a little more about some of the main characters from 2033 too.
Combat/Stealth - Aside from setpieces, it is entirely possible to play this entire game with stealth or, blast your way through the entire game

Graphics- Game is hella pretty, played through and didnt experience any bugs or glitches save dead enemy clipping into a surface once in a while. If you play on the harder difficulties with limited hud youll really get to take in the game. 

DLC - DLCs add a lot to the game, probably another 3-4 hours.

Things I didnt like:

Difficulty - The only thing separating difficulty is you have less health and there's less ammo, forcing you to do a stealth play through. There's no HUD on higher difficulties but you can still get all your inventory info by holding up the map screen. Enemy AI doesn't change. Further, you can run past most of the nonhuman enemies without sustaining damage, and enemies will eventually hit a wall where they cant follow you anymore.

Flinch - Your character has a fuckin seizure if you're hit, kind of annoying.",1630848603,1630848623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What it lacks over 2033 in pacing, it makes up for in sheer quantity of gameplay and overall tension throughout its campaign. The punishment for not being a thoughtful and careful player leaves you hanging by a thread and provides incredible relief when you wrap up Artyom’s story.

Despite this game being an overall improvement on 2033 in many ways, it does drag on slightly in certain segments near the end of the game, which does enforce the feeling of futility, but can also become exhausting if you play in long sessions. Like 2033, desperation becomes your default state of mind as you progress deep into this game. Slowly but surely, the game demands mastery over your skills, rather than dependence on your equipment. It will keep you on your toes.

At one point in this game, I experienced what I thought was a campaign-ending moment but was able to pull through it on Ranger Hardcore. At first, I found it frustrating. But I hope every player experiences the triumph that comes with beating impossible odds on an already impossibly difficult game experience like Last Light. The game does an excellent job of upping the ante and making you work for your victories, which are far more rewarding than even 2033s.

It has an expanded variety of locales over the first game and improved pacing, but its more complex plot can't quite rise above the very linear storytelling. Though there are lots of characters here, it's hard to care about any of them. As in the first game, there are two endings, but this time you will need to follow a guide to get the ""good"" one, because there are various things you need to do in your playthrough. That's kinda annoying for completionists.

Unfortunately, [I]Dark Light[/I] also inherits all the flaws of [I]2033[/I], as the gameplay and design are essentially the same. Once again, exploration is often punished, such as when you open a door and move to the next level even if you didn't want to. Tough luck, this is a one-way ride. Again, characters talk over each other and it's impossible to pay attention. And finally, voice acting continues to be horrendous, with the same bizarre decision that everyone use Russian-ish accents even though they speak English. Actually, here this poorly conceived principle is taken to truly absurd extremes (spoiler: [SPOILER]even the aliens have this cringey accent![/SPOILER]).

Apparently some gamers enjoyed the bits of gratuitous sex in the first game, because here it's just all over the place, in all its plasticky, uncanny-valley weirdness. Speaking of which, children are still freakishly rendered and voiced.

You see, 2033 was a horror game, assuming one has played on Ranger Hardcore for the full experience of Metro. But Last Light is a more action oriented game, consisting of a few very disturbing and chilling moments as opposed to Metro 2033. Despite that, the game rewards you for being magnanimus. Few action games do that, and that's what sets this apart.  

Narrative wise, it's fine. Plot is mostly generic but not bad. Writing is good.

Apart from the ending, there's too many random bugs, which will force you to reload a save, there are too many NPCs that will be the slowest walking NPCs I've ever seen and you'll spend a large part of the game waiting for them by the door, because you are literally 10 times faster than them and they're the only ones who can open those doors.

The story is fine, the gunplay is fun, the technical side is great including a flawless 32:9 support and constant 120FPS on 3080 ~4K, but the sour taste in my mouth at the end with some of the other issues is just not enough for me to recommend this game.

With the Redux versions, this is kind of lost to history, though an interesting bit of knowledge of the franchise.  

Metro: Last Light is much easier than Metro: 2033, even on Ranger Hardcore, the authentic Metro experience.  Bugs are limited or absent altogether in a playthrough, which is lovely.  

Characters, creatures, mini bosses and environments are all very well done in Last Light.  This is most apparent in the characters.  Characters are no longer introduced simply to die, they have more dialogue and the original voice work was definitely an improvement when Last Light first released.  

I've said it before and I cannot stress it enough.  Ranger Hardcore provides an incredible challenge and immersion that is unmatched in any other game of its genre.  (Yes, even you, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.)

I would not call Last Light a must-play like I would Metro: 2033, though I still recommend picking up the whole franchise and giving it at least one Ranger Hardcore attempt.",1629103175,1629103175,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game picks up a year after the events of the first game, assuming you got the bad ending that most players got, plunging missiles onto the mysterious alien looking dark ones. There's reports of a surviving dark one spotted, and you, Artyom, are ordered to make contact with it and kill it. This encounter ends with Artyom and the dark one being taken by Metro Nazis! So the wild ride begins. 

Last Light encourages stealth from the getgo, and the level design shows a lot more opportunities in being sneaky sneaky with lots of hidden passages to mouse around enemies. This takes away a lot of the blandness of the shooting mechanics as I found 2033 feeling a lot like a Call of Duty clone, damaging the immersion. This also gets around chewing through ammo which was pretty scarce in 2033 but here I believe it is a lot more plentiful even if you do go loud all the time.

There is a key mechanic that was never explained in 2033 and continues into Last Light. You get morality points from doing certain actions, like simply listening to an old farts story at a station or there negative ones like shooting someone in the face (these opportunities don't come up much for morality choices). These morality points are blindly banked and determine what ending you are going to get. This feels like a brute force method to get players to immerse themselves into the game.

Everything is told in first person, and everyone seems to warm to Artyom, even though he is silent. He speaks a brief monologue during the loading screens for each level, but I really don't understand why the team decided to keep him quiet during gameplay, as characters will speak to him and ask him things and even register that he is giving them the silent treatment. Yet everyone still seems to love Artyom. Many familiar faces of the first game return and some new, the best being the personable Pavel. You spend a lot of levels with him, he openly talks about his life and unlike the other characters, the actor really puts some bloody life into him. Which brings me onto the strange world of Metro. It is stuffed with bald men clad with military equipment. In the Metro stations I would say they are filled with 90% bald army men, 5% women, 5% children. It's very strange and takes away another level of immersion leaving a sausage festival environment. The game is also incredibly linear, which many have complained about. I feel the linear design only feels awful when you go through the metro stations. These moments you are told you have some time to wander, but there isn't really any wandering. You trigger NPC conversations as you walk through the station towards your exit to the next level, which all feels a bit flat.

But with all these little issues, I loved the game, it's a wild rollercoaster through the world of Metro. The time in the tunnels is greatly reduced, there is a lot more time on the surface (which looks awesome). I could only predict story points in the game, but I couldn't predict the levels around them. Escape a concentration camp, enjoy a cabaret show, trawl through a radioactive swamp whilst trying not to get eaten, drive a railcar! The first person perspective showing Artyom crawling through the vents, heaving the hatches open to the surface, these little touches immerse you into the environment of the ever changing levels.

In comparison to Metro 2033's Ranger Hardcore, it's been bumped up to something for sure.
The mutants are a pain to deal with now, since assault rifles don't deal good damage to them.
Revolvers work fine on them as long as you hit a headshot, but the shotguns are something completely
different. One shot up close is all it takes to put a mutant down.

I like how you have to use different weapons for different situations, but I don't like how you can't mix it up sometimes. Sure, you can shoot a mutant with  rifles and all but it won't be as effective as the shotguns unless you're using military grade ammo. In other words, being forced to use weapons to kill something more quicker doesn't feel nice, at least for me.

Other than that the game is nice, so is the story too.

   Metro Last Light was a worthy successor to the original Metro 2033. It is objectively a better video game than the original in almost every metric, however some of the changes from the original are in my opinion detrminetal to the unique experience that Metro 2033 brought to the table.

[b] Story [/b]
 
   Last Light follows the events from the previous game very closely. The events of 2033 create a foundation to which the story builds itself from. Similar to the previous game the story has two distinctive endings based on the player's choices and actions, however different from the previous game, some of the choices you make are more subtle, and a unaware player might even miss them in the heat of the moment. While others are far more explicit. All of this is good, it feels natural, and not gamey.

 There is however on aspect of the story that definitely feels off. And that is some of the characters. While some characters are very well fleshed out, others that appear to have quite an impact in the story for the protagonist are completely neglected. One of them is no doubt Anna. Her development through the story is missing so much context that makes the player be confused about the status of her relationship with Artyom. The developers simply didn't spend enough time developing her character for this game and it shows. In Metro Exodus she's a much better character, but here, she's just worthless.

[b] Gameplay [/b]

   Metro Last Light uses a very similar gameplay style to that of the original,  a Heavily scripted story Driven First Person shooter horror game. It is very linear, but you have plenty of room to explore for ammo and filters, as well as room to be exposed to the nightmare that surrounds the city, as well as the entire Metro of Moscow. 
  Last Light was the game that introduced its stealth system to the franchise, the same stealth mechanics that are still present in Exodus. I don't like that stealth system, because in my opinion it reduces the challenge of the game significantly, but that is very subjective. What i'll say is that the system is very functional, however a player needs to be careful about relying on it too much, Last Light will ocasionally force the player into combat situations, and if you are been relying on the stealth too much to the point where you don't have a weapon that can do long range and short range engagement with humans, you will struggle a lot. Overall the gameplay of Metro Last Light is a lot of fun, it can be quite challenging and exciting so that's good in my books.

[b] Graphics [/b]

  Metro Last Light continues its predecessor excellent attention to details. The game looks stunning even to this day, It looks great, the character models, the texture quality, i really can't complain about it, the game looks great.

[b] Performance [/b]

To deal with the great graphics of the game, Last Light also offers excellent performance. The game runs great, a lot better than the original Metro 2033 did, it is very well optmized. I have a pretty good pc this days, but even when i had a more budget computer with a budget graphics card, i was still able to play this game fairly well, and the game still looked good while doing it.

[b] bugs [/b]

  In the Redux version of Last Light i didn't encounter many bugs, most of the issues i encountered were relatively minor graphical glitches. i did encounter a bigger graphical glitch at one point but the fix was just repairing the game so i can't complain about that. So when it comes to bugs, i can't complain the game is very well polished in that regard.

[b] Conclusion [/b]

  Metro Last Light was a great game to continue this fantastic franchise, and though in my opinion the original game was better in a lot of ways, Metro Last Light continues to be a great game and definitely a must have for anybody that enjoyed the first game, as well anybody that was introduced to this franchise by the latest Metro Exodus.",1627267433,1627267433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Feels more like Call of Duty in a lot of instances than Metro. Also totally annoying boss fights have been added. Story is also weak. There is so much potential in the Metro Universe but it was f...ed up with Last Light. Srry can't recommend the game to anyone. Finishing this game is more like a torment than having fun playing a videogame. Also way too many cutscenes. Am I playing a game or watching a movie with some button clicking every once in a while ?! Worst thing about the game however is the huge amount of bullet sponge enemy beasts and juggernaut humans. Yeah right keep building up atmosphere with the setting and then ruin it by making the fights like in The Divsion !? What is it in gaming in the last decade that every game needs those stupid bullet sponge enemies ???,1626695156,1626695480,False,3,0,0.503787875175476074,0,True,False,False

In this one, you are hot on the heels of the last remaining Dark One, following the canon ending of the previous game in which you launched the missiles at the Dark Ones' home. As usual, you will be accompanied by several characters and fight bandits, commies, Nazis, miscellaneous mutants etc. Truth be told, despite a variety of improvements (to weapon handling, more weapons, some more variety in enemies) it's basically the same game, and that's not a bad thing if you enjoyed the first one.

The DLCs allow you to explore a variety of missions - you can let loose against a flood of Reds as a Nazi heavy weapons trooper, stealthily infiltrate a Nazi base as a Red sniper, and play missions revealing more of the characters you played alongside in the main campaign (Anna, Pavel, Khan and Uhlman). My favourite mission is one where you play a Polis stalker exploring the Great Library from Metro 2033. You start out with limited supplies and have to scavenge for money and artifacts on the surface in order to get better gear to explore further in the library. Not all the DLCs hit the mark (in particular, the Developer and Tower missions feel a little flat) but there's plenty here to complement the base game.

As with the prequel, I recommend this. You'll have to make a second playthrough like the first in order to get all the achievements, but thankfully the game goes by pretty quick if you know where to go and what to do. Some cutscenes are even skippable! Definitely try this out.",1626572329,1626572329,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The story hooks you in for one wild ride, providing plenty of apocalyptic and paranormal intrique, with just the right amount of horror.

What I don't like about it? There is no real variety of gear and creatures. There seems to be only 10 weapons, with even fewer available ways to modify. weapons. While the devs have done a fantastic job at at creating such an apocalyptic world, they put more work into the NPC crowds you cant really interact with at each station you encounter, then they do with the ones you do. 

The Mutant Watchmen (the rodent/dog like ones) are overall the same, with the same soundset applied to each one. They are all the same color and size. What I think they could have done better is make them various in size, the bigger they are the slower they are and the harder they are to kill, but also the less places they'll be able to follow you into. Sound could have been done where size determined their tonal range, and provide a more variety of sound sets, which set is played could depend on their state (like whether they have targetted a player or standing idle). The same ruleset could be applied to all the creatures.

There should have been at least some kind of skill system, perhaps a simpler version of Fallout style skills. Being that in Last Light, you start out already a Ranger, the skill set you have would be something equivalent to what it would have looked like when a player has reached the ending of Metro 2033.

To a limited extent, weapons should have been moddable while outside stations, like being able to install/remove scopes and muzzle devices from both equipped weapons and guns laying on the ground. I know this is addressed in Metro Exodus, but I only mention this to highlight something I see as a negative to the overall gameplay experience.",1626477727,1626477727,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The problem is ammo, basically. You can take care of your ammo all you want but there are sections of the game with boss fights and where you have to fight waves of enemies that are basically next to each other, and it's almost impossible not to waste bullets and eventually run of of ammo.

Using grenades and knives can help but playing on PC, the controls for switching from one to the other are very unresponsive and enemies attack hard and fast, so you'll get hit a lot, and use your medkits very quickly.

Worst yet, there are certain kinds of weapons that you rarely find, like handguns for example, meaning you might have handgun ammo but not find a single one in hours! So, you'll sell your handgun bullets to buy other kinds of bullets for a very low exchange rate.

One improvement I really like is that stealth can now be toggled and there are now proper stealth levels, though it's not perfect, some areas were really frustrating,

Story-wise it's good, it picks up right after the ending of the previous one. I was confused with happened in the events of the first game but the whole plot makes sense now after playing this.

Like in 2033, I really like all the characters but it felt like the interactions with your companions have dropped down in the second half. Still, all the side characters are great and they are the ones that makes the bleak world of Metro alive.

I didn't get the good/canon ending and the game itself is not something I would want to replay but still, it's good. I would recommend anyone to play this at least once.

Play 2033/2033 redux First. You won't regret it. It fleshes out the story and makes certain moments hit harder.

Metro Last Light is an unforgiving game on harder difficulties. ESPECIALLY on survival mode. It rewards patience and awareness of your surroundings and other npcs. Not every beast and soldier must die and certain characters will acknowledge this.

Play 2033 then Last light if you crave a challenge and/or thought provoking story

I had it originally as a thumbs down and I'll leave it as that even though I'll recommend it.

The reason I had it as a thumbs down initially is there's a few very annoying issues with the game but over all it's worth playing.  

[h1]pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] Enjoyable story
[*] Nice art direction
[*] Decent graphics
[*] Decent voice acting
[*] Game play is pretty fun
[/list]

[h1]cons[/h1]
[list]
[*] Facial graphics weren't very good. Mostly you don't notice it but some times it's really jarring.  Like a romantic scene looked just goofy because of the facial animation/graphics.
[*] Voice acting isn't consistent.  Artyom is great and a few of the others are too. But some of the other voice actors you can hear them slip in and out of the Russian accent.
[*] Confusing maps.  Some of the areas are confusing and it's hard to determine where you're supposed to go.  This isn't normally an issue (""oh no! you had to wander longer!"") but this does matter when you have a limited time you're allowed to explore or you die (bad air requires filters, these confusing areas are in areas where there's bad air so you'll go through filters fast).  If you don't get lost or confused on where to go, this is not an issue.  I only had this issue on three areas and it only was a huge problem once.  But this combined with the next problem is what caused me to almost quit playing this game.
[*] Save spots don't care how much ammo or filters you have.  So what happened to me which made me almost quit the game was I had two maps in a row where I wasn't sure where to go and used all my filters and had only like 20 seconds left of air and it saved right before a mini boss battle.  Welp, it was impossible no matter how many times I played it since the boss would take a couple of minutes at least to kill when I had 20 seconds.  Only solution I could find online since others had this same problem: Restart the chapter. I was about to quit the game because I didn't want to play a lot of it over, but I discovered the chapter start was less than 5 minutes behind where I was anyways so I played it again.  But it still annoyed the heck outta me.  The game should've really had a minimum of ammo and filters you can have when it loads up a save point.  So if you're at a save point and you have 30 seconds left, it should default you to like 3-4 minutes of air.  If you have 0 ammo, it should default to some.
[*] Other confusing parts.  Near the end you're told to stop a tank but you're not sure exactly how you're gonna fight a tank with normal bullets from far away.  You shoot at the place where you THINK you're supposed to but nothing happens.  I did this many times and it just doesn't work so I finally looked it up.  Turns out you don't shoot there, you shoot elsewhere, somewhere where it isn't that obvious.  But as a hint, if you're stuck, look all around the tank and see if any part is colored slightly different and shoot that part, and then the other parts that become that color.  It would've helped if one of the other guys mentioned what to do instead of ""stop the tank"" where shooting at 95% of the tank does nothing.
[*] How to get the ""good"" ending.  Well, I found this out very late, the good ending depends on ""moral points"".  You can get a lot of ""moral points"" from 2 major decisions in the game and from another action you can take on your own.  But doing just those isn't enough.  You have to get plenty others which is annoying because moral points can be things like ""knock out those guys"", ""avoid battle with those guys"", ""find secret location here"", ""listen to that dialogue all the way thru"".  If you want to, it's basically be as ""good guy"" as you can, search all areas, listen to all dialogues.

I'm playing on Hardcore - and have done so before, when this game was previously available on the Discord Store. Completed it there, bought it here to play through again. 

This time however it seems the game really didn't want me to complete  it; a few chapters in (Bandits) the entire prompt system for knocking out / killing an enemy just stopped working. So the entire moral point system for being stealthy just gets thrown out the window, because the only thing I can do is shoot from here on. I tried messing with save files, I tried restarting from previous chapters (Revolution, Regina) but it always seems to break. I daren't try replaying the entire game just for it to break again. Point is; if there's a fix you can search for online, I've tried it.

Furthermore, it seems to not only be an issue with Last Light Redux, but also 2033 Redux, and even Exodus! I'm not really sure whats going on behind the scenes, but I doubt it will ever get fixed. I'm permanently locked out of the good ending here.

The dark, haunting story matched the frightening gameplay, and the killer music still leaves me ringing. Metro: Last Light is a worthy sequel in that regard. About 12 hours of play continues the same deep story, with similar game mechanics and an eerie soundtrack. Play it for the story and you will not be disappointed.

But play it for the gameplay... I have a few minor complaints. In order to continue the perhaps overly complicated storyline, Last Light featured several cinematic sections where you walk and talk for exposition. Obligatory cinematics make a game feel like a movie, stealing time from gameplay itself.

I also fought more humans than monsters. That may have been a commentary on how we humans, the species who destroyed the world in a nuclear war, are the real monsters. Fighting humans also gave the stealth levels more emphasis, which I unfortunately found tedious.

And I did not find the bonus levels very fun, so I didn't bother finishing them.

Again, these are not major complaints. I still wandered Metro and the wasteland with my trusty shotgun, shooting everything in sight. [spoiler]That method will get you the ""bad"" ending, but hey, I never said I was a hero.[/spoiler] And I had 1.5 heart attacks from jumpscares, so Last Light gave me what I wanted, for the most part.

I did experience some bugs at random times. The game would minimize itself at startup and refuse to focus, only after letting it run in the background for a good few minutes would it focus and stay focused. I only actually had the game crash once and never experienced any bugs in gameplay.

As for the actual game itself, it's phenomenal! The story telling is great, the game is neatly balanced between being a linear storyteller and a semi-open world allowing you to veer off into some arbitrary room to loot or have some enriching experience [spoiler](like a flashback into the past, looking at the bombs falling through an apartment window)[/spoiler]. You feel connected to the characters, especially in a time like this (for the really late ones, this review was written during the COVID-19 pandemic) the feeling of being isolated to a safehaven (IRL the safety of your own home, in-game the underground) is actually enhancing to the experience.

In most similarly styled games (TLoU, Resident Evil, Chernobylite), the mobs i.e. zombies or indeed mutants are ""just there"". They don't really have any reason for existing, they just do for the sake of having something to kill. In Metro this feeling was not there for me at all. It feels very imminent, everytime you step outside the sense of immediate danger always hits back just as hard if not harder. The world isn't ""ours"" anymore, we do not own the surface and the Earth has turned on us..

PROs:
- Amazing storytelling
- Linear / semi-open world allowing for minor exploration
- Compelling environment
- No ""be the hero"" characters, just survival

CONs:
- Sometimes minimizes itself at launch, will work after running in the background for a few minutes
- NPCs during ""follow him/her"" objectives are [i]so god damn slow[/i]

I picked up the trilogy on sale a while back and recently loaded up the first game Metro 2033... I got hooked and played the whole thing, including getting 100% achievements in about a week and immediately moved on to the second installment, Metro Last Light.

Everything I loved about the Metro 2033 Redux has been improved upon, expanded upon, and made tighter and sharper in Metro Last Light Redux. The light stealth elements become more important and more fun. The weapons and weapon customization is more robust and the addition of new weapons like sniper rifles gives you more choices in how you want to play. 

The story is deeper, more sinister, and more engaging. The maps are larger, more varied, and more exciting (albeit still a little too linear in some aspects). 

I have blazed through the game and after roughly 30 hours I have gotten all of the main story achievements and am moving on to the DLCs next.

Unlike 2033, this redux is just a slight texture update, so you don't have to choose between atmosphere and gameplay like with the 2033 redux.

- Story is a bit better (more complex) then in 2033, but still the main focus is on the life in metro stations and its people. Khan character is somewhat weak written and demistified. He still knows the metro's misteries and lore, but I couldn't get through the fact that he knows that the Dark ones are good, even calls them angels. While he never says how does he know. Which is kinda distracting. I am not a big fan of the design change from the original 2033, but at least the characters are distinguishable. Oh and yes, Arťom gets a girlfriend in this one and while everyone has a problem with her changing from hostile to lover character too quickly, I am not even sure I understand why is she hostile towards the main guy in the first place. But those are the biggest minuses of the game.

- Gameplay didn't change, but it was improved and polished. Some new weapons were added. There are more levels above the ground this time, but the great level DLCs bring you back to the dark, claustrophobic tunnels you haven't visited before. What I had a problem with regarding gameplay, is how the good/bad endings are determined. Basically you will only get the good ending if you let every ars*hole live. Which feels really forced.

Really liked the story & the game play mechanics are very satisfying. Especially if you find yourself frustrated with how forgiving a lot of shooters are these days. I found this to be a perfect balance where there is a lot of challenge to be had & you need to manage your resources well on most difficulty settings but it isn't just a frustrating grind. When you get something done in this game there is for sure a sense of satisfaction that is lacking in a lot of the big titles.

Most of all though I was surprised at how much this game made me think towards the end. Without spoiling anything some choices come up that I did not realize we're choices and they made me reflect on human nature & gut reactions based on our preconceived notions for a good minute. I got the impression that was intentional and I really love that in a game. I think when a game can make you feel & reflect on something like that with relatively indirect story telling that elevates it to the level of an artform. Playing this I felt uneasy, fear, accomplishment, sad at times, & even a little disappointed in my choices. Pretty much everything I would be looking for from a survival shooter with horror elements.

[h1] The Good [/h1]
+ The remaster really had me taking a lot of screenshots because of some scenes (Did not look like an old game at all!)
+ Action-pack scenarios (shooting radioactive wildlife on sec and then riding on trains the next!)
+ Gameplay option based on preference (spartan for more action and survival for more resource management)
+ Each town/hub location is memorable - the townspeople have their own stories which you can hear when you pass by
+ Plenty of weapon selections

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
- I didn't really like the Dark ones story. I think Metro is strongest when it focuses on the more human aspects of the story rather than the fictional.
- Weapon customization is limited
- Night vision goggles made me dizzy at times

One of the games that rewards exploration the most. I am a sucker for Lore and story, and this game oozes with soul, if you take your time, and let your curiosity and senses lead you away from the path forward. Listen to the Metro's inhabitants stories and scavenge your surroundings. More often than not, you're rewarded for it.

Top notch gun-play and stealth mechanics as well. It's a lot of fun to be Batman, thinning out a group of opponents, without them ever seeing you.

 Despite being almost 7 years old the overall look of the game still holds up really well. 

Cons: *rant* The controls are pretty terrible. They are very 'tanky' and the player moves excruciatingly slow on almost all fronts. It takes forever to throw a knife, reload your weapon, throw a grenade, melee, etc. I think the delay is there by design so you have to plan ahead before you do anything (kind of like Dark Souls 3), but it just feels poorly executed. Quite often you will find yourself getting swarmed by fast moving enemies and there is a NOTICEABLE LACK OF URGENCY in the main character's movements that will make you want to throw your keyboard across the room.  

Also, there is a lot of debris in the post-apocalyptic world and poorly placed collision geometry to go along with it.

With my complete experience, I'm about to share my thoughts about Metro Last Light, which is followed by novel from Dimitry Glukhovsky. In my opinion, Metro Last Light is merely a successful contender that continues the story with the same tension, immersion just as Metro 2033 did. Now let me talk about it much more openly.

[i]10.0/10.0, Entirely exhilarating continuation of the story with more fiercest survival experience[/i]

[h1]Story[/h1]
First of all, Metro Last Light continues the further story where Metro 2033 dropped off. Through the story, you have to survive a widespread complicated journey for making amends which makes the main character and his fierce story more ambitious and sharp. Also all the characters are well developed and will be growing in you. Besides, there are lots of unexpected complications to immense the lore of the story. So this is how the story continues and embarks. After all this, there's always a message for us through it.

[h1]Gameplay and more[/h1]
This is almost same as their last wing, Metro 2033. Like FPS genre with challenging combat, insecure situations and subduing atmospheres. But for challenging combat, you've got capable weapons like Shambler, Kalash and much more. Also you'll have lots of equipment for strategical approach. But if you aren't into conflicts then you're welcome to stealth approach most of the times. Like you can complete most parts without even killing anyone which takes unimaginable patience and tactics. 

About collectibles and more, there are tons of collectibles around you. Like ammunition, equipment, additional things. In that post-apocalyptic world, Collectibles won't be your choice, that would be essential for you. But your difficulty mode matters strictly here.

[h1]Visuals and more[/h1]
Visuals, this actually apprehends initial preface for immersive atmospheres. Visuals are definitely beautiful even more after Redux. Surely, Redux's been more improved and detailed for better experience. Even facial expressions and textures has been reworked. So i have nothing to yammer about visuals.

[h1]Soundtracks[/h1]
For creating the immersion, we need atmospheric and intensive background scores and i'm pretty aware that Metro Last Light has it. Composers affiliated every situations with perfect soundtracks. All those soundtracks would lift your survival experience into another level.

[h1]Impressions[/h1]
Metro Last Light has absolute enormous storyline with extreme plots which might pop up your jaw. For fierce experience, this has very complex gameplay and subduing atmospheres. Also, your journey will be very comprehensive because there are tons of chapters for you.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]
Obviously, I'm completely recommending it. I'd suggest you to start from Metro 2033 and then this one which is the chronological order. Back in 2015, I completed it for first time and I didn't even know that it wasn't the first, It's actually a sequel.",1620747595,1620791208,True,8,0,0.596510350704193115,0,True,False,False

A simple way to sum up this game is atmospheric, apocalyptic Russia with an epic story and gameplay that is good, but not Call of Duty's gunplay. It is more clunky and it makes you feel like a survivor in Moscow, not a tough Soldier.

I don't like how the story tried to make us sympathize with the Dark Ones. In the first game, they openly kill other humans and they directly threaten Artyom (which gives us the iconic line, 'If it's hostile, kill it') and the first time we see them in this game, it's a shot of them tricking a crew of humans into killing each other. Not exactly the best way to portray them if you wanted the player to like them.

Also, I'm confused about Khan and Anna. Khan was this magic mystery guy that shows up just when you need him, and we get no other information on him ever, and barely even get to learn anything about him. Where did he come from? Why can he do all these things? Originally, I thought he was a Dark One himself, but nope. I wish we could have got more out of him, but nope. This is one of the characters where the mystery isn't enough to satisfy me. 

Also, Anna gets sidelined really early on, which sucks. She's supposed to be this badass sniper, but she can't take out a crew of Reich guys and it gets the player captured. Then we see her later on, for two minutes before she gets captured, and then she ends up fucking Artyom after another two minutes of them talking, and then she dips out, and doesn't even show up to fight at D6, when her skills could have been very useful. It just feels like she could have been so much more, but she shows up, has his kid, and game ends. I probably wouldn't even be mad about this romance if we had seen more scenes of her and Artyom bonding. 

Overall, great weapons, great combat, stealth is oriented in a way that rewards varied gameplay, but the story is a bit lacking. 6/10.",1620683191,1620683191,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

There are a few changes to how the game presents itself that aren't bad, but they are different, and they bear mentioning. Last Light is more bombastic and action focused, while 2033 was slower outside a few exceptions. 2033 very rarely required you to fight human enemies toe to toe (allowing stealthy ways around) Last Light will make you fight more often, which could be a problem for some people. Overall it wasn't too bad for myself, because I often use a mixture of stealth and combat, but there were one or two situations that it definitely put me in a bind (once on a moving train and another in the red square, fair warning, if you're playing on ranger hardcore, which I still recommend you do, keep your head down and play smart in those parts) That said, there are also some more exploration based sections that I find to be significantly more compelling than things in 2033, Overall, there's a little more in both directions, and both are good. 

Similar to this, the story has become both more juvenile and more mature. With it pushing big bouncing russian boobies in your face on a few occasions (including a mandatory not-quite sex scene), but on the other hand having a pretty mature plot about war in the post apocalypse, and seeking forgiveness from people you've wronged, trying to do the right thing, ETC. If you can ignore the stupid parts, the rest of it is very compelling, and a definite step up from the ""stop the dark ones"" plot in 2033.

I enjoyed Last Light a lot, and, if I had to think about it, I'd probably replay it over 2033, although they're very close. Last Light has a few changes some people might be less tolerant of than others, but overall I still think it's a good experience, and I look forward to playing Metro Exodus when the Enhanced edition comes out in a few days, Strong Recommend to fans of 2033.",1620111969,1620111969,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of those titles that proves videogames as an artform.
The plot is amazing, the side conversations add depth to the surroundings, and all the little details in each station tell a different story of what life would be like there. It's also always fun to find hidden content.

This is a story of damnation and redemption.
Its an epic of the most radiant good, and the darkest evil.
The entire metro is anxious, all whisper of uncertain rumors surrounding the contents of the doomsday bunker D6.
The only thing that is certain, is war.

In this installment, [spoiler]it is made canon that artyom condemns the entire race of dark ones to nuclear extermination;
except one. 
Will artyom finish what he started? Or will he earn his, and all humanities, forgiveness? [/spoiler]

The DLC is well worth the price, major huge dank chron props to the developers (WHO CLEARLY WERE FIRED AND DID NOT GET TO MAKE EXODUS ), for maintaining a careful, often downright impossible, balance between two political extremes. Also without excessively painting one as worse than the other.

You can defend the proud and glorious reich in the Front Line DLC, mowing down hordes of communists (rare these days)
You can also infiltrate the reich as the sneaky, subversive reds (not so rare) in the Sniper Team DLC. Featuring the VSK sniper rifle.
Theres a spartan training mission, where you collect supplies and resources for the underground, it gets progressively difficult.
They even have a mission for pavel and anna too!
Consider this where metro left off, they havent actually made a metro game after this. Some people say they did, but those peoples standards are low, and they let bad games get published because they'll buy it. 
Look at star wars. It sucks because people bought in to the mediocrity.

The game definitely gave me the urge to read the Novels myself now and to dive even deeper into the lore and world of the Metro Universe.
Once again you slip into the shoes of Artyom, who became a full Ranger after fulfilling his mission successfully at the end of Metro 2033. Last Light takes part after the 2033 ending in which the Dark Ones were eradicated by a Missile Strike. 
      
Or were they? What starts as an easy mission to confirm a sighting of a last Dark One, turns into a mission to prevent the Metro from a grim dark fate which could ultimately lead to the death of every last remaining human. 
Your journey leads you through vast tunnel systems, friendly and hostile stations and long forgotten claustrophobic passage ways. And of course, there a lot and lots of spiders!
As a difference to Metro 2033, a large part of Last Light takes place above ground, you will see a lot of the Ruins of Moscow and what happened to the city after the bombs fell. 
4A Games did a fantastic job again with the level building the style of the environments you pass through and the atmosphere of the game. You really get a good feeling for the game world and the characters and their goals and feelings. 
4A nailed the “this feels so real” feeling once more in my opinion.
   
Beside the fantastic main game, the Redux version of Metro: Last Light contains 9 dlc levels, which are the following.:
->Heavy Squad: It was okay, more or less a 10 Minute shooting gallery with annoying boss fight. 
 ->Sniper Team: An enjoyable stealth experience in which you infiltrate an enemy base as a Sniper.  (Surprise!)
->Kshatriya: Quite a lot to this one. You are a scavenger and progress through the level and unlock new Guns/Areas on your way. 
->Spider Lair: Spiders, Spiders and even more Spiders. Did I mention mutated Spiders?
->The Tower: Very Hard Wave Mode DLC with a wide variety of weapons to choose from.
->Pavel: As Pavel you have to escape a Reich base after getting captured. Either stealth your way through or go in all guns blazing. 
->Khan: Quick journey into Kahn’s past and one of his key experiences from his perspective.
->Anna: The first mission of the Game from Anna’s point of view
->Developer level: To play and toy around with 

Like Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light is a great, atmospheric shooter experience you don’t want to miss out on. 
Like 2033 though, Last Light is once again not a game for people with Arachnophobia, Spiders are everywhere and you often also have to deal with gross mutations of them.",1619134081,1619170109,True,32,0,0.798248887062072754,0,True,False,False

This ""good"" is not always achievable, but the hope that guides the protagonist is captivating and intriguing. This statement is also true for Metro: Last Light - from the very first moments, the sequel begins to take the soul. After a difficult introductory video, which can be safely attributed to one of the most impressive moments of the game, you begin to fully understand how imaginary human superiority is and how quickly a personality can degrade. One press of the button - and the whole planet plunged into chaos, and humanity was on the verge of extinction. Sincere emotions evoked by the unique atmosphere are the most amazing thing in the game. The world, twisted by a nuclear catastrophe, still makes an impression, and the excellent musical accompaniment only enhances it. The environment looks extremely dignified: solid graphics, well-built lighting, competent design solutions, as well as serious attention to detail - all this contributes to a deeper immersion in the world of the game you want to believe in. In addition, the developers have brought to mind the stealth, polished the gameplay, tightened the animation, improved the impact and added customization of the weapon (compared to the original in 2010). Metro: Last Light masterfully combines bouncy linear stretches with the ability to explore dungeons and surfaces, spectacular staged runs coexist with the relative freedom of large levels. At the same time, the player is not forced to stealth or a power approach, instead offering to combine them in the desired proportions. The local history has transformed from a depressing parable into a kind of action adventure, the plot develops very dynamically and, one might say, there is a certain epic character. As a result, despite the shortcomings of artificial intelligence and flaws of a technical nature, the positive aspects seem to be more numerous and significant, which makes it possible to put the game 9/10 - the continuation managed to do the main thing - to improve the original in all respects and at the same time not to lose everything that it was for. so loved by the players.

Story is interesting enough for you to ask for more, and graphics on the other hand... My, my, my, my, my, my, my. I've never expected a game that came out in 2014 to be this beautiful! The environment is extremely rich and immersive, underground metros are depicted as warm and comforting and a little bit of dirt on top of it; politics, corruption, poverty and such... And surface being a cold, dead wasteland that you never want to step in unless you absolutely have to... Enough to send shivers down your spine! I was already in love with Metro Franchise's soundtrack, so i won't make a comment about that.

Played on the hardest difficulty on both games (Survival and hardcore I think it is) and feelt that Metro 2033 gave an fair experience. You can kill allmost any enemy (human) with 1-2 bullets but they can also easily kill you. But in this game I feelt that the enemy allways outnumbered me, made me empty my magasines, broke my gasmask etc.
Plus the stealth mechanics are weird, enemies could walk into me without spotting me in the dark, but they can see a dead corpse behind a dumspter miles away.  

I aslo tried going towards the good ending in this game, I saved prisoners, donated money to beggars, gave away a teddy bear, spared SEVERAL surrendering enemies, saved innocents from getting killed and raped by bandits, did not attack hungry and vile beasts if they would not attack first, listened and eavesdroped on a ton of conversations, and even though a huge fucking bear tried to kill me I saved its life afterwards. 
Even though I did do all of these things I got the bad ending. I set up myself for a worse playing experience to receive a special outcome from this game, and didnt even receive it. 
If you cant have fun while playing a game and get a good ending at the same time, its not your fault its the developers fault. The witcher 3 for example gave me a great playing experience and story meanwhile also rewarded me a the best ending. 

Some games allways label the players Good or Bad depending on how they play the game, the more fun the experience is, the more evil you are, the more boring and lame experience you have the better you are as a person (Metro games and Dishonored Games example). Dishonored the game were you play as an assassin, welp if you actually assassinate people you get a worse fucking ending... frick you for trying to have fun!

The story was mediocre at best, random love interest out of nowhere (probably cause the game only hade one woman character), had only two likeable charachters, the bad guys motives was bassically ""Im the bad guy"" and ""coomunism"". The first game was based on the book meanwhile this game is not I think, can hence explain why the story is lacking. 

The graphics are good for its age, and it brings out the dark and horror feelings from the Metro in a good way, I have only read one Metro book and I feel like the games translate the written words into code quite well. This game has some big flaws, like story, difficulty and the choice of the ending the game gives you, but besides that if you do not try to go after a true Metro survival experience as I did, it will act as as normal, fun stealth action game. 

If you wanna play Metro any of the Metro games, I would recommend Metro Exodus or Metro 2033. 

This was my experience of the game, most people like Metro Last Light and they probaly do that for good reasons, if you buy this game I hope your experience will be better than mine :)",1617360216,1617360216,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are excellent and the environments are detailed and fun to explore. The people you meet are interesting with meaningful backgrounds and great voice acting. Combat is enjoyable and fluid with a good amount of different weapons. 

I am really happy with all the small little details they added to the gameplay, like wiping you gasmask, changing the air filter when you hear heavier breathing, or charging your pneumatic weapons.

But if you like nice story, post-apocalyptic world to explore, tactical combat with some planning, like to craft a bit and having few decisions then you will hardly find better games. For me Metro games are one of the best FPS games that were ever created. I just finished playing all 3 games twice in a row. It was a bliss. The deepness of the experience I felt was awesome. First of all as you most probably know this is based on a book and you will feel it. The graphics in Metro games really capture the spirit of aged metro stations and fallout in the wind of wasteland of Moscow, but don’t forget masterfully presented citizens both alive and dead plus local fauna and flora. And it’s not so greenish as new Fallouts. Audio is great too, radios, folk music, subway performers, sounds, cries. Weapons are simply great. Divers, versatile, upgradeable, close combat, medium range, long range, pick one. Stealth or carnage are both possible. Tikhar is maybe one of the best friends a sniper can hope for. Steal balls as ammo, high pressure to spit it out – I’m in – only down side you have to headshot. Yeah baby, pump it up!!! I like the style of difficulties as they are presented. Survival or Spartan and after further branching. I missed it in third game. The game boost also Ranger HC mode for the real immersion removing HUD and all sort of help/hints, improving dmg of you and everyone and making found resources even scarce. Metro games are highly immersive so adrenalin junkies blow your socks off. But fair to mention that even on harder difficulties it’s still easy for any experienced FPS player. Resources are abundant if you loot everything you can find ;) 
Each enemy has its own style of fighting and strengths/weaknesses and has a nice place in the game. As you travel you will encounter various factions of metro, communists, nazis, traders, rogues, bandits, citizens, Spartans. You will be accompanied thru most of the game by an NPC and they will add to the atmosphere as the persons have something meaningful to say, inform you about some metro facts, history, give you advice on the progress. It makes the world feel more alive. AI is really good. The difficulties make a big difference in all the fields. While it is very hard to make some levels stealthy on hard diff, it is quite easier on normal. To stealthy kill or even stun everyone on hard is doable, much harder to go without even stun. Enemies will react on each situation more sensitively. 
There is only one thing that I hate. Scripts. In some places the script is simply not believable. Like in some situations all enemies know exactly where you are and are able to sharpshoot with weapons that do not have such precision. You are shooting from behind two covers, so thru two holes and still bullets fly insanely close. Things like this destroy the immersion and reality. And frustration starts to build. Also not to be able to save in certain points makes up for recalling console strategy – which shouldn’t go un-criticized by people. This is a PC, it can handle save and the structure of the game allows for it. I understand if you couldn’t save in some places, like bosses and such. 
For me the atmosphere of the game is the best thing here, but if other parts would be mediocre I would be sad, which is not the case, so let me focus on that. Atmosphere is increased ten folds with presence of characters – no joke. First you have kind of a reminder about events from last Metro, stroll thru Spartan base and the people do not give you the credit you deserve based on your performance until now, you meet majority of characters: Khan, Ulman, Miller in a briefing room plus some new like Anna and you set of to explore this beautiful treat of a game *SPOILER ALERT start* Anna will become your future wife and Miller you father in law and it will turn up just great in 3rd game, only too bad Ulman and Khan are not there *SPOILER ALERT end* Again there is Pavel, but this time a commie Pavel. Lovable character really. The plot of the second game is even better then the first. You can even visit the brain behind proletariat. Try to find him when on Red Square. I still wonder who is maintaining all the wooden contraptions in few level, but I like the design. Some levels in this game are like playgarden for destruction. The things you can do and the weapons you can use. Possibility for moral choices is here as well. Two possible ends. This time the good end is the codex ending. To obtain good end you simply have to explore the world, be curios, listen to people worries and care about the world. 
Then there are DLC and I love them all. I bought the game as a bundle, so not sure how it worked before but when you can have it for few Euro then go for it. Each story is worth at least 2 E in my book. For example Kshatriya or Spider Lair or Khan or Sniper or Pavel are such great levels. Only Two towers is out of the bag of treats as a spinach or similar. It is simply not with the spirit of Metro game. Enjoy one of the few gems in the FPS mountain.

I liked this game more than the prequel, it wasn't so punishing and more pleasant to play. I didn't need to take a short break after every mission. Or maybe it's thanks to experience I gained from the Metro 2033, can't tell.
Still no quick saves, respawn is based on checkpoints, but it feels like the autosaves pop up more often and after a key moments, so you probably won't be forced to chop through half of the mission again after being killed.
Small tip at the end - If you encounter a TRAIN shoot it in the wheels. Yeah, who would have thought. The game doesn't tell you shit of course, but Metro 2033 made me used to it already.

The story is compelling and the characters are all unique and attaching in their own way.

I just loved the atmosphere so much, I'm on my fourth playthrough as we speak. Had to grind to get all the main story achievements, good ending, bad ending, ranger, ranger hardcore.
 
The karma system is a nice twist as well. A nice way to motivate the player to just stop and listen (or watch a truely aweful show at the Bolshoi Theatre :D) 

The music and the voice acting are engaging. Some story element really punched me in the gut. A third of the way through the game I was swearing at the writers for luring me into a false sense of companionship. Goddamn, betrayal stings like a b****

Unfortunately it's quite short like forty hours or so and even though you can replay different chapters I find the replay value to be quite low in regards to the story, because it's quite linear in story even though there are some tactical choices, it's not RPG and there are no dialogue choices.

Other glitches are also annoying where you can get stuck in a tight spot, you can't move any longer and the game will autosave you, meaning you have to go through the entire chapter from the beginning and watch all of the unskippable cutscenes.

I played on survivor and normal, and I never got enough ammo to justify the Valve I always carried around. The game very obviously encourages a few kinds of weapons, namely 5.45 rifles and to a slightly lesser extent, shotguns. Pistols that use .44 Magnum seem like they'd be very difficult to use if you're not killing everyone in one or two shots.

While I was playing 2033 I kept waiting for all the good stuff I remember, but it never came. Why was that? Because it was all in Last Light. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying 2033 is bad, because it isn't (it is fantastic, the Frontline level in particular), but I am saying that Metro: Last Light is significantly better (which is saying something because of how good the first is).

There is also far more content in this game than I remembered. The base game is around ten hours of gameplay, and each DLC is around an hour. Speaking of the DLC, if you were to get this game for any reason at all, it should be for the DLC. The Chronicles Pack (Anna, Khan, and Pavel) missions are whatever, the Tower Pack is too difficult, the Developer Pack is somewhat interesting, but the Faction Pack (Heavy Squad, Kshatriya, and Sniper Team) is where it's at. Of all the time I put into this game, those playing the Faction Pack were the most enjoyable.

Anyway, what about the actual game? I cannot recommend it more to anyway that is interested in shooters. Metro allows you to choose a play style, on that focuses on survival and one that focuses on combat, accommodating to both types of players.
