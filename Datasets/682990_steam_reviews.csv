The rest of the simulation... is...  not a simulation.  Since drug dealing in REAL life is so much easier, they made the game take place during a more severe post apocalyptic type time period.  With check points and cops who are truly dumb, not like real life cops.  You can buy all sorts of crap for your various hide outs... but you can't move things from one to another.  You know..... when is the last time you saw a drug dealer moving furniture?  Never.  They just don't do it.  So... that part of the simulation is on point.  The rest....  not so much.  

If you have played House Flipper, DO NOT BE ALARMED.  This is NOT the same game.  Even though it looks like it.  Also... thief simulator...  basically identical.  They likely all used the stock unreal engine for graphics.  

As much as I want to hate on this game I can't.  It has some how pulled me in so that I completely lose my peripheral vision while playing and get the crap scared out of me by my wife.  (In my defence I had just finished running from the cops with a large backpack of drugs and headphones on.)  

Can I recommend the game?  Well....  again only if you really like fedex style missions.  If you, or someone you know, has ever actually dealt drugs and you want to relive that god awful life....  This is not going to be the simulator you are looking for.  But... for 3-4 DOLLARS as it was when I purchased it....  it has been MORE than worth the money.  

I will watch for DDS2 though and hopefully it's more of a simulator than just packaging up drugs and making drops.  I mean...  you provided a bed in the first apt. but we never use it.  We never eat.  We never sleep.  We never use our own supply.  We just...  make deliveries.  day and night.  It's more like...  Robot Drug Dealer Simulator.

First off, let's talk customer service. Ever wanted to make a deal with someone who communicates exclusively in emojis? Well, strap in, because that's just the tip of the iceberg here. From needy junkies to demanding mob bosses, every transaction feels like a high-stakes negotiation...pun intended.

Now, onto the inventory management. Forget about organizing your sock drawer; this game throws you into the thrilling world of drug stockpiles. Ever accidentally mix up your ""happy pills"" with your ""not-so-happy pills""? Yeah, me neither... coughs nervously

But wait, there's more! Who knew running from the cops could be so exhilarating? It's like a game of cat and mouse, except the mouse is a little too fond of hallucinogens. Just remember, kids, crime doesn't pay...unless you're playing a video game, in which case, rack up those virtual dollars!

In conclusion, ""Drug Dealer Simulator"" delivers an addictive blend of chaos, humor, and questionable life choices. It's like living out your wildest Breaking Bad fantasies without the risk of actual prison time. So grab your balaclava and get ready for a ride you won't soon forget. Just don't forget to pay your virtual bail bondsman on time!

Patch 1: included some bugfixes

[b][u]April 21st[/u][/b]
Patch 2: some more bugfixes

[b][u]April 22nd[/u][/b]
Date of their fourth and final dev livestream where they would catch people up on the game development and answer questions about the game.

[b][u]April 28th[/u][/b]
Patch 1.0.4 (update 3): more bugfixes and a couple of small improvements

[b][u]May 27th[/u][/b]
The long awaited ""weed growing"" update. A lot of people really liked this update but it didn't fix the fact that there was little to no endgame content.

[strike]One month of them advertising other games from their publisher[/strike]

[b][u]June 26th[/u][/b]
Finally after a month of silence as far as the game itself goes, they mention that the next patch is ""just around the corner!""
As for what's included in the patch, the devs say this: [i]""It will include fixes for many common issues, optimization changes, map improvements, and more. One of the new things that we can reveal right now is implementation of the Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese languages to the game!""[/i]

Another month goes by

[b][u]July 20th[/u][/b]
As it turns out, everything they said would be included in the patch was [i]everything[/i] in the patch. Except even less. It was more bugfixes, a couple of optimizations, and yes, localization for Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese (according to some Steam users the translations are very bad and don't work well with the UI but I have not used it so I can't verify this). But that's it, there was never any ""more"". It's been two months and all we get is even more bugfixes which are almost trivial at this point because the game itself is still buggy, unpolished, and generally unfinished, and losing your save is only slightly less common. Players are abandoning the game and getting upset with the devs in the discussions.

[b][u]July 27th[/u][/b]
Announcement for patch 1.0.6 (update 6): The devs open up their community post by saying ""The important part is - we are currently 100% back in business and back to the old work paste! First of all - THE GAME HAS NOT BEEN ABANDONED.""
Things that will be added in this upcoming patch include -
- UI improvements
- Map improvements
- Graphical remastering
- ""Game affecting weather system, including rain and moon phases affecting gameplay""

People are finally fed up with the slow updates and the Steam discussions are as toxic as a nuclear meltdown inside a volcano of green sludge.

One user accuses the devs of abusing their power on Discord, although I've seen no one else talk about this and I've never been there myself so take it with a grain of salt.
[quote=darklight] the only place to get any real info is in their discord. though on there is a very cliquey group who like to attack everyone and everything like a room filled with trolls. and the admins are power hungry zealots that will throw their power around at random to get a kick or get a laugh. its [truly] the most toxic discord group ive ever had the displeasure of being in.

if you can stand being in there and if you happen to be around when a mod or a dev speaks about the plans for the game you might [hear] some news.

its the worst setup ive seen coming from a ""professional"" company.

so far they have made so many poor choices that putting main game elements behind a paywall wouldnt surprise me. they have been uncommunicative and lackluster so far so why expect different in the future,
[/quote]

[b][u]July 30th[/u][/b]
Devs release a devlog this time not in the form of a stream, but in a [i]slightly[/i] more organized video format. The lead developer opens the video by acknowledging the fact that they were quiet for such a long time and explains that this period of inactivity was due to office renovations and the fact that they were recruiting a lot of new people to their team. For the rest of the video he goes more in depth showing what they're working on for the next patch and admittedly it looks better than they made it sound on paper.
------------------------------------------------

          So that's the timeline of the game since it's launch. My conclusion is that Byterunners are a [u]very[/u] inexperienced team who don't really know how to prioritize their workload (working on graphical improvements while the community begs for more end-game content). Do I think the game is abandoned? [b]Certainly not[/b]. Do I think it will it take a [u]long[/u] time before the game is actually worth $20 or even sitting down to play for longer than 30 mins? [b]Definitely[/b].
          Give the game some time, like, a lot of time. Add it to your wishlist and check on it every few months or so. It's got potential for sure, and I still think the devs are hard at work, they're just not good at working efficiently.

bought it in sale about 1 year later.
played a bit just now. still looks like the demo. 
read what the community had to say...
 yeah no.
 already lost interest in it before even experiencing the repetiveness that was already creeping up during the early game phase. 

So heres what I gathered.

the game is running on 97% gpu usage, and Id blame a trash pc, but not everyone has a trash pc.

apparently most of  the content that was promised is still not released.
From what has been read, most updates only carry a fancy name, add a few boring things while introducing bug fixes that seem to break the game even more, while the old bugs are still not fixed.

theres no real guide book or anything, so you have to piece everything together yourself to prevent late game or to trigger the right events. 
wouldnt be a problem if this wasnt a parkour version of basically every dumb tycoon type game out there and thus damn stressful because the machines gotta keep on going. 

the community demands the game to be added to workshop...

instead the devs shit out a sequel with slightly better graphics, where you can become :
             
 ""da big boss""

Not falling for that, go suck a fat one.

basically means, everyone that has been enjoying this game and was waiting for future updates or fixes can go fuck themselves, because the rats are abandoning the sinking ship. 

its not like this hasnt happened with other devs/publishers before.
 but its always a disapointment seeing yet another studio 
join the ranks of the undesirables.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this.

Overall I would recommend this game to inquisitive young people looking to learn about drugs and how to sell them as i think this game does a great job on educating people on typical modern ""plugs"" and how they dilute your product with things like sugar, or attempt to get you hooked on their product by adding things like ""fenty"".

Ok, this game is really good. I love the mechanics (the drug dealing, jokes, packages, mixing, rep, and money laundering). The difficulty is nice. I love the center of dealing at night—that it is police hours to not raise your meter (which causes more police to spawn). But my only bad thing is the map design. Please note that I have not got sector C, but in sector A, there are fences that are placed just to block off the area, which makes the map even more maze-like. I get sectors A and B being blocked off and some of the fences in sector A, but the way the fences are in the left-hand part of sector A is pointless. Overall, besides the map design of the left part of Sector A, the game is great for people who want to have a simulator full of good mechanics, references, and jokes.",1705301049,1705301049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1705075789,1705075789,True,8,5,0.590890228748321533,0,True,False,False

Something about the micromanaging of a small time street dealer's routine and working all the way up to commanding an empire of illicit substances is both satisfying and a lot of fun.

It really feels like the renaissance of old cringey drug games on Newgrounds. Your narrator/player character sounds like the Postal Guy and says everything like he's reading the tagline for a D-list action movie. The world of DDS is unapologetically over the top and campy, but it adds a level of charm that the game benefits from.

Tl;dr should you buy this game at full price? Oh god no, not in a million years. Is it worth picking up on sale? If you like simulator games and the thought of producing and dealing in a ghetto, by all means, but I'd recommend waiting for it to drop under $5.

The low points:
- The controls. Breaking it down to brass tacks, this is a pretty janky UE4 game. It can be fun, but it can also break extremely easily. This game has an interesting relationship with the mouse and UI, because it'll only successfully work about 70% of the time. The other 30%, you're stuck doing the same action over and over again trying to get a response. Could it be worse? Sure, but it doesn't take away from the frustration.
- The GPU usage. It's gonna be using 100% of your GPU the entire time you're playing. This may be a minor issue for some people, but it may be a deal breaker for others.

The high points:
- The ways that this game delivers on its campy premise in spades. You use an app on your laptop to organize the buying and/or selling of your products, then you either go to meet with your clients to sell or find a dead drop to pick up your product respectfully.  
You use graffiti to tag up different neighborhoods and gain respect/expand your influence. It's a nice break from the cycle of buying/selling and lets you indulge more in the criminal aspects of the game. You can use your money to expand your operations, buying other properties, new products, customizing the properties you have, or paying for graffiti and other tools of the trade. You can also expand to the point of hiring your own dealers and running your own growing and money laundering operations. 

Again, if that sounds like fun to you and would enjoy the micromanaging involved in a street crime simulator, then by all means, I'd recommend this game (again, on sale- $20 is a pretty steep price for this.) Otherwise, there's no shame in skipping this one.",1704875111,1704964720,True,12,0,0.671384036540985107,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family.

The biggest con about this game i would say is how long it can take to grind things out when first starting out, but the game will and does pick up more and more with every few levels gain. Unfortunately there is A LOT of running back and forth but honestly i get it since you are a drug dealer so you would be doing a lot of travel back and forth to people, i just wish there was some other way of travel other than just running on foot everywhere, like maybe a bike or a moped. There has been a lot of good things added into the game that it really needed since it was first released, like you can now get a mansion once you build up your drug empire and become wealthy enough to afford it. Although one thing never really made much sense to me about the mansion, it's location is in a slums type area, this just feels odd and does not make a lot of sense, i honestly feel like the mansion should have been placed in a higher class type area that could have been added onto the map.

If you ever played the simplistic dope wars game, and found it fun then this will blow your mind. Think real world simulator as a drug dealer. Buy pure product cut it and experiment with additives and mixing drugs to create your own unique products. Too poisonous or addictive you get ODs, get the amount of addictive substances right you get addicts who pay more, satisfy a client enough they become a dealer. Oh and then the cops and the state, cop are everywhere and looking suspicious will draw a search. There is a curfew as well, so avoiding the cops is pretty much a top priority. And if you deposit too much illicit cash, well the state will draw interest. So you better find a way to launder that cash!

Buy / cut / resell drugs. Try not to put too much toxic or you'll have some troubles with your customers (sometime dies from overdose cause of your bad product). Quality and control over your client addictions is the key. Try not to get caught by the police. Upgrade your territory to the other neighbourhoods. 

The world we evolve in is just really nice, the evolution on the gameplay offer an oportunity not to get bored. There is questlike system, a bit of parkour (jump etc) for the one who are looking for it and much more you need to discover. This game is just a goldmine.

<<<<< GRAPHICS AND OPTIMIZATION >>>>>

The graphics of this game are very good, but the optimization is fucked up.
Reading according to the minimum requirements, my calculator had to pull it,
but in new locations the fps drops to 30 FPS.
The game is definitely not for weak PCs, but I don't think dealers are sitting on a calculator.
I'm not a dealer, so I can.

<<<<< PLOT >>>>>

The plot is quite linear, but thanks to the gameplay it becomes more pleasant.
BUT ...
After you have already conquered all the territories in sectors A and B, it goes to what-
that's a hell of a wanker experience. We have to wait weeks for the order to fill
500 mafia respect. Well, in order not to miss this time in vain, I just sat and
grew weed on my balcony, and by the way, this is not about the game. I was put
away for 2 years and even after I leaned back, 500 EXP was never collected. If without
water, then this is a hell of a jerk-off, during which you can fall asleep out of boredom. For the whole of this
the stage, provided that you skip every 8 hours and go to rinse the grass, takes 3-5 hours. Okay, never mind. Most recently, the developers rolled out the final storyline, this is pizdec nahuy blyad. Waited half a year - take it eat it. The last
missions are completed in 2 hours, if you play honestly and without guides, and in the end
the plot goes into some kind of wilds.

In general, 7/10 for waiting.

<<<<< ARTICLE 228 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION >>>>>

The first hours of the game are very easy and pleasant, the time goes unnoticed
An interesting system of crafting and mixes, but the cultivation of ferns is linear.
They are diluted only by attacks from the DEA, and then they come every year in the 7th month
3 days when the waxing moon rises.

9 out of 10 bad trips from ibuprofen

<<<<< SOUNDS AND MUSIC >>>>>

The most special thing that is in this game. The music completely conveys the atmosphere
of the American ghetto, grass and shootings. A lot of music has been added to my playlist

TEN OUT OF TEN FOR THONIO - LIQUID

<<<<< RESULTS >>>>>

I think this game is one of the best just because of the music. With music, they
polished absolutely all the jambs and flaws of this game

I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of.

It is very monotonous and pretty grindy. For the most part you are running or sneaking around the map, trying to deliver the goods without being caught by the police. It might be thrilling early on, but after a while it gets a bit stale.

After playing for over 230 hours, I'm left with a bitter-sweet mixed feeling. I still give this a thumbs up, because it's not a bad game and I did have my fair share of fun. I just wish there were more depth to it than running around as a delivery boy. 

So, before you buy this, try the demo! If you like it, then it might actually be worth it. If it's on sale then it definitely is!


GOOD
- Currently the only good game of its genre (""Weed Shop 3"" doesn't count, that's a legal grow/dispensary sim. It's good though, but maybe even more grindy than DDS).
- Mix/make your own stuff using functional lab equipment. Just remember that your customers demands a certain level of quality and a bad product can kill them. So be careful what you mix and how much.
- You can use the products and observe its effects on your character. Hint: [spoiler] Some might be very beneficial. [/spoiler]
- Recruit dealers and sell larger quantities.
- Several buildings are for rent, which you can use as hideouts or set up as a lab and assign crew.
- You can buy villas and decorate them, but they are very expensive!
- OK, but not great, selection of furniture and decoration for your hideouts/labs/villas.
- Good in-game music (it's a shame that you can't buy a stereo/radio for your hideouts).

NEUTRAL
- No vehicles or guns.
- Can't go inside ""Two Towers"", the party building.

BAD
- Making money and progression is grindy!
- Sneaking around the police, gets boring after a while.
- The way the police is patrolling the streets is unrealistic. They will almost always stop and search you if your in their near vicinity.
- Police hours between 21:00 and 07:00, which means people are not allowed to be outside. You will be arrested even if you don't carry anything illegal. I get why this was implemented ([spoiler] customers pays more and your activity is less noticed [/spoiler]), but it's kinda dumb. Police doesn't have any issue with everyone else walking around.
- City is split up into three regions. Each time you travel to another region you must pass through a police post at the border which means they will stop and search you. There are other secret ways to travel between the regions, like [spoiler] the sewer [/spoiler], but it requires frequent lockpicking and after a while just feels like a chore.
- Lab UI is not especially user-friendly and makes everything very tedious, even the simplest task as splitting your products for your customers. It's a bit of a learning curve for new players, but not the worst I've seen in games.
- City feels dead and lifeless, partly by the fact that there's no traffic but also because there's few NPCs walking around. They also act kinda robotic.
- Lockpicking. You have to lockpick the same locks over and over again, since they automatically lock after some time. I really wish there were a lockpicking skill, making it faster and easier to lockpick later in game.
- Police chatter (mainly there for you to hear the police coming) goes like this ""......, OVER!"". Nobody uses the closure phrase ""over"", that's from way back in stone-age times. It might not sound like a big deal, but after 230h+ it becomes very annoying, especially when they sometimes camp right outside your hideout while you're trying to do some cutting/mixing work.
- Map size is fairly small.
- Story is a bit short. It's just ends way too early. After the story ends, you haven't exactly finished the game, but you now have to find your own motivation to continue playing. Either it be achievements, the villas or whatever.",1698555403,1698555403,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:

[list]
[*] The map is amazing - a huge rundown, segregated neighbourhood, truly makes you feel like you're in ""the right place"" to sell drugs;
[*] Fairly decent police system - the more reckless you are when selling your goods, the more police attention you'll get - forcing you to manage your playstyle accordingly;
[*] Up to nine different drugs and ten secondary ingredients which you can use to create your own mix;
[*] The storyline/lore is quite interesting and compels you to play further;
[*] The gameplay in general is pretty entertaining
[/list]

Cons:

[list]
[*] Occasionally it feels like the map is TOO big, which can be frustrating at times;
[*] Once you get used to it, the police system is nothing but a nuisance to you. Excluding what happens in the storyline, it is also the only type of adversity you'll find in the game - no rival dealers, gangs, snitches, traitors, undercover cops, nothing. The dangers and unpredictabilities of being a drug dealer is simply not there. This is IMO one of the biggest flaws with the game.
[*] The drug managing/mixing system is awful, especially due to the randomness of the clients' orders, this can be really frustrating for many players.
[*] The storyline feels more like a backdrop, a secondary element to the game, and while it is compelling, it also feels rushed and not very well-polished.
[*] While the gameplay is entertaining in general, it is only for the first few hours of gameplay, or at most until you finish the storyline. After doing so, the game just feels repetitive and eventually it gets boring.
[/list]

Sadly, it feels like the cons outweight the pros in this game. It appears the devs focused too much on the namesake of the game, which just results in a cycle of:

[olist]
[*] Obtain drugs
[*] Get clients' orders
[*] Sell drugs while avoiding police
[*] Repeat
[/olist]

Combine this cycle with the cons and you'll find this game leaves much to be desired. The game is true to its name, you can sell drugs to your heart's content, but eventually you'll just grow tired and bored of it, similar to your 9-5 job.",1698005505,1698005573,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good stuff first: Gameplay loop is easy to understand, sometimes hard to execute, which leads to simple but enjoyable gameplay. Pretty simple shit. Order product, pick up product, portion out product based on who wants what, take that product to people, pay your suppliers, order more, repeat. Throw in a cop or two here and there, or maybe curfew is on, and it's great. A few high speed chases perhaps, some adrenaline, feelings of satisfaction sneaking around like a dope ninja... all good stuff. 

There's some halfway decent humor and otherwise strong messages to be had in this game, and the environment is, if not stellar, than not the absolute worst I've seen. Still pretty bad, and the animations could use some work, perhaps. A bit moving or ""shocking"" here or there (Looking at you, Stoned bee which made me jump) but those are most certainly not what you're playing this one for.

Progression is slow, but that's seemingly by design. Can't be a drug lord in 15 minutes or less, it takes some time and skill. Unlocking things like growing your own product, being able to sell new products, and moving through checkpoints, great, love it. Feels good. 

Now on to the stuff I really don't understand or like:

Mouse smoothing / acceleration. It's not 2010. I am not playing with a trackpad. I have no interest in having my character spin like one of those flying fairy toys that get sucked into fireplaces. Fix this shit. Which leads to the next point:

Devs are pretty dismissive of criticism, as one would expect from a team behind this quality of game. To the point where it seems like they just don't care. I would say this game isn't dead, more like on life support. Devs push maybe part of a feature, maybe something small, something that wouldn't take more than a little while to develop, and make it a full update. The game's not dead only because development is a crawl. Sure, some new features are out and they're okay, but a lot has been promised, either in trailers or concepts, and not much has been delivered. On the topic of those new features...

Optimization. There is none, hasn't been for a long time now. Of course, making features work would take away from the budget for new things being added, and fixing things is a hell of a lot less interesting when you can lure people in with new things, no matter if it breaks everything and your framerate is capped at about 30-45 frames for long periods of time, only to return to normal for a few minutes and then dive again. Sorry if that's a bit harsh, but there's absolutely no passion put into the whole process, I feel. It feels like a scam, but hey, the gameplay is just okay enough for me to say it's probably not, maybe. 

Overall, if you're bored or you see this game on sale and you'd really like to try it, there's always the free demo, and I'd advise trying the ""Free Sample"" first. If you like it, great. It's not great, not utterly abysmal, just okay, but not really worth the rating of Thumbs Up for steam, kinda right in the middle. The mouse smoothing thing puts in into the negative cause I feel like I want to vomit. At least you can adjust motion blur.",1633534317,1697952016,False,1,0,0.494845360517501831,0,True,False,False

Negatives:

Let's get the obvious out of the way first: DDS is a debut indie game. Not only did the devs have to do without a AAA budget, but they also learned by doing. And while the devs listened to feedback from fans, implementing most suggestions would’ve required a complete overhaul of the game. So many of these suggestions were incorporated into the development of DDS2. 

As such, if you’ve bought DDS2 and are here to see where it all began, be aware that many of the features you probably take for granted aren’t here.

You will do most tasks yourself, manually. So be prepared for repetition and tedium.

The tutorials are spotty—especially when it comes to mixing product. Each product is different, and you WILL NEED GUIDES to help you not OD clients. Even a few in game lines of dialogue to walk you through your first mix would’ve been INSANELY helpful. And when it comes to things like addiction mixes, premixes, gang mixes… Well, I’m beating the drum kind of hard, but you get the idea. Mixing product is a science, and neither I nor the MC voice-over remember high school chemistry class.

The same thing goes for the quests. There isn’t any hand holding. Again, even a few in-game lines of dialogue—Like, on the Psychedelics mission: “Hey, what’s that candle doing there? That could be the signal. Go on, check it out! The message has to be in a container somewhere.”--would’ve helped. And I mean a lot. Again, check the DISCUSSIONS tab on the Community Hub for quest guides. You. Will. Need. Them.

And the AI spotting for the police can be downright off. Sometimes, cops won’t be able to see you close to them. Other times, they will spot you through the 3 inch sliver between the two buildings you were hiding behind. 

Positives:

STORY: DDS is a game that defied convention. Where the boldness of the devs was joined by a player base that wouldn’t let YouTube demonetization and social stigma keep us from sharing the game with others. And that shines through starting with the concept. The story isn’t ham-fisted—we get just enough to justify TRAPs and why there are no weapons, sector lock downs, and curfews. But I hope the social situation with TRAPS is explored more in future sequels, and how these events affected people who will likely need our product to cope.

As for the game, you go from small fry to running the show—and who doesn’t love that?

MIXING: Yes, there is a trick to mixing. But making your own mix is awesome and something I find enjoyable. Moreover it really reflects your personality: Are you a perfectionist who goes for quick addiction mixes, then cheap addict mixes to maximize profit? Are you a poison peddler looking to cause trouble? Or are you the one who knocks on that and makes the purest, safest universal mix knowing that clients will (eventually) get hooked on a quality product, and forever remember your name?

SELLING: To be honest, this is the experience that I bought the game to simulate. Meeting clients, making the sales, allying with dealers, setting prices—Dealing is literally the name of the game.

TL;DR

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and, as of writing this review, I am eagerly awaiting the sequel to get my next fix.",1697673246,1697673246,True,6,0,0.567567586898803711,0,True,False,False

The game was so promising and I was one of the earliest customers to buy this game. But after 3.5 years they did not manage to fix their game and make it ACTIVELY worse through non-optional ""updates"". Here is a list of things that should be reason enough for someone to land on the streets and play homeless simulator in real life. 

1. The game does not even start unless you add specific console commands because the developers are too lazy to fix it
2. The customers order stuff in incriments of 9 and 94 etc. instead of standard sizes despite the entire playerbase wants them to change that they refuse to change it for 3.5 years
3. NOBODY wanted the developers to add sewers especially if they do not make traveling any faster. This is not supposed to be a walking simulator
4. NOBODY wanted the developers to add lockpicking especially not if the mechanic is entirely broken and there is no reliable way to break locks except trial and error. The lockpicks are just so sensitive they break instantly if you are just 0,001 degree away from the perfect spot. 
5. You have to lockpick every door every day because a if you open it once it will not stay open at all. So do not think if you finally manage to get a glimpse of the stupid lockpicking system it will give you ANY advantage. The developers said they did this on purpose but this is just a lie. Their game just has dementia and cannot remember if you changed something in the open world
6. If you buy equipment and do not plan for all of your 30 hideouts in advance your money will be lost because after 3.5 years they could not figure out how to transfer your equipment between hideouts. So if you need a mixing tray in hideout 17 but you have one in hideout 19 instead you are screwed. 
7. I sell uncut and pure stuff and my clients all complain about it having bad quality. Well, there is nothing I can do to improve the quality from 100% pureness upwards. 
8. In conclusion there are just too many things to make the game less fun and put idiotic obscatcles into everything the players wants to do. The game concept is just so cool but you will feel disappointed all the time because there is actually no freedom in this game and you have to do figure out a specific playstyle around all the obsctacles the developers failed to fix and do the same things over and over. 

It's just sad. When I play this in April 2020 I had high hopes but now in October 2023 the game has made so many steps backswards. I am really thinking they will butcher the sequel as well. Movie Games should step in as soon as possible to save this franchise from incompetent developers.",1697113180,1697195111,False,3,1,0.504518032073974609,0,True,False,False

It's pretty much like every other simulator in that it's repetitive (naturally) except that there's a whole lot more going on to the point of it being overwhelming, in my opinion. It's a game where you really need to use 110% of your brain, be 110% efficient, plan ahead, strategize, micromanage and deal with dozen different things all at once. You should also be somewhat good at maths. Absolutely not a chill game but maybe you're into that. 

You've got to make sure you're keeping a low profile, that you're always stocked up on all the different products, find the time to cut/stretch/mix, prep and organise everything, deal with your dealers/clients (clients have a time limit), keep reputations high in a dozen different areas, hopefully not forget to water your weed, smuggle the products from one sector to another, hopefully not get lost in the sewers, avoid the police, tag and/or give out free samples to boost rep/attract new clients and then after all that give the cartel all your money (debt), etc. There's a lot to deal with.

Personally, I found a notebook and pen handy to have on hand while playing for writing down recipes/mixes and such. 

A lot of things are tedious/time consuming and just plain annoying for the sake of being annoying, like the time it takes to be searched, tag, refill water bottles, search garbage for loot for laundering, etc. The devs also seem to go out of their way to [i] fix [/i] ""exploits"" like parkouring in order to move from one sector to another. I guess they want you to use the sewers which are difficult to navigate and easy to get lost in - lots of dead ends and locked gates (p.s. This game has the worst lockpicking I've ever had to deal with). I'm not sure why though - why does it matter if a player chooses to be more creative in moving around the map and playing the game?

Luckily, there are a few mods on the Nexus that can eliminate many elements which you might not like, e.g. the reputation degradation (I found that by removing that, it made the game a whole lot more chill and I was able to relax, take my time and focus on what I wanted to). After all, druggies shouldn't be so demanding and I'd say in reality it doesn't work like that. A lot of QoL mods there too - I must've installed about 5-6 mods all at once by the time I'd ran out of patience. Trust me, you'll simply be saving yourself hours of time and/or make the game actually playable and to your liking.

I find the gameplay is quite addictive - ha, get it? Cos like drugs? Okay... The spooky sewers and night ambience, stealth and sneaking about, evading police or getting chased by them is really fun - adrenaline! The whole process of getting the products and organising them and/or mixing with additives like baking soda, sugar, painkillers, etc, is fun. Experimenting and pretty much making/naming your own product, making the deliveries and slowly working through the story. There is a feeling of progression from small fry to boss man and becoming somewhat more self sufficient - feels good. Your inner monologue (the narrator) is pretty cool and kind of sounds like Postal Dude.

Repetitive, tedious, big learning curve, awkward at times and feels like work sometimes (especially without mods) but there's definitely plenty of fun and satisfaction to be had and room for a bit of imagination.  

I haven't finished yet but yeah, I recommend it. I only paid £2-3 or something so... 

I might've had a different opinion if I wasn't able to mod the game/remove some of the annoying shit though.

Rogue Rating ★★★★☆ (4/5) 

Ladies and gentlemen, brace yourselves because Drug Dealer Simulator is here, and it's more addictive than grandma's secret cookie recipe! I'm awarding it a Rogue Rating of four out of five trench coats because, let's face it, where else can you become a criminal mastermind hiding in sewers from the fashionably late police?

This game takes you on a rollercoaster ride through the criminal underworld, and trust me, it's a wild one. You'll start as a small-time dealer peddling products that wouldn't impress a goldfish. But with the right connections and some street smarts, you'll be pushing more stuff than a salesman on Black Friday.

Now, let's talk about the sewers. In Drug Dealer Simulator, they're like your secret getaway spots, your Batcave if you will. When the fuzz is hot on your heels, you'll find yourself crawling through the muck and mire like a ninja on vacation. It's a hide-and-seek game where the stakes are higher than a giraffe's basketball match.

The graphics in the game make you feel like you've stepped into a gritty crime drama. The mean streets are meaner than your aunt's cat, and the neon lights give the place an ambiance that says, ""Welcome to the danger zone."" And speaking of danger, don't forget to check your corners when you're sprinting through dark alleyways; you never know what's lurking in the shadows.

Managing your drug empire is like trying to organize a bake sale in a prison cafeteria. You'll need to keep track of your inventory, avoid undercover cops, and make deals with the shadiest characters this side of the Mississippi. It's a balancing act that makes juggling flaming chainsaws look easy.

As for the community, it's a mix of seasoned crime lords and newcomers who probably shouldn't quit their day jobs just yet. You'll find tips on evading the law, tales of epic getaways, and debates on whether pineapple belongs on pizza (because why not?).

In conclusion, Drug Dealer Simulator is a hilarious and intense ride through the seedy underbelly of the criminal world. If you've ever wondered what it's like to be the ultimate hustler, this game will give you a taste. Just remember, in the world of drug dealing, the sewers are your sanctuaries, and the police are your personal party crashers. Enjoy the thrill, but keep your nose clean, metaphorically speaking!",1695575145,1695575145,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

also on my new PC the game won't even launch, i'll press the green start button and then 5 seconds later it'll go from a blue stop running button back to the green start button even though i fit the system requirements (task manager doesn't even show it as running) and there's no fixes available online, ive tried every website and gone through multiple steam threads but i've seen no fix. i've validated files and have reinstalled the game multiple times but still won't run. can't recommend it right now but im sure that will change soon

JULY 2023 UPDATE:
after THREE (3) YEARS i found a fix. what'd i do was about every month i'd reinstall the game and see if it would ran and the same thing i previously stated would happen. well, i finally found a fix. after 3 years, turns out this game has an issue with processors like mine (i7-11700kf) & you have to press WIN+R & type in ""SystemPropertiesAdvanced"" and tweak with your system variables. Yea, after 3 years, it was that simple. I look like a fool. So, I go back into the game that was so beloved to me at the time. Is it the same? Has the game been changed at all?

(by the way if you are facing that same issue and think what i did would fix it here's a guide: https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019775837?product=gog) 

For the record, I used to be an official beta tester for this game. So I know all about all the suggestions that was suggested at the time (including bugs that needed to be patched). When are psychedelics going to get added? Will you make the game harder? When is there going to be an ending? The map is too small, when will you add more places to go to? When will there be drug labs? Drug use? Can we grow marijuana plants? Will you add money laundering? GUNS!? Well, I'll dive into this.

-> Looks like most of the bugs that the game used to suffer from has been fixed. I've experienced minor bugs but it's nothing game breaking or detrimental. 

-> Psychedelics have been added to the game. You have to go through some hoops to unlock them (which keeps things interesting instead of just unlocking them through your laptop). 

-> Game has been made harder. I've noticed exposition (factor that controls how much police are on the streets and if the DEA is tracking you) has been tweaked with. You can't just deposit money in your ATM at night anymore (which used to basically give you no exposition). You have to go to hideouts and give a shady man your money and he'll launder it for you. The manholes/sewers has been tweaked with. You used to be able to just enter a sewer near the market and it'd automatically teleport you to Sector B. This was a problem because police would patrol right over that manhole so if you spawned at the wrong time you were screwed. Now there's an entire maze of a sewer you can access, with gates that need to be pick-locked to access more of it. You can also peak out of manholes so you don't just spawn right on top of a police officer. There's now also more police checkpoints. There used to be only 3 checkpoints: at all three entrance ways to Sector B from Sector A. Now, at night time, random police checkpoints will spawn on the street with two police officers watching each side, making you take alternative routes. It also seems like the police are more dedicated to chase you & have a larger field of vision. And the perk that gives you a percent chance of being searched with drugs on you and them not being found seems to have been nerfed. I remember just walking through multiple checkpoints and my drugs not being found. I ran an experiment where I saved with a gram of drugs on me and went through a checkpoint and they were found all 10 times (even though 1 time it said I was caught during police hours even though it was noon). The duffel bag has also been nerfed. You used to be able to throw the duffel bag across the Sector A/B wall with ease, now it's basically impossible without doing all the mathematics and getting your trajectory right. You also used to be able to just put a bunch of drugs in a duffel bag, take the one manhole to Sector B, and then hide a bunch of kilos in the warehouse near the Sector B manhole. Now, duffels seem to be kind of useless and you can't enter the sewer with one on. You can wear a different backpack and place a full duffel bag in the separate backpack, though. By the way not hating on any of these changes, makes the game harder & less repetitive. 

-> An ending has in fact been added. No spoilers though.

-> Old news but you can in fact grow marijuana :) My game started experiencing the not starting issue within a week of this update happening like 3 years ago, lol. 

-> Map has been increased. It used to be just Sector A and Sector B. Now you got Sector C (basically Sector B but harder to access) & a camp on the border of the map in Sector A.

-> Drug labs have been added (at least from what I've read). I for some reason can't access them even though I fit all the requirements but I'll end up figuring it out. 

-> From what I've noticed you can't use the drugs you make (at least from any obvious menus, I've been focused on selling them!). But there does seem to be a health system that I never noticed before. If you go below a certain amount of health, your screen will start acting like a drunken bastard and you'll walk slower. 

-> Still no guns but in my own personal opinion it would be a very unnecessary part of the game. But I remember everyone asking for it back then so that's why I included it lol. 

-> There's a lot more hideouts to rent & you can even build whole houses once you complete the game.

-> They've also finally added achievements to the game! Looks like I can officially 100% drug dealing.

The only problem I've experienced is the fact that La Ballerina (or however you spell their name) won't give me any more trafficking missions besides the first one, but I think that has something to do with not having a drug lab. Maybe it'll take me 3 years to figure that out, who knows?

Anyway, Looks like this game has improved a lot from when it was first released. Really proud of the developers for what they've accomplished. And now they're making a sequel? I'll definitely be checking that out when it releases.

If you are thinking about getting this game I'd recommend it. It's a really fun game that's kind of addicting if you get way too into it (the grind of selling so little to having to balance having multiple dealers & your own clientele all in different places of the map which have certain requirements to access and different levels of patience).",1589603066,1695271446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

IN SHORT;
Do not buy for anything $10 or less, it's a tycoon game that is not what was originally advertised.

IN NOT-SO-SHORT;
The original trailer for the game existed, of course, before the game's release date (THE trailer that got everyone to buy it off release) was taken down a few months after the release because of how inaccurate it was. It featured guns, rooftop escapes from DEA, some other mechanics that I don't personally care for, etc. 
- All mentioned are still not in the game to this day, 3 and a half years after release. I believe you can still find this trailer on YT but only by people who have reposted it; the original channel (PlayWay), as I said, removed it.

The developer's response to negative reviews are ridiculous and always consist of 

""sorry you didn't like it, we didn't do (thing in the trailer) because we didn't want the game to be like GTA (or some other thing). With the next updates I'm sure we'll see you back on the streets :D"" 

You'd be surprised at how many replies seem to be the EXACT same. And then the fan base will take some more acid and reply with the somewhat same exact zombie message as any other delinquent;

""DDS is made by foreign indie devs... you're an idiot to expect a perfect game lmao go play GTA""

If anyone reading this has played Ready Or Not, you'll know that their fanbase consists of the same zombies; complain about the product (which the consumer has the right to do) and you get multiple replies claiming everything is a ""skill issue"" and be told to ""relax"" because they're ""indie devs"" and/or be told to ""go play a different game"".

To this day there are spelling errors in the game (which I don't mind because it's not at all game-breaking and easily read-through) but the problem is the AGE of the game AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE MAKING ANOTHER ONE... That's right; Drug Dealer Simulator 2 - ""We gave up on the first game so let's make another one only to eventually make the same mistakes"". 

Pretty much, if you're tight on money, avoid anything from PlayWay, Movie Games, or Byterunner. They make, produce, or launch the same crap, mostly low effort ""simulator"" genre games.

Now, yes, you will see that I have over a hundred hours of play time... and after I post this there will be even more hours coming along; the reason for this is simple; ALL media (movies, tv shows, video games, etc) is boring; nothing is entertaining anymore. It ends up being the same cyclical system where I get really into one of the same 5 things and go replay the same few games... 

Interested in police, I go play Ready or Not and FiveM.
Interested in military, I go play Ground Branch, Six Days in Fallujah, and Ghost Recon.
Interested in survival, I go play Project Zomboid, Stranded Deep, and Green Hell.
Interested in violent crime, I go play GTA, RDR2, and Payday.

The cycle never ends... until it does. So, anyway, that's why you'll see I have more hours after this negative review; currently I'm back into a ""breaking bad"" phase so expect more hours coming soon.",1587149627,1694572128,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Always came back to it nearly every half year for a long while. I have no idea why it is so addicting about it  (probably drugs), but the gameplay loop is extremely fun. 
With all the updates you have a lot on your plate to play with and to work for, but i have to admit that the more and more clients you get the more and more annoying it becomes also. 
You can't have 5 minutes for yourself without clients bugging you for chumpchange deliveries. No way to lower the requests from clients nor can you actually shut down a sector if you do not want to deliver to it anymore.

Would be so much better if clients later on would actually be able to come to you instead. I know it is the intended gameplay to find ways around police and gates, but after doing it 500 times it gets just annoying and tedious, if you never ever really have anything on you, yet still have to be searched every single time you pass the gates.

Maybe implement some kind of ""trust"" system. The more and more police can't find anything on you, the more there is a chance that they just let you pass the gates without searching you. That or actually implement a feature to bribe police for a day not to look at you. 

Also the tunnel you can use in early game is the most useless feature i have ever seen later on, since he just asks for more and more money to pass the ventshafts. Seriously? 350 and more just to quickly pass it? 
Yeah of course you later on make so much money that you don't really give a shit about it anymore, but it is about early to midgame where it could have been an actual alternative to be used. Like this it is just utterly useless at the beginning and neglectable in lategame.

Also you should have added some creature comforts. Cook-Book that automatically applies recipes and adds ingredients for you. Even could have been some device you have to buy later on. Would have been a QoL upgrade you don't need but will love to have if you can afford it.

Oh well.
If you are into the idea to play a dealer and have a bit of an insight behind the scenes of some illegal activities like that, i can absolutely recommend the game.

It isn't the usual janky simulator game. It is an actually well made game. Even if it has a few flaws that do grind my gears. (Biggest one is when clients place their asses right next to a stationary police officer and you play russian roulette to try to deliver his stuff to him)",1694383493,1694383959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Drug Dealer Simulator is a game about, well, being a drug dealer. when i heard about this on realise i watched the development every now and again. eager to give this a try. now that i have put 40 hours into the game and done the main story. i'd say its not really worth it for FULL PRICE. if its on offer then maybe.

After playing for a while with high hopes. the game just doesnt really feel like what was advertised? it feels like your a tinder coomer but instead of hooking up your giving them meth or speed. which dont get me wrong works with the gameplay loop of:
-Pick up dropoff of your ordered drugs
-Check Orders
-Get the drugs and how much to the exact gram
-Sell it to each person.
-Repeat steps 2 thru to 5 until you need a refil
-Call up the cartel to give you more shit
-And repeat.

thats the whole gameplay loop for about 70% of the game. and i cant really tell if its fun or not. if you look at the advertised game then the game itself your going to be wildly let down. There is a Drug Dealer Sim 2 in the works as im writing this review. but i doubt itll be as good as promised. most of the stuff in the first was either added then removed due to bugs, or the devs just gave up trying to finish it. The game really does feel like that. Although im not talking to highly about this game or what its like. i myself havent or cant remember  any truly bad or gamebreaking bugs. but that might just be me. 

In short for all you goblins who cant read. Get it on offer. boring-ish gameplay loop. and not what was advertised at launch.",1693658556,1693658629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would recommend this game for anyone who likes money and xp oriented games since the bulk of the game is about money and leveling up.,1693315865,1693315865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The concept is golden.

The execution honestly. is quite shite.

I ran into multiple game bugs and reported them only to be told that I should try relaunching the game or reloading a save or many other reasons as to it may be a user error on my end.

The dev clearly has stated he has moved on from patching this game and is instead implementing any future fixes into the sequel instead. Which basically means from the sounds of it...this is kinda abandoned.

Also note the game has I guess what you may refer to as a tutorial...but its kinda on par to that of Project Hospital's tutorial. Which is pretty vague in its execution.

I am sure quite a few peeps may dispute my review...go ahead...im only speaking from first hand experience...so what do I know?",1693175307,1693175307,False,1,0,0.480158746242523193,1,True,False,False

Crashes from time to time for no reason and has no auto-save feature, which makes the crashes a lot more devastating since you have to restart from the last manual save.

Is it slightly clunky, especially if you just aren't used to the controls at first, or, like me, you foolishly tried to play this on a controller by mapping all movement actions (jump, sprint, crouch, etc.) to a single button? Yes. That clunkiness fades about 5-6 hours in, and then you're packaging illicit substances like it's Pablo Escobar's factories and dodging cops better than Sam Lake posting about his escape from Christchurch law enforcement on Facebook.
Now another warning: the graphics for DDS are not magic, super-slick new-CoD-release, AAA-game-studio stuff. It's sorta like the stuff from the late '00s and early '10s, when things looked pretty realistic but not so realistic that you can fool news stations with screenshots from RDR2. Trust me, this is an endearing feature. It fits with the timeline: the rise of small-time drug dealers, your best friends, the weird guy from high school, that neighbor who seems to be coming and going at all hours, your work bestie? They can all be dealers for you in this game, even the lady in a power suit who's really just a highly-paid secretary.
OH, and there's story in this game. No, this isn't just some bum ass ""simulator"" game that's ""oddly satisfying"" but also probably not worth the money (looking at you, Powerwash Simulator and Food Truck Simulator). Yeah. Keep an eye on the neighbors. Someone just might be a DEA agent looking to nail you to the broadside of a barn for possession with intent to distribute, or even RICO.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Edit:
I liked the game at first. A funny disclaimer on the loading screen, groovy music in the main menu, package management mechanics, a narrator's voice and even a flashlight on the phone. 

But the punishment system in this game spoiled my impression at all. Replaying all the long lost progress after I was caught by the cops (and lost all weed in the bag including 300$) who chase you like olympic runners because you didn't hear their female dispatcher on their radio and failed to see them in total darkness (and the game is really dark at nights) coming out unexpectedly from a corner was discouraging enough already. But i just completely gave up after I lost my bag completely thanks to the bug.

And now with DDS, you too can bake. Well, you can manufacture your own flavours of drugs, so its not the same but pretty close. 

What about gardening? That's pretty cool right?
Got some good news for you too, you can ""Garden"" in DDS. Albeit it's only weed. But you grow that shit en masse, flick it back to your garage drug lab, and never worry about buying it again. Shit grows out of the fucking ground.
Best part, flick it off for a tenner and BOOM! A sneaky (And ever so cheeky) PROFIT!

Do you like gardening AND baking? Mate, hold onto your chubby and get this.
Take that freshly cut grass you just spent weeks growing, crack it down into a crystalised product, whack that shit into the chopbox and you have powder.
Now you may be sitting there thinking;

""Sleepy, why would I ever want to take marijuana and turn it into a powder?""

Well, I am happy you asked my dear chumbah. Because you're gonna split it 50/50 with any other powder and you make more money for less. It's called ""Diversification"". Why does it work? Don't ask me how it works, I never give a fuck, it just does. Trust me. And it's awesome!

You got baking, gardening, public relations, business acumen, advertising, real estate acquisition, stealth, economics, chemistry and so much more! What the fuck more do you want from a simulator!? Do you hate fun? Do you love being boring? Just buy it.

Buy it right now, right fucking now! It doesn't matter if you're not autistic like me. Buy it or I will find where you live and tickle you with a feather until you do buy it. And you are going to enjoy it too. You're going to like it. You're going to love it even or, somebody is going to get fucking hurt!!

 I went from selling a few grams to pay bills to the f*****g cartel breathing down my neck. I now have thousands of dollars I can’t even spend and the DEA constantly watching me.

I would love to know what country doesn't allow it's citizens out after 9pm (Maybe it is a country that I have never heard of called Kindergarten). Okay, I get it, dealing drugs is illegal, but did they have to put in a reason other than drugs to stop and search players?? I don't think so. Also what's interesting is that as you are being searched the copper asks you are you carrying any weapons. Like I wish and also what drug dealer doesn't have a weapon and what dealer doesn't have a car? Like seriously this game is beyond a joke. After Rockstar killed GTA Online they at least let us have weapons and cars and there was no curfew in the game. I bought this game because I just wanted to give the game a try before DDS2 came out and with 89 hours of playing the game I think I gave the game a fair chance. I definitely would not recommend this game. If they add cars and at least one gun and forgot about the curfew then I might consider buying DDS2 but if they don't then it definitely would not be buying the next game.",1687985641,1687985641,False,0,2,0.459363967180252075,1,True,False,False

DDS is enjoyable and a nice change of pace from the type of games the majority of people play, but it is broken by the amount of game breaking bugs and issues the game has had since release. When one bug gets fixed 10 more show up, the bugs either break immersion or make the game completely unplayable. I bought this game when it was $20 and it wasn't worth it because of the amount of bugs.

One of the main issues following this game is the constant crashes or the fact it uses 100% of your GPU power because it doesn't cap FPS and instead of adding an option in game to change it you have to go into the local files and edit the config manually which is ridiculous for an issue that the developers have been aware of for a long time.

There is no auto save feature so if your game crashes and you haven't saved in a while have fun, for some people the game doesn't even launch it just crashes immediately after downloading and you wasted your money for nothing.

This game honestly had so much potential and yet they keep working on graphical changes but they don't fix the hundreds of bugs the game has. The developers don't care about any of the issues and they just want your money don't buy this game it's just not really worth it until they fix all the issues (if they ever do)

Let me say one more thing to conclude this. This game is honestly a lot of fun but you have to go through hoops to mess with game files to even get the game working without crashes and issues if you're willing to do that then this game might be worth it to you if not then its not.",1686968025,1687849037,False,34,2,0.731827795505523682,0,True,False,False

All while managing your funds, both legal and illegal cash flow, avoiding police and expanding your territory. Well worth the price tag and beyond.

AFTER ENDGAME UPDATE:
I started up the game again and they made it even better. Compared to previous versions it has become a bit more grindey, but it is not a boring grind. Somewhere mid to late game you will be doing variety of tasks to maintain your nefarious enterprise. Anything from procuring and cutting drugs, to selling to clients, to supplying dealers, and eventually to investing into your laundering business front and some more endgame features ;)

New Sector C is the largest of the three and plenty of opportunities there as well. Gotta warn you though, this game is a huge time sink. It will suck you in like those junkies sucked into your drugs that you sell.",1589453832,1687802179,True,0,0,0.498018711805343628,0,True,False,False

Even as the Boss, still a peddler, running around the map delivering ' by hand ', 
doesn't it sound silly.

' Addictive ' somehow, in the procurement, production, decoration of hideouts,
management of time and orders in ' getting there ' on time.

' Unbalanced ' and ' Coarse ' in awful lots of ways.

' Achievements ' asked too much of one to, to overdose 107 is still acceptable but to 
Overdose 909, that is plain silly.
' Story ' is short, yet
hundred(s) of levels, useless perk points, and nowhere to Spend.
' Unfriendly ' controls in redundant ' Long distance ' dragging and clicking, 
while delivery, item management, concocting while on the table.
' Darkness ', large amount of time in pitch black, faced dark skinned npcs, isnt a horror game.
' Jumping ', Brilliant at leaping off tall walls, yet problematic in ' stationary hopping ' over low sections.
' Much complaints ' of bugs/ conflicts from other users, but 
personally
the poor optimization, high resource usage, low fps as the map grows is a great disappointment.


Game isn't hard, 
just bare, simple, plain running simulator.
Lacking or simply too much room for improvements,


the ' Mysterious Ring ' 
https://steamcommunity.com/app/682990/discussions/0/3781371939905640513/
all the false talks and rumors of the Ring is to be found in ' trash containers ', 
led everyone on a wild goose chase.

Leaving the game as 94% completed, as
the remaining two achievements are plain dull and boring to drag on for another few months of pointless deliveries to meet  just to 100% completion.

I wouldn't buy it for 10, 15, or 20. 

the most disappointing thing is that the game lacks gang violence and shootouts and territory control. I hope the sequel gets it... i don't expect it to play like call of duty or battlefield, but equipping dealers, having muscle, dodging police and fighting to the last man has to be at least a part of being a drug dealer simulator.

They cut this feature from the game most certainly, and there are many incomplete features that clearly they could have added, but they decided to drop this, sell it cheap, focus on the new game.
I applaud them for being willing to start fresh and offer a cut rate on their game... its a smart move. it'll bring the game to many people (and it already has) and like the drugs you peddle, you'll crave more, more more. 

Great business sim. virtual coins are buggy and dissappear, selling doesn't work as intended, you cant conduct purchases entirely with virtual coins, and you always got to pay for your drugs with cash. later on the drug purchases take forever,  the drops are huge, and there's a little too much to manage even with dealers aiding you.

It's not entirely clear many game mechanics and you're left to your own to figure it out. good luck. 
In short... dont get caught, peddle drugs, start with pure drugs and then start cutting with baking soda and other fillers.",1686857023,1686857023,True,1,0,0.509162306785583496,0,True,False,False

I mean it was fun the first time.

So i played through again, up until i have to cross the border for the first time. Dropping in to the sewer, to find a whole way to navigate the sewers instead of just ""popping"" out the manhole cover that was pair up with it. COOL, i thought. Right up until i realised that the sewer was maze with multiple doors that needed lock picking and very few ladders to climb up. OK, slightly frustrating but still fun. I completed my ""business"" at the night club and headed back to base. Back to the sewers.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

While a few work arounds exist, anything that requires me to go tinker with my computer settings to get the game running outside of using compatibility mode or running as administrator is something which shouldn't be sold on steam, or should have a warning on the store page..

One thing to be aware of is that this IS NOT a GTA game, there is NO COMBAT OR OBTAINABLE WEAPONS whatsoever and no rival gangs (your gang affiliation is chosen automatically at a certain XP level based on your play style thus far and you do not interact with gangs you aren't affiliated with at all), your only enemies are the police patrols and the DEA. Police will fire their tazers at you if you run, that's the closest thing to gun play this game has...

As for the game play itself, it's highly addictive, more addictive than most of the substances you'll be selling ;)
Something about the way the NPCs are programmed and the layout of the map combined with the open nature of the stealth mechanics creates such a level of tension that it just captures the soul crushing anxiety of running around in places you really shouldn't be with things you really shouldn't have perfectly.

Pros good graphics, good skill system,  cool environment, good soundtrack, and addictive gameplay

Cons at the start where i am it is very repetitive where i am right now all the game consists of is buy product get dead drop get on the laptop split the product then go sell and occasionally cops will bust the deal after that rinse and repeat.  the cops can also be very annoying at times they will find you search you and you have to run from them if you have any product on you at that time, when you run they will chase you and sometimes will appear out of nowhere and taser  you and i cant figure out how to lose them also when you get caught they take some or all of your cash that was on you and they will take all your product. overall i am enjoying so far and i give it a 7.5 out of ten i recommend this game to people who want to play something different or if you are a fan of simulators this may be for you.",1683356984,1683356984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

SPOILERS
The game has updated a lot from what it once was, Some for the better, some annoy the hell out of me. But I am level 50, and have yet to get a second order from La Ballena. That was the best source of cash flow in the past for me. But now, I'm struggling to stock up, get hideouts, and progress further in the game. I read that a lot of people have had this issue with the gang bug. 
Then the whole production plants thing. I'm paying the same amount as i was from Eddie, and its taking up my hideouts, I have to go to each one, wait for hours for the batch. But theres no other option now. It's just inconvenient. 
Idk how people do the drug operation thing in 3  different sectors. I don't want to create a different enterprise in each one that i have to choose which one to manage. Because getting to each one can be pricey. or just time consuming. So i main in Sector A. 
I just miss the simplicity the game once was, seems like the notable bugs and issues have just changed it to where I'm getting bored. 
Hopefully the devs can repair this game. Or at least have DDS 2 top all the issues this one has. 00",1681590981,1681590981,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

with the development of the second game coming to a close, i felt the need to give this game the review it deserves. the addition of content from where the game started has been amazing, keeping it fresh and fun to follow along. the $20 price tag is really good to see, while the rest of the world steadily maximize their profits, indie games are becoming beasts in the industry. 

the game is really simple at it's core and i'm hoping to see it expanded upon in the sequel. dodging basic npc cops, running across the world to sell 2gs and not having much to do between selling the same people a ton of product; the game isn't perfect, but what is here is effective and feeds my lizard brain plenty of dopamine, while enjoying my favorite streamers.

if the devs are reading, i hope you'll check out the rest of my review, meant only with love and intent to help fuel this fire!
overall you all did fucking great, from voice acting, to the music, this is one of my favorite games and i hope the sequel is everything this aspires to be from it's humble start <3

suggestions (even if the release is close, hope you'll check it out)

1. less maze like sections, in what has come to be harshly branded a running simulator
2. reducing customers completely in sections you've obtained a dealer
3. less mini sections (west dead mid dead east dead) and just have one big section, it's a bit much
4. mixes that have different names, but the same mix not being able to be integrated (fix)
5. being able to move product right from inventory to storage (sometimes it's easiest to pull out 50 1gs and when you fuck up, it's impossibly boring to fix the mistake)
6. some sort of mini games in line with a rpgsim to juggle down time, especially early on, like eating, watching tv, gambling casino something man. rather than just clicking wait and staring at the screen for five minutes
7. less check points, more in depth police. even with minimum exposure the amount of cops don't seem to correlate. i just see squads of cops everywhere and all of these checkpoints, and the area is like 2 freakin blocks, even in a gaming sim, it is just sometimes way too much
8. would love to see more control as a dealer, picking spots to meet that become hot over time and use, setting times that people know you operate during, and having down time for other rpgsim mechanics, like sleep eat and pleasure.
9. with the amount of amazing graffiti art in this game, the symbol choice is disappointing, but still a really cool mechanic. instead of having a bunch of small places to graffiti, it would be amazing to see each sector have a specific spot you go to spray, and have multiple layers to the mini game when painting it, and once it's done, it keeps your respect at like 50% or something and you have to come back to maintain the paint!
10. would love to see more engaging relationships, the characters that are there are really cool, especially the narrator, (i'm hoping you guys bring them back for more, even if we'll be playing as eddie) but would love to see some more interaction when interacting. 

i hope someone from the dev team checks this out and i hope you see it as someone who loves and really wants to see the sequel do well. congrats and good luck to the upcoming release!",1681183966,1681183966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is set in a dystopian near future in which “guest citizens” in the US live in confined neighborhoods (ghettos, literally) heavily controlled by the police - complete with night time curfew, checkpoints, numerous patrols and random searches of pedestrians. 

You start out as a local low-level dealer with connections to the cartel. You slowly build your drug dealer enterprise from scratch, level up your character and increase the revenue, all while avoiding the police as best you can. You use your encrypted laptop to order drugs from your cartel connection and collect orders from customers. As you progress you’ll eventually get more connections who’ll help you launder your illegal money, buy real estate, etc. It is quite rewarding. 

You can create various mixes and thus change the properties of your products, e.g. make them less pure and/or more addictive. The mixing allows for some creative experimentation but you can skip this entirely and still do fine or, if you’re like me, just keep it simple and mix in a small amount of powdered sugar or baking powder to increase profit. 

The game doesn’t hold your hand - you need to stay organized and plan ahead: you must keep track of the content of mixes you’ve made, make sure you have everything you need before heading out to deliver the goods, etc. This is one of the main gameplay aspects that either makes or breaks the game depending on your preferences. The other main aspects are the aforementioned growth of your business, mixing of your products plus the stealth element that comes into play when you try to avoid the police patrols during curfew (at which time they will arrest you on sight). If you like that kind of stuff, this game just might be for you. 

Contrary to what one might expect from a drug dealer simulation, you don’t ever use violence or intimidation and you don’t have any real opposition in the form of rival dealers or anything like that. It’s all there just for you, really, and if you just avoid the police and stay organized you’ll do fine. The story missions are a bit meh - you go from A to B, talk to people, search for stuff, pick stuff up and put stuff in receptacles. Not much else to it. The final “endgame” update completed the story in a cool way and saw some improved animations but the missions were still all based on the same basic functions. 

As mentioned earlier, police will arrest you on sight during curfew but they’ll completely ignore your customers. There are a few little flaws like this. Also, and this is my main criticism, the world and the people in it doesn’t seem quite alive, it doesn’t feel like you are in a real world in which people live real lives which you can impact. They are only there to function as customers, vendors or obstacles for the growth of your business. This makes the game feel somewhat basic and incomplete. 

Still, even with the flaws it is a fun indie game which I’ve enjoyed a lot. It is unlike any game I have ever played and the final update tied it all together nicely. The game has been vastly improved since the first release a couple of years back and I look forward to what’s coming next.

The game is really a running simulator, just running around dodging pretty simple to avoid cops. I liked the game in it's earlier state where you could sell large quantity to Ballena Gang and didn't have to rely on 2g-20g sales.
    The devs seemed to break the game on purpose, I don't think anyone really likes selling less drugs in the game as that is the name of the game. I feel like this game was an early access, however it wasn't listed as such to my knowledge. Then instead of making the game better, they changed it to where people won't even order coke, and the ballena cartel orders like 1 small shipment a month... not even half a key for cartel...get real.(even this in game is hyped up when you do the mission he acts like you hit a big deal, nope)
    I know a while back they announced a dds 2, I wouldn't bother with it either after how they did this game. Shame because this is something people like to fantasize about, it could probably compete with GTA5, but they just made it a running simulator and announced a new game and broke this one... They always came out with grand promises of new content, hyping things making it sound better than it ever was, but all that was ever delivered was a nothing burger. I would recommend you not waste your time or money.
    At some point you have to consider that breaking the game I paid for and liked, and offering me no way to go back, is worthy of refund. I may have hundred plus hours in a game when I enjoy it but then you make a game breaking patch that ruins my purchase, that's BS. 
     It's theft by deception to offer someone one thing, then give them a different product they don't like, and not offer the original purchase or a refund because they are not satisfied. That's the law in brick and mortar business and it should apply to digital sales as well.---it doesn't, they are covered for this type of scummy business practice with creative rights and such, and the only way to combat it is our collective honest reviews.
    I'm just thankful that this game wasn't expensive in the first place, I did get some enjoyment from it in the earlier stages, sad they changed that new customers won't buy your drugs even if you hand out thousands of dollars of free samples, sad you can't do any big quantity orders. 
    As with any negative review I leave, I am doing this as a warning to hopefully save someone some disappointment. If you watch videos of how the game was(if you bother researching) and see things that look good... make sure the video you are watching is recent and not old information, do your own research and make your own opinion, this is just mine.
    I am thankful for the devs who put in hard work to offer me 248 hours of gameplay at a good value price, and hope they hear this criticism as just what it is, my honest opinion on the state of the game. Hopefully something can be learned for your future game, and I wish the team the best of luck in the future.",1680543183,1680543183,False,29,4,0.686258912086486816,0,True,False,False

The game allows players to run their own drug operation, starting with small-time deals and gradually building their empire. Players must navigate the world of drug dealing, buying and selling a variety of substances, and building relationships with customers and other dealers.

One of the key features of Drug Dealer Simulator is its detailed mechanics, which include managing inventory, setting prices, and avoiding law enforcement. Players must also manage their reputation, balancing their criminal activity with the need to keep a low profile and avoid drawing too much attention to themselves.

The game's world is highly detailed, with a variety of locations to explore and conduct business. Players can also customize their character, unlocking new skills and abilities as they progress through the game.

Drug Dealer Simulator also features a morality system, where players must make difficult decisions that can impact their reputation and the overall success of their operation. This adds an extra layer of complexity to the gameplay, as players must balance their desire for profit with their own personal values.

Overall, Drug Dealer Simulator offers a unique and engaging experience for players who are interested in the world of drug dealing and criminal activity. While the subject matter may not be for everyone, fans of simulation and strategy games may find plenty to enjoy here.

The game puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer as they make their way through the underworld of crime and compete against rival gangs. You must manage your resources, build a drug empire, and make money by selling your product to customers.

The gameplay is excellent, with lots of depth and plenty of options to explore. You can purchase and upgrade different types of drugs, expand your business, and even hire additional gang members to help you out. You'll need to manage your money wisely, as you'll be dealing with a variety of NPCs, customers, and rival gangs who will all be looking to get their hands on your product. It's incredibly satisfying to watch your business grow and profit, and it's also quite challenging as you'll have to carefully manage your resources and make sure you don't get in too deep.

The visuals and sound design are also top-notch. The art style is gritty and detailed, and the sound design is excellent, with realistic sound effects and ambient music that adds an extra layer of immersion to the game.

I understand that this game was made by a small indie team, is only $20, and compared to most sim games or games of this style it actually has some nice polish to it and actually has time and energy put into it. However, it has a lot of elements missing to the game that would take it from a fun time to a viral must play game that hopefully they make in DDS2 or give the game to a company with money, a bigger crew, and more time. 

Good:

-Game play is addicting and fun.
-Graphics are very acceptable.
-Some customization options in both locations and sales/location of sales.

Bad or Missing:

-Police: One of my major problems with this game is how the police work. The game needs to have a risk and reward system so it is nice that they implemented this with the police. However, they are extremely persistent which gets annoying. Being from a bad neighborhood where almost everyone is messed up on drugs I can say from observation the police don't care about shit, so for the police to search you at all hours every time they see you always gets old fast. I understand when the lights go down and it is police hours, but during the day when you are just walking around with a small bag I don't feel like you should be harassed by every single cop ever unless you were sprinting or had fucktons of drugs in a giant bag.

-Guns: What drug dealer doesn't have a gun?...I have never bought, sold, or used drugs but everything I have seen or heard is that selling drugs is dangerous. There will be junkies that will hold you up at gunpoint to get stuff for free, would be fun to blow them away if they try it. You have dealers that you give product to, what if they decide not to pay up? You hunt them down and blow them away. Cops trying to shake you down when you clearly have drugs? Blow them the fuck away and throw the bodies in the river/lake. All this could also be a system where you develop a reputation and no one will try to fuck with you, including police, because they know you aren't afraid to start lighting bitches up. So for the Dev's to tell the fan base ""If you want guns go play GTA"" is not only insulting to the people that gave them money but also A DRUG DEALER WOULD HAVE A GUN. Don't yell at your patrons because you are too lazy or don't have the money to implement things that would make your game better.

-Messages: On the phone don't work, would be nice to at least schedule a pickup or money drop off without having to go into a safe house.

-Jar Controls: Having to drag each individual bag to each jar is slightly tedious and not being able to put the exact amount of grams you want to take out is odd and tedious as well. Why can't I take a 4g bag of something why do I have to give my client one 1g bag and one 3g bag instead that doesn't make any sense.

-New Safe Houses: It would be nice if safe houses had a communal storage system, in the early stages of the game you run through drugs fast and can only buy so much at a time that chances are when you get a new house you won't be able to get or store drugs from there for a very long time so they are kinda useless to you aside from police escapes.

-Spending Money: I haven't gotten to this part but I hear what you can spend money on fades fast when you start making real money, you can't go on club/hooker binges, can't buy sick houses and vehicles so there is no real end game goal, and with no guns there isn't even the satisfaction of hoarding tons of cash and daring people to come at your empire. Also no drip or character customization so you can't even walk around like a boss with the swag of a God. Can't pay off the corrupt police force to not fuck with you (cause lets face it in a run down place like this place the cops would either be non-existent as mentioned before or super corrupt). 

I'm sure there are some other examples available that I either haven't gotten to yet or don't remember at the time but when it comes down to it is the game fun? Yes, it is the kind of game that you can lose hours to and be like ""oh crap is it that late already?"". Would I recommend the game? No, I would say wait for the second one that they are working on and watch some reviews/gameplay to see if they fixed everything. The game is good but it could have been SO much more and it is kinda sad to see them be like ""we'll just make a second one and get more money that way"" instead of fixing up and mastering the version they already made.",1676874136,1676874136,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",1676492221,1676492221,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It lacks workshop or any support otherwise and all ""updates"" literally consist of content that was already in the base game. ""Super Duper Graphics"" just means every npc is a cabbage patch kid with a receding hairline and ""End Game"" was just devs blatantly ignoring outcries from everyone, while they picked and chose to ignore any and all negative feedback and contact efforts from customers to have marketing pat any half-hearted positive reviewer on the back and shell out pointless updates for their little holiday jingles they wrote in back in 8th grade.

I can now with a good conscious give a half thumbs up. There were some inaccurate advertising problems in the beginning. What was advertised and what you got were too far apart. Steam should crack down on this (pun intended). You simply should not be able to advertise all the things you are going to do and not deliver a large portion of them without some kind of notation in the actual video letting the buyer know. Take that stuff down until you put it in the game or in the video let your customer know it is coming. Period. This was very misleading. 

Second, was hoping to go full on Heisenberg with a multi-city, large operation, large equipment, high tech lab, network and all that. We are still at emerging Walter White & Jessie mode... I will update as the game develops. This would be an excellent mini-game for GTA5.

Have to say it's been over a year and no content to speak of. They post updates that mean and do nothing. They have been talking about more territory for a very long time but its not there... Lots of chatter, no production.

What can I say about it? The title of the game delivers. It's a lot of running around, making deals, avoiding police, and inventory management

The Polish really know how to make fun games.

2023 EDIT: Since I made the review, many things have been added to the game. The new additions include better gameplay, an end game, more missions, and money laundering. So, money laundering.. it IS important, but do not consider that as a cool factor when it comes to buying the game because it is literally a necessary money sink and not a gameplay feature. 

Now that I have significant time playing the game, I have to say I understand it much better. There is a lot of room to improve in the sequel, but for what this is I find the price of the game to be more than fair. So, outside of buying, transporting, and selling drugs, I have to say the time spent in the drug lab is a bit better than I initially took it for. By that, I mean I dared to pull out a calculator to get the right drug mix. I try to keep my drugs 80% - 85% pure, and then use sugar and addictive drugs to weigh it down. The sugar is there because it isn't toxic and is just simply weight. Anyway, I would mix my drugs with stuff to weigh it down, then add addictive stuff like viagra to make my clients turn to addicts. Once I started to really focus on the aspect of making addicts, filling my drugs with filler, and making the right mixes then I felt like I was truly ""playing the game"". 

The downsides I would say is that the game can be relatively short if you know what you're doing, and by short I mean maybe 6 hours, but that is if you are playing this for the story and I hope to god you are not because thats not what we are doing here, ok? What you have as an endgame is a time dump where you are trying to earn and launder a lot of money just for some houses and pimped out drug labs. The problem with the end game is that I am spending half my time running drugs and the other half filling water bottles and watering plants. More variety would be nice, but I'm 100 hours into this playthrough so... thats on me. I keep going because I want to earn more money but there seems to be a ""cap"" on how fast money comes in via sales. Sales are the only way you can make money, and after 4 or 5 days I have earned about $40k, which then gets laundered into less money, to save up for $100,000k home improvements. None of this is necessary in the game, and it is at the end when you have nothing better to do so it probably doesn't matter.

Either way, love this game, it is fantastic, and I will be getting the next one",1588723239,1674536590,True,9,7,0.596119046211242676,0,True,False,False

Especially for the price point (and at time of this review it was on sale for just over $11) you're definitely getting hours of fun, if you're at all interested in simulating the subject matter.  

The game doesn't treat you like an idiot, and does some interesting things.  You can't ask for much more for $20, especially since they are still adding on to the game.

I'm happy with my purchase, even the short time I've played so far I've seen all kinds of longer-term content available to me.

I had gone away from the game for a time, and wound up trying to reinstall on my new computer.  It is currently the one game I have on Steam that will not even start.  I've got a high-end computer that runs literally everything else at Ultra. 

This is ridiculous that a formerly working game that I liked is now worthless to me.

I'll edit this review if the dev fixes this bullshit.

EDIT TO REVIEW:

I'm keeping the ""Not Recommended"" review up, as I finally had to go and dig up a solution myself.  Four months this review was up, and the Dev didn't say a damned thing.

If your game won't start, use this link:

https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019775837?product=gog

As you can see I have spent a considerable amount of time on this game and actually pre-ordered it so I have seen this game 'grow' from the beginning and can say that it was heavily falsely advertised before the game was released, as I believe they are currently doing with no. 2. The 'content' added was simple, sh**y and lackluster in comparison to what was teased and the game was pretty much over at about level 36 until this final ""endgame"" update, which come what, like a year into the games release?

Not only was I tortured with silence but the community is literally too braindead to grasp my complaints. So here we go again, the achievements in this game are not only mindless but also atrociously grindy. For instance, selling 1 ton of drugs. The maximum amount that you can sell to a dealer is 300g which isn't a lot considering you have to sell 1.000.000g for this brainless achievement. Then we have another brilliant one which demands you to kill 909 of your customers. And let's not forget the one that is literally impossible to acquire. You basically have to find an object in a trash can that never spawns. I must have searched 300 containers at this point with no luck. The public achievement progression states that 0% of players have these achievements which isn't a surprise. Who in their right mind would actually get these? I'm beyond baffled that people who haven't gotten any of these try to lecture me on how it isn't bad and that I should stop complaining.

This is a garbage 15€ game that I luckily got for 5€, yet I feel scammed. It's just like any other one of these dogshit simulator games. They even use the same fucking idle animations as Thief Simulator, are you kidding me? How lackluster can you be? How little effort can you put into your product? And speaking of product, let's talk about how awful this game. It's the same repetitive shit over and over again. You purchase/produce drugs, put them into smaller bags, sell them to people, and repeat this shit over again. The entire drug management system is an absolute disaster. For every fucking order you have to pack very specific amounts. They could have implemented a system that would restrict orders to specific amounts but that would probably take more than 2 braincells. You are constantly forced to pack additional bags of 1g, 2g, 3g just to get the number right. Asswipes, how about increments of 5g? How about making it less frustrating? No, that would actually require a minimum amount of brainpower. The entire system is annoying as a whole. Instead of making the process of bagging and mixing products as simple as possible they went ahead and created the most convoluted horseshit system I've ever seen. It really shows how little brain the developers had when making this. The AI is especially awful with some of the most random pathing I've ever seen. Stand on higher terrain and they run away from you for whatever reason. And don't get me started on the animations. They couldn't give the cops an actual animation when they search or tase you. Would be too much effort, right?

I'm done negotiating with devs that don't care about the quality of their own product. Maybe if you remove those achievements, refund my money, and post a public apology for your crimes I may consider taking this review down. As of now I'm fucking done. Why even bother at all? Why should I waste any more of my precious time explaining common sense to people who clearly have none? In any case, good riddance to this entire community. Maybe one day you will grasp what I was trying to accomplish here. Continue putting up with a garbage game that is broken to the core. I would like to elaborate on that but the entire game is one huge bug. I just love getting controlled by the cops twice in a row, really highlights the quality of your coding.",1673456402,1673456402,False,2,9,0.376018375158309937,3,True,False,False

i have some issues with the game though.
gaining gang rep takes way to long. i have become rich AF lvl 60 and have bought every place available to me.
and im only half way to getting the 500 gang rep needed to progress the game 
and by my calculations its gonna take another 40 or so game hours to get to the next stage.
by the time i get the gang rep needed ill be a million-air and i also feel there is little respect for the gamers time in this case.

another issue i have is with the rep loss over time - taking care of sec a,b and c and trying to keep the reps of all in the green is impossible . you barly have any time to restock drugs .
by the time i restock and take care of my plants all my rep has gone and i own every place for the bonuses ....
this seems a little wrong as you basicly have to run around like a chicken with its head cut off and then u need to restock and BAMM  all rep is like 30% again.

i havent even got my gang rep and iv maxed out all my stats, own everything , have massive amounts of drugs . but now i have 2 options use the wait mechanic to skip weeks at a time just to do gang missions or take 40-60 hours to get there naturally. either way the game could have been balanced better for the game to flow better.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

Played this game since launch and will fully admit it starting to get better and better over time. Especially the weed growing aspect was pretty dope and a nice added feature, as well as more quests if that's what you want to call them and a somewhat endgame if you will. Before the drug update you could basically turn off the drugs you didn't want to sell later on and only sell drugs that were making you profits and worth all the time you spend running around, and believe me this is almost a running simulator. Granted having the little drugs like weed and amp early game is def needed and lets you learn the in's and outs of the game as well as mixing. But beyond level 30 I would like to start feeling like i am coming up in the drug game. So like I said, before this update I could just turn on coke and H and sell that everywhere, and to everyone only. As I should be allowed, I am the drug dealer of course and you buy what I have to offer. Now what they did is tie the drugs to certain areas, Weed + amp and all the lower drugs tied to sector A. Meth + amp and sometimes a small amount of H to sector B, The big money drugs to sector C. I fully understand what they were going for, but being level 75+ I don't want to have to run weed or amp anymore, Especially after beating the game and they basically say the wold is now yours. Some of you might think well just run the coke and H still. Well again its only in Sector C and only so many people will order and its not huge amounts either. Been playing for like a week straight now and cant get a dealer out there to save my life. Literally none, and they are all addicts. Do not get me wrong, the game by all means is fun as hell to pretend to mix up all kinds of concoctions and watch the addicts flow in and your cash just pile up. With that being said as well they clearly reworked the gangs and they don't order as much and as often, that kinda blows as it was a great cash flow and made you feel like you made it big time. With a lot of the updates they did there was a handful of good things, Not going to spoil to much but the labs thing is pretty dam dope feature but still leaves a lot to be desired. Really hope they continue to improve on the game because they definitely have a one of a kind product here and could corner the market.",1672552060,1672552060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At least, they do seem to be updating somewhat regularly but so far there doesn't seem to be too much content being added and it REALLY DOES LACK CONTENT, especially for a supposed full game.

I really hope i can recommend this game one day as it does have some really fun mechanics and good potential, it's just too hard to see what the devs intentions are right now.

EDIT: Don't buy the new game (or only buy it when its heavily discounted). They mislead on the original games trailers and watching the new squeals one it is very clear theyre doing the same thing (obviously a animated movie, no actual gameplay shown so dont belive anything you see in the new trailer). The devs refuse to listen to user input and arbitrarily decide on complete game re-huals that ruin the point of the game. IMO its very possible they will abandon the squeal early on (The original is already dead, I've got the most basic achievements and apparently only 5% of players have completed them lol). All it seems they're doing with the sequal is just trying to dupe anyone else who hasn't already brought this one (The devs had so much potential for this game, it could have been so good but they decided to ignore user feedback and ruin any potential that was left for this game).",1614912511,1672136838,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like the game as you have some choice in  what you Sell and in most cases how your Product is cut but there are few choices to be made despite what the blurb on the Store Page would imply. it's basically who you work with in the late game that is the only choice.

there are now 3 gangs in the Game and you can join one as a reward for a side quest and you make a choice between the other two. The Basic Game play is pretty satisfying though.

My feelings are mixed. I played the demo a year or two ago, it didn't run well but it was playable. 

Now it runs like a crypto miner is hidden in it, but I think that's just because changing the resolution settings in game doesn't actually change them. Changed the resolution from 720p to my native 1080p in the INI configuration files, still not working. Writing this while playing the tutorial for the 4th time, because you can't save until you've gotten through the tutorial and the past 3 times, the game kept crashing my display/GPU and I could still somewhat play but it's definitely not the experience I paid for with my other monitor constantly flickering and making it impossible to click anything. So I wouldn't buy it unless you want to be forced to replay the tutorial a billion times because you have to restart the game to apply any changed graphics settings, and I'm pretty sure changing some of them doesn't even do anything. Game is borderline unplayable, just updated my drivers, restarted my computer, scanned for malware. So it's not my computer. I have a GTX 1070ti and an AMD-3700X, so while they're not the best, they're well within the system requirements, The issue only occurs when I have the game open. As soon as it's closed, I stop having the issue. And this is apparently very common, upon searching online to attempt to troubleshoot. I really liked this game when I was able to play it, but it doesn't even work.",1672080388,1672080388,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

PROS
- Good Game Performance
- Concept of the game
- Functions of Criminality
- Expansion of being a Criminal
- Decorative Items
- Ability to Property

CONS
- Police patrol visual is low
- Games have some bugs
- Short Days / Long Nights



EXPECTATIONS
Drug Dealer Simulator exceeded my expectations. It surprised me with its criminality functions and mechanics. Overall, it went beyond what I expected as a game.


FINAL THOUGHTS
I would recommend this game to friends, and it has plenty of DLC to get more out of it. Though I do wish there was a bit more crafting to the drug chemistry.",1671193991,1671931240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well 2 months later, thought I'd update my review, since it's all but fair:

They added plants, or basically a plant. There's different species of seeds u can buy, yet they are all exactly the same, since you will end up with weed. No special name matching the brand of seeds you bought or anything. 

The whole plant stuff adds about 0.5 hours of extra gametime ( and this is added at the point you don't even sell weed anymore because you will have unlocked far more expensive stuff netting you a lot more money )

Final verdict:

Since the people playing this game are very excited for ""weather"" being added and a ""remaster"" of a few months old game.. this game is pretty much dead.

Get the demo and you can experience EVERYTHING the game has to offer, expect the plant growing.

Sad, loved the initial idea, poorest execution ever.

EDIT: Endgame update;

Yeah, still less content then an early acces game, very unfinished, multiple players experiencing bugs where they can't even start the game.
Besides the fact that before dropping the ""end game"" update ( which is basically just dumbed down houseflipper added to the asset flips ) they announced that they couldn't succeed in what they initially planned for this game and are just abandoning it, while ofcourse at the same time announcing DDS2 asking you to please spend your money again.

 seriously tho, it's fun, addicting, and yes, repetitive. but the repetition varies. you might be moving product one day, buying some another, selling them another. the people who complain about repetition are the same people who say ""selling 7 bags of 2-3g of flower is unrealistic"". so is the idea you're going to buy product, make product, and sell all that product and make your full money's value all in a single day. you're not the columbian cartel. you're a dealer in the ghetto. the half of you complaining about realism have literally never dealt a gram in your life, so shove it. 

the other half of you are the ones complaining about the dev cycle. is this a perfect game? no. far from it. it could be so much more, but at the time could be so much less. this is a *good* game. not a great, award-winning, GOTY game, but it's a good game. and to be fair, i can see how the repetition is boring and unplayable. but that doesn't make this a good game. same way the grind of gta online doesn't make that a bad game. it's just not the playstyle you're looking for. don't be mad at the devs for not having the same artistic ideas as you. you can LITERALLY download and use the game engine they built this game with, so if you have such a problem that you have to leave a bad review over something not tailored to you, then do something about it.

Will update this post if devs decide to fix this issue. games unplayable with the severe performance loss.

UPDATE:
From the help of information provided on the descussion form with similar problems i had i was able to get the game running. If your having stuttering issues / unable to start issues follow this:

1. For no start issue: look on youtube for drug dealer not starting and follow the steps for getting it started
2. If you boot it and its doing excessive amounts of lagging/stuttering change your resolution to 1920x1080 for some reason the game HATES anything above that resolution.

I will still be leaving my review negative until DDS provides a problem free experience and i'm not required to have a masters in computer science to run the game.

The gameplay loop is addicting but after a while the game gets a little stale. Police become nothing more than a slight inconvenience that you can easily outrun, if you even get caught. Checkpoints are completely redundant since you can just throw your bag over the wall. Dealers have little use besides just buying more volume off you, they don't serve your clients for you so you'll often find yourself ignoring customers who want 2g of fet halfway across the map in favor of dealers who want 50g of fet and come right outside your apartment. Crypto is useless and I'm pretty sure bugged too because I've never gotten money after selling crypto. Like one reviewer said, clients buy in super goofy gram amounts that no one in real life would buy(17g, 41g, 33g, 58g, etc.) and after a while it does become a bit of a hassle. And also for some reason the model for LSD and Mushrooms is the same as the powdered drugs lol.

I recommend it for $6, which is what I paid, but probably not for any more than that. The game is a large pond that's just a bit shallow. Hope they add lean in the next one",1670823537,1670823537,True,6,0,0.59918743371963501,0,True,False,False

The development of this game was a mess, and the game was released two years early. It started off in an incomplete state. It should have been labeled early access until the 2022 Endgame Update. Now that the game is finished in 2022, I have better things to say about it. The Endgame update added a lot of good late game content.

This game is essentially a wide open sandbox crime game. It does not have violence/fighting in it, other than trying to escape police. It can get a bit repetitive, but I like that I can spend hours playing it.

It's been, well idk, yes they game has gotten a lot better it just took a long time.
The thing that will leave this review as a negative is the following : They already announced Drug Dealer Sim 2....

How i see this is as following, They got a bunch of money for this game but weren't happy with the total amount, decided to keep huge updates for this game unused in order for them to make a sequel and squeeze more money out of that.


@Developer , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV7j06tZzFY&ab_channel=TheSimuLP <- Remember showing us the ""official trailer"" of Drug Dealer Simulator?

Look at all the features that are in the trailer, now compare it to the actual end product, this is straight up false advertisement.

**Update 2**
We are more then over 12 months since my original review and 5 months after my first update, we are still at the ""they did fuck all"" state of the game, everytime i read their reply to my original comment, i get pissed off because... well just fucking read it ""working hard"" LOL, such a joke, i really really wanna play this game because it still has tons of potential but gosh... these fucking devs, only thing i will forever do with their game is pirate them, i will NEVER EVER give them my my money again, scammers.

**Update**
7 Months have passed since i posted my last review, at this point in time, fuck all got done to improve the game, it's seriously lacking content, yet the dev's mostly focus on the graphics of the game. the ""big"" update was some lame ass weed growning that stops being profitable uhhhh right from the start as you can mix speed.

Still negative review.

**Original post*
Good game, lot's of potential but in the current state + the attitude of the devs (update coming in 1 - 2 months) makes the game fun for the first 5 hours (max) then it's just a dumb grind to earn money to buy.... well nothing... there is nothing to buy... i have 1,5M Dollars stashed......",1590058099,1670780239,False,5,1,0.53000485897064209,0,True,False,False

1. You can add the required amount of drugs to a dealer but they'll reject it for no reason frequently: https://ibb.co/9VTxfzm
2. You get trapped in conversations with NPCs because you have to click their prompts instead of just spamming ESC to run away.
3. You can't adjust the game's gamma in the menus; you have to add code into the config files themselves. The default gamma is far too dark to see almost anything at times.
4. You can't fire dealers/clients. There's a limited amount of each you can have and if they're in a low-tier zone you'll just be stuck with them and you can't progress.
5. Even when you start selling larger quantities; clients will still add on stupid amounts which make it a pain in the ass to plan a drug run.... fuck you '302 grams' order... fucking round it to something reasonable. Because of this; at later stages in the game you'll still just be nickel and dime-ing your way through. 
6. You can only join 1 of the 2 gangs and even when you do they'll almost never send you orders. The whole gang thing is pointless.

It's a cool concept for a game but ends up just being a broken cookie-clicker formula. The story/missions can be completed in <2hr and the rest is just a grind. 

Apparently the devs have said they won't allow for modding so there's nothing more for this game moving forward. This game feels unfinished and yet they've already announced DDS 2.

Don't waste your money.

Key word ""potential""

Apparently, this game has had a lot of bugs even since launch that went unfixed. I had a dealer that became forever stuck since I could not collect my money from her. I went on the forums to ask how to deal with this, and I got a response that went ""wait, the devs didn't patch this glitch?""

Onto the topic of the missing content: I'm gonna go on a limb and give them the benefit of a doubt that these features just didn't get in the final game for one reason or another. Budget, technical issues, game development is a tricky process, especially for a indie game of this scope. Though, I wish they could be more transparent about it, which I think is the cause for the community being upset over this.

Something I am worried about is how they announced a sequel before the Endgame update came, which is extremely questionable. I hope the developers learned their lesson and make the second game at least better.

While I think this is a good game, I can't in good faith recommend due to some issues concerning the game itself and the developers.",1670453487,1670453487,False,1,0,0.452535033226013184,2,True,False,False

I've just started replaying it after the 'end game' patch was released and there were many quality of life improvements that I liked.  Still some jankyness but it doesn't usually interfere with my fun.

The gameplay does have some annoying issues like cops searching you 2-3 times at check points forgetting they searched you 2 steps ago but it doesn't happen often just feels lacking polish in some areas.  I also skilled the whole weed growing add-on, maybe I'm missing something but unless you're doing it for roleplay reasons I find skipping MJ a good way to progress through the game and make money faster.

That being said, the lab aspect of mixing drugs with other ingredients is fun.  I just wish it was more obvious what the results of the mixing was so that experimenting was easier.  I just take known recipe's off the wiki and that works well.  I hope that with content done they put some effort into QoL to make some tasks less of a chore.

Onto the negatives:

The UI is garbage. The laptop stuff is ok, but the equipment and management of your products is completely fiddly and unintuitive. Quality of life be damned. For instance you'll get an order for 19g of something, well you can't just make a packet of 19g. You get a choice of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50g so you have to add up packets to reach 19g. Now imagine you have 10 orders, which aren't displayed in any particular order, of 3 different products, all of which are random amounts. You have to work out what adds up to what, all in your head or on paper.

Navigating the map is a pain, some walls you can jump over, some you can't because reasons. The real hassle though is cross sector, which leads on to....

The sector system is the biggest issue I have with the game. You start in sector A, and eventually unlock sectors B and C. However it is not worth your time to bother with anything outside sector A because travelling to those areas is a major pain and you'll make just as much money in the starting sector. As such, I am now level 77, have maxed out all skills with more money than I can spend, and I've no interest in expanding into the mid or top tier sectors.

It's not drastically buggy, but there are some annoyances. I've had instances where dead-drops don't appear, clients that aren't interact-able, and the mission system itself doesn't seem to work. One of the beginner quests is to reach 500 rep with a local gang and in nearly 40 hours play I've only had one mission from them that got me 80 rep.",1670265818,1670265818,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

[b](+)[/b] Better graphics than the previous versions of the game;
[b](+)[/b] Won't lie, I could feel an overall improvement (new areas, new events, new missions, money laundering is ok now, etc), but it's still missing better mechanics; maybe in DDS 2;

[b](-)[/b] New updates didn't add much; didn't fix problems or didn't care about fixing them or changing things done wrong; basically decoration  (we just need bed/sofa, clothes wardrobe and table. Am I wrong?);
[b](-)[/b] The game becomes boring and repetitive as you level up (more customers, territories, missions) and do not realize this evolution, because you need to run like crazy from side to side (dealers just ask more quantities, don't help in any way);
[b](-)[/b] No need for recipes, just buy and sell drugs as it is. Game should explore it more, much more. Those guides out there? Waste of time and brains; 
[b](-)[/b] Inventory management is the most annoying thing that I had see in games. EVER.
[b](-)[/b] And many other things that makes no sense (and me sad/angry): farming is useless; AI is dumb and get stuck or frozen in place (I noticed much less AI people walking in the streets now. Why?); we still can't move jars unless it's empty; lack of instructions or descriptions (like how much grams a large jar has?); who the hell close all the gates that we had picked minutes ago?; you lose respect like if you're a child selling candies; never saw a graffiti disappears so fast in my life; and last, but not least, why is this game so DARK? and no options in the settings?

I would love to recommend your game, Mr. CLAUD10 50LANO (who back there in 2020 answered me gently on Steam), but there're things that breaks it to me, or angry me (or make my OCD and anxiety even worse).

I keep playing because I like the gameplay loop, but I would not purchase it again. They do not deserve that money.

It looks half finished. The game has three sectors, of which the second is half empty and the third one is a wasteland with a few buildings and props here and there. ALL the buildings except for your apartment and the mafia boss mansion are literally four walls and that's it. Everything feels empty, hollow, unfinished.

There are a few bugs which are not game-breaking, but they add to that feeling of being playing some kind of prototype, a beta or something, not a supposedly finished game.

Do not buy this game. The devs added a three quests and a new type of building and stated that was all, that is the whole 'Endgame' we are given.

I made a few guides to help with bugs and or mixing + sort of ""gameplay mode"" to make the game different.

But the devs and publisher don't even fix small gameplay bugs easy to fix, when they add new not great content that reduces fps... very questionable pratice (Stop thinking it's early and they are a small team, many other small teams actually work and think unlike dds team and publisher)

They continue to add new stuff, without even caring abour important broken mechanics UNBELEIVABLE.

[*]Has incredibly floaty mouse controls. Immediately went to forums. No clear fix and many people just saying ""deal with it lol, you get used to it""
[*]Tried recommendations of adjusting mouse DPI and lowering in-game sensitivity to 0. Nope.
[*]Worked out I could lower the resolution to fix it, but this made the in-game mouse cursor and OS cursor appear at different spots on the screen, making it really annoying to use the UI.
[*]While alt-tabbing to find fixes, game gets locked into windowed mode. Great.
[*]Decided to continue anyway. The game wasn't about to let me save yet anyhow, so I'm locked in to playing in a window until it does, I guess! Cool, guys!
[*]Got to the point where I needed to sell to someone. Couldn't break up what I had on me, and wasn't told by the game how to do this. Again to forums. Oh, workbench.
[*]The workbench. God. An incredibly unintuitive system with awful controls (only mousewheel to change menu selection, for instance). Couldn't figure out how to take anything off the workbench after 10 minutes, couldn't recombine packages ... and this time, [i]no[/i] help on forums. I can generally figure out obscure controls, being a programmer and an occasional Dwarf Fortress player, but this was just too janky to bother putting in the time to deal with. I assume if I continued I'd encounter equally terrible design decisions. Time to RQ and get a refund.

tl;dr: It's a really amateurish game with a lot of bugs, and I'm pretty sure the only reason people recommend it is because it lets them live out their Walter White fantasy.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Points to bruise on face.] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",1669938148,1669938148,True,74,34,0.809480428695678711,0,True,False,False

This game is good. Really good. Not only does it feel like a completed product, but it goes above and beyond what I expected. I expected a few hours of handing out drugs before it got boring. But the game delivers so much more. This is easily the best game with 'simulator' in the title that I've played, and possibly the best simulator game I've played.

Game is very accurate and on par with real life, except some aspects. For example, the pricing to get me started, is up to standards with IRL pricing as of 2022, some things could go up in price though. The crystal meth is too cheap. I really like the accuracy this game has with the drug cutting/mixing system, and all the cuts and mixes that you can make. It ia very realistic, but one thing that is off is how easily clients come in game. It should be more realistic with how hard it is to find/get clients, and how quickly/how they get attached to your product. Police is perfectly balanced.

edit:10/26/2022

I've given this game a few chances since it first released, and after (two?) years of updates I feel like it is still the same under-polished, over-promised little simulator game I was disappointed with before. I'm also seeing DDS2 on the steam market, which admittedly puts a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not seeing how releasing a sequel to an unfinished game makes any real sense.

Update:

The game is fun don't get me wrong, but the more successful you get, the more you work pretty much and there's not that much other than the extra cash you have to show for it. Can always buy interior stuff I guess, but there's a lot of wasted potential here for sure. I've heard that there's an end-game on it and that will be nice as now you just farm away without any other means than just stacking up those papers. 

I've had fun with the game, but chilling with 100k in my safe and have nothing to spend it on. I'll come back to it when the endgame update drops, other than that I hope DDS2 will have way more content on the spending side of things.

the second of all yes this game is fun, i basically ran through it all, although you're better off finding guides for drugs it's pretty easy to mix them yourself, and screw up massively, then giving the sugary meth viagra soda fentanyl stuff, so strangers would start dying. sometimes pretty scary but it's really fun if you get hooked, even if it's not finished yet it was really fun the whole time, as well as customizing your apartment, getting hundreds of g of drugs out to your own little pet-- i mean, dealers. yeah those mfs deal stuff for you. 
stuff i didn't like was how easy it was even on hardest difficulty kinda.. well that, or i am too good of a dealer while also having no end-game, a bug here and there,  nothing serious. but it was just a little bit too easy ( I basically wasn't really struggling, which I would've liked, this just makes me want to deal drugs irl) 
overall a great buy I'd say, even if you can get fucked over a lot, orrr you can just start killing everyone :)  mfs don't like your mix? go 50/50 with fentanyl, that should keep them from speaking up about it again.

It's a old build but still shows a good bit of the game.

Otherwise I love this game to bits, but their are a few glaring flaws the devs need to work on. 

First and foremost are the somewhat occasional bugs and a lack of program optiomization. Just today i had two bugs come up, one where i couldn't see the orders on the side bar while packing and another where i couldn't end a police chase because the cops bugged out. I solved both with a few simple things, first on for the sidebar i reloaded the game, with the police bug i just got the attention of some other officers and hid from them to end the chase. 

This game is really rather unoptiomized. When i play i shut down most every other program that i can running on my client. I'm running a bit of a older gaming computer but even doing this it can be a strain on the cpu. I have been able to stream this game but i had lag isues until i dusted out my computer. Fair enough. 

The game is imo kinda easy, want to expand quick? Don't get caught expand over the boarder quickly and make a deal with Gustavo to sell him coke. It can be straight from your cartel source and you'll be loaded in no time. It seems ultra hard mode dosen't do much besides reduce the patience of clients whos orders you say you'd fill and increase the number of orders you get which is paradoxical to hardmode because  you can sit months on a order without saying your filling it but the customer dosen't care. Imagine your weed dealer legit responded to your message 3 weeks after you sent it saying he's got you. Man i bought from someone else weeks ago...

You can litterly run from the cops into your main production house close the door in their face and they will give up chasing you and won't search the premesis. 

The game needs to scale jail cost, make reputation drop slower maybe do some other things to put up the skill level for me to be satisfied.  I'm a hardcore gamer that likes it tough but even hard mode is easy street to me.

Personly i play with a half maxed speed, stamina and no stealth along with putting my screen brightness down to zero (not in the game mind you it dosen't have a setting for that, rather my own monitor), The game is unusualy bright even at night. I preventing my self from running into a safe house for immediate protection and ruff it by hiding somewhere on the open map.

At max speed and stamina with a bit of crystal meth you can run like sonic the hedge hog for miles. If you max out your stealth the cops become near sighted. It only really gets hard to deal when the K9's come into play but the exposure factor raises too slowly even on the hardest difficulty and goes down too quickly to make that last long.

I'd also like a option to censor the nudity of the graffiti for streaming purposes. (reserve our rights and lefts ext, just nudity on twitch ext. isn't a great idea.)


Overall i like this game a ton, i have over 300 hours. Just some of the problems stop me from loving this game.


Tldr: If your looking to dink around and make a drug empire in an easy sandbox this is your game. If your looking for a challenge like me your gunna have to play altered modes and nuzlock yourself hard.",1657249081,1664743473,True,9,0,0.627016127109527588,0,True,False,False

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",1664283728,1664283728,True,7,3,0.512034416198730469,4,True,False,False

The night falls and Police Hour starts, the panel says ""Can't save game now"". I did not find the save button in the menu, and no autosave was triggered.

I exit the game eventually. Not surprisingly, the progress has not been saved. Frustrating, I do not intend to start a New Game again.

This is a game that is strictly enjoyable for the game play mechanics alone(buying, selling, growing, cutting, running, hiding). the story is minimal, god awful and with terrible voice acting (for the most part, with what little voice acting there actually is in the game) now if they would just release some modding resources and allow the community to add things to it such as new drugs/furniture/gangs/buildings etc.... through the steam workshop it could be even better. or maybe at least add 2 player co-op so it doesn't feel AS repetitive.   As of now, if you feel the game getting stale after playing it for so long all you can do is start over and put self limiting rules on yourself such as selling specific drugs only, or No client OD's.

     That Being said, the game is well worth the price  its available for i would definitely give this at least a 7/10, a little more polish or things i mentioned above and this could easily be a 10/10 for its price range.",1662127419,1662127419,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is basically a walking simulator where you sell drugs, the gameplay is quite addicting and quite fun. 
But there is soo much stuff missing. [spoiler]There could be tons more drugs like benzodiazepines , and combinations like candy flipping, but there are already tons of ""plotholes"": eg. If you mix fentanyl with meth, people should notice. Someone slipped LSD into your weed, well PEOPLE SHOULD NOTICE. Going into the apartment when chased by the police? No problem, the police will just run past. Also the weights are complete f*cked. ""LSD mix"" is in grams. Just sell it as blotters of 100ug and done. And even worse the fentanyl, because if someone would give an opioid addict 0.01g of fentanyl, they would straight up die, while in this game, you can have that much in a gram of something else with minimal side effects. Also in the game, heroin is also called ""china white"" which is basically a derivative of fentanyl. [/spoiler]
All this is just from the top of my head, I could dig deeper but not in a comment.

TL:DR: Fun basic gameplay but completely unfinished and plotholes everywhere.

They made it so people in VERY large areas will only buy certain drugs making other drugs inconvenient to sell since you can't sell them quickly without spending thousands of dollars for another house and equipment. Example, I was selling mainly amp until I unlocked cocaine which any sensible person would switch to for its cash gain but no, nobody will buy it except for people from up north which is inconvenient as fuck because 90% of my clients are not from the area I just unlocked some levels ago which slows down the pace even farther.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1628175782,1659816683,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,1,True,False,False

So, you're thinking about buying DDS, because you're somewhat interested in a good management game and have no shame for looking like a 15 year old to all your friends.

So, here's a short answer and a long answer for you:

[u] Short Answer [/u]

Don't. You'll be disappointed. Most of the people that play it, and still do, are.

[u] Long Answer [/u]

This game is the typical PlayWay game. What do I mean by this? Let me explain.

PlayWay's business model consists of, and has always consisted of ""Quantity over Quality."" You know those developers that spend years on top of years tweaking, playtesting and making their games better? Yeah, that's not PlayWay.

The way they went about DDS is the same way they go about any and all of their games:

- Trailer with empty promises, which are never delivered upon no matter how long you wait.

- Gets announced with 15 other Simulator games ranging from ""sounds fun"" to ""this is ridiculous."" 

- Abandoned after half a year of further development.

- Half-baked updates, when they do come out, that add nothing to the game whatsoever and probably got cut before release, ""fixed"" and re-implemented.

Like any of their games, this ends up in a loop of: ""Develop for one year, drop a demo, get complaints, fix some of them, ignore others, and out the door we go.""

Just look at the amount of announced games, there's so, so many of them. All developed by one company, and no matter how many sub-companies they create themselves to divert the attention from the ridiculous crunch their developers suffer, it's still the same company.

They saturate the market with half-baked garbage and expect your money, just wait until they find out about the Early Access System.


Now to the actual game, Thief Simulator, but with Drugs.

- Recipe Mixing has a right and wrong way, no inbetween. There's variations in the marginal grams that some people swear on, but it's all the same. Listed conveniently on their Discord.

- Stealth System is the same as in Thief Simulator, the Cops see you through walls and arbitrarily decide if they want to arrest you through a wall or not.

- Working at daytime is the same as working at nighttime, just without the scary music and you fill an arbitrary meter that ends up in a raid, which is the same as a game over, essentially, because the DEA takes all your stuff.

- They have an actual channel on their Discord for translations for the game by users, because they can't be bothered to do it themselves or hire someone that can speak English. Get used to gems such as: ""Trash Cupboad"", ""US dolas"" and my favorite ""Text Block"" which pops up everywhere they don't want to translate or haven't done so. This is me not including stuff such as ""noe"" instead of ""now"" and missing letters everywhere. There's people pretending that having NPCs spell every second word wrong gives the game a ""realistic feel."" Yes, this is how bad it's gotten.

- They promised guns, never delivered them. 

- They promised the player to be able to use drugs, didn't deliver.

That's just 2 examples, the list is long. Just look for the old game trailer on YT.

Drugs which alter the passage of game time, visual effects, and character movement speed can be frustrating when too intense.  
Sometimes one drugs' effects would functionally cancel out another drug's inconvenient effects.  Thus, the drug mixes I was after would manage (balance) side effects.

You deal drugs working your way up to getting your own dealers that you supply. Pretty simple right, wrong. To do this you gotta order from the cartel and still manage to make some extra cash after you sell to your clients. This is were cutting and mixing your Drugs come in. This can get complex, but is in my opinion is where the game shines. 
Cops are total A**e* in this game, it is great. Running from the cops is seriously intense the first time, and every time after still makes your heart pump a little.

The game does have some bugs that can be an issue at times and some polishing couldn't hurt. Updates to the game are a bit of an issue as they are slow to roll out and bugs tend to not get fixed. Despite this the game has a bit of a cult following and it is easy to see why.

previously i would have said buy this. BUT, i have given the game about 70hrs or so now. Its so stale. I had even taken a break for a week or two to see if it'd have the spark again. But, as soon as i loaded in and remembered where i was at, i checked the laptop for orders etc and everyone who could need/want something had requested a delivery. By the time you have sorted the orders and delivered, the dealers are asking to meet to give cash or people want more. i knew that it would be tedious so i didn't even continue. There so much more that could be added to this for incentive but it just isn't there. After i had discovered the phych drugs ""gang"" and the fat dude in the club i thought the game was going to change so you wouldn't have to do the running so much, that wasn't the case. Just more drugs at a shittier price than you get from your punters. So with that in mind, This is all you will do on this game, 

-check laptop
-confirm order
-weigh out product
-pick locks (they lock again when the day is over so you need a constant supply of bobby pins)
-take to dealer/client
-run from police
-search for your backpack you threw in a chase
-collect money
-buy ""nice"" furniture for your shitty house in the ghetto
-take money to eddie to pay mafia
-order more drugs
-pick up more drugs
-check the available property and not buy anything
-rinse and repeat

you can unlock more parts of town and apartments, however, once you have a strong dealer and client base on one side of town, unlocking more places makes everything even harder to manage when it comes to supply and demand. messing around with the checkpoints to get to other parts of town to deliver/collect and navigating in the sewers gets boring really fast. side quests are minimal and dry. The police aren't really a problem as you can save before you leave your hideout. Thus being caught means a reload and go again. Silly things make this game annoying once you've made some cash. Even once you are able to purchase your own growing seeds its yet another thing to try and squeeze into the constant annoyance of your phone/laptop going off for orders and keeping up supply and demand, even with your own dealers.  
the game works ok though, no crashes or anything like that. From what i have read is that the dev's are no longer really interested in this game and updates have dried up. Shame really as it does have so much potential. my original review is below, i did previously give this game a thumbs up. 

=====================================================================================

so much fun, 

does feel a little tedious at times however the drive for the ultimate drug lord status will keep you grinding. You can cut your drugs (i didnt do that once and it seems ive done ok) mainly as There isnt much information on what to cut them with but like i said i havent needed to.

Update: The text saying ""Hit [I] for work station manual"" stayed on the screen when I left the workstation.

Update: Serious glitch with gangs, they ask for 4 packages of 50 grams of coke, I bring the 4 packages of 50 grams of Granny's Ashes(see mixing guide on steam). I ask for a meeting yet they say I'm bad at math.

Edit: FINALLY got a good game going. Almost unlocked all the areas, but ran into the bug where I cannot interact with one of my dealers. Therefore missing some income. It's not game breaking BUT it's super annoying when you constantly have another icon on your map for someone that you cannot interact with, constantly throwing you off of where you need to go. I still recommend the game, it's given me hours of entertainment. This bug has been around since the release, so I don't know if it will be fixed but I HOPE it does. Doing some research, it seems this bug occurs when you are interacting with the dealer and get stopped by the police, which is exactly what happened to me. BE CAREFUL!

I will probably start another game since I didn't realize how early I could have unlocked psychedelics, but I really hope this doesn't happen again.",1656919434,1657430288,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just wish there were less of me having to run around too much in late game. I think an improvement would be managing drops and dealers instead of delivering everywhere all the time in late game. Also, watering indoor weed plants is required too often: it's tedious, and even difficult -- when they're near full growth.

Basically, after you get off the ground, there needs to be a way to delegate tasks, because in late game, I find that I am spread too thin to actually expand. One person can't do everything, and I'd like to relax and watch money come in from a system I've set up instead of constantly working more.

Also, after all the tasks are completed, there's no point in being rich. What do I need to buy? Nothing. The most appealing option at that point is starting over.

I am hoping for a good update to really make this an empire rather than just a one-person business where I spend every moment racing to satisfy clients and keep plants alive as more and more is demanded of me.

Those are my gripes, but I really enjoyed this game. It is a gem, even if it needs some reform, so to speak.",1657382864,1657383318,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

the problem: There isn't enough content to keep you going...   after about 10-15 hours of playing, you'll be at a point where you have everything unlocked (for the most part), and will be making so much cash you can't do anything with it.  
because there is only so much stuff to spend your money on.  buy a new small shed in each of the zones, and/or a small apartment. (I think that there are like 15-20 purchasable ""properties"" which isn't much in the scope of the game, as what you can do with your properties is extremely limited, specifically. you can buy your small apartment or shed, and then buy some of the few furniture items for it.   which essentially are: Cheap bed, couch, chair, table, etc.  Decent bed, couch, chair, table, etc. or Expensive bed, couch chair table etc.          as well as a few things like cabinets for storage, or a ""wardrobe"" that lets you ""change your clothes"" (Doesn't actually change how you look as you can't see your playermodel.)  or buy some paintings/decorative plants.

other than that for actual functional stuff you can buy, is where the game shines, you can buy various drug mixing/making equipment, ranging from cheap and inefficient ways of doing things like using an electric coffee grinder, a hand mortar and pestle.  all the way up to using high end lab grade equipment, such as: lab grade centrifuges, lab grade precision mixers, Flasks to break down drugs for mixing, to pill pressing machines to make your own pills. and so on.  

This aspect of the game is amazing and is done so well, in my opinion no other game does it better.   

the dealing itself is fairly fun, while avoiding police patrols, and trying to keep your ""suspicion"" or ""heat"" level down, all while trying to deliver the ""goods"" as fast as you can in order to keep your dealer rating as high as can be. (which in turn lets you charge higher prices for your ""goods"")

the game loop is repetitive, but very fun in itself.   the problem is, the game lacks any real ""content"" after you get to the point when you're selling to gangs in huge quantity. example,   some of the more expensive properties to buy are only like $4000  and you can make upwards of 20-30K when selling to gangs in bulk...  which means off of a few sales to gangs you can easily make enough cash to essentially be able to buy everything.   and then there isn't much reason to continue selling. 

This issue essentially is you just get into the ""good"" part of the game right around the time you unlock gangs,  (the ""good"" part of the game is when you get access to all of the ""merchandise"" to sell.  as all of the merchandise in the game is locked behind a level restriction.      so around the same time you finally unlock all the end game stuff, (H, Coke, Fentanyl,) and can start making these crazy mixes with the Fentanyl,  which is when the game really shines as you have to go through numerous steps in your lab to make a super drug.       you unlock the gangs, and that makes it so making your own super drugs is almost irrelevant.  because why should I waste my time making a super drug to sell and make a few thousand dollars over hours of work. when I can just bulk buy coke, or meth, and do a cheap cut, and sell it for 30K?)



So all in all, the game is amazing, it just doesn't have enough end game content, or reason to keep you playing.    

But the devs don't really care about the game, and barely put any work into updating it.


so far they push out a ""MAJOR UPDATE"" every year or so, and it adds a tiny bit of content. almost like they have one or 2 people working on DDS still, and the rest of the studio is working on other projects.     


but Movie Games S.A. and PlayWay S.A. are known to be scummy publishers who release unfinished products, hype them up, and get people to buy them, then run away with the cash. 

Unfortunately Byterunners ( the games devs) appear to have none, or almost no, active media presence... which means no way to tell how big of a company they are, or if they are a legitimate company. or if they're owned by MovieGames or Playway.

I just wish they could put a little bit more focus on this game, or try to force the publiser(s) they partnered with to help put some elbow grease into making this game better.

as if they did, I believe this game could be incredibly huge and popular.



I wish steam had a ""neutral"" option instead of having to choose positive or negative review.


I'd say buy the game if you think you like the concept of selling drugs in a game.     otherwise wait for a sale, until the devs actually add more content.

Then the repetition started showing once you join a gang, at that point the game is basically done. Unfortunately more cracks started showing shortly after reaching this point;

- There is literally nothing else to do. No bonuses, awards, advancements, nothing. Not even mini games besides simple lockpicking mechanics. Just larger increments of drugs to deliver.
- The lack of consistent updates (not including plugging their other games) really hurts especially when I would play for an hour then go in the sewers and have my frames drop to 12fps every time for months.
- No workshop option available to remedy the lack of updating or content. Having this option would definitely keep me coming back for more and enjoy the creativity of others

I totally understand a Ukrainian developers are having difficult times especially with the Russian aggression going on but this game has also been out long before this happened and I can count maybe four updates altogether since it came out, including small bug fixes.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead- murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time - something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange - uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" - on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",1655443200,1655443200,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

So game breaking glitch #1 the barriers by two towers, Cops can get stuck there and try to search you and if you run away it will still say he's trying to search you and it's stuck like that there isn't a way out of that unless you run into one of the cameras in the downtown area at night. You can literally walk up to cops and they will just question if they heard anything. Game breaking glitch number two, due to glitch number one my exposition got to the point where I got raided by the DEA so me being pissed off by my run through being pretty great to be ruined by the glitch i reloaded the game back to my starting point where everything was good just to see DEA Raid: 39 at the top of my screen and to put a cherry on top my dumb ass accidentally saved it. (I thought I was loading the save again. I was sleep deprived and not thinking) So now I am going to try to fix everything and hopefully get back on track. Anyways the pros to the game are: The game is highly addicting, the stealth, the chases, the strategy. I mean I literally just purchased this game and I've put 30 hours into it and I still have a long ways to go before I am finished. Sure you could say it's repetitive and that is fair but I like juggling my reputation between sectors and areas while trying to keep my exposition down and try to accommodate the things I personally want to do in the game. Like making 24 sales at night while trying to not get caught, depositing the money into laundering, setting up multiple buildings so I can operate anywhere I please, while also collecting dead drops to deposit to the fat fuck at the club, and taking care of my weed farm all in one day.

A year ago, the game just had zero purpouse, the only fun stuff was checking wether your clients had overdosed if you alterd the drug mix. The psychadelics gang was fun for a bit, but not my type of thing. But after the new updates (and I'm talking gameplay updates, not some hyped graphics/performance updates) I got pulled right into grinding this game again. The devs added a new sector, new shops, new passage ways (sewers + a hiden passage way that connects sector C and A), the new money laundering system is great and personally it is the thing that keeps me grinding the game since I've unlocked all drugs and hideouts. Also, new decorations like safes and posters are added (not much, but atleast you can splash some cash laying around). 
The other bit I need to comment since I've played the game on/off since it's release is the following: People who played this game for 20+ hours feel the need to criticise the devs because ""It doesn't look like it did in the trailer"" and ""We were promised much more"". I've got two repsonses for that sort of comments that unfortenately tank DDS's ratings. First off, the game costs 15€, so even if you don't like it, you can comfort yourself knowing that you didn't spend 50€+ like some people did with Cyber Punk and similar overhyped, underperforming games. 
Second, DDS gets updates that do take time, but the gameplay updates so far are pretty sweet (which motivates the player to grind the deals and collect cash). It will take time until the game ""looks like it did in the trailer"", but again; for 15€ I'd say it's a damn good deal. We've gotten 1/3 map expansion that also brought new clients and dealer, new shops, new passage ways, new hideouts, new characters, new additives, the new money laundering system and so on without paying any extra!
All in all, I can't reccomend this game to people who are clinged to the original trailer (if you realy want to know what the game is like before buying; watch some youtube gameplays because there's a lot of them now), however the game is perfect for grinding and becoming emerged in the world that the game takes place in.",1655031270,1655039154,True,1,0,0.482615053653717041,0,True,False,False

You might be behind your computer screen, like I once was, picturing yourself having a hell of a good time slinging dope, mixing dope and making ""beaucoup bucks"" in the process. You might argue that this game actually allows you to do it and, since I'm honest, I couldn't disagree with you. If you put enough time and energy in your playthrough, you might just achieve that. However, this comes at a cost: absolute frustration. Let me explain.

The architecture absolutely sucks. Last gen processors and this game are like a lactose intolerant person and a 10 gallon milk pail. Even if you get it to work, the optimization (if there's any to begin with) is so poor that you might as well run 3 AAA games on ultra, simulteanously. Stuttering and screen freezes will be your best pals during your gaming session.

The content itself is fun at first but quickly becomes repetitive. As someone whom enjoys the process, the first few hours of gameplay (leaving aside bugs and other nuisances) are great. You sling your stuff and try not to get tazed by the cops. You finally get out of mom's basement (aka the cartel's appartment) and get yourself a nice empty property that you fill with ""tools"" and furniture. Wonderful. However, as you make more and more money, two queen-sized issues appear: 1. What shall I buy next? 2. Welcome to monotonousness.

Many appartments are for sale but how many do you really need? Three sectors, three condos, basta. Now that you filled and decorated them, what will you spend your money on? A full blown casino chain to launder your money! Oh yeah, you are a ""partner"" in a multi-million casino chain but you still have to sell 2g of ""whatever you're selling"" to some guy whose name would make a polish scholar stutter and you still live in a ghetto that makes Ohio look like the Maldives. Anyways, what shall I buy next? A lab? A manager? Well, I got some bad news for you: nothing. You basically enter a vicious circle of: get money, put it in a dresser, order more, repeat. You get stuck. Let me give you a warm welcome into the marriage-breaking realm of monotonousness.

There is no endgame. You begin by working for cartel. Fast forward a bunch of sales, you reach level 20 and, depending on your play style, you will either work for: Pablo Escobar if diabetes wasn't a thing or Kiryu Kazuma with a serious substance abuse problem. Money used to be good when completing these transactions but now you basically deliever next to nothing and, of course, get paid less that a student working a summer job at McDonald's. Nothing more. You've reached the end of the story line.

""But dude, they release updates and it will develop further! You gotta wait, dude. Be patient, dude."". Yeah, and I'm the Queen of England. Each update has been heavily criticized as it tends to: reduce playability, ignore previous bugs and add new bugs. Also, don't expect to get news from the devs. If you see news on Steam, it'll probably read something like: ""Check out this new bundle."" or ""We are working hard on the next update, Anyways, check out this new bundle."". No updates, no fixes, not hotfixes, nada. This is the sad state of this game.

So there you go, my honnest opinion about this game. A game with an amazing potential that could've been something out of this world. Do whatever you want with this information but, if I may give you a piece of advice, spend your money elsewhere.

If you reached this last paragraph, I'd like to thank you for your time. I hope that you got some entertainment out of this review. My apologies for any typos. Have a good day and stay hydrated :)",1654469756,1654470897,False,10,1,0.610778450965881348,0,True,False,False

Watering plants, picking locks in the sewer or banging on a door for a while to drop cash to be laundered. Things you end up doing a lot but wish would go by faster.

Along with this a few other recommendation are:
-A very basic guide to mix the drugs while it is fun to find your own combinations looking in discord for hours trying to figure out the basic of the drugs take the immersion out of the game.
-fixing the gangs glitches they should order more not less along with new ""unlocking new features after 500 rep of gang"" there is nothing to unlock yet.
*on top of using dealers once they are maxed out they could handle an extra customer or two for you so your not constantly running around end game trying to keep all the rep up its like a stair case and once you reach the top it should be easier not harder much how the gangs handle the ""big fish part"" you  should be able to eventually.

Over all Byterunners studio gets a 8-10 it needs some polish and some extra content but once that happens I see this being a very big game similar to sims.

I have lost all hope for this game. All they do is LIE. LIE and LIE MORE. Don't Bother. Buy Rouge Legacy 2. A game thats actually worth it. 
TL:DR. Games an unfinished mess of a cash grab that should have been Early Access. The devs Byterunners Game Studio along with the publisher/s Movie Games S.A., PlayWay S.A. should be avoided entirely. We were promised the world and got nothing.
  
As much as I would love to recommend this game, No way in high Heaven or hell can I do so.
The game is absolutely bursting at the seems with potential, But sadly none of this will be realized or ever come to fruition.
This game for all intents and purposes should have been released in early access. 
Its runs poorly. Terrible optimization, No matter what pc I use I can't get it to run with any consistent amount of frames. Which is a shock considering the game isn't the prettiest thing to look at.
The bugs and glitches that are present are staggering! I've lost multiple save files for random reasons.
Now the major deal breaker, There is NO middle/end game content. No story. No meaningful progression what so ever. Nothing to spend your money on. (well a part from buying more drugs and things to cut and store drugs) It just turns into a running simulator after the first few hours. *Go to computer->Accept client->->Run.->Run some more->Keep running->Run even more->Rinse and repeat.*    
We were told that the devs had at least six months of funding and huge plans! Well its been five months and there have been less than a handful of updates. The only major one that lets the player ""Grow"" pot. (Which looks like they ripped it from a ps1 game the asset looks so bad).
The dev's have what seems to be gone into hiding. Releasing little to no information. 
When asked when we can see any sort of meaningful update we are met with ""Soon"" or ""Around the corner"" no matter how many weeks and months go by. Because of this a toxic community has formed around this game. A passionate but toxic community that like me see so much missed potential in this cash grab of a game. 
Do yourself a favor and don't buy this. Its as wide as the ocean but deep as a puddle. 
Don't support these dev's that don't care about releasing a game that is clearly in no way finished. That's not even mentioning the false advertising when this game came out.  
Don't support the publishers that are releasing a whole wave of garbage cash grab simulators. (Eg; Barn finders, Prison Simulator, Bum simulator. Just to name a few)
They brag about having 84 dev teams. All working on cash grab crap.",1599430534,1652166508,False,3,0,0.5062369704246521,0,True,False,False

Ok so i'll start off saying the game is fun in it's own way , i still feel like i'll be on a DEA / FBI watchlist for playing it and watching the crazy amount of YouTube videos to learn how to play it. LMAO 
But any-who , game works great , i've not ever had a single game crash yet. 

Good : 
- Fun game to pass the time. 
- I know know how to make drugs LOL 
- Graphics are solid 60+ FPS
- Music is ok , matches the game. 
- Walking/Running simulator 
- Stealth works alright. 


BAD : 
- Game has the feeling of a warzone. 
- Almost no one on the map. Train goes by a few times ever , almost never see people just wandering. 
- Cops are glitchy sometimes (Just random spawning)
- No Game guide or tutorial(s)
- Very very redundant.  nothing changes once you get high level. just grind and grind. 
- Game needs MORE content. (Bigger map , AI competition , More life to the map.)

UGLY : 
- There really is an issue with Police Searching you , Guy will check you , and then check you again a few feet down the road. 
- Game needs some sort of transportation. (Rollerblades , Skate board , a kick-Scooter) Something ! 


Game Needs/Ideas : 
- Game NEEDS a in-depth tutorial on how to mix items and why. 
- Game NEEDS a way to save a recipe you liked for kinda quick-craft. (Maybe have a notebook in-game and you can choose a recipe you liked - In doing that would highlight a text on screen of the recipe so you don't have to remember it.)  
- Would be nice to hire a trusted someone to work in your lab (Mixing stuff , packaging) 
- Game needs more 'Feel' to it. just feels like i'm trapped in a city that is nearly dead. 
- Game needs a way to Un-rent a property. 
- Would be nice to BUY a property . (I'm a person that likes to run out of one building)
- I wish there was a Building editor (Make it bigger , move walls , Cover windows) 

Closing : 
I bought this game on a sale so i got it cheap , and for what i payed , i feel i got my moneys worth 5-fold. 
I like it , it passed time and i learned some s**t along the way. 
Why should you buy it ?? well it is actually a fun game dispite how hard it is to learn about drugs and what-not. it's a mun Management/Sneaking around game. 

IS IT WORTH A BUY ?   YES 
Grab it on sale or at full price. it is a cheap game and it runs very well.",1652050027,1652050027,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

to be honest I did enjoy the few hours i spent in here, but you have to understand this is a project that is more or less a scam, they promised many updates that have not been accomplished and have gone as far as deleting the trailers that promised  such.

the game as it stands, does not have an ending or any meaningful story. there is many bugs including one thats plagued me since release...

The devs don't love this game at all and it's just a quick payday to them.. it shows...

I fyou don't mind the graphics, the game is really enjoyable. There is not much story as of right now but they are adding more stuff. the cutting mechanics is nice and the customers engine is great. I hope the new update brings some depth and more to it because the game goes a bit quick and when you get to lvl 25 you should have pretty much finished. Alot of potential, can't wait to see what's coming!

Update: This game still has potential but I feel like what the developpers are doing goes against what you have to do in the game to progress. I played this game for almost 150h now and managing the first sector and only the first gets really insane, you are able to make a ton of cash, get your customers addicted and level up your dealers. The level up system is sick and was really needed. But then you move on to other sector and they are just not worth it... You can make 11k in sector A per night or do 300$ in Sector B... And when you get to Sector C it's just too tricky to be worth it, Sector C is really nice and well made, I would be really happy if it would be worth the trouble when you get to it buy setting up a lab to do a 3g run is really bad. What I think would make the game better is either choosing where you want to start, addind difficulty with each sector or maybe having a kind of ''automatic managing'' as in you get a dealer high level enough so he can manage a part of a sector or a whole sector then you can focus on keeping him stocked, taking your money from the stash and then building up your next sectors. That would make the game so much worth and more enjoyable. I know you are trying to make a better game for us but right now I feel like we can't enjoy the way we deserve to.",1632008527,1651631661,True,2,0,0.525426626205444336,0,True,False,False

It has quite a lot of bugs aswell which are getting fixed slowly but surely, and hoping that the Dev team keeps working on it and especially add mod support :)

Just friendly disclaimer about this game: If you're looking to try this game out; I recommend downloading the free demo ""Free Sample"" so you get a feel for it and if your PC is good enough to run it smoothly or atleast pump out 30 FPS. Also, this game sadly has a very short story; which makes the game really repetitive at the end (about 10-20 hours depending on how fast you progress; and from player to another it might get boring if you don't mix your playstyle up a bit) where you just have to order cocaine, cut it, deliver, repeat. The game needs more depth to the story, more quality of life improvements (higher order limit for example, & making bins functional so we can dump unneeded items like the suit cases you get from the gangs) and mod support again ;)

All in all, I recommend the game.
2022: A new update's about to drop and it's looking good! Dope stuff
Update: The two suggestions I mentioned above (functional bins and higher order limit from eddie) were both implemented a while ago.

-When making drugs you can't see anything. For example, when mixing there is nothing in the pot. When putting liquid in a flask there is nothing in there as well. It's a hit to the immersion.
-No more reskins of drugs. Every single drug other than weed and ecstasy virtually has the same appearance. Very minor but it takes away from immersiveness.
-More things to buy. I appreciate having many avenues to move and make drugs, but it's all for nothing to get rich just to buy MORE drugs. No recreation or activities to spend this money on.
-The new money laundering system is also cool but it would be nice to SEE the business. Or be able to run a shop of some sort arouind town. Another avenue of minimal passive income that i can see.

And the dev that responded hasn't been active since June 2020. The game was released April 2020. You do the math about how involved the devs are.

At NO point in this game do you ever feel like a king pin and have people selling drugs for you or helping you make money. There is no Coop mode at all.

I understand it is suppose to be hard to move forward. But when you make a trade with a main boss kej for 440g of meth and you made $800 total dollars something is f'ing broken. Then you take that whopping $800 and you launder it for a total profit of $320. So working to get to that boss makes me no more than the deals with the street morons in 25 minutes, but took over an hour.

I am sorry what drug dealer is going to spend  hours of his time and risk to make $320 when a table or chair costs $500, complete broken payout system.

It's good, I do recommend it, there's no endgame though, you reach a point where you have so much money just from working with the gang there's nothing left to do. Why would I run from one side of the map to the other to sell 40g. When I can sell 2.5kg.

There's also a serious flaw with the mixing, if you want to mix large quantities, good luck, by the time you're mixing 1kg batches there's not enough mixing material available from the shop. The gang are asking for increasing quantities each day, I'm currently at 2.5kg. I can not get enough mixing material to make this much so I just sell them the pure stuff. Would be nice to be able to keep on mixing at this point.

Update on 04/04/22: 

It's better, the gang doesn't request ridiculous amounts anymore and the dealers that work for you request more than 40g now. You're now able to buy as much mixing materials as you like and not a set amount each day. You can travel through the sewers in a much more involved way to get to the other side of the map, the map has been expanded and new zones have been added.",1619979995,1649104622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

oh, oh i was so wrong.

while yes, this is certainly a sh!tty unity dump game, the amount of content there is to offer actually blows me away. in my first and current playthrough, im currently at level 30 sitting on 15 grand in cash underneath of my bed in the oldtown warehouse that i owe to the cartel, meanwhile i've lined the garages around me up with drug stashes and weed growing operations. i've easily got a few hundred grams of just about every drug sitting in jars across my apartment, garages, and warehouse, and i feel like i've barely even scratched the surface as i'm now helping a psychadelics gang hunt down a rat in sector B.

i really hope the devs don't abandon this game. there's so much to offer here and i have really no complaints at all. for a game you'd expect to be riddled with bugs and unplayable errors, i've come in to 0 problems over my current 11 hours of gameplay and nearly 2 weeks in game.

devs, PLEASE keep up the great work and continue pushing out more content for this game, i can't wait to see what the future holds for drug dealer simulator",1648044218,1648044218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Come up with a real update to 'update' us with. Also, the most fake support post you could possibly summon. I entirely regret supporting this dev team. You are trying to benefit off a war!

Ideas for the future:
- On Shady Comm, Order the Users/Dealers by the area they are in  (Ex. Sector A first, Sector B Second, Sector C Third)
- Or allow custom ordering of the Users/Dealers
- Make it possible to do Drop offs to your dealers in Trash Cans and Such
- Or make it so you can have 1 or more Top Distributor(s) per Sector that gives the orders to the Dealers, and collects the money from them (Send you the Request, Requiring 1 Day to give out, 1 Day to collect, 1 day Request you to collect the money they have, and Sends the next order the next day)
- Make it so one of the Casinos you own are in the town so you can gamble
- Make Hideouts that are more open (just one big room)
- When buying items that get deliver to your hideouts, allow players to select multiple hideouts (Ex. you buy 2 computers, you can select 2 hideouts that each gets one of them)
- Create a Club or something similar that you can buy in a Sector that allows you to do Multiple Big orders with cool down (Ex. 500g+ orders, 3-5 day cool down each)
- Remove the ""Collect Money"" Tasks pop ups when on the Work Tables, and Show more orders on the side
- Add a drug reference table somewhere for people that do not know the terms for all drugs
- Perhaps add an option to bribe the police
- CHANGE THE GATES SYSTEMS. Should not require you to unlock it every time you go to use it.
- The backpack update they did was terrible, change it back to a max weight, not slots.

Just a side thing, i have Shad coins, like physical coins that are in my cabinets that i don't know what to do with it, i don't remember how i got it, but i don't know what I am supposed to do with it.

Although I wouldn't recommend it because the early access really begins to show between mid to late game, its very buggy and in places you don't want bugs,progression begins to stagnate and become horribly repetitive, and this is a ""Drug Running Simulator"" with a big emphasise on the ""RUNNING"", i cant get the time back i spent in this game but hopefully this post will save yours.

The bugs that killed the experience for me:
Some orders don't appear on the taskbar until you meet up with the client who ordered them making you do double the running for nothing.

La Ballena wont send orders through until i save and restart the game.

One of my dealers has become a street ornament and wont interact at all just stuck in the same place and withholding a lump some of money from me.

Sometimes during searches or before they start police will randomly aggro even whilst im standing still which turns into a loop of non stop tasers, where i wake up at the police station and the police are still aggro and taser me again. :/",1646655151,1646655151,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Bugs, it happens often but its something that can be avoided. Mostly happens if you are unlucky and it rarely happens. Examples? When it said ""Cop Search"", and you escape early it still shows it. Not only that, but eventually the cops will ignore you and you cant go in the safe house because ""Cop Search"", breaking the game and forcing you to restart to your previous file. Thats one of them thats rare.

Story: At first when you play this game, it feels like theres a story behind it. Making the game more interesting further. Then as you go through the past hours, you realize later theres no actual ending in this game. Its endlessly selling drugs. Whether the devs left this intentionally since due to being a simulator game or left some stuff unfinished I dont know.

Gameplay: At first, its really fun. A little odd because no guns or even cops shooting at you which instead they use tasers on you if close enough. But as time passes, it gets boring. As of this review, I am lvl 70. Maxed out my stats, and took over almost every city. Some were impossible for me because of certain reasons which I hope in the future developers would look into. I wont spoil it. Also, it gets tiring to run around the city handing out drugs constantly, even when you are a successful drug dealer.

Aside from these flaws, its an experience and enjoyed it. I would still recommend it, because this game is very reliable when it comes to killing time as well thanks to making the game endless. In case if you dont anything better to do. But on a personal note, it also feels like the game is unfinished.

The bugs are minimal so far and the biggest complaint I have at this point is that the lab where you store, organize and craft your product is difficult to manage.

☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

The graphics are good. They didn't play a huge role in whether or not I liked the game though. 

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

This is the big thing for me. The gameplay is honestly fun. What it is essentially is, order drugs, get drugs, be in debt, sell drugs, pay debt, and then the rest of the money is profit. Eventually, you get dealers to help distribution. You can eventually buy another house. When I bought a new house, I used it to grow weed to maximize my profits. The game can feel a bit clunky at times, but its very easy to adapt to it. There is no story really. The story is essentially guidance, then you basically sell drugs and just make as much money as you can. There is a time where you meet a gang, and have to help find a snitch, but that's it really. The world is dull and boring. The NPC's are boring as well. But for $8, it is easy to look past.

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

The audio is audio. It isn't crazy. There isn't much voice acting, but it isn't bad. It sounds, ""edgy,"" but its easy to look past. 

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☐ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

This game has drugs, and you can cause people to get addicted to drugs. There is apparently overdosing addicts as well. I haven't done this yet. This is definitely for adults. 

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

My setup is a Ryzen 2600 with a Nvidia 1080ti FE and 16 gb of ram. I experienced no lag at 1440p and max settings. I could see this game running fine on most PC's.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☑ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

This game is very easy, the controls and functions take some getting used to, but it is very much so easy. 

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☑ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

The game itself is a grinding game. That is all it really is. You essentially just play to see how much money you can make selling drugs. 

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☑ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

As I said before, not much of a story. More of a grinding game!

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☑ Average
☐ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

I would say, this game is as long as you want it to be. I still play it even though I've finished almost all the missions. I only have $2,000 in my bank account, and plan to stop once I hit 1 million. 

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☐ Worth the price
☑ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

6/10, Fun game, boring world, but some mindless fun. I personally enjoyed it very much. If you like simulation games, I think you'll enjoy it.",1645302760,1645746698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
682990,110900826,76561198087895719,0,16,10101,0,7752,1674499293,"Unfortunately this game has done nothing but backslide since release.  Rather than add to the game play and depth of the game.  They have made the game more and more irritating and tiresome to play.   The best thing they did was add the ability to grow weed, except they added it at a point where most players don't bother with weed any more.

The map changes they made, made the game considerably less fun to play and much easier for the cops to catch you (in a game where the police already cheat like crazy, clip through walls and run at supersonic speed). Also why the locked gates everywhere that automatically re-lock in a few minutes.  Particularly as most of these gates would be even easier to climb than the fences.  They just closed the downtown off with them and turned it into a nightmare to navigate, especially while being chased by the police.  

Everyone sick of the generic lock-picking mini game that every sandbox game seems to need now.  All it does is add even more pointless busywork, and frustration when that gate you unlocked 5 minutes ago is locked again! 

Then they added the sewers upgrade, a good upgrade if it wasn't a crazy maze filled to the brim with more of these damnable self relocking locked gates. Seriously ENOUGH WITH THE DAMNED SELF LOCKING GATES! I should have to unlock them at most once a week preferably only once ever!  Not over and over and over and over, using the sad tired overused lockpicking minigame. To the point I just ignore them all, and the sewers too. 


Then came this new latest patch, which for me has just ruined this game.  They added a new area, great!, except it is locked up tight for some reason... ok, and you need keys... that can only be used x number of times..?!!  Seriously why do the keys magically run out of uses? Are they made out of crumbly metal and wear out? Is this a good game mechanic that make sense and help with immersion? NO it isn't, it is pointless busy work and a money sink.

Second they decreased the amount of time in a day, when there was already not enough time to get things done in the night. They did at least fix the completely broken reputation system so it doesnt instantly drain like it use to. Which is good at least.

Police heat now seems to be broken, I use to be able to deal unnoticed by dealing at night, now I find police cars and my heat way up doing the same thing.

They also made some changes to dealing where certain areas prefer certain drugs, and certain clients want certain drugs. The wealthier areas prefer the expensive drugs, the poorer the cheaper. Problem is, this is not how it works in the real world at all.  The two most expensive drugs in the game, cocaine and heroin are the most in demand drugs in the poorest areas of the american inner cities. Crack cocaine is an epedimic, and heroin is litterally everywhere, as are most of the other drugs. These changes are not how it works in the real world and the old system was in many ways better.

The most agravating changes were to the inventory. We are now tied to slots in backpacks etc, that can hold up to 20g each and yet keys (1kg) somehow too. this means when you make a 100 gram batch of your favorite drug, and break it down into the most common 1g and 2g varieties, you will have dozens of 10-20 packs in your backpack, and each backpack size can only hold so many packs. Which makes sorting through inventory to get deals ready pure torture, especially with the new time pressures.

You can't even trim back to 2 types of drugs any more because each client wants what they want, which leads to many identical bags holding vast little piles of drugs.

So ya, this game is in even worse shape than when it released. And the changes have taken away almost anything that made this game fun.


Anyways these are my suggestions to the developers to fix this game before it gets even more worse.

1. Fix the inventory system. A small backpack can easily hold 1-2kg of drugs, even if you broke it all down to 1 gram bags it can still easily hold 1-2kg of drugs. So drop the stack limits entirely please. 1 stack per weight type, per drug.

2. Either get rid of the locked fences and gates, or make it so you need to unlock them once every week, or once period. The lockpicking minigame is an overused mechanic and adds little to the game.

3. Make it a bit easier to escape the cops. The point of the game is to have a good chance of getting away. The cops should have stamina like we do, and run at reasonable speed, and stop being unexahustable terminators.

4. The keys for the new area should not have limited uses. Try coming up with a better mechanic, like maybe passcodes or bribery

5. We need ways of managing clients, ways to group them by district, ways remove them

6. I suggest making the drug drops only happen in the south part of the city. This is where the cartel we belong to lives, and it would add the challenge of having to move drugs from our area to the rest of the city.

7. We should not get heat at night unless chased by police, or arrested with drugs on us.

Giving it the thumbs up because I enjoyed my time with it but just be aware that this game will be a grind, and doesn't really have an ending. Below are my thumbs ups and grievances, which won't make sense unless you've played.

Where the game works (early-mid game):
-Running one-off deals with clients and mid-sized deals with your dealers, dodging the police
-Leveling up your reputation and expanding your lineup of products, upping prices
-Smuggling drugs across into Sector B of the map, which has a few different methods and all have their uses
-Using a knockoff Discord for keeping track of deals is fun, and I enjoy making the dead-drop runs

Where the game breaks down (late game):
-The quests and progression grind to a halt - the quests involving certain gangs feel half baked at best, incomplete at worst
-Reputation becomes meaningless after unlocking all zones because there's too many districts to maintain for no benefit
-Sector C is blatantly not finished
-The scale and frequency of orders grows to such a stupid level that it no longer makes sense for you to be responsible for pushing 400g of cocaine daily for a massive gang, supplying 10 dealers with drugs, and also still serving individual people when they message you
-Growing weed and mixing drugs is fun but serves basically no purpose other than scraping a bit more money, which serves no real purpose anyway, other than buying useless properties

Feel like they committed way too much time to the Growing / Mixing part of the game and not enough on having you run the business side of your operation. Having to manage your dealers (what they sell and where, scheduling them to avoid suspicion, having them help with growing/mixing efforts) and pushing large amounts of drugs to the city should be the late-game, not running around like you're the town's drug mule. 

As it stands, the late-game is the exact same as the start but 10x the customers, 10x the quantity, and way more hassle running around constantly for no further benefit. Doesn't exactly make you feel like you've conquered the drug dealing world!

#2 comment - 15 hours Also now so far still no Good updates. Actually the only update they introduced took away what was good and made it more a pain in the ass. Where are the BIG UPDATE'S ? Let the modd's make this game fun please. so far i don't think you know what we want. 

House's are shit with also shit lighting inside of them... atleast fix that will ya. i hate having to squint in a dark room and even more in a video game. or leave it to a mod.

And don't watch the trailer of the game. you can't do anything from what the trailer show's us.  Should of called it walking simulator, hell i think that might be even better.

It has very tight and satisfying gameplay loops, the game mechanics are fun and satisfying, though sometimes lacking polish. and there is a surprisingly large amount of content to progress through, and you have alot of flexibility in when and how you progress. some of the things you can do: 

- you can cut and mix drugs to boost their profitability, or to increase or decrease how addictive and/or dangerous they are.
- customers can actually OD and die, which affects your reputation. there is alot of thought put into the different drugs and how addictive / profitable / dangerous they are.
- different customers have different 'quality' expectations, customers can get addicted which adds some interesting changes
- you can work with gangs, moving big quantities of product, same gameplay loop as regular selling but done in a different way.
- money is implemented in a fairly sophisticated and interesting way: you can only use cash for certain things, for many important things you need to use your bank account but depositing too much money is risky, so there's a whole money laundering system.
- you can rent properties all over the map, which provide bonuses and act as safe houses, and buy and place furniture and equipment in them.
- you can grow weed lol

My computer meets the recommended settings but my computer for some reason still can't run it, even after setting the graphics to the lowest and changing the ""gameusersettings"" file to 0 in the %appdata%/local file. It doesn't matter if I have nothing but the game and steam open, it still runs like complete fucking trash.

Bear with me - making a grindy and repetitive game that is coincidentally fun is possible (I am looking at you, the entire MonHun franchise). 
But these devs have failed at it. Whatever content they add only serves as a decoration to the lack of story and depth of progression, and fun in this game. 
Real life criminals and Drug Lords like Pablo Escobar will not run around themselves just to deliver 2g of stuff to a druggie 5 miles away. So shouldn't you, because you eventually become so large that you should bother yourself with management, and bribing the authorities, and not with doing small orders.
This game has you hire dealers - clients that order more and redistribute your dope. How about instead of them doing fictive, non-existent clients, you can assign your real clients to these dealiers by drag and dropping them?
As a virtual drug lord, I want to bother with management, with luxury, and with progression - and not with doing the exact same thing over and over again, only in slightly varying scenarios.
And did I forget to mention - the trailer that the devs had for this game is entirely different from what we have in the end. Am I saying that this is bad? No. Between the production of the trailer and the final game, things can change. But lets face it - with the various UI elements, the trailer wanted to present itself as legit gameplay - but was not the gameplay that we got.
The NPC animations are lame, the story is nonexistent after level 20. The game still has game breaking bugs, which have not been fixed. How hard is it to fix a couple of typos in the game? Definetely a lot easier than spending time adding things literally no one has asked for.

This game is fun as a timekiller, but do not expect to feel yourself like a drug lord, since you are literally dependent on one character to keep your business going (Eddie)",1607772281,1644594620,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Big update that adds more areas and content, overhaul on the dealers and large gang order. Good for the most part. You actually have some late game stuff to do now, being nearly absent once you started making huge deliveries to the gangs. Those have been drastically scaled back and not making 10s or 100s of thousands at one go. 

There's plenty of bugs and issues around, but the bottom line is that it's still worth the price for the entertainment that's there. Plus they are actually putting out decent free content for what is now a 2 year old relatively low budget game. So for asking price or on sale well worth it.

I've got a bit of a mixed review. I'm recommending because I think that for the amount of money this game costs, I've already gotten my money's worth. 60 hours is more than most AAA single player games, so for less than $20, it's a deal. It is entertaining. 

On the flip side, once you've hit the mid game and have made several gang drug deliveries, it starts to get stale. A lot of the drug mixing complexity is wasted, because once you have a decent mix, you just replicate that. The gang deliveries are worse in this respect, since there's no addiction mechanic, I just mix it to the lowest acceptable percentage with the cheapest additive. 

It would be great if there was a mid to late game management aspect. It seems pointless and can be frustrating to continue making 2-5 gram deliveries as a street level dealer just to maintain respect levels when you're already making hugely profitable gang deliveries. There's not a drug dealer or businessman alive that would continue wasting time on $20 transactions when they're making five to six figure transactions almost daily. It would be much more rewarding to pass off the small customers to a network of dealers that handle everything, but you have to make sure they're supplied and not getting busted or ratting on you when they're unhappy. Add some depth to the dealers. Maybe they specialize in a certain drug, maybe they're skimming money, maybe they're a police informant, etc. 

Lot's of room to grow, since the core gameplay is solid. A sequel or large DLC with deeper mechanics and the ability to leave the small stuff behind would be great.",1591316634,1644524352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

very fun game, and you can do allot of different things.
I have started over again 2 times, and its still fun. when I start over, I can do many things differently forexample, selling other drugs, mix new drugs, buy my first hideout somewhere else, get different dealers 
and more!

I really would recommend this game :)

in further updates I would love to have:
different drug packages, because they all look the same, even the LSD, DMT and shrooms packages. kinda boring
More guys like gustavo, and a more in depth experience in the gang reputation system. if that makes sense.

With dealing comes money, and with money comes getting new hideouts to grow and produce in.

It's fun, it's a bit of a thrill being chased by the police while carrying all kinds of shit cause you feel confident in your drug dealing capabilities.

Sneaking around all the time avoiding patrols, making money, the creativeness from making your own recipes. A lot of fun. However. There is no endgame. There are no new features, even when the quest reward says so. The end game is repeating what you've done, but with bigger numbers. There are no new things to buy, there are no new drugs to get or mixers to try out. There are so many things that would help this game, but frankly it's been too long. It feels forgotten even though some people swear its not. It's still super buggy; even having been out for this long. It took me 3 different game saves to manage to progress without my save being unplayable due to some bug. After finally getting the game to work as intended; I found it relatively easy to make money and progress, which of course is fine, it just takes time. But the biggest problem is there is no big reveal. There is no breaking the ceiling. There is no better equipment, or new map, or new people. There's just the game as it is. If it ever gets updated - Worth a play. But as it is right now in its current state - it's simply not worth putting time or commitment into.

Revised -----

After the new update, it's obvious the Devs put a lot of thought into what to add, and they listened to the players. The increase of objects to buy and the customizable options in the apartment were greatly desired.  As well as adding difficulty to the game by making the changes they did, increases the replayability and brings some interest to the gameplay.

Main gameplay is basically sorting drugs into smaller bags to be ready to quickly grab the correct amount also you can cut them with household products to get more money. As your sell more to your customers them become your dealers, meaning you give them drugs first then they give you the pay a bit later. You also manage your stock of drugs and your own debts. Avoiding cops for random searches. Buying new properties are underwhelming, most interiors are very akward to arrange furniture in and very weirdly shaped, lighting also sucks. End game feels lacking.

That is basically the game theres not much too it.  Hope to see more gameplay in future updates.

I don't understand how one could have such a ""f you"" attitude in game and then proceed to literally ignore their own updates. I think the most upsetting part is the way their posts about future content is formatted. Originally they said nothing about any updates ever and received a large amount of backlash(I very much did not agree with the hate) Now they just tease each and every little meaningless detail that is damn near irrelevant to the consumer in attempts to appease those original complaints about the silence. Again treating us like idiot babies.

To start off, I would say there is some playability in this game and you can get your money's worth if you wanted to role play as a drug dealer for a little while. The problem is though that after you get used to the gameplay loops, there really isn't much to offer in terms off story/end game products, you're just dealing drugs just to deal, no real rewards to compliment the work you put in, which is unfortunate because there def is a solid foundation to this game.

Pros:
-Solid gameplay loops

-Good time waster

-Nice challenge that encourages different methods of play

Cons: 
-I think it's still in early access with no clear timeline on when/if it will ever be finished

-The updates progessively make the game more unstable/unplayable (I stopped playing after they took out a control option without bringing it back after mentioning it to a developer over a year ago)

-Little incentive to continue on after unlocking all the drugs

-A.I can be a little wonky


While I do hope the Devs can turn this project around, I think there's not much left to offer with this game and would only recommend if you wanted to try something new and you have a disposable income. Otherwise, pass.

i cant tell you have many times i have started a new game and then just stoped playing right around you get acces to heroin cause by then there just isnt anything new or fun to progress towards.

Considering that the game was released late 2019 and it still looks unfinised (no mather what the devs say)
there still isnt any end game execpt more of the same grind

And i just found the offical trailer for the game, Thank god i didnt se that before i bought the game or i woud have been furious. now it just kinda sucks that we didnt get that game cause that seems a whole lote more fun and interesting

And finaly, to anyone who still think that the devs didnt lie, i can easily prove it. 
this is whats beeing said on the ""front page"" of the game

Who needs money, if you can't spend it, right? Use your profits to either grow your gang, buy new equipment, hire some muscle or... JUST HAVE FUN AND PARTY

You CANT grow your gang cause you dont have one, you just join one.
You CANT hire some muscle, not that there is any need for it in this version of the game
You CANT party. You can try the diffrent kinds of drugs but if you consider that a party, you got some bigger problems 

You Can however use your money to buy new equpment so thats something.. i guess.

If the Devs just woud fix the game, and maybe take a hard long look at their mods for the disc channel then this coud be a really great and fun game but until then, i will advies all of my freinds not to buy",1642606664,1642606664,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

After 12 hours, I had an issue, and I went to read that it's an issue that hasn't been fixed since its acknowledgment over a year ago.  The issue is, once you purchase an additional facility like an apartment or warehouse, and you purchase furniture and all the shabang that goes with....these things may ""disappear"" for no apparent reason (such as a raid).  A chunk of my 12 hour time went to raising the funds to purchase minimal equipment to get the 2nd safehouse up and running only to have the entire room and the lab contents purchased for it (not even placed onto a workstation) gone....all but the secret floor/wall panel, which had nothing in it to begin with.  I had a good bit of fun running around and playing this title.  I feel gut-punched to know that I can't, in good faith, continue playing knowing chunks of my progress can just disappear and this issue hasn't been resolved by the developer.  They must've cashed in on massive amounts of real drugs and well....they're like gone, man!  Fuckin' gone!

Update:  I probably should've done more research on how this game was advertised when released and what occurred the weeks after.  I feel like most of the positive reviews come from library collectors that gave this title a few good hours and called it great and moved on to the next flavor of the list.

While it's fun as a ""bored enough to play""game,  my issue comes with the lack of communication and talk from devs. At this point they are developing a new game and I can only guess it's going to have the same issues as this, very basic, very straight forward, and content starved release.Is the game fun? 100% yes. Is it worth $20? absolutely not. for a very unpolished game that is only now having its graphics worked on without any talk of more content releases, I can highly recommend other games to play out of boredom.Overall 4/10

Edit: Devs lack of communication on steam is due to their main form of updates being on discord, where the admin Odda called most steam reviewers ""cry babies"" and to ""wait a bit longer"" This is enough for me to say I can not recommend the company and their future games in general, as of the lack of professional behavior.

Update: Since this initial review, nothing has been added to further the game's story or features that they have promised since launch. SA and BR made this game as a cashgrab, do not buy this game and be more than cautious for their future releases.

Last update: Still no update, but there is another game on the steam wishlish thats really similar to this style of game and is worth checking out instead. its just growing instead of dealer, so check it out for actual communication and a reliable dev base.",1600219636,1641801931,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is literally no endgame, no story, no depth to the characters, nothing to do with your money, no reason to expand. There is no combat, no real rivals, no real competition -- no real conflict. The hours I spent on DDS are hours spent as a rabbit on a treadmill chasing a carrot.

The base game that they gave us, rather than the one they promised, can be entertaining but there are 3 main reasons I'm leaving a negative review:

1) devs sold a lie with the initial trailer and decided to include almost none of it in the actual game
2) devs do not understand the importance of communication, and every attempt at appeasing the community is half-baked and feels like theatre
3) devs will not add, or even address why they won't add, a workshop so the community could actually turn this game into something worth sticking to.

The ""company"" producing this game has endlessly neglected this title and has falsely advertised promises they did not keep. Just look at the comments on their ""community"" posts and you will understand the general census of how people feel how this developer. This is purely an asset flip, taking premade assets, making false promises and taking as much money as possible then ditching the game completely. These devs wholeheartedly do NOT deserve your hard earned money, please spend it elsewhere and save yourself the disappointment.

The good: 
I'm only 14 hours in but I managed to hit level 15, a goal we all wish to get to for that sweet sweet ganja growing. Anyways, the game is pretty damn solid. Good mechanics, a nice amount of frustrating, just enough to keep you wanting to flip more packs like the real g you are. I can endlessly flip drugs of my choice with nothing forced upon me, the freedom is truly fun. Whipping up some amphetamine and drying your big bags of weed as you grow your empire, what more is there to love? The voice acting is pretty fresh and the accuracy is much enjoyed. It takes some time to get the hang of the best ways to do things, but once you do you're running around constantly with a plan that could change at any given moment. The system of heat works well and I love having to tone it down and not supply anyone but my closest dealers in order to avoid heat but still keep the income rolling in, a thoroughly realistic experience.

The bad:
The game is however lacking in some areas. The map is fairly confined and in one 8 hour sitting I had unlocked the whole area. There's no use of vehicles or at minimum a peddle bike, meaning you HAVE to run everywhere and so does everyone else. The idea we're locked in by the government with constant unrealistic checkpoints can eventually get quite dull and feels like an excuse to do less work, since we already know how big game worlds can be in 2020. In my opinion, multiplayer in this game would be a breathe of fresh air in many ways, given that there would be a bigger world to accompany it and things like vehicles in order to really feel like I can flex my big cash gains. A server-based multiplayer (where only one player can claim a property, other players can band up or be rivals etc. and everything saves on the server) or co-op mode with saves would be great and really give us some greater goal. I thoroughly enjoy the messaging app, but it seriously needs to work on the phone rather than just the laptop, role-playing as a drug dealer who doesn't really use his phone is a bit... naff. 

In conclusion, the core mechanics are really sick. There isn't another game quite like it and it can feel fairly addictive at times. This game is essentially what GTA V is missing, but then it's also missing a vast open world like GTA V. Quite a frustrating reality from someone who was so ready to properly slang drugs in the GTA Online world just to be horribly disappointed by Rockstar Games. I just really need a way to flex my money, starting out walking and buying better and better transport as I go along. Being able to visit other cities and not live in a dystopian universe where there are walls surrounding the city and the ability to really experience the high life and get out of the ghetto. So that's it, all this game lacks is a sense of accomplishment and a big open world to explore.",1593036163,1641688645,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That being said, DDS is an addicting (no pun intended) and brilliantly designed resource management sim with an elegantly simple and plainly fun stealth system.  One of my favorite elements of the game is a great example of some of its most engaging qualities. Being outside at night will get you arrested, if you get caught, but clients pay you more for delivering during those hours. This presents an optional challenge to the player that is not only extremely rewarding, but also forces you to engage with one of the strongest design elements the game has to offer; the map. 

Police patrols become mostly predictable a few hours into the game if you are making note of where you see them most often. However, the patrols adapt to where you are most active during the day, effectively zeoring in on areas where you have some of your most accessible clients early in the game. This will force you to think on your feet when making a delivery and running into an unexpected patrol, forcing you to find other routes to stay punctual, which is something your clients make note of. 

Your knowledge of the different twists, turns, nooks and crannies of the map will expand as your reach across it does. There are several unlockable hideouts across the game which can serve basically as a drug lab or storage space, but you are also (effectively) safe from police inside of them, which can also come in handy if you find yourself running from them, which will also put your map knowledge to the test. 

This game is far from perfect, but it has some incredible and practical ideas that really make it easy to look past its minor flaws that have a particular indie-studio-charm. The game is still regularly receiving support from the devs and I'm excited to see how it grows and evolves. It has so much untapped potential and it stands to be an even better and more fun game than it already is, which is honestly just fantastic. This game is easily worth double what it's listed for on Steam.

Why is it even raining in the tunnels?  I really like the concept and the gameplay but it's rough around the edges.  Here's some areas I think you should improve:

- Disable rain in the tunnels (and generally optimize this game for minimal graphics settings).
- Improve the awkwardness of the drug interaction/bagging process.  It's okay to have more than one hotkey (e) to use to interact with objects in the game.  A very simple improvement would be to allow users to hit ""enter"" on their keyboard instead of having to manually drag and click the mouse on the ""confirm"" button when the game asks you how many grams of something you want to transfer, but I think you can do so much more here.  The entire workbench interaction thing is totally unintuitive.
- Allow us to move furniture between outposts
- Give us something satisfying to spend our money on - gambling, clubs, collectibles, upgrades, moving out of this rundown city, a mansion, etc.
- Consider balance changes to the respect and sales mechanics.  I'm pretty late game with all areas unlocked, and it just feels like a chore getting everyone drugs and trying to prevent respect from dropping -- additionally, there is no way to get bonuses in certain areas, like Bad Asia.

Again, I do like this game, but for $20 I would expect more polish.

This game massively improves when bought half-priced.

---
Surprisingly addictive and with more depth than I expected. The base mechanics are stealthy fetch quests, a neighbourhood reputation system, drug design and lab (base) building. The map is large, keeps some secrets and allows traversal progression by picking locks, unlocking areas and finding alternative routes. Regarding drugs, how you mix them results on losing clients over time, turning them into addicts or their death. There's also a money laundering system to allow you acquire property (spaces and equipment).

The worst thing I've seen so far is difficulty and repetitiveness. While I find it easy on the highest difficulty I also suspect the game is keeping some surprise for later. The next worst thing are the whinny comments from the community (some famous Youtuber played it on his channel and attracted attention). Please, note this is an indie game, the company isn't CDPR and the pricetag is quite affordable (low for the fun I'm having, TBH).

I am actually a software developer myself. I develop software to control and test lighting. So, I understand just how difficult it really is, especially when dealing with Windows etc.
Yeah 400 hours, so I have over 10 million dollars, sold tonnes of coke to La Ballina, Grown Kilos of weed and also sold that, broke into Police Station and took files. So, I reckon I have Won the game!
Guys, fellow developers, shouldn’t the game tell me this, maybe produce a message saying “YOU HAVE WON!”
What is the conclusion here?
Should I become the new Eddie, the new La Ballina?
Should I be able to buy protection from the police?
I have also noticed a few memory bugs (runs out?).
Please, fellow developers, I am not criticizing, just merely suggesting a conclusion, a final part, Did I actually win.
It’s a fantastic game and have really enjoyed, hope you can take just little of this on board and even, maybe have a quick look at its memory management.
Many Thanks – AD.

The game was fun for about 20 hours when it first came out, then it became extremely repetitive and grindy with no payoff. The game ends quickly and gets an update around once every 6 months, with very little content coming from said updates. seriously this game has not gotten any new content that actually adds to the game since it's release.

The ""very positive"" recent reviews are all fake, the devs are pumping the store page with fake reviews to keep sales of a dead game going. If you're skeptical, just check the discussions page. The devs also ban people who talk shit about the game in their discord and are overall extremely unreceptive to new ideas or any form of criticism, whether its constructive or not.

Sneak the drugs back to your house.
Get on computer take orders for the drugs.
Sneak the drugs to buyer.

TLDR: Good game to sink 30-40+ hours in for the price. Hopeful for updates. (lol)

Lacking in endgame content currently, hopefully development keeps up with new content to keep the game fresh.
The base game consists of mixing drugs with other drugs and/or substances to make money, it gets this down well, however in the games current state, ""Drug Dealer Simulator"" feels more like [i]""Coke Dealer Simulator""[/i] once you reach the endgame.
Addition of other drugs like oxycodone, xanax, hydromorphone, research chemicals (ex- Hexen, Clonazolam, Etizolam, etc), would improve the game a lot, as the pill presser is rather useless currently with it's only function being to make ecstacy.

EDIT: Haven't played DDS for over 2 months now, waiting for the next update.

Very hesitate about buying this game due to I see a lot of drama around this game, like the devs release the trailer doesn't match with the game content (some content in trailer doesn't exist in an actual game ..yet.)

But after bought this game, yo, it's really fun and I enjoy to playing this game a lot. Drama aside, this game still has plenty of content that can keep you playing for hundred of hours. Even if the dev doesn't update more content, I don't even mad about that. Also, I didn't see any bug so far, only one glitches that when the police searching me and I run, they beat the sh i t out of me, then the text ""police is searching"" will be stuck on the screen. So here is the sum up: 

- Game work great in my specs (1440p max setting) no overheat, no max usage.
   i5-8500 3.0GHz 
  16GB of RAM 
  GTX 1070 8GB 
  SSD

- The game loop came very soon, or should I say, this is what it is. 
- Random generated NPC and quest. 
- Some NPC go home at night and go out at day time.
- Story is okay. Not much to say. 
- You can choose your client, like see a chick walking on the street, gift her some drug and vola! you has a new client. 
- Depend on how you mix your drug (yes you can create your own drug and sell it), it might make your client become a loyal one, or it can kill your client, like too much toxic in your drug because your drug contains 70% of washing powder.
- Day night cycle. 
- Weather systems 
- Buy and decor your house/hideout. 
- Police raid, if you do thing too loud, the police will notice and will soon launch the raid operation to your safe house, you have nothing to protect your safe house except gather as much stuff as you can and escape before the police arrives. 
- You have to planning your way, because the police patrol can appears anywhere, anytime, like even outside of your door.
- You can climb over wall, some people complain that they can't jump and run at the same time, well, the devs has fixed it, I can run and jump at the same time. 
- And more stuff that I have not discover yet.

people need to sleep, how do you expect a dealer to go out at 5AM immediately when he gets a call...
it should be like: you play the game normally, then you get a special order that tells you when to get there tomorrow instead of today, and it has like 1.1x - 2x payment based on how many drugs they want or the actual product type

but still, the game is fun and unique enough to be interesting to most people

update:
There some choices I understand that at his point would be hard to implement like cars but I think it would add so much to game play. If we are not going have cars why have some on the street in various places. I also am cracked up by the almost terminator level police speed and the pathing they have. The over-sized objects like beer bottles I am guessing are for effect. One thing that is crazy is why oh why do the junkies and dealers pick spots where you can be seen by police when on their patrols.

They have only now released their first big update, and its so useless (weed growing). No point in utilizing this feature and it doesnt even look nice... No bud, leaves look like a typical garden plant, not weed. 

If you are expecting a lot of playtime from this, maybe you will have a lot of playtime when they release useful content 2 years down the line.

The first review I left was in the very early days of this game and there was an issue with lagging making the game unplayable. That has long since been fixed. There have been updates to the world, some of the mechanics, and polishing of game play making it pretty amazing. I actually restarted my game now that I have a better understanding of the game and how to maximize my profits by mixing and stretching my products. So I can't speak to later mechanics of the game (raids, storing money in gold bars etc) but what they've done so far is a perfect balance of challenge and simulation enjoyment. There's enough of a grind to keep you trying but not enough of a grind where it feels like the same thing over and over and no leveling up. There is a good size playing area, and different ways to navigate from point A to point B. There is miscellaneous trash/debris/graffiti that the area feels lived in and realistic, although the concrete walls that separate the north from the south are a bit out of place (they remind me of barriers we used in Iraq) but I understand their purpose so it's not a deterrent for me. The addition of usable tunnels make the experience more immersive but be careful to remember how to get around, it gets disorienting.

In all seriousness, this game is fun as hell. I've had it for less than a week and have already wasted 60 hours of my life in it. There is so much to this game that make it fun that it would be hard to explain for my weed brain. It is a little disappointing that it isn't a bigger game. The content will surely get stale early for a lot of people. 

The devs have a relatively easy path to make this game absolutely amazing. They just need to expand on the content that is already available. More drugs, more areas, more ways to automate, expand, and develop your drug empire.

I am in love with this game and will surely continue to dump hours into it, but I know most people won't feel the same way.

You just sell the same dry weed to the same neighbors in the same ghetto neighborhood. You don't move up in the world. You do not become Stringer Bell.

You prepare baggies of drugs in a lab in a first person shooter format. Like Skyrim except without the alchemy menu, just picking up small herbs and mixing with with other small objects in first person.

Cops will search you without a warrant just because you walk near them. They only stop you. They do not stop literally anyone else. If it is nighttime, they will stop you on sight for just for being out at night. They do not stop anyone else even though it's a city-wide curfew (unexplained in the lore).

Moving drugs from your inventory to another person's is ridiculously hard. You can't make a 4g bag of drugs so you have to only use two 2g bags. You have to control-click to sell any amount other than ""all"" and you have to use a slider to select how many you want. Most people just want 1 bag. Nobody wants all bags. The only people who want more than one bag are people who want 4g. So that's just a difficulty built into the game. It's a built-in puzzle to seperate out who needs 4g of something which will require special attention. If you could somehow find the technology to create a 4g bag, everyone would only want 1 bag.

Gas stations are legally open for business all night but apparently it is illegal to walk to one.

There are no cars. Just thought that was funny.

Customers can get addicted to weed. Weed addicts will pay more for your weed. And they all know how to use encrypted messaging on private servers just so they can buy 2 grams of weed from their next-door neighbor.

This game is a 14 year old's idea of what a drug dealer is after watching 8 Mile. The dialogue is hilariously unrealistic. This game is nothing but a glorification of drugs in an attempt to appear edgy to young people. If you want to grow, play Stardew Valley. If you want to run from the cops, play GTA. If you want to sell baggies of dry dusty weed to five customers, just do it in real life. It's not that hard. That's why this game is so stupid. What's the point of simulating what I can easily do. Anybody can do this. It's literally easier in real life because you don't have to stick with an FPS format to make baggies of drugs on a tiny table. Wake me up when someone makes a game where you can become a heroin kingpin in West Baltimore selling testers to desperate broke junkies and siphon millions of dollars out of the projects.

682990,101721839,76561198219469833,0,3,16317,0,9097,1698248716,"DDS has a very solid game loop. During the day you order and pick up drugs, mix drugs with additives so they are safer, stronger and/or more addictive, spray-paint your logo, and give out free drugs (testers). At night you complete deliveries to customers and dealers, and pick up money from dealers, though this is done during a curfew, The game expects you to only commit crimes at night, which keeps exposure to law enforcement low. Police patrol most areas, and will sometimes search you during the day (based on your exposure) and will always search you after police hours, which is basically a curfew.

You can also eventually unlock the ability to sell large amounts of product wholesale to gangs, which is very profitable depending on which product it as. The early game takes a bit to build up, starting with a basic apartment which cannot be furnished beyond a single worktable and only two drugs available for sale. Eventually you can unlock ten total drugs (amphetamine, marijuana, ecstasy, crystal meth, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, dmt, lsd, and mushrooms), safe-houses of various sizes, as well as pharmaceuticals and other additives for mixing drugs.

You can mix any drugs together, though some have to be processed through various equipment which is unlocked through leveling up. There's also a simple skill upgrade system as well which make it easier not to be spotted by police, provides extra pockets, and other things. Drugs and additives have various strengths, strengthening of mixes, toxicities, and addictiveness. Balancing these things through experimentation with new formulas helps keep the game interesting, as addicted clients buy more product, but are also more likely to overdose.

The game is an excellent return for your money. I'm near the end of my first playthrough at the time of writing this and am very happy with my purchase. There are still additional features being added, and some bug fixes and quality of life improvements are badly needed, but overall it's a great game. A third sector will be added soon, and hopefully more drugs as well as more additives, as there are only four pharmaceutical and five non-pharmaceutical additives. I'd love to see more drugs such as crack, pcp, cannabis concentrates, and others added, in addition to things like caffeine pills and other common real life drug additives. It would also be great to be able to grow and buy precursor materials so we can go full Breaking Bad in game.

Oh and please add the Dark Web! There's already a docks right there on the map, we could just run over there, get past patrols, and drop it on a boat. That'd give more options for wholesaling other drugs, which is desperately needed to make the endgame more interesting and allow for more specialization. As is I can handle selling all drugs (albeit only in sector A, almost maxed out on dealers), two growhouses with 75 or so plants, processing that marijuana by adding additive to bulk the weight for wholesale, trying out new mixes, and moving things around. I'd love to do future playthroughs where I can specialize in any drug and produce it from farm to table.

If you like business games, like simulation games (with a tiny bit of jank, admittedly) and don't mind the subject material, which is taken seriously for the most part aside from a few memes, and doesn't actually display any drug use onscreen (though you can sample your own products), then check this out and pick it up.",1635360352,1635380217,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It just gets boring and there is nothing to do after. I have played the game to the end (or atleast what I think is the end because nothings happens at any time after) and have enjoyed the game each and every single time.

A part of the game that I just can't seem to understand is growing weed. and making own drugs. Idk what items I need to mix together to get dry marihuana. So maybe make some kind of book you can buy with some mixes in it. And maybe just say put 1-10 grams of ... in the mix, so the player has to do some things themselfes

- You played Dope Wars in the 90s, or
- You get wired before you're tired enough to sleep,
- You find running numbers and peeking around corners therapeutic.

However, if you aren't specifically looking for exactly this game, you should wait for a solid discount.

[b]Annoyances:[/b]

- Not all Walls are Climbable, and it is not always obvious which. When running from Police, try to favour paths you have taken before, and be wary that occasionally the mid-height wall with a flat top simply will not allow you to jump over.

- The Workstations are a little fiddly. If you prefer a high DPI mouse, you may benefit from a DPI Switch, so that you can lower the sensitivity when using the Workstation - Object Menus require you to aim at the object while navigating the Menu and if your cursor slips off it the Menu will reset when you get it back up. Also there is no quick-key for Packaging Product, so I hope your Mousewheel works!

- Outdoor Plants are a lot more RNG than you may think! Even if you find a spot to grow something which is not visible from any road or Police Patrol path, your plants will still Despawn over time! IE, Police Officers do not actually have to see a Plant to Despawn it. I recommend waiting to buy Indoor Growing Equipment, but if you do use Outdoor Seeds, make sure to tuck each plant in the tiniest, most obscure corners you can, EG: In a backyard, far from a road, at the edge of a map, in a fenced area between a shed and a dumpster. A spot fulfilling all these stipulations might make it to full growth. I just watched 10 plants which were very well hidden disappear before my eyes, and there is nothing you can do to stop them.

- As far as I can tell, there's no way to add mass to MJ with Sugar ;P

[b]Other Tips[/b]

Bag Capacity is a little more strict than you might expect. You can't stuff as much into a bag as you might in real life, so remember that it is a game, and the inventory makes some concessions to improve the challenge and organisational demands on the player. If you are spending more than say, $300 on an Order, get yourself a Medium Backpack from the Gas Station first, it takes a lot less than a Kilo of anything to max out your starting bag!

Try to get some property quickly. I waited and saved for better properties, but even poor locations and facilities help maintain your Rep in a neighbourhood, and waiting has made it quite annoying for me, as I have to buy paint and spray tags constantly.

[b]TL:DR[/b]

The game doesn't give me enough variation to keep the buzz of playing. It needs more content involved, not just new areas. As others have said, it gets very repetitive by about level 7.

Pros:

 - Combining ingredients is fun. Coming up with concoctions and different ratios then selling them on is great! A little bit of washing liquid never hurt anyone after all...

Cons:

 - Buy drugs, mix, sell to client, run home and avoid cops. Repeat. 
 - Base building is really poor, I'd rather they took this out and just furnish the hideouts for us. It's painful
 - The game has no memory function to show recipies you've tried and the outcome of those. This is a feature that's essential if we are going to be making our own versions
 - Should also be a way of unlocking recipies so you have an idea of what does work.
 - Graphically it's really poor. I know this isn't a multi-million pound game, but it does need an update..

- Things I like -
: Main voice actor is flawless. Could not have picked better.
: Good loop.
: Good progression.
: Mixing drugs is pretty damn fun.

- Things I don't like -
: The game is unplayable without the wiki, and unfortunately the wiki is really bad. There are several parts of the game that just need a little information to them. A lot of new players have no idea how to package product and get frustrated, make that a mandatory part of the tutorial.
: We need way more additives, categories of additives, and a rebalance of their stats.
: Mouse movement feels gelatinous.
: Compass is almost always broken.
: While never mentioned in any dialogue (that I've heard so far) there are some buildings that play music with racial slurs. Really wish I could turn that part off.

- Things I want -
: Employees of any kind.
: Cop bribes. (maybe based on reputation?)

Alright gamers I never write reviews but this game makes me feel like I have to.

This game is good. The main gameplay loop is enjoyable, I find myself playing it mindlessly while watching Critical Role.
The game gets really easy after like level 15 because at that point you've unlocked Cocaine which is the most profitable drug in the game. You get to the point around level 18-20 where your money is meaningless, basically a DDS billionaire. You can buy every property and every object/furniture like 80 times over just like Pablo ;). The devs are pretty inconsistent with their updates and they havent had any real new gameplay content since the Weed growing update LAST spring right after the release of the game. The most recent Harty Pard update adds new drugs which are pretty well not worth your time because they're no where near the level of Cocaine in terms of margin. I find myself moving kilos of coke, not worth my time to deal in dime bags of acid and weed. All in all its a fun game and I enjoy it still BUT this game needs more gameplay or story and better comms between the player base and devs in regards to updates. Community modding support would be dope as well. I would say only buy this on sale given the real content in the game but i've more than got my 22.79 out of it. cheers",1614314163,1633410206,True,17,0,0.714851200580596924,2,True,False,False

Yup, here we are 1ish year later. Just gonna keep it short this time. Abandon all hope that this game will ever be something similar to what was promised in the early promotions. 

Updates, while still happening, are few and far between, and when they do arrive, they are A) either something very minimal, barely notable micro tweaking, maybe even an occasional QOL feature if you are lucky or B) Something a bit bigger, which the devs have worked on for a very long time, but instead they are often completely pointless features no one asked for and which dont contribute to actually evolving this game, in really any direction.

And on top of that, the devs really like to use this games NEWS/UPDATE feed to promote other games, games which have a very similar vibe as DSS of promising great things, but ending up pretty barebones, games which officially ""have no association with this games developer or publishers"", even though the patterns are suspiciosly similar.  Yup, nothing shady at all with that...

(ORIGINAL REVIEW, posted shortly after the game released on steam)
 Note: This is just gonna be a very short warning to everyone considering purchase instead of an actual review.
Playtime by the time of writing this review: 29 hours. [/i]

Super-shortly said: Avoid for now, but it has lot of potential. The developers utilized a very scumbag approach to marketing, so I recommend caution whenever dealing with products/games from these developers. 

A bit more information: So I bought this game the first day of launch, I`ve never heard of it before, but it SEEMED really cool. I even tried the demo before purchase and was quite impressed with it, so I bought the game. However; Now I can confirm that the store page at the time of this titles launch, was a prime example of FALSE ADVERTISING. 

At the release date; this store page contained different information from what it contains by the time of writing this review: It had a trailer which clearly showed: 1. that the player would be able to grow their own drug-plants 2. A fighting scene showing the player getting punched by a civilian person and 3. The ability to ""PARTY!"", in the form of laying by a pool and shooting some glass bottles etc.  

Almost 2 weeks later of launch, NONE of the above-mentioned 3 features are currently present. Instead we have a game which is far from complete ( lacking content, technically ""rough around the edges"" etc) and should be labeled as an EARLY ACCESS-title. 

(But they removed those lying trailers and GIFS from the store page, so they did something right at least.)

However, it is IMPORTANT TO NOTE: that the developers are actually still working on this game and are planning to add more features over time, so the game will get better with enough time. 

But I still cant forgive that dirty marketing tactic at launch day, so Im gonna leave a THUMBS DOWN.

i wanted baddly to support this dev because i like support my own country devs - its quite tough for them to shine on the market.

played some, got 2 hideouts full of coke bricks lying on the floor, desks and wardrobes, suitcases and trining bags... like ton of it because i was selling only this in the late game, clean not mixed and still i didnt have time to fulfill all the request dailly.

------------------------------- some SPOILERS not that it really matters --------------------------------------

[spoiler] I dont understand why people are still buying games from you. its a mystery for me.
Every game you pull out is left half way and most of them are just run click simulators.

Back to this game, yeah you do things, lvl up quite quickly, open the second sector, choose the side you want to partner up and ... and nothing, there is no end content xD so you are basiclly a dealer with unlimited cash with no way to move further up or do anything with your money besides buying another safehouse and a fucking bed or chair or lamp xD DrugSimsDealerSimulator xD

In mid game you start to ship bigger packages so the run with coke or crystal start to be a big pain in the ass because it is a time speed run to get the amount needed for next drop. there is no end game, the only end game is not having enough time to do every drop to clients and the to the mafia or cartel... 
Beginning is fun, when you dont know this game, when everything is new but after 6-8 hours it starts to get boring and iritaiting. yeah you can buy all safe houses but there are only 2 that are really needed the rest is trash fill of map space.

furniture   xD 
you only need a table for your mix things and wardrobe for storage...

Now to the mixing, in the early game it is really good to mix stuff for profit, but after 2 or 3h (or even less than 2h, depend on the play style) there is not any logic reason to mix stuff, just go and sell the clean product. i played almost 40h because i played a lot with mixing and restarted the game 2 or 3 times... 

Spliting drugs in the game have no sense at all - you just loose time, just spitt everything in 1gr bags for dealers/clients - the mafia/cartel have an amount needed in one or two or later 3 training bags... so 3 trips to fulfill the requests and its always 1 suitcase of cash, but when you take out the 3xTraining bags income from the suitcase, you cant put it back in becouse its to much money xD

Your dealers (invisible drug sellers for the eyes of the police) are just clients that want bigger amounts of product, there is nothing more to it.

The invading FDA is a joke and i had problems to made them to invade me so i gave up...
Police - mhmm . Their paths are the same always so its really easy to remember them, you got a bag full of coke, if you see police just throw the bag in front of them on the ground your clean now. 
if the police are running after you, just hide around the corner to loose the line of sight and throw away your bag and thats it. the police dog is ok to, it smells the drugs on you but not in the big training bag lying on the ground. 

Now the content developing time and stuff that they are adding xD
FFS watch some crimes documentary or i dont know maybe narcos something and learn from them xD

WEED UODATE YEAAAH plant your weed on the ground just on the path loop of the police - it legal after all xD water it, wait, wait, cut, divide, sell - it way easier to buy the shit from the one and only dude that suport you with 50KG of crystal for the cartel xD LOGIC - this is a rlly big time waster

Underground update!! now you dont have to use the teleport from one manhole to another like before. now you can run to the other side thru an underground system ...

And soon in the future update, you will get furniture overhaul - you will have the option to sell or transport your furniture to other safe houses xD BIG UPDATE !!!! YEAHH  [/spoiler]

Night day system - so day, you can go out and sell drugs normaly, sometimes the police will want to search you and thats it.
Night is martial law - no one is allowed to leave the appartament,and you get bigger income...

You can use drugs. i dont know, but i would recommend the devs to watch few YT videos on the subject ""how some drugs work""
In this game speed makes you see in the dark and other stuff is mostly the same with different adjustments to contrast collors...

You can probably buy this game on keys services for around 3 to 5 dollars. that the amount this game is worth for its content and how the content is made and added - purchased pre made textures from 3rd party??? 

Rly - its a good game for few buks and it have a really cool idea but forget about the future content i dont know if the devs are still working on this game to make it at least with an ending or they abandoned it. so go watch some gameplay and after 1h this is all you get.

Yes, I say I'd recommend it, but I'd like the devs to keep working on it; which I hear is about fallen out of. The experience I've had so far, was worth the price (entertained me for over a week), and if you've ever played a gmod roleplay server with drugs, this kind of sparks that interest, single-player, keep in mind. So I guess I'd say it's my own personal gmod drug roleplay with day/night cycles (and time skip), me vs the fuzz.
   The game starts off slow, is always repetitive, and until you can manufacture your own goods is where it really starts to pick up. You start off in your one apartment, every level you can use to advance your skills, and will probably be searched a LOT in the beginning. You don't unlock growing weed until level 15, and just to get there can take a while, from my experience. Your sales quantities aren't that much, nor are your amount of customers at the time.
   The further along you get - meaning, the more you can feel immersed just running around being a dealer, repetitively - the more houses become available to purchase and customize the interior, more people to meet and their drugs, more dealers available for you with bigger deals. Constant cash flow. Your exposition level is really affected in later game - do most deals at night, whether be cash delivery or contraband.
   It is nice when your customers want to become your dealer. Ultimately, I gotta say - they know a lot of crackheads. Some bought MJ and Amp when they were customers. Turn into dealers and buying meth by the buttload...
   My own interests are drawing me into  1) having a marijuana grow op - with a house nearby - CHECK.  2) Think I still need to meet said gang for their drugs to manufacture anything else - and have a house for each diff drug op. If the devs put more into the game, I could do  3) set up a fake drug house to get raided in and have a shootout with the fuzz

+++Like seriously, a book of recipes would be awesome. From mixing to manufacturing. The works. I thought growing weed was fun, and then being able to crystalize it, but that's really no good to any of the people on the streets for anything; it's just used to cut and mix with other crystal drugs - or powder, if powdered types are used. I thought it would have been awesome to 'sprinkle' the crystals on the weed itself, selling a higher potency bag of MJ, making them want more all the time(?)",1631539864,1631539864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anyways! Drugs! Yay! There is not a lot to this game, but it is satisfying to pull off the things you can do!
You start of by selling weed and speed. Then you unlock more areas after getting respect in your current area, leveling up, then you can get dealers who will sell for you and so on... It's a simple game, but it does what it is designed to do.

You can mix drugs to make them more potent, or so I have heard (Not that far yet), thus enabling you to get people addicted to your stuff so that you always will have orders coming in. 

Be warned: This game is about drugs and evading the police. If you do not like that combo, this game is not for you. This game is more for people who just wants a different kind of ""simulator"" game, and it is fun to kill time with.

Maybe a choice system to where you have world changing choices and they effect the world and gang activity based in areas. Also a bigger and more diverse map would also improve the game tremendously.

- You sell dr**s.
- You mix dr**s.
- You run from cops.
- You profit.

For the current stage now it's already enough to entertain me a while.
You really feel the progression. Every night's run make you so nervous, because when you got caught you lose everything that night. The game reward you for taking risky moves.

But the game is kinda still unfinished. After you met the mafia boss, nothing happens.
I kinda don't think the dev will finish but will just move to another title. What a pity. I hope not.

It felt like Thief Sim just in a different setting. There is nothing wrong with this game in terms of glitches, bugs, or gameplay. It's fun and challenging. However, it suffers from the same massive drawback that Thief Sim suffers from and that is that there is zero replayability. This has even less replayability than Thief Sim though. At least in Thief Sim, it will take you a long time to clean out every house. Here is literally the boring grind over and over again. I like that instead of Thief Sim, it's infinite what you can do in this game but it renders it boring after a while. Also only other knock I can give this is the perk system is absolutely awful. The cops will find drugs on you and will spot you even if you have stealth and illusionist maxed out. Only runner and stamina work and are remotely useful. Salesman does nothing in letting you raise your prices. Also one other knock I can give is, this game expects you to know the street names of every drug and so I lost clients and delayed progression accidentally. It never explains that or recipes for things and the spray painting and respects mechanics make absolutely zero sense. So honestly, this game is fun and a good challenge but there are many things you have to work around and it can get boring. I hit recommend because I do enjoy playing this but only get it if it's on sale. 6 out of 10.",1630882671,1630882671,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In short, you are a low level drug dealer under the wing of a much larger cartel. Game play loop consists of ordering drugs to be smuggled into the ghetto, then selling those drugs. This snowballs, more money means more drugs, more drugs means more money. Eventually you can start hiring your own dealers and advance past petty, back alley exchanges and into the world of distribution. At a point, you can even start producing your own drugs, negating the cost of smuggling from the cartel. You'd think this would cause a conflict of interest but, evidently not.  For the most part its very well done. Everyone likes playing the bad guy every now and again. 

The game world centers around a T.R.A.P. Im not sure if the game ever explains what that stands for, if it did, my mistake. Essentially, its a ghetto where crims, addicts and society's refuse is dumped and kept under a watchful eye of a specialized police force. From what I can tell, anyway. 

There are some nagging complaints. Being early access this is of course subject to change and the dev seems to have an idea of what hes going for, so these complaints are more general nitpicks. The game at large seems to be headed in the right direction. 

First. Man, please use spellcheck. And Google. There are a gratuitous amount of spelling, grammar and general knowledge mistakes. Even drugs are spelled wrong. 

There is a large amount of safehouses available. But due to the small size of the map, most of these are of dubious use. For example, There is a safehouse directly across the street from your main one, and another in the back alley of that one. You can run north to south across the map in under a minute. East to west, stopping at the checkpoint, can be done in about a minute thirty. Its not a large map by any means, and thats fine. In fact, I prefer smaller, detailed maps than colossal empty ones. But when a district amounts to only one block, a dozen or so safehouses feels like overkill. 

The police are pushovers. They are very easy to spot at a distance, even at night. They look almost identical to the merc units from Farcry 3. Putting even a couple skill points into runner and stamina, turns the police from an obstacle, and into little more than an annoyance. 

The D.E.A. Never met them. Been a bad boy, even tried to get a raid to see what would happen. Nada. Had my exposure maxed out, multiple warnings that I was attracting too much attention and apart from a marginal increase in beat cops, nothing really happened. 

At the moment there is no endgame. Im sure this is 100% because its still in early access and it just hasnt been added or even thought about yet. As it stands, money is used to upgrade the business and rent and decorate safehouses but not much else. Again, this is more of a heads up than a real complaint. An endgame is coming, its just not here yet. 

Overall, quite happy. Ive already gotten my money's worth out of it. Pretty excited to see where it goes.",1630877150,1630877150,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The crazy lag has been completely fixed (other than when you first enter the sewers, but it clears up after it loads) So far i haven't had a save get deleted on me, going through like 4 updates, so that's awesome. Devs have added a lot more content to the game, but still have a long way to go if they want something that's going to stick around for a while. I still say, if you get the game on sale then go for it, but other than that i wouldn't unless you have money to spare. It's an ""okay"" game overall, could be a lot better. Needs better movement system such as a scooter, or a skateboard. Game gets super repetitive after a few hours, and gets super difficult once you NEED to navigate the sewers. They are a mess, and have hardly any direction for where to go, you basically just guess. You'll go in circles a lot, unless i""m just missing something. Anyways, its an alright game, get it if you have money to spare, or on sale.

One thing I would love to see, is co-op/multiplayer, playing this with a friend would be simply awesome.
I am aware that the devs don't think that'll happen, but I think it would improve the game by a lot, and presumably add more buyers, as friends would ask their friends to buy it to play with them..

It doesn't have to be so you can play with 5 friends, even though that also would be fun, but just one or two more. Pablo Escobar had 2 very good friends, which means he used the multiplayer option in real life..

Firstly, there are a few bugs that can really screw you over. The biggest is you will all of a sudden freeze where you are and if you are carrying and theres police by, you're done. Another is I accidentally moved my mortar under the desk shelf and it vanished, never to be seen again. Theres no real tutorial on some of the equipment so its trial and error. Some customers will spawn near police cars so you can't deal to them and lose reputation. 

The sewers, The god dam sewers, who invented them? Firstly, there is no map. Luckily there is one online but even then it takes you many attempts to learn the sewers, I even had to jot down my own map. You end up losing clients wasting so much time down there and your reputation drops. The sewer lags if you run too much. The water slows you down and why make us keeping unlocking the gates? Its a pointless task. Apart from the rubbish sewers and the overpriced tunnel, there should be an option to build underground tunnels or have drug mules or something. The sewers nearly made me refund this game.

You can't move equipment from one hideout to another so you keep having to buy stuff every time you unlock new hideouts and think 'hey this is a better location'. This can start to become a bit of a pain and tiresome. 

When you reach dealers, you will find that occasionally one of their clients dies and its your fault...how....nothing wrong with the product, you just gave the client too much. This results in your products losing value and having to lower their price. 

Overall, the concept is great and the micro managing of drugs is fun. It can be a real rush when your walking along to sell and the cops catch you and you have to leg it. It can become a chore having to jump from sector A to B to deal as by the time you've done one, the reputation has dropped considerably in the other sector. 

If like me you enjoy simulation games with business involved, I'd recommend it on sale.

After not playing this game for a while and seeing a few""Major Updates"" come out for it, I decided to pick it back up. Sad to say, the Devs believe adding a few re-skins and a crude tunnel system are ""major updates"". This game, while fun to play at first, lacks in oh so many ways still. As this game has been out for well over a year now I doubt there will be an actual major update that addresses any of the issues. Maybe someone who actually cares what their fan base wants will make a copy cat game, but it is doubtful. 

At this point, I would actually drop my rating to a 3/10 as even the smallest of fixes is likely to be overlooked by the devs.

THE DEVS SEEM TO HAVE GIVEN UP ON THIS GAME.

Which is sad because it could be fun if they just fixed the minor stuff!!!

Reading through the Discussion channel is just months of people complaining about the same issues, and no resolve. 

First of all, this game has a lot of competing mechanics (competing for your time, not actual competition). When you let any one of these fall out of line you lose customers. Then, the amount of time you spend rebuilding that one area, the others go to crap.  

The games primary mechanic is a reputation factor. Your rep varies from area to area, faction to faction.  You increase your rep primarily by selling drugs (makes sense), and your rep drops over time. lower rep = less orders. The problem is, some of the areas are tiny, so you only get a few clients. And then on top of that, you can lose 50% of your rep in a few in game hours, even though you've filled every clients order. To top it off, If you sell during the day, it increase police presence and overall chance of being raided by the DEA. Raise that limit enough and making a small delivery without being caught is beyond difficult, then you lose clients, and rep, and then the game is just a pain. 

IMO the Rep feature needs a massive update, if not removal. 

Police. Look, I get it, It's a drug game; police will be involved. But the police are OP. The devs took weapons / fighting out of the game so all you can do is run. But you can only run so much before you run out of stamina. Now yes, you can level up stamina, but guess what, cops never run out of stamina. PLUS, they get tasers... Your only option is to get into one of your hideouts (which you have to buy but can only buy through the ATM which raises cop / dea presence when you deposit ""dirty"" money, and the only way to clean it is to give it to a guy who takes a 40% cut. So buying 1 property can take A LONG TIME). The hit box on the hideout doors is hard enough to hit while running, Forget about when youre in the dark and cant even see where the ground meets a wall....  And no matter the time of day, no matter your rep or your, for want of a better term, wanted level; if you're within eyeshot of police, youre getting searched, or... run. 

Border? So there's a wall that separates the two halves of the ghetto for no reason. There are 3 openings in the wall that are police checkpoints. You will get searched, so you cant cross over with anything illegal. There is a system of sewers you can travel through to avoid the police checkpoints, but, you cant bring any bags, so youre limited to the small quantities you can carry in your pockets. Theres also a ""construction tunnel"" that runs under the whole city. But you have to pay a worker a varying and costly amount to use it, so its not useful until late in game. You used to be able to throw your bags over the wall and collect them when you get to the other side, but the devs nerfed your throwing strength so you can only get it over a few select places if you're lucky enough to avoid cops and not have to attempt the throw 35 times. 

TL/DR: 
- Rep system is... Bad, forces you to have more areas, rep decays faster, cant keep rep high = less customers. So effectively the game forces you to lose customers.
- Cops are OP / annoying as all get out
- checkpoint wall is incredibly stupid game mechanic that was only annoying until devs nerfed it for no reason making it beyond stupid. 

4/10 - Could be much much better with just a little TLC but this game seems to be failing more and more each day so the devs appear to have given up.",1607957398,1626557414,False,2,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

The beginning of the game is a blast, getting new drugs to sell, finding new ways to cut and mix them to maximize profit. all the new equipment upgrades you can buy and the new stores that open up as you play it feels like youre constantly advancing as a drug dealer, getting reputation with buyers, the two gangs, the cartel, and entire city blocks. however after all your hard work building up and finally getting that sought after gang introduction you almost immediately reach a point where the only thing worth doing is delivering either coke or meth to your respective gang. nearly everything else is a waste of time. you dont need to uphold rep because all it does is increase single buyers which you have progressed way past. you dont need to mix drugs because the time/benefit ratio to mixing 1500g is way too time consuming. you wont be selling anything other than either meth or coke so no formula experimentation. and the largest problem of all: what the hell am i supposed to do with $100,000? sure buy every property, but for what purpose? not wasting my time with weed. i guess i could store my thousand suitcases in there. the game comes to a dead halt. its not worth your time to do anything but gang missions, and why would you do them? theres nothing more to buy. the updates seem to be adding to the early game which is awesome! but what about the dead end? some decorative weapons like rifles or swords or some paintings or just anything to spend cash on would be great. or even mod support so the comunity can add things. hell add in strippers for all i care. just please add in something to do with my multitude of suitcases filled with soo much cash i cant even drop the cash to have my own money bed because the stack wont fit again.

**edit**
there is a painting shop i just found it, so thankyou devs thats awesome! initial rating updated from 7/10 to 8/10 and changed recommendation to yes instead of no",1622625103,1624194833,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Here you start of as a simple drug dealer, getting richer, selling more, getting more supplier. It gets fun as you raise you're level, and raise the number of things you could do. This game keeps me on my toes! The Cop chases are super exciting, and when you get Caught, and tased, Man do you feel the shock in real life!  Its pretty great, but the things that I think would improve this are you need to brighten the night time a bit, have a feature that shows drug mixes stats, and whether clients like it or not. Also it would be great if you could give hints on some of the tasks, as some quests you wouldn't know to do.

Now, is it a fun game? The simple answer is yes. Although i used to enjoy the game i have a lot of trouble enjoying it now. The game lacks a lot of new content, like a lot. A prime example is their updates, they take forever! The developers update the game every few months but barely bring anything to it. It took them a little over 3 months to add the new ""Sewer Dealer Bro"" to the main branch when all it does is add a new sewer map and a little new police mechanic that honestly doesn't make the game anymore fun than it already was. This is very frustrating when somebody like me who really, and i mean REALLY wants to enjoy the game, just cant anymore. Although im not sure if this is true but i've heard there are about 4+ developers working on this project and it pains me to say this but if that is true than this is just plain embarrassing. Either you guys lack the skill to develop (Which i dont think is the case) or you guys are just really lazy. Another thing is that the developers dont listen to the community whatsoever. They have a steam forum and even a discord server where they ask you to leave suggestions for the game but i have yet to see one single suggestion implemented into the game other than weed growing (which should have already been in the game!) and this new sewer update. To top it off i want to say this. If you are looking to buy this game only expecting about 10 hours of pure enjoyment and maybe replaying it in the far future this is the game for you. But if you are looking to have this game installed on your computer for the rest of your life expecting game changing updates, dont buy it.

So that said...

Pros / Fun Stuff
- Ordering, mixing drugs with drugs or cutting it with salt, sugar, etc
- Inventory management is reasonably easy 
- Movement and HUD is overall smooth, however HUD could do with an option to keep objectives displayed
- Managing your suspicion levels
- Supplying dealers and customers while ensuring they don't OD

Cons / Chore Stuff
- Want an option to keep objectives displayed
- Suspicion levels can easily go wildly high or low depending on how you do business
- Drug storage, jars, containers and equipment could do with more information
- Furniture storage is poor, is large compared to the small and awkward lay out of safe houses
- No end game content
- No objectives past a certain point

Suggestions
- More HUD options
- Fix furniture/wardrobes/cupboards to have better storage capacity
- Money should not take up as much space as it does
- Drugs should not take up as much space as it does
- More availability of cutting agents
- Better explanation of equipment, growing, processing, making of different drugs
- More stuff to buy and more area to explore
- More objectives
- Reputation drop needs to dramatically lower.
- Improve smoothness of movement when running

There have been a lot of negative things said about this game and the devs in the past couple months. But listen - I have had so much fun with this game in the half year that I've had it. I couldn't care less about this ""Scam"" that other players seem so invested in trashing. I appreciate the new update and play this game as a mindless escape from reality, not something that I expect 5 star perfection or amazing polish from. I understand that maybe they could work a little harder at things, but I've never had any major issues ( Save for the weird resolution/menu button problem I mentioned when I first reviewed, but that was user error).

This game gets a 10/10 for being the game I default to to escape reality. Whether we get no new updates or a million new ones, it doesn't matter, I can zone out for hours playing this. Whether those potential updates ""Use crappy assets, or don't seem worth the wait"" I don't give a shit, honestly. At least they're putting something in, unlike some devs, who truly have given up.

I was really hopping that with the last update they would do something with economy balancing,work on endgame ,and many cool ideas that the community have been suggesting since game came out,but it was not the case we got sewers...yeyy.
 I play other games that are made by single developers and understand that it takes time to develop a game with a small team,but this studio ,again in my opinion and what prompted me to give them a not recommended review is the lack of communication with the community the lack of passion for this game,the lack of a road-map or any indications of what are the future plans with it, just sad that a single dev game can communicate and update and fix bugs more than a team of devs.

Those out of the way, this game is weirdly satisfying, and fun to pick up for a bit of time every so often, but you probably won't find yourself playing for long stretches of time, simply because the content is pretty repetitive, all things considered. Still though, I've definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game. The latest update brings the sewers to the game, which is a nice switch up, and gives you another way to move between the two sectors. It doesn't bring a whole lot of new content, but it's a nice change, and pretty impressive considering as far as I can tell, Byterunners is actually just one person in Poland.

My review will split into two parts, one is about their discord server, other is about the game.

Some basic info about my past with the game:

My first encounter with the game was a trailer, that showed an action-packed game, with a lot of opportunities.
After the game has been released, I noticed this trailer disappeared from steam. I decided not to buy the game, but after months I only read positive reviews, and I loved the concept, so
 I bought the game 14th of October 2020.

I'll start my review about the things I experienced on the discord server.

The server is a playground for some moderators with a mental disorder of excessive power strivings.
 If you decide to join and say something they don't like you will get moderated, there are no guidelines or valid rules they do anything they want, you can easily be moderated for saying a criticism in a diplomatic, non-toxic way.  Verbal self-defense is useless, it will get you banned, even if facts are on your side.
Strong censorship is present on the server. Messages randomly get deleted, mostly if somebody is unhappy with the game's development. 
Warnings from the moderators often contain passive-aggressive and vulgar terms.
They allow themselves to say sexual references, and they are going to do it.

Personally, from a publisher as big as Movie Games, I would expect much more professionalism.

Movie Games, wait what?

Yes, the actual developer team has no contact with the community on Discord. The people you see with the Dev role are mostly employees of the publisher, they are just there for no reason.

Let's talk about the game.

It is enjoyable and fun for the first 10 hours, as you level up you will start to feel the emptiness. 
You will realize that you spent your precious time running around and distributing products.  It's become monotone, you will have a large amount of cash, that you can't use, because there is no proper game economy. You will endlessly wait for the next patch, that brings positive changes, but you will feel disappointed because the developers won't listen to the community.
Hundreds and thousands of suggestion have been made on how to improve the game, clever and wise suggestions I might add,
but the community's wishes found no listening ears.

It's been a very depressing experience for me. 
Sadly, I can't refund it anymore.
Please instead of buying this game, spend that money on something, like chocolate you like. You deserve it, but you don't deserve the suffering this game causes you.

You could just keep going, buy a bunch of a cool things and decorate all your hideouts.. until you reload your save and they're all empty.

You start small and grow pretty quick, by the time you have big drops you have more money then you could spend. In my opinion it still has much to improve especially the mid to late game, after lvl 25-30 (aprox) there isn't anything new to unlock or do.

Suggestions to devs (take 'em or leave 'em):
- MAIN SUGGESTION:  I would like to choose what neighborhoods I sell on, maybe add location of clients/dealers or a configuration in shaddyCom which allows this (like certain drugs are disabled)
- Consider adding late game unlocks/mechanics. Get enough reputation to buy off cops in checkpoints or look the other way for X time (it should be really expensive)
- Add more plants. Coca seeds to make Cocaine from scratch or poppy seeds for heroin.
- Add bigger labs (maybe for late game) with possibility to produce synthetic drugs from scratch
- Add base drug quality for more complexity, maybe with the posibility of hireing cooks with a certain skill set.
- Add more utility to pitcoin, honestly I see no need to use it right now since it's easier to pay Eddie multiple times with cash and it saves you the pitcoin conversion cost.
- Review Police. Maybe add corrupt cops that steal your stuff, take bribes to look the other way
- Add skills to your dealers and/or clients: ""Seller skill"" for more frequent sells, ""Ninja skill"" for less exposure and ""Loyalty skill"" this would be if the person gets caught and you have a higher chance of them not throwing the heat towards you.
- Add more risk: competitors / street thieves / informants / cameras
- More missions please. Change some unlocks to be mission based instead of just lvl based.
- Add new district that isn't as easy to smuggle but and certain rewards to do so, might need to plant drugs on a vehicle and wait a certain time to pick it up passed the checkpoint or another city and you have to plant drugs on a plan or boat, that would be awsome to see.

These are just some of the things I thought about during my playthrough, I want to end the note by saying it's a really good game with A LOT of potential, keep up the good work.

To the point: this game is a SCAM! DO NOT BUY IT! This publisher (MovieGames) specialises in creating noname shell companies which you can find literally no information about. If you do not believe me just try finding any information about this dev company  ’Byterunners Game Studio’.  I believe they do this to extort money from the publisher and have easy access to it so the game wasn’t made to be a game, it was made to be a bridge between inaccessible money and themselves. That is why this game is in this absolute sorry state and that is why the patches were so slow and crappy. They buy a few assets and use them to create the illusion that they actually do work on the game when they couldn’t give less crap about it. They make a couple of days work last for months and then sell it as hard work because they are indie company and they have just a handful of developers. Bullcrap, anyone remotely versed in unreal engine development knows that they barely touch the game.

This game was advertised borderline falsely, legally it wasn’t false advertisement but many-many customers were fed up because they felt cheated and scammed. They tried their hardest to hide it after the drama, the trailer was a blacklisted topic on their official discord, they would instantly ban you by bringing it up and hide behind the typical twisted reasons of „causing drama/toxicity”. But thankfully the internet doesn’t forget so it can still be found and people can draw their own conclusions for themselves: https://youtu.be/eV7j06tZzFY  For the record I personally would call this false advertisement because it was only removed AFTER a few days of the game's release.

The game is still filled with bugs which wouldn’t be an issue if they were new, but I as a beta tester experience such old bugs that were with me at launch, typos that I had reported a dozen times. Honestly how hard can it be to change a few strings in the span of an entire year? They reworked the map for no reason other than to keep up the illusion that they are working and the result caused unimaginable amount of performance issues, everyone has performance issues now, doesn’t matter how beast of a computer you have. The version that serves as a demo, called „free sample” can be found in the store as a free game and that doesn’t have this „updated” map. The demo version you can see on this storepage is not that version I am talking about, I haven’t had the „pleasure” to try this version out because I simply cannot install it… The font they are using to display the task list in game is incredibly hard to read. It actually makes me feel like I’m dyslexic because I have to concentrate to read it. I have pointed this out to the developers plenty of times and not just me, but as usual it wasn’t even dignified with acknowledgement. Can’t provide a picture as an example so I will try my best to replicate it: „D E L I V E R  2 G  O F  C O C A I N E  T O  O D D A R A F A L”.  Yes it is something awful like this. Every letter is capital, the space between letters and words are barely distinguishable (unfortunately steam removes the extra spaces so I can't create a perfect replica so I will have to assume that you have good enough imagination or copy paste it, put 2 or 3 spaces between the WORDS and see for yourself) It is nothing like in the videos you can see on this store page. The public roadmap which has little to no information, is literally just a picture with a few pictures that reference the milestones so it leaves you with your creativity to guess what those might be. It was abandoned for some odd reason I don't know why, but no one has been notified by that, everyone realised this fact by simply seeing the direction the developers go with this game. Such little things matter a lot because they show their undeniable attitude towards the game: they do not care about the game. This is their bread and butter and they don’t care to make the game more enjoyable or more comfortable to play it for you even after  months of begging.

I would even write a negative review on the publisher but unfortunately I can’t do that, I would advise against buying anything from MovieGames.",1620659196,1620664822,False,274,9,0.881571829319000244,17,True,False,False

I like watching my $$ numbers going up while i do almost nothing. Now, let's analyze the game a bit:

1. You are a mule for the cartel. You start small, dealing small and then you get dealers that deal for you while you sit around doing nothing.
2. There are some basic mechanics here and there: A) Mixing drugs, B) Lockpicking, C) Evading Police, D) Supposedly there are DEA dogs (?) which i haven't seen anywhere, even though i saw a tip about them on the loading screen somewhere, E) Spray painting, F) Planting Weed, G) Police Raids(which i never experienced, H) Risk Factor and Exposure meters 
3. The graphics are ugly, the faces are weird and there is literaly one police officer model in the entire game.
4. Annoying voice lines, annoying music and the f******g shady comm thing that everyone complains about is still in there.
5. Actual gameplay (?): You walk around, deal drugs, evade the police, paint the walls to keep the respect high and that's about it. You end up muling cocaine for the cartel at larger quantities to gain rep. I did that. I reached the 500 rep and the game just threw me another goal. Get all the houses and areas to own the ghetto. I haven't gotten to all the areas (left one for last) and I only had like 4 of the hideouts. In the final hour of the game, i laundered some money, bought all the houses and.... nothing happened. No achievement, no call from Eddie. Nothing. My whole progress seemed so empty at that point that i realized that the game won't get any better anytime soon and that i was done with it. 
6. All the money you earn will get you nothing. You might as well plaster the windows with them since everyone that passes in front of them can see the stacks of drugs on your table.
7. The things i like about the game? The logistics. The "" 100 gr of this and 120 gr of that. You take this, and you take that. Now give me my money"" It's kind of fun to evade the cops in the night but that quickly turns into a nuisance if you just stay in the shadows. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TL:DR & Ending sentiment: Deep as puddle and wide as a small lake. If you like numbers, the game is worth the money. You are lucky if you didn't get baited by the first trailer which had things that would never be part of this game. It feels like half an effort of a game and i doubt it will got far in matters of content.",1620518213,1620518213,False,3,0,0.5,2,True,False,False

The game is fun, at first you will be really excited and amazed at everything but after some time it just goes away, I'll explain:
1.- You have no purpose. Yes you are a dealer but other than moving drugs and avoiding the police the game doesn't has a purpose after 10-15 hours, less if you are really good.
2.- It gets repetitive. After a while you will start selling more and more drugs but it's the same in the end, it eventually feels like a ""job"" because you have to check the packaging, deliver the money and do all that stuff but times 10.
3.- It lacks content. It has a nice amount of content but it's still pretty shallow, there's no story, there's no development for your character, there's not map development. In short, after the 10th hour or so you'll already have seen everything the game has to offer.",1620393133,1620393133,False,10,0,0.585326015949249268,0,True,False,False

The idea behind the game is great, but the delivery is poor. 

Very little content. Poor optimization. The game can be categorized as an early access game despite the studio advertising it like a full-finish game. The main story is unfinished after more than a year.

If the game is $10 or less go for it.

Sure we got weed growing, but not like we were shown in the trailers. Not going to bang that drum though as plenty of other reviewers have made that point.

Ok, so why else am I now changing my review?
It's just not that fun.
Once I figured out the best routes to where you deal, those were the only parts of the level I saw.
And to repeat that ""the level"". One and only one level. No sneaking out to other parts of the city. No shipments to other places. Not even a sewer level. I can't believe this game made me type those words.

The quests are non optional, halt all other deals until you visit one of 2 gang leaders, and they want cocaine.
I don't sell cocaine, but does the asshat offering me this deal care? No, he wants a pile of coke asap.
However, as I have set up a dozen dealers and a few customers, all of whom are rocking my leading brand of speed called ""spid"" (It's an Eddie Izzard reference), all my money is tied up in deals and all my stock is amp.
I can't afford the coke I don't sell, and the dealers don't pay me back in time, so I fail the mission.
TLDR - missions are a badly coded joke.

Some people have pointed out the bugs. And there are more than a few.
I've seen windows not render, police chasing me only to do nothing when they get to me, all police congregating in one area like a doughnut convention, clipping through terrain, assets loading at the wrong scale (check out the baby dumpster screenshot I posted!) and many more to boot.

There are areas of the map that serve little to no purpose. The shanty town is deserted, the boarded up house is out of bounds, there are loads of buildings with nothing in them.

There is early access, but this is shipping the bare bones of a game.

However the entire point of this game is to hook you to the point where you've played 2+ hours, and as such can't refund it. Then the developers win because they got your money and you can't get it back. The developers have pushed back the release of updates several times, have clearly and blatantly lied about the reasons behind said delays, have contradicted each other multiple times regarding said lies, have released a misleading trailer (since removed from the Steam store, but can still be found on YouTube) to falsely advertise and sell the game, disappeared from the Steam forums for months and months on end, and censor anyone who dares to speak up, challenge them, or otherwise expose the truth.

The only content this game received after launch (until today) was growing weed. This feature was supposed to be in the game since launch according to the trailer that was since removed. That was WAAAAAAY back on May 27th. Nothing but graphics updates (which they CLAIM the community demanded, but we really didn't) and bug fixes since then. Even the weed update was pushed back for several weeks with zero explanation. No, we didn't demand the graphics be improved, they did that as a prelude to launching a console version of the game. Speaking of the newest update, it's garbage. One new store, a couple bug fixes, and a new faction that makes you go through a tedious scavenger hunt to join them that made me ragequit after 2 IRL hours of searching for random, unmarked dead drops that usually have nothing at all in them. Oh and the weed update is pretty much useless. A few levels after the ability to grow weed unlocks, you get access to cocaine, which is a far more profitable drug. Not to mention the weed plants look like house plants, NOT weed plants.

Don't even get me started on the optimization issues this game has. The 1.0.6 update from a few months ago completely broke the game for some people because the frame rate took a total nose-dive. Fortunately I could still play it, but I was getting around 30-40 FPS on average with an AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6-core processor @ 3.6 GHz, a GeForce GTX 1060 (6 GB), and 32 GB DDR4 RAM @ 2400 MHz. Why did this happen? Because the developer wanted the sky to look prettier and add rain, to pretty it up for a console release. However according to the developer, the community insisted they add these things, which is not true at all. They've also said that the 1.0.7 update completely ""fixes"" said optimization and frame rate issues. Uh I wouldn't call a 10 FPS increase ""fixed"" by any stretch of the imagination. Seriously, I went from 30-40 FPS on average (with dips down to 20 and very rare spikes up to 50) to 40-50 FPS on average, with dips down to 30 and very rare spikes up to 60 when I was playing the beta, which is 1.0.7. That's not ""fixed"", that's ""somewhat improved"" in my book. Oh and before you say ""well that frame rate is decent on your rig in 4k"" I play it in 2k, not 4k. Yeah, 30-40 FPS in 2k resolution, now up to 40-50 FPS in 2k resolution. That's ARK: Survival Evolved levels of optimization failure there. You know your game is utter crap in the optimization department when someone compares it to ARK.

What excuses have the developers given about the delay of the newest update? The marketing team needs footage for trailers that the community demanded (again, we didn't), there's still bug fixing going on (the Steam database depots page showed 1 update per week before December, nothing during December or the first part of January, then suddenly mid January 1 update per week again, so that's doubtful), the marketing team is waiting to advertise the update at the right time because it's too expensive to advertise right before Christmas (yet the update released late January, NOT early January), Cyberpunk 2077 is single-handedly breaking the investment market in the gaming industry (yeah right), and on and on. However, according to a DIFFERENT developer from Byterunners, NONE of what the previous developer said is true at all. So, they've contradicted each other and no one has the slightest clue what's going on in their company. Yet according to the developer that said none of that is true, they have great communication and their stories never change and they never contradict themselves. Yeah, right.

There was a trailer on the Steam store page up until a few days after launch that showed things like more immersive AI than are currently in the game, guns being in the game (which were at one point but were intentionally removed, never to be added back in, which I'm fine with but guns were still advertised), strippers, someone calling you to warn of a DEA raid, the ability to hit a bong, and more. None of that is actually in the game at all. False advertising at its finest.

Here's the YouTube trailer I'm referring to (you'll need to sign in to YouTube as it's age restricted) that proves their false advertising. This trailer was originally on the Steam store page for this scam game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV7j06tZzFY

Here it is on a DIFFERENT CHANNEL, which proves it's not someone trying to make Byterunners/MovieGames/PlayWay look bad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCc07rOVIE

And another one, on yet ANOTHER channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB3T6jlNI1c

The developers straight up VANISHED from the Steam forums for over 6 months. Complete radio silence. Full no-contact. Since then, ONE developer has come back to the forums about 2 weeks ago. Before that, not a word for 6 whole months. In that time, if you wanted information from the developers you had to join their Discord, which is even more tyrannical and cult-like than the forums. Excuse me, but I didn't buy the game on Discord, I bought it on Steam, so is it really so crazy of me to expect the developers to communicate here, where I bought the game? I shouldn't have to go on some third-party platform to get support and news for a game I bought on Steam.

Finally we come to the blatant CENSORSHIP from these crooked developers. I was just PERMANENTLY BANNED from the Drug Dealer Simulator Steam forums BY A DEVELOPER, NOT BY STEAM, for daring to speak the truth and call Byterunners out on their lies and everything else I mentioned. I did so in a mostly respectful manner, though I do admit to expressing a fair bit of frustration as well, hence the ""mostly respectful"" qualifier. I also poked massive holes in each and every one of the lies the developers have been feeding us using logic and reasoning, and they didn't like that. So, if you dare to question these developers or try to spread the TRUTH about them to counter their LIES, you'll get banned and censored for it.

So here's something fun about the whole censorship thing: A friend of mine was just banned for 30 days by the developers for saying/doing the EXACT SAME THINGS I SAID/DID. He even got a WARNING that NEXT TIME it would be permanent.

Bottom line: These developers are crooked, scamming criminals out to make a quick buck in a greedy cash grab. They don't care about their community or customers, AT ALL. They don't listen to their customers, AT ALL. They just do whatever they want and think that they're above the law and if you dare expose them you'll bruise their fragile little egos and they'll permanently ban you so you can't speak the truth anymore.

EDIT: I was just banned from the DDS Discord for, wait for it, SPEAKING THE TRUTH. I mentioned that I'd been banned from the Steam forums and that was censorship, admin came along, banned me, then DMed me to gloat and tell me that's not what censorship means and even lied to me, trying to accuse me of threatening to leak the beta password, something I NEVER did and wouldn't EVER do. He was very rude and argumentative the whole time, gloating and taking cheap shots at me like calling me a flat-Earther, etc. Even said I twisted a dev's words when I didn't.",1590413596,1618122555,False,1,0,0.516129016876220703,0,True,False,False

It's fun to play, and I've found myself mildly addicted (haha!), going back to it over and over again over the last week. This is not something I experience with a lot of games, and arguably this is all you can ask from a game. I tend to agree, which is why I'm recommending.

But good god is it messy. Everything is rough: 

- The writing. There are dozens and dozens of typos. When it's in texts it adds to the immersion. When it's in the UX, less so.
- The map design. What you can or cannot parkour off is a bit arbitrary. Prepare to get stuck against stuff pretty often, especially at night.
- The gameplay. The base gameplay loop is solid and fun, as I said. But some features make very little sense: there are two ""risk"" sliders, representing how visible your operation is to the authorities. They're both described in similar terms, and seem to work in the same way. Why two, then? What's the difference? Do they have different effects? Unclear. Also, reducing these meters is unintuitive: the main and most effective method is dealing at night. Note that it doesn't generate *less* visibility, which is what the in-game help implies: instead it effectively lower your *existing* visibility, meaning that you can go from enemy #1 to ghost in the machine by running around at night and dealing more drugs. A bit odd to say the least. 
- The QA: I had items duplicate in my inventory, notifications not syncing up, cops stopping the chase for no reason, all sorts of small issues. Nothing game breaking and no crashes though, so that's good.

Then there are mechanics that are a bit odd, but that I ended up liking. For example, a big feature is the ability to cut your drugs with additives, like salt, baking soda or ibuprofen. This is a cheap way to get more product, but some additives will change the properties of the drugs, making them more addictive or dangerous. But the game doesn't give you any kind of data on that. You have to experiment, making different mixes and keeping track of what seems to work (the only signals you'll get are your customer complaining if the quality is poor, if they get addicted, and if they OD or die). It's a bit disorienting (how am I supposed to know what works? Why would I ever use washing powder?), but it's actually pretty realistic (I'm guessing real world dealers don't get detailled trip reports from their users either), and it's a bold idea to put in place. I'm into it. (Also, I'm guessing all this info is available on the wikis anyway).

So yeah. It needs work, and more than new features it needs some bug fixing (and proofreading!), but the base experience is solid and the game is really fun already. Looking forward to seeing it evolve :)",1617919193,1617919193,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

THEY NEED TO ADD SHOOTING/COMBAT LIKE EVERYONE EXPECTED FROM THE VIDEOS OR ELSE IT'S JUST PACIFIST SIMULATOR
But I didn't refund the game. So at least I contribute to their continued development and I and some others will reverse our reviews and head up review reversal campaigns if the proper changes are made to this game. The main one being self defense and or weaponry being implemented because as it is, there is none. You can be tased by police, but you can't punch. When I get angry I like to punch in the game. Or kick, or shoot, or anything. You should be able to murder an npc and if they're not going to allow that at all then you should be able to at least punch a trash can or the wall or a cop.

I'm playing it. And I like some of the mechanics. I just don't recommend it because it's got no type of defensive attacks in this game. You don't have the ability to fight back when attacked or even simply kick a trash can. You can't have any weapons, you can't punch. Apparently you're pacifist runner man drug dealer. They hinted about changing that in the future and made a bullshit lame excuse about how even though it was in their original advertisement, it was just a concept and they changed the concept since then and hinted with a wink to stay tuned for changes. SO WHEN THEY ADD WEAPONS AND/OR SELF DEFENSE (no matter how useless against the supercops) Then I will change this review.

Again... I'm playing and haven't refunded it. But I spend a lot of time trying to evade cops and running away and loading the game again if they catch me, so you have to save frequently. The cops run after you. if they catch you then they taze you. there is no fighting back. And there is no melee. like you can't punch or get a taser or anything yourself. So it's running and selling drugs sim. And there is a cool system for processing, packaging, and cutting drugs. And people you sell drugs to have expectations on the form and purity of the drugs. I was like ahh i don't have enough coke to give to one of my dealers... i'll just cut it with heroin. LOL

So once they make some major changes to this game I will definitely change my review. I just can't recommend it to anyone I can think of now, because it will just frustrate them without guns even if they are willing to jump through all of the hoops you have to, to progress in this game and enjoy it's many features that are very slow to unlock. I understand they may have been trying to slowly unlock features so it's not too overwhelming for a player, but they could have simply given multiple game modes like other games do and often include custom settings when making a new game. etc.",1617305659,1617476894,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,1,True,False,False

I definitely got my money's worth with this game. I do wish there was more leniency with recipe experimentation. I also wish they added more chemistry into the game to allow for us to produce synthetics. The story line could use some love.

There isn't much to really motivate you to make you want to progress though. Just deal different drugs and dealing them at a higher quantity. Devs should consider implementing more things to do. Something with guns, cars, maybe conflict with other gangs/dealers or even trying to take down the leader of your own gang to run it yourself.

[u][b]Secondly[/b][/u], this is one of the very few games from the cash grab PlayWay games are usually that's actually worth playing. ByteRunners did a surprisingly decent job.
Before purchasing the game through Steam, i've played nearly 60hrs outside of Steam, and have accompanied all of the Development stages from the day it released, having played the Prologue and Pre-Release Builds.
So, i have a pretty good idea of how the game has played, and what updates have solved and added.

[u][b]That said[/b][/u], where i think ByteRunners hit almost bang on was the progression. The feel you get at the start while acting as ""The Cartel's"" most recent addition to their Drug distribution ring, is as every little bit of cash matters but it all also disappears when Eddie asks for the Quota of all your orders. At the start you barely get profit over the Quota of your drug orders, but that little profit keeps climbing slowly along with your level in a very balanced way. At level 15/16 you surpass the 1000xp mark by making deliveries or grabbing the cash from your dealers. Every client can become a dealer if they like the product and buy regularly. That will then, net you even bigger profit. Clients and Dealers both order drugs by different names making them seem more like an actual person and not a bot (though the Client messages can get repetitive most of the time).

[u][b]The Checkpoint crossings[/b][/u] are a pretty interesting subject, since you were able to pass them by approaching the barriers, throwing your duffle bag/backpack to the other side, letting the TRAP Officer search you and grabbing the bag afterwards. This was proof that the mechanics of this game work but not quite at the same time.
This, however, was fixed (or prevented should i say) in the 26th Feb. Update, an area around the checkpoints was added in which the player is not allowed to drop or pickup any backpack which leads me to my next point.

[u][b]Even after being fully released[/b][/u], ByteRunners are still updating the game with new content which is great seeing as this game is pretty unique both in gameplay and content and has pretty good potential to expand.

[u][b]The Gameplay[/b][/u] is pretty unique and overall pretty polished, yeah the stereotypical PlayWay scripted animations are present (for example, when jumping above walls), but that's the only thing really. Textures are all pretty much new as well as the character models, and the map might have some assets from other PlayWay trash, but i haven't noticed so i cannot comment on that.

[u][b]The Soundscape[/b][/u], as a Sound Modder and Audiophile, let me tell you that the Soundscape of the Ghetto is overall pretty unique and of decent quality, various buildings have music jumping out from the windows at various volumes and different music plays from different buildings, all within the Hip Hop/Rap and Techno Genres though.
[u][b]How's the voice acting i hear you asking?[/b][/u] The Voice Acting alone is nothing special but the people they chose to do the voice overs really do suit the game's grittiness and characters. I'm kind of a fan.

I won't get into more detail, but you can grow your own and make your own mixes to sell at a bigger price or to give away as samples to addict random bystanders into becoming your clients.

Overall, it's a solid 7.5/10. I'm still having fun and i'm only halfway through the game. If it's on sale, it's worth getting.
Thanks ByteRunners and keep the updates coming.",1616352013,1616352382,True,1,0,0.484233587980270386,0,True,False,False

The game has you playing in a near-future Californian ""immigrant neighbourhood"" (polite term to say walled-off part of a city full of immigrants) as a, at first, low-level drug dealer, and this part of the game is actually well represented IMO.

The gameplay is focused on stealth. There are no guns, no weapons. While this may seem strange for a game about dealing drugs and doing business with cartels and the mafia, it makes sense in this game. You are an immigrant, in a state that CLEARLY doesn't want you (hence the walls to keep you in), and should one of the people in the neighbourhood starts shooting at the cops, it wouldn't take long that they'd kick in every single door in there to find the one with the gun and deport them. So, if you want a game where you can be a criminal and shoot a big gun about it, this isn't for you. Go get Payday 2.

The drug mixing aspect of the game is more elaborate than I was expecting, but voluntarily lacking information. As the ingame tutorial says, you have to go with trial and error... Or look in the steam discussion, or the wiki. But, while the game allows you to mix basically anything with anything, and as so reach some incredibly complex recipes, mixing is in no way necessary. It only allows to get more addicts from substances that aren't very addictive (namely weed, amp and ecstasy), or lower toxicity, and so reduce deaths by overdose, of more dangerous substances (like cocaine, heroin and meth). So, if you don't like trial-and-error, and if you prefer a no-brainer, either skip the mixing, stay on simple recipes, or skip the game entirely (hopefully not only for this)

The game now allows you to grow weed yourself, to sell or mix with other stuff. Problem with this is the level at which it unlocks. It unlocks only 1 level away from cocaine, with cocaine being the second to last sell-able drug available. By the time you reach it, you'll either skip growing weed, or mix it with other stuff to make it addictive.

Police raids. Yep. Police raids. Honestly, I didn't expect this one. First thing to know: your initial apartment is basically a sanctuary. No cops can come in, you cannot lose it, cannot lose the stuff in it either. Nothing bad can happen there, and if you keep away from mixing, it may end up being all that you need. Ever. But, if you get into mixing, you'll quickly run out of space. So you can buy another place, which you can customise. BUT! If you do too many deals, if you're too suspicious, you may walk by a car you never saw before, right by your new place, and walk up to a locked door. You open it, only to have a message that says ""Raid in XX seconds!"" And that's only the MAXIMUM time. So you pick up what you can, and jump out the window, with flashbangs and smokes going off, and you running from the cops.

And now... The cons.

First, and possibly most critical point... The communication from the dev team. Up until 2021, the communication from the devs were basically non-existent. Last news of 2020 (other than the dec 30th one) was on october 29th, for halloween. The halloween deco stayed until the January patch. Before that, it was another several months. BUT! In 2021, they actually admitted that they should have communicated more, and that there was no excuse for their silence. Since then, they released 2 updates, one in January, one in February. Maybe March will see another one, I sure hope so.

Second, and also a very requested point that the devs still haven't worked on (as far as I know) is that the story just ends at some point, with no indication as such. You start dealing with the gangs, and that's it. They will order more and more, infinitely, This may have changed in the most recent updates, I am not 100% sure, but I haven't seen it in the patch notes. Instead, they have added a third gang, this one dealing with weed. BUT this gang comes with the addition of LSD, which I still haven't tested in the game.

Finally, bugs. While they are not as common as last year, there are still a few. Also, not exactly sure at which point last year, but the textures for a lot of people went from normal to 1990's low-res. Like... Doom had better graphics. We had to wait for the halloween update for a fix, and then got stuck with the halloween deco for months!

TL;DR: I VERY cautiously recommend the game. While it is out of early access, there are still a lot of unfinished stuff, a lot of potential, and the coming months will truly determine if the devs have what it takes to make this game into the masterpiece it can be, or if it will be abandoned, like so many other early access games.",1616214056,1616214056,True,35,0,0.753650009632110596,5,True,False,False

I started playing Among Us chiefly do the huge amount of requests I got from friends and viewers to check it out. And I'm glad I did. It's a great party game. It's a game where you get together with friends, and have a big WHODUNIT match, very much like an interactive board game, but better. It's a LOT of fun, when you have people to play with.

However, you have to understand that Among Us is simply that. A casual, party game meant to be played with friends. It's not a game that requires a great amount of skill, just the ability to be a detective, and see through people's lies. Or, when you are the imposter, it requires you to be an excellent liar. It's definitely a game worth playing, but it isn't a game that you should take and replace your life with.

The core gameplay loop does get boring relatively quickly, because there is nothing to work towards, nor does it have any real progression mechanics. It simply exists as a fun, round-by-round type game. Nothing more, and nothing less.

Why do I recommend against buying it? Only because the mobile version exists. The PC version is just the mobile port, but while the mobile version is free-to-play, the PC version is $5 normally, or $4 on sale.

I suggest that if you to play Among Us, that you save your money, download the BlueStacks Android emulator, and play it on there for free instead. That's what I wish I did.

I bought this game the day it was made available for purchase on the steam store, finished what they had already created as the storyline. i have now come back to see that not much has changed apart from small bug fixes and a little customisation. 

PROS
- Incredibly fun and easy to learn controls and mechanics.
- Great difficulty settings, perfect for people who want a challenge.
- You are able to take many paths of which drugs to sell and not sell, using the laptop, you can 'stop selling' specific drugs and focus on a smaller group.
- Good experimentation opportunities.
- Awesome risk taking opportunities.
- Can take many pathways of your drug dealing career.

CONS
- Infrequent update cycle.
- Hard to come back to and pick up where you left off
- Unfinished story 
- Minor bugs
- Can be repetitive

Overall, a good game to buy if youre looking for 25-50 hours of playtime, a fun game, large potential for future updates. However the game feels very repetitive and sometimes feels boring as you seem to be doing the same thing day in day out.",1615452898,1615452898,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After that, the game becomes a pretty straightforward logistics simulator, in which you buy, adulterate, stockpile, and sell drugs as efficiently as you can. 

The game play gets pretty stagnant at this point, and I think it's pretty much impossible to have a decent reputation in more than like 3-4 zones at once without becoming significantly more visible to cops/DEA; I've never had a drug raid, but apparently that can happen if your ""exposition"" is too high -- I'm pretty sure the word ""exposure"" would be more appropriate here, but this game is absolutely RIFE with spelling and grammar errors, which I find kind of ridiculous for how long it's been in development. Having no experience in game design, I assumed spelling errors would probably be the single easiest thing to fix, but apparently that is either not the case, or the devs of this game just straight up don't want to bother. It doesn't necessarily interfere with game play too much, but it makes you wonder why you spent $20 on this game every time you check how many ""dolars"" you have in your inventory. 

All that said, I frequently found myself checking the time while playing this and thinking ""holy shit how is it 2:30 am already?"". Much like a traditional drug addiction, this game is capable of consuming A LOT of your time if you let it. If you enjoy simulator games and want to experience what it's like to be a low-rent El Chapo, I would recommend picking this up on sale. The sense of progression is good while it lasts, and the options for mixing and adulterating drugs is surprisingly fun to experiment with, although slightly janky at times. Just remember that you will probably (and most likely suddenly) reach a point at which you will lose interest, as there is no end game I have found (this is a simulator, after all).",1615233045,1615233045,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Instead, updates consist of adding more drugs, even though the ones we have are sufficent to make more money than can be spent. Or arbitrary changes to systems that don't need to be changed, like the pack system. This is stuff you tweak after the main game's done, not before adding end game content.

Sadly, the combination of mostly positive reviews, lack of EA status, and the random acts of development says to me that we'll probably never see this game reach a state of feature completeness. Financially, I'm sure it's been a success for the devs and publisher, but will probably remain kind of a let down for players who played for more than a few hours.

It's one of those situations where we can all see the game has almost limitless potential, but probably won't ever come close to reaching it.

Even though the early game's great, the total lack of end game content is the reason I'm giving this one a thumbs down. Sorry, but I can't recommend half a game.",1614979838,1614979838,False,8,0,0.555305600166320801,0,True,False,False

Other than there needing to be more content, my only other complaint is with the police. Completely broken. Either oblivious to the point of absurdity, or they're regularly tazing me inside my hideouts despite me being away from the door and the door itself being closed. Also an issue with the border police regularly searching you twice within seconds of the last search while passing through the wall. Along with the way that they respond to your character running, if they decide to search you while you're passing by in mid-sprint you're completely fucked. For whatever reason the game decided that running, period, during any stage of the search results in an immediate chase and taze. Not a HUGE problem when there's only two groups patrolling, but later in the game when you're gonna have typically several groups patrolling it becomes a massive problem. When even a trip to the ATM results in every single police crew in the area going after you because one of them decided they wanted to randomly search you while you're trying to sprint to your destination. Even better when you're trying to mule drugs between your hideouts when it happens, causing you not only a fine but also losing all the product you had on you, and potentially pissing off any customers who were waiting on you if you were delivering. Also, the mix quality needs to be made more user-friendly. I can get the realism aspect, but inadvertently pissing off a gang or your customers with low quality mixes, or even inadvertently killing them, because you have absolutely zero way to verify quality even though every gang and customer has quality demands, doesn't make any sense. Along with potentially having you accidentally waste a significant amount of pure product. I also see there are several mixes I found online that require MJ to be used in them, the problem though is there is absolutely zero way to incorporate it in any form in any mix because none of the equipment accepts it except the liquid trays and dryers, which is fine and well but the result can't be used in any mixer or miller because none of them accept plant matter. 

Add more content. Fix the police. They're useless at best and an absolutely pointless nuisance at worst. If MJ needs to be used in certain mixes make it so we can actually USE it in mixes in that case. And have some way or form of at least being able to tell if the quality of a mix is acceptable, preferably with a way to tell strength and toxicity as well seeing how they're so important to the mix and the results. 3 stars for now, if those problems are ever fixed then it's a definite 5 stars",1614566715,1614566715,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

DDS is an interesting twist on the 'time killer' genre of repeating tasks millions of times but keeping it fun all the while. 
The game has seen a bunch of added content since launch, but still suffers from some of the balancing issues present since then as well. 
There is now a bit more storyline and gang activity is increased, however it's still fairly short lived with limited rewards for the effort. But it breaks up the routine of ordering, cutting, packaging, and delivering that becomes your life in DDS. 
The map is still pretty small which is great for making door dashes a breeze, but with only a few streets and active buildings in the game, you will get fairly tired of the same route around the map. As you progress in skills and open a couple new hideouts, simply running from the cops becomes easier than stealth. It does raise your suspicion level but for most of the game it matters very little. For the most part just running around saves time and you are no worse for it than sneaking about. 
Unlocking new drugs and items is a nice progression but a bit unbalanced. By the time you can grow weed, it's likely you are not even selling it anymore. Also, you grow so much weed with a small space that a couple indoor plants or a few outdoor ones is all you'll ever need. Expanding to a gigantic pot operation doesn't really pay off since you don't become the cartel's pot supplier. 
Other drugs like Ecstasy also unlocks around the time that once you have all the gear needed to cut it and put it back in pill form- it's not a profitable product anyway. Fun for RP reasons or just to play mad scientist with mixes, but it's pretty much going out of your way to bother with it. Only Cocaine and Meth matter for the gang content. Heroin comes late but is one of the best drugs for getting addicts. 
The game has several interesting concepts in play. One being that getting addicts is good as they order larger amounts but bad in that they tend to die from OD which hurts your reputation. Many people create a different mix for before and after a client becomes addicted. Some of your clients will offer to be dealers under you, which is a big step up in sales but adds a second meeting to later collect money. You can rent (it's actually a one time purchase) hideouts around town to move operations to, use to hide from cops, and save the game from. Each of these further increases reputation or adds clients to the pool. However each area is increasingly more difficult to access. 
There is some weirdness in packaging amounts and losing some product to processing. So after processing loss you may have fractions of a gram left over- but no way to package anything under 1g nor with any fraction attached. In some lab gear you will have to 'dump' the excess to use the equipment again-- meaning losing some small amount each time. It's just a clunky system. 
Police searches are constant, which is why I say it's just easier to skill up running and stamina, and just run from the cops. Police can sniff you out from long distances sometimes, and other times I run full sprint right past them and they don't notice me. Stealth seems a bit broken, but hoofin' it works every time. 
The game is great for those that want to play Walter White and mix up custom batches of drugs. There are online guides for the hard numbers. There is an element of RNG though, so you can still see OD's from 'safe' mixes found in guides. There is a selection of furniture and lab gear but for the most part you don't need to have labs all over the place. The map is small enough that you can operate from basically two HQ buildings, one on each side of the wall and mandatory police searches. I recommend using single floor rentals because running up and down stairs takes a ton of your time. 
You need to be able to listen for police radios so you don't stumble around a corner into a patrol, but otherwise there isn't much to listen to in the game. Voice acting is good, but very sparse. 
Not much replayability value except to run for different gang content, but the core of the game is repetitious enough, other than for RP purposes, there isn't much fun in re-playing those early levels. 
I have a ton of fun with this game. It's expanding so there is much more to do now than when it launched. Hope it keeps getting love.

► Now for a Normal Review...

First off i would like to state that i found out about the game from a YT video, i downloaded the demo, got fixated and then bought the game.

Now, let's make clear that this game is -in my opinion- still on development and that is something really good considering what we have and the potential of it!

We are talking about a First Person Perspective Drug Dealer Simulator as the title states and it is really fun to play. If you like it, it gets you feeling that you exist as the game character and you have to deliver the goods on time to benefit of a good rating by the clients.

► Game starts and then...

You wake up in your apartment after you got fired from your job and get a phone call from Eddie. The guy that is your connection with the cartel. You get to meet up with him and he gives you the basics of the game.

After that the learning begins.

The game does a really good job on teaching you what to do in the begining, and to get you going by giving you tasks to complete just to unlock drugs and neighborhoods to sell products. 

As the game progresses, you can rent multiple apartments to use as stash places and secondary bases just to avoid getting caught on a neighborhood with loads of stuff on you going on a delivery.

You have to constantly be in the move and organize a lot, just to start making money. The catch is that you have to push product not only on the daylight hours, but more at night without getting caught by the police. If you move in the morning your Drug Dealer wanted status is going to bring more police in the areas that you are selling, risking more searches, more difficult movement between parts of the town and the worst... a DEA raid. So time management and careful planing of your moves is really essential.

That game even got me anxious as i was moving product at night during ""Police Hours"" that normally citizens are prohibited from circulation. Something like the quarantine limitations!!!

Also after you get the basics you can mix random ingredients that you are buying on shops with the drugs to ""cook"" them and get more profit!

In my opinion it is a really good game that with our help the developer(s) can polish and bring more and more things in it! For example, sleeping schedule, better neighborhood design, some ""hidden"" perks to have the knowledge on mixing and baking, the potential of the player growing plants to create something, e.g. MJ, normal prices on the sales (e.g. 25 bucks for a spray can???) etc...

The game is really good, stable without any glitches that i have experienced. I hope that the devs are going to continue creating!

P.S. For the guy that wrote a review about the game not working.... Dude... Learn how to use PCs... Just Saying!

I've had this game since it came out essentially.  Watched the first couple of live streams too.

When the game launched, you could play it, sure, but it got tedious and buggy. 
There was suspicion that this was done on purpose as to release an almost finished game and buy time to develop content.
The end result is probably a little of A and B.

But check it out, the game runs reasonable FPS now and I think I have had one CTD instead of GB-bugs every hour or so. 
The game play progression is filled with new features for quite a while now, instead of having three or four major gaps between features, it seems the biggest one is for this new gang feature @ 500 respect.

Cannabis growing is finally in, and I'm glad they didn't try to push it while it was broken.

Repair policemen mechanics, because it is just so annoying when you go to sector B and you gotta go through the ""check"" twice (if you are lazy ass like me). The exposure level is a little bit too much sensitive in the late game.

You have a lot to experiment with, optimize and make your routes better, enjoy running away from police officers. But once you reached a certain level, there is nothing apart from a running simulator. Police is very easy to outrun once you reached a certain stamina and speed levels, interaction with the clients is very scarce (again, no content). Same locations, music is the same in the buildings it is coming from (again, no content). 

You can experiment with different mixtures but community website managed to break the meta at early stages which makes your game at maximum efficiency with little or no thinking, unless you want to invent a bike (again, no content). 

I see little point responding to buyers unless they are dealers with huge requests as it makes little or no money for you but you have to mix drugs a lot. 

Only if you want to make a picture of how much stuff you have and show off, you can enjoy this game as long as you want but as continuous experience - boring as hell. 

VERY IMPORTANT. HARTY PARD update been in final check since 30th of December. Now we are in mid Feb and update was not launched yet. Only if you enjoy watching teaser on repeat like some drug addicts in Market area playing the same music, you may actually get the promised content. 

Great idea - poor execution. Poor management, poor priorities, little content and they are printing new games instead of finishing up the old ones and making it actually playable. 

It makes the whole developers team poor. And every time I see PlayWay S.A. I am staying away because of their game development history. That is unfortunate.

Gameplay is kinda slow and grindy at the start but once you start making more money, it actually gets more fun. Ok, it gets repetitive after a while but luckily there are some side quests you can do.

And you can mix your own drugs, just for fun or in the worst case to kill people :p Don't take the game to serious :)

Don't forget about this ridiculous atrocity of a joke about the Steam Award for Best Music while they only thing they were doing is making people win keys for games**

This was a huge f uck up from the start. People like myself were complaining about HUGE issues related to game progress (meaning we couldn't progress) while they were doing the dev live stream, such as not being able to unlock an area despite the fact they all are unlocked, problems with gang missions, items advertised that were not in the pharmacy shop, etc. Their answer:

""Well, it's suppose to be fixed in the patch.""

Yeah well there's at least 10 people saying that it's not working, the numbers went up. Same excuses : 

""Well, it's suppose to be okay with the patch."". 

This is the answer of a lazy ♥♥♥ husband when his wife ask if he took the trash out. Add to injury, they say: 

""Well we're just a small team of developer and since it's not even a big issue...OH BY THE WAY HERE'S FREE CD KEYS!!"". 

Then if you don't have enough content and time to check the bugs, why did you released it??
Turned out they did fix it but this refusal to even acknowledge the problems at first is ridiculous AND their I-don't-give-a-♥♥♥♥-about-your-progress,

Then we asked if we have to start a new game to make the patch work, because lots of us were lvl 40+. The devs's answer: ""hmmm yeah maybe you should"". That's it? 50h for nothing because we were stuck. Oh but no worries, here's more cd keys ;)

This game was broken from start and it's still broken. It wasn't even early access when it came out and it should have been. This is a fetch and running simulator with lack of contents because once you reach cocaine and you know how to mix this is the only thing left to do that's worth lots of money. It gets old pretty quick. Even before the first few patches, once you reach 500 XP with the gang, you are suppose to unlock new features. NOPE. Nothing. Nada. Rien. It gives a mission to unlock all areas and dominate the hood, which is pretty much done with my respect full everywhere but it doesn't say it's complete to give me new objectives.

No really, don't buy this game. Wait for a decade or something before they make more contents and stop doing this cd keys crap. You'll invest time in this game and you'll be stuck to wait for a patch because you can't progress. Imagine if in GTA or in any AAA game, you'll have to wait for a week for an update to make you able to progress story mode or a campaign. But meanwhile, the dev offers cd keys if you send them pictures of your dog taking a shit on your grandma's head. Of course it's not a AAA game, needless to say it won't be.",1589399390,1612313445,False,9,1,0.535308301448822021,1,True,False,False

Then, they decide that they only want to update the game in a significant way every 6 months, and even then the updates are usually broken or unbalanced and end up serving more like a useless DLC.

The game is not nearly as buggy as it used to be, but they still end up annoying you from time to time. They are okay at patching these things but unfortunately patches are about the only updates you get from this game. The devs sort of ""hibernate"" for 4-6 months, then promise a huge update, and then release a mediocre version of what they promised another month later. 

This game feels like it should be in early access. I feel like what the developers did here was prevent the early access tag because of its bad reputation as of lately. This game simply is not complete. The developers have a road-map that anyone can look up, which is kind of strange considering this game is being sold as a COMPLETE GAME. However, these are just my theories, I could be totally wrong.

It presents plenty of challenges as well as a fun and detailed map with a number of great songs that are now on my spotify playlist. It is also interesting getting high on coke and getting $4000 worth of heroin stolen from me by the DEA. The only two things I really have against this game is that there are a few annoying glitches and even if you have the latest, greatest and most powerful GPU on the market, you will still only be able to run a max of 30fps on full graphics. Because all I have is a GeForce GTS 450 and an Intel Core 2 Quad (please don't judge me :P), I can only get playable frame rates at potato quality graphics. Other than that, me and one of my friends have gotten huge amounts of fun out of this game being able to do illegal things without the police on us. I would rate it 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Edit: I got a new GPU (RTX 2060) and CPU (Intel i5 10th gen) so the game runs way better. It also helps that the 'Harty Pard' update reduces impact on hardware, meaning that my Acer Nitro 5 won't explode every time I play.

Whereas, it does seem remarkably Polish: this is a real game, and real effort was put into it. 

The gameplay mechanics do a good job of replicating what I assume dealers would have to problem-solve. Quickly measuring out the right amounts of product into the right number of bags, avoiding paper trails by only using cash and laundering your ATM transactions, and even anticipating losing yields during chemistry, if you start manufacturing. 

The developers care about this game, you can tell. The voice acting is actually decent, there are splash images and a leveling/difficulty progression that was carefully tuned, and I haven't seen any real bugs. I will say, that the translation has some oofs: almost every line has a typo or a misspelled word.

Now let me get started, this game is low quality for the price they normally ask for.

Low quality textures, small map, repetetive gameplay and poor UI & optimisation.

Often there's spelling mistakes in loading screen tips, subtitles and general dialogue.

The police seem to already know where you are and think 10 steps ahead of you, so be prepared to get arrested a lot. If you're lucky then throw your backpack and even if the police are right behind you they'll ignore it.... A bag full of drugs.... so you can go back and pick it up after.

The premise is dealing drugs, theres a reasonably good marketing aspect to the game. Controlling the price you sell, using perks to get better prices etc etc.

To progress properly you really need to grind hard in the game and in such a small map this really makes the gameplay boring.

Even being out during ""police hours"" at night (a lockdown time where if you're out you get arrested) isn't exciting. You dont feel compelled to take the risk as there's very little reward in terms of xp.

The game is fun though. i spent three hours on it from the moment i downloaded it and its fun. It feels clunky in parts and the UI for mixing drugs etc needs a lot of work which i doubt it'll get.

But if you seriously want to buy this, don't spend more than £6 on it. It isn't worth your money if you're paying more than that. 

There's some funny dialogue with in jokes about other games the devs have worked on like thief simulator and that was surprising. The narrator is very well scripted and you do learn a fair bit about getting everything up and running and what it takes to run a drug business.

Overall its a standard game with low resolution physics, repetetive gameplay and poor effort in quality of mechanics and variation of gameplay.

But there's something loveable about it. i stll go onto it and play every now and then. accept drug orders, pick up the dead drops and pay the cartel my debts.

My first problem is that when i tried it for free on an old laptop in the summer it delivered the same experience in terms of fps. Its ridiculous. The hardware you need to run it is just a joke compared to how the game looks like.

Graphics settings make no difference AT ALL. The game doesnt look very different on full low settings. No matter how low it is, i dont get a much higher fps either.

Another problem is that you cannot save in the first 30 minutes. After 3 deliveries all my progress was lost because i restarted the game to change the graphics settings.

This game is not optimazed at all but it does deliver a nice experience.

You play the roll of a drug dealer, gradually building your network of clients and even other dealers to sell throughout the city. You unlock a variety of drugs and ways to mix them as time goes on to create more addictive or potent blends. 

(Spoilers below)

Progression is absolutely bizarre and needs to be redone. You start the game with Weed and Amphetamines and quickly unlock meth and Ecstasy in early game. Heres the issue, you can only mix amphetamines early on, you need expensive equipment that you unlock hours later to mix the others. So you might as well only sell amphetamine until mid game because with mixing you can up your margins 20-30%. Even worse you unlock the advanced machinery right around the time you unlock cocaine. Cocaine has insane margins and is easily mixed, at that point in the game there is no reason to sell anything else. Late game you unlock the ability to grow weed, which is cool but why would you ever want to go back to weed when you are already printing money with cocaine. So a pro tip to deal with the awful balance, make yourself stock and sell every drug, this way the economy won't be trivially easy. With all that said i do still recommend it, it is very fun even if a bit too easy.
