I'd label this game ""middle of the road"" something to get when it's on sale. At it's core, Dead Island isn't a bad game, but it's definitely showing its age. it's a game that consists of fetch quests from point A to point B in the most absolute mundane way possible. The gameplay loop just isn't fun and it's very outdated. the zombie encounters are very repetitive and they offer very little strategy, apart from just bashing it or throwing things at it. Weapons feel very clunky and the motion blur is horrendous. nothing sets weapons apart and they all feel clunky and the same with very little nuance. this is a game that I WOULD recommend, but only if it's on sale.

PROS
-Beautiful graphics that aged nicely
-5 characters to choose from with unique strengths
-Soundtrack is serene (albeit unfitting for an apocalypse.)
-Price is usually dirt cheap on sales
-the physics are very good
-weapon upgrade system that allows for creative choices.

CONS
-Repetitive gameplay that devolves into nothing but glorified fetch quests.
-Weapons feel bad, especially guns that have terrible sway
-The skill tree is very bad, with most skills not even directly applying to the character that you choose, but you're forced to buy them anyway to advance to the next tier.
-Looter shooter aspects, weapons are color coded and have grades. If you aren't a fan of that and you have ADHD or OCD, it will drive you crazy.

It's a mid game and that's okay, nothing spectacular but nothing egregious. it's a solid 5/10, pick up on sale.",1708971702,1708971702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every character breathes life into the story with their dead eyes and emotionless face, rivaling even something like Red Dead Redemption 2. They make nonsensical decisions in a cutscene that was activated by them walking through one door and into a room full of people who they just met. With Sam B screaming about the voodoo night of the living dead shit currently going down, Purna talking about helping people and then shooting random people she just met, Logan not knowing which accent he should use throughout the game, and Xian sitting in the corner never speaking. The main characters are really just carrying the whole game story on their back. While also allowing you to empathize and relate with their moral compass, as well as understand their thought process.
The side characters really pull their weight as they tell you to grab them 5 flowers in a monotone voice. They tell their daughters to remember them how they are now, as they both violently stare open eyed into each others faces. With one making noises that could be compared to crying but without the proper facial animations, you'll never really know. 
The music blares in your speakers or headphones with the most over the top sad tones you could imagine. As you think of the stock music site that they probably stole it from, you're being told to go help Frank find his wife. Who is two bungalows over begging for more and more alcohol. 
The gameplay is absolutely stunning. There's never a moment in which you're fighting zombies where you're enjoying yourself. Either you're swiping cobwebs from your faces, or you're blasting at other survivors with your pistol with the auto aim function which they transferred onto PC for some reason. The guns feel like you're shooting people with rubber bullets, whether it's a human or a zombie. Either way you're doing at most, like 10 damage. Same goes for the weapons, with every enemy taking up to 10 hits with a machete. You're never going to get bored of fighting in this game. You'll probably just get fed up and run through as many as you possibly can.
And the graphics.. MAMA MIA. They need to go back into the oven because they are not fucking done.

All in all it has a little something for everyone. Without ever having a moment where you're free from bugs, you'll always be having fun. 10/10, best game I've played in the last 5 years. I want my money back.",1615185887,1708891902,True,1,7,0.494809657335281372,0,True,False,False

So, Dead Island pulls out all of the ""Zombie Apocalypse"" stereotypes including
-Idyllic island beach resort
-people being immune to zombie virus
-secret military base on beach island that creates the virus
-the fight between the main characters and looters, pillagers, and rioters
-insane reaction between military and said virus even though they created the virus
-indigenous people being able to ""control"" said virus
-the one person you least expect to die/hope for the best for them dies horribly.

That is why I call it cheesy, and I admit even though I usually hate these kind of things it was entertaining for me

A decent little Weapon Crafting system and some decent areas to explore.

To say its open world is a bet far fetched as these are different areas you can move to and progress through the story.

The story as far as it goes again is ""ok"" didn't personally grip me rather than the progressive side quests and such that I actually enjoyed more so. 

There were a few parts I found buggy and the npc system is a bit off putting as alot of the time characters on escort missions will simply run off whilst your trying to keep them safe and kill the straggling zombies at the same time.

In all its good fun with friends and even playing solo its all good, the character building and progression was more interesting than the actual story line

This game works nearly the same as borderlands but without the cool loot part of the game and comedy. The story doesn't actually mean anything and neither does 90% of dialogue. The combat is also annoying, with you having no choice but to lose health by getting hit on those tall zombies. 

If you want to play the game solo, then don't expect much as this game is more made for co-op, which I did not expect. It makes the game 10x harder than usual, so if you don't have friends to play the game with, then don't buy this game as you'll find yourself quitting early.

You bet that most of the missions are worthless missions making you grab something for someone or one of those typical rescue missions that are stupid and everyone hates.

Overall, try it out if you have 2-4 people to play with. If you don't, the game is very frustrating and gets very very boring. Kind of unfortunate because the atmosphere can be cool as well as the zombies sometimes actually being scary.

 Honestly, the main draw to this game for me was nostalgia watching Youtubers play it back around 2011, and the unique tropical island theme (which slowly falls off after the first beach level). The story was super forgettable, I played it to the end solo, but it was pretty mediocre. The settings were cool, and the combat was simple but fair given the initial release date. Once you find a gun, it really shows its age. It’s pretty janky all things considered.

If you have no nostalgia for Dead Island, I think your time/money is better off with another game. Otherwise, I say consider buying on a sale because by the end of the game, I was getting tired of the gameplay loop and sub-par performance that I didn’t want to sit through the Riptide sequel.",1706363431,1706363952,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

More thoroughly thoughts: Overall, a downgrade....

Huge performance hog noticeable even on a vastly superior computer than the one I've played Classic

Chairs and every other prop that went flying with kicks, explosions and whatever are now ""ghost"" props... meh.

EVERY NPC used to talk something as the quests and rep went on, but now they are just dumb manequins.

The minimap seems inferior, is somewhat buggy, and it is no longer possible to keep NORTH UP. Its pathing is also buggier and will disappear more frenquelty (IE, player/quest pathing is buggier)

POSITIVE ASPECT - The game no longer tries to make us a drunk by putting any Alcohol we pick directly on hand slot. That on itself is almost a sole positiving reason

I just recently started playing this over Classic to see if the game has actually improved its endgame/postgame on Riptide. If yes, I'll positive this and Riptide. If no, then this is a real serious downgrade over the original games!

POSITIVED: Why? Even being a DOWNGRADE from Dead Island classic, this game is still a masterpiece and amongst the top 5 Zombie games ever made...",1705616878,1705689798,True,17,0,0.681673407554626465,0,True,False,False

The melee weapons degrade quickly but luckily there are workbenches scattered throughout levels to repair your gear. Co-op is fun especially if you have friends to play with. It can get a little challenging with one person.

[h1]""Welcome to Paradise.""[/h1]

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
By far the first Zombie game that I liked that changed the entire Zombie genre for me. Before Dead Island, there were so many different Zombies games but none of them had long playability or longevity of any kind, as in you would play it once and then forget about it and maybe replay it in a few years if you get nostalgic enough. 

But Dead Island was different from the beginning. I picked it up years ago on a sale for the Xbox 360 and the amount of fun I had was unlike any other for a zombie game. Now that I got to revisit it years later I can tell you that the game still holds up today. Sure there are better zombie games like Dying Light for an instance. [b](Made by the same developers.)[/b] But the game is still loads of fun if you pick it up for a cheap price. 

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
4 people from four different backgrounds find themselves on Banoi Island. An island country inspired by Papua New Guinea. When the outbreak begins by unknown methods those 4 people find themselves to be immune to the virus and they band together hoping for a way off the island. [b](I know this sounds really basic but trust me this game doesn't really have a good story, to begin with. It's the gameplay that defines it.)[/b]

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
● 4 player CO-OP
● Loads of Zombies everywhere
● Steam trading cards
● Steam Achievements
● Lite RPG mechanics
● 4 unique player characters [b]~ Sam B, Logan, Xian Mei, and Purna. They all have unique playstyles and preferences.[/b]

● Unique zombies [b]~ Thug, Ram, and Butcher just to name a few, I will let you figure out what they do or what they look like.[/b]

● Graphics [b]~ They still hold up today and even more so if you can get a ReShade on your hands.[/b]

● Gameplay [b]~ It's not as great as Dying Light per se but it still holds up today and it is fun nonetheless[/b]

● Gore & Ragdoll system [b]~ You can hack off limbs, break bones and send enemies flying with the awesome gore and ragdoll system Dead Island has.[/b]

● Weapons [b]~ From the firearms to the melee weapons. Dead Island strived for having a really good melee system. There are tons of bladed, blunt, unarmed and other types of weapons featured.[/b]

● Various locations [b]~ From the paradise island itself to the city slums to even the deep jungle island. There are many diverse locations featured.[/b]

● Atmospheric and scary locations [b]~ Deep jungles, swamps, sewers, and other locations have a certain eeriness to it and I love it personally.[/b]

● Decent optimization [b]~ Runs great and it has quite a bunch of options for the player. Although it misses basic features like FOV slider or AF. Although it can be easily fixed.[/b]

● Game time [b]~ It will take you quite some time to finish the game. 30+ or 50+ hours at the very least.[/b]

● Excellent price [b]~ For £11.99 you will easily get loads of game time in this game if you like exploring and finishing side quests.[/b]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
● Clunky movement [b]~ The movement is very clunky and old. As in you can't grab ledges or vault. The walking method is always rather awkward to handle and control. You get used to it after some time but that doesn't excuse the game. There should've been some update to this so-called ""Definitive Edition.""[/b]

● Clunky vehicle controls [b]~ The driving itself isn't bad. It's the sensitivity when looking around. There is no way to change it anywhere so you're stuck with a PowerPoint level of speed when wanting to look around or behind you.[/b]

● Melee range [b]~ The melee system is still good in this game, one problem though is the fact that you have to be right up in the zombies face in order to get a hit and this literally applies to every weapon no matter the type. Batons, axes, Kanabō will all require you to be in face range in order for you to get a successful hit. It sucks.[/b]

● No blocking [b]~ There is no blocking with your weapons. You may only jump away from the enemies' blow but just like the movement, it is rather clunky. A block system even a basic one would have been so much better than this lackluster dodge system but alas we have to make do with what we got.[/b]

● Melee weapon condition [b]~ I have no idea whose idea this was but literally EVERY single melee weapon. Doesn't matter if it's a common variant or a legendary variant will degrade faster than a piece of paper.[/b]

● NPC escorts [b]~ They suck alright? I should be the one ensuring that the NPC I am escorting survives the trip. But these idiots will literally rush ahead of me and 99% of the time get themselves killed. I was escorting a Russian NPC and there was a huge zombie crowd ahead of him so I did what anyone else would do and threw a Molotov. Only for the re*ard to jump down into the fire and get himself killed. Seriously!?[/b]

● Weapon blueprints [b]~ There is a LOT of weapon blueprints in the game. When you discover one and read the name of the blueprint you will get excited because it sounds like it could be a deadly weapon. That is when you learn that about 80% of the weapon blueprints are rehashed copies of one another.[/b]

● Lip syncing [b]~ I know this game is old but the lip-syncing was awful back then and it still is awful today. There were many games that came out in 2011 with much much better lip-syncing than this. Clearly this game was made with a budget.[/b]

● The story [b]~ The story is awful. The survivors in the cutscenes take so many unnecessary, stupid, and risky moves that you will be pulling the hair out of your head. The only survivors with some sense of intelligence are Sam B and Logan. But the rest of them especially the girls are just plain dumb. They think with emotions instead of their heads. They need to look out for themselves yet they think that everyone can be saved. In these situations, not everyone can be saved. Sam B and Logan know it yet the rest of them don't. Jin is by far the worst offender. She is told multiple times to not do this specific thing yet she does it anyway and it is up to the player, in the end, to save her from the trouble. She is dumb, annoying, naive, and inexperienced for the world ahead of you. The fact that you have to travel with her all the way to the end is another annoyance. If it was up to me I would have just left her with some group of survivors and let her be their problem.[/b]

● Clunky shooting [b]~ The shooting is God awful. They seem to only be effective against human enemies. But zombies just seem to be bulletproof even if shot in the head. The shotgun which is obtained only at the end of the game is practically useless against the zombies. On top of that, the recoil and handling of it just feels strange and awkward.[/b]

● Zombie throwable weapons [b]~ Normal zombies can sometimes be seen carrying weapons. If there was an enemy stronger than all of the zombies in the game then it would be those zombies. As they can literally throw a small piece of wood at you from the continent of Africa and directly impact you. These hits will literally kill you in one hit or reduce your health to nothing. For me, it was the latter 99% of the time. This death was the biggest loss of money for me almost the entire time. It is such a bullsh*t mechanic. Whoever implemented this deserves an African slap across the face.[/b]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Overall Dead Island is still a good game. Despite the numerous cons, the game was still a fun adventure. All zombie lovers should give this a go as it is very cheap even when not on a discount. The combat is bloody and gruesome, the zombie variants are impressive and the world is huge and expansive.

[h1]Overall rating 6.5/10[/h1]

I had hoped that the Definitive Edition would fix the things that were stupid--a list too long to go into here--but it didn't. I'm not really sure why the Definitive Edition even needs to exist. It seems to have no purpose other than to bait suckers like me into buying it in the hopes that the awesome game that Dead Island could have and SHOULD have been had finally been released.

I can't think of another game that seems like it could be awesome, and would be awesome if not for stupid bugs and dumb design choices--NEVER auto-equip items to a player's hotbar--holding it back from you actually enjoying the game.

I think people love to hate Dead Island because we see that it could be awesome, but the game-breaking design flaws and completely-ignored bugs show a group of developers who rushed a great idea and didn't care to go back and correct their mistakes.

Not only do I not recommend this game if you've played the original--because it's the same damn game--I don't recommend it if you've never played it. I got it on sale for about $3, if I recall correctly, and I guess if you want to pay that much just to see what everyone hates about it, I can understand.

Dead Island is infamous, and for bad reason. It deserves that infamy, but don't hold it against Dying Light (the spiritual sequel to it). Dying Light is the sequel to what Dead Island could have been.

EDIT: 5th's time the charm, I guess. I gave it a go on my Steam Deck and finally beat the game. I just rushed through Acts 3 and 4, though. Still the same game, but I did finally beat it. Don't recommend it.",1514710852,1705024701,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

- Look around
- Nothing there
- ""Oh wait, maybe behind me""
- Nope.
- TFW it was just super slow and behind a car
- ""Wait, does this game not have the ability to make sound travel from certain spots?""
- MFW I just hear Zombie noises and can't tell where

- Slashing through the enemies, but prefer to throw
- Throws at a Zombie
- Zombie falls and is electrocuted and damages everyone, including me if getting too close
- ""Okay I'll just wait before I can pick up my weapon""
- ""Waiting 10 seconds feels like an eternity, doesn't it?""

- *Act 2 begins, no more driving bitch*

5)

6) 
- When do I finally get guns? I bet they are powerful and that's why it takes so long to get one.
- Running against a group of humans, everyone with a pistol
- Me with fucking kitchen knives WTF

I remember the trailer for this during the zombie revival of the late-2000's - early-2010's. It's probably still one of the best trailers for a video game ever made, in the sense that it got a lot of people (including myself) to fully buy into an otherwise mediocre game. Back then I wasn't as conditioned against the hype train like I am now, to the point of any and all hype potentially being a turn off and having the opposite of its intended effect. The opening scene is just as bad as I remember from the first time I played the game, and the cliches and stereotypes that were bad back then have only aged like fine milk. The writing and dialogue has to be some of the worst I've ever seen. It's not even fun in like a campy, ""so bad it's good"" kind of way... it's just bad. Now that they've re-released this on a newer-ish engine (8 years old at the time of me writing this) you'd expect it to look and perform really well, but it does neither. It's very buggy and the frame rate somehow struggles on a machine that can run games that look a million times better than this just fine. I was getting achievement popups for stuff I hadn't done yet, like I'd kill a zombie with a melee weapon and it would pop up ""Killed 10 Zombies with a melee weapon."" Very little effort went into making sure this was actually a good port, so I'd say paying $3 for this might be overpaying, given that it's a bad port of a bad game. Maybe there is some fun to be had here if you can rope some friends into playing, which is what a lot of the positive reviews seem to be, but it seems like a bad waste of time. My only regret is I played this outside the refund window.",1704330602,1704330602,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Also in some room in the quarantine zone... 3 or 4 zombies literally keep spawning right on top of me, that's just silly. zombies can hit spaces/places where you cant, some move slow others move way too fast and the fact that the ferals swarm you doesn't make the combat more fun when you miss, DL(1) definitely does combat better...even if there are some misses in that game too, it just feels more smoother.

chance, but end of act 2/beginning of act 3 is enough for me to say this game is not good. 

[h1]Repetitiveness[/h1]
It starts out fun, as you learn the combat, and the first few quests are fine in terms of your goals, and the process of achieving them. Once you get used to the combat, though, is when you start getting bored of it as it just becomes a repetitive tedious task which you try to avoid at all costs.

[h1]Weapon Customization[/h1]
The weapon customization the game seems to boast about is quite unbalanced, uninspired, lacking and limited. Even if there is a seemingly gimmicky customization, it just adds some sort of thing to your weapon, but swings the same, and might do something else in terms of the visible damage to the zombies, but nothing more. 

[h1]Driving[/h1]
The driving in the game is horrible in so many ways. The drivable vehicle models are very few (only 3, including the mandatory mission van, 11h in, after 2 acts). The driving itself is really clunky and badly done, and sometimes the steering wheel doesn't turn if you press the forwards and direction key too quickly one after the other. The terrain which you drive on can sometimes be really annoying and you end up crashing a lot of times or just being unable to move through, having to get out and fight the hordes of zombies to get to your destination.

[h1]Characters[/h1]
The characters and story are unmemorable (although I doubt the game tries to make them be), the writing is not very good, the voice acting is mediocre, and the game features several poor attempts at making you feel emotional for a character. I'm 12 hours in and I only know the name of 2 characters in the game, and that's only because I've heard their name get repeated dozens of times.

[h1]Why I decided to rate it early[/h1]

[b]CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS[/b]

As you are finishing act 2, your crew finally establishes contact with a radio guy they've been trying to contact for the entirety of the game! Great news, except for some reason, you, and most of your crew are suspicious of the guy because he is situated on a prison on an island, which doesn't make any sense. So, they start fighting with him over the radio over nothing, then just breaking the line for no apparent reason after all that trying? Nonetheless, at the start of act 3, they talk with him again, and again, they are suspicious for no apparent reason and decide to yell at him again and break contact once again, all while doing it in the most ignorant annoying way possible. This, on top of all the previous bad parts about this game, made me close it and immediately go write a negative review.

[h1]Should you get the game?[/h1]
If you're looking for a realistic, engaging, and story rich zombie survival game, you should not get it even on sale for 4 euros, as all you'll be getting [b]maybe[/b] 3h of fun followed by suffering which will make you regret ever purchasing the game in the first place.

If the reason you want to buy the game is just to kill some zombies, you should buy the game on sale, but still don't expect to have fun the whole time.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Don't buy it unless you enjoy playing bad games, or are just looking to buy it to decorate your steam game collection.

[i]I will still attempt to finish the whole game, and update the review if necessary.[/i]

I used to peep into my older brother's room and see him playing it and thought, ""Wow that shit looks sick, it's like a first-person Dead Rising"". However, upon playing it myself, my perspective shifted. While it might have been considered innovative and fresh during its time, my experience unveiled a game dominated by an extensive and convoluted fetch quest structure, interspersed with enjoyable open-world exploration in Acts 1-3 and passable combat.

A notable drawback lies in the absence of a proper dodge mechanic, despite a makeshift jump + direction key combo that fails to impress. This absence contributes to a perceived slowness in combat. On the flip side, the weapons in the game feel weighty and impactful, particularly the kick and most of the larger-bladed weapons!

The story in Dead Island Definitive Edition moves towards cliché, with missions often boiling down to three archetypal fetch-quest scenarios: go to location A and retrieve/activate something, collect five of a specific object, or protect someone while they perform a task. Unfortunately, the quests become monotonous and repetitive after the initial ten hours, though the brevity of the game at around 15 hours somewhat mitigates this issue.

However, Act 4 of the game feels notably rushed, lacking the depth and polish found in the earlier acts. The missions seem hastily put together, and the pacing becomes erratic. This hurried feel culminates in a final boss battle that is disappointingly uninspired and fails to evoke the excitement one would expect from a climactic encounter. It's a missed opportunity for a memorable conclusion that leaves players underwhelmed.

In hindsight, revisiting Dead Island might not be the most enjoyable experience for someone who last played it on the 360/PS3, as it hasn't aged gracefully. However, for those intrigued by the Dying Light franchise and curious about its spiritual predecessor, grabbing Dead Island Definitive Edition on sale isn't a regrettable decision!",1703042894,1703049861,True,4,0,0.543883323669433594,0,True,False,False

What started as what seemed to be a fresh take on the zombie survival game, turns into the same all regurgitated mess of a game that we have enough of already... Don't bother with this one even though it looks like it would better. Poor wasted potential.

Banoi, a paradise turned hell by a virus spread by a flesh eating indigenous tribe.
Dead Island is a great hacking, slashing , zombie thumping game; 4 misfits get together to look for survivors and find a way to get out of the Island to safety, using wood stick with nails and barbed wire, or huge maces that can make those brain eating devils fly.

Pros:
• Fluid combat.
• Plenty of decapitation/dismemberment.
• Down to earth concise story.
• Both beautiful and eerie locations throughout the game.
• Character progression through skill trees and special skills.
• Cool weapon customisations, which could be used in a real world situation.
• Arenas to mash some zombie heads!
• Achievements are cool enough to be attempted.

Cons:
• Spoiler [spoiler]We never find out why our protagonists are immune[/spoiler].
• Some minor bugs, such as zombies/items disappearing or getting stuck in walls/floor.
• If you do Arenas early you get op due to the extremely fast levelling speed.

I had initially planned to embark on an achievement run in this game, but truth be told, I find it challenging to muster the motivation to persevere through the gameplay. My youth holds cherished memories of this game, where the excitement of exploring the resort and battling zombies was truly exhilarating. Undoubtedly, the resort remains the highlight of the game; however, the rest of the gameplay is marred by significant flaws and can be downright irksome at times.

From the inconsistent and buggy combat mechanics to the shockingly poor human AI, the protection missions in the city are nothing short of horrendous. Battling the gangs is an even more of a horrendous experience, reaching a point where it makes the enemies in Dying Light seem like geniuses. While the gunplay is passable, the frustration peaks when shooting a zombie in the head doesn't result in an instant kill, making the firearms feel more like pellet shooters than effective weapons.

The story is acceptable, neither particularly noteworthy nor terrible. The characters, for the most part, are forgettable. While the locations are decent, numerous obstacles like chairs and bags obstruct the pathways, rendering the running segments of gameplay rather irksome.

Overall
Pros: - Fun intro
- Decent although forgettable melee combat
- Glitchy co-op

Cons:
- Everything above
- Awkward gameplay leading to annoying outcomes
- AI is so terrible it gets another mention here

[b]Dead Island[/b] feels like they came up with one great mechanic (The melee combat with analog sticks) and surrounded it with half-baked content all around. Driving is floaty and shooting sucks. Movement in general is clunky. It's really easy to get stuck on random props.

The mission structure is the exact same 99% of the time. Go somewhere (veeeery slowly), pick something up, take it back to some NPC, go find something else... Rinse and repeat for the entire game.

The plot barely exists most of the time. Voice acting is godawful. Characters are totally forgettable.

The island setting is great and memorable until you leave the first area. Then it loses all of its charm.

The game is carried HARD by the melee combat. It's always fun to beat the sh*t out of zombies swinging your weapon in any direction you like. That might be enough for a lot of people. But it wasn't enough for me.

So I'm a tad late to the Dead Island party and my overall experience is a solid 6/10. I finished this entire game solo in 20 hours, on & off in the span of two weeks, and that included doing most of the side missions before completing the main storyline.

[h2] Gameplay: [/h2]
I can forgive the janky gameplay considering this was a 2011 game , and having played Dying Light (my fav btw) prior to touching Dead Island, I had to get used to the slow transitions between combat and traversal but generally a decent movement set for a moderate-paced zombie hack n' slash. This was an enjoyable game to pass the time although later stages could get frustrating if you're not great at organising inventory, and not upgrading your weapons more than you should be. 

The skill-tree is a lifesaver, and the 'Fury' section can mostly be ignored as I barely used this gimmicky skill once I obtained more powerful weapons mid-game, and only focused on increasing stamina, damage and weapon durability.

[h2] Bugs: [/h2]
There were some missions where I had to mow through an entire town of gunmen, only to not have the final boss appear or invisible walls not deactivate then I would run back to the start, mow through the town again (they re-spawned) and THEN have the final stage of the mission appear. Other than that, a few minor bugs can be overlooked as they're not that detrimental to your progression.

[h2] Story: [/h2]
Oh boy, where do I begin. I had no idea what the story of this game was when it first release, despite watching early game-plays on YouTube, but finally playing through the entirety of it has made me feeling confused and unsatisfied.

[b][i]*Spoilers Ahead*[/i][/b]

Dead Island begins with the main characters stranded in a hotel resort surrounded by a zombie infection. 
[i] Good start, I'm pumped. Let me at 'em [/i]
Various objectives require you to retrieve and return objects, while killing baddies on the way
[i] okayy, as expected of an action-adventure. Give me something moree [/i]
We later find out that the virus originated from a group of natives inhabiting the jungles of the island.
[i] Interesting! (?) I can sort of believe it. Not the craziest thing I've heard so far [/i]
[spoiler]The military man from a super-maximum prison wants you to obtain a cure, send it to said prison, take it from you as he knocks you unconscious, turn super evil and send a mob of zombies AND humans to stop you, gets infected by his dead wife, shoots the one side-character as everyone watches, turns into the most mid zombie; highly vulnerable to elemental and explosive damage, dies.
[i] Uh...uhm, okay. That escalated... like a LOT. A bit nonsense but surely the next part should resolve it, tie up all loose ends quickly...right? [/i]
Hearing news that Banoi is quarantined, the team fly away from the prison in a helicopter.
[/spoiler]
[i] aaaaaaand!? [/i]
Game ends. Credits roll.
[i] Motherf*cker... [/i]

Despite having game-changing game-play mechanics, Dead Island's generic amalgamation of action-adventure tropes could not save the absurdity of its final act. The four main characters Sam B, Xian Mei, Purna and Logan all seemed like interesting characters that had me wanting to know more about who they are and what makes them special as survivors immune to infection. 
Instead throughout the game, I almost felt no attachment to their characters and there was times during cinematics where I felt like I missed something in the story. There were clearly times of conflict between the four members but it was never revealed how it originates or how it becomes resolved and the game clearly skips these moments of developemtn and decompression, purely for the sake of progressing and getting right back into the action, making their actions feel robotic and empty, like they're templates for a great action-protagonist group instead of being one.

As for Jin, her side-story of losing her father and taking the responsibility of the crew's equipment felt somewhat fulfilling and close-ended, like she could've stopped being involved before the second act. But the rest of the game needed a 'storage' mechanic and we're too late in the game to introduce a new character with the same character development, so Jin stuck along for the rest of the ride, all up until her confusingly and hilarious demise. 
Why did Jin get the final monologue before punishing the big bad? Why was she the one to release the zombie wife and be the only one to die because of it. Why did everyone just stand there and watch her get shot and fall off the platform, AND watch Mister Military-I-Can't-Remember-The-Name-Of inject the only apparent hope for the people of Banoi into his body? 

The ending of Dead Island felt rushed, and packed with too much information to be resolved in the limited cutscene before the final ""battle"". Jin's character was wasted on a plot-device purely meant to evoke feeling and quickly progress to the boss fight, but her actions and the direction that led up to her end was comically stupid and erased any instance of minute attachment anyone ever had of her. If anything, it felt only right for the team to apprehend Mister Military White and give a monologue on hope and humanity since it meshes well metaphorically as a co-op game or even Yerema should've died since she's a crucial part of the cure and that valiantly takes away any hope for humanity AND hope for White to bring his wife back. But alas, the team does nothing but watch because the game still needed a reason to proceed to the boss battle.

The game ends without any explanation of what happens to the people in the Resort, Lighthouse, Church, River Village etc. and the Island is closed-off to the rest of the world with room for more opportunities for sequels. 

I have not played Riptide at the time of writing, and frankly I have been hesitant to, but I'll give it a shot since I need something to kill the time. 

[h3] TL;DR [/h3]
Gameplay is good, story is a bit eh and over the place so I recommend playing with friends and have fun with it. Bought this and Riptide together for 12 bucks, pretty good deal for people looking for a quick hack n' slash kick out of it.

I can’t seem to find much about development as it keeps redirecting me back to the development hell of Dead Island 2 so I assume the game went swimmingly for the first part. I had initially missed the whole sad trailer hype so I never really knew what everyone was on about with the game per say, only that I had some buddies who played it and wanted me to join them. I remember first dropping into a 360 lobby with some peeps and a random person gave me a modded (not in game but an actual modded) baseball bat that sent people flying along with an infinite ammo shotgun. Playing the game with these items actually made the game fun but other than playing it with buddies from time to time, I didn’t really remember much of the game other than certain locations popping in my head every once in a while along with Sam B, so I bought the game for other people twice so I could play a coop game with them. The first two times failed because the game was incredibly boring and it didn’t mesh well with the others but third times the charm so shoutout to Brandon, Casey and Asian for the play session, and I'll also say that the Remaster comes with all the OG game's DLC in case you were wondering.

Overall, the plot in Dead Island is kind of middling a bit in my opinion. I like certain ideas about it, like the mystery behind The Voice, the potential to bond with and help survivors, the whole virus being a certain strain of Kuru in relation to the native tribes in the jungle, like it has some things I could see being interesting from a realistic perspective. However, I honestly hate to say this but I don't really care. The backstories you get for your main heroes don’t factor in at all to their character development in-game in anyway shape or form, and either you’re decent like Purna or Xian Mei or kind of an a s s like Logan or Sam B (not even an interesting one to be honest). The other characters are forgettable except Ryder White himself and Jin, with the latter just because she's kind of relatively annoying and kind of frustrating with certain story beats. For example, after being told multiple times not to go to the police station because they’re raiders and not nice people, she goes to deliver food anyways because it’s “the right thing to do” and then gets kidnapped for it, like no s h i t it’s not a good idea but she’s a good Samaritan so I can respect the intentions. Getting shot because she released Ryder’s dead wife in the end however? That was just stupid to do, though the rest of it with her being sad I can sort of understand with her experiences. In fact, she’s the only one I do understand because Ryder’s stuff you only really learn in a two hour DLC and even though there’s a twist in there (with him not being the voice), it didn’t feel like much of anything changed anyways from what was presented in the main campaign. Honestly, I barely remember ANYTHING with the main plot because as one review I read put it, it’s basically doing “errands inside of errands inside of other errands” and it just feels boring. If I could compare the main plot of this game to something it would be a DoorDash delivery, because literally that’s kind of all it is. Same with the side quests, there are some interesting ones I sort of remember but not enough that I’d want to spotlight them to be honest, and you kinda need to do these in order to level up while speaking of the gameplay.

The gameplay is not my cup of tea really and here’s why. The game’s mechanics surround itself with a system that we still see even to this day: level based combat. Level based combat can be fine if it’s not monotonous, but here it kind of is. Luckily zombies level up as you level up so it’s not unfair that you’re restricted from certain areas due to you being a level 9 and them being 26 but it’s still frustrating a bit due to the tools you're given. You earn weapons doing quests and pick weapons up off of the ground to use against zombies, and you're encouraged to use resources to mod these weapons (which hilariously enough also requires money, which why? You stuffing dollar bills into your electro sickle?) but if you constantly invest money into these weapons only for an hour or two later to have a better weapon with better stats that makes your old weapon kind of pointless, then why spend the resources to upgrade it in the first place. This is a pattern that kept going on for me throughout the entire game, and at this point it only felt worth it to wait til I was at maximum level to do it. That’s not to say each hero can’t do damage on their own, as each one has their own skill trees depending on the type of person you are. I played as Sam B, who was mainly a bruiser guy and whose skills mainly used heavier blunt weapons. I barely used the heavy weapons cause they always felt like ass but besides the point, you kind of create your own build depending on your skill trees and what you want, and you can’t upgrade everything to the top from what I understand. Purna’s special involves pulling out a gun and guns are her main thing (which you don’t even get an actual gun til’ later in the city so it’s helpful in the resort), Xian Mei has knives and Logan is just projectiles (which feels kind of useless because Xian Mei has knives so if Logan has throwing knives then what’s the point?).

The zombies I’ll start out by saying that I appreciate how much of an actual threat they come off compared to zombies in say Dead Rising. It’s a very strategic game and combat is based off of “how much stamina do you have in your bar” and “this guy is kind of a powerhouse, could I perhaps cripple his legs and make him fall down for some free hits?” and I can appreciate that aspect in relation to the horror the game is based around. Even seeing a giant horde come around and attempt to murder me is scary, but also kind of annoying because it gets into this loop of getting bounced around like a pinball machine before eventually dying and losing a percentage of my money. The more money you have, the more money you lose and it always feels punishing no matter if it’s my fault or if it’s someone else's. As an example, two of my buddies got tired later in the game and started messing with grenades and I got killed multiple times by accident and lost 100 grand out of 160 and that was frustrating as hell to lose all of that. As for actual combat, my experience playing co-op mostly consists of knocking out a few zombies then having to team up with the homies to kill one. I also want to point out here, playing this game in co-op brings the difficulty up a lot, while it’s a lot easier if it’s just you to go solo. I guess my main point is that while I appreciate the threat of the zombies, I feel like with how the game is balanced and mixed in with the level based combat system it goes from scary to annoying really quick, as I feel like I got cheap deaths (like pushed off a cliff for example) more than anything else, especially with suiciders.

The graphics in the game are spectacular and the action is intense. The cutscenes are also some of the best I've seen. I especially enjoy playing co-op with other people. It's a great opportunity to team up and take down hordes of zombies together. 

The weapons and upgrades are diverse and you can make your character the way you want to. I love collecting and modifying new weapons. Having all these options is a great element in the game and makes it that much more enjoyable.

Overall, Dead Island is one of the best zombie games I have ever played and it's certainly worth playing with friends. The co-op is an awesome experience and if you're a fan of zombie games, then you definitely need to check this out.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] A lot of sidequests wherever you go. Most of them are basically the same, but still believable. Everybody would require mostly the same help in such situation.
[*] Navigation via the minimap is ok in most cases
[*] Hack n Slash works decent
[*] Various weapons and mods that you can apply to ""fake"" diversity
[*] Potential Co-Op
[*] Your rewards from quests and loot scales with your level
[*] Enemies scale with your level - so you can remain in the same area while the loot and xp gains grow
[/list]



[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] Story is bad
[*] [b]Graphics and character design[/b]
[list]
[*] Every single of your possible characters seems to be a prick. You don't have an influence on that - at all.
[*] Voice acting is terrible
[*] Graphics are meh
[*] Character models are disgustingly ugly and the most scary thing in the entire game - no wonder you get attacked non stop
[/list]

[*] [b]Gunplay is one of the worst I have ever seen[/b]
[list]
[*] Upon ADS-ing there is a crazy aimbot on enemies bodies (never their head!) - even through walls
[*] There is an even bigger aimsupport whenever you aim next to enemies, that slows down your mouse movement so that you have to wipe across your entire mousepad to switch from somebody, you are aiming to, to another one that is literally right next to them. Same when you want to correct your ADS-aimbot from chest to head. It is just tedious and unreliable
[*] Not ADS-ing works in close range but later in the game it is required since the weapons are not accurate enough when you don't ADS ...... So you can't compensate it with your own skill. FUN
[*] No way to disable the aimbot and aimsupport
[*] No way to adjust the ADS sensitivity separately
[*] Shotgun feels terrible. Doesn't deal any damage to the head, even close range, when all pallets hit. It is only effective against charging enemies while in close range. Since there are usually multiple that charge you at once and the shotguns shoot rather slow you are most likely better of with a sword anyway.
[/list]

[*] [b]Gameplay[/b]
[list]
[*] Every now and then you need to use these guns though. Especially against living humans, that usually die to a headshot. Due to the low amount of bullets you can hold, you kinda have to run around with a pistol and a rifle all the time, taking up two valuable slots of your tiny inventory.
[*] There is a lot of slow motion going on when you kill an enemies or cut off limbs - why? Don't slow the game down and break the immersion
[*] The sidequest rewards can range from garbage to actually good weapons or blueprints. The major downside however is: You can not see what your reward is going to be - because that depends on your level at completion - not when you started it. But please at least show me which type of reward and of which rarity it is going to be. Potentially it is rare, but most likely it is going to be garbage. Especially in the later levels (35+) there are no good weapon drops anymore, so you are reliant on them to update your arsenal.
I assume it is smarter to ignore many of the midgame sidequests to avoid leveling up that fast. Especially when you are a firearm expert (which you should not pick btw)
[*] Your inventory is way too small, since your weapons break very fast depending on what you use and you need to loot enemies weapons to make profit. (Most importantly at levels 35+)
[*] Distribution of traders and workbenches is stupid. In a few areas there is one at every corner, in others you run around for half an hour without a single one. Combine this with scaling enemies and a tiny inventory and you get a lot of broken weapons so you can't touch enemies anymore. NICE. In this case you are going to die A LOT until you reach a trader or workbench.
[*] The skill tree is terrible. After level ~30 there are not necessarily any useful perks left. I never used the rage mode (still don't know how to activate it, due to the non existing keybind visualisation - see below) and never wanted to use firearms, which unfortunately was my characters expertise. For non firearm experts it may be different.
[*] The movement is weird. I don't know whether it is a performance issue or a bug, but whenever you run longer distances you slow down drastically every few meters, even though the FPS are stable. It feels so weird and actually made me sick a few times in certain areas
[*] Variety of non boss-enemies is 8. Which is ridiculously low and makes the game very repetitive.
[/list]

[*] [b]Usability, User interface, QoL[/b]
[list]
[*] FPS are locked at 60
[*] No way to adjust difficulty - game is way too easy in the beginning and gets tedious after level 30/35
[*] The keybind options are terrible - a lot of the actions are not listed and it took me a while to figure out how to open the weapon wheel for quick selection. Other listed options simply don't work
[*] Unfortunately there is no quick selection of a specific weapon. You have to use the weapon wheel or mouse wheel to scroll through them ....
[*] The amount of stuff you can do to your weapons is very limited and doesn't really make them feel different.
[*] Mod-upgrades don't tell you in which way they affect your weapons on the first selection, only in the combination menu with one of your weapons. Missing QoL in the user interface
[*] Can't zoom out from the map far enough to see the entire map, so you are constantly shifting the map around to search for locations ....
[*] Can't filter for specific things on the map
[*] Options to tweak the game are basically nonexistent

Dead Island is a more of a light-themed experience with multiple protagonists to pick from, set in a remote island archipelago in the Oceania.

It offers some RPG-like mechanics to level up your character's three main skill trees (Fury, Combat and Survival), where with each level increase of your protagonist, the world around you also levels up - so the game actually balances the risk and reward to keep you from feeling overpowered and ensures you can feel strong as well as vulnerable at times.  This prevents you from toying around, which is essentially to keep you in your character's foot.

The game is basically broken down into ""hubs"" with huge playable open-world areas, with some areas being vastly larger than others, sort of similar to Deus Ex HR/MK, with areas to explore and learn about the island, its natives and lifestyle.

The game isn't jank-free, released in 2011 when the concept of high quality PC ports wasn't really a thing - the motion blur and chromatic aberration implementation is quite awful which can not be completely removed without modding. Zombies re-spawn just few feet away from you and quite frequently - this is problematic as it can catch you by surprise, there's also no concept of zombie count decreasing, which is somewhat unexpected as our progress through the story should have some level of impact on it.

Each chapter has main quest, side quests (and recurring quests).  Main quests help you progress through the campaign, whereas side quests help you learn about the world (and some are essential and contribute towards the main plotline).  The third form, is to gain cash or items by fulfilling demands of certain characters at specific places around the map (usually safe-houses).

Although the game is far from perfect, it is in some ways better than the original ""non-Definitive Edition"" and has been fun for the massive discounted price I got the entire Dead Island bundle for.",1684040724,1699388473,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Released in 2006, the controversial decision to include a dead child got a lot of attention. The trailer is still held up by some as one of the most effective game trailers ever released. If you have an interest in the history of games, I’d recommend giving it a watch.

What I wouldn’t recommend is actually [i]playing[/i] Dead Island. It got lukewarm reviews when it was released and it hasn’t aged great since then. An emphasis on melee combat coupled with awful movement controls is a bad combination. Throw in fetch quests, bad economy balance, constant glitches and an incredibly dull story - and you’ve got quite a stinker.

Sure, killing zombies with a friend is fun, and a lot of people have nostalgia for the times they did that with this game. This remaster is for those people with rose-coloured glasses on, not for those of us with taste.",1697003045,1697003105,False,1,0,0.484189748764038086,0,True,False,False

[h2]Rating: ★★★☆☆[/h2]

Playing Dead Island is like planning a dream vacation only to realize the resort is infested with zombies. It's a tropical paradise turned into a survival nightmare, where your beachside cocktail comes with a side of undead chaos.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]

1. [b]Open-World Setting:[/b] The game's open-world design on a zombie-infested tropical island adds a unique flavor to the survival horror genre. Exploring the scenic yet perilous environment is both thrilling and terrifying.

2. [b]Weapon Crafting:[/b] Crafting your weapons from seemingly random items brings out the MacGyver in you. Who knew a baseball bat with nails could be so effective against the undead?

3. [b]Co-op Gameplay:[/b] The option for cooperative multiplayer adds a layer of camaraderie to the zombie apocalypse. Teaming up with friends to bash zombie heads is strangely satisfying.

4. [b]Varied Environments:[/b] The game offers a variety of environments, from beach resorts to dense jungles, keeping the backdrop fresh as you battle your way through the undead hordes.

5. [b]Emphasis on Melee Combat:[/b] While guns are available, the emphasis on melee combat is a refreshing change. There's a visceral satisfaction in smashing zombies with a sledgehammer.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

1. [b]Buggy Gameplay:[/b] Dead Island has its fair share of bugs and glitches, from zombies walking through walls to weapons mysteriously disappearing. It's like the undead have mastered the art of teleportation.

2. [b]Clunky Controls:[/b] The controls can feel a bit clunky, especially during combat. Precision movements become a luxury when you're surrounded by a swarm of zombies.

3. [b]Inconsistent Voice Acting:[/b] The voice acting ranges from decent to cringe-worthy. It's as if the survivors are more concerned about the delivery of their lines than the impending zombie apocalypse.

4. [b]Repetitive Missions:[/b] The side quests tend to be repetitive, often boiling down to fetch quests or clearing out zombie-infested areas. It's a formula that wears thin after a while.

5. [b]Outdated Graphics:[/b] The graphics, while once impressive, now feel outdated. The character models and environments lack the polish seen in more recent titles.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]

Dead Island is a mix of sun-soaked mayhem and undead chaos. While the tropical setting and weapon customization bring freshness to the genre, the game is marred by technical issues and a lack of polish.

[quote=][i]In the words of a survivor desperately fending off a zombie horde, ""I need a freakin' vacation."" Dead Island offers a vacation from the ordinary, but be prepared for a getaway filled with both the breathtaking and the brain-eating.[/i][/quote]",1696264548,1696326947,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Zombie apocalypse anywhere else is Dead Island: cleavers, baseball bats with nails, a stick with fire, or a sickle with some batteries for electrocution.

This mix of RPG with FPS which worked far better than I expected. There are some downs, specially the level scaling system: you get stronger and so do the zombies. What is the point then? I found the game easier when I was lvl 1, honestly. Also the coop is very flawed in comparison with L4D2, since you don't actually need anybody to help you anyway.

I had perfected the previous version of this game, which was removed from Steam. Good riddance! It was a bugfest and I had given it a thumbs down therefore. The ""Definitive Edition"" is basicall a fix for the original version. There are still a glitch here and there but overall, it plays smoothly on Linux.

The atmosphere is great at parts and other parts not so much. The driving is frustrating but it's also satisfying when speeding quickly and doing crazy stunts and glitches. 

It's a unique game that I've played through multiple times over the years and to be honest I feel kind of nostalgic for since it carries a lot of good memories. It's one of those it's not a bad game, but it's not amazing either. It seems to be just an overall ok fun game to play that you can't take too seriously.

Dead Island Definitive Edition reanimates the undead-slaying adventure for a new generation of gamers. The picturesque yet perilous Banoi Island is as captivating as ever, now rendered with crisper graphics and improved lighting. Engaging in brutal combat with improvised weapons still feels satisfying, and the cooperative multiplayer adds an extra layer of excitement. While some technical glitches from the original release linger, the Definitive Edition offers a blood-soaked getaway that's difficult to resist for both nostalgia and newcomers alike.

(In addition I brought 5 just because I enjoyed the game without saying anything about the small bugs that were there but in the end the eraser is just good for the year it came out)

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1692356787,1692356787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Summary:
""Dead Island"" is an action role-playing survival horror video game developed by Techland and published by Deep Silver. The game was released in 2011 for various platforms including PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Set on the fictional island of Banoi, located in Papua New Guinea, the game follows the story of a group of survivors who find themselves stranded in the midst of a zombie outbreak.

Players can choose one of four playable characters, each with unique skills and abilities, as they attempt to survive and escape the island. The gameplay focuses on exploring the open world, completing quests, crafting weapons and items, and engaging in intense combat with hordes of zombies.

The game is known for its emphasis on melee combat, where players can use a variety of improvised weapons such as baseball bats, knives, and firearms to fight off the undead. The island setting offers diverse environments, from lush jungles to beach resorts, adding to the atmosphere of the game.

""Dead Island"" also features a cooperative multiplayer mode, allowing players to team up and tackle the challenges of the zombie-infested island together. The game received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its engaging combat and open-world exploration, but criticism for technical issues and narrative execution.

Overall, ""Dead Island"" is notable for its unique blend of survival horror and RPG elements, creating an intense and immersive experience as players strive to survive the zombie apocalypse and uncover the mysteries of the island.",1691736241,1691736241,True,7,0,0.565559625625610352,2,True,False,False

and theres p u r n a. oooh god purna
shes like a ""woke"" activist always ready to yell at you because you had a disagreement with him
like lame as hell the first thing she brings up is ""i hate rich azzhohsz"" (like LADY THEN WHY ARE YOU WORKING FOR THEM?)
as for the zombies...well..generic choices but just stay away from the ones that run (the butcher and infected) they will hit you no matter what
the movement is one of the most limited hot garbage out there
 you can't climb unless it's a ladder and even then it's...weird. when you jump it's like you're a sphere trying to get it's way from a poorly aligned hitbox
the combat is EXHAUSTING you always get tired after hitting zombies like 3 times (be very careful if you're empty on stamina the next thing you'll know is you're on the floor after getting haymakered by one of them)
the gun combat is just cancer (the guns are VERY WEAK after a while)

so that's about it. the game is decent, buy it on a sale
it'll be pretty fun with friends so if you got a friend please make him play the game at gunpoint because i can say for certain the game feels empty as hell without someone else bothering to play with you",1691279557,1691279557,True,1,2,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

Smashing a zombie's ankle as it runs at you only to watch it cartwheel head-first into the pavement and splatter its brains across the floor never gets old, and the ability to throw melee weapons as a central mechanic can be used in fun ways.

I played through using KB+M and played as Sam B. (blunt weapons) and completely solo so I couldn't tell you how the multiplayer is, and I heard that a controller is the way to go for this game but mine wasn't working sadly.

Welcome, survivor, to the Island of Banoi... Had enough fun partying? Guess what, you just woke up to the apocalypse... Now you really gotta put your nimble fingers to the test.

In Dead Island, the whole world has gone to the poopies and you are one of four (or five with DLC) survivors, each with a different set of skills... Your task? Find a way out of this god forsaken place. It's actually easier after you've found out you're immune to the virus... Which actually doesn't serve your cause much if you've got a health bar. 

Dead Island is an action FPS RPG hybrid that's basically about a zombie virus, you get the idea; chaos and a lot of fighting and smashing things are involved. This game holds itself together through time, I swear... It's still graphically very beautiful to look at! Mechanics vary depending on who you're playing; as Logan (my favourite badass gangsta) you get these ""dart-knives"" you can throw that deal huge amount of damage after your RAGE meter is full... You fuel your Rage meter by kicking some arse. Your character can also take quests, RPG-style... Another very RPG-like thing your character does is level up and pick up new skills from a skilltree, but most of them are passives. 

Story-wise, this game is all over the place; sometimes your hero wants to find the nearest plane, and hijack it out of the island, other times your hero just wants to sit around and do voodoo magic to release the spirits lol... However, as you well know, in a game like this, a story is only secondary to the mayhem... I probably forgot to mention, that you find blueprints around these zombie-infested areas that you can use to craft new custom-made badass weapons. I like to use Katanas with a Light Saber Mod blueprint, which causes the zombies to become electrified and on fire; I gotta say I enjoy it a lot.

Dead Island is a [b]9/10[/b] Zombie RPG game and with badass Logan on the front, and Purna's ghetto sword swinging on the back, these zombies should be the survivors, not the other way around.",1690837922,1690926134,True,9,1,0.627329170703887939,0,True,False,False

[h1] TL;DR[/h1]
The game has exceptional melee combat, which is one of the main things good about it. It is very satisfying to kill a zombie in many ways possible. However, the ""Definitive Edition"" is pretty much like the original game with its flaws: repetitive quests that gets bland quickly and dreadful gunplay. Also, you can't play with others that have the original game.


The game's main plot has 4 acts in total, which should take on average somewhere around 20 hours in total to reach the end and beat the game.

Act I takes place in the resort area of Banoi. The map is pretty wide open and you can discover a lot of reachable locations, especially some minor quests where you help out survivors eliminate some zombies while they are stranded. They introduce driveable vehicles, trucks in particular, which are useful in going from Point A to B fast. Two special enemies are introduced: Thug and Suicider infected types. Thug infected are like Walker zombies that move at a slow pace. However, they have a lot of health and can easily knock you down with one swipe. Suiciders on the other hand are creatures that explode when you get too close to them or when they are killed.

Act II takes place in the city of Moresby. This is probably the longest and annoying setting. The area is so cramped and there are a lot of zombies and infected types (the ones that will scream and run at lightning speed). Some of them can even glitch and clip through walls. Not to mention, some annoying quests. The lack of fast travels around the city requires a lot of running. Ram and Floater special infected types are introduced. Rams are tough and strong undead zombies that will charge at you, potentially knocking you down if you are in their line of sight. Their weakpoint is an opening on their back. Floaters are decomposed zombies that spit out projectiles that blind or disorient you and will spray putrid liquid if you get too close. They are hard to kill because they can absorb a lot of damage. Lastly, human enemies are introduced, which are punks armed with either melee weapons or firearms like a pistol or an assault rifle in very rare cases.

Act III takes place in the jungle area of Banoi. This is where things get very interesting in the main plot. Human enemies are now more common to encounter unlike the ones in the Moresby city area. They are known as troops of Afran, an enemy warlord that commands his troops and is also the arch-rival of Matutero of the River Village. They are armed with pistols very commonly and instead of being armed with an assault rifle in very rare cases, they are sometimes armed with one. The last special infected introduced are Butchers, which are essentially faster, stronger versions of the Infected.

Act IV is the last and final act in the game, taking place on a small prison island that is east of the resort. Once you travel to the prison, there is no going back so it is best to prepare and make sure you have everything you need before traveling. The prison is home to many wanted terrorists and criminals from around the world. Firearms and ammo are fairly more common to see and you can buy ammo from prisoner vendors. You learn that ""the Voice"" first heard in Act I is Ryder White, a colonel in the B.I.D.F (Banoi Island Defense Force). However, you also learn that White is about to leave in a helicopter and will bomb the entire island of Hanoi and you must stop him from escaping after he has drugged you and taken the vaccine. Once you reach and confront him, you witness a hard scene by watching Jin get shot and killed by Ryder after she releases Emily (Ryder's wife that is infected) that causes her to bite Ryder. As Ryder injects the vaccine on him, it actually doesn't turn out to be a cure at all as he mutates into a big zombie. As the last enemy and protagonist, you end this for good by eliminating him and escape in Ryder's helicopter to beat the game.


So that's that for the main plot. Now for the pros and cons based on my experience.

Pros:
+Decent graphics which is nice for those who has owned and played the original game.
+The game is open world. You're free to explore pretty much anywhere and you don't have to finish a quest on a time limit.
+Nice and addicting melee gameplay. You can find a good melee weapon almost anywhere and if you have good luck then you can find a much better one.
+Amazing gore when you kill zombies and human enemies.

Cons:
-You can't play with people that own the original game. If you want to play with each other, then you and your friends must buy and own the ""Definitive Edition"". Some people bought the original game and still have it to this day and asking people to buy the same game again is very demotivating.
-Wonky movement. By that, the movement is not so smooth at all, even when capping at 60 fps.
-Horrendous gunplay. The gun combat is just... what is even that? There is like some sort of assisted aim that even when aim assist is completely disabled, it's still there.
-Melee weapons will break and don't last for a long time. If you want to keep it running, then you have to find a workbench and repair it.
-Quests are very bland and are all the same. Help survivor get something and return it back to them, escort them to safety, etc. It's a rinse and repeat process to which it gets boring very fast. This doesn't add any originality and creativity.",1690724982,1690724982,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died.

The arena mode is super fun and somewhat addicting for a while.

All in all, this game is a complete package. Multiplayer is easy to use and you don't need to download hamachi or other third party programs or know how to set up a server and use some arbitrary symbols in a line of code to get it to work.

There are 4 characters to start with and I believe only 1 secret character you eventually get - I hope I am remembering that correctly. I've been playing this game on and off for the last 10 years now. Great game and still very playable today - especially on lower end systems.

Сюжет у игры максимально детский и не представляет из себя ничего кроме силы дружбы и сказочного желания жить мирно в ситуации зомби-апокалипсиса. Персонажи не проработаны и их мысли такие же как я описал в предыдущем предложении. Но при этом главная цель все-таки дает какой-то стимул верить что люди в игре правда стараются бежать от беды.
Кат-сцены в игре убогие от чего и смешные, безэмоциональные лица персонажей во время диалогов с повышенной экспрессией, а перевод на русский еще смешнее - во время диалога гг с персонажем можно услышать то, как актеры озвучки просили перезапись сначала или ошибались и смеялись в процессе. Единственная проработанная кат-сцена, проигрывается при заходе в игру, там и анимации и мимика лица на высоте, в самой игре - БУЭ!
Геймплей - моя любимая часть этой игры! Нам предоставляют на выбор 4 персонажей, у которых есть умения в одной из областей использования оружия - метание, огнестрельное, заточенное, тупое, ну и так же у персонажей свои статы на старте, здоровье и выносливость разные. Я играл за заточенное оружие, так как кромсать противника гораздо веселее и проще на мой взгляд. В процессе нарезки противников направо и налево я заметил один огромный минус, залагивание персонажа во время удара, то есть перс может остановиться от слова совсем и принимать на себя волну ударов ходячих. Еще один минус системы боевки, так это то, что зомби имеют особый баг или особенность бить от 3 до 4 ударов в секунду, да еще и опрокинуть на совсем (насмерть в общем). Раз уж мы задели тему опрокидывания, то уместно будет сказать что если вас откинет в текстурку где нельзя встать то вы умрете, если вы попадете в текстурку где все таки можно встать вы будете обречены на смерть, если вы были опрокинуты в толпе зомби, у вас есть 99% шанс выжить потому что зомби очень воспитанные бойцы и не бьют лежачих. 
Теперь я хочу задеть очень зубоскрежащую и глазовырывательную тему как ПЕРЕДВИЖЕНИЕ, не удивляйтесь, лучше сыграйте и поймете уже на первой минуте игры. Передвижение в игре выглядит так будто я передвигаюсь по льду, легче будет сказать что я играю в Thief 3 Deadly Shadows где ходьба примерно такая же, ну или давайте пример посвежее - Only Up. Машины - очень удобный вид передвижения, но очень криво реализованный, в этом приспособлении шайтана нельзя нормально повернуть или развернуться, а сдавать назад без видения того, что там находится не очень... Также сенса в игре не позволяет нормально осмотреться находясь в транспорте ну и не только в нем. И КТО ПРИДУМАЛ ЧТО В ИГРЕ ВСЕ МАШИНЫ ПРАВОРУЛЬКИ?!?!?! Это очень неудобно, особенно когда ты хочешь зайти в транспорт с другой стороны ПРОСТО ЗАЙДИ И ПЕРЕСЯДЬ НА ВОДИТЕЛЬСКОЕ, тупая условность...
Опасности игры. В игре очень много опасных моментов, от которых игрок будет чувствовать себя напряженно. Перечисляю: Бешеные зомби, которые кричат и быстро бегут за вами - их удары могут оглушить или нанести большой урон. Громилы - любым своим ударом наносят колоссальный урон и опрокидывают. Таран в смирительной рубашке - 50 на 50 что вы его задоджите, потому что ходьба в игре, опять же, ужасная, ну а если удалось уклониться, то не забывайте что у него есть ноги и голова - колоссальный урон+опрокидывание или моментальная смерть. Камикадзе - говорит матом и взрывается, в чем опасность?? не открывайте дверь за которой слышите маты, иначе взрыв и смерть. И наконец зомби с заостренным оружием - самые опасные ребятки, эти особи умеют кидать оружие в вас и это смертельно опасно (ваншот ван килл ноу лак джаст скилл)
Реализм??? Я не знаю зачем разрабы сделали так - персонаж очень аккуратно открывает двери и собирает предметы, но это не похоже на то, что он старается каким либо образом выжить, а как будто находится в детской песочнице.
Стрельба - с ней все замечательно, но ей мешает, передвижение и сенса игры (она слишком плавная и целиться от этого не удобно)
Регулярные задания - это что-то с чем-то) лишнее...
В этой игре минусы преобладают над плюсами, но их на самом деле не так много. В основном игра затягивает, но бесит всем что я перечислил выше. Рекомендую к прохождению, но ожидать чего то грандиозного не стоит. 
Когда покупал, меня никто не предупредил что в игре много недочетов. Так что прежде чем покупать подумайте о жизни.",1689495903,1689495903,True,1,0,0.493421077728271484,0,True,False,False

The definitive edition is a remaster or a “facelift”, if you will, that make Dead Island and its sequel Dead Island: Riptide more in line with Dying Light. In terms of graphic, it got a decent upgrade thanks to new Chrome Engine which was used in previously in Dying Light. And the comparison ends there.

Dead Island is not the same as the later franchise. It focused more on melee combats and exotic but isolated locales than with parkour or a true open world experience. The story is serviceable and player can choose who to play as, each with their own specialty and weakness. Melee combat is the main draw of this game. You can use variety of blunt or sharp objects, with better weapons and guns appeared later in the game. You can upgrade or modify weapons to be more effective. You mostly fight zombies and sometimes human enemies throughout the game. But, the enemy AIs wasn’t very good to begin with.

The game starts slow. It gradually opened up as you progress. The world is mostly divided up into sections rather than a seamless open world. The highlight for me is the city section with its long winding roads, shortcuts, and bunch of materials and weapons to collect. There’s a simple leveling system and skill tree for players who wants to prioritize towards a certain build or gameplay style.

There are plenty of missions and side objectives to complete or places to discover. Each mission’s structure is relatively simple and can be completed quickly. For some it can become tedious and doesn’t offer a lot of variations.
At the end of day, Dead Island shows that there’s a potential for this kind of games.

I simply can be described cash grab since i dont believe the original was probably better for performance , steam overlay , the wierd thing where you try to minimize or just tap out and you cant do anything on desktop unless you tap out certain way or open a manager after taping out.
The - :
1. Dying means nothing since losing some % doesnt destroy your time.
2. losing stamina letting yourself get hit might slightly do more damage but while are in animation they cant attack and you will recover stamina.
3. I notice aim assist it was annyoing.
4. ID cards why cant you see what number you are missing?.
5. Level means constantly changing good weapon for higher level ones since you damage drops after 3+ levels of course you can upgrade it to last 5,6+ levels even that is a stretch.
6. Connecting to other players might be broken since you can spam join even if they kick you. But that was a + for me since you can encounter lot of scum that want your weapons , items and then kick you. So i just repeat join on them and when 15min was done bye. I took maybe 4 min of their time with this.
Tesla bomb i could only throw it with range that damages or insta kills me.



The + :
After finishing game or chapters you can go back with all you have.
There are few good changes that i am sure you can find on wiki from the original to definitive.
Analog fighting seems better for feeling that you can chose what direction your attack goes and the impact it has but its confusing.
Throwing strong weapon and its sharp will deal huge damage.

The idk :
Kick at the start , throwing weapon are best damage dealers.
Since levels exist i didnt bother with custom weapon.


Only thing i enjoyed was that analog impact.

I played this game back then at release and enjoyed myself a lot and recently got it as part of the franchise pack with Riptide as I never got to play that one. The “definitive” edition is not what it advertises, as the main base game never really had huge content expansions. The only thing of interest is the arena and Ryder class/campaign DLC, which are in itself not that interesting which means its more of a marketing trick.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
Dead Island basically takes the Borderlands gameplay and completely alters it on a zombie focus. You have 4 main classes, each focusing on a specific combat aspect, blunt, sharp, throwing weapons and guns. The latter being rater a niche thing in this game, most weapons you find are useless and those that are useful tend to be used rarely due to the rarity of ammo aside from lategame content.

Weapons have durability and have to be repaired to be used again after a certain amount of time. There are various weapon modifications available, where weapons look completely different and have the chance to add new status effects like electricity. The combat itself is really simple and fun but a bit lackluster as you cannot really block or dodge. Aside from kicking or throwing there isn't much you can do to avoid damage. But the combat that is there is unique enough, atleast for the time it released, to be fine with some shortcomings. There is also a variety of zombie types that slowly get introduced to spice things up.

The classes all have their own rage mode that fills up via kills. This is mostly the biggest difference between those classes, the only other one will be if you either focus on blunt or sharp weapons, the latter being a more common skill shared across the characters. Enemies level with you, so it doesn’t matter if your friend is the first level and you're max level, the main difference is some minor side skills like being able to stomp enemies when downed. I don’t really like it that much as this makes levelling absolutely superficial. Starting area zombies will require more or less hits even with max level. The biggest difference is the gear, having a really good weapon for your current level will make the biggest difference.

Additionally the correct build for a specific time is also detrimental. This can make certain player levels harder if they focused on non damage upgrades first, or have no damage upgrade available later. This is not as bad as it sounds, as the game is not really that hard, you respawn immediately anyway and just lose money.

Quests itself are also not as interesting, some have unique tasks, but mostly its just grabbing an item and bringing it to someone. Serviceable.
On a side not the game also can be a bit buggy, nothing gamebreaking but noticed glitches here and there.

[u]Story[/u]
The main story of the game is not really interesting side quests even more so,  although the zombie infested island setting is pretty creative. Most of it is there just to give you a goal so you don’t get bored, a reason to continue to the next area and do activities there.

[u]Sound[/u]
Although the main theme is very good, there isnt that much in this game in therms of music. Most of the sound design is very atmospheric, especially the distant zombie screams, wind howling and so on. Combat sounds are also really neat and add a lot to this game.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Especially for its year of release the graphics are amazing. Not only can you cut off enemies limbs, but also break them or make them bleed. Generally the main focus was on the zombies and their movement and reaction to combat. The island itself has also a variety of cool locations and nice effects to them, although it is personally too hard for me on the motion blur and bloom. Animations and models of other side characters can be really awkward and unrealistic though.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
 Now if you look for a coop game with some unique melee combat this one is pretty good. But it has its shortcomings, with some combat design issues and I personally don’t like autolevelling enemies in general which cause non-damage skills to make the game much harder. The island design is really great and a lot of the games systems are really well made for such a unique game. Classes arent that much different aside their rage mode and some passives. In general its a fun game, with a few bugs here and there that dont break the game.

If you're not like me and you don't have a strong sense of nostalgia tied to this game (it was the first game I ever bought with my own money), you have no reason to put yourself through it. It's not worth explaining, but for shits and giggles I might as well.

1.) The story and the characters are just awful. Since I've already played it a long time ago this might just be a ""me"" issue, but very rarely do I find myself skipping everything just for the sake of getting to the end of the game. Midway through chapter 2 I couldn't handle any more of the same song and dance of fetch quests with minimal backstory, so I skipped every bit of dialogue I could.

2.) The progression is a joke. If you want to have a modicum of fun playing this, just play Logan. I played Sam B and I never once felt powerful (although I hear Sam B is the only one that doesn't get one shot by zombies wielding knives. Sound fun to you?). I finished the game at level 35 out of 50, and most of the skills are completely worthless. It's not like Dying Light where you get to level 2 and you unlock a lethal drop kick. You'll get a level and you can now unlock the first tier of a perk granting you +5% blunt weapon damage. It's boring and levels feel meaningless. You'll unlock the headstomp and that'll be your bread and butter for a while and will be the most powerful you feel throughout the entire game.

3.) The guns. I mean, what in the actual fuck? First off, the game has autoaim for M&K. Or atleast some kind of autoaim. It tries to faintly guide my aim, which is a big no no for any PC game. If you try to hip fire, your character will resemble the wacky inflatable arm tube man. I'm talking gyro-copter levels of camera spin. Akin to spin-bots in CS. I suspect this has something to do with my FOV mod I made sure to install to go from 60 to 90 FOV. So yeah it's probably my fault, but I ask you this Mr./Mrs. PC gamer: do you want to play on console FOV? On top of this, they have this weird hit registration to where your first shot will ALWAYS be a blank. It won't hit anything, not zombies, humans, or propane tanks. If you go like 3 seconds without landing a follow up shot after any successful hit, your next shot will always miss. Expect a 5th of your total ammo used in the entire run to be blanks and another 5th of your shots to be straight up misses due to weird auto-aim and other things.

4.) The sound. This one is the most confusing. I turned my volume down to 5% so I could watch Netflix or Youtube while I grind the achievements because, as I said before, this game ain't worth paying attention to. Anyways, there's a loud bang that plays for no good reason and it isn't affected by your audio settings. And by loud I mean LOUD! At first I thought it was to denote a critical hit, but it plays randomly for no reason. It even played when I opened a door for god's sake. It sounds minor but it will grate your ears after a short while. I recommend just muting the volume altogether, but c'mon, what game worth your time gets better when you mute the volume completely? Absolutely none. 

It wouldn't be a proper review if I didn't try to shine some light on the positives. The first chapter set piece is awesome. They really should have based the game around the resort rather than limiting it to the first chapter because once you complete Act I the game plateaus. Also, the basic concept of killing zombies however you please is tried and true, although Dying Light does this concept much better. That's about it for the positives.

TL;DR Dead Island is just not fun. You'll enjoy the first Act, but everything after is such a slog and wouldn't be fun even on a first playthrough. I would strongly recommend you don't waste your time on Dying Light's bum of an older brother.",1688349050,1688613416,False,8,3,0.569309771060943604,0,True,False,False

Nearly all of the missions are lifeless fetch quests. The story itself feels very tacked on and cliche. The melee combat against certain specials is infuriating and unfun. The best part of the game is combat against other humans inside buildings, but for whatever reason, these encounters are few and far between. Instead, most of the gameplay is weaving through the same open areas with obnoxious amounts of glitchy zombies to fetch item A and return it to place B.

The UI sucks too. To equip a weapon from your inventory takes 4 clicks that are far apart. This creates a cumbersome loop at the beginning when you are always picking up stuff to equip and throw.

The game ""burns out"" too quickly. After 16 hours I questioned myself why I'm still playing it.

Pros:
- Tropical island is nice to explore and pleases the eye
- Dynamic action, blood & gore look spectacular and have decent animation.
- Variety of weapons and mods
- Immersion into the atmosphere of the disaster of Zombie Apocalypse (one thing that was completely lost in Killing Floor 2) is present in the game.

Cons:
- There are better games about adventures on tropical island. Such as Xenus 2: White Gold (aka War in Paradise) and Far Cry 3.
- The gameplay becomes boring too soon. Running back and forth through the same locations many times to bring a quest supply item from one hut, then from the one next door etc., and fighting through the same crowds of zombies. After going for the 5th time on the same road, I wished the location was just cleared for good.
- Weapons. While there is a lot of them, they are all similar with randomly generated stats. You come across dozens of cleavers, diving knives, kitchen knives, sticks, sorting the ones that have slightly higher stats. It's annoying and consumes lots of time.
Special rotten tomato for absolutely ridiculous weapon durability. Where have you seen knives, hammers and axes that break so fast.
So, logical continuation of previous issue (and game mechanics) that the fighting balance is broken. There is absolutely no reason to use anything than throwing weapons. Throwing has auto-aim, mostly 1 hit kills a regular zombie and doesn't make the weapons degrade. In the end, you just keep a bunch of blades (they don't bounce) with highest damage to throw them at the enemies. Mods, durability and appearance of the weapon don't matter. Also throwables let you avoid getting hit by the enemies, melee combat might look showy, but enemies tear the hero apart too easily. After killing 334th enemy with auto-aim thrown cleaver it gets boring.
It's better when a game has just a dozen of weapons, each with it's own unique, handmade fixed stats. In this case, obtaining each of them actually makes difference and becomes an event in the game.
- Leveling system. In some games leveling is made to make the protagonist stronger then basic enemies and be able to take on stronger ones. Here you level up and the enemies and items keep leveling up with you. So, the entire leveling system makes no sense.
However skill bonuses are done well. Would rather had only them without the level number
Another game series published by Deep Silver had it done right: Risen. Enemies were always the same level (actually, they didn't have any), some of them were meant to encounter in the beginning of the game while others required a well developed and equipped character to fight them. Xenus 2 also had it right. Each level was giving you literally +1 hit point to basic 100 on Lvl1 (so you have 130 HP on Lvl 30) + some combat skill to choose from that gives a little advantage, similar to skills in Dead Island; and all this in the world that remains the same.
- Open world is good when it's handmade, every enemy and object is thought through and placed right where it fits the best. Here I see one big Random Number Generator.

Sometimes properly directed linear ""rails"" are better than a poor open world sandbox. I played enough of Left4Dead 2 and Killing Floor 1, and wanted something new. New, but not better. Unfortunately, there is no The Last of Us on PC. I'll try Dying Light, hope it would be more interesting.",1550657503,1688028694,False,13,0,0.564856112003326416,2,True,False,False

Where it fails is the lack of focus, it does not know whether it is a comedy or serious, whether it is an action game or a RPG. The problems are manifold, I will begin with the main ones.
The leveling system is very similar to what is found in Borderlands. This means you gain experience by killing zombies and finishing quests. With each level your character (there are several playable characters with different strengths and weaknesses) gains a skill point. The enemies also gain levels making them stronger. The weapons have levels as well. I understand the point behind the system, this forces you to constantly get newer weapons. The problem I have with this is that it totally breaks the immersion. For instance: Let's say you have a Feeble Kitchen Knife level 2. Let's say 30 hours later you have gone up 34 levels and find a Feeble Kitchen Knife level 35. Now, for some reason this newer and shinier Feeble Kitchen Level 35 will kill zombies 20 times better and the old one is now totally useless. The only thing changing is the level of the kitchen knife. Alright, in the real world Japanese and German high carbon steel kitchen knives will be better than Chinese stainless ones with plastic handles. But will they be 20 times more effective at killing zombies? No, they wouldn't. This is an artificial way to force you to get better weapons. I have the same gripe with the enemies. Yes, the game should become gradually more difficult, but another way to do it would be to introduce more enemies, or different enemies or other means. Which the game does, but it still has the same old walkers gaining levels, which means a walker level 20 will be much stronger than a walker level 1 even if it's the same enemy. Why do the zombies become stronger? Since the enemies will scale with your level it gives very little motivation for your character to gain levels (other than to get the skill points). I just find the leveling system very stupid and immersion breaking. In Borderlands it kind of worked perhaps because of its comic book aesthetics or its sci-fi setting. Here, it makes zero sense. I mean RPG games in general have a progressive system for weapons. Knife, short sword, longsword, twohanded sword. Or something like that. It makes sense, it gives a sense of progress. Kitchen knife level 1 to Kitchen knife level 20 does not. To be fair, there are other weapons as well, I am just saying the level system feels like something that is tacked on.
The next problem I have with the game is the constant re-spawning of items and enemies. Even if it's within a constricted location your enemies will reappear quite soon. Again, it breaks the immersion. Places you have looted will be filled with loot again. How? Why? Don't ask, don't know. You are never awarded for cleaning out spaces of enemies unless it's a part of quest. In real life it would make sense to kill the enemies so you know you have an escape route if things turn south. Here it's pointless, the enemies will be there anyway. And it is not because they move from one location to another, they magically reappear. Which brings my to my next problem.
Quests will make certain enemy types appear at just the wrong moment even if you made sure everyone was dead and there were no enemies in sight. Again, breaks the immersion. Game mechanics.
Then we have the headstomp. If you fell a zombie (or a human) you can instantly kill him by stomping the head. This is way more effective than any melee weapon or gun. Even if the enemy has metal helmet on. Makes zero sense. This is actually the most effective way to kill zombies. Get them on the ground and step on their head.
Repairing the weapons. I don't mind melee weapons breaking down. I mean tools with wooden handles or weapons made of wood will break down. Knives will get dull or even blades could break. However, the repairing system in this game is really silly due to several things. You can repair and upgrade weapons at workbenches. Knives, machetes I get. You can sharpen the blades. However, how do you fix a tool with a wooden handle for instance? In real life you would have to replace the handle. In this game, you just pay some money. To whom? No idea, but it costs money and not parts to repair weapons. And why do tools like crowbars or hammers with metal handles break? I mean big mean wrenches are practically indestructible... They would not break after smashing in a couple of zombie heads. Again, the whole system is so far from reality it makes zero sense.
The crafted weapon is the next point. Could have been great. There are way to many silly weapons you can craft in this game. And many of them would make good weapons worse. Like the Ripper mod. Would not work at all. It would make sense to fasten the circular blade instead of having it rotating with the help of a small battery. Or make it like and angle grinder. Some of these weapons would more likely make the zombies die of laughter than damage. Or the Barbed Wire mod. I really wanted to make a Lucille for my character. The barbed wire in the game around the bat is totally loose. It has to be wrapped around the bat supertight so it does not move a quarter of inch. The spiked bat, such as in the game, not good. Those spiked would come loose in a few hits.
Guns. Gunplay feels totally wrong. The weapons sway way too much and are way to slow to aim with. Unless you play with Purna. Basically the gunplay is terrible for anyone else. I have very limited experience with guns in real life. I've shot with shotguns and rifles a few times, I am not an expert but in real life it is way simpler to use firearms. In this game, it's very very clumsy. And very ineffective. You can shoot a high level shotgun aiming for the head but it still requires like 5 shots to bring down a zombie. Like what the what? A headshot against a zombie head is always instakill provided you get a good hit. Should be so with pistols and rifles as well, but not in this game. Terrible gunplay with other words. Throwing knives or other weapons is way more effective. I don't think the developers have ever used guns in their lives.
Killing zombies does not require you to damage the head. Like, this is rule number 1, 2 and 3. Always go for the head. Hitting the head will kill faster though, but I wish it would be the only way to kill a zombie.
Driving totally sucks. I don't mind the steering wheel being on the ""wrong"" side (the game is set in Banoi) but I do mind total lack of physics. Feels nothing like driving a car. I don't think the developers have ever driven a car in their entire life either.
Talking about physics, minor items like inflated balls or small bags can stop not only you in your track but cars as well.
Bandit AI is as stupid as zombie AI (the zombies are excused, bandits not so much).
Some enemies are just annoying and do not fit in (like the ram).
Plot, very bad, I have seen B-movies with much better plots. This is more like a Z movie plot (pun intended).
I think I have covered most of the issues I have with the game.
The good things. Killing zombies with melee weapons is fun. And the damage system isn't half bad. The graphics are totally okay. The maps are okay. Overall, I think this game is very overrated.

Basically, I think it would have been much better without any character or enemy or weapon levels. A set amount of enemies instead of re-spawning. Only hits to the head should kill. A lack of crosshair would make the game better as well. A better system for crafting and repairing. More serious (like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Metro). Better physics. Gunplay should have been improved. More open world than now (it is quite linear in reality). So in short, if this would not have been a console port it could have been great. I just feel that there are way too many distracting issues that break the immersion.

- The side mission are all basically the same;
- Zombies can see you from 10Km away and they will run like people during covid time to get toilet paper. (A stealth mechanic in this game would have been awesome)

- Play arena mode once you have all guns (handgun, shotgun and rifle), 1/2 good melee weapons and throwables: you will fight against all the different type of zombies of the game and you are going to use all of the weapons in order to survive;
- Play coop with friends;
- Play the game without using fury and repairing melee weapons (this challenge will incentives you to avoid enemies, use all your tools, use all kind of weapons and so on)

It is rewarding to play, but more than that, it has gameplay that you can respect. And because its gameplay, simple as it is as a first-person keep-away simulator that consist of the the same gameplay loop from start to end, is so pure and distilled, it comes off as gameplay without conceit, one that compels you to continue squash zombie brains for hours on end.

That doesn't mean this game is not without its problems. Dead Island is overstuffed with repeat content that has you visiting the same locations over and over; exploration is not encouraged, a strange characteristic for an open world game; the story is trite and the added DLC only serves to double down on this distinction; and it shows itself to be insensitive in its portrayal of minority and aboriginal characters. Worse of all, the chapters are arranged from best to worse, leaving the player's expectation with nowhere to go but down after leading off with the resort, easily the best part of the game.

And yet, it does have its charm. Having to deal with the enormous success of its memorable teaser trailer, Dead Island shows itself to be an enduring gem that can easily stand on its own merits. Perhaps the nicest thing to say about Dead Island is that its graphics are too good. (Yes, really. A game about bashing in skulls standing three feet away from you doesn't need draw distances that stretch a mile away.) All the same, the craft and care put into Dead Island makes for an immersive game that gives players exactly what they want: an fulfilling reward-to-time ratio that translates well into a cozy, comforting, chicken noodle-type of game to play.",1687404967,1687404967,True,12,0,0.646013200283050537,0,True,False,False

1. for some reason shows you the tutorial only with the controller inputs (even if you do not have a controller), 
2. the inventory system is waaay too complex which makes the game hard to understand
3. you cannot change keybindings no matter how hard you try
4. half of the player actions don't work from controller
5. the game is capped at 30fps and there is no explainable reason (both my monitors have 60hz refresh rate and the fps don't go above 30 even in the menu)
6. both controller and keybord controls are clumsy asf
all sumed up, the overall game is good but there are some bugs (or intentional mechanics idk for sure) which make the game almost unplayable. i'd still recommend this game but those things MUST be fixed sometime in the near future.

I’d started this game a couple times over the years, finally decided to actually play it through once. I started with Ryder’s campaign, but didn’t particularly enjoy it and stopped at the point where he first enters the sewers.

I then started the main campaign as Purna. It’s actually a pretty vast and detailed game world with extensive maps, more side quests than you can shake a stick at, a beefy primary campaign, decent cinematics, solid gameplay, fairly good voice acting although also fairly cringe dialogue lol. There is also a very real sense of tension and urgency in this game despite there never really being timers attached to any actions or quests.

I didn’t particularly enjoy melee, but throwing melee weapons OTOH…I pretty much lived by this technique lol. I also made liberal use of firearms since I was playing as Purna. Aiming is a little wonky, but you get used to it. Also, running over zombies in a vehicle never gets old.

One weird detail is that no matter if you’re playing solo or co-op up to the full group, the cutscenes and all relevant dialogue presumes that you are playing with all four main characters active. That can be weird at times since any unused characters do not accompany you in game. Also, you will likely be OP by the time you fight R...I mean, by the time you get to the final boss fight. Protip: after the first wave of zombies, run to the back. It's easy to get bogged down in endless waves of zombies and not notice the next stage of the boss fight.

Anyway, as much as my memories of the original were mixed with this game, the Definitive Edition was actually a lot of fun and has the potential to be quite the time sink if you’re diligent in completing all side quests and especially if you are a cheevo completionist. As it stands, being fairly diligent and playing through once was good for a solid 32 hours (I've played this on both Steam and the PS5, for reference).

Anyway, holds up perfectly well and is worth at least one playthrough. Definitely one of the better zombie games out there.

3.Combat is nothing special, just slash slash slash, and when your character been blown off by zombies, you will heard ""Ahhhhhhhhhh"", and that is FKing annoying, trust me.

Dead Island is an open-world zombie survival looter shooter that made its debut in 2011 on the PS3/Xbox 360. Set on the fictional island of Banoi, just off the shores of Australia, this once beautiful beach resort has turned into a blood-soaked battleground against hordes of hungry infected.

[b]Personal Connection and Nostalgia[/b]

When Dead Island was released, it felt like a dream come true for many of us. It was a game that shook the world and captured the imaginations of countless players—including mine. Prior to its release, we had other great zombie games like Resident Evil, Dead Rising, and COD Zombies. However, Dead Island brought something new to the table—the atmosphere, gameplay, characters, and story were a breath of fresh air. I've had the pleasure of experiencing this game on the PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, and it has never disappointed.

[b]Modern Era and Gameplay[/b]

In comparison to its successor, Dying Light (from the same developers), Dead Island feels a bit clunky and weighty. You're not a superhuman in this game—you're just an ordinary person who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But that's precisely what adds to the charm. While it may not match up to modern Resident Evil or Dying Light 2 in terms of mechanics, it excels in other areas. The game's beautiful landscape, humorous and sometimes silly characters, gripping story, and immersive sounds create an atmosphere of death and survival that captivates players.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]

Please note that my review is based entirely on my opinion, and I respect that yours may differ. However, if someone claims this game is bad, they're simply mistaken. It's scientifically proven to be one of the best zombie games ever made in history—check the books.

The Dead Island Definitive Collection is definitely worth buying. It includes everything the original games offered but with improved graphics and other enhancements. While I'm a thrifty shopper who advocates waiting for sales (especially in Australia, where game prices are often high), I would willingly pay the full price for this gem. With hundreds of hours of gameplay and the ability to enjoy it with up to four players in co-op, Dead Island is a fantastic experience. Even if you don't have friends to play with, there are still public lobbies where you can join other players. While there may be a few bad eggs who kick you out, you might also stumble upon lasting friendships, just like I did.

So, take a break, relax on the beaches of Banoi, and enjoy your drink. But always keep an eye on what lurks in the jungles. Dead Island is waiting to provide you with an unforgettable zombie adventure.",1572356968,1685748035,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

and from a point on (which is very soon) you realize you got nothing interesting in front of you. you keep grinding killing zombies + some look alike activities (sometimes driving is mixed with action but meh) over and over again to progress and collect achievements.
you got boring NPCs which give you the quests and all of them are a copy paste of each other.
you kill zombies, run out of stamina, wait a little,
continue killing zombies, your weapon breaks, you repair it,
again continue killing, some zoms are powerful so you die
then you upgrade your weapns and continue the same loop.

Aside from the lack of gameplay variety, you're forced to endure the same awful story with all 4 characters if you want to get all achievements. I can't comprehend what kind of sadistic prick came up with these piss-take achievements. It's not enough to level up one character, to be able to withstand a dozen of waves in arena mode, you have to do it with all of them! The only good gameplay element is the gunplay which can't be relished until you're deep into the story and selected the right character to actually make the firearms useful. The weapon system in this game is just designed to be as annoying as possible. Just when you get enough money together to upgrade your weapon, it becomes useless one quest later. While the player received plenty of level-ups in a short time span, the weapon does not. You have to throw away weapons that were previously overpowered because they turned to utter shit. How about giving the player an option to adjust the level of the weapon to the character by spending some money? No, that would take more than two brain cells to figure out. It's because of this very reason that even late-game weapons become less effective permanently when you start a new game+

The story and characters can go straight into the bin. There isn't much of a story to speak of, you just jump from one NPC to another, deceiving you into believing that there is some kind of narration unfolding. The devs clearly had no plan whatsoever which becomes obvious given the minimum amount of voice acting from the main characters. The only redeeming aspect of the story was the expansion in which you get to play as the supposed antagonist of the game, allowing you to view the blank canvas that is this game's story from a different perspective. But even all that aside, this game has some of the most annoying enemy types, worst environmental designs, awful AI, and frequent bugs I have seen in a while. You will constantly run out of stamina, meaning that you get shoved to the ground everytime you find yourself in a fight. You can't run or hide due to the open world's terrible design and invisible walls. You often find yourself blocked off by the most infuriating special infected I've ever had to witness in a zombie game. You sometimes even die randomly when the game decides that you've squeezed yourself into a place that you shouldn't be in. 

And the arena. My god, what were these devs thinking adding that? Scratch that, what were they thinking adding achievements for this shit? It obviously wasn't tested properly. Enemies get stuck in the level geometry or die to some random bullshit in the distance. The map that is supposed to be the 'easiest' is a major pisstake while the 'harder' ones are significantly easier. On one particular map I just randomly died because I got stuck apparently, in a late wave mind you. Nobody would even bother with this mode if it wasn't for these mindless achievements. I even had the displeasure of grinding this game mode for a completely unrelated achievement which is otherwise pure rng. Speaking of grind, it sums up the game perfectly. You're just grinding to become more resilient toward enemies but that is always short-lived. The melee combat quickly starts to grind my gears after a while. Especially the feature that allows you to throw your weapons is a total fucking mess. You have to manually pick up your weapon if you manage to find it that is. You can actually lose your costly weapon if you're not careful enough. I just can't stand these awful design choices. And you know what the worst part is? I bought the Dead Island bundle. Meaning that I have to play the sequel of this pile of shit too. My torment will never come to an end.",1685234347,1685234347,False,2,1,0.389120221138000488,0,True,False,False

𝑫𝒆𝒂𝒅 𝑰𝒔𝒍𝒂𝒏𝒅 is a mostly mediocre game made fun by co-op.

I played this game back in the PS3 days and decided to give it another go for nostalgic reasons, and while I still had fun and enjoyed it a lot, this gaming has some glaring issues.

Firstly, the good stuff:

I enjoy the gameplay a lot. I love jump kicking zombies, I love crafting mods and I enjoy looting unique or exceptional items. I think the concept of having a zombie outbreak in a tropical island is fantastic and it definitely stands out. I am also a big fan of co-op, and this game encourages it immensely — 𝑫𝒆𝒂𝒅 𝑰𝒔𝒍𝒂𝒏𝒅 is a lot more fun when played with friends. This remaster looks beautiful and definitely does the game justice.

The combat can be frustrating at times but it also feels rewarding — using a machete to cut the zombies' heads off, cutting off a thug's limbs, or setting a horde of zombies on fire with a Molotov does something to me. My co-op partner called me a sadist!
The DLC arenas are also very fun and enjoyable and I am glad they are included in this version.

Finally, even 11 years later, that intro is still sick.

Now, for the bad stuff:

If you are looking for a good story, look elsewhere. This game's plot is atrocious and so is most of the voice acting. Even the cutscenes are badly put together and the facial animations leave a lot to desire.

The soundtrack is a bit of a let down as well. Besides the trailer theme, Sam B's 𝑾𝒉𝒐 𝑫𝒐 𝒀𝒐𝒖 𝑽𝒐𝒐𝒅𝒐𝒐 and a very small percentage of the in-game tracks, most of it is very generic.

In terms of world-building there is not much either. The collectibles do not enhance the lore at all nor are they fun or interesting to read. All side quests follow a recurring pattern of fetching items, saving people, and escorting survivors.
There are also quite a few side quests called ""continuous events"" which award you XP for delivering certain items to the quest giver over and over — I did not see the point of this at all and found 99% of them to be useless.
I completed all the side quests, but by the end of it I could not stomach it any longer, and I started skipping most of the dialogue, which was always the same.

𝑫𝒆𝒂𝒅 𝑰𝒔𝒍𝒂𝒏𝒅 is also infested with bugs, not just zombies. All this remaster did was enhance the graphics (textures, lighting) but they did not bother to fix actual gameplay issues, such as:

• Suddenly dying for no reason (sometimes because of being stuck between objects)
• Losing items in your inventory
• Bugged achievements
• Clunky car controls on keyboard (many times the car will not turn and you crash)
• Funky textures in some rocks
• Clipping into solid objects
• NPC's blocking the way
• Waypoint not showing the path on the mini-map (not sure if this one is a bug but I would have to reposition it)
• NPC's you have to escort suddenly going back the way they came from while you wait for them to return
• Zombies grabbing you while they are on the ground
• Aim assist cannot be turned off, which makes aiming with the mouse considerably annoying
• NPC's and zombies floating mid-air, sometimes getting stuck
• Sound bugs

A lot more stuff like this happened during my playthrough but I cannot recall it now.

Another negative point is that the characters do not interact with eachother as in, for example, 𝑩𝒐𝒓𝒅𝒆𝒓𝒍𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒔. There is no gameplay dialogue between them, and they barely speak to eachother during cutscenes. Their voice lines are also not synced when playing online, so you rarely hear them talk, and when you do, you and whoever is playing them do not even hear the same voice line.

In conclusion, I think 𝑫𝒆𝒂𝒅 𝑰𝒔𝒍𝒂𝒏𝒅 is a fun game with a few shortcomings. I have a nostalgic bond with this game and I will always cherish it for the fun times it gave me, and I do like the combat, so I can never not recommend it. However, I do strongly suggest that you play it with friends, as it makes it a lot more fun and less of a chore.

Shenmue 1 and 2 have better story and believe it or not, better movement. Buy Shenmue 1 and 2. Picking up items may as well not be a feature, as I have better time picking up items in Feeding Frenzy than a triple A title.
I played a game called Grand Theft Auto 5. You can jump on tables in that game. You cannot in this one. On a real note, This game was made by a passionate team, Although the game is complete dog water, They still tried. The result is irrelevant because the effort was there.

Graphics is improved.
Still, colors are bad (too gray) and it's better to disable chromatic aberration.

Speaking of game itself, rather than DE.

Characters.

4 character to choose.
1 DLC character for DLC short campaign.

Each character has his / her own class.

Purna is specializing in guns.
In mid-late game, when guns are everywhere, she will be very useful.

Sam B is blunt weapon guy.
Good anti-zombie horde character.
I think he's the best choice if you play alone.

Xian Mei is a sharp weapon chick.
No guns skills, which all other characters have.
Worst choice for single player.
Too bad I picked her...

Logan is throwing weapon expert.
Balanced well, according to skill tree stats.

Zombies.

Different types of them, from slow classic zombie to fast Butcher, who use his own bones as weapon.
You can cut hands, legs and head.

Locations.

Sunny resort, city, sewers, jungle, prison.

Co-op up to 4 characters.

Custom craftable weapons.


Now the bad side.

Game is mostly close-combat oriented.

Weapons break too often.
You can't main one weapon, unless you plan to repair it regularly, but it can cost a lot.

Combat is not very good.
Timing is important here for special attacks or at least it was, when I played as Xian.

Gotta be honest, I've heard a lot of good (and some bad) about this game. What I can say is that the controls (movement) are awkward and stiff, combat is a hassle, controlling the vehicles and actually getting them to respond your your inputs when you press a button is a nightmare.. I could keep going on.
I wanted to play this since I enjoyed Dying Light and wanted more of that Zombie Survival action, and have not found it here. Even the story is lacking considerably as it mostly boils down to fetch quests for the survivors.

Dying Light was not a revolutionary experience, but it was a great experience. And I had a lot of fun with it. The combat was nice, the movement was smooth and generally more polished. Dead Island feels stiff, and awkward to handle.
I'm just not sure what to say. It's very stiff and awkward to handle when compared to other games I've played in this genre.
If you want story, comfortable gameplay and characters you feel for then I whole heatedly recommend Dying Light.

This definitive edition is legit trash. The best thing about the game was arena mode. However when you play arena with friends a bug that cause bodies to respawn and not despawn properly plagues your matches. This is only a mild annoyance until you find out that due to this bug you will constantly crash at later waves in arena. Making arena unplayable. Arena seems not affected by this if you play by yourself. However it's much better with friends but due to this bug the game doesn't work. Other than that another complaint I have is that these dumb fucks devs nerfed electric power mods across the board. Remember the Homerun Baseball Bat? A special weapon that made enemies fly away. Well now it's useless. How did the devs have time to nerf weapons but didn't patch or update the best feature arena in any way?

I bought this game because I played it for a short period on the Xbox 360 and thought it was fun with how long I played at the time and with the fanfare it got afterwards (mind you, I only got through the first hour back then). With this being a remaster, the reviews on it being positive, and it was on sale at the time, I thought to finally try my hand at the game and play it all the way through this time. 

The beginning of the game was just as I remembered and still enjoyed it all the way through Act I, once Act II began though, my desire to play the game decreased as the issues with the game and the story for me became apparent and didn't cease until I finished the game, or because possibly, even worse. Firstly, the story is very boring and has absolutely nothing going for it in the way of learning about the characters, creating emotional bonds with any of them, or really anything that a story should endow upon the player. The side missions are completely and utterly useless as they do nothing with the story and are usually just fetch quests or following companions to certain points on the map. 

Speaking of those following missions, this is a game that will have the player walk slower than the NPC, but run faster than the NPC moves, which is frustrating with how often you are doomed to these mission types.Now with missions and the story over, lets talk about the actual gameplay. For a game where you hack and slash as well as shoot zombies and human enemies, they did a poor job of ensuring that it feels responsive, fun, or even unremarkable. Melee weapons have issues with not swinging at certain times, usually when you need it most. It also has terrible hit detection and you can easily miss your target when in tight spaces even if you are aiming directly at your target. When it comes to the gunplay, I would recommend sticking to using guns only when you have human enemies (which all also have guns) as the ammo is hard to come by and the zombies are complete bullet sponges. That's not even the bad part about the gunplay, the worst part is that the aim assist (which you cant turn off) is atrocious, it will regularly take you off target when you are perfectly lined up with a headshot, which is especially important as most of the human AI will gladly move back and forth between firing and their cover so aiming is a massive chore. 

The other problem with melee and the gameplay as a whole is that there is never enough stamina to deal with large groups or ""hordes"" of enemies even if you completely upgrade your stamina through the perk system. With the gameplay issues, the entire gameplay loop is boring and monotonous with no real feeling of progression through the game. In my eyes, this game is almost unplayable without playing co-op as the solo experience is awful. Towards the very, very end of the game, the balancing becomes way more difficult at the most unexpected of times and doesn't slow down at all. I coasted through most of the game without dying a single time, but towards the end, even with upwards of 18-19 medkits, I was dying about every 3-5 minutes. Sometimes, even using the death respawn system to skip some of the most difficult sections. 

Another issue I have is that the game is still incredibly buggy even with a remaster, most noticeable is that when you carry a large item, it will get very blurry and an issue where you can get pushed and stuck in place, leaving yourself vulnerable to the overwhelming horde that probably awaits you. The only good things that the game does is that it is a beautiful game, the intro song is always a great thing to hear (it's better than the game itself), and that it. is. short.",1654480263,1684601968,False,9,1,0.512685656547546387,0,True,False,False

You can make really cool weapons by having a base weapon and then modding it with a blueprint you find and many miscellaneous items that you find everywhere.

But some melee weapons did not affect much on zombies, for instance, frying pan which is quite useless. I enjoyed using frying pan in Left 4 Dead 2 which is so satisfying to slap zombies. Also, big weapons such as hammers and axes will lose stamina easily which make the character barely move hence, zombies take the opportunity to attack and do some damage. What I hate the most about this game is I lost weapons every time I throw them on special infected and suddenly poof, they're gone. Not to mention weapons are easily unequipped and I have to equip them again.
Female character in this game like Purna for example has poor defense. But her skill was great but it has limited time so just once in a while you can use that skill.
There are several continuous side quests, for example, give empty bottles to npc in order to get Molotov but it's limited only for certain bottles. Kinda waste with extra bottles that I can't exchange it unless if you want to sell them but in a cheap price. Those Molotov are quite pricey depends on merchants. Side quests in this game were messy. It's all over the place but you can't do it simultaneously if some occur at the same place. So many repetitions, you have to go back and forth just to do one side quest. What pisses me off more that I accidentally played main quest however I can't change it into side quests back. You have to finish the main quest which is so annoying. There was this part where the npc (who have side quests for me) died and became zombies. I finished those quests but to whom should I turn into? To zombies then? It didn't make any sense. They could have blocked the main quest so the players can finish all these certain side quests then you can go back to the main quest story. Furthermore, there are still bug at Quarantine area where hoards were non stop attacking us and I died over and over that I lost so many money then which makes us so stress out. The NPCs were unintelligent, expecting us to catch up that fast to protect them and at the same we have to protect ourselves and the npcs dies and we have to do the same side quest over and over, it's so exhausting. There was one time the nps, Jin, pushed me out from the boat and I died??? We lost money every time we died and that death was so unnecessary. Overall, the gameplay, the plot, everything were quite messy.",1684050366,1684050366,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The tropical island is both unique and immersive, something different from your typical zombie apocolypse setting. The story is engaging enough to keep players interested, but the real draw of the game is the satisfyingly brutal combat. That being said, the game can feel slightly repetitive at times. Though, the game's upgrade system and variety of weapons and skills help to keep things fresh and interesting.

Overall, Dead Island Definitive Edition is a solid choice for anyone looking for a fun, action-packed hack and slash game. Its age doesn't detract from the gameplay, and the updated graphics make it even more visually appealing. While it can be slightly repetitive at times, the game's addictive combat and upgrade system make it well worth playing.",1683817486,1683817486,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

the character design was amazing, i actually felt like i needed more from the characters and the game always gave me more 

the game was released in the early 2010s and for a game of its age it performs pretty well
cons- 
the game had a lot of blur on some of the characters which made it hard to take screenshots of the main cast.

not a lot of variety for weapon mods and they were hard to understand.

When it came out it was banned in my home country of germany. Since it was finally released last year or so I have been looking forward to playing it with friends. How wrong I was.
The thing that I immediately disliked is the controlls. It feels floaty, unresponsive, like your character is sliding on ice skates. I assume they tried to make it feel like the movement has weight to it but this certainly is no Apex Legends or any other game that does this properly. It just feels horrible. Potentially this is better on a controller but on keyboard and mouse I just hated how it felt. After a while you get somewhat used to it but it is very bad non the less.
The story and overall athmosphere of the game is also horrid. I remember the tonal shifts of this game being a point of critique when it came out, however I never would have imagined how bad it actually is. You do a sidequest for a person that has decided to leave his wife and bunker down with a bunch of prostitutes or porn-actors or whatever while walking past a NPC that cries because they had to kill their entire family. You bring alcohol to some party girl while a child is dying because of a lack of medical supplies. Some games can handle having serious moments along comedic ones. This game cannot. You can never take somber moments serious because the game as a whole is just a circus. The ""funny"" moments boil down to a ""lol so random"" kind of humor that seems to be aimed at preteens. I was constantly asking myself ""who is this for?"", ""what even is it trying to be?"".
One particular questchain leads you to a garage with a man that has been bitten and his daughter. They try to make this an emotional moment but you don't even know who these people are, nor care about them. The daughter later decides to join you. While trying to help out some obviously evil people she gets taken and it is strongly implied that she is r*aped by them. Like why on earth could anyone think that is an appropriate subject matter in such a goofy game.
It even goes beyond that. At some point a character explain that when the outbreak started ""the rich people"" (tm) destroyed the bridges so the poor could not steal from them. That is ridiculous in itself. How would ""the rich people"" (tm) do that exactly and why would they care when litteral man eating zombies are already in their neighborhood trying to kill them. One of the characters then remarks that this is like what happened in New Orleans, seemingly making a referrence to the aftermath of hurricane Cathrina. This is just so utterly tone deaf I still struggle to comprehend how no one on the dev team or the publisher objected to this. It seems to me that they created a goofy as* game and at some point in the development process decided that they want a more serious tone, hence glueing on these completely out of place scenes.
The playable characters themselves also feel a bit problematic by todays sensibilities. You have the black guy that wears a gold chain and talks like some sort of gangster rapper. The asian lady of course being a master swordsman. In short, walking stereotypes in a story that tackles themes of r*pe and social injustice. Great design choice.
When you are not engaged in melee combat there is also gunplay, if you can call it that. Lets just say that any open source, made by one guy shooters you can find plays better than the shooting in this game. The weapons feel like peashooters, the enemys just tank shots without much of a reaction like you play a ps one era game. There are multiple section where you fight humans with guns for a while. They are by far the worst sections in an already bad game.
Another ""side activity"" is driving vehicles. The driving is among the worst in any game. Give me Mario-Cart for the SNES, heck even furmula one for the Gameboy before I ever want the drive in this game again. It reminds me of the vehicle sections in Tony Hawk. Clearly some lazy, glued on ""feature"" lacking any physics, any weight, just anything. Luckily, unlike the shooting sections, the game does not force you to engage with it much. You can just walk everywhere for the most part which I would recommend.
Being this old the game also has some of the bad decisions that were common in that time. Missions where you have to protect a braindead NPC that charges into hordes of enemys. Migraine inducing depth of field effects and blurrines. Endless fetch quests and padding. Difficulty spikes out of nowhere. Unfair sections where ""suicide bomber"" type enemys wait around a corner where you could not possibly anticipate them without having died once already.
The performance of this game is also very bad considering it looks not so good by todays standard. I can play recent games likes Sons of the Forest on high without problems yet this game constantly laggs and performs terribly inconsistent depending on where you are and where you are looking at.
The weapon upgrade system feels grindy and pointless. The durability of the weapons is a joke. You are constantly forced to switch from the weapons you like to those you don't because they degrade afer like 3-5 Minutes of playing. The weapon- and character-upgrades are boring af. ""Your blade-weapons degrade 5% slower"". Yeah thanks. Really fun stuff, just don't bother with a progression system if that is what is on offer.
The nice looking locations that were in all the trailers unfortunately is only the first section of the game. After that it is of to a generic city and - oh joy - a sewer level. Other locations include a jungle, lets just say crysis this game is not and supposedly a prison which we did not see because we quit the game for good before that. I image it is more uninspired corridors.
The game is sure to milk the locations for all they are worth. It is particular noticable in the jungle which is basically a circular corridor that you walk back and forth on, over and over and over.

Are there any good sides? The melee combat, excluding the floaty controlls is decent. Having a runner charge at you and timing your blade attack to decapitate them is a fun time the first fifty times you do it. It quickly gets old though.
For an older game the multiplayer also works well. Joing in a session with your friends is easy and everyone can see the cut-scenes which is not to be taken for granted I suppose.

In conclusion, this is the worst game I have played so far this year. I am fairly certain I would have also hated it if I played it back then. Bad controlls, boring quests, grind, unfunny, gringe and in some cases outright offensive. The spectacle is engaging for a very limited amount of time. I just can't understand what people see in it. Maybe I am just an outlier given people already sing praise for the second part which seems to be just as bad...

It isn't as fast and flashy as its successor, Dying Light, but it does offer a degree of challenge that is both fair and fun, especially once gun play becomes more frequent/viable. My only large gripe is that the game is too long and becomes a slog in its second half. That won't be a problem if you're itching for 20+ hours of relatively slow-moving zombie survival action, but for me it felt a bit excessive; 12-15 hours would have been plenty, I think.

And for the price on sale its a really solid purchase. 

But what i struggled with when deciding if i would recommend it or not. 
I landed on ""NO"" purely because i had to mod the game quite a bit before i could actually play it. 

The movement feels wrong otherwise, so sluggish and uncomfortable, has weird delayed acceleration and deceleration, i had to manually adjust settings files to make it feel smooth, and whats even worse is the limited FOV its locked to 62.5. 
And the head bob when moving, and fighting and especially sprinting is so horribly over the top, that it actually gave me motion sickness and a headache after only 10-15 minutes of play, and the restricted FOV makes the motion so much worse. 

This has been an issue since base dead island, and no small portion of the player base also had these motion sickness issues to some degree, and the devs never cared enough to address it, modders needed to make mod tools to disable the head bob, and movement issues, but those tools where never updated to this edition. 

And what makes that worse is, the devs instead of addressing the issue with sliders or toggles for it, they doubled down and actually made the motions more aggressive.

SO to fix the issues i had to do the modding myself, fortunately what to edit is available on the forums if you look hard enough, the end result is not perfect there's still motion glitches and jitters but at least is playable. 

And this is why i find i cannot recommend the game as one should not need to risk having these issues and needing to fix the game themselves in order to play it.",1682401217,1682401217,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

How can I say it's bad?? First of all, it's nostalgia. I've played this ever since it came out on PS3. And during it's time, it was really good! The graphics are great, not compared to what we can do with technology now but still enjoyable. The controls are slightly laggy, such as when driving a car it does register looking around until a second or two go by & the player doesn't immediately start moving forward or backward (they slide a little bit). The gameplay itself is enjoyable, with the traditional ""Main Quest and Side Quests"" setup. Plenty of opportunity to upgrade weapons and your skills by completing Continuous Quests and simply killing zombies. I think it's super fun and worth a play, especially since it came out as a Definitive Edition.

Despite its remastered graphics and updated features, the game falls short in terms of gameplay, storyline, and overall entertainment value.

One of the major drawbacks is its clunky and unresponsive controls. The combat mechanics are frustrating and lack precision, making it difficult to engage in battles with any sort of fluidity. This makes the game feel more like a chore than an enjoyable experience.

Additionally, the story is lackluster and uninspired. The characters are forgettable and the plot is predictable, leaving players feeling disinterested and disconnected from the game's world.

Another issue is its repetitive gameplay. The missions are often mundane and follow a similar structure, leaving players feeling bored and unengaged. The lack of variety in the game's objectives makes it feel like a grind rather than an exciting adventure.

Furthermore, the game's technical issues make it frustrating to play. The game suffers from constant glitches and bugs, making it difficult to progress through the story without encountering frustrating obstacles and setback.

Dead Island Definitive Edition is a disappointing game that fails to deliver on its promises. The clunky controls, lackluster story, repetitive gameplay, and technical issues make it a game that is not worth the time or money.",1681515055,1681515055,False,1,0,0.4375,0,True,False,False

As much as an open world it feels like there is so much wrong with the game the lumping, textures, animations, sound effects, spawn kills, cash. Zombies

Jumping:
while you can jump onto cars and walls you how ever cant seem to walk onto a small curb or wooden ramp with out the need to jump onto it you think its low enough to simply step on it but nope you got to jump onto it to continue that if the game game will let you jump as most short steps specially ones near water ways with a slope you can walk to the top but you cant jump out.

Textures:
as much as the game looks beautiful on the first act seeing the ocean, trees and the old forts and the character commenting on the sights as you progress is a nice added detail but its not to last as most textures around the levels are just pixie the naps faces look bland, lifeless and floppy the zeds are the same in some aspects.

animations: 
Animations aren't too bad opening doors is a little strange like your force pushing the various doors open and closed as well as gates.

Sound Effects:
Some objects you would think to Have Sounds add to them would add some sense of a lived in area but they don't like the ceiling and standing fans you find in the lab housing area they have the sound effects of running but they are static as in they don't move.

Spawn Kills:
This is the most annoying you clear out a room thinking its safe and you quit the game and when you load back in that whole room or area you cleared out all hostiles have re-spawned i have been killed by a group of npc's with guns twice after reloading a game i had to restart the whole game as i was soft locked unable to get away before getting killed, trying to kill them first or even trying to heal but no i load in and dead it was annoying.

Cash:
why on death you lose cash i don't get it are the zeds jealous that you have to much cash stuffed in your pockets or what its not like you can do much with it other than buy parts, and what is up with needing cash to repair and upgrade weapons are you gluing bundles of cash to a stick or knife to fix it it don't make sense

Zeds (Zombies, undead)
what is the deal with those infected the charge at you and take a great chunk of health of you i know you can throw your weapon's at them but still what the f###.
the rams there messed up as well like massive bullet sponges, the bloaters easy to deal with, the floaters oh jeez not touching that with a eighty foot barge pole.

I just buy this game on winter sale with very cheap price and I am so curious about this game since I was kid and rn I am adult finishing this game so here is my review.
•	For the story I think is just like any kind of zombies game and movie, we trap on island with full of zombies and survive until we get out from that island (-+)
•	The gameplay is fun for the game was release 2013, still related until 2023 I finish this game (+)
o	This gameplay mechanic just like left 4 dead on of the most favorite zombie game, easy to learn easy to play and easy to understand (+)
o	The sprint, the hit and punch zombie is so much fun and I enjoy it (+)
•	The world I thought the first one is jut on island but they move in jungle and town to give more variation so we not bored. Good choice for not make the island only for the mission (+)
•	Vehicle additional make more easy accecs (+)
•	The side mission is so repetitive (-)
•	The variation of zombie is a lot, this was one make more variation of gameplay how to kill zombie (-)
•	Choice of weapon is a lot, like melee until heavy ammo (+)
•	Stupid npc and uselles (-)
•	Just another like general start stories and ending (-)
Conclusion : 
This game just like dying like but lite, is fun in other aspect but the other aspect like boring until endgame but for the zombie game release on 2013 is fun be played until now
And I cant wait for play dead island 2

On the flip side though, the gameplay is stale and needlessly grindy for a perk system that is basic at best. No one character feels truly unique. Just arbitrary stat buffs for weapons against enemies that scale to your level anyways. Making the RPG system added to the game absolutely pointless. Honestly I'd say if you're curious about playing this game, don't, get Dying Light 1 instead. It's made by the same developers, and branches out on every aspect of this game and Riptide, by making the mechanics feel meaningful while adding parkour to the mix.",1679770513,1680986163,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Otherwise the game doesn't hold up well at all, it's still got more bugs than a cheap motel and as far as I can tell the menu sensitivity was the only decent change, the rest were just to make gameplay more annoying and less fun, like chest not respawning unless you quit the game and restart or the just offscreen spawning, etc....

there's an entire character based aroung ranged guns, yet guns are awful, nothing was fixed, hell the bullets that fly out don't actually mean anything it's based on cross hair and bullets will hit a target but not do anything because of the way it was designed, and they removed the ability to buy guns from almost all vendors and limited them from spawning in chests like the original to like 3 chests in the game, yadda yadda, they made a game that was bad but fun into a game that was just bad and still makes no sense.

The game's graphics are impressive, with a beautifully rendered tropical island paradise that's been overrun by hordes of undead. It's like Gilligan's Island meets The Walking Dead, but with way more blood and guts.

The gameplay itself is a bit clunky at times, but hey, when you're fighting off a horde of flesh-eating zombies with a paddle, you can't really expect it to be easy. And speaking of weapons, there are plenty of them to choose from. You can use anything from a machete to a propane tank to take down your undead foes. It's like a twisted version of ""Chopped,"" but with zombies instead of food.

The characters in the game are also pretty memorable, if not a bit cliche. You've got your tough guy, your damsel in distress, your scientist, and your wise old man. It's like a zombie-themed Scooby Doo episode, but with less mystery and more brain-munching.

All in all, Dead Island is a fun and intense game that will have you on the edge of your seat (or hiding under it) as you fight your way through a zombie-infested paradise. Just make sure you've got plenty of sunscreen, because it's going to be a long, hot, and bloody ride.

And the best news of all? Dead Island 2 is on the horizon, and it promises to be even more epic and gruesome than the original. I can't wait to see what kind of new weapons and characters they come up with. Will we get to fight off zombie hordes with a flaming pineapple?

Excellent game, big open areas, lots of weapons and zombies to kill.
Scavenge stuff and craft better weapons.
Xp system and 3 trees to invest points in whatever you want to get better in.
Good story and music.
Killing zombies has never been so much fun.
But beware, enemies scale up just as fast as you. So your weapons might go obsolete fast.

Some minus points :
- weird camera movement when moving around.
- some problems moving around in the menus.
- manning a turret is complicated to leave, you have to hit all keys and hope one will exit you.
- zombies respawn too fast, I mean, you clean up a street but when you go back 1 street, every enemy is back, it's just too fast.
- sewers and prison have no maps, I mean why ??
- if you missed something then tough luck, some place you can not go back in. So be sure to explore every place with sharp eyes.",1680066640,1680066640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. the dialogue and characters/ npc don't feel like real people they feel so robotic to the point where it feels like i'm speaking to a skyrim person

2. zombies will randomly spawn in to the point where you can see them pop right into existence 

3. Missions are very confusing - i went to the lighthouse tower and found some people there and was asked to ask his friends for help and i interacted with this guy and he said if i could find some food, and there was no map marker that allowed me to do so , so i just assumed that i could go to the gas station but it turns out that i need to unlock another mission in order to do so, and i looked at my mission log (Which by the way is an absolute mess) so i had no idea what the hell i was doing. If you want to make a good horror zombie game don't add so much fetch quests to the point where its a chore to understand. 

4. Aside from the robotic npc's the story is also a mess because of the amount of stuff you have to do in it

5. some people would say this game isn't well because it is old (2011-2016) but left 4 dead 2 was released in 2009 and this game was made in 2011-2016  so i kinda disagree on that statement it doesn't excuse this games lack of quality and i know this game was made by a completely different team but they could've at least tried.

One thing i like about this game

There's lots of systems like levelling, skills, weapon types upgrades and mods, BUT they work agains the player:

Getting a level up is basically getting a downgrade for all owned weapons since zombies scale directly, but weapons need to be gathered, upgraded and modded for their power.
Modifications can grant status effects like burn, poison or shock, YET touching the affected damages you as well so it's also a downgrade at times. Especially since damage has a nock-back and visual effect, sou you can end up much worse than before.
The game simplifies most zombies to either boring or unfair-they are either slow, predictable damage sponges, or an unstoppable force you need explosives for.
Most explosives are lethal, especially to you, the grenades, bombs gas canisters and 'bloaters' easily one-shot both the enemy hordes and the player.
Useless death- due to many dangers, you can die at plenty of opportunities, and yet you respawn almost at the exact same spot, sometimes even with enemies removed.
'Parkour' is a mostly gimmick crouch through small places or jump up to vantage points, if it worked.  Crouch is only used to enter forcefully shrunken places that could have easily been a normal size. There's few obstacles to properly climb, and thenm without ranged weapons like guns or explosives, you can't really do much there either. Not to mention hit-boxes are messed up and and you can get stuck on things you can't see due to hitbox or manage to die by tripping over a pool-chair (well i sure did).
The first region gives guns few guns without purpose, since zombies don't really seem to mind headshots or need more than weapon throwing.
Weapon throwing is upsettingly close to being decent- more damage for temporary loss of weapon, but the auto lock-on is trash and still misses, works only at a set distance and picking up your weapon has lower priority than looting other things, lock you into an animation and very often displaces your hot-bar.
Interaction points are horribly small and the same for every tupe- use placed consumable, interact with special objects, pick up weapon, use gathering spot, stomp execution (skill unlock). It's a mess

You can choose from playing with 4 different characters who have their pros and cons. What make this game stand out from the rest is it's stamina mechanic. Running, attacking and jumping drains your stamina. When your stamina runs out your attacks don't do any damage and you can be pushed to the ground by a single hit. This game has some weird controls that take some time to get used to. The walking just feels odd.


You wake up in a luxury island that has been hit by a zombie outbreak. For some reason you have immunity to the virus. This makes you a key player in helping other survivors how to escape from the island.

This games plot sucks ass. I don't mind the idea of a luxury island as a setting for a zombie game but the execution in this one is quite bland. This game also has a major part of the plot missing if you don't play the DLC where you control the antagonist of the game. No DLC should contain plot information that changes the plot of the main game almost 100%.

Melee weapons also don't really take into account weapon length so for instance a wrench and a bat have the same hit-range despite the bat clearly being several feet longer. Gun-play is equally horrendous, either the Iron-sights on rifles are broken or they aren't allowed to score head-shots. Not to mention most characters aren't even allowed to store anything more then about 5 magazines worth of ammo. Watching the zombie's get ""stuck"" on simple things like barrels while funny when they are frozen mid-sprint and screaming like lunatics, from a player perspective that is just dumb. Music is non-existent, the fact that it's almost a requirement for me the player to provide my own music is dumb. Like even simple gameboy games had that down but someone didn't tell these dev's that. Dialogue is infrequent at BEST, I jumped one time because my character said something and since he hadn't spoken in the last 20 minutes I honestly forgot I wasn't playing as a mute. A lot of the skills for the characters fill like filler, Like exp gain increase's. On paper that might sound good but in reality once you hit level cap these gain increase's become irreverent meaning you wasted skill points on them.

A great many of the bugs and problems in the original version have been fixed and the definitive edition acts as a complete experience sans some jank here and there.

It can be enjoyed either solo or with up to 3 other players. The game is really fun and provides a surprising amount of environments throughout a 4 act campaign, including a resort, city, jungle and prison.

The story is simplistic and lacklustre and the characters are often obnoxious but the exploration and variety of weapons makes up for it. The game is one of the first to boast a physics system where the dismemberment of zombies react according to the type of weapon you are using. 

Each character has a set of skills you can unlock as you progress through the character levels.

DLC included is the wave based arena mode which proves to be a fun way to farm money and xp as well as Ryder Whites campaign which is fun although at times frustrating.

However with that in mind, it comes with a set of issues which I shall mention in the negatives. But in order to have the "" best "" fun in this game, you must pick the best starter character out of the 4: Sam B (Blunt Expert), Xian Mei (Sharp Expert), Logan Carter (Throwing Expert), and Purna Jackson (Firearms Expert). Which in this case comes down to Sam B because he is "" the tank "" or Xian Mei because she deals the most "" damage "". While on the other hand Logan throws his weapons which isn't great and, you always have to pick up thrown weapons, and the game mostly revolves around combat and as for Purna. You don't really get good firearm blueprints or guns until act III. Which is already 65% into the game. So unless you are playing with friends play as Sam B or Xian Mei.

Zombie killing never gets old! And in Dead Island, you get to do it with a wide variety of weapons, from machetes to electric hammers.

Want to combine your love for zombies and beach vacations? Dead Island lets you do just that.

Ever wanted to drive over zombies in a car and then jump out and finish them off with a sledgehammer? Well, now you can!

Dead Island's beautiful open world setting is perfect for exploring and discovering new things. Just watch out for those sneaky zombies lurking around every corner.

The game's RPG elements allow you to level up your skills and create the perfect zombie-killing machine. Who doesn't love a good character progression system?

Dead Island's story may not be its strongest suit, but it still manages to keep you engaged and interested as you try to unravel the mystery behind the zombie outbreak.

[i]Dead Island[/i] is a zombie themed action game. The story takes place in Banoi, Papua New Guinea. The four main characters are living a night party near the hotel, the next day they will realize that something strange is happening there. As soon as we leave the hotel, we will notice people have turned into zombies. A mysterious voice will intercede sometimes, it tells us about immunity to the Kuru, a prion that causes the transformation of islanders. That voice promises a vaccine with the blood of the immune survivors. Colonel Ryder White will negotiate with us in an effort to obtain the vaccine and extract us from the island, since he's urgently looking for it for his wife who has been bitten by one of the enemies. One last helicopter is awaiting evacuation orders. All our travel and the fight against the colonel after his betrayal will allow us to escape from the island. 

The game is set on an island based on the culture, flora and fauna of Papua New Guinea. Although the game is divided into four scenarios, each of them is presented as an open world. It is made up of the tourist zone, the city, the jungle and the prison. We can even find interesting facts about the Papuan culture. The settings look impressive, exotic, like a summer day. It offers that feeling of being a tourist in a paradisiacal whereabouts. 

The game's story adds a new element to the zombie theme: the [i]Kuru prion[/i] and cannibalism practiced on the Papuan islands. Although the characters' dialogues don't express or give an opinion of anything relevant, but the missions allow us to understand what the story is about and the historical context of the island. We start from uncertainty and as we progress we learn something from the narrative. We can notice many influences from movies (like those of director George A. Romero or Danny Boyle) and games related to zombies such as special infected and zombie types ([i]Left 4 dead[/i] or [i]Dead rising[/i]) that we will come across on our tour. As the story is simple and linear, it is easy to assimilate and digest all the narrative content.

[b]Playability[/b] 9/10

This is an action game, although it has many other elements that its gameplay provides. Gameplay mechanics take precedence over melee combat. There are some firearms with limited ammo, but the variety is concentrated in those melee weapons. We will find boxes, sellers to buy or get rid of them, as well as those can be enhanced and upgraded, add damage bonuses. We will have a work table where we can repair them and other stuffs such as first-aid kits, some homemade bombs and bait, an item that was added to this version of the game. Our health recovers with chocolates and sodas. It is possible to drive cars to move faster, since running consumes energy. With all this it makes the game quite dynamic, fluid and contiguous, whose actions are not interrupted. 

On the other hand, we can choose one of the four playable characters. Except for the character Ryder White: this is a campaign of the antagonist's own. Each of them has unique abilities. To upgrade the skills, the game relies on the levelling system. We will obtain this by completing missions as well as by eliminating enemies. In addition, each character has a special action enabled, such as a type of [i]fury[/i] that allows us to easily knock down any enemy. In this manner, this game is recommended to play with friends in order to take advantage of the skill tree in a role-playing game. The game is something like RPG, action, melee combat, looting and levelling up.

[b]Music and FX[/b] 8/10

The game's soundtrack was composed by Paweł Błaszczak. To refresh our memory he also performed the music for [i]Dying Light[/i], [i]Call of Juarez: The Cartel[/i] and [i]The Ascent[/i]. The soundtrack shows the important scenarios and circumstances in the game. Although many times we will listen to these musical pieces at certain moments, such as when being chased by zombies, that is, in the drama of the action. Or the music is presented in a timely manner in the essential acts of the plot. Each piece of music is related to some place. This occasions us a remembrance how creepy and scary it is there. That feeling appears of not wanting to return, of wanting to escape from the nightmare. 

The music achieves its intention from the dark ambient and electronic ambient music. Most of the musical pieces are suites with atmospheric content. Sometimes it adds ambient noise and harsh industrial-style tones. At other times it adds electronic music beats just like an OST from an action movie. Certain changes of rhythm allow us to experience action with fast and short cadences as well as terror through ambient music loops with long-lasting sounds. This harmonic opposition adds environmental sounds, thus offering enveloping events.

[b]Duration[/b] 9/10

The game contains 4 acts and in turn they are divided into 18 chapters in total. An act corresponds to a particular scenario. As it is an open world game on each map, we can perform various activities as well to completing the story missions. The game offers a solemn freedom of exploration, as if we were sightseeing on the island. However, the search for resources, items to improve weapons, looting weapons-meeles and currency, all of this will take us more time to accomplish the main tasks. That will make the game enduring. It has a plus: the game has a mini campaign of the antagonist, a game in which he narrates his adventure that complements a before in story. A tale whose character crosses half a city in chaos to reach a radio and contact the survivors. Another extra includes a type of arena or hordes mode with different scenarios and difficulties. Be that as it may, it is quite re-playable if played with friends and by choosing rounds with unalike characters. Although we can rarely find connected games. Online co-op mode is still supported. But we can hinge on discussions on Steam for player search. But my recommendation: exploration in every corner of the island solo or team.

With hopefully follow up games to come to the market one day.

There's even a bit of story here, it's not great and it's not bad. Most of what's in between will probably be forgotten, like it was by me the first time I've played the game. However the ending is quite memorable so there's that. But that's not the strength of this game.

The main reason for this game to stand out even after so many years is the combat system, the co-op system and possibly even the glitches that the game contains. The game doesn't take itself too seriously which leads to a better experience than it would if there was no humour, it's about mindless fun of slaughtering an insane amount of zombies with anything you can find or even your fists and kicks in the face. Join up with up to 3 other players for even more fun on the island of Banoi. 

After so many years and coming back to this game quite recently I could still remember the whole first map really well as well as big chunks of the follow up areas that are unlocked, which definitely shows how and why this game was able to stand the test of time so well.

[/tr]
[tr]
[td]
- Solid variety of available skills, weapons, consumables and modding options that don't get stale.

- Great amount of worthwhile quests that often award unique blueprints, weapons or other advantages.

- Compelling and rewarding exploration: the world is filled with secret chests, hidden quests, Easter eggs and optional locations.

- Despite its relative simplicity combat is engaging, fun and has enough momentum to keep you hooked into the action.
[/td]
[td]
- Glitchy, unreliable collision models can cause sudden deaths, thrown weapons to disappear and other shenanigans.

- The last chapter is a bland, rushed mess that isn’t up to par with previously-seen ones in any aspect. 

- The consequences of side-quests, like how characters end up, are never outlined in the ending; all your efforts will seem vain.

- Firearms are generally underpowered and gimmicky until very late game, and even then some categories are just garbage (e.g. shotguns).

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
The tropical paradise of Banoi Island, a world-class tourism destination, suddenly turns into a hellscape due to a zombie outbreak. This rather clichè premise introduces us to one of the four available characters, each with their own background, personality, voice-lines, weapon specialization and abilities. Dead Island takes place not only on sandy beaches, but also in the neighboring cityscapes, sewers, tropical jungles and more locations; there's a good variety of environments. 

The main focus is clearly not a deep story nor intricate lore: typical B-movie humor and tropes are put side-by-side with genuine desperation and saddening moments, especially in side-quests; however none of the writing is high-quality at any point - that’s fine for this type of game, though. Usually side missions have their self-contained story, while lore files are plentiful in the form of collectibles by the dozens, alas rarely exciting.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
On paper an open-world, in reality only half so. While you’re free to explore and loot to your heart’s content without forced guidance most of the time, most areas will be locked out behind main or side quests regardless. It's best to follow the main path to open them, and then start clearing side-content or explore, otherwise frustration sets in from the many quest-related invisible walls and locked gates. A handy global map displays important info and facilitates navigation. 

Fast travel is available from fixed hanging maps, and will be a boon to avoid fighting the ever-respawning zombies and bandits all the time… unless you want to, that is. Exploring the island is rewarding, as there are many collectibles, side-areas, hidden NPCs with quests and rare loot to find. Those with a keen eye for secrets and paths will definitely feel rewarded by the extra time spent. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2911411281

[h3]Progression & Quests[/h3]
Slashing and shooting your way through zombies and bandits, completing quests, discovering locations and performing specific actions will award XP, leveling your character up from time to time and award one Skill Point to assign in one of the three available paths. You may choose to focus on combat, support, utility, or mix passives as you see fit; there isn’t a huge difference to how a character plays out regardless of the “build” you choose, however, and that’s one of the main reasons replay value is limited - different builds don’t really feel like another gameplay style.

NPCs found at safe locations or randomly throughout the map, will often give chained quests that award XP, money, unique blueprints, weapons or unlock new areas. These tasks include elimination, escort, fetching X items, killing a boss and so forth - your run-of-the-mill RPG quests for short, not terrible but not great either. The rewards are generally good though, so it’s recommended to give them a go.

[h3]Combat System & Weapon Modding[/h3]
Dead Island strongly focuses on melee combat throughout, and guns won’t even be a thing until the second act. Improvised weapons at first, and then proper ones later on, will be your go-to murder instruments against the undead. A stamina system ensures button mashing is heavily punished, while hitting specific spots of an enemy like the head, arms or legs delivers different effects like stumbling, reduced attack effectiveness, or increased damage. Kicks and dodges give some utility in melee to push back the enemy and avoid attacks, however the dodge is unreliable and clunky, you won’t use it much.

All weapons can be modded with blueprints found while looting or obtained for quests. Each of these projects requires materials, also acquired from loot or bought from traders at a high price. Modded weapons not only are more durable, but also inflict passive effects like burning, electrical shock, venom and more on enemies - the better the mod, the higher the status chance. Ranged weapons are overall expensive, have limited ammo and aren’t as effective as their melee counterparts, except when facing other gun-toting enemies like bandits, in that case they’re the best choice.

[h3]Additional Modes & Arena[/h3]
An optional difficulty option will have any damage one-shot you, hardcore to say the least and only recommended for masochists. The Arena is a side-area detached from the main map, and allows you to fight endless zombie hordes in four separate locations; it’s great to grind money and high-rarity equipment at all times, but brings nothing new to the already-seen formula, except much greater quantities of zombies than you’ll face in most areas of the normal campaign.",1470150500,1675176063,True,14,1,0.693009078502655029,1,True,False,False

- Jumping over something and getting perma stuck.

- Curb stomp uses the same voice even for different characters.

- Cars respawning across the map making you run alllll the way to get another one.

- Explosive zombies killing you, sometimes they don't. 

- Curb stomp stops working in multiplayer if the zombie is moved an inch.

- Driving a car into a new rendered area will prevent you from turning, feels very terrible, always crashing into something unless you stop.

A HUGE lack of QOL

- Weapons cost a shit ton to repair.

- Stuck in a loop getting weapons your character doesn't specialize in.

- Brute and big zombies knocking you down for a long ass time. Also effectively wasting your entire rage build up.

- Guns used on zombies being weaker than on humans, pretty much forcing you to use the expensive melee, bullets are only in those human sections also.

- Leveling slows down to a crawl. 

- There's player collision and the game forces you in tunnels and very tight areas about 70% of the time.

- Story is strange and all over the place.

There are so many things that should have been patched into the game at some point like additional settings and just very simply quality of life changes that arent there. Being released in 2011 it's clear that this game was specifically made for controllers and consoles because using mouse and keyboard with these menus are generally a pain in the ass. 

The first act of this game is totally fine and easy to vibe with. Run around a resort, look for better weapons, overall just killing things and leveling up and slowly getting your character's specific build off the ground. Going into act 2 a lot of the game's designs that are frustrating to deal with become more and more apparent. Things like zombies literally spawning 5 feet from you the moment your back turns because spawn locations only care whether or not you're looking directly at them and the game no problem just infinitely spawning zombies a few seconds after you kill them in the exact same spot over and over. Zombies that just do not get staggered at all show up more often and I've had times where they rush into me and do that sort of shambling flailing attack and our hitboxes get mashed up and I literally cannot move until they're dead or I get lucky and they eventually get staggered and I can knock them onto the ground. Playing as Logan becomes a huge detriment because his whole gimmick is throwing weapons, which is generally pretty powerful ngl, but then it becomes a huge major pain to put up with because retrieving weapons becomes incredibly difficult in many situations. From an animation of your arm swinging in a cartoonish way to forcefully grab a weapon that cant be skipped to the way this game layers loot as more important than your main weapons forcing you to pick up weaker garbage that is automatically thrown on your equipment bar over the top of your actually useful damaging weapons. 

While solo play can be done this game is definitely better with friends and a variety of characters with their abilities working together. Otherwise it can be an incredibly frustrating game at times when you just get absolutely bodied nonstop by some dumb mechanic like infinitely spawning zombies while doing some of the worst escort missions I've seen in a video game.",1674396872,1674436837,False,1,0,0.496240615844726563,0,True,False,False

- Slightly better physics for npc movement (Enemies are fine)
- Driving a car still a nightmare, TPS view would be good when you enter a vehicle.
- Still can't do any side quest if you are on a main quest...why? Whats the reason behind this?
- If you track a quest while playing coop, the quest marks/directions wont appear on your friends minimap unless they track 
   the same quest, not even if you are the host.

Anyway this is a very good game zombie survival game, I finish the game in coop with my friends once a year.

very pretty
light rpg
slow melee focused combat
much slower and claustrophobic compared to dying light

Really bad pc port. Which sucks cause I played  on 360. Only added graphics settings and they don't even work. options they are missing...

No FOV option
Aim assist on all weapons on mouse (including guns)
Depth of Field doesn't turn off even when turned off in settings.

The pros:

1. Open world is a huge W. Especially with vehicles that can just plow through zombies

2. The skill tree, crafting, repairs, and upgrades were all very nice. Optimizing and min/maxing was fun.

3. There were a lot of quests you could do. There was never a time where I ran out of quests to do. Granted, some of them were boring, but I could just not do those and go do a fun one instead. Half the time I'd accidentally complete a boring one anyway.

The cons:

1. There wasn't a feeling of progressing difficulty. The zombies levels kept pace with yours almost completely evenly. I only felt threatened once, and it was because I put myself in bad position (which I ended up easily getting out of anyway). The result is the combat gets stale fairly quickly.

2. The quest descriptions are often vague and unhelpful. The main quest at one point said, ""help _ and _."" Just the two character's names. It didn't say what to help them with. When I tracked it, I wasn't given a location or a way point. A lot of the quests have similar issues where they just don't tell you where to go, or what exactly to do.

3. The game felt sleazy. It's a beach vacation so, obviously, people will be in swimwear. Not shocking. What caught me off guard is 1/3rd or so of the guys were fully clothed. Meanwhile. every. single. woman. was in a skimpy bikini. Didn't matter if you were at the gas station, the hotel, or the beach. Again, women wear bikinis. I got 0 problems with that. This game just made it feel sleazy and uncomfortable. It would have felt better if the normal clothes to swimwear ratio was the same for both sexes. But this last one could just be me.

Overall, I'd say the $4 price tag is fitting. Even then, I wouldn't buy it again.",1673819383,1673819383,False,3,0,0.491772711277008057,0,True,False,False

2) Terrible Mechanics - Same zombie types gets aggressive as you level up
3) Fetch Quests - almost half of the main story line are just fetch quests
4) level balance to character level is awful.
5) half baked game. zombies appear all of a sudden, far away zombies gets alerted first and then closeby ones. car driving sucks
6) Again plot is down right terrible, you get so many things out of nowhere, no good way to link up to the ending

The gameplay loop of finding increasingly powerful weapons to slay increasingly more dangerous zombies was fun and simple. Combat was repetitive but satisfying thanks to the gore and physics systems. The first two areas (resort and city) were gorgeous and immersive, the resort especially, and did a great job setting up a really desolate mood. 
There were some glitches and a general lack of polish that in my opinion added to the charm. Nothing gamebreaking and since death didn't matter at all I didn't mind. 
What did bother me was the nonexistent plot and the portion from the jungle onwards, which felt rushed and restrictive. Very disappointed in the lab section, it's always the part I anticipate and enjoy most in zombie games and this one was just awful, way too short with nothing interesting going on. Also the side quests were mostly boring errands that I started to ignore after a point. 
Definitely worth to pick up at a discount for a few hours of relaxing entertainment.

As far as I know there is no difficulty settings such as Easy, Hard, Brutal etc, the enemies just scale with your game development.

I was pretty content with the linearity of the main quest as I played this just to chill out and smash some zombies. I usually get very distracted when playing open world games so I was happy I finally managed to finish the main quest (because the game doesn't let you roam around so much and the map isn't so large that its exploration would distract you from your quests) which didn't happen for many years :D I liked the setting in arcs to introduce each location. 

The rooms/locations designs are pretty repetitive (though there are many unique locations which I enjoyed to visit) however I admire the details and texture of objects in there. It's a pity though that the interaction with many objects is prohibited (e.g. only specific bottles are scripted to be interactive so there are a lot of alcohol or water bottles that can't be collected though their design is the same as the interactive ones). The collectibles here are fun to discover.

I really enjoyed the weapon modifications. I also like how authors provided most ""battlegrounds"" with many different weapons and items (propane tanks etc) to offer various combat strategies.

This is the 1st Dead Island game that I should be finished first lol. Instead I played the ""supposed to be extended sequel"" of it called ""DI Riptide"". Well this time I played it alone than with friends. And actually this game sucks to do alone.
[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ At the time, this game has pretty graphics, aside some zombies model repetitive AF.
+ The 4 player multiplayer, sad this time no one play with me lol
+ The huge maps, even if its not fully open world
+ The weapons variety actually many. But some locked behind levels, and blueprints
+ The level design pretty, although most of it filled by hidden walls and un-walkable paths
+ The main story is a bit unique, most zombie games mostly virus that came from nowhere that already too late to discover, here we really find the patient zero, also some small mission playing the main villain.
[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Well the gameplay can be felt dated. Its 2013 game anyway. The movement a bit wonky. the running and jumping felt bouncy with no reason. Combat felt bland, I tought some combat mechanics actually same in Dying Light but actually it worser here lol. Riptide actually improved some of this, but still its not justified as sequels of full game. It felt like DLC.
- Driving cars really no different, all trucks no different, and it felt worse than any Far Cry 1st person driving. Car often get stuck, car steering felt like dodge cars arcade you find on piers, but glad it doesnt get damaged somehow. Also you mostly can drive anywhere since idk why the game even give us vehicles if most road is not passable by any cars. We mostly walk & run for everythings.
- The weapon mods really limiting our creativity to make weapons, and without skills durability and losing your thrown weapon really sucks especially when you fully upgraded it.
- Guns sadly sucks if you not play as Purna. They often miss, slow, expensive and now way we can upgrade how many ammo or accessory we can get. Using word ""Sluggish, Medum Fire, UInreliable, etc."" and their stats actually randomized, you can find same gun with same status/rarity/name but their stats can be better or worse. And when yoiu reach lvl 60 its the same!! WTF??
- The materials is everywhere but its taxing to find expecialyl with walking around since vehicles sucks so hard in this game, and most of it sold by shopkeeper for expensive values. And finally limiting us to make certain crafted weapons. And it's mostly sucks too, toxic/flame backfires if zombie fall to us. Shocks don't do shit to zombies, guns never get accurate except you are Purna. Farming guns need to kill humans that have AI worse than zombies.
- Switch between level have too many loading, good if your pc fast enough tho since its fast. But imagine if you PC sucks.
- The minimap on the bottom right serve nothing than make you confused, its just blanks. It really not showing what to pick or where to go. You need to find promts from game UI. Then why not design it as top compass like skyrim then if the game hesitates to tell us what layout we are walking is? So we repeatedly open and close maps.
- There still game breaking bugs everywhere. Can be solved by reloading save/restart last checkpoint/suicide but we spawn aaaaallll the way back. Escort missions is the worst in this game.
- While VA is good, the interactions is really bad, but I commend the game since our main characters speak and behave like NPC too lol. Stiff, clunky, souless and uninspiring. All of them behave the same. 100% immersions. And I think the deeper you progress the story, the more you think all of the DI team isn't a team at all and most of them either oblivious or arsehole completely.
[h1]Consclusion[/h1]
So I decided not to finish the game lol, It's really tiring grinding alone and I already have many games that need to be played that actually a singleplayer game. I will replay the game if there's any friend that want to play this game one day. Is it a bad game? Well no, but for a game that really designed as multiplayer coop game, the grinding, missions, exploring, etc. feel tedious. So if you can find 3 more friends to play, go for it.",1672414468,1672414468,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Though while the visuals still hold up with the definitive edition, the gameplay doesn't.

The second act is what feels like an extremely early prototype for Dying Light 1.
And for that, for a modern audience I'd recommend picking up Dying Light 1 instead.

Also the Definitive edition barely fixes the main problems of the PC port, no FoV slider, mouse sensitivity is a bit better but ""unplayable"" for gun aiming and the game hasn't had any mechanical improvements like balancing.

I'll tell you what, kids, the game was buggy, gummy and clunky back in the days as well. Doesn't matter how well you remember it. Doesn't matter if you played it before or not. Right now, the game has improved textures and (maybe) some gameplay improvements, although I doubt it. It feels just the same as before. The game is improved to the point that you won't feel it worst then before. That's it. And being 4 euro on discount means it is cheap. You are not robbed, or anything like that. Pls stop exaggerate. 
The atmosphere is very nice. That's what made the game soo good and nostalgic. The story is dull, but Dying Light's story isn't good as well. It's a game and the gameplay is fun. That's what matters first. You can craft nice melee weapons, you can cut zombies in pieces and you can airkick them in the face.

Now, with my friends wanting to play with me, there was one issue: My copy was delisted, and my friends had this so called ~DEFINITIVE EDITION~. I wouldn't be able to play with them with my copy because the devs/publisher did not provide me with a copy, I'd have to pay them again for it. 

Got this thing, and expecting a decent, remastered game... Boy, I was in for a treat.

The first thing that popped was the comically stereotyped characters and NPCs that were clearly supposed to be someone else. Examples: A child, voice-acted and with the model of a 30-year old woman. Two Asian brothers with the stereotypical accent, but had their models being of white males.

Then came the playable characters whose Skills are wildly unbalanced. 

- The Firearm-focused character can't use Firearms because they're either without ammo or because they are useless against zombies (multiple headshots with an Assault Rifle are like throwing cotton balls at them), specially when often bullets would PHASE THROUGH enemies without damaging them;

- The Blade-focused character has barely any XP bonus Skills, and will stay at least 20 levels behind everyone else in the party;

- Sam B is the most OP in XP Skills, will be ahead of everyone else, and will easily have the best weapons as most of the weapons you find are of the Blunt type: his specialty;

The character animations are laughable most of the time, with their dead, bug-eyed faces staring at the screen as if they're zombies themselves. The writing is also atrocious, and with characters dying when the player can't feel a thing for them. Their face textures are like from an indie cash-grab Android game;

The enemies themselves are really bugged. They can respawn in front of you while you are looking at them, about 30 seconds after you killed everyone. This will be so surprising it'll easily kill you as you're speechless. In fact, zombies in the Prison Level (Act IV) will sometimes LOSE THEIR TEXTURE, displaying a debug message on its corpse like ""please select missing skin"" (I don't recall the right message) as a bright yellow helmet floats on top of their corpses. Enemies can also run through you as you're fighting them.

Also on the Texture side, most in-game objects are mirrored, likely out of laziness. Problem is, they were so lazy they incorrectly did so, and any player can easily notice this since it's everywhere: from the dashboards of cars, to posters on walls or to the jacket of one of the MAIN CHARACTERS.

Spawning after you login back in a friend's game puts you in a different place than the one you logged off. You may have quit the game inside of a safe building, only to spawn in the middle of a horde on the street once you log back in.

Some doors ingame will be stuck in a position, you won't be able to open or close it after using them a couple of times.

The weapons are inconsistent, with most of them being locked away at higher levels, and even so, a Shotgun, Assault Rifle or Magnum are often weaker than the Wooden Paddle you're currently carrying.  A Heavy Pistol is apparently capable of holding only 9 rounds when its model is of an HK USP pistol.

The Jungle level has an unique zombie but it's extremely underwhelming and easily defeated. What is also worse about the Jungle level is the amount of invisible walls and glitchy map features that can make driving a nightmare. One moment the entire party was killed because the vehicle got stuck in an invisible object in the middle of a road clearly marked by the game's map.

Some walls in the game maps are completely missing, specially in ACT IV, revealing the broken insides of the map since it was either rushed or lazily put together.

Finally, there was the final boss fight. It literally took 35 seconds for us to finish it, and by the end of it? The game's hyped up, scary monster, was bouncing on top of the helicopter as its ragdoll glitched and threw it around like a rocket.

This game was paid for twice, for this sort of experience, and then some YouTuber will come and say it was over-hated? Sometimes players deserve broken games, lmao",1672110928,1672156690,False,8,8,0.470714181661605835,0,True,False,False

The game takes place on a tropical island that has been overrun by zombies, and your goal is to fight your way through hordes of the undead in order to stay alive. The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, with a variety of different weapons and abilities to choose from.

One of the things I love most about Dead Island is the sense of progression you get as you progress through the game. As you level up, you'll unlock new abilities and weapons that make you more powerful, which is always satisfying. The game also has a lot of different side quests and activities to keep you busy, which adds a lot of replay value.

The graphics of the game are also a standout feature. The island is beautifully realized, with a lot of attention to detail in the environments. The character designs are also very cool, and the zombie designs are particularly impressive.

Overall, I highly recommend Dead to anyone who enjoys survival horror games. It's a fantastic game that offers a lot of depth and replay value.

[h1]Two Braaains[/h1]

I had this game originally on the PS and started playing it shortly after meeting my partner. I'd play and she'd sit there watching, too afraid of the zombies to join in. So naturally I have a soft spot for this game, lets fast forward to today >>> we now have two kids.

[h1]Mini Zombie Slayer[/h1]

My son is now 8 years old (just about to turn 9) and likes age appropriate horror themes in all media however, it's hard as a parent to authentically get excited over a Minecraft mod that makes Minecraft ""scary"" when you personally have no interest in Minecraft. No matter how hard I try, it's just not for me.

Naturally, I always kept an eye on the look out for a game that we can both play that has:

* Horror themes
* Plenty of fun
* Many laugh out loud moments from an immature perspective
* Works as a good stepping stone into more mature horror media.

Dead Island without a doubt ticks these boxes, then some.

I seen Dead Island on sale and thought ""perfect"", I'll get that, let him watch it for a bit and gauge his reaction. If all goes well, I'll offer him a go. He loves it.

The story was good but they could make it better. I liked the crafting but they could've made more like wooden planks to put on the door so zombies can't break in. It wasn't really scary unless a zombie jumps up on you"".",1669635605,1671654234,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Granted, I did manage to play until Act 3 and got just under 8 hours of playtime. However, the game has crashed on me 6 times during. I was willing to just patience it out and deal with it, but it seems the closer I get to the end the more frequently it happens. Its gone from happening every hour or two, to happening within 5 minutes of entering the damn game. I tried a bunch of listed troubleshooting methods, but to no avail, so I'm just gonna have to give up.

That all being said, when the game isn't crashing constantly, is the game any good? Well in total honesty, the game is fine? If anything its incredibly average.

The island locale is very interesting and there are lots of different locations that you will visit as the game goes on. The remaster leads to some really great lighting and in some places the game has aged pretty well. Although I will note that the animations in particular have not aged very well.

The combat still feels really satisfying to this day, the levelling system is pretty satisfying and there is just a solid foundation here for a great game. The problem is in the execution. The plot is basically every zombie game you have ever played in your life, and the characters are boring/forgettable. The voice acting is also pretty bad across the board, I know I straight up died laughing as soon as I heard Steve Bloom attempting an Aussie accent. The game has an odd tone as well as I couldn't tell if I was supposed to be taking it seriously or not? You can't really take it seriously regardless because what's here is just far too shallow for you to actually care.

Really the main issue I have with Dead Island is the enemy and mission design. The default zombies are fine but the special types lack imagination and aren't even fun to fight. The armoured zombies in Act 2 are incredibly spongey. The tall buff zombies are also like this except they knock you down every single time they hit you, forcing you to watch a slow as hell animation of you getting up over and over again.

You might ask, ""Well why don't you just dodge those hits?""

Well the issue with this is that the movement is also incredibly limited and clunky. You move really slow, you can't mantle or climb at all, meaning anything taller than waist height is your arch nemesis and all in all, moving around the zombies is a right pain in the ass. This also extends to the driving, which feels really floaty, not to mention the weird delays when steering and accelerating.

The mission design is also really basic, I'm talking first time developer basic. Nearly the entire game is spent doing fetch quests for other survivors who are either too pussy or too lazy to do it themselves. You are literally just an errand boy for everyone else on the island. You'll be collecting cans, flicking switches, escorting survivors and everything else you hate doing in better games, except this is for the entire game. You know you've messed it up when the side missions and the main quests are virtually the same, both being extremely basic and boring.

There's plenty of other minor things I could pick at, like how all the characters appear in the scripted cutscene's regardless of if you're playing co-op or not. Zombies with melee weapons can absolutely drop you compared to regular enemies. Jin, who you meet at the end of Act I, is incredibly annoying and is essentially a walking burden to you. I also experienced a bunch of glitches, including npc's vanishing into the ground, the game had rain sound effects without rain being present and a bunch more.

This remaster was the gold opportunity for the devs to fix these technical issues and perhaps clean up some of the funkier mechanics. Instead, they did a lazy port of an already incredibly flawed game. All of this combined with the constant infuriating crashing that prevented me from even finishing it? I'd say leave it to rot just like the zombies, its not worth it

     You can tell the melee is what they focused on, and it plays very well, with you having to aim at the body parts you want to cut off, and having to find the correct distance to stand from an enemy to hit them.  I struggled with some of the boss type enemies, one in particular, but mainly because I have a hard time moving and shooting in this game.  And because I suck.
     The graphics look about as good as you expect them to for something that is 11 years old, and the age is also apparent in the cut scenes.  The story is average.  You can see where things are going and what you are going to have to do to progress past certain areas.  
     I only did a portion of side quests in this play through, and they where all average for the most part.  Get this for that person, kill this guy for that person, find this person for that person, let them know they are OK.  About what you'd expect for this game.  The environment scales with your level, so if you choose not to do them you won't be under leveled later in the game.  
     So if you are a fan of FPS, Looter Shooters, or Zombies, or need something COOP to play with your friends, definitely check this one out.  It's worth a look, especially if you can find it on sale.

[u]What I liked about the game[/u]
[list] 
[*]	You have a choice of four different characters, each with their own specialities and back stories. I played as Xian Mei who specializes in sharp weapons.  

[*]	You get to fight different types of awesomely designed zombies, like the Walkers, Infected, Floaters, and etc.  

[*]	I like where the game takes place. I liked exploring the resort, Jungle, and town. 

[*]	Loads of collectables, like ID cards, files, and tape recorders.  

[*]	A nice selection of weapons. I like that the low level weapons look like they are falling to pieces compared to the higher level ones which look pristine and badass. You can also upgrade your weapons and repair them. 

[*]	I like that you can drive vehicles and use them as battering rams. 

[*]	The game has a ton of side quests to keep you busy. 

[*]	You can upgrade three different areas which are fury, Combat, and survival. You can upgrade inventory space, your fury mode, weapon effectiveness, and etc. 

[*]	The gameplay is a lot of fun. I like that you can dismember different parts of a zombie’s body. The kick makes the game much easier, so make sure you use it.   

[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]
 
[*]	The voice-acting and the cut-scenes are dreadful, although they do have a certain charm to them. 

[*]	The game is has a few bugs and glitches, like items clipping through objects, doors being able to kill you, dodgy lighting and shadow effects, and etc. I had to keep switching full screen on and off to fix the lighting and shadows. 

[*]	The game is a bit too long. 

[*]	The characters stamina is pathetic. 

[*]	The flashlight takes too long to recharge. It would have  been nice to be able to upgrade your flashlight. 

[*]	Soundtrack wasn’t anything special. 

[*]	I didn’t like the idea of items respawning in loot boxes you already searched. 

[*]	More vehicles to drive instead of the same pick-up truck. It would have been nice to be 
able to upgrade your vehicle.

[*]	You can’t disable the auto-aim for the guns.    
[/list]
[u]Conclusion[/u] 

The game reminds me of the film Zombie flesh eaters, because the game takes place on an island with zombies and it also has bad voice acting. The game just need’s a cut-scene where zombies have a fight with a shark underwater. The game isn’t on the same level as Dead Rising or Resident Evil, but it is still a good game. I liked exploring the island Banio and I really enjoyed the combat.  If you like zombie games then I recommend you give this game a go.

The game is extremely buggy, in all the same ways the original was. In particular, it doesn't play nice with alt+tabbing on Windows.
For a 2011 game, it doesn't run well on older hardware.
NPCs have an extreme case of sameface, the remaster did not help on this front at all.
The plot struggles to be coherent, let alone interesting, and the main characters have no agency in it. Quest writing is similarly bad.
Dead Island's damage over time mechanics are some of the most annoying I've ever seen in a video game, to the point that otherwise cool weapons (like a fire axe that sets people on fire) aren't worth using because you'd have to deal with your own DOT effect.
Balance is all over the place in general, you probably don't even need a weapon for 95% of the first act because the E key is just better in a lot of ways. 
Level design is also all over the place: most of the game is kind of trivially easy, but you get spots where a zombie will one-shot you with a throwing knife or where you're forced to break down a door directly into the line of fire of several men with guns.
The final act is extremely short and linear compared to the previous acts, and makes the game seem unfinished.
There are several escort missions (everyone's favorite) and the NPC quality varies greatly, with some of them practically running through zombie hordes.

In spite of all this, I had fun playing Dead Island again. This game feels like an experiment in how janky you have to make a zombie game for it to stop being fun. I still can't recommend it though. $20 is too much for what it is.

[h1]Pros:[/h1] 
- very good for coop, if you can manage to get someone to play this game with you,
- numerous choices of weaponry,
- various upgrades that further increase the variety of weapons,
- number of enemies and enemy types keep the game interesting for a longer time, you don't really expect tougher enemies in seemingly normal areas, therefore it keeps you on your toes most of the time (once you get out of the beach),
- different enemy type will require you to assume a different tactic for them, also it is amazing how seeing one of the tougher enemies (Ram, Butcher) will make you instantly go ""oh sh*t"" when you least expect it,
- skill tree is actually useful and allows you to pretty much have most if not all of the perks you would like your character to have,
- nice touch for a zombie design as going from beach through city to the jungle you can clearly see the difference in former residents (now zombies) in form of their outfit, this helps to maintain the immersion somewhat,
- the same goes for the music, it changes with locations, 

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- firearms are pretty much a no-no until you reach the city, prior to that good luck finding any ammo (unless you found a recipe to craft bullets),
- game feels clunky, especially in combat when multiple zombies swarm you, if you are unlucky you will be dead there and then,
- floaters are a joke, particularly when the game decides to place 3 of them close together then make you walk back through the same section and fight them again, 
- respawn rate of enemies is ridiculous, you can literally wipe many areas to go for a mission, fulfil requirements of it just to go back and clean the same area once again - and then again if you were tasked to do something within that same area,
- NPC escorts... seriously, i was thankful for checkpoints as AI of escorted characters decides to fight 4-5 or more zombies on their own, just to be killed and make you restart your mission,
- placing suiciders right behind the door that you have to break through is a d*ck move,

[h1]Side notes:[/h1]
Story falls apart once you reach the jungle, until that point the ""disease"" making zombies was a mystery and had a curiosity factor to it, when you realise why the outbreak happened it's more of a ""is that it?"". Also the very ending of the game, instead of having a great ""reveal"" of whatever was going on, or whoever was behind it all - all you get is a generic boss fight.

In general, the game kept me going because there was a clear progression through the campaign, however most of the main quests were really insignificant in terms of impact on the narrative (i like to think that if i would be trapped on the island like that, my main goal wouldn't be to go to the petrol station risking my life for two boxes of orange juice). Characters were also exaggerated, especially Sam B and Logan, but hey i get it. 

Still, regardless of all the cons - THIS GAME IS AMAZING WITH FRIENDS!",1648252741,1668551853,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1668127731,1668127731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am amazed at how well this has held up, game runs amazing and the graphics and animations are top notch. If this released as a 2022 title at say £20, Easily worth the money. 

If you have not played these games I 100% recommend grabbing some friends and playing through the story, you can do it with up to 3 other players.

-Zombies kept clipping through walls and got stuck in the most ridiculous way. 

-Weapons constantly degrade to the point where i ended up using my fists until i could scrounge up enough cash to upgrade. 

-By the 3rd Act you'll constantly be running into Zombies that will pretty much require you to have guns in order to deal with them properly. 

-The driving mechanics are shit on a shingle. 

Basically it felt like left 4 dead but turned into an open world with a quest system instead of plowing through linear levels. I would only get this if you love Zombie Survival games and dont mind a lack of polish.

If you are a fan of DEAD RISING, DEAD ISLAND will definitely taste good :)

Playing DEAD RISING in first person but more limited outside of the game has its advantages, combining different weapons and items with each other multiplies the fun of killing zombies.

You are free to enjoy your vacation between all the zombies, either alone or in a group, and help the survivors who need help and get rewards!

Its systems are outdated at best and there are tons of bugs prevalent throughout the game. Facial animations are offputting at best. With that in mind, even given it's flaws the game still manages to be fun. Weapons feel like they have real weight to them, and every hit feels good. The mods are pretty cool, though I wish there was some crazier stuff you could craft. Fighting zombies is the best part of the game, which is why it's a shame that the game feels like it constantly keeps you from doing that with too much talking and too many fetch quests. 
       Aside from that, if you want a good story, you'll be disappointed. The game fails to make you care about any of the characters and all of it's attempts at emotional appeal tend to fall flat. 
       Even with all this, it's still a lot of fun. Fighting zombies is a lot of fun. I recommend playing with a friend and if you really have an interest in the precursor to Dying Light.

Somewhat comprehensive parkour, weapon customization, truly satisfying combat, fluid controls and a story that... exists. A lively community and a very enjoyable experience, especially when playing during the night cycles. Especially especially, if you use a mod that lengthens the night cycles.

Dead Island, however, has no parkour (unless you count creative jumping), has clunky controls, does not have a day and night cycle (although it does rain in Moresby now and then), combat that is pretty straight forward and the story is.... in beta?

This may start to sound like a full knock against Dead Island, and to some extent, I can't really suggest this title to those without a certain level of patience or younger than a certain age (some of us are old enough to remember when EVERY game had terrible controls and acting), actually try this game. However, I can honestly say that while it is a thrill to run from Volatiles and stunt drive through the country side, eventually you become accustomed to the Volatiles AI, fully level Crane and become an unstoppable force of parkouring, fashion sinning, cliche'ing, repeatable event doing, super dropkicking, and bored Hero.

Dead Island, however, has never ceased to frighten me. Much like in the original Resident Evil, Dead Island will keep you guessing even after hitting it's level cap or NG+ simply because the controls and how the character moves can put you over a barrel if you are not careful. You can never become over confident because the game will constantly throw tons of the undead at you and no matter how powerful you are, Butchers will leave you rekt.

In these years of playing DI across several platforms, there is still a sense of dread and giddiness I get when booting up this gloriously fun fireball of a train wreck. Just don't play this for the story. It's not enough to put me off the game, I can see what the goal was, but as I mentioned above, it clearly wasn't finished. Rather, what shines here is the collection of massive sandboxes, the eeriness of the ambience, and laundry list of quests/missions.

As I said, Dying Light is a grand game. It's the safe choice. You get what you pay for, that is, a zombie game with melee and parkour focus, plenty of content and a finished (if predictable) story. However, if you enjoy the gaming scene from ""ye olde"" times and all their frustrations, if you have a certain level of patience, if you enjoy never feeling so powerful that you can go make a sandwich while the game plays and come back to room full of dead zeds, and you can find the mute option for the depressing music, you may find this to be a worthwhile experience.

As you might be able to tell, I am conflicted about this game. I want to recommend it because I love this title and it's flaws. However, looking at it metrically, it is a shoddy product. Especially for it's time. I think if you are still a zombie freak, you will get some good times from this. If not, well, play it safe unless you absolutely do not mind wasting a bit of time and money.",1588039837,1665575613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Progression is exciting and the developers clearly put a lot of effort into making the world as interesting as they possibly can. I love the idea of tropical paradise turning into hell and there is a variety of different environments to explore. 

However, the game is reluctant to let you enjoy the fun part, killing zombies. It has all the tedium of the survival games that were popular back then, an era which I’m glad we have moved on from. The story and cutscenes are really bad, but not the funny kind, just sad. Although I love the environments, the game is visually really ugly, and it hurts my eyes.

There are a few chars to choose from each with their own playstyle.

[b]A: [/b]Yes, definitely!

First of all, I want to say that I used to play this game when it came out, back in 2011. the original one, not the definitive version. It was a great game back than, unique for that time. I used to play it whole day, every day. It was great looking game, great combat and exploration, nice leveling system. I met so many good friends online playing this game and Riptide later.
I came back to the definitive edition game (this one) after so many years and after playing Dying Light (DL from now on). I was surprised that there are still players online. I was expecting bad graphics but it still looks great. Even better than the original, the graphics still hold up. It is still a gorgeous looking game and fun to play, must say maybe even better combat system than DL.
Great scenery on a remote island, beaches, palms, sea, mountains... You can drive cars, you can travel on foot, explore abandoned buildings and help survivors that you discover travelling on the map. Tons of a side quests to do, you will need to help a lot of scared people and make them feel secured. Main goal is to escape the Island.
Best part of a combat system is that you need to find weapons, upgrade them, make them even better, repair after and try to find better ones. Sure, you can find guns later in the game and became terminator, but still, hand weapons plays the big role in this game and make it so much fun. [spoiler]You can literally chop body parts of a zombie![/spoiler]
For the end, you can play this game online or over Lan, up to 4 players. Chat and voice system are supported and it can be really fun.

I love Dead Island and it was one of my first Zombie games that I ever played on my playstation 3. In 2022 Dead Island cannot stand on its own two feet as it is dated so that means whatever is flawed here... other games like it do it better nowadays. 

Pros:
● A decent story but it lacks finesse 
● 4 player coop
● Several explorable maps, if that's your thing
● Crafting/modifications to your weapons
● Collectables 
● Graphics are much better compared to the original version of Dead Island

Cons:
● You get body blocked by teammates. Collision is on so if your friends are standing in a door or a random is... most likely they are trolling you and they will ruin your experience.
● There is no manual save in an open world game of all things.
● Cars can get stuck, zombies get stuck and you get stuck in pretty stupid locations.
● Mainly a melee based game but yet there is no ""BLOCK"" option with weapons.
● When you run you get this ""Blur"" that made me feel sick... there is no option to turn it off.

TL;DR/All in all:
Dead Island Definitive Edition is a great play if you have some friends to play it with. If you play with randoms... it will be a troll fest of them blocking doors and killing you. I would however recommend this game as I love the game and it is a MUCH better improved version compared to the original. 7.5/10.

It's fun enough, especially for $5 on sale! Go get it. 
 I got my money's worth by the time of this review. By kicking zombies in the junk until they die, I save thousands on repairs, as my shoes never get damage it seems.

 I suggest turning off ambient occlusion, along with blur, because it makes the game a blurry mess, and hard on the eyes. It looks crisp enough if you turn this off.

White DLC, there's also a LOT of collectibles and many of them are missable which makes the game more replayable and interesting, sadly in this definitive edition version of this game there's also some glitches and bugs that weren't there before, one of them is the collectible document Banoi Herald Excerpt 33 which is inside a building that's basically impossible to get in. The different characters with all their different skill trees make this game very replayable and there's even an achievement for playing on all 4 characters. The weapon modding in this game is pretty much top notch when it comes to modding melee weapons, there's a ton of different blueprints to find and test out. The open world is also fun and pretty unique I can't name any open-world where there's a tropical resort area with a luxury hotel, a city full of slums, jungle with a hidden laboratory in it and a whole prison island in one single open-world. The soundtrack/music score is also pretty good and fits well in the game overall.

In terms of combat - you wouldn't be able to find a challenge here. You can kick and slash your way through every level with ease. Throwing your weapons is quite OP, however half the time you can't find them afterwards. And guns are only good against humans.

The best thing about them is that co-op play (a highlight -- and, for me, a must-have) is integral; whereas you could easily lose a dozen hours trying to get a multiplayer game going in the original.

'Dead Island' gives players the sweaty, gritty, greasy experience of being stuck in the videogame equivalent of an Italian zombie splatter-house film, alla Fulci or Argento.  The world is open, but segmented for story purposes, and you can foot it, or drive, and even attempt limited parkour -- which the follow-up series ('Dying Light') took as its new direction.
Sadly, combat is stuck in a 'Digital' option, which lacks the enjoyability of the original game's 'Analog' mechanics -- and simply turns combat into a button mash, as you go lick-for-lick instead of deftly combating flesh-eating nasties.

Also, it's worth noting that players must finish the single player prologue before multiplayer options are unlocked.

Beautiful vistas, stunning graphics, great combat, entertaining ragdolls, huge open maps to explore, astounding environment control, great paced music, fun weapons + modifications. 

If you haven't played this classic gem yet, I highly recommend some good old Zombie slaughter with some friends. 

Even if you don't have friends, its a truly great time.

If I have any complaints, its this; The city section of the game is trash. Its design is repetitive and boring, its a real let down after how well done the first section/act is and feels. Zombies can instant kill you with zero effort by throwing weapons ... as if a zombie ... with rotten or eaten limbs, ligaments, muscles etc as well as rotting eyes (they are the first thing to rot after death) can accurately throw a knife/plank/cleaver/whatever they have picked up as accurately as an expert knife thrower and they will ALWAYS go for throwing their weapon as the AI knows it's an instant kill. 

This problem doesn't show itself in multiplayer within the city as the zombies attention is divided and groups are quickly dispatched but on your own, which is how the game is played by the majority especially now after a decade or more, it just becomes a very boring running simulator for the entire second act if you don't want to die continuously to expertly thrown weapons by walking corpses. It honestly sucks all the fun out of the game. Seriously, I die to thrown zombie weapons far more than thugs, rams, suiciders, bloaters or anything else combined and there isn't anything you can do about their aimbot throws. 

It doesn't even feel like the same team of dev's worked on these two areas and they certainly didn't talk what so ever as NOT ONE zombie will EVER throw a weapon at you in the first act but can hold and swing them, which makes at least some logical sense and I have zero problem with, but aimbot walking corpses are obnoxious and just honestly terrible work by the dev team.

1. The graphic, when char is talking i think the mouth just like slurred speech or something. Sometimes the animation of nearly anything, just sucks. Kicking, punching, throwing stuff is just bad. Sometimes when i kicked zombie, the animation bug lil bit and what i see is zombie glitching in front of me :(
2. UI UX is just SO BADDD. I mean, idk why but the cursor on the menu just felt diffrent. I never felt a cursor so weird but this one. The interface just bad like they just put it everything they wanna put. The icon design, workbench (literally just like reading novel, no graphic at all) The map system, if u wanna drag the map, u have to use right-click (correct me if i forgot) and i find that really annoying for adjusting the map.
3. The quest system just arrange chaoticly. I just bought the item for a quest but when i got there, i just cant give it cause i find another quest on the road. Idk how they did the quest system just so bad...
At the end. i just played this game for 2 hours or so

Open world is great but there isn't a real persistent feel. Any container that isn't a locked chest can be looted every time you log in. Looking for more of a ""cleared this zone already"" result from me tearing through.

Dialogue is painful, thankfully it can be skipped. I'm absolutely certain I ran an errand to find a teddy bear for a hot, mentally disabled girl wearing a bikini and I don't know how I feel about that.

Love the way that the difficulty progresses as you move through the game. Not just the zombies themselves but also environmental challenges are layered in.

Probably the biggest crime of this downgrade is the fact that the devs spent actual time fixing stuff people would use for xp farming and helping to get achievements easier yet didn't seem to fix a single bug and in fact introduced many more. Most importantly for me, THEY ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED SHOTGUNS, like they aren't even worth using at all anymore, they just straight up suck, it's hard to comprehend just how bad they are now compared to the original and why they felt the need to even touch them never mind release them in the state they are in, i have no words for how stupid it feels to pump 6+ shells into a zombie and it's still alive.

It's been rebuilt using dying lights engine and it just sucks, the lighting is awful, graphics are better at times yet worse, faces look hillariously bad at times, like Jin is more horrifying than the zombies when you have to look at her when accepting quests. The god awful aim assist is still present which makes it near impossible to line up head shots as it keeps focusing on center mass with absolutely no method to turn it off.

It's honestly a worse dead island than the original for me but you can't get the original on steam anymore.

Mods will fix most of your problems but you currently cannot mod out the aim assist nor can you go back to the better physics engine the original had instead of the crappy dying light one.

I hate Dying Light, loved Dead Island, when you mix the two together you get a very subpar Dead Island. The only reason i still recommend it is because it's still ultimately Dead Island and the only one you can get on steam. I'd honestly recommend buying the original over this downgrade edition,

Dead Island is an amazing FPS Zombie game that will give you tons of fun but always leave you feeling like you've accidentally skipped a few cutscenes if you try to pay attention to the weak story. It's not perfect and has tons of room for improvement but it was a refreshing and amazing title when it released.

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

The publisher of the game is the company Deep Silver. The game is based on the Chrome Engine 5 engine and presents the player with an open non-linear gameplay, as well as hand-to-hand combat in the first person and the possibility of cooperative passage of the story campaign.

The player controls one of the four surviving characters. The main task of the player is to move around the island in search of other survivors, as well as perform various tasks. The main goal of the game is survival, so the player will come across all kinds of useful items: money, water, food and others. All this is necessary for survival, as well as for completing tasks and creating weapons.

The game implements a realistic manner of the character's behavior. The character has an endurance scale, which is spent while running, jumping or hitting. When the scale is empty, the player becomes vulnerable for a few seconds until the scale is replenished again. The weapon has various parameters: the force of the blow, the effect on the character (how quickly he will get tired) and others. As the weapon is used, it breaks down, losing its properties. Therefore, weapons need to be repaired on special workbenches. There you can also improve it, as well as upgrade it.

During the passage of the game, new parts of the island and types of enemies will be opened. As the player progresses through the game, he will gain experience, and for each new level one point of skills, which are distributed in one of three branches: the first branch of rage allows the character to fly into a rage and subsequently improve this skill, the second branch is responsible for the combat skills of the character and the possession of his type of weapon, and the third branch helps to survive in the game with its help, the player can slowly regenerate health, get more money, open locks and be more resistant to attacks. Each hero has his own skills, abilities, weapons, rage and style of play. The player can distribute skills as he pleases.

The game also has a cooperative mode. Any player can freely find a suitable game in the lobby, having an Internet connection (always except for the prologue, the player must pass it on his own). You can invite friends to the game. Progress is saved only if you play according to your progress, looking ahead, you will have to start from where you left off.

This game is just not very good. Hacking, slashing, and slamming energy drinks for HP is fun for a while, but the story is just so laughably incoherent and poorly written that any immersion or attachment to the characters and setting evaporates immediately. The combat is actually pretty fun, but the skill progression is boring and somewhat poorly designed, and the side characters and quests are incredibly bland. That isn't even mentioning the myriad of bugs that I ran into - and I don't know if it's because it's ported to the Dying Light engine, or if they were just in the original game.

The Definitive Edition DOES fix the catastrophic game-stopping bugs that the original PC version(s) had that literally prevented some players from even getting past Act 2, but the game just hasn't aged very well and when held up next to it's successor Dying Light it just becomes so painfully apparent that this game is effectively a tech demo.

Put simply: it's rare for me to not finish a video game that I've spent money on; I like to give games a fair shot and have the 'full experience' playing them. I was very, very tempted to simply turn this game off and stop playing it about halfway through, and the only reason I didn't was to finish the playthrough with my friends.

The controls are kinda heavy feeling for today's standard and it has lots of glitchy animations.

The crafting and looting are simple and easy to navigate, the UI is kinda edgy in my opinion tho it is still on theme, the weapon deterioration adds to the immersion and the leveling system is kinda ahead of it's time.

Positives:
- Beautiful graphics, I really liked all environments except the city
- Great sound design, adds to the scariness and tells you what zombies are nearby
- Overall scary but fun high intensity gameplay
- Perfect to bring friends along
- Reasonable price

Negatives:
- Sometimes unfair, especially referencing zombies that will one-shot you by hiding within a group and throwing a cleaver at your head
- Ridiculous bug where sometimes bumping into other players or objects can randomly cause you to die (I assume fall damage calculations going funny). This is really bad because you lose thousands of dollars for every death, but it only happened to me 2-3 times in 20 hours.

And we can definitely see a progress Techland has achived.
Setting in Dead Island is great and can be close for everyone: summer, island, vacation, sea/ocean, hotels, bungalows, sun and relaxation :)
Co-op experience is very good, haven't noticed any problems. Game is not hard, more like enjoyable. Playing it with somebody does not ruin the experience.
Visuals are OK, setting does it's job :D
Story is a bit on a weak side, so you can look at Dead Island as at linear co-op based game, where you can have some fun, with basic story supporting your journey.
You can choose from several characters, each has it's own speciality and bonuses. You have skills and levels here, so some sort of variation is present. You can drive cars, shoot from guns, not only meelee is present.
The thing I don't like so much in such games (including Dead Rising) are weapon crafting and it's constant breaking. I could not care less about this this aspect of crafting. You have perks that increase your damage with specific weapons, like 2-handed. But in order to use it properly you have to either look for them (good luck) or craft them, which means look for resources to gather. And your weapons are breaking pretty fast, which makes this process a bit not worth it. Some weapons can be fun to use and look at, but I'd like less loot, less weapons, but more meaningful with more durability.
To sum it up, Dead Island is like a prototype of Dying Light without parkour and with everything a bit more basic :)
Story-based co-op games are not very common, so I can definitely recommend to add Dead Island to you collection to enjoy with friends!",1657010990,1657010990,True,27,1,0.713730096817016602,0,True,False,False

The story is uninteresting to say the least, and full of cliches and nonsensical bits.

The gameplay is repetitive and clunky, with no actual progression or significant development.

The engine itself is glitchy as hell, I've had several (5+) points in the game where I either had to force reload from checkpoint or I straight up died 'cause some NPC squished me into a wall.

What little fun I had was thanks to my coop partner, and that couldn't last for very long in such a terrible playthrough. Looks like this is the game Techland went back to to get inspired while making Dying Light 2.

Turns out it is not miserable.

Frankly speaking it is not bad for a 2016 game. I focus on the main missions (some side missions are on the way so I did them incidentally) and the story goes pretty fast and straightforward. It is a typical zombie outbreak story but happens on a vocational island. The protagonist gets up from a beachside hotel, quickly finds other survivors and they work together to get out, with some interesting set like the invisible blood from the tribe and the vaccine from the lab. Game has 4 chapters, within the progress player gets to visit the town, sewer, jungle, lab and prison. Other missions include temporarily area, the map is rich however not very into details, and big.

Good for players to go fast travel, certain main missions ask players to drive cars or follow companions. Those are tedious, driving feels boring, the cars don't take damage nor break down objects. Running over zombies can be fun, but not exciting because they cannot hurt you even if the car gets stuck. The distance to drive is too far, the good thing is the waypoint is clear. Following a companion is regular, make sure to protect this NPC otherwise it is a game over.

Most of the missions are simply going to point A and get items. For me I am familiar with The Walking Dead and have played The Dying Light just several weeks ago, I can almost guess what is going to happen in the game. The fun part is to see the island scenery, and the mechanics to beat up zombies - they don't come in swamps like The Dying Light or L4D, but they are everywhere and I need to stay alert, but not all the battles are necessary and zombies stop chasing after a while. In later game guns are available, missions will include battling people with guns, which are very challenging compared with zombies, the higher level they are the longer health bar they have. However, more than 2/3 of the game I go with melee weapons. Players level up by gaining exp, to unlock more weapons and skills, those are regular.

Maybe back 5 years ago Dead Island was one of the best zombie killing games, in my 7 hours gameplay I do not feel major advantages or disadvantages. It is not a horrifying game, the most horrifying thing happened when I talked to a scientist but stood too close and I got to see his eyeballs.",1655799917,1655799917,True,20,14,0.656299173831939697,0,True,False,False

cant say is good, cant say is bad either. its a meh game.

i quit the game many years ago cause it was buggy.
thought of it and replaying the game recently and it was still buggy but not that bad.
you get punch a few times you died in early game, 
you still died from a few punch at the end game.

Story is a more depressing take on the zombie genre. While a little over-saturated now, in its time that story clique was in its early peak. The story presentation comes off as a little awkward, but the main themes and story beats are still clear enough for your brain to fill in the blanks and become passionate and care for it. The combat is a little clunky and hard to adjust to, but much like Silent Hill it works in favor of the game with it's themes of mortality.

Found A Cheap Deal On Trivago For This Place And It Was Amazing... Sure The Guests And Residents Are A Bit Clingy And Always Want A Hug But I'm Into That... The Hotel Can Be A Bit Loud During The Night... Noisy Neighbours Always Screaming And Crying... Alot Of People Moaning As Well... Unsure If Its A Cultural Thing? Who Knows... If You Love Energy Drinks This Place Has Alot... Energy Drinks Around Every Corner... As Well As An Assortment Of Tools And Weapons Just Lieing On The Floor For you... Would Rate This Trivargo Destination 4/5... The Moaning And Screaming Gets Tedious...

Nah In All Seriousness This Game Is Great... Would Recommend... 

Great Graphics And Visuals Paired With Smooth Controls Makes This A Great Open World Zombie FPS... 

The Game Can Bd Quite Stuttery At Times When Loading In New Areas But Kept Above 60FPS In Max Settings...

A Couple Of Small Issues Now... The Achievements Are A Bit Tedious... Some Take A Few Hours To Complete,.. Other Take Minutes... At The Time Of This Review (2.4 Hours Played) All I've Done Is Ran Around Collected Weapons And Done The First Misson...

PASSAGE OF TIME

It´s 2022, and I have just finished the main campaign of Dying Light.

So, with all my experience gained from playing Dying Light, I´ve decided to give Dead Island Definitive Edition a second chance, and now it´s been so much more enjoyable, because I can use the tactics and tricks I learned from playing Dying Light. [spoiler](why waste ammo/weapon on a zombie when you can simply kick them?)[/spoiler]

WARNING: this game is roguelite. I´m trying to go from one checkpoint to another and, every time my character dies, he loses all the ammo he used at that attempt, but the number of enemies remains the same. That is quite UNFAIR.

Another thing that I don´t like is that, about middle-game, they make you run though the sewers, like, four or five times. Not only the sewers are such recurrent, boring paths in horror, surviving games, I was liking this game exactly because it took place in a parade-like resort.",1650511459,1653599551,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For starters, the PC port performance is abysmal with mass amounts of screen tearing or framerate drops, either it isn't optimised for PC at all or is biased against AMD hardware. While on the topic of the PC port, I would like to mention the fighting mechanics are absolutely ruined with most button strikes not being registered, making combat difficult. Adding to that difficulty is the severe lag induced by however the multiplayer is handled, with desync so bad that it's easier to walk everywhere and avoid vehicles at all costs (unless Vertigo Simulator is something you're after). I enjoy the premise of the game, a classic zombie slasher with a really fun visual aspect. I'll admit, bashing heads in with a crowbar is done better in this game than any other. This, however, is quickly ruined by your stamina (or lack there of) as you're constantly forced to pickup every energy drink in a 10 mile radius just to keep combat moving, if you run out of stamina mid battle then you're SOL if multiple zombies are attacking. You're essentially helpless when knocked to the ground, left to die and forced to restart. I had high hopes for this game though, the graphics are good and the idea is sound. I figured, being an older game it's probably just the PC port that is bad - boy was I wrong. In hopes of more fluid combat and smooth framerates, I installed a copy onto my PS3. At first it seemed better, the controls are more intuitive and the cutscenes/light areas were rendered very smoothly. This quickly changed during the first mission, any more than two zombies will bring the PS3 to a sluggish halt as it chugs through loading assets. The combat is a bit better, button presses are actually registered and it becomes easier to push zombies away. However it still retains the awful stamina, leaving you fightless in a seige of undead. It seems every character in this game is an obese whale with the fighting ability of Mike Tyson that's only limited by their diet of processed sugar and xtreme energy drinks. Surely, I thought, it gets better at you level up and improve your skills. I was wrong, skill points are seemingly only dished out every nine thousand kills which quickly leaves your character severely underdeveloped for the majority of enemies you'll battle. What could've been an excellent hack and slash beatemup is really a grindfest runaround with most missions quickly becoming repetitive. The only accomplishment this game holds is giving false hope then smashing it right in front of your face as it forces you to suffer. Would not recommend, even for free on a PS3.",1653251648,1653251648,False,12,1,0.508816719055175781,0,True,False,False

The game lacks a gripping story and intriguing characters to keep the curiousity going. The side content is so far detached from the main plot, that when I came back from doing side missions, I often forgot what the story was about. On the plus side the combat is very satisfying and there is some beautiful scenery/nature graphics, although even this gets monotonous after a while. Money could have been better spent on a better game, but I am not mad about it (would not refund).

I like the game but it was too tedious for me to do the side quests and feel that they were not used for anything other than to level up and get money. The weapons they gave you for doing those side quests usually didn't work for me because of the low damage they did.

The skills don't feel so satisfying to unlock either since it was usually things that went unnoticed like doing more damage, depleting less stamina, increasing the time of rage, things that were hardly perceived as in other video games where they give you new forms of attack or mobility.

The maps are very pretty but they don't feel dynamic. The zombies help keep the locations relatively entertaining, and the beauty of the maps makes you want to explore them but you quickly realize that your curiosity is not rewarded by finding almost nothing. In addition to the fact that the spawning of the zombies could be annoying by having to kill them going from point A to B, but having to kill them again going back. Also searching the bags ends up getting repetitive and throwing your weapons dangerous because they could ""disappear"" (fall somewhere incoherently far away and maybe impossible to reach).

Something that I really didn't like is that the game is made to be played in cooperative and if you play it alone, the other characters continue to appear in the animations behaving as if they were always accompanying you when they weren't.

But even with all its details, the game entertained me long enough to finish it. But probably because of the melancholy of having wanted to play it since I was a teenager.",1652160707,1652160707,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

  Played the game back on release coop with my dad but did not finish act 4 and never played riptide and these 10 hours reminded me why. 
 Played right to the end of act 2 and almost every sidequest where quest items need picked-up are broken, 2 resets to pick up necklace, gas cans can't be placed after 3 resets...  and oh my do I not like any character in the game, either neutral or hating them for realistic reasons.
 While graphics are overall pretty good the blindingly bright sun while driving and few other smaller issues are obvious and take me out of the game each time.

My recent stay in your establishment was certainly what one could call an ""experience"".
What was suppose to be an all inclusive weekend ended up as another energy drink and pills fuelled bender.
With no other form of transport available, I was forced to drive intoxicated all over the island until a man took things into his own hands and banned me from driving. 

Staff were incredibly rude and constantly jumping down our throats.
I was very disappointed to find that the swimming pool was NOT deep enough to jump from the second story and the sunset ocean cruise was a real downer.

Some of the sites were remarkable but the locals were seemingly very hungry.
Petrol prices were ridiculous, had to pay an arm and a leg!

But despite all of the above, I found an amazing man who DIDN'T have a terrible Australian accent.

Played the majority of this game solo back in 2011-12 but now I was able to experience it all over again with a close friend who never played Dead Island before. He loved every bit of it which brought joy to me so for sure I encourage people to play this with friends. It's fun alone but you'll get some great laughs alongside others.

i definitely remember my first run of this game I was so scared because lets be real, a lot of us were younger & the idea of zombies at a young age was TERRIFYING lol. Still as fun as it was in its prime!

It's too bad Techland transferred development of ""Dead Island 2"" to another team in order to focus on Dying light. Hear me out though, even Dying light is fun and gives you the same feeling as Dead Island almost but with extra mechanics of course.

It was pretty damn good and for a short while made me live with a delusional hope that a zombie game could have a deeper meaning and innovative plot. Then I've started playing this title and found myself on a big map inhabited by dozens of bland NPC task dispensers. I know it was crazy to expect a good story with freakin’ undead in it, but getting a plot molded from a bunch of quest briefings was a LETDOWN OF EPIC PROPORTIONS. To this day Dead Island’s narrative approach gives me the feeling of disappointment like no other game.
 
For what it’s worth the titular island is BEAUTIFUL. The level design is great, with sprawling areas, multiple settings, and many GORGEOUS LANDSCAPES to admire. It looks incredibly interesting and overwhelms us with the urge to explore every nook and cranny to find pickable items. In most cases, we gather giant amounts of various junk for the game’s CRAFTING SYSTEM, but sometimes we stumble upon a hidden quest, a blueprint, or a weapon crate, which makes it all worthwhile. Overall exploration of those gargantuan levels can be quite fun.
 
Guns and ammo are quite scarce, so combat is mostly MELEE-FOCUSED, but honestly, it’s better this way, since that’s probably the best part of the game. The impacts of blunt weapons throwing undead away or slices of our sharp blade decapitating enemies in a brief slow-motion are INCREDIBLY SATISFYING MOMENTS. We can also customize the experience with various weapon mods and character upgrades, ensuring further that it won’t get stale too fast. So, for the most part, the battle is thrilling… but unfortunately, the magic only happens while we’re fighting low numbers of foes. When facing more than 2-3 zombies each confrontation quickly becomes chaotic, with no time for the subtle approach. We are usually forced to go into the fray and click frantically on our adversaries until they change their alignment from vertical to horizontal - at which point we perform a little Riverdance on their faces to finish them. To make things even messier someone decided it’s a good idea to display damage and XP values right in the middle of a screen, so the enemies during battle are constantly vomiting out colorful numbers with a happy out-of-place font, making big encounters look like a zombie episode of Sesame Street. 
 
Exploring and combat are fine core mechanics and the gameplay could be just oscillating between these two with great results. Alas, we have a third, hidden one, which I’m going to call Miscellaneous Management Crap. It’s basically WASTING OUR TIME ON VARIOUS SCREENS to optimize our combat proficiency. Weapons have the durability of a potato chip, so we have to find a workbench to repair them every few minutes. While we’re here, we might as well upgrade them… Probably craft some enhancements as well… The amount of space for weapons is limited, so perhaps we should drop/sell some of them… The constant inventory tweaks we need to do are infuriating and the UNINTUITIVE INTERFACE doesn’t make things any easier. 
 
Dead Island is first and foremost a multiplayer game, but whether you’re better playing alone or with some people is debatable. COOPERATION IS ALMOST NONEXISTENT, with the only difference other players make for us is providing extra firepower. Unlike other titles there’s no enemy here that can permanently immobilize us, so we can always fight alone - in the worst case we die and lose 10% of our cash, which is never a painful thing. Heck, you can't even use your flashlight to light things up for others (that one detail caused a lot of anger and confusion during the playthrough with my group). It's as if developers were completely determined to cut down interactions between players to a bare minimum, perhaps to help us immerse in this pandemic feeling of isolation.
 
I’ve played Dead Island twice: the original in a “solo mode” and Definitive Edition with a bunch of friends. To be honest I’m not sure which way of playing is better. It’s definitely a unique multiplayer experience since co-op games usually tend to provide shorter segmented missions rather than a giant campaign (this one takes 20-30 hours to complete!), but it’s usually hard to finish it with the same squad in a reasonable amount of time. Both modes are providing a similar amount of fun, so you should just pick the one you’re most comfortable with. But if you’re looking for something besides killing brainless zombies in swimming suits, you should probably keep on searching.",1648990226,1648990226,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, the lack of parkour is sorely felt. Your character feels like a crippled snail and is too lazy or fat to climb on anything that any normal person would be able to. Fall in the wrong crevice and you might have to reload. To say Dying Light is a massive improvement is an understatement.

The setting is amazing. I'm a huge fan of tropical settings and zombies so it's only natural that I'd love that aspect. People say the city is boring compared to the resort but I also love urban areas and I really liked the desolate, ransacked, gloomy feel to it, especially when it's raining. It also helps that it reminds me of Harran from Dying Light (for better or worse; once again, the lack of parkour bogs it down). I also really like the voodoo elements. I feel that's a lost influence behind the zombie genre and it's nice to see some homage being paid here.

I like the protagonists and wish they felt more involved. They don't feel as alive as, say, the L4D survivors. They kinda just feel ""there"" and it's a shame because they have colorful designs and backstories. The side characters are okay I guess. Nothing special but interesting enough. Voice acting is hit or miss. It's amusing to hear the more recognizable actors like Steve Blum and Yuri Lowenthal put on cheesy accents.

Combat is also pretty janky. Some hits feel like they should land but don't. Your character is also stiffer than the corpses so it leads to many unnecessary hits being taken. Animations are also hilariously bad, like what the hell?

This game aged poorly and Dying Light is better as a game period but I prefer the setting and aesthetic of this one. I wish it were polished more. This ""Definitive Edition"" would've been amazing if there were lengths taken to tidy up all the jank and maybe add in a parkour system similar to Dying Light; at least one that lets you climb on shit. I know it's unrealistic for Average Joes to be doing all these insane leaps and whatnot but this whole game is inherently unrealistic, so it wouldn't hurt to make a more fluid movement system. I'm bad at ratings so I'd say this is like, a 7/10.

The story is god-awful and poorly told through cut-scenes and cringe-worthy dialogue, but the combat itself is what sets this game above and beyond the competition. Slicing, stomping, kicking, and blasting walkers never gets old, and you'll be doing a lot of it. 

The definitive edition fixes some glitches from the original and looks and runs like an absolute dream with almost non-existent loading times. Recommended to anyone looking for solid, slow-paced hack-n-slash combat who doesn't mind shitty driving mechanics and retreading their route to complete missions.

Beyond the aforementioned 3 hours of fun laughing at how terrible the game is, you may have some fun with a save editor making terribly overpowered weapons.

I've noticed two things: 1 - The game shows its age and it has weird FPS drops and its noticeable even with V-Sync. Nothing game breaking but it is showing its age and how the game could use some more optimizations. 2 - You can see how this game inspired Dying Light. Its core elements are there.

I completed the main story and explored most of the game areas. The game includes a lot of references to pop culture and also plays on a lot of Zombie-Content stereotypes. The story is simple to understand yet familiar in the sense that it follows cliche zombie story. Its fun nonetheless.

If you are like me and picked up the game after playing Dying Light 2, it might be worth your time.

1. Unnecessary changes to models - Normally I wouldn't give a damn about visual stuff, but there's enough symmetry going on with character models to make the developers behind the From Dusk Til Dawn game blush. Have you SEEN the back of Sam B's shirt?! And Jin constantly looks like she bathes in lotion.
2. Weapon mods with distinct visual designs replaced by generic Unity-tier assets - Find a photo of the original Phoenix axe mod, then find one in DE or make one. It's literally just a basic 3D fire effect you can get for free from anywhere now.
3. Rare yet extreme glitches - My friend especially encountered two instances, where in one, he continued his file and spawned miles above where he saved last. Another, he was just exploring around the jungles when it started lagging suddenly, then loaded a bunch of stuff, and the game thought he threw his weapon away, out of bounds. I have yet to encounter anything that wild, but I can believe it considering the closest I've come is getting stuck in the ground and being unable to get revived by my friend, or dropping items and being unable to retrieve them because... who even knows.

Buy this at your own risk, preferrably on heavy discount. Even more preferrably, track down a copy of the original version (AKA non-Definitive Edition). Get multiples.

It's a game where you're encouraged to make headshots (I mean, zombies), but you aren't allowed to aim at the head. There is a non-optional auto-aim that locks on to the torso. The best you can do is wait for the lock-on, then move your mouse up before you throw, but once the game is locked on, you lose your crosshair. That means you're aiming blind.

And I'm playing Logan, the thrower. He specializes in throwing knives and knife-like accessories. When you throw a weapon, it auto-equips the next weapon for you. The problem is that the game doesn't give them to you in equipped order (If you throw slot 1, it doesn't switch to slot 2 next.) Instead, it uses some screwy-ass logic that, if your quick bar isn't full, switches to your strongest weapon. And since you're throwing your weapons, your bar is almost never full. That means that if (as is the case with me), your second or third strongest weapon is your melee weapon you keep in reserve for when you run out of knives, you will throw one knife, then switch to your melee weapon. Every time. That means that you have to fire once, then manually open the wheel to switch weapons, then fire once, then switch, then fire once, etc. If you're faced with a bunch of zombies, you invariably end up throwing your backup melee weapon at them, leaving you helpless.

And when you're done, you have to scour the entire battlefield to find your weapons, one by one, before you can continue.

Act I is okay but beyond the end of it, the game becomes slow-paced and repetitive. And I have come to realise that I've been fighting the same zombie types over and over, all while walking around the city (driving a car around the City of Moresby is a pain in the ass). I mean, the enemy variety in this game feels a little too... how should I put it, narrow? And multiplayer barely did enough to make gameplay more interesting-- it only serves to speed up the progression.

It was fun beating, slashing, punching, shooting, burning, shocking and blowing up zombies while it lasted but now, after having beaten this game, everything has become so... boring even after I change to a new character.",1646222870,1646222870,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I do not know where to start from...

I guess I will start with the story.

[h1] THE STORY [/h1]

Without giving any spoilers, you basically start of as an immune survivor. (A cliche that has been used way too many times by now.) And of course, people want to use you as you are the only immune person around. NO ONE in this game will EVER do something for you before you go around and kill some zombies for them. This gets so annoying after about 10-5 hours because you need to walk about 300 meters to kill 30 zombies and grab some thing and come back just to progress through the game. Yes, side quests are mandatory if you want to finish the game's story. Not like 100% or anything, just the story itself.

Some people might like this, but for me it gets exhaustingly overwhelming after some time. Since every quest basically asks for the same thing but on different locations and with different enemies. You go grab/do some stuff then return back to the mission giver. (No variety, at least I don't recall any fun side quests.)

Main quests are actually fun, except for when they aren't.

Later in the game, the main quests start to have same objectives as the side quests. Go grab this for me/escort me to here etc.

Also some of the quests actually force you to do side quests as I've said. ""Go around the [Location] and help people."" At the start doing one quest is enough and it doesn't really get overwhelming. But to the end it's just like this:

[i] You do a main quest, then you need to do 2-3 side quests to do an another main quest. [/i]

Do this about 5 times and then you move on out of that location.

I feel like I could go on, but I should move to the other aspects of this game.

[h1] THE GAMEPLAY [/h1]

The mechanics are overrall pretty good, the combat is pretty fun until it starts to become overwhelming. You can only use one type of melee weapon, and that is the one your character specialises in. Blades, blunts and so on. Though, you can use other categories of weapons but you won't get any bonuses because that isn't your character's weapon type. So it will attack really slow and get you exhausted really quickly. Talking about exhaustion, each time you perform an attack move, your stamina goes down and eventually it will empty. This is a good mechanic, this isn't what's so bugging about the combat or the game in general.

Aside from using the weapons that the game gives you, you can also add modifications to these weapons. It can range from burning the enemy to just increasing the weapon's DPS. This also allows you to create explosives and/or baits. 

Then you have the zombies. Because, well, it's a zombie game. If you are going to have a zombie game your zombies must be having good AI and are fun to fight against, right? I guess the developers though the answer is no because that's certainly how they implemented it to the game.

The zombies get stuck in places, they always follow you and there's about no way to run away from them without killing them all. (Except for the walkers, they move rather slowly.) I am not going to rant about how hard they are to kill, they aren't. It all requires skill. It's more so that they can hit you from far away and while you are running away from them. They can also kill you while you are climbing a ladder, which is infuriating sometimes. 

Then you got the special enemies. The game gives you no hint on how to fight them, except for the exploding one as it shows a cutscene of it exploding. Some of them are impossible to run away from. I personally don't like stopping every 2 minutes to fight a zombie so I tend to run away. But with some of these enemies that is not possible.

It's not that they have a lot of health and hit really hard. They just aren't fun to fight against. 

The thug (Some buff zombie) has a lot of health and knocks you out every time it hits you. Though, it moves pretty slow. Fighting it, though. It's pretty annoying.

Since it knocks you over everytime it hits you, you need to not get hit at all. That is achieved by jumping away every time you hit it. Do this in about every 10 minutes or so and you get bored quickly. As some of these guys aren't avoidable at all.  He also has a lot of health so you need to hit him like 10 times. 

The Ram, basically the stronger version of thug which has about 10 times more HP, is basically bulletproof, and run faster than anything else in the game, is even worse. 

You can kind of avoid this guy except for when you can't. You are forced you to kill him about a few times in the game. He runs slowly until he starts charging at you, so that's good.

Combine these enemies with constantly spawning zombies who never leave you alone in anywhere you go, and you got the streets, the beaches, and the jungles of banoi.

[h1] THE ENVIRONMENT [/h1]

The game is set on Banoi, a fictional island that is located in the Papa New Guinean islands, located south of equator, north of Australia. 

It is a good place, though since it's crawling with zombies it's basically hell.

The map is pretty good, there has been put a lot of effort into the environment of banoi. As this is not a real place I can't really compare it to it's nonexistent counterpart. But I guess I could say it certainly does fit the theme of pacific islands. With all the jungle and the exotic beaches. 

[h1] LEVEL DESIGN [/h1] 

Unfortunately, the level design can range from good to mediocre.

Usually it's just big open spaces, but indoors always crawl with zombies. Usually they are just full of zombies, a few weapons and or ammunition. Then after the room of zombies, there are always health pickups. This can go for outdoors as well, instead of rooms it's just sections. 

This repetitive design gets boring and overwhelming like everything else I've talked about so far. The combat, the story, the enemies and so on.

[h1] TRANSPORTATION [/h1]

The game actually allows you to quick travel between key locations. And [u] mostly [/u] you will have a car parked by these locations so you can travel easier. (Some locations just don't have cars so you need to walk.)

These cars are pretty fun to drive, I honestly feel like this game has better driving mechanics than gun mechanics. The cars have smooth controls and handle pretty well. They can also run over zombies, which will insta-kill them no matter what type of a zombie they are. (Use this to kill buff enemies.)


[h1] EXTRAS [/h1]

This game also has a co-op mode but I can't say much about it because my friends don't want to play with me.

I won't be talking about the graphics because I played at the absolute lowest, though I still doubt that there being giant square particles is due to low graphic settings.

I haven't experienced many bugs besides of zombies getting stuck like once or twice. Nothing game breaking. This game also works with the Dying Light engine so you will need DirectX11 or higher.

Quest givers literally yelling at me for 5 minutes pissed me off so early in the game. I take a quest from them, and before I leave to complete it, they ask if I have done what they wanted. And if I just ignore them, they will try to gain my attention by chatting about random stuff everytime I walk by them. An icon on their chest and a blip on the map is not enough apparently.

[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]

This game is pretty mediocre. Though it is not THAT bad. I'd say you should buy this and riptide while they are on a sale.

This is my personal experience of the game, so I suggest that you read more reviews if you are really unsure.

[spoiler] Thank you so much for reading until the end. I hope you have a great day. [/spoiler]

[u]First, about the game itself. [/u]It's 10 years old. But it still looks great, plays great and sounds great. I played original version a lot on release. And after so many years I launched it again after playing Dying Light 1 and was pleasantly surprised by it's quality - it's still cool. There is no parkour but that's not a bid loss. 15 minutes in and it was already hard to stop.

Key aspects of this game are setting and gameplay. What can be better, than brutally smashing zombie heads on the paradise island? And the scenery - scenery looks simply breathtakingly. I should also specifically mention music. Years ago I somehow didn't pay much attention to it, but today I can clearly state that it's great indeed.

Compared to DL, here you have 4 different characters to choose. And man, their playstyle differs significantly. At first I didn't pay much attention to this aspect. Years ago I played orignal as Purna, Riptide as Purna, and recently I played this version as well... as Purna. And at first I kinda thought that probably I'm fed up with the game for now. But than I checked other characters and simply rediscovered the game again for myself. It's really interesting to check different character. So if you are going to play, make sure to check at least 2 of them.

[u]Now let's talk about Downgrade Edition[/u]. Yeah, basically it's just a downgraded version of the original. Sure, there are some improvements, but I can't call them improvements as such. For example, there are some sporadical improvements of lighting and shadows. But such improvements often ruin initial concep rather than improve. 

Let's say, there is a scene in a Lifeguard Tower, where some huge zombie is eating up his poor victim. [b] Before[/b], this location was rather dark and had some weak and flickering lighting. Zombie had more sinister look as well and the whole scene was more spooky. [b] After[/b] they ""improved"" shadows and lighting - this location looks bright like some ballroom. And zombie looks so pale like some aristocratic lady from Middle Ages. Clearly these ""improvements"" were added just for the sake of improvements, simply to justify existence of this Downfall Edition. 

And that's not all. What's even more important - in the Defective Edition they carefully saved all bugs from the original and even added new ones! For example, chests in this game always contain some weapons. After you reenter certain location or reload the game - it's content should be refreshed. The problem is, lots of these chests are bugged forever: once you retrieveded some weapon from it, you won't find here anything ever again.

Bugged quest with Nikolai for example. I played it 5 times and 4 times I had a bug when Nikolay decides to go back to initial location after he almost reached final destination. Once he decided to go back twice! That's not critical but still annoying. If you meet zombies who are turnt back to you, almost in 100% cases they will run away from you right into the wall or even through the texture. In prison some guards are stuck in the wall, so you can see only their hands. And also the ball...  that damn ball... You can't kick the damn ball anymore! I know it's not a big deal, but still. Was it some complicated alien technology from 2011, so it is not awailable for developers anymore?

In the end, if you never played original game... I still recommend you to get this Disgrace Edition. Why? Because it's still that cool Dead Island in the core. And it's still very fun to play. If you never played original, chances are you'll never consider abovementioned problems as such.

[u]Now my favourite part - local community.[/u] And it's hard to call it sane. But I can already see your scepticism. Fair enough: you don't know me, you can't fully trust me. What if I'm just one toxic dude, who is blatantly slandering these fairy and innocent people? Come closer - I have little something to prove my words.

You see, just like many games on Steam, Dead Island also has achievements. And ve-e-ery rare ones as well. You are probably guessing right now what can it be? Maybe to kill hundred of zombies with bare hands? Hm... maybe to kill a final 100 lvl boss with 1 lvl weapon? Ah, maybe to survive 50 waves on arena, something like that, right? Ha! - wrong! One of the hardest achievements in this game is... to play 15 minutes with 10 random people. 15 damn minutes. With 10 random people.

Only 5,5% managed to finish Darkest dungeon. Only 3,2% managed to finish 5th pantheon in Hollow Knight. But little did they know that the hardest challenge is hidden here, because only mere 1.4% managed to spend pathetic 15 minutes with 10 random people. I mean ""People person"" achievement. You may check it. Just imagine this situation. Why it is so? Well, because the moment you try to join some public game - you will either be kicked in 5-10 seconds wtihout any reasons, or everyone will immediately rq the session. Yes, let me repeat it once more - it's year 2022 A.D. and people kick you from public game... for joining public game.

Keep in mind, the game is very generous with it's options. It lets you to make your game public, friends-only or even private. But it seems like such technologies are too complicated for these urban neanderthals, and they like to waste your time. The moment you join their game - everyone freeze in horror, as if you sneaked into their bedroom. They even stop fighting zombies and start convulsively communicate how to kick... ehm... intruder asap.

Nevertheless, for me it is also not a reason to ruin game's rating. I'm an old hag with saggy tits - meeting lunatics and sociopaths online is not something that could shock me. But it may be an issue for you and potentially ruin your experience. This is why, if you want to play coop - check Steam forum first. It has enough good guys or even entire group of people willing to help you.

Now let's make some conclusions. If you own original game, you really don't need this Disappointment Edition. But keep in mind, if your friends have this version and you have original - you can't play together. If you are a newcomer or only played Dying Light before - I still highly recommend to get even this Dishonored Edition because it still kicks. And if you plan to play coop - finding some good friends is not a recommendation, but a necessity.",1645217164,1645217656,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I always wanted to play this growing up but being a wee little lad when it came out I wasn’t allowed, but it always peeled my interest.

The Good

-Gore holds up incredibly well, as you chop off limb after limb until they die

-RPG mechanics, really enjoyed constantly leveling and getting new stuff no matter where I was in the game

-The Resort, Morsbey, and the jungle (start of act 3) amazing locations, varying in variety

-Character classes, above all else this is easily the best thing in the game, it’s actually fun to level up a character and use the skill tree and personalize the class to your play style

-New Game, Thank god that even after you beat the game you can keep going and make your character more badass

-weapons, all the melee weapons and even the guns are awesome

The Bad

- Solo play PLAY CO-OP AT ALL COST, I played this solo (all of my friends were playing dying light 2 at the time like I should’ve been) and my god it was so boring, game would’ve became 1000x better in co-op, the way it was intended to be played

-Amount of Zombies, if this was 2011 as previously stated this wouldn’t be a problem since we wouldn’t have known what the future holds, but the lack of zombies is kinda astounding 

-Guns, yea having aim assist on pc is the stupidest thing you could ever do 

-repairs, too much money for repairs since you’re  always breaking weapons

-story, wake up, non infected, get off island before monsoon rolls in ( story really isn’t that big a deal in a zombie game it’s a very minor complaint though)

-Halfway point of the game, after the act 3 opening when you obtain the boat, it becomes very apparent that Deep Silver rushed techland and didn’t give them enough funds to flesh out this last part of the game. Deep Silver is a complete joke for this and I still despise them for their shitty practices to this day

-Quest, go to x, grab y, then return it at, rinse and repeat

-movement, I didn’t expect the movement and just controls in general to be clunky as hell


Overall: 5.5/10

If played with friends: 7/10

I’d still recommend this because techland is great, and the foundation for a great RPG is thankfully in the game, Deep Silver on the other hand go suck a fat one

you can play dead island irl if you stick some butter under your feet. bugs with no end, i don't know how they messed up the hitboxes like this, often times if you're not pretty much on top of a zombie you won't be able to hit them (ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE DOWNED), with a stick that is as long as you're tall, forcing you to kiss the zombie while another jumps on you, which makes it very frustrating, besides the uncountable bugs i immediately encountered. the original version was better. i paid 3$ for it, thank god i got it while on discount. oh btw, if you play with mouse and keyboard, you'll cry whenever navigating through any menu (and that's 50% of the game) because the devs cared so much about this new cashgrab they wouldn't even remake the game properly, yes you can fix it, but why won't you pay me to fix it? i mean, you paid for the game, it'll be more hard work to fix that issue than to make the entire game, since devs couldn't even bother to fix it. they have been quite notorious for their cheap cash grabbing tactics, in fact they just made some terrible p2w mobile games and other trash with the title ""dead island"" attached to it just to steal as much money possible. this game itself is actually a pain to play, quire literally just moving forward is a pain. pay attention to the positive reviews, because what i'm guessing is that some youtuber with a larger than life speech talked about the game positively, they're only commenting over nostalgia and following the youtubers words. i enjoyed this game many years ago, but man am i happy i'm not into this trash anymore. asked for a refund which i probably won't get, sadly, just like this game. even the original wasn't as good btw.",1645096759,1645096759,False,0,0,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

Do not buy Definitive Edition if you want a decent experience. If you can get a hold of the original, play that. Definitive Edition is a vastly inferior experience to the original game. Not only does it contain MORE bugs than the already buggy original, it seems to have appears it may have inherited the Dead Island: Riptide version of the engine, bringing even more bugs to the game. I absolutely hated Riptide and thought it was a serious downgrade to the series. Every single glitch I have encountered in the original game is still present in this version. I will be listing my observations.

The game looks good... sometimes. The contrast is incredibly messed up, making looking out from cars blinding, and interiors are pitch black. The new textures and high resolution are nice, but that hardly makes up for the problems with the game. If I recall correctly, I couldn't turn down the fullscreen resolution from 4k, so this game heated up my PC a lot.

Some characters, such as the security guard you need to look for in the hotel, have had models changed. He used to be black, now he's just a generic white guy.

The collisions on characters are messed up. Rams have collisions that make it hard to hit when using brass knuckles, and their reaction time is very slow now. They used to kick you as soon as they turned around, now they spend a few seconds standing there before attempting to kick.

The audio for many things is not synced up properly. The final level of curb stomp plays the sound at least 6 frames before the actual impact.

I have died at least 5 times by being placed in a wall or floor by the game. It may have happened once ever when playing the original, but right after Mike's cutscene when you bring him the gas, I was killed by being shoved in the floor. Then that happened frequently near the end of the game.

The Floaters used to pop when you killed them, changing to a model where their guts are spilled out. There is no new model for that, so they don't pop anymore.

Water in the sewers is the worst video game water I have ever seen. Its just a translucent turquoise plane, with water splashes that look like glitter.

Human enemies can't have their heads exploded like they used to. Another circumstance where a new model was not created.

You still cannot create custom binds for controllers. There is still only the outdated system of presets.

TL;DR
If you can find an original version of the game, play that. This version of the game is absolutely rancid and is the worst way to play it. Any minor improvements (such as graphics) are massively outweighed by the lack of bugfixing, and wave of new bugs brought into the game. This definitive edition must've been what Rockstar looked to for inspiration for their recent abomination.",1645026075,1645026075,False,6,1,0.484878063201904297,0,True,False,False

Schaurige Monster und knackige Girl´s mit einer tollen englischen Vertonung. Bin noch ziemlich am Anfang aber aber ich glaube nicht, dass noch große negative Erlebnisse diesen Spielspaß trüben werden.
Man muss vielleicht noch den sehr gut funktionierenden kooperativen Mehrspielermodus erwähnen. Das Zusammenspiel mit mehreren Steamfreunden ist problemlos und das automatische Speichern der Spielstände und das Spielen mit verschiedenen Mitspielern mit unterschiedlichem Fortschritt gelingt ohne befürchteter Fehler.
Bin einfach positiv überrascht, das Spiel leistet deutlich mehr als erwartet auch die Charakterentwicklung ist ""lustig"" und lädt dazu ein Später auch mal mit einem anderen Charakter ein neues Spiel zu probieren.

A very nice remaster, you can feel the classic background and pace of days gone by, all with a really perfect graphic upgrade.
Scary monsters and hot girls with a great English soundtrack. I'm still at the beginning, but I don't think that major negative experiences will spoil this fun game.
One must perhaps mention the very well-functioning cooperative multiplayer mode. The interaction with several Steam friends is problem-free and the automatic saving of the scores and playing with different players with different progress is possible without the feared errors.
I'm just positively surprised, the game does much more than expected, the character development is ""funny"" and invites you to try a new game with a different character later.",1644680971,1644681326,True,1,0,0.471238404512405396,0,True,False,False

They should of kept the ak's and m16's. The only positives to the upgrade are that the textures look 10x better it no longer looks like vasoline was smeared onto everything.


Also I don't like how they changed how you get quests because you no longer have a note in your hands

You can get knocked of your shoes when stamina is empty or a big foe attacks you. Dying removes 25% or similar of your money and cheat engine is needed to get enough to enjoy mid game hell cause difficulty is super high alone. Enemies are scary due to good weapon and attack impact. Game has it's rules and physics established and will not break any. For a B-tier game it is really good. Dying Light 1 increased scarcity of resources and made hiding and running more important. Both games are traditional games in the year 2022. No big markers and only on minimap you'll see ? and !. Also NPCs will visibly tell you they need help.

In Dying Light 2, finding missions, NPCs, secrets.... are all marked on the big map when roaming around. No additional information and a failure of the whole gaming industry. A new low compared to the FREEDOM of Breath Of The Wild where you get no help except in hidden tricks and tips by cleaver programming and story telling. Also Dead Island has no forced press F to continue chatting to NPCs and no press Space to skip force door opening animations and squeezing through cracks in walls.

Then I reached ACT II.

In this version you chop a arm no blood gushing down as much and it feels rather bland when you chop specific parts of the body. Not also that killing the goons in the city or jungle later on the story. You can't disfigured them nor burning them alive, seeing there skin transform into crisp like the dudes at Nam in the 60s with Napalm. I know I said three problems in the beginning but another problem is you guess it. The Melee weapons. Blunt weapons felt like are made of cheap wood and hardly do damage. Two-handed sharp weapons do eh for damage. and finally one-handed sharp weapons do a lot of damage for no reason. The durability of the weapons suck overall.

The game play is still solid, missions are fun and you get to kill zombies, the game plays better as a co-op but totally fine solo also. 

Positives:
- Graphics are stunning, good quality water, blood and other stuff
- Missions are generally engaging
- Easy levelling 
- Adaptive Combat system
- Fun weapons and mods
- Not stuck with the usual american setting and accents
- Plenty of gore, blood and fun death animations for zombies

Negatives:
- They seem to have removed a lot of the expolarable buildings and easter eggs
- Movement can feel a bit laggy
- Can no longer kick the balls
- Co-op settings are limited and can be a bit weird
- When playing co-op it will not save your quests unless you are the host (but you will keep levels/items) which means same person must host always
- In Co-op it sometimes railroads you into doing the main quest and won't let you track the side quests
- While pretty the island no longer has that grungy feel it used to

Look overall if you already have the original don't bother unless you want to play with a friend, even then see if they can source the original.

If you played this game before Dying light, you will know how good is Dying Light now
But in the other way round...if you played Dying Light before this one...welp, maybe just wait for a huge huge sale (75% or above) 

There's a few reason that I give this a Thumbs up instead of Thumbs down,
1) You get to Boomerang your weapon as Logan ( Super Fun)
2) There's one Badass Baseball bat from one of the secret, super fun especially with Sam B

Problem here?
1) Boring attack animation

2) Certain area had crazy spawn of Zombies which kept pouring at you

3) NO Parkour :(

4) Found new Blueprint? Weapon broke? Well, look for a Crafting table then...

5) For whatever reason, My Potato Laptop can run Dying Light well....about 30~45 fps, but this game? OH BOI, 15~25fps

6) Shooting and aiming are bad that you don't even care about using guns

7) Mei's Jump attack are...Buggy? sometimes it works, and sometimes don't

8) Game is buggy at times...not sure if my luck just bad, (i.e when you came across something like a ""Safe"" you expect it to give you something worthwhile right? But NOPE, sometimes you get Nth....yeah, just imagine the SAFE is just EMPTY....

9) Arena Achievements? Well, the ""fancy"" one are bugged

10) Tons of Useless, boring fetch quest, even getting the Developer's weapon are so annoying, (eventhough the dev's weapon are fun to use

But for around Rm7.50, I get myself a Pretty ok-ish Zombie head cutting, as-S Kicking zombie game to play...but there's no Parkour system....feels YIKES

I also liked that, there's some ""more"" replay ability with different class, only if Dying Light had more interesting skill tree for specific build

Dying Light and Days Gone are far better games in just about every way. But if you have already played those games and really like a little mindless zombie bashing, this game is not bad. It just isn't great. 

As you would expect from an average game, this game has a lot of good points and bad points. Since I am giving this a thumbs up, let's start with the good stuff. There is plenty of loot. The game map is fairly large. Eventually you can drive vehicles over the walking dead. Driving over the walking dead. Fun. The game has a crafting system as well as a perk tree so you can build weapons and characters as you see fit. And your kills earn you points towards challenges. I am not sure what you get when you complete a challenge, but they are there nonetheless. 

The negative are as plentiful as the zombies. Unless you really enjoy combing beaches or ransacking vacation cabins, the game world is boring. Some of the game mechanics leave a lot to be desired. Melee weapons are plentiful, but break after less than a dozen uses. Saves are via a checkpoint system. So if you have to leave your game to go play adult games with your little woman, expect to lose a dozen minutes or more. Spending time with the game's living characters is as fun as hanging out at the local bus depot. None offer you help. Most want to turn you into their gopher. And the quests...go fetch this. Go fetch that. Kill zombies over here. Kill zombies over there. 

Still, I found my time with the game mostly enjoyable. In a mindless kind of way. The game isn't really too hard so it can be a calming experience after a day dealing with the mindless idiots of the real world.",1641328319,1641329541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(include all the sidequest)
welp do i recommend this game 
uh yes but only with friend 
playing the game alone is boring because the repeated boring quest in the game
the gameplay and the pacing : i would say is not bad beside the annoying thing when you throw your weapon and you have to find where the weapon was for like 10 min straight but thanks god the game have boomerang skill which is kinda useful if you are too lazy to find your weapon back and yet each character has different kind of skill but since people dont like essay review i decide to tell you to play it yourself and learn them instead 
music:i would tell is not bad the opening menu theme is kinda dope tho the entire soundtrack feel with atmosphere that you feel like you are alone and feel hopeless on the zombie apocalypse island
story: welp is probably the most worst thing about the game the story is kinda linear and the dev really try to let the most of the side character interesting for example jin dad basically just appear for like few quest 
and then die afterward for like after you come back to the island third time after you complete the main jungle quest and my god the cutscene they are so bad that the dev try to make the scene so epic
for example jin went back her dad workshop cus the boat need to upgrade to avoid the tripmine on the prison
and kill her dad on his workshop and shoot the  photo with her face on it  for no fucking reason i dont know why they do this cus they want to make it emotional but atleast pls make the character has emotional like 
lay on her dead body and say something how much she love her dad but not the scene make it look badass
you try to make the side character zero character devlopment lol 
bug:i would say the game has serious performance issue and i hate it even i set the lowest setting i still have 
like 11-21 fps on the game lol
overall the game has potential and the game trailer is amazing and emotional guess what it have nothing to do on this game just a two dead corpse lying on the ground and grab hand together
anyway i give this a 7/10 absolutely worth the time with friend",1641060735,1641060735,True,1,0,0.466335207223892212,0,True,False,False

There is a wide variety of weapons available as the game progresses.  I have completed this game once, other tries 1/2 to 3/4 completed.  Each try was different as to difficulty.  The end of the game is very hard, or at least I thought until the last game played, going all over a town turning on speakers, the zombies kept coming, they would not stop, can not tell you how many times I died.  Be aware of the guys in straight jackets, it takes bombs to kill him, and he does not like to stand still, also there can be three, one after the other.  If you want a good, long, and frustrating game, this is it.  
The biggest drawback, besides dying allot, is the uncalled for language.  I am an ex-marine and the most I have ever cussed was playing this game.  Good luck.
12-20-21  There are problems and glitches in this game, but the game came out in 2016 so fixes will not be coming.  It is to bad the gamer can not save when they want to, this would help when there is a glitch.  When there is a glitch and you load last check point, the glitch is still there. If you load a particular act, the gamer looses the advancements, resulting in starting the game from scratch.  Two of the glitches are; some times gas cans and juice boxes can not be placed in the high lighted spaces. Some times items can not be picked up such as I.D. cards.  
This is a complicated game to make and would be my favorite game if it were not for the comments above.

Driving is horrendous. When you first start the car and hold left or right, often it just goes straight. So you have to go forward (or backwards which means you turn the engine on) a little bit until you can turn. This can be annoying in certain scenarios. Also the terrain/maps have so many weird spots that can get you stuck. This may not be the case in he first act, but later on you can notice it a lot. For example in the second act in town (with the church), when you finally get the base with the car, it's literally trapped inside that base. A bunch of containers and other stuff blocks you from leaving and even if you do manage to leave somehow, the entire city has a bunch of crap on the streets which makes it pointless to go by car. Might as well just fast travel.

Combat is clunky. Sometimes you hit the zombies dead on and it doesn't register. On top of that the modifications are kinda pathetic. You would think after you modify your machete with fire, each and every zombie you hit will burn but that is not the case. It's pretty much random and doesn't happen a lot at all. Also throwing weapons can sometimes just make them disappear or get stuck in some wall.

Copy and pasted missions that waste your time. For example in the first act there is a guy who can make molotovs, but you need to bring him 5 alcohol bottles. You only get one molotov and shortly later on you meet another guy who makes them for three bottles of alcohol. Then you have the dude who needs food and barely gives you any exp or money. These kind of mission are never-ending and a total waste of time.

Guns feel extremly weak against higher level zombies. Even the regular ones need a bunch of bullets, but the big guys usually only take 1dmg. Even when modified you need to be lucky to set them on fire or shock them. I have to waste my entire bullet stash to kill one of those fat spitters with an assault rifle. Headshots sometimes do more damage, but it also seems random. 


Well, enough ranting. I'm sure there is more stuff I'll notice that bothers me, but overall I can recommend this game if it's on sale. It's still a lot of fun and if you just want to smash some zombies, it's pretty decent.",1639425994,1639426063,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I hate in any game is animation p*rn i.e. animations that are overly realistic and/or too long for no reason and hinder the gameplay. In Dead Island there is a ton of them e.g. getting up after being knocked down, healing (this one actually got me killed several times), throwing (Molotovs and grenades), climbing ladders, picking up weapons, eating food, leaving and entering cars. Mind you, in Definitive Edition this has been toned down, but the stuff that remains is still annoying. There are also other quirks like climbing up steeper stairs also takes really long, your character has a short start up before running at full speed etc., but these are more physics based.
Other small nuisances include sometimes not being able to turn 1-2 seconds after starting the car or using the quick heal button which uses up Large Medkits first, before the Medium ones, completely backwards to what is the standard in other games.
Throw damage is insane on both the player's, and enemies', sides. So much so that generic Walkers with butter knives are infinitely more dangerous than boss enemies like Thugs, Butchers, or Rams, since none of these can literally ONE SHOT you from range. On any character, even Sam B, who is the tankiest of them all.

The game is surprisingly serious and includes stuff like implied r*pe, however it juxtaposes it with silly gameplay mechanics with challenge names like Ya Really referencing an age old meme or Sam B's character in its entirety. They do not mesh that well. No wonder Techland went with the fully serious approach in Dying Light. The only other way it could have gotten, is Dead Rising levels of humor.

What I do like:
The fact that headshotting humans even with the most crappy guns kills them instantly, unless they are boss characters.
Easiest collectible achievement and challenge I think I have ever done in a game with so many of them i.e. well over 100.
What I do love in the Definitive Edition, are the near instant loading screens, even between maps. The original had very long load times, even on good hardware, so this is a huge improvement.

Most importantly, the game is just a lot of fun, despite all of the mentioned jank, and is well worth the money.",1639300563,1639300563,True,11,2,0.599545836448669434,0,True,False,False

There is this idea that Dead Island is Dying Light with a less complex system of combat and none of the platforming mechanics but I found it more like a Skyrim mod with zombies and a more modern setting. Just like I've always disliked archery and horse back riding in Skyrim because of its clunkiness I am equally dissatisfied with Dead Island's terrible gun battles and car driving mechanics which don't allow a third person view. If you've ever played Skyrim the combat is very similar with a few design departures to keep things fresh; the awesome weapon throwing mechanic and the fact that it normally takes one hit to kill an enemy and only takes a couple for an enemy to kill you. This makes combat both desperate and quick with a high emphasis on avoiding fights where possible, healing often, and generally being very careful when moving through the game world. Combat is no nonsense in Dead Island with each mistake being punished severely and I love this combat system it made me want to play more despite the incredible repetition of fighting through endless respawning enemies on the map. This games worst fault is platforming. Platforming in Dead Island is a thankless chore and while I don't think Dead Island should necessarily be compared to Dying Light I can't help but make that comparison when it comes to platforming because Dying Light's platforming is also first person but also a million times better. Another complaint would be that despite Dead Island being a horror game it doesn't feel like one nor does it act like one. It's closer to an action movie that is about a zombie apocalypse, don't go into this game expecting to get scared. Invisible walls really bother me in open world games especially ones that come out of nowhere with no explanation or a platform that looks like it can be jumped on but some invisible force stops you just before you can land and pushes you off. There are a ton of these invisible barriers in dead Island and it turns your open world gaming experience into an open world except whenever the game decides it isn't sort of experience. Despite my gripes and complaints I beat the game, thoroughly enjoyed it, and I bought it on sale for less than 10 dollars.

This makes a fight with even one or two zombies your level actually a threat. In melee, at least...
And the fact that you can't just take off to the rooftops and freerun your way across the entire map helps too.

This is a warning I'm wishing I saw before I bought this edition of the game. I'm a first person Veteran. I have never gotten sick playing Half-Life, Apex Legends, or even VR Games. I've played countless games that have been known to cause motion sickness, but none of them have been on the level of this game.

It can't be me right? I've never had motion sickness before? That's how I felt, so I went scouring over on the internet and found old forum posts and threads of people getting motion sickness. It was usually either VR players, but then you would see Dead Island listed as one of the games that would cause people to throw up.

I tried a bunch of fixes from people screaming at me, telling me it's my fault, or that I didn't soldier on. I turned off Motion Blur, I turned off Chromatic Abberation, and I even widened the FOV as much as I could without breaking the game.T urns out there's an insane amount of Head Bobbing included with the game. Walking? Camera sway. Running? Camera bounce. Swinging your weapon? Camera jumps.

The camera motion cannot be modded out at this moment unfortunately. So as of this post, there's still no way to remove this head motion. On top of this I believe there are other issues with the way the game is rendered that adds to the jarring feeling, There's frame pacing issues, random stutters, and there's even input delay if you're using a mouse and keyboard. These are problems I've seen cause motion sickness in VR.

The Original Dead Island was a fun bit of mess I played back in the day, but it was removed from the store front to force people to buy this ""Definitive Edition"". I bought it to mess around with some friends just for the nostalgia, but I threw up today and powered through just to get my money's worth. Now if you have no attachments to this game, I wouldn't recommend that you touch it with a ten foot pole. There are bugs in here that weren't present in the original game. (Invisible walls, collisions with AI waypoints that you run into as a player for some reason, random deaths, untriggerable quest points???) But if you feel like these are things you can get over, the game is still the same fun mess it was, and the quests will give you a lot to do. Just don't play this game ""for the story"" because the story is a big fat mess as well.",1637399517,1637399517,False,0,0,0.469798654317855835,0,True,False,False

Dead island -  a lovely island paradise gone very, very wrong. You pick one of four characters to play as:

Sam B - The ""tanky"", lots of health blunt weapon expert who's job it is to keep surviving hits for the team and to make clearings open with his rage ability that knocks down zombies. Sam B focus on crowd control with his abilities.

Xian Mei - The ""assassin"" who focuses on bladed weapons and has a lot of stamina to keep attacking. Her fury ability attacks enemies with a short knife in a blinding frenzy of stabs and slashes. Her damage offset is that she has the lowest health of all the characters and can thus die easily if not careful.

Logan Carter - The ""Jack of all trades"" class who likes to fight with throwing weapons. His fury is unlimited throw weapons for a shot duration. His skills focus on damage, survival and throwing weapon retrieval. Just be careful as you can loose an extremely powerful weapon by throwing it at the enemy only for it to disappear. 

Purna Jackson - The ""support"" class who focuses on firearms. Her rage ability is a gun with unlimited ammo for a short duration. As it says on the tin, just focus on her firearm abilities and peel off zombies that pin down allies in tricky situations. Only negative she is has is firearms are rare and ammo even more so.

The overall story is broken down into 4 acts (a total of 16 chapters) with new game + once you complete it. The level cap is level 50. The gameplay is solid, you hack, slash and shoot zombies in a first person perspective. You complete quests for people who reward you with loot and better weapons. Your weapons can break so keep them in good conditions or els you might run into problems. You can craft special weapons with unique properties such as lightning damage that can shock zombies (and yourself if your not careful) or bleeding damage. Lots of unique crafts to look out for. The setting is good as all four acts have a unique location. Only the last act for me felt a bit rushed as many of the content just feels like timesink fillers at the end. The overall story is fun enough, but when it comes to killing zombies, people don't care too much.

There are still some bugs persisting today as the game doesn't receive any new updates but you should still be able to complete the game. Multiplayer is non exisiting as people went over to Dying Light. If you can get the game to work with a friend, its lots of fun for many hours. You can also look out for some collectables if you choose to do so. Graphical update and a much smoother gameplay experience is also in the updated version.

What I loved about this game on the outset was the open world feel and the exploration. At one point, I was in a hotel waking up to an outbreak that happened overnight, the next I was on the beach slaughtering zombies and doing errands. However, the maps are diverse with a city, sewers and jungle to explore as well. The music in the game is fantastic and sets up the tone for the game. The gameplay is where it is at though! You can master many types of combat from melee to pistols and other weapons. On top of this you can modify your weapons to get more gruesome and epic kills in. The modding of weapons is diverse enough where eventually you will find a weapon you like and works for you which is amazing. 

Dead Island can also get repetitive as well at times. With familiar fetch quests and smashing the same button to kill zombies. For this reason, you can burn out easily. Luckily the main quest is not too long. 

Overall, Dead Island is a game you will either love or hate. For me I loved it and am excited to look into other Techland's projects.",1634673982,1634674077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

overall the game looks a lot less muddy than the Xbox and runs better. (the performance is dependent on what specs you have in your computer and the in game settings you have set)

i have all the settings cranked up as high as they will go, and set to my monitor's native resolution of 1920x1080 at 144hz.

the framerate maintains a steady 170 fps average with dips down to 154fps during certain situations.

there are still some problems in this version. but these were also in the Xbox 360 version as well.
these issues are as follows:

*abrupt pits that cannot be jumped out of or are difficult to get out of.

*throwing weapons near certain geometry and places causes them to go thru parts of the map.

*the auto save system is very Flawed/Broken and needs work. it often forgets to remember certain things i have completed.
---
the keyboard and mouse controls are nice to have especially when it comes to the gun play, and keeping compatibility with controllers is also very nice. i switch between both of them and i enjoy playing either way.

the vehicles are decently fun to drive but they get caught on a lot of geometry without explanation, things that look like a vehicle can clear it, are seemingly arbitrarily limited as to where you can drive your vehicle, the driving can come to a complete stop if you hit a railing on a long drive. or even slightly bump into it with the side of your vehicle. making 
traveling across the areas a lot more time consuming.

the missions feel just fine and are sometimes pretty fun, some are not so great but a good chunk of the missions are great to go thru.

there are some objectives that are always active, like fetch quests for specific items, these will give you money and xp and eventually level you up.

the upgrade system is very fun to mess around with and makes the games difficulty more easy to deal with as the zombie crowds get larger.

the voice lines for certain characters are shared across multiple npc's and can get very old. it allows you to skip voice lines. this also speeds up those continuing fetch quests.

i recommend this game for the mechanics of the game and also the awesome atmosphere. and because i just plain enjoy this game, i have yet to play dead island riptide because i wanna beat the first game before i move on.

Dead Island, no matter if Definitive Edition or not, is a complete mess of a game. 

It starts out okay enough: The beginning chapters in the island resort is a good way to introduce the mechanics, fight zombies, do a few quests and have some fun.
That completely goes down the drain in Act 2, one of the most boringly designed city levels I've ever seen in a zombie game. Furthermore, this Act suddenly ramps up the difficulty to a degree that it starts to annoy. And sadly, it never recovers from that part. In the final chapter I began running past groups of zombies because I only wanted it to end. Couldn't be bothered to fight any of them. 
Started to question how the mechanics work. The stamina system, regardless on how many point you invested into it, seems to work on its own set of rules. There is a crafting system, but you need so many ingredients, that it often becomes pointless. Also: Who came up with the idea to let your own status effects hurt you as well? 

Frequently I encountered zombies stuck in the environment, got crushed by a gas cylinder when I tried to throw it, got stuck myself. Bugs are plentiful.
Nobody is memorable in any way. Even the guy who is supposed to be the villain comes off as just another dude. Same goes for the story. Nothing interesting here.

Gonna need a loooooong break before I even consider starting Dead Island Riptide. This was a pain. No wonder I eventually just stopped playing when it first came out back in the day.

I have hundreds of hours played between the vanilla version on PC and PS3.

This is still in my top 5 Zombie games of all time. 

This is a solid Borderlands style Loot Shooter / Hack and Slasher.

You have shambler style undead (George A Romero) as well as running infected (28 Days / Dawn 2004).

I still enjoy this more than Dying Light and I hope someday we still get the promised sequel.

I would describe the gameplay as a crossover of Left 4 Dead and Borderlands, because like L4D it's first-person, with you (or a team) fighting against numerous hordes of zombies. And like Borderlands, you choose one of the 4 characters, it's open-world, has vehicles, fast travel only from certain locations, and you lose money when you die, but not progress. And for the survival elements, you would have to constantly repair your melee weapons with money because they take damage after being used.

You will play as one of the zombie-immune survivors, as they try to help themselves and their friends from escaping the zombie-infested tourist spot Banoi Island, a fictional island located near Papua Nugini. Each character chosen will have slightly different abilities, but not really that distinct. You cannot change characters in one playthrough. The sad thing is that your chosen character will always be alone, but in the cutscenes the other 3 are always present. Would be cooler if they appear as AIs if you play without friends.

Story-wise, the game is... not so good. It's very generic, and for some reason I just cannot feel attachment or care about the characters, and the fact that many of them lack character depth and look similar doesn't help. Most quests are also just simple fetch quests, go here, get this item or kill this enemy, go back. Since fast travel is only available from very few areas and many places don't allow vehicle access, you'll end up running back and forth in many places while being chased by zombies.

This version contains the Ryder White's Campaign and Bloodbath Arena. Ryder White's story acts as a prequel and is started by choosing him in the character selection menu. You play as Australian soldier Ryder White, following his orders and trying to save his wife. Unlike the main game, his campaign is linear. However, there will be a lot more zombies, which would be very time and resource consuming to kill, so the best strategy is to run away when you can, and close the doors because they can't open doors. This DLC contains some spoilers for the final act, so keep that in mind if you wanna play this one first.

As for the Bloodbath Arena DLC, it is accessed from the fast travel map and is available from the start. You will be in a military bunker, and have access to 4 survival arenas. There is no extra story content here besides you meeting another group of survivors taking residence there. But it is recommended to start playing here after finishing the story once and starting New Game+, since you will be at a high enough level and have decent equipment to help tackle the enemies.

However, this game has a major issue with poor optimization. I have enough specs to run this game at high settings smoothly, but for some reason it performs very poorly and lags a lot, only getting 15-20 fps even after I lowered the graphics and resolution. The only way to get a decent framerate is by constantly plugging and unplugging my laptop charger, a fact I sadly learned when I'm nearing the end.

I would honestly give this game a mixed review, because despite the generic story, forgettable characters, repetitive quests, and very poor optimization, I still had some fun, and the first area, the Resort, is unique for me because I never seen any zombie story set in a beautiful beach resort in broad daylight. If you like L4D, Borderlands, or Dying Light you might enjoy Dead Island, but beware of the numerous issues this game has.",1630251250,1630251250,True,2,1,0.532554268836975098,0,True,False,False

If you're looking for a zombie slasher/shoot em up this is the one for you. This game was ages ahead of it's time and Techland knew that. For me, I grew up (teenage years) playing this with a close friend from high school. Most of the school days after school were spent playing Dead Island on the 360 on coop. HOWEVER, solo is just as fun and worth it too.

PROS:
Custom weapons can be created with craft-able parts you find in the massive open world
The story line or campaign is timeless and a classic (no replay-ability however)
The combat system has been vastly improved

CONS:
Sometimes, you will spawn in with very low FPS so don't exitsave near a horde or a Ram, etc
The voice acting is still a bit cringy at times
The combat system with the specials isn't great but definitely still playable.

Overall, seeing this game gain some steam (no pun intended) especially in the shadow of the long awaited Dying Light sequel does my heart good. This game is a solid addition to your zombie game collection if you're an avid zombie fan like me. Definitely worth a buy. 9.5/10",1629863970,1629863970,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat loop is melee and guns, which is complemented by the skills you can unlock to gain certain finishers and generally improve your deadliness. Weapons, excluding guns, have a durability meter(which tbh is more annoying than anything), (now including guns) can be upgraded four times, and modified to have special affects(such as bleed, fire, lighting, etc). There are a multitude of minor bugs that rarely harm the experience, usually they are just funny to look at and then you can go on your way. (you can look at my recent screenshots for examples). Hit boxes in this game are either normal or terrible, both when interacting with items or prompts and you taking damage. As in sometimes I couldn't pick of items or put them in specific locations for a quest and when fighting zombies they will sometimes land throw or grab attacks even when they clearly missed. Additionally, the damage received from throw attacks do an insane amount of damage, which is cheap in the sense that the zombies that can throw their weapon do it before you can realize they have a weapon, they can do it off screen, they can hit you with a throw even with their back turned to you, and lastly even at level 50 I was still getting one shoted by their attacks.

If you're looking for a co-op game, with zombies that is fun enough to lose a few hours in with your mates then you could do worse than Dead Island.

The graphics are dated by this point, but there are a couple of nice effects and there is enough variety in the environments to keep your interest. The large variety of weapons also helps to keeps things fresh; however, it is a shame that the weapon handling is sluggish and the less said about the gun combat the better as it often feels like an after-thought by the developers. There are a few different zombies that you will encounter throughout the game, but nothing too surprising or horrifying compared to other zombie games that are out there.

The storyline in the game is cliched and, for someone who loves well-written RPGs, is completely forgettable. The quests too can swing from fairly interesting to bland-go-there-fetch-this-bring-it-back-here quests.

Coming to this game really late, I have to also mention the elephant in the room which is Dying Light. I wholly recommend Dying Light over Dead Island if there was a choice. Dying Light does everything better than this game and you can see Dead Island as a stepping stone towards that.

So why in the world am I recommending Dead Island? Because despite the flaws, my brother and I had a good time playing through this game Co-op. I wouldn't touch this game if it was just single-player for all the detriments I've mentioned earlier; however, with a good buddy by your side this game can be much more enjoyable.

But if there was a choice - Dying Light over Dead Island hands down :)",1628086487,1628086487,True,8,0,0.571971237659454346,0,True,False,False

This game imo has not aged very well and it becomes painfully obvious when you compare it to the spiritual successor of Dying Light (even though that game also had its issues).

Story
The story was just terrible LOL. Easily the most forgettable part of this whole game. Many of the actions the characters do are either painfully obvious, or painfully stupid. It didn't help that the mocap/animations for this game didn't age the best, so everyone seemed like they had a stick glued to the back of themselves, and did everything they could to make sure that stick never broke. The ending especially was just pretty bad, but around act I, act II, and a few moments of act III the story had many good moments. But act IV was just terrible and really ruined the story as a whole for me.

Characters
The characters for me are pretty recognizable as I used to spend hundreds of hours with them during the 360 era. However really looking into the characters and seeing them without the nostalgia goggles, they really sucked in terms of how they were presented. Many of them seemed so two dimensional, and would make poor decisions that was just so painful to sit through. Riptide def fleshed them out more, but the main cast was just way too stiff for my liking. The side characters that weren't in act I were just plain bad. They either had 0 character, or died after you left them for 10 minutes.

Gameplay
The gameplay for this game is honestly, still pretty good. However now that dying light is out which improved the game tremendously, the gameplay is just ok. I don't know if it was just me, but the zombies in this definitive edition just felt SOOO light, and I could kick them away for days without worry at all. Other aspects like no dropkick, and a meh skilltree led to the game just feeling like it was missing something that dying light filled. It's a shame cause this formula was where it all started, but newer games imo have just done it better now.

Tone
This is an extra point for this game, but the tone of this game was just all around the place. It seemed like it wanted to be taken seriously, but the poor animations, story telling and decision making just made this game a comedy instead. I know the developers changed the tone last minute cause it was supposed to be more comedy, but the dark tone just didn't work well for me and I love those types of story telling. Many of the moments in the story were too cliche for me to worth caring for.

Last notes
This game, playing it again, just showed me how painfully average it was. The endgame just seemed like it wouldn't be as fun as other games would be, and even though I have experienced maxing out my character in the 360, I just don't see myself doing it for this game. It really sucks because I held high praise for this game I used to play, and to realize just how PAINFULLY average it was, it really makes me wish I just didn't play it again.

Saving Grace
This game's coop mode is honestly pretty fun and the only reason why I would recommend this to anyone. The difficulty however is obvious that it wasn't scaled for coop, but the laughs you can get from this game makes up for the easy difficulty of this game. Death doesn't matter cause you respawn, zombies can easily be swarmed by the players and the 4 combined abilities makes this game a pretty easy cakewalk. So if you play this game solo, the difficulty is def much more fun in terms of gameplay, but the poor character, story and a bit poorly aged combat system compared to newer titles makes this really hard to recommend solo. But with coop I think it has its worth.

Conclusion
I am a bit disappointed to see just how average this game really was. Maybe it was due to my friends not caring for the story, so I was left with being rushed to do the story dialogue. However I do feel like if I TRULY invested into the story it still wouldn't be close to a memorable story as any other game I have played.

Kinda of a shame
4.5/10, may have its worth if you play in COOP, but single player just buy dying light... which also has a poor story LOL.",1627465410,1627465410,False,8,0,0.469639033079147339,0,True,False,False

The melee system is suprisingly deep, you must aim for pieces of the enemy, you have multiple damage types, you have stamina and the option to disable/stun or damage the enemy in that limited Energy. Combined with the well crafted gore system and hitting the enemy feels rewarding and damaging. It barely feels tedious to blend through fodder even.

So why is the game so bad if the core mechanic is so well crafted? Well the story's merely ok but the 2nd half of the game in level design and said story feels incredibly rushed. The Ending barely even makes sense.
The 1st area (Beach Resort) is finely crafted with level and world detail and little repetition. You spend the first 1/3rd of the game here. Pacing is fine, Enemies are fine, Story is fine, good Melee system.
But once you head into the 2nd area, the town, things start derailing. The plot starts to feel more arbitrary, the level more repetitive, and the pacing more annoying. There's one particular sewer path the main story forces you to take 3-5 times!

This only degenerates more as the game goes on, the 3rd area (Jungle) is there for barely 2 hours, and feels like parody/satire. At least the last area (Jail) is well plotted out and looks better but it's still repetitive, and the story seems non-sequitur so that I don't fully understand the ending even, which turns into a 10 minute boss arena and then game ends. So yeah, really rushed the dev cycle/release because the 1st area to the other ones feels like there were made by different devs.

The game used to be really buggy, but the devs went back and patched almost all of them, ragdoll physics were the worst thing we encountered. So that's nice at least.",1626043489,1626043489,False,0,0,0.497237592935562134,0,True,False,False

Most quests (I'd hazard a guess of around 90-95%) are single phase fetch quests (e.g. follow marker, pickup item, come back and collect reward). The only enemies you have to kill are the ones marked as red skulls on your mini-map, you can just sprint past all others as they are much slower than you. Even the majority of the ""main story"" quests are like this.

The quests have ranked difficulties (using a skull rating system), however, this doesn't seem to reflect the difficulty of the quests at all (e.g. quests at opposite ends of the scale can have the same number and type of enemies).

Health items are everywhere, every few meters you'll find snacks and drinks to heal back up to full health after every minor inconvenience.

If you do die then you'll lose a negligible amount of money and likely respawn at a further along point in the quest.

The driving in the game is terrible. The maps are too tiny to warrant cars, you only need to drive for a dozen or so seconds to each marker. The cars instantly kill all enemies and you can only be hurt once inside of car if you come to a complete stop.

The game lacks any real story, I hope you read the short character bios on the selection screen because that's all you're getting! The ""main story"" quests are mostly about grabbing some supplies for people you've been given no reason to care about.

‣ Final notes: The best part of this game is its intro, from there on out its all down hill. Dead Island is a very boring game. This feels like an alpha Walmart edition beta bullshit that eventually got made into dying light, a game I really enjoy. Everything here is broken. The game is glitchy, the movement is slow and robotic, the animations are horrible, the combat is bad, I just have nothing good to say about this shitstorm. Playing this game was only enjoyable because of the way it is broken. Laughing because of stupid animations or glitches was the only enjoyable part. The story is very bland and boring, the dialogue is poorly written and the voice acting is fucking C tier. The added bad fov makes you feel even slower then you are. To me Dead Island really lacked the movement Dying Light has or even the combat. All the side quests you do will have zero impact on you because of how boring and repetitive they are. Even when you progress the what ever the fuck main story is you will encounter recycled locations and objectives. Overall this is one of those games I just can not recommend or say anything positive about. The story and anything else is boring and poorly written. The characters fail to be interesting besides the one and only SAM B. Dated controls and graphics also make the game less bearable and the AI, UI map design, everything is just whack.

383150,94626222,76561197966597554,721,98,7,0,7,1624934650,"A fairly average ""looter-shooter"" styled game that can be a decent amount of fun with at least one other friend in CO-OP.

The combat system was neither bad nor exceptionally good, just at the right level of ""average"" that is still satisfying. Most of the combat in this game will be done up close with melee weapons. Enemies can be dismembered in various ways and bones can crack/break aswell. While there are guns in the game they usually don't do enough damage to justify using terribly often. Although I must mention there is a single player DLC character that has his own campaign (recommended to play after one non-dlc play-through) where the game balance is closer to an FPS style at which point firearms are fantastic there at any case. 

Dead Island has some of the standard RPG style mechanics, like leveling up and choosing skills, upgrading weapons and customizing them with a choice of a single elemental type from a pool of 3. Most skills are extremely basic ""more inventory space"" ""more damage for a specific weapon type"". Some enable a couple of new game mechanics, like one character can knock over enemies when he runs into them and each character has their own unique ""Fury"" mode that they can enable if they have recharged their fury-meter.

There is a standard set of 4 characters, each with their own skill-tree (with some crossovers) and some sort of combat-specialization. I don't think they actually play very differently from each other though, so ultimately each play-through the game experience doesn't change much at all. Unless you're a completionist I'd suggest just sticking with one character and enjoying a single play-through.

There is a level scaling system where the enemies and their possible loot will scale to match your player level. This typically means you won't feel insanely overpowered most of the time, although there are some very strong weapon upgrades that can result in some fun one-shotting times.

The story did not blow me away. There were a few scenes that were clearly made to be either ""artistic"" or ""emotional"" but they were merely ""blah"" instead. Plenty of fetch-quests, which can mostly be done along side others in a group so weren't too terrible. I don't know where to put this, but my favourite quote by far is during one of the escort missions where the NPC keeps repeating the same lines ""We need to get going"" with a really naggy kind of accent.

I thought the environments of game were reasonably good. I certainly enjoy the starter area, with the big beach featuring fairly bright lighting and of course sand-castles made of rock solid stone that can't be trampled on. There's also a sewers level which I think is a fan favourite. The dull and bleak corridors of concrete and pipes makes for a good time.

There is an older version of Dead-Island which is no longer sold and that has no upgrade-path to this new version. This separates the limited player-base and can make it awkward to play with friends that might have have the old version or the new version. While the game itself was a fun enough ride I don't actually recommend buying this title for any price due to this fact alone.",1624934700,1624934700,False,1,0,0.4797687828540802,0,True,False,False

The first act while not perfect at least has much more charm and inspiration than the three other acts that follow. The beach side section of the game that was advertised so heavily quickly gives way to another generic city section with enough sewer portions to make any zombie video game player sick to their stomach. Which is then followed by an uninspired jungle sequence which ends with a prison finale that can be rushed through in record breaking speeds without much effort. 

Combat is somewhat enjoyable at first but that gives way to multiple enemy types that rely on knockdown and insta-kill mechanics to one up the player no matter their adjustment to the sluggish way of fighting. Not to mention the amount of times players will have to fight all of these variants at once in cqc environments. Natural flow does not exist once the running infected types are introduced, and it only gets much worse from there. 

The story itself is quite forgettable, not that it needed to be legendary but since so much attention is given to completing it there leaves much to be desired. Characters are no different, the main crew is serviceable and not exactly altruistic but they do not grate on the nerves. Side characters on the other hand range from forgettable to downright obnoxious in their actions and motivations. Much more so when at times you have to escort them from point a to b while they are hounded by the hordes of the undead all the while. 

And don't forget all the bugs, glitches, and lack of time spent on the actual character models that leaves them laughable for all the wrong reasons.

Dead Island is a game way ahead of its time and playing it together with friends is a must. However, my experience with this game went downhill during 3/4 of the story where one of the main characters we had to escort kept bugging out and killing herself. I was annoyed about this as her character was so redundant to the storyline and the fact that she kept self-destructing, causing my friends and I unable to progress through the main story made it even worse. 

But to my surprise at the end of the game, the developers (GUESS WHAT??) killed off this useless character. And with that I was extremely delighted with the ending. 

I rate this game a 100/10. Highly recommended!",1623510123,1623510465,True,0,0,0.492424249649047852,0,True,False,False

The definitive edition truly didn't bring much.
It pretty much is just the exactly same game.
Sure, some visuals got an upgrade, but yeah.
This wasn't a free upgrade, It was expensive. 
I bought the collection with riptide included.
The original owners had a discount for that.
It was around 9€ in total, I don't remember.
The level of improvement is very small, tho.
You could get mods for the original games.
Those mods also improved the visual style.
But unlike this, they were free to download.
Was this definitive upgrade worth it? Nope.
I just do not think it was a worthy upgrade.
It feels more like a cash-grab to be honest.
Nowadays you can't buy the originals, tho.
Therefore: It's great for all the new players.
Paying for the same games twice isn't fun.
Especially if there isn't anything truly new.
It is like paying for some cool visual mods.

383150,93091761,76561198366578924,0,6,2731,0,1520,1652926433,"I played the original version of this game when it came out in 2011. I ran it back then on my old Intel Q6600 system with 4gb of DDR2 and an HD4870. It ran great in 1680x1050. The game had a few bugs, but was overall very fun. The platforming was a bit funky but reliable once you learned it, and the guns sucked, until you got to the very end, where they still sucked, just slightly worse. I played it through twice and then set it down. I would definitely recommend that version of the game.

Nowadays i'm playing on a 5600x, 1660 Super, 16 gigs of DDR4, and a 4k monitor. I bought the game for a lark and decided to replay through it. That was about when i noticed that they had redone the original game in a new engine. The new engine is objectively worse in almost every way than the old one. While they did patch out a few funny exploits (such as the ability to break bones multiple times using broken brass knuckles) they made just about every other aspect of the game worse.

From a performance perspective, the game runs terribly. Even with all effects off and all settings at low, I still encounter stuttering and framedrops in 1440p, even while running at a solid 90-120fps at all time. Vsync doesn't resolve the issue, and 4k becomes unplayable because despite maintaining a solid 60-75fps, the framedrops are even worse. The animation of the jump kick just becomes a slide show. Whatever is going on with the ""improved"" engine, it's optimization is hot garbage. On top of that, there are a host of bugs and collision issues that often result in your character dying at random. When running into an object such as a beachball, or a door. Your thrown blunt weapons sometimes randomly disappear through floors/walls; Enemy thrown objects do massively increased damage compared to the original. (often enough to one hit the player if not at full health) and the head/limb targeting has been completely broken. Even the gunplay is worse, as if that was possible!

As far as gameplay, i really do enjoy the core gameplay loop, best described as a ""Zombie Looter Shooter"". You open chests and kill bosses to get tiered loot, it's a very common idea that was a lot more groundbreaking in 2011. The execution is lackluster, and that's not new to the remake. The first act really is by far the best part of the game. It is very dense with collectables and little side quests that reward exploration and make it fun for the player. The zombies can be a challenge at times, but they never feel unfair. As soon as you begin the second act, the game completely throws the design principles of the first act out of the window, as well as attempts to change the story from the original light hearted camp fest, to something much more dark. As well, exploration becomes both less rewarding and much more challenging. On top of that, there are some very, VERY bad platforming sequences that had me absolutely pulling my hair out.

At the end of the day this is a classic game that like so many before it was butchered by a bad port. If only the ""remaster"" had only improved upon the original, this could have been such a better experience.",1622704856,1622704856,False,3,0,0.485327929258346558,0,True,False,False

Then the game forces you to do more side quests while the main story is getting prepared? I just don't want to run through an entire town putting up posts on a billboard for a random dude or run around finding champagne for some chick.

The combat and the fact that I (initially) wanted to finish the game, is the only reason I was able to see it through to the end. Tons of obnoxious bullsh*t that just ruins the pace/flow of the game and many weird game ""features"" that completely ruins the experience.

The first main trailer for Dead Island made it seem like it was going to be some interesting story-driven game. Me and my friends were anticipating the day of getting our hands on this. Release day comes, get the game... a buggy piece of trash.

TL;DR This is one of the most repetitive, buggiest & disappointing games I have ever played to date. Avoid the headaches and frustration and play something far superior like Borderlands.

[b][u]STORY[/u][/b]
Dead Island offers barely any story. You play 1 of 4 forgettable characters that are immune to the virus that are trying to work their way off of the island of Banoi. You will visit 4 different settings throughout gameplay, but everything after the beach isn't worth visiting. Most environments are horribly designed and severely disappointing in comparison to the starting area.

Aside from the story missions there are side missions. These side missions are pointless fetch quests, don't waste your time unless you need to experience gain (as if that is really going to help).

[b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b]
The gameplay for Dead Island is buggy, annoying, and so stale that the 4-year-old piece of popcorn under your couch tastes fresher in comparison. Sure, beating the shit out of zombies is fun and all at first, but once you get through the first handful of quests you will realize that there is nothing better coming along. Quests are ridiculously boring because you are fetching something 98% of the time.

You are going to quickly realize how horribly executed every mechanic in this game is. Fast stamina depletion extend playtime WAY too much. Driving is fun at first as you get to ram zombies to the ground, but then you will start to see that you will ram every invisible wall and horribly placed obstacle in your path. Weapons purposely break after 20-30 swings. Don't be surprised that you are constantly backtracking to a safehouse to fix your weapons. Repairing your busted up weapons requires [b][i]money[/i][/b] instead of resources. You will lose all of your money you just earned from missions and exploration.

The weapon mods are as follows: Shock, Acid, Fire & Bleeding damage. You get more powerful variations of each as you progress, but then the old weapon mods become pointless as you go.  Skill tree design is actual trash and barely helpful for your character. Also, don't get me started on the gunplay. All I will say is the guns in this game are pellet guns with inferior ammo reserves (I think your max ammo capacity is 3-clips worth - THATS IT).

The zombies can be so frustrating. Normal zombies chucking weapons like boat paddles at you is probably the most infuriating thing in the game. The damage stats on the weapons they throw are extremely low, yet they knock you down and take 75% of your health in one hit. ""Thugs"" and ""Tanks"" knock you down and deplete your health drastically with every hit. You will find yourself avoiding them when you can rather than taking them down.

Please note that collectibles are a waste of time and provide nothing as a reward, don't waste your time even as a completionist. Do not bother trying to get 100% on this horrendous game.

[b][u]SOUND[/u][/b]
The ambient music is decent but bland. The best track in the game is Sam B's ""Who Do You Voodoo?"" from the intro. Zombie sounds get repetitive fast. Voice acting is horrendous aside from Sam B and Sinamoi. I'm surprised Phil LaMarr (Sam B) touched this project with a 10-foot pole. The voice actress for Xian Mei is purposely stereotyping herself, providing some of the worst lines in the game.

[b][u]GRAPHICS/VISUALS[/u][/b]
Presentation improved with Definitive Edition, but the character models are still choppy polygons. Starting beach area looks great. The other areas look horrendous. The jungle area is absolutely terrible to navigate through, and it is a big portion of the game.

[b][u]OVERALL[/u][/b]
It's a waste. Not worth more than playing past the first act but not solo. The only redeeming quality is playing with friends online and doing stupid things together while making fun of the game.

i  can see why people like/liked this game but there is just so much wrong with it. 
The combat is tedious and not very precise. Driving is just god awful and should have been cut from the game.
The missions vary from generic to straight up brain dead. One of the main missions is to drive to the gas station and get capri sun (juice boxes) for everyone like .... that's what the group uses their immune person for ????? 
But the biggest problem is that the game cant decide which tone it wants. 1 second you see a person crying for forgiveness for killing their infected family the next second it is get champagne for the Russian bitch. It flip flops between slapstick and dramatic and obviously nether works in combination with the other. And the writing is horrible u meet a person for 20 seconds and supposed to feel bad for them when they tell you they are infected. I don't know you I don't care.
But the game has some good parts as well the limb system was revolutionary for its time and seeing a walker snap at you because you broke both its arms with a wrench is really good interaction design. The holiday tropical island is a nice setting and justifies the abundance of loot.
In conclusion it aged not very well but if you want to see where dying light came from like me its worth the play through just buy it for a few bucks on sale its not worth any more compared to other titles.",1620918883,1620918883,False,0,0,0.416096270084381104,0,True,False,False

Dead Island Definitive Edition definitely steps the game up graphic wise and looks like it fixes a few small bugs. That's pretty much it however as the story and game mechanics are still all the same. While playing this game I ran into a ton of bugs and felt like I was playing Bug Hunt: The Game. Some of these bugs included floating zombie parts, Infected that have the brain of chickens as they'd run into a wall while trying to get to me and get stuck, or zombies clipping through walls (Mainly infected). The game itself felt very static as you knew where pretty much everything was going to spawn if you went back to an area. That is one thing they should add is more of an RNG based factor for spawns for both items and zombies. I've played through the main campaign twice and after playing through it once with the blunt weapons expert and sharp weapons expert I can tell you the zombies and items will always be in there respective positions. Even once they respawn they go back to their positions. 

About the characters the game has decent replayability due to having four different characters with different skill trees and fun weapon areas to specialize in. Character development wise? God no. There's nothing much there except in the cutscenes. The cutscenes were pretty much the only area that showed character development at all. The story was pretty decent and was a standard zombie story on a tropical paradise which I felt was intriguing. The character models, voice acting and character expressions could either be good or terrible. I felt like I began to see a repeat in the same character model over and over again. The character models made VERY LITTLE TO NO EXPRESSION at all. I felt like I was staring constantly into a dolls face as they'd always keep the same expression no matter if they were injured, dead, or crying and happy. Some of the voice acting can be good as in the case of Ryder White or Sinamoi and the main characters. The side characters have pretty meh to terrible voice acting though and it felt laughable sometimes. This game is pretty much dead for the online factor so if you want to get some achievements or play with others I recommend getting a group of friends or find a community online. I felt like the camera movements and controls could be a little wonky and sometimes bugged. The thing I'm probably the most disappointed in was the death mechanic. All that happens when you die is that you lose some money and respawn to the last checkpoint. I never really had a money problem due to all the side quests and the amount of money I was given doing the main quests. It felt like the death mechanic was built for CO-OP play and I was stuck in a timer for 10 seconds to wait to respawn. Once that fear of death leaves you however that really diminished the horror of the game for me, mostly knowing that I could just respawn myself at the next checkpoint. 

The reason why I've rated this game positively however is due to the nostalgia factor it gives off when playing it. It reminds me a lot of Left 4 Dead franchise with all the different zombie types. I also still did get scared sometimes by the zombies that would appear silently around a corner as I was sprinting down it. I'd jump at that because I was startled and scream. That's pretty much it for the scare factor though. The atmosphere was FANTASTIC! I really felt like I was traversing through a zombie infested tropical paradise in the aftermath in the infection and the scenery was just a beautiful pair to the dark atmosphere. The story, sometimes cheesy, can at some times be a little emotional at least for me. All in all, I think this game was a nostalgic trip for me and I'd suggest playing with some friends or others. Fun game overall and I'd also recommend getting it on sale since it seems to go on sale all the time. I'd rate it a 7/10 and a fun experience.

P.S: I highly recommend playing the Ryder White Campaign as it expands a lot more upon what was happening behind the scenes. Challenging but fun as well.",1620707810,1620708071,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Better graphics and you can always deactivate ambient occlusion and motion blur, I personally don't like that kind of think but I was coming to that subject, I'm more of an old school gamer, I prefer old games, I also prefer old school and retro graphics, Yeah, I love 8bit, 16bit, retro looking games, I love how Doom or even how The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall look like, of course, there are a few exceptions, some just hurt the eyes and some games are better to be played with better graphics, games such as Civilization even though I must admit that Civilization II was one of a beautiful game for its time.
So now that's where I was coming to, graphics aren't important to me and it shouldn't be to people, maybe, perhaps a little but not much more than the gameplay.
I personally would have prefer a new and better loot system with more sort of weapons something like Dying Light has but even better, more weapons, more guns, better gameplay, I never liked to use the guns in Dead Island, I prefer when it's realistic than arcade but in thise case, It's just too arcadish, It's even worse but that's my opinion, it would have been great if they could have made it better, perhaps not realistic since this is not a simulation game but they could have enhance it.
I won't complain though, It only cost me 10$ for both the new definitive edition plus the retro game.
But it would have seriously been awesome if there would have been more to this.
So my point is, It is good, It is worth it but they could have done so much more by enhancing the gameplay too and perhaps adding a new character with its own new skills.
Other than that, the game is great as always, It is not perfect, the gameplay still feel weird to me at least but it's not the worse thing ever neither, It can be beautiful if you play with some of the settings that's of course if you do not like some things such as motion blur and/or for example if you want to change the fov.
It's still has the crappy auto aim and slow motion that Dead Island had.
Still can't deactivate those.
Physics were bad back in Dead Island right? You'll be happy to know that they're even worse in the definitive edition.
Containers doesn't respawn, at least, not right away, the one who thought it would be a good idea to implent this is one heck of a dumbass but coming from Deep Silver or even the modern gaming industry, it's nothing special, pretty common actually.
It's supposed to be a loot game.
The zombies and the items respawn even though the containers doesn't, makes sense right?
Perhaps for a bunch of brainless incompetents such as those in Deep Silver but normally, it doesn't.


So in a few words, the bundle for people who already owned dead island and dead island: Riptide was worth the 10$.
Don't expect new and better gameplay, they never say that there would be new gameplay or anything but better graphics.
at 43 CAD, It sure would be overpriced but I won't complain about that one since I have bought the bundle for just 10$, but it still is too much considering it adds nothing new, it's just an update that should have been given for free or even never made.

So I'd say go for it if you do not have the original ones.

The game itself: 7.5/10



EDIT: The game has many problems such as misplaced items, some are passing through other items, some containers that could be opened in Dead Rising cannot be opened in this one, there are mistakes with some subtitltes such as ""here me now"", the guy at the police station says ""hear me now"" but it says ""here me now"", that's a good one Deep Silver.
I have even seen Joseph (the guy that you have to protect for the quest WAY OF SALVATION) rotates his head at 360 degree 2 consecutive times.
There are many other problems, some that has not been fixed and some that are new, good job on this one Deep Silver.
Good job.
It proves how incompetent you are at making video games, I am done buying games from you, It will have to be really cheap, really good and with lot of content if you want me to buy your next games now.

Dead Island itself 7.5/10
Definitive Edition 4/10

Hopefully that you'll be competent enough to fix the problems but I really doubt it, still cannot deactivate the slow motion and auto aim plus the physics are as bad as before, they're seriously worse.


So in the end, it has a good gameplay (melee weapons), a bad gameplay (the rest), a bad story, bad characters and that's pretty much everything.",1464736776,1620540437,False,2,0,0.510132491588592529,0,True,False,False

Graphically it holds up in some places and in others it can be a little underwhelming 
Side missions can resort to ""retrieve item for npc"" or ""do job for npc"" etc

Weapons are well executed with the wear system and have a weight to them when being used against enemies
There are many ways to customise weapons to make them more powerful
Skill trees are decent enough to satisfy the player and show change in their gameplay
The use of cars is decent (and is a one hit machine when it comes to killing enemies)
Settings work and are a big enough change to make the game have a smooth flow rather than having one setting completely stale

2 things:
1. Trigger warning for those of you who are delicate flowers or young.
2. If you suffer motion sickness from low FoV - the default FoV is tiny and changing it can be done in configuration files (google it, not hard to do), but it affects other things like decreasing your firearm accuracy. There is a decent mod on Nexusmods called ""improved movement"" that modifies some variables, including the FoV. The negative impact of this mod on accuracy is not high, so you can use that as a starting point for your FoV value and then decide if you are willing to sacrifice more accuracy or lower FoV to increase it.

Onto the review.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
This game is ""definitive"" in name only. Not worth upgrading from original. Is it a good game? Eh... If you, like me, like zombie games - I can recommend it. Just know that this is a Diablo clone, not a survival game. It's nothing like the later Dying Light.

[h1]Description[/h1]
Dead Island is a first-person Diablo clone set in zombie apocalypse on a tropical island. You will start at a vacation resort infested with zombies, helping survivors find a way out off the island. Slowly you will uncover the source of the virus and possibility for a cure.

You have 4 different characters or ""classes"" with specializations: Sam B (blunt melee), Xian (cutting melee), Purna (guns), Logan (throwing).

Each character has their own skill, similar to how Borderlands did it, as well as access to passive talents that increase different attributes or modify said skill.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Crafting[/b]
There are several upgrade paths with increasingly better versions unlocked by finding blueprints that are located at different areas in the game. Some of them are hidden, some of them are placed in plain sight and some are awarded by completing main/side quests. Upgrades also change the looks of the weapon you apply them to.

[b]+ Visual design[/b]
From the aforementioned weapon upgrades, to the design of zombies and how they visibly take damage as you hit them with their body aprts getting breken or cut off. The island itself is beautiful and the resort looks like somewhere you might like to spend a nice weekend at if not for the zombies.

[b]+ Passable combat[/b]
You can swing your melee weapon and while you aim at an enemy - a small reticle appears on their body indicating where your melee strike will land. Mostr weapons feel similar though.

There is a decent amount of zombie variations. For example, you have slow-moving walkers who can grab you in melee. You have the running infected, who are fast and attack quick, but have low HP. There are big zombies that can knock you down with a single hit and take a lot of punishment, but are very slow and telegraph their attacks. Then you have special zombies that appear very rarely, like huge, tied-up ramming-zombies that charge at you at high speed and must be dodged so they smash into a wall, or exploding zombies that must be killed from range.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Poor writing[/b]
A lot of characters have very bad dialogue lines. There is one scene in particular that's handled in an idiotic way and it's clear to me that the writers have bitten off more than they could chew with that. I will put the following in spoiler tags for 2 reasons:
1 - it's a main plot-point spoiler
2 - it could be triggering to people

[spoiler]There is a point in the story where you are tasked with finding a bunch of food supplies for the survivors. You and other main characters head out accompanied by a girl-mechanic Jin, who you earlier rescue from zombies (a simplification, but explaining everything would take too much time). This takes you to a whole new area of the island where you meet 3 other survival groups, 2 of them being friendly and 1 of them being very hostile 'bandit' type group who took over a police station (implying they are criminals from before the zombie outbreak). All of the groups are low on supplies too and also need food badly. After many quests you finally find a food stash. Jin then says that there's enough food for every survivor group out there, including the violent group mentioned earlier. Main characters rightfully say something like ""fuck those guys, they shot at us multiple times, we are not helping them, we are just going to share among the 'good' survivor groups"". After some other quests that involve you moving the food to your truck the Jin takes off without you with the intention of sharing the food as she proposed earlier, ignoring main character's opinions - including going to the bandit camp, who are barricared up in a police station.

I'm sure you know where this is going.

When you get back to the survivor camp it appears that the Jin did not return for a while. As you go out in search for her, a different survivor who was with her as she drove off to share the food basically tells you that she got captured and the bandit guys are going to rape her. You launch an attack on the police station and find the girl after she clearly got raped already (although nothing explicit is shown - no bruises or marks on her, not even torn clothes, she has the same character model as always). The scene is handled poorly in and of itself, with Sam B immediately accusing the clearly abused girl of betraying them and the girl main characters shoving men out of the room. However, the entire plot point just feels off like it does not belong here.

I think a rape-plot could be handled well and be a strong motivator for player characters if written better. Maybe if those assholes at the police station had some kind of leverage that made the girl go there other than the fact that she wanted to share food out of kindness? The aftermath is likewise, handled badly as no effort is put to make the character model stand out. I mean she clearly got sexually abused - why on earth is her character model looking like normal with same clothes, etc? If you want to handle a serious, triggering topic like this you can't half-ass it - it just makes it seem like you've put it in there for shock value. If the motivation behind her going to that clear trap was better and the consequences were shown appropriately I would probably feel sick to my stomach (as I can't handle rape scenes in anything), but at least it would have done it's job of giving context as to how fucked-up the world has quickly became once zombies destroyed the society. For ""good"" depictions of rape in media look no further than Berserk anime, where the rape in itself is horrible, but there is a very long buildup and a logical explanation for why it happened and when it does - it serves a purpose other than shock value alone.[/spoiler]

[b]- Characters[/b]
Aside from Sam B being an idiot at a scene described in the spoiler, Purna is a sexist. Shitty people like Purna do exist in real life, so this could be seen as a good thing that assholes are represented in the main cast.

Xian is the most level-headed of the group. She is honest, but considerate and stands as the best character out of the main cast. Logan is lacking in the personality department and is usually the least interesting.

Other than that we have many supporting heroes, with lifeguard Sinamoi as a positive standout - he is the first helping hand as well as the main driving force behind quests for the majority of the game.

[b]- FoV[/b]
Already described.

[b]- No cool loot[/b]
All loot is just a bunch of stats. There's no cool stuff that completly changes the gameplay like in Diablo.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
A mediocre game that does what it set out to do, which is a simple Diablo clone in a zombie outbreak situation viewed in first-person. It can be a bit heavy-handed with it's themes and bad writing, but the gameplay itself is what I expected.
I'd give Dead Island a

After the zombie apocalypse strikes a tropical island resort, the player character embarks on a light but compelling RPG, zapping zombies in innumerably diabolical ways whilst pursuing simple fetch quests over a series of respectably large and varied levels. After two complete playthroughs of the original edition, I snagged the Definitive Edition in a Steam sale a few years ago and relived the fun with nicely upgraded graphics. I write this review at the start of a 4th playthrough, so Techland must have done something right.

Compared with the incomparably more finished and much darker Dying Light, Dead Island certainly has its rough edges. The game's various attempts at edginess and pathos are often unintentionally hilarious - when they don't simply fall flat. But the core business of dispatching the undead is solid enough. Perhaps it's just me, but compared with spending a month researching, installing and tuning mods for a fresh playthrough of something like Fallout 4, the ability to almost immediately start playing Dead Island's undemanding and relaxing fare has considerable appeal. Undemanding and relaxing, that is, unless, one gets mobbed by zombies, in which case the intensity level can spike abruptly!

All this said, out of the box, DIDE does require some tweaking to be playable. First, go to PCGamingWiki, https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Island:_Definitive_Edition, and apply the recommended fixes for increasing FOV, and removing Chromatic Aberration and the immersion-breaking crosshair.

Then, go to this topic on the Steam Forums titled 'Control delay/lag?' https://steamcommunity.com/app/383150/discussions/0/364043054119097520/?ctp=2; look at the last post by D.A.R.K. that details how to modify the MoveAcceleration and MoveDeceleration parameters. Setting these both to ~20 virtually eliminates the annoying (in fact, almost game-breaking) 'inertia' effect on the movement of the player character.

As a final touch, I recommend disabling vsync (both in-game and via any 3rd party software like the Nvidia control panel) to reduce mouse lag to a bearable level.

Everything about this game was wrong. Slow combat, all based on hit-and-dodge 1vs1 fights (more zombies can instantly kill). Silly quests (bring me my teddy bear / get me champagne so I can get racked), reckless weapon repair system (you can fix them yourself at any workbench, but you must pay to use it, even if it is a stranded one) and car behaviour on the road (it kinda ""swims"" on the road) made me feel like I'm playing in a higher budget indie game.

So my problem was I was playing it solo and it's a co-op game and this is where all the fun is. Fighting groups of zombies is way much easier with one friend already, not mentioning gathering full set of four. You have to have your friends though, most of the cases when you try to join a public game gonna gets you being kicked out. Or get blown out and then kicked.

My change of mind took place after finishing the first act. I realised the main story isn't that silly like all the side-quests and I find it maybe not very amusing, but pleasant. Story mode gave me around 20h+ of fun, but the true maple syrup is in the Bloodbath Arena. After hitting lvl 50 you can gather your friends and play together on Very Hard arena against hordes of zombies. And as the name say, it's a real bloodbath. Every wave spawns more and more zombies and they become more and more powerful. Game is awarding you for getting thru waves by spawning zombies carrying special weapons you can loot. I only wish there was more bloodbath zones, it's only four in game and they are different difficulty levels, so you ends up playing only Very Hard map.",1615830836,1615830836,True,15,1,0.699627578258514404,1,True,False,False

Dead Island Definitive Edition is an enormous and densely packed zombie adventure that often left me completely awestruck with both its visual spectacle and excellent combat. By steadily introducing new abilities instead of stat upgrades, its combat manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign. One thing worth mentioning is the gunplay. The gunplay is just so absolutely stunning, I really couldn’t believe it! It kept me engaged the whole time, trying to get all the headshots and shooting the limbs off the zombies, it was really fun! The environment is so well put together, it really sends chills down your spine in some areas. The sewer missions are especially well done. I really enjoyed my time creeping through the sewers, shaking in my boots as I’m hoping the zombies won’t jump out of the shadowy crevices and attack me. The mission variety is incredible, not like most open world games with a few different kinds of missions, in Dead Island Definitive Edition, there are barely any repeated objectives. Another thing worthy of mentioning is the absolute polish in this game. The developers really seem like they care about this game, and spent a lot of time ironing out any bugs before the release of the Definitive Edition. It may actually be the most polished game I have ever played. I have greatly enjoyed this game in the time I have played. The characters are beautifully put together, the animations are gorgeous, and the scenery is breathtaking. I wouldn’t trade the time I have spent in this masterpiece of a game for anything in the world. Dead Island Definitive Edition is more than a step up from the original. I wouldn’t even call this a “Definitive Edition”, I would consider it more of a “Masterpiece Edition”. I would try to find anything bad about this game, but all I can think of is that I get so engaged I forget how long it’s been since I started. The multiplayer in this game is also very good, and surprisingly challenging. You may think that because you have four people you would just breeze through the game, but the difficulty scaling is very well done, and you can’t really just team up on all of the zombies. You have to go in with a strategy, not just run in blindly swinging your weapons. It really makes the multiplayer a hugely enjoyable aspect to the game. Overall, I would give this game a perfect score, 100/100!

I can see how Dying Light is, in a way, a spiritual successor to this game combat wise, but without the movement there really isn't much going for it. The story is pretty good so far, but some side missions are basically just an easy way to make cash without it really going anywhere. A guy asking for alcohol or a woman asking for a water which can be repeated several times. It doesn't really matter what you pick up, because everything is turned into cash which is turned into upgrades and repairs for weapons. Fighting zombies can be fun, sometimes, but fighting anything other than a runner or a normal zombie is basically just hit them and hope they go down first.

I haven't played dead island riptide, but from what I've heard and seen it looks like this game just slightly shorter, so I think that game would probably be more worth your time since a lot of this game just felt like boring grinding, it felt like there were maybe 9 hours worth of game stretched to be almost 15 hours (I did end up beating the game)",1613550198,1613550198,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dead island Definitive edition (DIDE) is like L4D2 but you're in an open world with quests, fast travel, vehicles, and an actual story line with some quirks. DIDE has a focus on combat, and the styles within it. each character has a specific set of skills tailored to a specific weapon type, Blunt, Sharp, Throwing, Guns. the story isn't perfect but serves to motivate you to move forward, though the side quests are the meat of this game and consist of you going around solving others problems for money because you are immune/very resistant to the virus for some reason (no spoilers). However, there is one problem that plagues the story game. The end boss. The end boss is poorly made and a bad experience. he's nearly as fast as you, insanely tough, the explosives meant to damage him take too long to set off. he never stays still long enough to be attacked. he also packs huge knockback, which is the only good thing. it gives you distance to him, but you take damage. its a horrible experience to fight, and maybe I'm just bad but i spent a long time in this game, i shouldn't have this much trouble with it when playing a style that's notorious for being the easy way to play. The only bugs I've encountered are good ones that have helped me, and for the sake of keeping the experience pure i will not explain the glitches i used to progress faster and avoid grinding for money. overall 8/10 alone and 9/10 with others",1583653547,1613296532,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Characters[/h1]
—There are four people to choose from and they have their strengths and their own special ""fury"" ability: Sam B. with his fists, Xian Mei with her blade weapons, Logan Carter with throwing weapons, and Purna with her pistol. Ryder White is a character choice; he's the main character in the Ryder White DLC and uses his pistol for fury.

—There are other characters you interact with, but mostly they are part of the story and are kind of forgettable.

—There's one NPC that helps you store items, so cool, I guess?

—NPC repeatable quests? Annoying as hell. Ex: ""OH THANK GOD!""

[h1]Atmosphere/Environment[/h1]
—The environments are a wide variety: wide-open, tropical-vista views of the ocean and sunshine; cramped, desolated, blood-ridden areas inside tunnels; and dark, creepy houses and closets. Oh, also, there's a lighthouse.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
—There are so many zombies and so many ways to dispatch them: beat them, kick them, stomp them, shoot them, chop their heads off, throw weapons at them, blow them up with explosives, throw Molotov cocktails at them, use your special ability, electrocute them—SO MANY WAYS, GO F*CKING CRAZY!

—This game is fun exploring and killing zombies alone, but with more people involved it is a BLAST to play through!

—Crafting is amazing in this game; there are so many combinations and types of weapons to craft that can really knock zombies off of their own feet. There are secret blueprints hidden around the world to find, and those are worth the price of discovery and crafting

—You have a skill tree—fury, combat, survival—with lots of new abilities, and the best ones that I recommend are anything that gets you cash, more stamina, durable weapons, and the execution-style head smash. Two feet is the best!

—Ryder White's DLC has a BIG problem with infected zombies; there are so many that appear and chase you that you are placed into a position where you have to get lucky and throw grenades and run away. Despite having effective medkits, health, and stamina, you cannot upgrade Ryder's stats. Thankfully this DLC is shorter than the main game.

—NPC's are kind of helpless when they get surrounded; be sure to throw weapons at the zombies.

[h1]Enemies/Allies[/h1]
—Your zombie rundown is as follows: walkers move slow; infected move fast; straightjacket ones charge you; thin-skinned bubbly ones explode at close range; floaters that move slow and puke on you from a distance; butchers that are a pain to fight and dispatch; and humans that wield pistols, rifles, and shotguns.

—There are a couple of boss fights, one being towards the end of the campaign before [spoiler] you board the helicopter with Charon [/spoiler]

[h1]Story[/h1]
—Beginning intro of someone getting drunk makes no sense character-wise; you just wake up disoriented—probably from too much drinking or someone slipped you a roofie or something—to find that the entire island has been riddled with human-craving zombies due to a mass virus. Surprisingly, you and y our acquaintances are somehow immune. [spoiler] Your crew must then make your way off of the island because it's about to be destroyed by a nuclear strike. [/spoiler] 

[h1]Boss(es)[/h1]
—There are small mini-bosses known as thugs. Each one may have a weakness in their arm, leg, or torso where a critical hit is possible. Be sure to attack those weak points for an easy kill.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
—As previously mentioned in the Atmosphere category, the visuals in the sunlight on beaches is very pleasant to look at, even on HDR monitors. Everything else that's shot in the dark seems to be low-textured and were meant to be there.

[h1]Music[/h1]
—The music in this game is not memorable, but kind of smoothing as background noise; the menu music is self-explanatory, the ambiance in safe zones are appropriate, and of course the action sequences. The lighthouse one is somber yet peaceful—my second favorite. The main trailer music by Giles Lamb is the most memorable out of all of them.",1611636357,1611636357,True,19,0,0.702748596668243408,1,True,False,False

This game is an open world sandbox experience that is not too overwhelming. I don't know about you but I prefer my sandboxes to be large but not too large. This is so if I return to this game months later it will be simple to pin point where I was in the game. 

The graphics to me are still very beautiful. Especially the PC version (Definitive Version) compared to the 2011 version on Xbox 360 there is no comparison.

One of the things that might put people off in Dead Island is the stamina bar. If you're used to action games like Dark Souls this shouldn't be a problem. 

Quests can be on the repetitive side but the fact that you can really customize your talent trees make for a nice goal to work towards.

If you're into using firearms vs melee Dead Island might disappoint. My first playthrough i went to 80% completion using melee. Guns are pretty rare. 

Dying/Upgrading/Repairing weapons is very expensive in this game. When you die you lose a fuck ton of money.

I just looked at the x360 version of the game, it looks REALLY REALLY good, however they downgraded the graphics for some reason which is a big minus from me, for some reason game developers always do this, when it comes to PC, they lower the graphics if its a console port, just like how SEGA did with the SADX port.
They remove effects, put new horrible effects, removes things, and somehow companies like this manage to make the game worse. Maybe they dont have their old potential and thats fine, but why dont you hire new people for that shit? Like cmon bro, its Definitive Edition, its supposed to be better but its worse, i'll buy their other games as well because i liked the series, i played this on xbox one, i remember it being much better on xbox one but correct me if i'm wrong, they even REMOVED guns, and removed melee weapons, like why would you do that? The zombies were much scarier on xbox360 and xbox one, anyway i avoided horrible bugs, i avoided ugly characters and finished the game, and the bugs were fucking hilarious, my guy at prison was literally shooting at me behind a wall, he got me 2 times, thats not fair now is it?

But honestly i'm giving it a 8/10, say whatever you want but the story was atleast decent and i had fun chopping zombies heads I mean, atleast its playable and it made me actually scared when i first started, and then after like 3 hours i got used to those painful screams, I do recommend the game however.",1611148489,1611148489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Between this version, original (steam), and my first copy on PS3; I probably have around 500 hours invested.  (And to be clear, 0 of those hours are multiplayer : this review focuses on single player only)

This is a very fun game, with great melee combat.  It is fun to just waste an afternoon running around this island resort, leveling up your character (grinding) and eviscerating the undead.  It is very zen.  The 4 maps are all great, very detailed, and provide plenty of incentive for exploration.  There are tons of weapons, and very simple crafting system.

The story is typical zombie fare, and a single playthrough with one character will probably take around 40 hours.

I wish that one day we would get a true sequel to this (NOT Dying Light; this game is superior to that, and a different type of game; IMHO).  And no; riptide does not count either.  I would honestly avoid that title, unless you get a package deal or something in which case you can import your original character.

- First person perspective
- The story is ok
- Map Size
- Visuals look decent for a game that'll run on an 8 year old gpu

Cons:
-Bugs and Combat bugs
-Poor design in some areas
-Melee combat (the wrong skill tree will make this boring and frustrating)
-Health is plentiful when you need it, and non-existent when you do.
-Annoying, screaming zombies that spawn every few minutes (typically 50ft away in a bush)

-Death costs a % of your money.
Unlike Borderlands, money doesn't come quite as easily and there are no 2nd winds in singleplayer.

-Just like Dying Light, there's a problem with factory OC'd video cards that will cause an occasional crash.
The solution is to de-tune your card a bit before you start the game.

-By far one of the worst parts of this game is that weapons can disappear if they're thrown.
You know, one of the core gameplay mechanics of the game?
This forces you to pick between holding onto your rare machete or sacrificing it to Dev-Hell.

At this point I'm just trying to finish the game to get it over with.
I'd recommend this game if it's on sale for 5$.

383150,84655970,76561198034577183,0,28,3184,0,964,1615148512,"Things Required to play DEAD ISLAND:

1) Actually only a few bucks, very cheap when on sale
2) Desire to see many people in serious need of a dentist (and hear them roar when they don't get help)
3) Time to get used to the post apocalyptic controls
4) All Love in your heart for humans and animals must be surrendered
5) It's best if you work at a crematorium, as this will prepare you for ""DEAD ISLAND""  dun dun dun...

BUT, What does DEAD ISLAND GIVE YOU? (If you gotta give all that up, then it must give somethin' back right?  dun dun dun....   here is the list.  I promise you will get all of these things but perhaps not necessarily in the order in which they were written (dun dun dun....) :

1) NEW DIRECTION IN LIFE:  This game gives you new direction in life by instilling you with an insatiable desire to slice off heads of zombies, men, and women, and even stuffed animals (although no animals were actually hurt during the production of this video game) .  You do this with cycles, kitchen knives, cleavers, electric knives, and many other sharp objects. The ""one slice off the head shots"" will give you addictive pleasant memories and fantastic dreams and a super real reason to wake up in the morning... to play again and again and slice off more heads (of course).  Parents. teachers, siblings, friends, church friends, boy scout leaders, brownie group leaders, and pastors should be REAL proud of us all.  Afterall, no one ever said it's easy being a zombie demon slayer.  

2) A NEW SUPER POWER and PASSION that will get everyone's attention:  A new ability to make all friends and pastor folk sincerely concerned about you and give you an amazing amount of attention.  I mean, attention in a way where they will call you daily end even multiple times a day just to make sure you are - uh, alright.  Simply tell them you found a new passion.  Tell them (squint your eyes and lower your voice as much as possible and let the words come out slow and scratchy) that in all  your spare time you are, uh - slicing off heads by the thousand and love watching the blood come from peoples neck. And as the heads tumble to the ground you soak it all in as if it is in slow motion. Tell them you love shooting your pistol to blow out brains, and of your love for the crunch of the hammer on the back of ""human skull"" calls your name at night.  Follow that up with your admission of a new taste for kicking women in the prone position in the crotch, and men that are in the prone position in the crotch, well... until they die. Tell them kicking people on the ground in their crotch until they die is your new THANG!  Your thang man! Your thang!  I GAR-A-NTEE you will have more attention than flies on fresh crap in the middle of a hot summer day in Missouri.  Yeee-hah!!!!

3) ENDLESS MEANS OF KILLING and KILLER MUSIC SCORE:  You will be granted by Dead Island and associates (except camels and lamas who did not agree to this),  access to an endless supply of new ways to kill people (dead and alive) while listening to theater quality music scores.  Not sure why the camels did not like this idea so they were sent back to the farm. The lamas were given pajamas and a salty pacifier.  Which helped keep them quiet long enough to publish the game.

4) VISITATION RIGHTS TO PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS DENTAL ISSUES: Endless supply of people that have a need to visit the dentist more than you do. Which if you are like me, is  a huge huge plus because I hate feeling self conscious about those types of things!  Once you realize that you have the Tom Cruise smile in the room, the rest is all down hill!

5) LOOTY FROM THE BOOTY! Last but not least: You will find that you can take amazing amounts of money, batteries, and wire from an endless stream of bikini bottoms.  Just one pull (or maybe several kicks or slices) on their strings and out comes the booty prize!  Where do the ladies actually put that loot anyway? I guess the folks at Dead Island know me better than I do, cuz it never gets old taking the loot from bikini bottoms... it just doesn't ever get old.  It seems like it should, but nope, it doesn't.  Guess that is why they made endless amounts of bikini bottom zombie x-barbie chicks for me to slice and kick.

(FUN an ENERGETIC GAME with rpg elements and story ... fun to play with a friend or alone!  Get it now or get eaten by a score of zombies!  Seriously... Buy it... what are you waiting for? Quit reading this... stop it!  I am waiting for you to go buy it and stop reading this and am not going stop writing until you do... well,  there you go again reading this sentence.  Oh well, buy it on sale or whenever then... but don't blame me if you are not prepared for your new life mission or if you miss out on your true passion in life!)",1610608015,1610608015,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Quests are pretty surface level. The driving controls terribly (some inputs will not read, if you crash the car simply gets stuck in place instead of bouncing or powering through, even if you're held back by a pebble's length of a collider).

The last time I played was a couple years ago before I bought this version and I thought, ""Man this game is still so much fun, I just wish the graphics were updated.""  Well, that's what this is.  The game is exactly the same in every way except the graphics, complete with frustrating bugs and movement issues.  I may be biased by my unreasonable enjoyment of the game but I never found those things to be game-breaking or enough to dim my joy.  Honestly, I'd rather the bugs stayed than have the devs tinker with programming and end up breaking something else, though they are talented programmers as made clear by the fantastic Dying Light.  Because there's so little difference this is functionally a review of both the old and new version.

I always loved the environment and aesthetic of the game, especially the dichotomy of being in a beautiful resort filled with aggressive zombies.  When it first came out, the concept of sprinting, screaming zombies wasn't common and it was intimidating.  It still is once you're at a higher level and the zombie levels scale with (and surpass) you.  Mismanage three runners on their approach and you're probably dead but it's so satisfying to dispatch them with style.  A bullet in the leg of one, a thrown hatchet in the forehead of another, kick one off its feet, cut the other's head off with an electrified machete, and end the last one with a jumping head-stomp and tell me you don't feel like a boss.  Weapon modding and skill trees are a great part of the game, with different weapon preference and skill trees for each of the main characters.  If you don't aim for the jumping head-stomp move as early as is reasonable you're going to have a hard time at higher levels because weapon degradation takes its toll and repairing high-end weapons isn't cheap, plus you lose a big chunk of cash when you die.  The co-op is also good if you can find a person/people around your level (to preserve the level-scaling) and it's fun driving over zombies in a truck with two people in the bed and one in the passenger seat.  Having all four characters in-game with their strengths overlapping means you get to absolutely slaughter the dead.

Unfortunately all the old issues persist but are easily avoided if you stay aware of them.  For example, there's a glitch where a weapon in your inventory will just *poof* disappear when you mod them, which sucks when you just dropped a bunch of money upgrading the strength of a top-line machete, then apply the mod and it's gone.  This is avoided by putting the weapon you want to mod in your hot-bar/quick-select and equipping it before modding, works every time.  Similarly, be careful with thrown weapons because they have a habit of disappearing as well, especially if you throw one in a panic and get killed anyway.  When you respawn the weapon will be gone, guaranteed.  I just avoid throwing my primary weapons in general, and only throw my secondaries (modded knife or hatchet) if I'm certain I'm not about to get swamped and killed.  Third thing is, it's still kind of ridiculous that being inside of an armored truck gives you no protection whatsoever.  Zombies will punch you through the door no problem and I've been one-shotted by a high-level knife-throwing zombie directly through the front window despite the metal bars over it.  I can only assume he was an expert marksman in his past life.  The last complaint is the movement, arguably the most frustrating thing in the game.  Gaps that appear big enough to pass through quickly become a death-trap as the dead surround you from behind and you jump impotently trying to escape.  Your movement can stop cold running into the wrong six-inch tall curb, stuff you should be able to jump over resists your efforts and occasionally a jump-kick looks spot-on and upon landing you get your head knocked off.

Like I said, none of this is game-breaking.  Losing a good weapon sucks but there will be more and money lost getting killed by the movement issues will quickly be replaced.

Optimized as heck, no weird glitches (even tho you can get stucked somewhere, be careful), the details are just... Amazing. If I have to compare it to Dying Light, I must say this is the lightweight version of it.

The Definitive Edition has a pretty big rework on textures and some UV maps, probably normals for light reflection too. Still, the game does an awesome job, except for the very dark areas, you can't see, at all, so be careful with gamma.
And, achievements are a little bit buggy, same as time played. I got like 9 achievements + 10 hours and steam didn't recognize them. Might be a glitch on my client? I doubt, a friend has the same issue.

Still, awesome game after all these years! Little bro of Dying Light.

383150,83199336,76561198062316139,0,3,13956,53,224,1708184370,"I have played this game almost since its release on other platforms before Steam,so I guess I should give my honest opinions about this game and the future of this franchise.

1.Introduction:
Dead Island 1 (2010) fresh off the heels of the recently released Borderlands (2009) is a hack and slash/semi open world/cookie cutter zombie game with a slight hint of tropical paradise gone wrong game.The first time I played this game I was captivated by the stunning scenery and well rendered zombies,almost every piece of elements in the game were well done for their time.
2.Game design and gameplay:
Like I said Dead Island is beautifully done for its time.However what displeases me is the recent HD improvement theyve done with the definitive edition,the water physics and look are absolutely ugly compared to the original.Who thought it was a good idea to turn the beautiful blue water in Banoi into some jello sea.The ammount of glitches I also had to deal with and which are present even today in the definitive edition,such as zombies running into invisible walls or clunky AI which cant decide on killing you or getting angry at some rubble in the road.And dont even get me started on the NPC faces,even young women in this game look like withered hags for some reason.I think the designers at deep silver need to look at how women look like and take some drawing classes.

The gameplay is very formulaic and clunky in some places,one could notice the very ankward motion of the characters arms when they attack something/the air.What is fun about the gameplay however is the ammount of weapons and their rarity (an element borrowed from Borderlands) one could use to dismember and kill zombies/humans.Legit the best thing about this game is the possibility of modifying already good orange tier legendary weapons into death machines and I'm stunned other games havent copied this.Imagine if in Borderlands you could modify a rpg to shoot both fire and electricity or increase splash damage by finding schematics with parts.

3.Story:
The story is typical to the zombie genre,pretty sure there are other zombie games which are similar and escape my memory at the moment which have done the same thing.The story however has its highlights but like I said its basically the tropical paradise gone wrong scenario,the good elements of the story I'd say are the following:
-the ""zombie"" virus is a mutated version of the very real and ugly K'uru disease from papua new guineea.They tried hard and somewhat succeeded into making the way this thing spreads and affects people very credible.So I'll give them props to that a very good idea.
-the whole idea of escape from Banoi is premeditated on the idea of some random millitary dude giving you the ok and sending a helicopter for you.Thus giving you the false sense of security only to realise the further you go in the story that the more screwed you are.This entire story makes you feel like youre the pawn of different factions furthering their own ends.Theres alot of plotwists which are genuinely cool,such as Charon the hacker posing as Rider White and tricking you into believing the real White is the bad guy screwing everything up.
-the idea of 4 playable characters still being present in cutscenes and having an impact in the story,a thing even borderlands wasnt capable of doing right.Some of the best parts of this game is the interaction between the 4 characters or the main characters with npcs.Like when Sam B commenting how that was some ""night of the living dead type of shit going on"".
Now for the bad parts of the story:
-the idea of 4 characters being immune to the disease is such a deus ex machina element that it begs belief how these people with 0 negative blood wont be zombified even if theyre killed.
-the end of the story is retarded in many ways.Many of the characters that have stuck with you from the beginning end up being dead because of ridiculous writing,like Jin dying because the writers decided she has to annoy the secondary ""villain"" of the game.And all the side missions youve done to ensure their wellbeing like the Church sanctuary,the jungle village and the lifeguard sanctuary end up being useless because at the end you leave everything behind Banoi before a fucking thermonuclear bomb annihilates everyone on the island.So all the stuff youve done in game and all those people youve met,its all pointless.Somehow Sinamoi and a couple others didnt end up radioactive BBQ because Deep Silver realised how stupid the end of D I is.
-many side missions that are semi related to the main story are either fetch quests or some npc being a retard and forgetting something in some house they lived in.I hope that Dead Island 2 will have better side quests than the first one.Some story elements of this game from sidequests dont go anywhere ,like Nikolai and his russian buddies coming to help us.You end up running in circles doing nothing.

4.Sound effects and music:
Another good element of this game is probably the ammount of effort that went into sound design and bringing to life this island.The way the zombies groan,roar or pant when they run is done well.One could hear sometimes the hordes of zombies clatter far away in the background or how certain zombie sounds indicate a special type of infected.Its really spooky if its your first type playing it and you hear a Ram infected in the background.
The ambient soundtrack is also beautifully done in this game.Some of my favourite ambiental tracks in this game are the Overpass camp and Jungle Danger ones.The tracks really do immerse you into the game and set the tone from the start.

5.Conclusions and future:
Overall Dead Island,for me atleast,is well worth it (especially now thats 5 euros on steam for the definitive edition).The game may not be the best installment in the zombie genre but theres something about it thats endearing and fun to play,whether its the island itself or the pretty innovative gear/weapons system (when you have a baseball bat which literally throws zombies 100 meters away then you know its fun) its worth it.
One will wonder what the new developers will do with Dead Island 2 after Riptide was basically an expansion pack for Dead Island.The future seems very uncertain for this franchise,with so many ideas being thrown around and so much time passing away,one would wonder if they will manage to recapture that magic the original game had.",1608988527,1608988930,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Games saves became corrupted after about two months of playing. I'm on a modern PC, 32GB RAM, Intel/Nvidia, 3 HDD... I lost over a week of grinding and completed missions, and it's been tough trying to get back into it.

I'd recommend backing up your saves every few plays, because otherwise you will get stuck and demotivated to continue. This is a known issue I wish they would patch since the game is still being sold.

The game up to that point was honestly pretty phenomenal. It's not too easy, not too difficult. I like the open world feel to it. I was completely surprised that the action and story were that good... I thought it was going to be a really dumb game tbh. There's a lot of depth to the missions and inventory. Upgrading weapons is useful. One of the grinding aspects is that you have to constantly repair your weapons--even strong, ""durable"" upgraded ones.

It's hard to find any big complaints gameplay-wise, other than maybe some missions are dumb and tedious, and the travel around can be slow at times.

The other glitchy issue I ran into was that sometimes a completed mission would reset when you left that area. I understand enemies respawning, but when you play a scavenging game like this with scarce resources, it's not fun to have to continually face the same area a few times before the game registers the mission completed... because of a game glitch.

Definitely a game that could have benefited from more QA testing prior to launch.

I got it on a good sale so I can't complain too much for being an unexpected hit. Just a big let down that the saves don't stick.",1607904514,1607904514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphical touch ups are greatly welcome and help update the mid-7th generation muddy textures to something more presentable. In that sense, it's a very faithful adaptation of the original game for modern audiences.

On the flip side however, this remaster fails to update the game's sluggish/stiff movement or limited FOV for modern expectations. While I understand the Dev team behind this remake likely didn't have a particularly long time to work on the game, nor did they have the clearance to overhaul such systems, it's disappointing to see an otherwise solid experience like Dead Island not be better polished aside from a spit shine. 

I wouldn't say this kills any enjoyment you could have with the game, but understand that you have to accommodate the game more than it's willing to accommodate you. If you want to give this game another try after playing it before, this is certainly a good way of doing so.

And the only way i can describe how bad it is is to use sarcasm. I will spoil the living 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐭 out of this game. But i really doubt someone actually cares much about the story. 
I wanted to buy this game for a pretty long time. Mostly after i became addicted by Dying Light and heard it was a game developed by the same people, Techland. Well, and Deep Silver, but we don't talk about them. And oh, boy, was i disappointed when i first played it. The movement felt so slow, even though i use a pretty high DPI, it felt like i was actually lagging the whole time. My game only went below 40FPS in some areas, but all the time it was above 60. Yet, it always felt like i'm playing at 40 or even lower. It never felt like i played this game smoothly, at 80fps. But i'll get into that in a second. First things first, i'll start with what i like about the game, because it's a short list. lol.


Pros:

You can choose between 5 playable characters. Each with their ups and downs, one's a blunt weapon expert, one guns expert, one sharp weapons expert, etc. I cannot talk too much about the other characters, as i always played with Xian Mei, the sharp weapons expert. I don't like the rest of 'em. But the game gets a few extra points for having more playable characters.

You can play as the same character in co-op. I never knew that, and its a really great feature. When i first played this game, i let my ex use Xian, and i used Logan, because i thought it wouldn't be possible to play as the same character. But turns out you can have a fully lobby of Xian or Logan, or Sam B. lol. It's quite neat, if you ask me. 

The combat mechanics and the gore are quite satisfying. Each weapon is moddable with different effects, toxic, electricity, fire, etc. And you can even mod the guns. Explosive rounds for the rifles, or electrical bullets for the pistol. 
The game has a vast variety of weapons, from what i've seen. Hammer, machete, katana, axe, knife, pipe. shovel, etc.
I only used sharp weapons like knives and katanas, because Xian is the best with them. 
Cutting a zombie from legs to the head is quite fun. Such a shame their head automatically turns bald after you cut it off, lol. Who thought this was a good idea? 

My favorite thing so far about this game is the ""Fury"" ability. Basically, you go Berzerk on everyone, not matter the size. With Xian, i was able to kill about 14-16 zombies in a matter of seconds. And the more you kill, the bigger the XP bonus is. But be aware, the Fury goes quite fast, so make good use of it. And don't try to rush a whole are of armed humans. I tried and it didn't went quite well. 

The game offers a quite diverse variety of locations. You have the beaches, that is an actual dead paradise. You have the slums, a quite depressive area, with junk and blood, and bodies all around the place. Kinda like a normal city from Pakistan. 
You have the Church, that's quite beautiful, even though the uh.. nun, looks like an old, retired pornstar. 
There is also the jungle, which is by far my favorite location in the game. In that location we meet the Butcher, personally, my favorite kind of infected from this game. Also the jungle is by far the most immersive area in the whole game. From the ambient noises, to the environment, and the enemies. You get to fight Native zombies. It's pretty cool. 

Money actually are useful in this game, as you'll need plenty to repair your weapons and buy materials and medkits. The better your weapon is, the more it will cost you to repair it. It's quite fair, to be honest, because you can easily farm money. Especially in co-op. Have a friend play as Sam B, (or more) and you'll get a crapload of money, because Sam B gets bonus cash, and the money your co-op partner gets, counts for you as well. 


Alright, we're done with the good things about the game. Now let's discuss about the bad things, shall we?

I'll start with my OWN problems that i had during this amazing game. 
First of all, the game gave me really bad headaches, that lasted of hours. I have motion sickness. First time i played this game, in 2019, was vanilla, without mods. Never got such a bad headache, especially from a video game. And i know for a fact a lot of other players have this issue as well. 
I have fixed the problems a bit. I mean, i still get a bit dizzy at times, but hey, no headaches. You have to mod your game a bit. Edit some .ini files, increase the FOV, disable the blur, chromatic abberation, depth of field, use a reshade to tone down that damn brightness that burns your eyes. 
Here's the guide i used to fix most of the problems. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1713802838
Cons:

The incredible story, filled with heartbreaking moments, amazing writing. Half-Life 2? Bioshock 1? Nah, screw those games. Dead Island's plot is really complex, and only a genius could fully comprehend it. 
The side characters that give you quests? So relatable. I mean.. i always send people looking for my Teddy bear, or for champagne bottles during the outbreak. 
For real, the story, if you can even call it that, its the most cliche, terrible, cringey, 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐭 out there. And it's not even ""so bad that it's good"" bad, like The Room, it's ""so bad that it makes me wanna stab myself with a spoon"" bad. 
The main characters barely talk in-game, they only talk during the cutscenes. And oh boy, the cutscenes are something aren't they? Each character feels so dead inside. They're eyes are dead and dull, their facial animations, especially Puma's are just.. ew. EW. When they talk, they move their entire face, not only the lips. 
The cutscenes look like they were made by an amateur or indie developer, but in today's age, even indie devs make better cutscenes. I'm not going to lie, i've seen SFM porn with better animations. I'll just put this one here. 
All the characters in this game have the personality of a rock. Xian is the only one that looks and talk like a normal human being. 
The side quests are just as bad, but some, only a few, are better than the main story itself. Won't talk too much about the side-quests, because i've skipped each and every dialog, and they were too damn bad memorize any of them. 
You reach the end-game, right? The man that was supposed to save us all, turned out to run away with the antidote and nuke the island, along with all the remaining survivors there! Oh my, who would've gussed that! Bad guy gets bitten by his zombie waifu, injects himself with the antidote, and becomes the strongest living being! I one-hit killed him with a developer weapon. Our characters leave the island and they all lived happily ever after. 

The movement in this game is one of weirdest stuff i ever seen. You're so slow, like the moving animations were slowed down. It feels so clunky just to walk around. Game runs above 60FPS, but it feels like its on 40. There is mouse lag, as well. And when you try to drive, your camera just becomes SLOW af. I've set my DPI to max when driving only to get a less terrible experience. Climbing stuff is also pretty terrible, because the game has a LOT of invisible walls. Wanna try to get up on that box? Or wanna jump on that roof that's only two feet away from you? Well good luck trying to make that jump with the invisbile Ice Berg right in front of you. 
Thankfully, again, there is a mod that increases the mobility and the speed. Makes the game actually playable. https://www.nexusmods.com/deadisland/mods/26

The game also doesn't have a day and night cycle. It's always day. It's always sunny. The only time when it rains is when you go into the Old Town, Act 2. And ONLY in that location. Amazing.

Before ending this amazing 10/10 review, i have to thank my co-op partner, Natteee for making this game less tedious.

I played many hours of the original version of Dead Island on the Xbox 360 and this version is great too. With that said I do think the original is slightly better. Pictures and posters on walls that showed partial nudity have been replaced with other images and weapon models have been changed. I don't like either of these changes but for me they don't make the game less fun. Here is a terrible change. The damage stat on weapons has been changed to DPS so it is hard to know how hard each weapon hits. I thought I found a high damage knife but actually it just swings fast.

The definitive edition doesn't change anything it should have and instead changed things that were fine in the original.

The zombie spawn system is horrible, it's like playing call of duty deathmatch, they literally crawl out of your rectal canal. 
Zombie voice actors did good job, those are some scary zombie sounds when you pair them with running zombies - plus considering the solo factor where you do get swarmed easily and killed (you got to manage stamina too), it is pretty intense, it'll get easier the more you level ofcourse.

it has open world mechanics that doesnt feel that empty, good envyroments (except the city but that is more subjective for me at lest) fun rpg mechanics and a really good co-op experience.
the game has its flaws obviously. The mayor one is the FOV, you cant change it in game, and if you try to do it with any other method, it will glitch your game to the point that you cant loot or kill anything. Another flaw is that the game is full of bugs and glitches (for example one that we found with a friend that if you run over another player you have a chance to downing them)  but this can be hillarious if you are with friends laugthing about everything in the game. I think that is the good point of the game, it is so silly that you will have a great time with your friends.

An exeption of all of this is the dlc of Ryder White, this dlc is just plain awful. Remember all the good thing i said about the game? well the dlc discards all of this, it doesnt have coop, it is a linear story, it doesnt have any type of personalization. Basically the game throws a lot of runners at you in a corridor just to artificially inflate the difficulty, especially at the end part.

You can't turn off the auto aim and can't change the sensitivity when you aim with a gun.
Never in a game my aim was that fucking bad because it is the most clumsiest part of it.
It feel like they added guns as an afterthought just to attract more buyers, not because they really wanted to make it an enjoyable part of a whole and they will fucking force you to use guns with the bandits and the kamikaze zombies just to be even more annoying.

All you do is get close, hit few times, avoid attacks which you can barely see coming, repeat.
For human enemies you just need one headshot and you're done.

+) Graphic is highly improved compared to the original version.
+) Object placement indicator is more clearer than before.
+) Feeling you get from hitting targets, zombies, is very thrilling like before, if not better.
+) Original version has these areas where there are ridiculously a lot of loots but here, they reduced it to a reasonable amount. It still is more than enough so it’s ok.
+) They’ve made more clothes for zombies so it feels like there is more variety.

 Back in the days I enjoyed this game but I didn’t know any better. Now, I see clearly. This game isn’t something I would recommend to others.
-) Side quests make you go back and forth, or go off the rail, which you must stay put if you’ve understood any of the situations you are in.
-) Not only that, you can definitely feel this chore-like “back and forth” design is on purpose. Diminishes the immersion.
-)  This game is mainly designed for sharp weapon class, which is Xian? Yes. Blunt weapons aren’t bad, it has its own “way of use”, but it is definitely inferior to sharp weapons.
-) Besides, most of the rewards are sharp weapons. You do get blunt weapons time to time but they are subpar compared to its counterpart.
-) Speaking of which, Sledge hammer? What is wrong with that weapon? It’s as if developers raised the damage of overall weapons except that one. It is a two-handed weapon and yet its damage is disastrously low. Even lower than a one-handed weapon, that has a lower item level.
-) Oh, yes, They should indicate if an weapon is two-handed or one-handed. You can use it, swing it in the air and find out but come on. Don’t be like that. Hehe
-) Zombie respawn time is too fast from time to time. One particular zombie kept respawning everytime I came out of a container. It was horrible.
-) And since we are going back and forth, seeing the same type of zombies, same number of them, at the same area again and again was chopping my buzz.",1484981736,1602508243,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To put it short this game has aged fairly well at least in my opinion. The graphics still look fantastic all these years later, the zombies scared me multiple times through my playthrough, and overall the enviroments were diverse and helped the game not feel too bland. All of the melee weapons feel satisfying to use. The weapon mods look and help the ""tankiness"" of certain mobs. The hidden objectives scattered throughout the map are a fun addition to the game. The lighting is mesmerizing. 

The zombie AI is wonderful. Each zombie has its strength and weakness and I can see how each character (in a co-op) setting would have something unique to counter said zombies. Multiple times throughout the game I would be doing something just to be ambushed by the running infected zombies. Fantastic. 

Now onto the bad portions of the game. The music. Jesus Christ, the music has to be the biggest short coming of this entire game. The games soundtrack consists of the same four songs it feels like. The combat music is even worse. It got to the point where I just turned the music down due to sheer repetition. 

The overall sound of the game is bad too. Multiple times throughout the game where the sound would bug out and I would have to reload my save. The ambient sounds in certain areas was fantastic meanwhile in places like the city you could go to edges of the map and hear where the ""ambient"" sounds were originating from. 

The game ran flawlessly at first, however, once I made it to the city portion of the games -multiple- times the game was just take a dump and drop from 144 FPS to 15-20 FPS. I would either have to stop and hope the game adjusted itself or just completely quit the game and relaunch. ( At the time of playing this game my rig has a 3900x, 2080 Ti, and 32gb of 3600 DDR4 ram. Well over the recommended specs). I am playing on 21:9 instead of 16:9, however, I don't believe this to be the issue. 

The AI... for humans anyway, is awful. Really. No other terms can begin to describe how pitiful the human AI is. Multiple times the AI would just freeze and not even attempt to shoot in my location if I ""broke"" LOS. (I say broke loosely because I would be hiding behind a pole or something). Thankfully you don't deal with humans too often so that is a bonus. 

Guns are a complete joke and I believe they are there only for novelty sake. Ammo is scarce and to make matters worse guns do next to no damage. Even if you were to play as Purna (the gun chick) I believe they would still be mediocre. One change from the original Dead Island to Definitive Edition is that they have completely ruined shotguns. They used to be a guaranteed critical if aiming at the head, this feature is completely gone and now you have to pump shells into mobs. I just ditched the shotgun after the city due to this. I am also pissed that they ditched the original gun models in favor of the dying light models. In the original game you had the M4, M16, and AK. Now you have this weird AR, a sig 556 clone (that may I add is shared between the single and burst variant) and it leaves you wondering why except for sheer laziness. Also the animations for most of the guns in the game simply do not line up with the new models they have brought from Dying Light (looking at all of the rifles). 

The story is lackluster at best. The voice acting is horrendous and the accents do not help in the slightest. This gets progressively worse the further you progress through the story. The final boss battle is one of the most anti climatic moments in recent gaming history and the side quests can be frustrating (especially the ones that send you back to a location you just came from). 

Finally, the game is extremely short. I played the game solo, took my time doing every side quest and looting -everything-, and still managed to beat it in 18 hours. This game was obviously intended for new game+ and co-op play. For me I just wanted to replay it after all of these years, I just couldn't imagine sinking more time into multiple playthroughs. 

To conclude, despite my many criticisms of the game I still believe it is a gem. The game overall has aged well and the combat is enjoyable enough to make up for the shortcomings of the game. Multiple times through my playthrough I was genuinely scared and the atmosphere of the game is eerie throughout. Don't go into this expecting AAA title quality, however, I would -only- recommend this game if it is on sale.",1602305026,1602305026,True,7,1,0.600525736808776855,0,True,False,False

I have to fetch meaningless items for no reason because the survivor who is never impressive enough for me to feel like helping and just exists for the sake of the only one quest wants it and there's no dynamic whatsoever there.

Yet, I finished it until the end, because I loved it so much. The contrast of light and darkness just appealed to me: sun, beaches, cocktails, zombies, limbs and death everywhere. I have been fortunate enough to spent some time in a luxurious hotel in Cancún, Mexico, so I could easily place myself in the game, amidst the sunny beaches, blue ocean and rotten girls in bikinis ('rotten', in this case, referring to their personality, lol).

The game itself is very violent, bloody, disturbing and definitely not for kids. It also has a lot of bad language (which I am not a fan of, because I find it unpleasantly distracting and unnecessary). The wailing of the undead is unsettling and that makes entering a safe zone even more relieving. There, you can take a breather and safely upgrade and modify your weapons, before heading out again. If you have a car at your disposal, you may as well take it with you, as some of the undead aren’t quite as dead and tend to be a little more aggressive...

With the exception of Xian Mei, I found the other main characters very unlikable. [spoiler]There was one scene in particular that was very traumatizing (like a zombie apocalypse isn’t traumatizing enough), where I was put off by the lack of compassion by Sam B and Logan. Sadly, this is a scripted event and there is no way to prevent it.[/spoiler] Apart from that, each character has three unique skill trees. You can improve the skills of your character by gaining experience points (XP). You gain XP by killing zombies and completing quests. I found it very enjoyable to see my character adapt to the zombie apocalypse, by becoming a better and stronger survivor.

Lastly, I want to give Paweł Błaszczak, the composer of the Dead Island soundtrack, some love. We should never underestimate how important music is for a game and I think Paweł did an excellent job on this, as well as Giles Lamb, who composed a beautiful, award-winning piece for the trailer.

Now, I am well aware the game has its flaws. Even though this is the Definitive Edition (also including all the DLC), it still has its fair share of bugs and glitches. One Steam Achievement is virtually impossible to get (“Gotta find'em all”) and weapons tend to vanish from your inventory after you mod them. But let this not distract you from the fact that this is one hell of a great and terrifying zombie game!

I loved Dead Island then and I love Dead Island now and I will continue to love it, until the day I die and turn into a zombie myself.

The good: 
Nice perk trees encourage progression and aggression.
Weapons are also upgradable, and degrade slow enough so as not to be distracting.
Rarely frustrating level of difficulty.
Generally responsive combat. Zombies are fun to curbstomp.
Nice mix of environments.

The bleh:
Story's okay, but a maybe a bit too serious.
Awkward racial stereotypes with sometimes unintentionally goofy voice acting.
Annoying protagonists (but luckily you don't have to listen to your 'team' often).
Just a serious of fetch quests with zombies in the way.
Some minor glitches where quest objects need to be looked at at just the right angle to register as usable.

You can play one of four characters with their own unique play styles and abilities. The story is about your character being on vacation to Banoi, waking up one morning to the zombie apocalypse, and start to help people on your way off the Island...kind of. The plot is meh. The games' graphics are very pretty and I wish the game took place more on the beach side than where else. Although, this is the first game to give me motion sickless from their driving mechanics. Most of the missions is ether fetch quests or escort. The game has co-op, which is the only way this is kind of fun to play. Having said that, you better off playing another co-op zombie game The NPCs are all stupid, and it tries to make you feel for them, but I just don't care about any of them. There couple of bugs still, like missions not starting or working right. If you really want to play this, wait for a steam sale and drag a buddy or two with you. And I give this a 5.5/10.",1599807827,1599834468,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
