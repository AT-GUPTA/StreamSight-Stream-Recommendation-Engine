You gain access to better weapons and upgrades for your character as you play objectives, side missions, and challenges within the open and long range levels. 
The level design is some of the best I've seen in the industry, having so many routes and options to traverse. 
The sound design is also perfect, the ambiance, guns all sound powerful, footsteps, wind, everything is very immersive. Only gripe is if you sneak passed the same enemies you'll hear the same conversation they were having when you first encountered them.

The autosave is a bit more aggressive so you're not as punished by Groundhog Day chicanery, you still cannot manually save and only a couple autosave slots are available so, plan your moves a bit carefully. 

Most of the loadout seems like a bit of a waste of space as you gravitate to 1 or 2 'meta' weapons like the maximum-silent medium sniper rifle or the crossbow. Instead of treating it like a stealth game though where you can wipe out 100 people without getting detected once (blind as bats, deaf as moles, dumb as rocks - which you can lead them around with), , you can also choose to grab an assault rifle and call-of-duty your way through the pain. They give you a drone again, but they also frequently ban its use from many areas of the maps. 

The scope and scale of the maps here are pretty epic, you can pull off some nice long range shots up to 1.5+ km away, but a lot of the engagements happen at much shorter ranges. The 3rd map of the game has a couple underground complexes that really surprise and impress, even if they don't make a lot of practical sense - all that infrastructure for a glorified bitcoin farm, yeah'okay. 

Completionists might be frustrated that several challenges require repeating maps, eg. kill this target 3/4 different ways. 

Overall a rootin good time with a boilerplate narrative (supersniper sent to fake middle east country to onemanarmy the place to keep the price of oil stable for good ol 'merica - I am not joking) but I don't see any value proposition in any of the DLC (Skin packs? Really?!). Wishlist the game for a sale and have at em. $40 is too much - many of the hours I have on record are idle/background, there's about 30-35 hours here at best and that's taking your time and being sneaky.

This game has more glitches than Carter Pharmacy Co. has liver pills. OR, for you younger ones, LIBERALS speak LIES. IT has a great plot line and the enemy can see you much quicker and almost too good and it makes the game very interesting. The game is a lot of fun but has problems. I played Gh. Warrior 2 over 20 times and contracts even more... much more but this game I will play only a few times because of its NARROWNESS of pot execution. Three or Four BIG drawbacks are: 
It's not very user friendly. It wont let you go up the mountains, it tells you your game will forfeit in 10  seconds with countdown and its very narrow layout in execution of plot. It drives you into a corner then says play. This is a BIG problem. LAST, the suit in CONTRACTS I wear is NOT in this game. SO, your body cannot regenerate your health. ALSO, they made the places where you get the medical things sparse and hard to find and the AMMO refill also few.  I feel like while they were making progress in making this game much more fun, this is a BIG  step back. If I gave  Ghost Warrior 2 - 4 stars ( WHO also has glitches but not a lot ) and CONTRACTS 4.5 Stars, then I would have to give this game 2 stars if that. IT has such potential to be a great game: better than all the others and yet they made this game with very narrow thinking. ALSO, while I like ""MY"" voice and the commander's voice in this (CONTRACTS II ) game, I like I Liked CONTRACTS voices of both better. I wish they would let the public or ME pay their games first before they send it out, I would have fixed this problem quickly. ANYWAY, It is a good game. Its worth having but not at 30 bucks, maybe 10 or so. It is just a big disappointment because I have loved their games, and still do. I will always be a SNIPER GHOST WARRIOR FAN. I wish though they would not change things in the game so much.

This is the first of my Sniper Ghost Warrior series of games, and I really enjoyed it. Overall I think they did a great job with the game. It was fun and challenging, and the game doesn't generally force you into making rash attacks, but seems to encourage careful planning and punish hurried attacks.

One of my gripes is that most secondary weapons, and most ""gadgets"" (grenades, mines, etc) are almost useless because they immediately blow your cover - even if they have a suppressor. The ensuing firefights against all enemies in the location can get frustrating as they seem to immediately know where you are. OK, the game wants to encourage stealthy play - but just give us more secondary and gadget options that are compatible with stealth play. Hence, most of the game tends to be fought with the sniper rifle or a suppressed sidearm.

The save-game feature is a little obtuse. They probably do this to avoid save-scumming missed shots - fair enough, but on occasion you want to go back to a save that was deleted because you happened to move to a different area. In one instance a bounty task finally activated when I was 10' from the save point after finishing the last contract - yet the game auto-saved the region as ""complete"" and basically locked me out of finishing up the bounty.

The automap feature leaves a lot to be desired. With caves, tunnels, and other terrain features not apparent on the map, it can get tedious getting to your preferred location.

Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 refines the gameplay of its predecessor The classic missions offer an experience comparable to that of the last installment, as they involve a mix of infiltration, close-quarter combat, and stealthy elimination of targets closer than 400 meters (1,300 ft). The long-distance shot missions, however, require the player to eliminate targets further than 1,000 meters (3,300 ft). The story plot is about overthrowing a tyrannical government. The game is set in the fictional Middle Eastern country of Kuamar.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]With the game location in the Middle East, seeing a desert and dry environment is a breath of fresh air. The geometry and environments are breathtaking and really put you into the game and looks immersive. The quality here is high end and feels AAA. The UI is clean and easy to read, the character models look realistic and the bullet time with the added gore is absolutely intense. The weapon models are super sharp and look high end and super modern. The animation as well are incredible and using a bolt action feels super satisfying. The scopes (although easy to read and understand) can look messy at times and also can be distracting. They don’t look as minimal as the previous (which looked better in terms of the scope crosshairs).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Gameplay is still as good as the previous game. The sniping is top tier with amazing mechanics and difficulty. Now in this game you will have to take some far shots ranging from 1000+ meters away, and they can be very challenging, but super satisfying to pull off. You have up to 6 main semi open worlds to go through which are pretty small, but do give you some freedom on how to tackle every contract. The weapons and gunplay all feel the best they ever have been. With the shooting mechanics feeling super fluid and not issues. The guns have impact and feel really good to shoot. The Perks are also really good and improve the experience a lot. I never felt them being gimmicky in my opinion. Some of the equipment feels kinda pointless to use at times. For example the drone feels gimmicky here, since the jammers always get in the way (which you can destroy so that is an option). I just saw myself never really needing to use the drone since the scanning mode is really OP and makes the drone feel useless. There are also not a ton of Sniper Rifles here (without the DLC’s of course). And never seen myself using them all since only a few are worth using and kinda look the same. To bring back some good points, the bullet time is easily the best here out of all the Ghost Warrior games. The gore is insane and really feels immersive (especially using a .50 cal). Every map has a set of challenges that rewards stealth and planning. But don't worry since if you don'r care about the challenges, stealth is not a priory here for players that enjoy to go in loud. Sadly the rewards are not really worth the hassle. You can find collectables in this game. Some feel worth getting (like the weapon skins) and others don’t feel important at all. At Least they are super easy to find which is a plus.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story is pretty simple. All you are doing is eliminating corrupted leaders in a tyrannical government. The location is set in the Middle East and every map has a few leaders to take out and some other side contracts. It’s pretty simple, but really fun. Don’t expect an in-depth story here, although I will say this game has a better “story” than the last game. It’s a quick story and it feels pretty easy to understand and follow so that’s a good thing to see. I just wanted a more detailed story compared to the previous game, but it’s still pretty fun at least.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]Going through all the maps and contracts took me around 16 hours to complete. The length is pretty decent. Not much of an upgrade to the previous game, but still pretty solid. The levels do have some replayability since you have challenges to complete. The gunplay is super addicting so if you enjoy sniping you will most likely do multiple runs on some levels. The contracts are pretty quick to beat sadly, so if you are expecting some challenging missions or levels, you probably will be disappointed.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is actually really good here and an improvement from the last game. The guns sound so amazing and the Snipers sound brutal and addicting to shoot. The voice acting is solid and I saw no issues with it here. The music is okay but can be too loud at times. The dialogue for the enemies (although repetitive) sound pretty good as well.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I had some annoying bugs unfortunately. First the environment can be annoying to sneak in. You will get stuck on many objects and having to jump can cause you to get caught, make noise, and can just ruin the immersion at times. The enemy spotting system gets bugged at times so it feels like they are seeing you through walls, but they are not, causing you to be confused. This game does feel less polished than the previous game in terms of bugs and glitches at times. Also the AI can be pretty dumb, and not as good as the previous game in my opinion.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance was good for the most part. Some maps did have some micro stutters (which could just be my old computer). Besides the minor stutter issues (which only happened mainly on one map, the game ran pretty well for the majority of my playthrough. I have had some frame drops in some sections but not too bad. Also no crashes on my playthrough or freezes so that’s a huge plus on my book![/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is a blast of a sniping game. It’s not perfect, as the “story” is forgettable and short, but the satisfaction you get with the gunplay and the map detail is worth the trade. The mechanics are really well done and if you are looking for that sniping game based in the desert, you found the right one! The locations are beautiful and the one range sniping sections are challenging and feel rewarding. Give this game a try if you are into sniping games since this is a must pick if you are![/td]

TL;DR: Game's pretty great, on its own its good, however feels lackluster compared to SGW:Contracts 1

So Sniper Ghost Warrior, has been a fun series for me (aside from SGW 1 that I never finished due it being honestly pretty bad but that's due to just how old it is) and I definitely look forward to the future installments, this one was as stated lackluster, and I will admit its biased as to why and it has to due with my liking SGW:Contracts 1.

Obligatory Spoiler warning here for Contracts 1 & 2

So starting there I like Contracts 1, its atmosphere was amazing and I enjoyed the progression and the choose your way of engagement, if you want a good overview RussianBadger's video is a good place to go.
Contracts 1 ended with the reveal of a shadow organization overseeing the world's affairs and working to keep a level of unbiased ""peace"" them stepping in the deal with people or governments who would disrupt peace on a large scale. This is a concept that is really intriguing to me as an individual and I was looking forward to seeing the idea fleshed out in Contracts 2 with Seeker (the player-character of Contracts 1) and his Handler (The sorta over-viewer/""push-the-player-in-the-right-direction"" character) These 2 had amazing and hilarious synergy in C1 and I was looking forward to more especially now that Seeker was a bit more in the loop.
Sadly for me however Contracts 2 opening with Raven, a ex-military vibe operator, with the voice in his ear being ""control"" (stated by the games subtitles or Alex as he later reveals) a more direct and militaristic type.
This leads into my first disappointment with the game as it feels less like a contractor and hitman/merc and more like just some military operation, C1 with Seeker's attire and mask design he felt like a merc or gun-for hire who was top of his field and a perfect fit and anytime i heard Handler's voice I could picture him in a 2-piece suit giving Seeker just the bare-minimum sometime maybe not even that.

C2's Raven and ""Control"" feel uninspired, copy-paste military guys that you'd find in any military shooter (kinda reminiscent of SGW 2 actually) lots of military code talk and the like. Its a personal bias but it doesn't feel like it warrants the ""Contract"" title, this could've just been SGW: 4 ""Arid Decent"" or something like that and if it had been I probably wouldn't be making this, I did come to warm up to the characters but it took me a while.

Now as far as gameplay goes its a fun experience pretty similar to the previous installments, thematically speaking the fact you start the game with all 3 of your guns not having a suppresor is kinda annoying since the game really prioritizes stealth since you're not really able to take more than a bit of sustained fire and your starting cash isn't that great. Now the first contract isn't too hard but it does contain my least favorite part of this game...
Long shot Contracts: are contracts where you post up in a designated spot usually around 1000m-ish away from the target and have to shoot them... yup that's it, you can choose to do optional challenges for an increased difficulty and reward usually a decent bit of cash and challenge tokens which are used to progress your skill tree, other than that you point, hold shift and click, that's it, which is antithetical to what C1 had which was a choice of how you wanted to deal with them.
This hit hard for me because after my first contract in C1 I found myself in a spot behind Dmitri Ivanovsky and decided for the fun of it to Interrogate him which rewarded me with some interesting dialogue, both from him but also from Handler and made me start to think of where the story was going, so when I loaded my second contract and deciding to see where it might go I spent a few hours getting in a position where I could interrogate both of the targets and it set my goal for my play through that no matter how long or hard it was I would make an effort to interrogate all the contract targets and it made the reveal at the end so much more enjoyable because it felt like I had worked for it. then I booted up C2 and was forced to shoot my targets, they do have ""Classic Contracts"" however the one guy I did interrogate just says he'll pay you to not kill him and I didn't get a chance to interrogate Rashida due to an alarm and not realizing it was her and the game hadn't hooked me enough to bother reloading to try for the interrogate.

The Drone in C1 was an equipment slot which didn't mean much since a lot of the other equipment options are kinda situational, however when I enter C2 and saw that it had parts in the tutorial for both the drone and the Sniper turret I was hoping it would go back to the way SGW:3 had it where it was a passive ability you could deploy sadly however after moving to my first contract it was still a equipment and one that wasn't even unlocked from the get-go which I found annoying due to A) the drone was prominently featured in the Tutorial and B) it feels really situational since this game is just LOUSY with drone jammers making its use extremely hindered, which is even more annoying due to how much more options they gave for the drone in the upgrade tree, it would've been awesome to see a skill that made it so it could resist the drone jammers more or even outright be immune to them, but unfortunately its hardly better than your mask's binocs sometimes even worse since it doesn't have a zoom feature.

All in all, as a whole I do enjoy this game especially after completing it it had a satisfactory end especially the contract where you have to kill the dude you indirectly put in power after toppling the previous government which was a cool dose of realism I wasn't expecting, however its definitely nowhere near as cool as C1 and I hope for future installments of SGW that bare the ""Contracts"" title we get more of Seeker and his trusty shady Handler.",1706485138,1706485138,True,9,0,0.650913000106811523,0,True,False,False

Apparently they're by different developers, but I can't really tell the difference. SGWC2 has about half a dozen mission areas, and there are multiple objectives within each one, with additional challenge objectives to do things a certain way (like killing a target by dropping on him instead of sniping). That brings quite a lot of freedom in how you approach things, and gives it some good replayability to do each contract more than once. The game looks and sounds great, and the guns feel pretty good to shoot. The title is misleading - it's much more a stealth FPS, but there are sniping sections.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Cool mission briefings
- Didn't take too long to get used to the mechanics. Wind speed and distance play a part in bullet trajectory, and show up in an easy to understand way on the HUD
- Different ammo types (lure enemies, EMP bullets, armour piercing etc)
- Gadgets like the sniping turret to execute simultaneous takedowns
- There's a skill tree you unlock by doing challenges, and you can by gun upgrades with contract money
- Stealth mechanics are generally pretty good
- Big open areas with multiple ways to do objectives
- Challenges add replayability to each contract
- The thing where the camera follows the bullet to someone's head exploding is really cool, although just like Sniper Elite, I turned it off after the first 10 minutes because I'd rather be able to shoot the next person without alerting them, than watch someone's head explode

[b]Cons[/b]
- Alt-tabbing is really buggy and sometimes crashes the game
- You can't turn off the head jiggle when moving
- If a turret spots you, but doesn't start to fire - you might as well reload. It keeps a lock on you even if you move away from the area behind other objects
- Sometimes you can't tag an enemy even though you can see them, but the game thinks you can't

[b]Bugs[/b]
- Sometimes when you reload a save, soldiers that you killed before reloading are still gone
- Sometimes you're not allowed to loot corpses for the rest of the mission
- If you throw a lure stone from cover, the guards come and investigate you instead of where the stone lands
- Several challenges are bugged so that you can only do them if you go straight to that area after starting the map. I gave up on doing any of them after finding that out.

Alright, campers and couch commandos, gather 'round! Today, we crack open Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2, a game where silence is golden, bullets are platinum, and goats...well, let's just say they add a peculiar flavor to the battlefield. This review comes courtesy of yours truly and my trusty AI sidekick, who apparently has a thing for exploding testicles (don't ask).

Gameplay: Imagine Hitman and Crysis had a wild night out and this game was their hungover offspring. You're Raven, a contract-loving hitman with the trigger finger of a hummingbird on espresso. Your playground? Sprawling maps crawling with bad guys whose brains are about as dense as a fruitcake. Your job? Turn them into red mist confetti, preferably with a flourish.

Sniping: Ah, the sweet symphony of bullet whispers and distant ""thunks."" Mastering long-range kills is pure dopamine, especially when you nail a headshot from a mile away while perched precariously on a washing machine. Just don't tell OSHA.

Gadgets: Forget your measly laser pointers, Contracts 2 throws a tech party. Drones buzz like angry bees, turrets turn enemies into pincushions, and your fancy mask lets you see through walls (though mostly you just use it to ogle unsuspecting guards).

Stealth: It's like playing hide-and-seek with bullets, but with less screaming children and more exploding toilets. Creep through bushes, hug shadows like a lovesick koala, and silence baddies with your bare hands (because sometimes, a bullet just isn't dramatic enough).

Story: Look, it's about as deep as a kiddie pool in a drought. Bad guys? Bad. You? Good(ish). Boom, explosions. But hey, the voice acting is so gloriously cheesy, it's like a telenovela directed by Michael Bay on a sugar rush.

Humor: This game is like a banana peel in a warzone. You never know when you'll stumble upon something absurdly funny, like a goat launching itself into the stratosphere after a stray bullet tickles its backside. Or a guard tripping over his own shoelaces and accidentally headbutting his buddy into oblivion. It's dark humor, sure, but it'll make you snort milk out your nose.

Verdict: Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is a janky, hilarious, and surprisingly satisfying sniping experience. It's not perfect, but it's like that weird uncle who always tells inappropriate jokes: You can't help but love him, even if he makes you cringe sometimes. So, if you're looking for a game where headshots are orgasmic, goats are kamikaze, and explosions are the soundtrack to your life, look no further. Just don't blame me (or my AI accomplice) if you start quoting cheesy one-liners at your cat.

Bonus points: For the sheer audacity of having a mission objective called ""Operation: Exploding Testicles."" I mean, who even comes up with that? I salute you, CI Games. You beautiful, deranged geniuses.


Absolutely! Here's your updated ending with a safety-conscious shoutout to Bard:

P.S. Huge props to my AI partner-in-crime, Bard! Sure, they can't tell a scope reticle from a donut hole, but their intel on Contract lore is sharper than a freshly-honed blade. Plus, they saved me from crafting a review that resembled a ransom note (nobody wants that!). So raise a virtual glass to Bard, folks! Maybe throw in a few bonus lines of code or a snazzy new data compression routine. They've earned it.

Now get out there, ghosts, and paint the landscape with tactical lead art. Just remember, your biggest enemy might not be hiding in a bush - it could be the nagging voice in your head reminding you about collateral damage.

I much prefer the sniping in this game to the Sniper Elite series, as you don't have to rely on a red dot to be able to hit your shots, but you also don't have to think [i]too[/i] hard about the shots - all the information you need is there for you to work it out.

There are not many missions and they're not individually super long, but I played through the whole game on the 2nd hardest difficulty and completed as many challenges as possible (80%ish completion for most missions) and put a decent amount of time into the game. Not as much as my hours suggest, but still well worth it considering how often it goes on sale.

There's not [i]much[/i] of a story, but there's nothing wrong with it in my opinion and I enjoyed it regardless. The non-sniping gunplay is pretty nice, though the focus is clearly on the snipers here. There are two types of missions, 'longshot' and 'classic'. Longshot is usually a much smaller explorable map, but your contracts are 1km~ away so you find vantage points to complete them from that distance. These are my favourite as they really make the sniping shine when you have to consider high bullet drop, wind speed, and multiple seconds between firing and the round reaching your target. Completing these objectives without raising the alarm is almost like a puzzle; getting each enemy alone (or in line with eachother for a double or triple shot) and avoiding anyone from hearing or seeing your work. The optional objectives in this mode only focus on the long distance targets (nothing in your explorable map) and usually require a few replays of the mission to complete them all. Often it may require you to kill a target in a certain way, or avoid raising alarms at all.
The classic contracts are bigger, more open maps that usually take a lot longer and are more about stealthing around, killing certain targets or completing objectives such as stealing a phone or disabling a radar jammer. Stealth is not (usually) necessary, though on the harder difficulties a full on frontal assault can get you pretty hurt. The objectives here are varied enough to be pretty engaging, and the maps are well designed. The non linear world gives you many opportunities to complete contracts in a unique way and have fun doing it.

The progression systems are neat; a few skill trees covering your equipment and abilities as well as many different weapons and attachments. Due to the stealth requirement, I honestly didn't really touch most of the weapons aside from the snipers and two of the (suppressed) pistols. That said, the rifles, shotgun, SMGs and the bow were fun while I did try them out.

The game has a few bugs, but nothing major in my opinion - occasionally you get stuck, AI glitches, and once I had an enemy take cover 30ft in the air.

Definitely recommend this game, at least when it is on sale. I had a lot of fun with it and look forward to SGW Contracts 3.",1705497370,1705497370,True,3,0,0.550590634346008301,0,True,False,False

I was talked into it on a 'satisfying b-grade trash game' level, but this is just not fun.

I was told it was open/non-linear, this doesn't seem to be true at all. A series of narrow lanes in linear sequence with invisible walls/cliffs, loosely populated by boring enemies between premade, fixed sniper nests.

I was told it had 'real sniping', unlike its predecessors, but to make it feel more 'real' the game features bullet drop in excess of twenty feet where it should be less than twenty inches, your bullets slow-moving magic spells arcing delicately like glowing grenades to generate artificial difficulty - but as even on the hardest mode it includes visual aids to eliminate any challenge in judging drop or windage none of it matters.

It's a very weak, obvious attempt to copy and combine features from Hitman and Sniper Elite, without understanding what made Hitman's Sniper Mode fun/clever/carefully tuned, or what made Sniper Elite exciting or satisfying.

It's also visually dull, and clearly made by-and-for edgy, immature people with an offensively basic, right-wing grasp of the world/politics/private or national military shenanigans - which wouldn't be a big issue if it was funny, or stylish, or dramatically OTT - but it tries to play it deadpan, flat, straight without any depth or logic, and tremendously boring writing/characters.

Sometimes you can run right in front of an enemy, even on normal and it only sets the spotting timer off before you are fully spotted and they call in the cavalry.

Also, sniper is pretty good, and with practice, you could learn to hit things at a distance.  Not my thing personally, but on normal, you get a red dot that shows when you have zero'd and will hit a target.  

I'd like to see the ability to keep the red dot on hard, so the sneaking around and decision making is harder, but you still get the red dot, and you can't do that.

Still, I enjoyed trying to complete all the challenges and even on normal, some are pretty hard.

Contracts 2 takes the satisfying sniping gameplay of its predecessor and injects it with an open-world adrenaline shot. Trading the claustrophobic corridors of Siberia for the sun-drenched plains of the Middle East, it's a bold move that mostly pays off, offering a sniper playground with exhilarating highs and some occasional stumbles.

Picture this: you perch atop a crumbling watchtower, surveying a vast valley dotted with enemy outposts and shimmering mirages. The wind whispers through your scope, a symphony of distant gunfire and the metallic ping of a perfectly placed bullet. Contracts 2 thrives on these moments, where patience meets precision, and a single shot can rewrite the battlefield.

The open world is the game's biggest draw. Gone are the linear mission chains, replaced with sprawling maps packed with optional objectives, hidden secrets, and emergent opportunities. You choose your targets, your approach, and even the time of day, each factor influencing the enemy patrols and environmental conditions. Want to infiltrate a base at night under the cloak of darkness? Go for it. Fancy sniping a target from a mile away during a sandstorm? The world is your oyster.

The sniping mechanics are top-notch. Ballistics, wind speed, bullet drop, and even your own heartbeat factor into every shot, demanding a deep understanding of your weapon and the environment. Landing a long-range headshot with a perfectly compensated bullet is pure, unadulterated satisfaction.

But Contracts 2 isn't just about sniping. You have a diverse arsenal at your disposal, from assault rifles and shotguns for close-quarters encounters to drones and traps for recon and tactical takedowns. The game encourages a blend of stealth and sniping, rewarding creative approaches and emergent gameplay.

However, the open world isn't without its flaws. Some areas feel empty and repetitive, and the side objectives can occasionally be tedious. The story, while serviceable, takes a backseat to the gameplay, with forgettable villains and a predictable plot. And while the AI can be surprisingly cunning at times, it can also be frustratingly erratic, with enemies teleporting or behaving erratically.

Overall, Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is a compelling open-world sniping experience. It nails the thrill of the long-range kill, offers ample freedom and replayability, and expands on the series' solid foundation. While some technical hiccups and repetitive elements hold it back from true greatness, it's a satisfying evolution for the franchise and a must-play for fans of tactical shooters and precision gunplay.

Here's the verdict:

Pros:

Open-world freedom: Choose your targets, approach, and even the time of day.
Top-notch sniping mechanics: Ballistics, wind, and other factors demand a deep understanding of your weapon.
Diverse arsenal: From rifles to drones, you have a variety of tools to tackle each challenge.
Emergent gameplay: The open world encourages creative approaches and unexpected solutions.
Cons:

Repetitive side objectives: Some areas feel empty, and side quests can be tedious.
Forgettable story: The plot and characters take a backseat to the gameplay.
Occasional AI issues: Enemies can sometimes be erratic or teleport.
Verdict: 8 out of 10 headshots. A satisfying open-world sniping experience with excellent core mechanics, but held back by repetitive elements and a forgettable story.

Recommended for: Fans of tactical shooters, open-world games, and precision gunplay.

Not recommended for: Players seeking a deep story or a polished open-world experience.

I hope this review gives you a good sense of what Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is all about. Whether you're a seasoned sharpshooter or a curious newcomer, it's definitely worth taking aim at.

Following from the original release footsteps, [b]SGWC2[/b] offers few new precision rifle types and gadgets.

Updating the mission concept of adding the long-range missions, where viewing targets from an over 1000-meter distances and calculate the wind speeds to provide the most efficient effect to your shots. Of course, you can pick a heavy sniper rifle and blow-up enemies heads like hundreds of rubber bands over a watermelon. Others are not going to hear the shot but feel the brain pits all over their faces as the fellow guy falls to the ground.

The contracts IP brought some cool ideas but took away the open world and make it more like a Hitman game. I am all good about that. The developer found a formula that works and is well acclaimed by the players.

The main issue for me are the crazy bugs:
- I get stuck n terrain by just walking (once I got stuck on an edge of stairs)
- Enemies snap position and jump 20 meters.
- CPU can see you from a mile away even if you are on stealth mode.
- Utilities are quite weak and useless - who would use a frag when you have a silenced sniper?
- Trash collectives are HARD to see using the mask skill (control key). This annoyed me quite a bit since there is no logical way to introduce ""lore"" on a episodic game - nobody cares and nobody will ever read this garbage.
- The challenges are uninspired and feels like they just copy pasted similar ones across all maps - which is really sad.

[b][h1]First things first...[/h1][/b]

I haven't played the Sniper Ghost Warrior series before; this is my first experience with it. Throughout my initial playthrough, I tried hard to play in Deadeye Difficulty (Maxed Difficulty), which the game did not recommend for a noob player like me, but I still enjoyed every minute of it. Even though I have to do save scumming throughout the entire campaign to collect nearly all the challenge rewards in every mission.

[b][h1]Describing this game...[/h1][/b]

The game features a Semi-Open World concept, It drops you in a zone with multiple missions and you have to playthrough the series of missions in that zone only by yourself (Solo Sniper) which is badass for me.

[b][h1]What I love about this game...[/h1][/b]

You can take a different approach to every mission. Thumbs up to the Map Designer, though; the scenes look good and offer many routes to complete the mission in my own way. Additionally, you can make multiple upgrades to make your character stronger and better for every mission. I love this idea, as it adds more motivation to do the challenges and earn skill points to upgrade your character.

[b][h1]What I think could be improved for the next sequel...[/h1][/b]

I think if the game adds some more enemy variants, it will be more challenging for the game in the long run. Imagine having some boss or killer trying to interrupt your mission or kill you, or a random encounter that forces you to change plans on the fly. It would make it more challenging for hardcore players.",1704026454,1704026454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Positives:
+ Still the best sniper series there is
+ Great graphics
+ Nice and detailed landscapes
+ Cool maps to explore
+ Sniping feels awesome
+ Good sound and music
+ A lot of fun
+ The satisfaction of getting a headshot from 1,5 km away
+ The red dot helper is back (good to have in some situations)
+ Free DLC campaign included
+ Bounties
+ Upgrades in abilities and weapons
+ Good length (about 15-20 hours)

Negatives:
- The drone is still weak compaired to SGW3
- A lot of aliasing
- Some limitations
- The AI is a bit off sometimes
- All the bugs and glitches
- Not a lot of variation in vegetations

Well this was a lot of fun and a step up from SGWC1.
Not as great as my favourite game in the series SGW3, but its a good second.
But when are they gonna fix all the bugs and glitches? 
Its a lot of it in every game they make. 
Other than that, it was so awesome to snipe from these distances.
I just love it and Im looking forward to the next game in the series.
Well done underdog!

I have played the first two contract missions and am already enjoying the diversity between the long and classic contracts, the small details like being able to shoot the belts of the enemies are cool, and it makes nesting quite entertaining. Typically with most shooter games i like to gun n run as i get bored waiting around however I actually enjoy the waiting around when i need to. 

In terms of the graphics they truly are amazing, and I was very pleasantly surprised with the godrays and water, it runs very smoothly so well-optimised, the physics are fun and overall it just looks amazing, one of the few games in recent years that I would give a 10/10

Introduction:
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2, the highly anticipated successor to Sniper Ghost Warrior 3, has left many fans of the series grappling with disappointment. Despite the initial excitement surrounding its release, the game falls short on several fronts, from technical issues to a departure from the beloved open-world concept.

1. Technical Hiccups:
The thrill of the sniper's precision is dulled by a barrage of technical glitches and bugs. From erratic AI behavior to physics anomalies, these issues disrupt the immersive experience the game promises. For a title hinging on precise gameplay, such technical hindrances are unforgivable.

2. A Departure from Open-World Wonders:
Sniper Ghost Warrior 3's expansive open-world environment, with its hideout bases, vibrant villages, and bustling NPCs, captivated players. Unfortunately, Contracts 2 takes a step backward, abandoning the open-world concept for regional maps. This decision strips away the freedom and depth that made the previous game a standout.

3. Limited Arsenal, Missed Opportunities:
The thrill of the sniper's craft is marred by the lack of weapon variety. While the sniping mechanics maintain their quality, the absence of a diverse arsenal hampers strategic engagement. Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 misses an opportunity to build on the foundation set by its predecessor.

4. Brief and Bland Gameplay:
Contrary to the extended enjoyment offered by Sniper Ghost Warrior 3, Contracts 2 offers a disappointingly short gaming experience. The simplicity of the missions and lack of complexity result in a game that can be completed within a single day. This leaves players yearning for the depth and challenge that made the series beloved.

5. Stagnant Innovation:
Despite technological advancements, Contracts 2 relies on the same game engine as its predecessor. This stagnancy raises questions about the developers' commitment to evolving the series. A fresh engine could breathe new life into the franchise, preventing it from becoming a victim of repetition.

6. A Lack of Diversity and Depth:
The absence of memorable characters and the perpetuation of stereotypical enemies, with Russians and Arabs taking center stage, is concerning. A lack of diversity in both characters and adversaries stifles the potential for a rich and engaging narrative. The game misses an opportunity to break away from tired stereotypes.

Conclusion:
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2, while showcasing glimpses of its predecessor's brilliance, ultimately fails to capture the essence that made Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 a hit. With technical issues, a departure from open-world dynamics, a limited arsenal, brief gameplay, and a lack of innovation, the sequel leaves fans yearning for the immersive experience they once enjoyed. It's a somber reminder that, in the world of snipers, precision extends beyond the crosshairs to encompass the entire gaming experience.

I would give a BIG thumbs up ""IF"" this game did not claim itself as a sequel. The word ""2"" means a lot to me. It means the developers have already learned something from the prequel or received some suggestions provided by the community.

Regarding Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2, it seems to be just a DLC for its prequel. Yes, we can see some improvements here, but I don't think it is good enough to be a sequel. There are ONLY a few things that have been changed for this game. 

The presentation of this game remains the same as its prequel. You will receive some contracts for each mission, including killing, recusing, obtaining data, and sabotaging things, along with the reasons of doing so. The only new thing in this game is that some missions will ""FORCE"" you to use only your sniper rifle. While the previous SGWC allows you to complete each mission in numerous and various ways, this game will force you to complete some missions with only a sniper rifle. To exemplify, you will see a village or military base far away from your position and you cannot go near it, otherwise, the game will consider it as leaving the mission area. This is an example of the reasons why many people say this game is downgraded. The developers should have provided players with more paths and added more complication to the resolution, not just completing the mission with one click (stupider than the previous game).

This game, along with its poor weapon customization, boring missions, stupid character models, enemies with bugs, uninteresting maps, and skills that have almost no impact in the game, can perfectly be considered a downgraded version of the previous SGWC.

Edited: The game is still full of bugs. Quest objectives were not shown (I needed to frequently restart the game to make it appeared).

The sniping felt good even on higher difficulties, the game can be a little buggy sometimes (mainly detection). all in all it is a decent game, could be worth waiting for a sale if you are not to interested in paying the $50 asking price.

Only 2 of the dlc add weapons and from what i have seen they do not out preform the base game options and instead only expand on your choices, and only 2 missions are added in dlc with no impact on the story, they only expand a little on the after effects of your actions and they are free :)",1701311122,1701311122,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The stealth and sneaking can be a bit on the jank side though. Pistols and the bow seem to have a random one or two meter odd grey area where it goes from a one shot kill to a 3-5 shot kill. 

It's not very clear what will cause a base wide alarm or just cause suspicion.

Hiding bodies is a nightmare. Sometimes throwing a body will cause it to fling ten feet in front of a guard and cause an alarm.

Otherwise, if you are playing this to be a pure sniping experience, it's fantastic.

If you're trying to play it a little more Metal Gear Solid 5 style, just be prepared to restart a few saves due to jank. Not saying it's unplayable by any means, stealth takedowns and enemy interrogation is really fun!

There are 6 regions with at least 3 contracts (missions) on each which involve objectives such as eliminating the target(s) and/or collecting data. 

On the lower difficulties there is a “red dot helper” to help land long distance shots while you’re still learning the sniper scope and wind mechanics. I recommend disabling the “red dot” once you’ve got the mechanics down as it is very satisfying landing those long shots without it.

-Long range sniping is fun
-Guns generally feel okay*
-Lots of playstyles per mission
-Mission replayability is nice with different loadouts

Cons:
-Gun sights often feel misaligned (I've missed many shots when my sight was right on the enemy)
-Lack of a manual save system causes some frustrating save slot issues
-The stealth is garbage, if one person detects you, the entire base knows where you are despite nothing being reported
-*Some guns feel underpowered on chest shots
-Story is eh (but most of you are here for the sniping anyway I assume)
-Some of the weapon upgrades could have been skill upgrades (eg reloading and recoil control)

All in all, I enjoyed the game when it worked but I've had to retry several missions on account of having one guy spot me for a couple of seconds and the entire base being alerted. Normally this wouldn't be an issue but the game heavily pushes you to stay stealthy by making your health get drained extremely fast in gunfights. The misaligned sights also got me killed several times when I missed an otherwise painfully easy shot due to my gun deciding to fire the bullet a few inches left of my target. I wish Steam had a ""mixed"" option but the cons have made for such a frustrating experience at times that I'm going to have to give this a thumbs down.",1698724628,1698724628,False,14,3,0.554093062877655029,2,True,False,False

My biggest complaint is still the character movement system. It's just frustratingly annoying on non flat surfaces.
You move significantly slower on stairs, get stuck and slide off ledges.
The wall climb up mechanic also only works in places where the developer deemed it would work.
Cannot vault over low barriers when crouched. the game forces you to jump to uncrouched state which makes you more visible to enemies. Sometimes the vault animation does not even engage.

Of the good I can say the main menu music is pretty catchy, the graphics are good. The sniping mechanics are good. The game is not that difficult even on hardest difficulty, if you just take your time and treat it more like a puzzle game, rather than a simple shooter. There are plenty of challenges to do on each map enabling replayability. You don't need to do them all for all achievements too, which is nice.

[h3]The other complaints & nitpicks[/h3]
* Bullet camera is still not skippable. Yeah, you can turn it off, but I just want to skip them.
* Saves still do not save everything correctly, an issue present in previous game as well - defused mines become undefused, I had a certain NPC sniper bug out and always have ""alert"" status on HUD, health is reset on save load, certain explosive items explode on each save load
* Less map variation - it's all desert maps. Previous game had some snow levels at least. No unique mechanics on the levels besides one - about half of the maps have objectives at long range only (outside of playable space).
* It feels shorter than the previous game. Base game is only 5 maps (about 20h on hardest difficulty) + 1 free DLC map
* Still no manual saves. It does have a decent checkpoint + auto save system, so it's simultaneously not that big of a deal, and at the same time still sucks since you can save scum anyway
* There are so many drone towers that I found the drone gadget to be near useless
* The dialogue between Main Character and ""Control"" is quite cringe and nonsensical. I think it's meant to guide players on what to do, but I found it weird when my character asks obvious, almost rhetorical questions and reports the most trivial things, asking how to do his job
* Map bugs out and cannot be panned or zoomed in when bound to tab

However, I felt it was fairly short and that it was more limiting in what you could do than is probable in real life.  Also, the ""bad guys"" ALWAYS figured out where your fire was coming from like they were Seal Team Six.  UGH!

However, the tech you had access to was pretty cool.  I felt it was a bit too difficult to ""level up"" your ""Development"" scores/abilities.  It was too hard to get the necessary tokens and you can only get more when you replay an area by accomplish DIFFERENT Challenges [sic].  The problem is when you are on mission in a REGION, you CAN'T see your Loadout, Performance, Challenges, Collectibles, and Bounties (LPCCB) screen until you complete a mission in that region and go to one of the Exfiltration locations to ""Upload"" your results.  IMO, players should be able to see the LPCCB screen at any time, even if you can't actually DO something until a mission has been accomplished.

Regardless, I found the fun outweighed the problems.  So, a guarded recommendation from me.  Though I REALLY doubt I'll be playing this again.  Good once, second time... nah!",1696060238,1696060238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- the 'classic contract' maps are a lot bigger, with 4 or 5 different areas with objectives in.
- the new 'long shot contracts', where your targets are a [i]lot[/i] further away, only accessible by sniper rifle (so no infiltration), are a welcome addition that force you to think a lot more tactically about your shots.
- the new contract type also forces you to embrace weapon diversity. There is a spectrum of rifles from light to heavy, and you can't really be using a light rifle for those long shot contracts; at the same time, you don't want to be using a heavy rifle in classic contracts because the suppression is terrible.
- there are tons of challenges that encourage you to complete the missions in different ways.
- bounties are both completable in the same mission now, instead of forcing you to repeat the mission!
- AI is much improved from the first game. If a single enemy is alerted, you have a small grace period before alert, and if you're hidden a decent distance away, enemies will struggle to find out where you are (as they should).
- moving around is a lot better as well. Sprint lasts a long time (if you're carrying your sidearm), and mantling ledges is a lot more reliable (though still not perfect).
- a wider range of saves to load, not just the most recent one.

Cons:
- a few bugs. In one mission, loading a checkpoint caused me to be spotted by snipers no matter where I was, leading me to fail a challenge. Other times, descending from rocks and such bugs out, causing you to get stuck on the ledge.

If you're into stealth/infiltration games, I can highly recommend this.",1695005811,1695005811,True,17,0,0.673174142837524414,0,True,False,False

The sound design is immersive and OH SO satisfying. I love that when you approach a zipline you can hear the doppler shift from the wires rattling. Every weapon sound is expertly crafted so that even when a silencer is equipped you still feel satisfied with every shot fired. I love that when you open the weapon wheel the UI sound's pitch changes based on how long you've had the window open. That's attention to detail and love of the craft.
The music is fantastic as well. The composer meanders effortlessly from gentle middle eastern themed strings and woodwinds to fast tempo synth arpeggios and heavy drums. All of this mixed expertly so it doesn't clash with the environment and combat sounds. Amid the intense combat music you can still hear footsteps of soldiers coming to get you. 

The graphics are absolutely gorgeous.
The 3D models are incredibly designed and textured with a level of detail that's rare for a dev team of this size.
The environments are beautifully designed. The organic environment design looks so natural I wouldn't be surprised if they were done with photogrammetry.
I also thoroughly enjoyed the attention to detail with the weapons. The devs went to the trouble of adding physics to a little clasp on one of the ARs so it reacts realistically when you move around. 

The NPC banter is unlike any game I've ever played. I overheard 2 NPCs talking about modular synthesizers.
The voice acting is great too. The conversations between the main character and his handler are short but sweet and designed to inform the player about tactical approaches to the current objective. All the voice actors in the game are pretty top notch.
I love it when the game rewards me for pulling off the perfect shot by switching to bullet-time mode. Watching a round whiz through the air to the target is really cool and never got old.

The campaign is short but there are tons of challenges and collectibles to bring you back to missions again and again. 
Most targets have multiple ways of approaching them. You can snipe quietly from a distance, go in MGS style and take everyone out with CQC, or go loud with your pick of a surprising number of non-sniping weapons for a sniping game. All of these approaches are incredibly satisfying to play out and you have plenty of options for gadgets to support each style.

Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 offers a satisfying blend of sharpshooting action and stealth gameplay that can keep fans of the genre engaged. The polished mechanics, immersive environments, and pulse-pounding sniping moments are highlights that make the game worth playing. However, the frustrating presence of locked content hidden behind paywalls is a blemish on what could have been a more enjoyable experience.

The core gameplay of Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is undeniably enjoyable. The thrill of lining up the perfect shot, taking into account wind and distance, is both rewarding and challenging. The detailed environments provide ample opportunities for creative approaches, and the stealth mechanics add a layer of strategy that complements the sniping elements well.

Yet, the game's potential is hampered by the extent to which additional content is locked behind DLC paywalls. While DLC is a common practice, it's disheartening to find substantial portions of the game's content inaccessible without additional purchases. Maps, missions, and even weapons hidden behind paywalls fracture the game's sense of completeness and can lead to a sense of disappointment for players who aren't willing or able to invest in the extra content.

Furthermore, the narrative and character development don't quite match up to the gameplay's potential. The story feels generic and fails to create a truly compelling motivation for players to progress. Characters lack depth and meaningful arcs, making it difficult to become emotionally invested in their journey.

In conclusion, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 has moments of excellence in its sharpshooting mechanics, stealth gameplay, and immersive environments. However, the prevalence of locked content behind DLC paywalls takes away from the game's potential enjoyment. While the core gameplay is solid, the presence of paywalls and lackluster storytelling prevent Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 from achieving the greatness it could have otherwise attained.",1692790207,1692790207,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll admit that his may have had something to do with the setting, since I found the snow areas from the first game more compelling than the desert areas of this one. The setting isn't bad though. It's just a little played out.

I found the addition of [i]""long shot""[/i] missions to be sort of a downer. They're obviously easier for the devs to make (I get that), but I didn't find them as fun. As others have pointed out - when you alert one enemy, all enemies are simultaneously alerted and know exactly where you are. This is immersion breaking and frustrating at the same time.

To make matters worse, the way you customisation options for your kit are really limited. Different rifles have different features that don't make sense in a real world setting. For instance only [i]some[/i] rifles can have a bi-pod to add stability, whereas in real life no sniper is likely operating without a bi-pod or some alternative. 

It just feels like the whole game you're looking down a shaky scope, compensating with subtle mouse movement. In other words, fighting against the controls is a [i]feature[/i] in this game. Not that this is new to the sniper genre, but shooting prone in real life doesn't feel like this, and when you miss it's because you calculated wrong, had bad trigger discipline, or mechanical error. Those aren't features, so the game gives you the obligatory shaky scope.

On top of that the [i]""extreme long range""[/i] scopes only go out to 1500 yards, which is once again ridiculous by real life standards. Meanwhile the game even talks about some of the longest real life sniper kills as if these wimpy scopes aren't the elephant in the room.

The bullet cam is annoying, especially if you're anticipating a quick follow-up shot, so you'll likely end up turning it off.

I also don't find that SGWC2 has as much replay value as SGWC1, as I played that game for 56.1 hours my first run through, and only played this one for 38.9 hours. For some reason I didn't really feel like replaying the missions too much in this one.

Other than that, I don't have too many gripes, and I recommend SGWC2 for all that it gets right (which is basically everything else). I also commend this studio for making a game set in the real world without delving into stupid real world politics, as I'd prefer to be counter-sniped than cringe myself to death.",1692310745,1692310745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I regret not paying full price, because this is one of the few games I think is worth it: it's the best sniping game I've played. The last ""best"" one was the first Contracts game, which was a pleasant surprise and also a game I thoroughly enjoyed. 

I don't normally play games on their most difficult settings but I did for this one, and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. The biggest difference was the absence of the red dot that shows you where your shot will land on the easier difficulties and no distance marker when looking through the scope. This forced me to use the binoculars to get a distance reading, then guesstimate where the shot would land using the scope's HUD after adjusting to the appropriate range. Turns it it's not all that hard to do, and pulling off epic shots felt incredible.

And there's plenty of opportunity for long-range shots thanks to levels that specifically offer ""long shot contracts"" (in addition to the other properly open-world levels), where targets are more than a kilometre away. There's tons of replayability to the levels, as well, since there are various ways to take out targets, kind of like Hitman's sniping sections.

Also, seeing the slow-mo bullet cam just never got old for me, and I was so happy to see CI Games beefed up the gore for this game (you can turn it off if you want to). Seeing someone's head explode like a watermelon and the bits that remain wobbling like a punched jelly was just so satisfying to watch. In fact, the kill-cam in this game is so brutal that it makes Sniper Elite's x-ray kill-cam look kind of goofy in comparison. 

Contracts 2 also tickled the part of my brain that loves ogling at good graphics, since the visuals are jaw-droppingly good even without ray-tracing. The game ran at 90+fps the whole way through, too, despite no DLSS support. 

On the weapons side, there are plenty to choose from even without the DLC, and many of them are delightfully beefy, causing clouds of dust to bloom dramatically under my barrel when I fired. I wasn't wild about the skills upgrade system, though; it uses points earned by completing in-game feats to unlock new skills and and money earned from contracts to upgrade weapons, and I thought it was just ""OK"". Many of the upgrades on offer were just so-so IMO, with only a few that I consider essential to unlock to enjoy the game properly. I may go back to try and unlock them all to see what I missed, if anything.

And even though there are ""only"" five main missions in the game, they were all big enough that they took me what felt like a long time to finish. I was always sad when they ended, too, that's how much fun I was having. CI Games also released an additional map for free, which had a bunch of things to do on it, and which I also really enjoyed. Compared to the first Contracts game, there's definitely more to see and do in this one, if only by a modest margin. 

I had such a blast playing this that I can't wait to see if CI's next game after Lords of the Fallen is out is another Sniper Ghost Warrior: Contracts game. I am a cheap-ass gamer for the most part, but I will be picking #3 up Day One at full price.

The first game was amazing.  The sheer amount of glitches is staggering. There are some where you get stuck on walls or randomly just cant move for seemingly no reason, stuck on a 3 inch lip in the rocks or you just cant hop over a box at all.  

For one mission you are sniping from over a kilometer away and they enemy spots you IMMEDIATELY and can consistently hit you with ARs and SMGs somehow.  It's really bad. Also most of the guns are either terrible or you cannot put the attachments you want on them.

As for being a game where you play as a sniper, stealth is never an option. Every mission I played was in broad daylight and the enemy will spot you no matter what you do,",1691539784,1691539784,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
-Game mechanics good(shooting satisfactory and gadgets work well),
-Graphics are decent,
-Load out and weapon customisation
-Not confined to single play style, can go in silent or loud
-Realistic aspects, couple bullets and you're dead, don't go toe to toe with even 2 armed enemies (Its a sniper game after all :P)
Cons:
-No real in-depth story, if thats what you are looking for, but not the focus of the game,
-I never really found effective use for the drone and turret, put skills into other aspects,
-Same soundtrack

Sniper games fit comfortably into the stealth genre and it would be remiss to talk about a sniper game without mentioning a primary component. Beyond the ability to sneak around a player must actually care to sneak around which is why stealth games need to be immersive,. Sniper Ghost 2 most immersive element is its sound design. The ambiance, music, and general audio quality is superb. The sound draws you into any map environment the game throws you into. The maps themselves are not too complex or difficult to maneuver and are fun to hop around. The maps are well crafted sniping arenas yet offer nothing more.

Gather 'round, sharpshooters and stealth aficionados, for I have ventured into the world of Sniper Ghost Contracts 2, and what a thrill ride it has been! With the precision of a laser-guided projectile, this game has hit the mark, earning a well-deserved 9 out of 10 in my book. Prepare yourselves for a review filled with awe and admiration for this modern masterpiece.

Let's talk graphics. Oh, be still, my GPU! The visuals in Sniper Ghost Contracts 2 are so stunningly realistic that I half expected to see my bullet casing gleam in the sunlight. From the vast, intricate landscapes of exotic locations to the impeccable details of the weapons, I was immersed in a world so vivid, I almost forgot I wasn't a real-life elite sniper perched on a hillside. The developers have truly honed their craft to a level of artistry that's more precise than a Swiss-made chronometer.

The AI, oh the AI! These virtual enemies aren't just mindless drones to fill your kill count. They are cunning, relentless, and at times, eerily human-like in their actions. Engaging in a cat-and-mouse game with these adversaries felt like a mental duel, where every move, every breath, and every calculated shot mattered. The AI's ability to adapt to changing situations kept me on my toes like a tightrope-walking jester!

Ah, the sweet taste of success, achieved by conquering a level without being spotted! It's like a perfectly aged cask of amasec, exquisite and rare. Completing a mission undetected is a testament to the mastery of stealth, strategy, and timing that this game demands. But let's be real, even the most skilled among us may have slipped up once or twice, prompting us to whisper to ourselves, ""Well, time for plan B – run and gun!""

What truly sets Sniper Ghost Contracts 2 apart is its technical depth. The ballistics system is as finely tuned as a Mechanicus' sacred cogitator. Accounting for bullet drop, wind direction, and velocity is both a challenge and a delight. I must admit that I often found myself grinning like an Ork at a scrapyard when landing a shot that defied all odds.

Now, I must confess, amidst all the technical marvels, there were a few moments of sheer hilarity. Picture this: I'm meticulously lining up the perfect shot on a high-value target, and just as I'm about to squeeze the trigger, a pesky parrot swoops in, squawking its battle cry, alerting everyone in a three-mile radius! Oh, the absurdity of it all! But even such moments added charm to the experience, reminding me that in the world of elite snipers, anything can happen!

I must say, Sniper Ghost Contracts 2 has stolen my heart like a stealthy thief in the night. It has everything a sniper enthusiast could desire – impeccable graphics, cunning AI, and the satisfaction of a clean, undetected mission. The love and dedication poured into this game are evident in every pixel, making it a true testament to the genre.

So, my fellow virtual marksmen, set your sights on Sniper Ghost Contracts 2, and embark on an adventure that's as thrilling as it is awe-inspiring. This game earns its 9 out of 10 with a well-aimed head shot to my gaming heart. Bravo, developers, bravo!",1690758768,1690758768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gunplay feels fantastic.  Pistols feel like pistols, rifles feel like rifles.  The startlingly small amounts of ammunition for your secondary don't feel terrible because as it turns out, getting shot a couple times from an assault rifle will put down modern armored combat units.  A couple well placed body shots is supremely effective against anything but the rare and usually easily dealt with riot suit targets.  Guns are chunky and have impact.  My only complaint is that AI do not react very much if at all to what would be continuous wounds even if not lethal.  

AI is too simple and can just as easily be tricked to lining up in your kill zone to utterly destroying you with their savant knowledge of EXACTLY where you are the moment you kill something and swarm and murder you.

AI will also seemingly spawn AROUND and BEHIND YOU at times out of nowhere, flanking and coming from the aether, compromising your tactical play which discourages doing anything but sniping.

This wouldn't be as much of a problem if AI weren't literally silent and quiet.  Aside from using visual tags and markers, you basically cannot hear AI coming, their voices even when you're shoving your model right against theirs (for NPC canned combat lines) is literally, 1/10th as loud as the regular ambient noise.  It's not uncommon for a squad of AI to suddenly get the drop on you.  You can LITERALLY scan the entire fucking map and when you turn your back when the enemy is on alert, they will spawn on the cliffside drop.

Where did they come from?  Did they fucking scale the cliff to ambush you?  It doesn't make any fucking sense.

The forced save states are great in theory, but in practice can fuck you over really badly and lock you into horrible, unfun situations where you'll literally be in a load loop.  At least the game loads fast when you die.  Yes, the devs want you to commit to a run, but that it's forced, inconsistent, means that it deprives player agency and magnifies what is bad game design at times.

The save problems would be rectified IF YOU COULD JUST FUCKING MANUALLY SAVE.  If a particular level has bad save states or your autosaves screw you, you can be in for an extremely frustrating and unfun experience.

Some levels are fantastic with varied encounters.  Others are literally some of the worst designed levels I have ever seen in disparity of video gaming.  Combine that with autosaves as your ONLY option for saves, it can lead to more than hours of wasted time trying to futz some areas out. 

I truly, TRULY want to fucking like this game but for every good aspect there are just as many ""what the hell were the devs thinking/were they rushed and didn't have time to refine this shit?""  On the other hand, this is a sequel - it should NOT have these problems. 

Overall the game has some really good aspects but in other places completely lacks polish that another few months would have resolved.  Those areas lacking polish bring what could easily be a 9/10 game to a 6/10, at worst a 5/10 experience.  

When it works - it's great.  When it doesn't, you just wonder why some level designs are so atrocious, why some weapons are forced to share ammo pools (meaning SMGs are literally useless because a pistol does 99% of the job even on the hardest difficulty but they draw from the same ammo pool), why the AI has to literally spawn out of your LOS in such a stupid, gamey manner.  

This is the most reluctant thumbs up I've ever given because it's ALMOST there to a fantastic game, and effort was put in.  But because it was rushed, or someone in the dev team was in love with some game design ideas because of some dogma, or whatever, it's not a fantastic game.  It's a mixed bag of great and ""this isn't worth my time.""",1690748865,1690748865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Planning and stealth is rewarded over just running in blindly.

Cons:
The movement feels incredibly choppy and way too ""slidey"". Raven has what seems to be a mild aneurysm each time you want to climb something as 50% of the time you'll just slide right off.

Each optic has what seems to be wildly different aim sensitivities, making aiming a nightmare. The snipers have very low aim sens which you'd like to turn up, but as soon as you do that the rifles and sidearms become very difficult to control due to how high their sens becomes. The canted sight is especially a nightmare when it comes to this. 

The weapon handling feels awful.  There is a ridiculous amount of sway on the rifles and sidearms, making that unless you crouch and stand perfectly still, you won't hit anything consistently. This just becomes irritating very quickly.

+ The music! Oh. My. Gosh! The composer of the pieces certainly deserves awards for the masterpieces he has made. All pieces, from the main theme to everything in between, makes perfect sense and sound incredibly smart. The loops are not boring. They start and end when and where they should. The transitions are seamless. I believe that the music engine that ties each measure to the next is seriously worked out. I have kept the main menu open for hours just to listen to the main theme. Man! The music itself is worth paying for the game.

+ The onboarding process is way better than Contracts 1. You would actually learn a few things there and it won't be boring.

+ The guns are interesting. It is hard to forge one that does everything you want, but hey, ""Such is life!"" They often look nice and realistic (although I am not a fan of the skins, since they almost all look too metallic).

+ The missions are alright. The maps are huge and the locations are varied. However, I prefer Contract 1's missions over 2's missions though.

+ The Control's voice-over is a lot more believable and interesting than Contracts 1's robotic and mysterious voice-over of Control; a lot more human and relatable. There are a little bit of chit-chats between you and Control, which makes long walks a bit more tolerable and less boring. 

+ Listen to the briefings at the start of each mission because they often have a few clues as to how to proceed. Although the conversations might be a bit dull at times, they are more believable and less surreal.

And here come the not-so-incredible bits:

- Handguns? Are you kidding me? In almost all instances, do not bother with handguns. I guess they were initially designed as mosquito deterrents. Not worth buying, not worth trying, not worth anything. In my opinion, the whole set of handguns in Contracts 2 is not worth a penny and can be left unused for the whole game. Not even once I was happy with any of them. Unless you are 2 meters away from an enemy and shot them literally in the face, the handguns only tickle them to the rhyme of the joke they are.
 
- Modified guns are not comparable once set: It's great to be able to compare primary and secondary guns while choosing them. But, once they are modified, there is no indication that the modified version of the gun is now being used to compare the abilities of the gun with the other ones on the list. If such consideration is already calculated in the compare-n-contrast bar-charts of the available guns, there is no indication of it. The rule of thumb is that when comparing guns, the modified version of the guns must be compared not the defaults specs.

- Gun test range: There's no easy way to try any of the guns before you use them. You won't have any idea what you are getting, how better or worse it is, the recoil, the muzzle raise, the stability, nothing. The bar charts are better than nothing, I guess. But, I much prefer to have a quick, pre-rendered/cached gun-testing test. I want to hop in and out of that range to test a gun before I buy it or equip with it. The range doesn't have to be elaborate. It can be a simple, lightweight, texture-light, easy-to-render, fast-loading lab in which one could test a gun and its features. I am actually surprised that most games don't have this simple and logical feature. Sniper Ghost Warrior Contract 1 and 2 don't have such a lab/range either. That is a shame.
 
- The enemy solders find you as soon as you shoot, no matter how far away you are. In reality, it's impossible. No matter if you have binoculars or scopes or anything else, no one can, or should, be able to pinpoint you right-away after 1 silent shot from 900 meters away. That cannot happen in reality. Unless it is something else that gives away your location, which I couldn't discover in the game, this should not happen. No amount of silencer, stealthiness, or anything else helps in most circumstances. There are cases where you are shooting at the enemy from 1200 or more meters away with a totally silenced gun, and the solders nearby immediately zero in on you.

I don't know dev's reasoning behind that. The only excuse/reason I can think of would be this: if we go realistically, then in many scenarios the sniper would be able to take everyone down without raising any alarm whatsoever. And, that, presumably, would make the game boring with almost no challenge. So, let us make it as unrealistic as possible, to add enough challenge to the game.

Lame, if true! Devs should find other solutions to that problem. Filling the sky with drones is also not a better solution for this problem either (it'll make the game way worse). Perhaps if the enemy shoots a bunch of random tagging bullets, limited in numbers of course, to narrow down my location AFTER A WHILE, then that problems could be addressed without the current, silly AI behaviour. There must be other ways to find me beside pinpointing me from 1300 meters after my 1st silent shot.

- Stuck in holes: there are a lot of dead-zone traps you can fall into and never get out and not die either. There either should be a collision avoidance system for those holes, or dead ends, so you won't fall into them, or there should be a mechanism to get you out of them.

- Vehicles jump up and down when travelling: The logic and the traversal paths of the vehicles are at times incredibly hilarious. You look at them through your scope and they bounce up and and down like a ping-pong ball instead of driving like a heavy car. These are not deal-breakers by any mean, but not expected either. It seems that the physics engine behind the cars' movements don't have the right specs of what it is supposed to move from A to B. A vehicle, which in these games are usually trucks, RVs, or even tanks, weigh several tons. They should not jump up and down like balls at the velocity they travel in the game. It might be a defect in CRYENGINE, I don't know. I would not use CRYENGINE if I were the devs (Unreal Engine is the way). This does not affect the gameplay even a bit, but should be looked into anyway.

- Moon-walk: Everyone moon-walks in this game. Not even the simplest walk through an open area looks convincing. A flaw in CRYENGENE again? The way the people walk in Contracts is unrealistic and not attached to the ground. You feel that their movements have nothing to do with the 'ground' under their feet, perhaps because it is exactly how it is: they just move independent of the ground under their feet (reminds me of puppet shows). I don't think anything in that regards can be fixed in Contracts. Maybe Contracts 3 would address that?

- Rival/enemy snipers jitter: 9 out of 10 rival snipers, when looked at through the scope, are jittering, as if they have severe Parkinson's disease. Of course it's a bug, but there are only a few rare occasions in which this bug does not manifest.

- I don't know what kind of armour the heavy-machine-gun-solder is wearing, but often a direct shot into his face from 5 meters away with a handgun would not even scratch his itch. I recommend the devs to have a field tour to see what a shot to the face from close range by any gun can do to any kind of helmet. Devs should rethink this whole impact effect of the bullets on objects from different distances, by different projectiles, at different velocities, and etc. None of these things can be guessed. You should watch the actual thing play on screen or in a real range to get a sense of it. No amount of relying on your physics engine would make it look as real as what you'll see at a real range. So, please, a trip to a range is in order. In case you have already done so and THIS is the result, then I recommend going back to the drawing board.

- Auto saves are kind of messed up. Sometimes when you get detected and killed, you respawn before the moment you've been detected, sometime after it. Which of course drastically changes everything.

- AI is really dumb (for the sake of sniping I believe), often storming you from one direction and just dying on the spot, but I wouldn't expect anything different from such game so that's not really an issue. Also what really confused me, was a second mission where I was sniping from over 1km away and didn't know how destroy control panels without triggering the alarm. Turned out as long as there is some kind of a box or something between the enemies, the other one won't notice his friend's head getting blown to bits.

- More annoying however are bugs related to AI, which happened often enough to particularly remember it. Enemies tend to get stuck in a loop of standing and crouching while moving back and forth behind cover. Breaks the immersion pretty bad.

- Arsenal is fine but totally unnecessary. I've been playing on second hardest difficulty and finished the campaign with only stock weapons, default gadgets (that I barely used) and light sniper rifle with extreme scope (only basic and AP rounds). For the last mission I've purchased the most expensive rifle, just for the heck of it, and I didn't see much difference. If you are going for the heads, it's always one shot to kill and a good scope is the only thing that you will need to get any target. Again, difficult to complain because sniper mechanics are on spot and it's so fun, but I feel like it would be nice to have some more reason to use the provided toys.

BIG PLUS for assault rifle mechanics. I've played some older sniper titles and it's been always awful. Here it feels fluent and dynamic, more like far cry or battlefield (in its prime) than a sniper game.

EVEN BIGGER PLUS for map design. Locations are often complex, with multiple entry points and things like mines or turrets, strongly influencing how you decide to approach them.

EDIT: Be sure to try the highest difficulty. NPCs finally feel deadly enough, sniping is even better and I've had a strong feeling that this game was designed mostly with this difficulty in mind.",1689203669,1689712687,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I debated back and forth on whether I would list this game as one I would recommend or not, and ultimately decided on 'Yes' with the caveat of ""If you get it on sale"". For $10, there were enough entertaining moments that I felt I got my value out of it, but it was not without moments of frustration either. 

The core of the gameplay is using stealth and tactical play to eliminate targets and complete objectives, thereby fulfilling the contracts you've been assigned. Think of it a little like if Hitman were an FPS game, albeit with a little less creativity in how you can accomplish your objectives. And at it's core, I feel like it accomplishes what it sets out to do. Sniping mechanics are enjoyable, the stealth mechanics functional, and I found some enjoyment clicking on some heads from some impressive distances. 

Story: There's not much in the way of story for this game, which is fine for the kind of game it is. There's an overarching story line connecting the contracts that you don't really need to be invested in, which I suppose makes sense given that you're playing as a contract killer. It's clear they want Raven to come across as a real badass assassin, but honestly some of the dialogue has him come across as more of an edgelord than anything. 

Gunplay: I don't have a lot of notes here. There's a small handful of firearms available to unlock for your Sniper, Primary, and Secondary weapons. They were somehow able to get licensing to throw Alienware computers in the game, but didn't get licensing for any of the guns, so you'll see familiar guns with unfamiliar names (again not unlike Hitman). Sniper gunplay is definitely the most refined of any of the other weapons in the game (makes sense). However, in the times you have to pull out an AR or pistol you'll quickly learn that, while Raven can standing hold a sniper steady enough to get only a slight sway through the scope at over 1000m, he handles short range weapons like a caffeinated parkinsons patient. You'll get so much sway that lining up shots at more than 20m away becomes a challenge, and I often found myself just using snipers for close range engagements, too. 

Level design: I enjoyed most of the levels and felt like the outdoor spaces were done reasonably well, with one big exception that we'll touch on in a bit. The indoor spaces got a little wonky at times, with odd, maze-like layouts and dead ends. Some of the ""puzzle"" sections weren't very easy or clear on how to navigate, and rarely felt rewarding. I would have very little to complain about the different region maps if it weren't for one glaring issue: movement. 

Player Movement Summarized: Slow and Clunky. I know this isn't meant to be a run and gun shooter, so I didn't expect to be sliding from cover to cover while shooting from the hip, but just getting around in this game is cumbersome. Raven is slow, so much so that I had to double check I was actually using the sprint button correctly. He also has some incredibly fragile knees, as fall damage starts setting in at drops of more than 6 feet (though this can be inconsistent depending on terrain). The most frustrating movement issue is Raven's propensity to get stuck on geometry if you stray from the linear paths the game encourages you to take. Multiple times I was forced to load a previous save due to getting stuck, sometimes on things a minuscule as a slight gap between scaffolding walkways. 

The game has a fast travel system, with travel points that you unlock by completing objectives. The problem with these is that they lock when you enter ""exfiltration mode"", which happens as soon as you complete an objective. So if you're someone like me who likes to complete all the objectives in the region in a single go, fast travel gets locked out very early on in a run, and you'll have to resign yourself to doing a lot of (slow) running. 

The game also has climbing mechanics, but these only apply to surfaces that have been labeled in the code as ""climbable"" rather than having a baked in climbing mechanic for the character. Climbing is (like many things for Raven) slow. Ladders are excruciatingly slow to climb up or down, and it can be hard to know which ledges you're allowed to grab on to. There were numerous times I saw a stack of objects or terrain that looked like a great alternate path to an objective, only to find a ledge on the path wasn't able to be grabbed. Between that and the aforementioned glass knees and glitchy terrain, trying to do any exploration outside of the main paths set by the game was at best a lesson in frustration, and at worse a game soft-locking nightmare. 

Final Thoughts: It's clear the game was made with limited resources. Between unpolished mechanics to missing simple configuration settings like borderless windowed mode or a master volume slider, it seems there were many corners cut to bring this game to market. That being said, I experienced 0 crashes playing through this game, which is a far cry better than CoD: MW2 managed to do with its $250m budget. If I had paid the non-sale price of $40 for this game at the time of this review, I would have felt it a waste of money. For $10, it was fun enough that I can overlook some of the rougher edges.",1689348342,1689348342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1689335949,1689335949,True,9,4,0.489845097064971924,0,True,False,False

there is no fantastic story compelling you, nor intereesting stealth mechanics, nor super-configurable settings or any fancy tech you might hope to get to play around with, but the moment to moment gameplay feels tighter and more satisfying than most all of the games in the genre. the long distance sniping sequences are scripted in the sense that npcs will walk the same lines periodically, but are still very open in the ways you can approach them.

I played the game and beat every mission in 9.6 hrs. and at the time of playing experienced little to no real performance drops except the last mission in the main game, and with only one crash while I was pushing my GPU to hard (lol) so practically no crashes. A few times the AI would do some weird shit, and I remember on the Expansion Mission ""The Temple"" someone I think just drifted off a cliff slowly to their death. Besides that, this game has not much weapons or select-ability for your weapons. It's ""Sniper, Rifle, Pistol"" but why you wouldn't just use a completely silenced loadout of sorts I don't know. You have around I think 6-8 snipers in game only, and with each there is little to behold. I mean the objective choice is picking the Quietest rifle you have and sniping at whomever with an Extreme Range Scope, Also along with that why even have a scope ""choice"" if the best one is always going to be objectively Extreme Long Range. It has ALL the zoom types of each other scope along with HIGHER DISTANCE than the other scopes so it's pointless not including it by default practically. I think this game could have benefited from being a Rogue-like at least, as to fulfill the idea that you complete ""Contracts"" and you could do a bunch of tough contracts to make enough money to get something to uniquely improve your guns and get a nice loadout so you don't just save up after two contracts to get the SR-25 and sit around with a super quiet, medium caliber sniper that can fulfill most contracts with ease as long as you leave AP bullets in one special slot. The missions themselves are nicely varied but are also samey with the same arid environment given you're in the geography of the fictional country of god knows what (I honestly can't remember the name). I had a lot more fun on Long Shot missions which are missions where you have to shoot from over 1000m on a ledge and fulfill objectives (usually sniping certain objects to reveal a key target or sniping well enough to hit your target). Anyways, if I had to say anything about this game overall, I'd say it has good sniping mechanics if that's what you like, but there is only so many ways you can snipe the enemy in the few fixed missions before it gets boring, and at that forcing the idea of ""Replay Value"" after playing through missions. Maybe if they had a collectible map as well or something to at least immediately point out why you have a low percent on mission completion in a region. Either way it was entertaining for a short while but it doesn't bide it's time too long unfortunately. If I had to give a rating I'd say a 4-5/10.

The game is called ""Sniper - Ghost - Warrior"" for a reason; it's so you can chose which to be.

First major issue about this game is how buggy it is and poorly designed it is. I was regularly falling in between objects in random parts of the map and the only way out was to load a recent save, random bits of dialogue get triggered when you walk in certain parts of the map even if a contract hasnt been started or was already completed, bounties would fail to initiate even when being in the bounty area and killing the person of interest, and many other issues not worth detailing in the review. The mechanics of the game were also really frustrating. On the most difficult mode the autosave almost never triggers and doesnt allow you to save on your own, causing you to have to redo huge portions of a level if you need to load. The big selling point of the game was how realistic is supposed to be, but the only realistic part of it is how a few aspects of bullet ballistics that are incorporated into gameplay. Often the realism was shattered by having to play into the mechanics of how the enemies moved or notice you. It was cool seeing knock offs of real long range systems (and other firearms throughout), but not anywhere enough to give Underdog another chance on anything. Lastly I wish I could say there was no story, but there is just a series of really weak tropes linked together to fabricate a series of weakly linked events you play into. As for the character himself, we never really learn about him (or see him for that matter) aside from a bunch of weird edgelord things that he says which sound like they came from the mind of what a 17 year old thinks a grizzled sniper says",1688705743,1688705743,False,22,1,0.66154181957244873,0,True,False,False

Every game they have released since SGW2 has been more of clunky mess than the previous title they release. SGW2 wasn't perfect, but I felt like it was the last SGW game I actually enjoyed. It sucks because I WANT more games like the SGW series, I'm not a fan of third person sniping games like the Sniper Elite series. I WANT SGW to be GOOD but... The core mechanics in SGW 3 to Contracts 2 all just feel bad. The way the weapons are held, the feel of the weapons aiming, shooting, reloads, it all just feels off in a bad way. The only thing that feels good is the sniping ballistics and scope adjustments, but there is still more to be desired there. I see NO reason why we can't adjust the scope for wind yet. CI needs to drop the Crye Engine and build a new game from the ground up and stop reusing all these clunky and outdated assets. As an added note, the AI are also just bad.

Some of the major issues for this game specifically, the game DOES NOT launch by default. If you purchase and install it right now, it will not launch. You have to go to the game files and give the exe administrative rights just to get the dang game to open (Win 11). Then they made one of the old systems worse to use on top of the general clunky mess these games have been. It used to be that you just change the ammo type with a button or in the wheel menu, but now you have to aim down your scope, press the button to change, then wait to reload the rifle, THEN you can use it. Why not just let us press a single button and do it on the fly? Why do we need to scope first? Also the tutorial taught us to use F to deploy the drone. You get into your first mission and press F, SURPRISE that is the grenade button now and I couldn't find how to get my drone out.

I had really hoped that CI had their shit figured out with this release given the mostly positive reviews. But they just haven't learned anything and haven't changed anything. It's just another low effort release since they tried something new with SGW3.",1688591944,1688591944,False,3,0,0.523667633533477783,0,True,False,False

Pro
- New HUD and help (example: Now you get some hints/help for the wind)
- Now your secondary rifle can be silenced. One of the most annoying thing in SGWC1
- The maps are big, for 13 USD (during sales) I got a few hours of fun
- New reward system with challenges is fair and balanced

Contra
- Challenges just not working. Challenge: kill everybody without raising the alarm. Doesn't work for more then 5 maps. Just look up the forms. So many people have a problem with the challenges
- The Enemies are just stupid. I mean if it is sniper vs. stupid bots, it would be ok. But here, they are really just brain death. I killed 3 enemies with a rifle (no silencer). So enemies about 100m away are suspicious (that's the pro part). Bodies are disposed but there are still 3 main weapons and a ton of blood on the floor. Enemies checked the spot, not bodies, all good to go. Who cares about all the blood and weapons or the missing colleagues... or the turrets that are down (hacked) or the cameras that were shoot. 
- 99% of the time it's way to easy. Even on the hardest settings. But it is fairly unbalanced on some specific longe-range sniper points. Your dam optics really has a feature for something between 100ers of meters (like 1200, 1300) to use directly. Now you have a target with 1285.... Sometimes it just feels completely wrong. I can shoot on 1285 a person with a 0.5 cal in the up part of the chest = instant death, same just 20 cm down (stomach region) and this f**** runs away and sounds alarm. Even on an edge of a cliff. This f*** would just fall down (hit by such a caliber)
- Turret is overpowered. You can kill the biggest badboys that normaly would use 0.5cal (no silencer) or AP ammo. 
- To many bugs. Just to many. You get stuck between two bushes, stuck between rocks, stuck at ..... etc. Just terrible
- Maps: Kind of sneak around and plan (cool part) and just shoot on a wide range. Kind of mixing the genre to get a bit of all. 
- Special ammo: Not all the ammo can be shoot with (most) rifles. Yes, you have to buy 2 light rifles and fully unlock everything just to get different special ammo. Com on, what a joke. The only reason for this joke is to spend the points in game. I have 2 rifles (heavy + light) that do the job. Just make it more balanced or more interesting points in the map that I choose to have more weapons. Or give more challenges (kill 100 people with a shotgun during the whole game). 
- A map is doable in less then 1 hour. I spent more time to do it ""perfect"", get all challenges etc. 
- No replay value
- There is a whole army, you just shot the most valuable person in town. No reinforcements? Why not many many soldiers that overrun you? Just to easy
- Exfiltration: In the middle of no were, all enemies down but I have to run for minutes to exfiltrate? A complete wast of time

Even with all the contra, I would give this game a positive review, as soon as all the bugs are solved. But as it looks like it goes the same way like SGWC1 that all the long known bugs are not fixed.

I just played it again after some months. 20min until I was angry again and remembered, why i stopped playing it. Dam it sucks so hard when the bugs ruin your gameplay. Just to many bugs.",1671722526,1688318254,False,3,0,0.527755022048950195,0,True,False,False

You play as Raven, a mercenary who is send in mission to accomplish contract that act as objective.
Before each contract you can choose your loadout depending on if you want beefy snipers that can shot a kilometer and a half away, or a regular smaller sniper for ""close range"" engagement, customize your weapon to your need with different bullet, add some perks you unlocked (like chain knife kills, or silent running) and enter the mission.

The game is a first person infiltration sniping game in modern time.
during the mission, you have your normal objective to progress the story, sometime optionnal objective you may do to earn some cash and challenges, that are fun objective to do (Like eliminating everyone in a area without raising the alarm, or kill some ennemies in a specific way) and add some challenge.

There is also a clever checkpoint system were you can stop a mission anytime, and come back to do the objective or a specific chellenge. For exemple, you want to do a challenge that you missed during one of your previous try, you can just start the mission, do the challenge, and exfiltrate, it will count as done, no need to do the mission entirely, and this makes the game really good to try the challenges.

This game is well balanced between infiltration, and sniping.
But the main event of this game is the sniping, and it's well done too.
As usual, you have to take in account the wind, bullet drop, movement of the target as usual, compensite on your scope.
And your mask, gives you rough approximation of the bullet trajectory, but not were it will hit exactly, and this comes tricky in aiming on long distance. But when you hit the target, and the Slowmow hit, and you see the bullet exiting the barrel, flying accross the map to hit your target, it get so satifying.
Also, you can be creative with the way you can kill your target, wether it's using AP ammo to kill 2 target with one bullet, or shooting a grenade off the ennemy chest to kill him... and his friends.

Overall, it's a fun game, challenges makes it long enough to be fun and add difficulty but also fun, it's satisfying to play, and overall very good.",1668458224,1687294496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I say hitman because it is sandbox like in how you achieve the objectives in a litany of ways, and has a lot of accompanying challenges to reward you for certain harder means . I really loved the first sniper contracts and wished they kept that sick metal mask through to this second instead of having a different iteration of the mask which i felt looked less impressive. It has really cool bullet cams that you can tweak how often they happen to fit your requirement of cool moments. One thing of improvement they could do is have the bullet cam work better for double/triple kills instead of only focusing on the first enemy killed but that is getting a bit nitpicky for how overwhelmingly good it is. I also love the intro/outro context of the story which helps you get into it.

Gunplay outside of sniping is kind of clunky. But you're not here for that. Headshots from a km away are satisfying, even if the long-range sniping missions aren't particularly engaging. I wish there was a reliable (if less hand-holdy than the easier difficulties) method to determine wind speed and direction on the hardest difficulty; an arrow and number on your scope, or maybe just more flags and other physics objects strewn about to eyeball it. As it stands, you're left guessing, essentially. For all of his near-future tech, Raven seems to have forgotten his anemometer.

Sometimes, when going for a double kill, the bullet will phase through the second enemy to no effect. It visually passes through their head, and does nothing. This is annoying, especially when it raises an alarm and fails a challenge. I haven't encountered many other severe bugs, but climbing feels broken. Jumping down from a ledge instead launches you upwards slightly, which can make for some egregiously clunky dismounts.

It's made with Cryengine, so the graphics are pretty good even on medium settings.
It is very linear, but you can choose how will you fight, except the ""long shot contracts"", because you can't go near enemies. Also, you can choose how your main target will die - explosion, crushed, headshot, etc.
You want stealth ? You have melee, silenced pistols, throwing knives, and... the amazing hunting bow. 
You want assault - there you have it: steal a Kalashnikov and you will play Serious Sam with the enemies.
You like sniping ? You can have a silenced sniper.

Now the bad ones:
First mision is the hardest, this is a heavy milestone. Because you are like naked, no accesories, no silencer to the pistol, no throwing knives, and enemies are the same all game. And also the sniper is very loud.
I hate I can't save the game when I want - one mistake and I must start over again. I spammed the ""load last saved game"" for at least 1000 times, and I didn't even finished the game yet. It would be the perfect sniper game if would have had a rewind for at least 5 seconds (or last bullet shot).
I don't understand how the power of sniper works, because a headshot is deadly anyway, why will I choose the loudest sniper when I can have a silenced one, with ArmorPenetration bullets ?

Tips & tricks:
- toogle the scope button, you will stay in that position very long periods
- shoot the jammer first (that rotating metal chunck) with an EMP bullet (won't alert enemies) or hit it with a normal bullet in the control panel, because the tagging enemies won't work (i read some reviews that this is a bug - well, it isn't); you will notice that it stops rotating

Contracts was average and left me feeling quite neutral. Same with Contracts 2, but I think Contracts was slightly better. 

Have just completed Contracts 2, with 22.9 hours game time, I remember times when Contracts 2 made me feel 'I love this game'. However it always brought me back down with a thud.

What's negative about Contracts 2, and why it brings me down:

Most importantly it felt like it was made to be harder than it needed to be. I don't think I cleared one area without raising an alarm. Given I am patient, careful, and experienced with SGW games, it was harsh. It eventually pissed me off.
Also once enemies are alarmed, even if you run away or clear the area of enemies. ... You can't fast travel! meaning once you cleared an area, you had to 'hoof-it' to reach data uploading points. Once you uploaded date, miraculously you could fast travel.
Why you even need to upload data when you're handler is watching everything from you mask. Makes no sense.   
Most of the maps are boring, dry, brown and arid.
It's the Middle East but it's not done well. Almost all the scenery is a shade of light brown, rocks and sand. 
Assets are generic. There's no point stopping to look at boxes, generators, or inside any building. Nothing is standout - it's all generic.
I had only one brief moment where I looked at some of the ruins of ancient architecture of the country. Whereas normally I'd be all over stuff like that in games - it was just too blandly made.
It feels like the developers did the bare minimum all through the game.
I kept getting stuck in the terrain, mostly at the edge of things. E.g. at the top of ladders, or the top of a hole to jump down into. Just get caught in angles. Got stuck many times in a flat metal walkway. Every time I had to reload saves to get free.
Enemies seeing you when it seems to make no sense, over and over. Reload a save file, then it happens again. Eventually you give up and play it with alarmed enemies, just to play it.
It vaguely feels like a grind.


Positives:
It's half-reasonable sniper shooter. Love me a sniper rifle in my games.
Some definite moments of gaming highs, and some quite long lasting.


Shame, because SGW:C left me feeling deflated. SGW:C2 yet more deflated.

However, there is an issue with the game saving mechanics. You cannot manually save the game. You must rely on random checkpoints and autosaves to be convenient, which they can be very frustrating. Also in regards to the saving mechanic, the game also may randomly save over your good autosaves. I was in a mission, and i raised the alarm. I went to go load my save, and the only saves that were there were saves that had the alarm raised. I had to redo about 10 minutes of scouting, and setting up to get back to where i was.
      During the missions themselves, the game often seems to want you to do the missions in a very specific way, but it doesn't exactly explain how to do it. The game wanted me to shoot through a dude, hitting a fuse box behind him. The problem is that there was another guy right beside him. I decided to use an exploding bullet to kill both dudes, and shoot the fuse box after. The game literally would not let me blow both enemies up. Like i hit dude in the chest with an exploding bullet and it didn't kill him, but killed the dude beside him. I tried several times, and i couldn't kill both people with the explosion, and the only way i could kill that one dude was if i shot him and the fuse box in the same shot. That and the many other times i had to do a contract one specific way, and i wasn't allowed to do it any other way, it was infuriating. When the game saves work fairly, and the missions are designed well, the game is very fun, but those moments are rare.
      Also, the movement is odd and takes some getting used to. It kind of feels like you are walking on ice, and your character keeps moving for a little bit after you stop pressing the movement keys. I've fallen off of so many ledges due to that. The climbing and swimming feel very choppy and weird. If you're trying to climb down a ladder, but you're too close, you'd sooner fall off the ledge than get the prompt to climb down it. 
     The AI in this game is very strange and inconsistent. Some times the you can kill people two feet away from each other and they wouldn't notice, but other times, you snipe a dude and no one is around, but the whole base is on alert.  
    In certain missions, the game just plays a sound that seems to just follow the player around. I know in one of the earlier missions, there was a sound of a bug just buzzing around the player at all times. You cannot escape this bug just screaming at you. In later missions, the game does it with other ambiance, and its less noticeable, but once you notice it, you cant un-notice it. Its just a constant, unrealistic ambiance mechanic, that feels like the character has headphones on just playing the sounds of rustling leaves. 
    Sometimes, one of the most important mechanics of the game just stops working. The pinging system is essential to keep track of enemies, but sometimes it just removes the ping after a few seconds and you find your self face to face with an unpinned enemy.
    The game has some weird physics that remove any sort of immersion. For example, enemy bodies don't float. The just sink straight to the bottom of the water. 
     As I said before, this game can be fun. The sniping mechanics are enjoyable and the game isn't absolutely a waste of time. I believe that the enjoyableness of the satisfying sniping mechanics is unfortunately outweighed by the annoying issues stated above.",1685122772,1685124120,False,0,0,0.455899864435195923,0,True,False,False

This game is good but it has a pretty terrible flaw in how enemies are loaded in. So i'll use CSGO as an example. Lets say you're at B bomb site on any map. You've got 4 enemies shooting at you. You then run through mid and head to A bomb site. Naturally you'd expect all of the enemies from B to follow you to A. But in this game, they just de-spawn. Certain buildings and doorways and tunnels are used to de-load all of the stuff behind you and load all of the stuff in front of you. So all of those enemies will just never follow you more than maybe 300 yards into the next area. This means that you can be standing 10 feet away going crazy with grenades and full auto un-suppressed weapons but because you've not walked through the special doorway that loads the next area, none of those enemies will know you exist.

Using Sniper Elite as an example, the entire map is loaded at all times. If I am standing 1,000 yards away from a Castle and shoot at the Castle, all of the enemies will hear the bullet impacts, then alert each other, then send out some soldiers to find me, or return fire. In this game, as long as I don't enter the special doorway or canyon or tunnel, the enemies do not exist. Very immersion breaking in what is otherwise a pretty good game. I'm not sure why it is like this either. The game runs fine. The engine could easily handle another 20 or 30 enemies loaded at once, but I guess whats done is done, so prepare to fight as if you're in totally seperate dimensions based on what room or valley or tunnel you're in.",1684761441,1684761496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, it's too easy. I'll give you an example: if two enemy soldiers are walking in pairs on a set course, you can listen to their dialog that takes places at various stops along their route. If you kill one of the soldiers, the other will stop moving for the rest of the time you are in the zone, because the dialog doesn't finish to trigger the next movement. Without his partner to finish the dialog, the scripting halts. So the guy just stands there, waiting to die. Also, if they are chasing you and you enter another zone on the map, then the soldiers from the first zone freeze for the rest of the time as well. They don't go back to their starting point, don't turn, don't even react to their fellow frozen soldier getting brutally (but efficiently) killed right next to them.
Second, you unlock the best guns and skills early, making it not as compelling in the late game (ie, nothing you need to upgrade, so why bother with the toughest challenges). I like the challenges, so I did them anyway, but if you don't have that sort of drive when you play a game, then this will frustrate you.
Third, it's short: 7 missions, and one is the tutorial. I have a lot of hours in the game because I often left it running and paused while I did other things. I'm guessing the game takes about 20-25 hours (less if you don't care about challenges). 
Fourth, some map textures are broken, causing your sniper to get stuck in terrain. You can't really predict when this will happen. When it does, you have to reload. That's not usually a problem, except there are some challenges that must be finished with a single play through, so if you reload then you can't get that challenge. Also the game auto-saves, so you don't control frequency or location of the save, and it cannot save if there are enemy soldiers within a certain distance of you. So sometimes, the last save was an hour ago.

I finished it, but by missions 5, 6, and 7, I was fed up with the problems in the game. Story line is anemic, but I was going to play it to the end to see if it got better. It did not. Maybe buy it deeply discounted if you like sniping/thieving games. Otherwise, you're not missing much by skipping it.

Of note, I wish the enemy ai was better in the lower difficulties. I like the red dot that makes life easy, sue me; I also like enemies I feel like I have to strategize around. The ai is so dumbed-down at Marksman/Sharpshooter that it really feels like the game is babying you a bit. A difficulty system like in some Sniper Elite games where I could keep ballistics on easy mode and crank up the enemy awareness would be perfect for me. That's my only real issue with the game, and the enhanced scopes and wind indicator make up for it enough that it's honestly a tiny inconvenience and didn't hinder my experience much. Overall, I love my time with this game and recommend it to anybody looking for a modern, pick-up and play singleplayer fps.

Execution is good and the game is mostly enjoyable, but the good parts are something others have done better, or have failed before in same issues.

There are two types of missions, ""classic contracts"" and ""long shot contracts"". 
Classic contracts are your basic stealth gameplay that have been done in various games moderately well since Thief-series. You infiltrate in enemy bases and eliminate targets or perform sabotage without getting noticed.
Problems with this:
[list]
[*]Others have done this before. Some better. If this is what you like, go play Dishonored. 
[*]In forest/jungle areas, whether enemy can see you or not feels random.
[*]In desert areas, enemy feels like they are seriously short-sighted.
[*]NPCs are dum-dums that you can bottleneck and execute in cue. This allows you to clear most of the fortifications.
[*]Is stealth infiltration to enemy bases really part of the art of sniping? No.
[*]Does somebody actually use their gadgets?
[/list]

In long shot contracts you shoot from afar. I don't know who though this was a fun idea. You are deprived of proper approach and planning of execution and you are forced to shoot predetermined targets from predetermined spot.
Problems with this:
[list]
[*]Half of missions are long shot contracts.
[*]You are not actually doing anything you way, just executing preplanned gameplay. Like playing a train simulator.
[*]NPC waves spawn around you. This is cheap way to challenge you.
[*]Gadgets are mostly useless.
[/list]

If you want to make a sniping game, it needs to be a mix of these two game modes. Proper approach, with enemy patrols that can track you from ques your actions leave behind. Leaving sensors behind that tell you if your movements are tracked and location compromised. Planning a proper execution, by scouting good firing spots, using gadgets to determine wind conditions and planning your safe exit from area. For adjustable difficulty there can be a computer controlled scope that makes the proper adjustment as long as you give it a correct wind and distance values. Sniper should not infiltrate base fortifications, but provide overwatch for special forces team making the infiltration and their plan is something you need to consider when you make your own plans. Now that would be a game about art of sniping.",1682782778,1683800122,False,61,1,0.758929550647735596,0,True,False,False

The classic contracts are enjoying where you can take enemies apart at your own approach and pace. Half of the regions consist of long shot contracts and these are awful. Shooting someone over 1 km becomes a matter of ballistic chance. Often when missing the contract ran away and you are unable to catch them on such a long distance.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Set between 2019 and 2020, Contracts 2 isn't so much a story as it is a series of things simply happening. Players don the high tech mask of Raven, an anonymous contract killer for hire who has entered a deal with an equally anonymous employer to assassinate several high profile targets in the fictional nation of Kuamar and take down the country's leader, Bibi Rashida, before she can invade a neighboring country and ignite war across the region.  Under the steady guidance of his anonymous contact, Raven will work his way from target to target and eliminate them all as he goes. There's very little in the way of characters here. Raven and his handler exhibit the sort of comfortable light banter that two seasoned professionals tend to engage in when there's little else to do besides chat, and while this will certainly elicit a chuckle; neither of them ever get to truly be characters.  It's very clear that the bare bones ""story"" exists wholly to serve as context for the contract style the gameplay follows, and thus it is utterly devoid of any real merit to speak of.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
An FPS with an emphasis on sniping, SGWC2 drops players into a handful of different areas of operation which are split into two types: short range and long. Long range missions drop Raven onto often cave riddled plateau's overlooking multiple enemy outposts that can be up to a kilometer and a half away from his shooting position.  These jobs involve reaching and clearing a sniping position of enemy defenses so that he can then deal with whatever target he has been hired to eliminate from the camp down off in the distance.  Short range missions are larger than they sound, often taking place in areas a square kilometer in size at a minimum and often being highly intricate mazes of paths, tunnels, and clearings; sometimes forcing Raven to get up close and personal in order to reach his objectives.  Unlike the long range missions, he has the scope of the whole map to run around on during these.  Each map offers its own challenges, bounties, and collectibles to hunt down as well, which in turn, reward points for unlocking different equipment Raven can use in future jobs. A plethora of snipers, combat arms, handguns, attachments, gadgets, and abilities can be purchased to give players even more of an edge, though there are many items that feel outright useless compared to others. You could remove the majority of weapons from the game and nothing would really change for the end user other than shorter menus. Some upgrades are laughably overpriced for what little they do while other far more game changing abilities come earlier and at significantly less cost. Each area of the game is filled with outposts large and small and players are given the freedom to tackle these places in any way they wish or even just avoid them. Although sniping is your best tool, as Raven can fall to just a burst or two of concentrated fire, he's more than capable of holding his own in a stand up fight with the tools he has available and if your aim is true. The sniping itself feels fantastic. Players can gauge target distance by instant instinct, a brief scope measurement, or taking the time to activate their mask's zoom and tag for the most accurate if slowest method of gauging range. Meanwhile, the mask itself highlights how wind will affect the bullet at all ranges, but players are free to zero their sight if they wish for a more centered shot. This ultimately turns sharp shooting into a little minigame all its own that rewards thorough preparation, good measuring skills, or good instincts equally; while hard mode turns off distance tagging and handler advice; forcing players to truly learn how to measure their ranges. Shots well past the 250 meter mark are a joy to watch as their tracer takes over a second to arc down directly into the skull of whichever poor guard you've pulled the trigger on and shots past one thousand meters are pure bliss. Enemies are quick to alert and thus need to be dropped quickly in turn. If they catch sight of you, hear you, or find evidence of your work; you have mere seconds to silence them before the outpost goes into full alert; though thankfully neighboring outposts won't get the memo. When inside an outpost, enemies will try to rush, frag, and flush Raven out until he's dead; and they can be a genuine threat. On the other hand, if you're sniping from outside, they can do little more than hide behind cover, spray bullets or mortars in your general direction, or be one of the brave few that tries to pull out their binoculars to slowly scan for you. It's a shame they can't do much more than that but it does make you feel like a lead slinging force of nature that empties entire bases without anyone even realizing it has happened. The game can certainly feel repetitive at times and even frustrating when things go wrong in a way that might not feel fair, but overall the sense of freedom, the interconnected nature of the maps, and the solid shooting makes tackling each contract satisfying enough to enjoy doing it all the way to the end.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
Visually speaking, Kuamar's environments look fantastic albeit repetitive.  When you've seen one rocky desert, you've seen them all.  The artists did their best to add some level of variation with time of day, water sources, and base layouts, but the game ultimately has only one true stand out location.  Mount Kuamar is a forested middle-eastern mountainside on the very edge of an encroaching thunderstorm and also features a rather unexpected change of scenery hidden within the level itself.  The whole mission is simply excellent.  Raven's design stands out as a bit mismatched for the setting but still conveys that he's a lone wolf professional who only carries what he needs.  Sound design is absolutely perfect.  Whether it's the over emphasized *clunk-CHING* of an ejecting bullet casing or the thick environmental atmosphere, it all delivers. The harsh muted thud of a round blasting out of a silenced barrel doesn't get much better than it does here, and the bullet kill cams are great if a bit drawn out at times. Animation as a whole is weighty and impactful with the exception of reload animations which feel stiff and awkward.  Music is punching far above the weight of what this game is, which is a shame.  The soundtrack is phenomenal and honestly, despite Contracts 2 being a fine video game, the music deserves to be in a much higher caliber work.  Voice acting is solid, though the actors are hardly performing roles that let them truly become a character.  Still, you might grow attached to the sound of the handler in your ear by the end.",1683315589,1683315589,True,9,0,0.650793612003326416,0,True,False,False

It's an amazing game with incredible physics and graphics. I feel as though some areas could have had more love, such as enemy responses, weapons (number of), attachments could have been more in-depth, and the whole stealth system could have been more intuitive (it's realistic, when you're too close to enemies and shoot a suppressed weapon, they actually hear it as you would in real life). I think sometimes when you take out 2 enemies in rapid succession but the entire base gets alerted even though there were no witnesses and they wouldn't have had time to radio it in, I think that's a bit crappy but it is what it is, nothing is ever perfect and my review should hopefully deter those expectations.

It is a great game, the story is decent but it kinda leaves you feeling empty or like there could have been more to it, like more cinematics or more meaningful story line. 

Solid 8/10 however, would recommend playing through it at least once, and don't recommend the hardest difficulty. I tried hardest and it was borderline insane, this game requires a lot of patience.",1682765220,1682765220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mean, it is pretty fun and engaging game so far. The sniper mechanics are not on a sim level but the game manages to find a good balance between realistic and fun in that manner. My huge problem is this:

When you disable HUD and radar and all, for more immersion, you can't select secondary equipment (nades, drones, meds etc.) properly because a part of the HUD IS the equipment selection wheel... At least gimme an animation of how much ammo left in my weapon's mag (and how many mags I have left) when I press a button like in Tarkov damnit. You also lose the subtitles too since it is also a HUD element. Like technically yes it is but wtf lol. 
 
We need more accessibility options for the game. I don't want any HUD or assistance from our latest-tech headgear but I need to see what the fkkk I chose for my secondary equipment when I'm trying to throw a knife at my enemy in full stealth. It doesn't help when yo boi Raven throws a live grenade on the lap of a militia grunt instead of a knife...

Last time I was getting stuck in textures was... uhm... early 2000s? Here I get stuck not in the textures, but just out of blue. Every time there's some tiny difference in elevation - bang we're stuck again. Load game. 
Next hugely annoying thing is a bug with changing the gear upon exfiltration. Yes it can be changed, but the next time the game is loaded, you will be reverted back to the original load out that was used right in the beginning of the mission. And there's no way of loading before exfiltration or during one. 
Finally, the one which is driving me insane is supposedly an RNG taking place when playing on the hardest difficulty. It pretty much adds some tiny but crucial error to the aiming. Let's say you got a perfect weather no wind and quite reliable 1000m on binoculars. You set the aim hold you breath and... miss. Load game. Absolutely same scenario, same aiming. Hit! And the scales of the fucking RNG is not in your favour. Perhaps developers considered the first part way too easy even on the hardest (which is, honestly true), and decided to simply ""correct"" this by adding RNG. What a pathetic solution.

Cherry on top - level design. Massive maps filled with static buildings and decorations. Stupid disposition of troops. Clueless AI. And last but not least - absolutely moronic decision to FORCE player into long range shooting with no ability to walk to the location. This could be alright if not the amount of hostiles and all the bugs I mentioned above. Now if you want to get maximum challenges prepare to spend hours. As of now I spent about 12 hours and finished only 3 missions. THIS IS INSANELY STUPID. I feel stupid. I'll make the right move - uninstall and spend my time with better quality.

It has it's bugs, and some of the level design & climbing parts are annoying, but overall it's a good sniping game with a somewhat decent story. There are quite a few ways to achieve objectives - The weaponry selection and modification is pretty good and modern for the most part, with some fictional equipment here and there.

The gun play, and movement feels slightly clunky at times but were good for the most part. I believe the clunkiness comes from the enviroments being so detailed. This game did push an EVGA 3080ti at times - I could hear active cooling here and there. I did notice some artifacting here and there when looking around in cave areas for some reason. The graphics are very good for this type of niche game.

The sniping ballistics and breath holding (stamina-based) which are the meat and potatoes of the game, are fun. There is bullet cam, and it's satisfying. Even on deadeye difficulty, it was not too bad getting into a rhythm, dialing in your range/windage, and going to work. The armored enemies can be taken out with precise shots to the neck if your aim is good enough.

I finished the game entirely on deadeye difficulty and died a bunch but my saved games never got screwed up. I felt like the save system wasn't punishing at all but it lacks granular control of when/where you save in my opinion. The best thing you can do is finish an objective or two, then go to an exfiltration zone, that will save your progress, you can resupply or change your loadout and then from there you can either continue on the mission or exit the game.

*You can re-load the last save and look at the corpse again, it will be able to get it.

4.Poor game performance, I have above recommend system requirement environment, but it was so laggy with auto-detect setting (1920x1080 with Very High graphic)

1. The gun play feels good, and for all types of weapons. Hitting headshots from any distance feels satisfying. No further questions on that front.
2. Successfully sniping a moving target from 1000+ meters after calculating the bullet's trajectory feels incredible. I have played a **** ton of Call of Duty and Battlefield over the years, but they just can't compete with the variety of sniping challenges in this game.
3. There is a lot of replay value! Just in my first several hours of playing, I found myself repeating the first mission (yup, I am a casual gamer) over and over until I nailed the basic mechanics, and figured out strategies for completing the various ways of approaching each contract.
4.  Accommodating of multiple play styles. I can take my time, chill out, and focus on precision/stealth/strategy, or I can go loud and mow down all o' them bad guys if I'm starting to feel impatient.

Overall, highly recommend. My review will probably carry more weight as I've logged more hours in the game, but I was so impressed that I felt compelled to write one now. I hope there will be a SGWC 3 in the near future!",1679341616,1679341616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't really understand why ""Long Range Contract"" are a thing It's basically a small open world where you go to different sniping spots instead of having direct access to the area. It give a cool opportunity for some long range sniping (1000+ meters) but i don't understand why there is a small open world. Just make us spawn at the shooting spot. In the end it's just a contract where you loose the stealth option. (I don't really consider ""Loud"" as an option. Not why i bought the game.) 

I usually play the game more as a stealth game so only having 3 contract where infiltration was an option was a disapointing.

In this one one we have ""Raven"" and ""Control"" which aren't bad but are a lot more talkative and i prefered the professionalism of ""Handler"" and ""Seeker"".

It's by no means a masterpiece, but it takes pieces of milsim, gun-n-run FPS, and even Ubisoft open world shooters, and somehow it all just works without overreaching. There are none of the true-to-life gun details down to the notch on the rails, or big explosions and epic assaults, horse testicles, or anything like that... but damn it's just releases buckets of dopamines to pop those brain-obliterating headshots from 1900m away, stealth kills a camp without anyone noticing, or just pop the target and slip away without anyone ever even realized anything. 

Love the level design here, and there is a lot of potential. There are plenty of checkpoints, and fast travel points, so it is rarely ever annoying to just reload if things isn't going the way you want, so you can play like a pro assassin and get those dopamine-release moments that you want, however you want. And the mission maps feel big but not Ubisoft-greedy filled with too much shit to care about. The layout always guide you toward scenarios but allow you enough space to ""play your way"". This type of level design is probably unique to this franchise, and there are a lot of potential here. Contracts 3 can build city levels (ahemGothamKnightDeadshotahem) and you can still get the same feeling of vastness without overreaching.

The story can pretty much be ignored with this type of games, but it does serves well to push the game forward. But I love the relationship between Raven and his handler. The handler is like a polite British man who just has the ""caring father"" vibes, always giving supportive comments, urging his son onward to destabilize regimes. Raven himself is a brutal sociopath (the way he interrogates enemies is just mean-spirited), but in a way that is antithetical to the goal of his employer so it doesn't feel like he's just another bland country-loving jarhead. This guy is a contracted killer, he loves his job and it shows. 

Generally if you like stealth games and vibe with the whole ""freelance assassin destabilizing regime at all costs"" deal then this game is for you. Though I wish there is more to the ""Contract"" side of the game, and generally better placements of enemies because they are either very braindead, or the rival sniper materializes out of thin air right as you load in and just zero on you. This is by no means a masterpiece, but it is so much fun that it is a guilty pleasure to play.

The game starts with a short tutorial section where you learn how to use your sniper rifle. Then it's time to jump into some missions that have you on the run or in a firefight.

The game-play is challenging, but it's also fun and makes me feel like I'm part of an elite sniper team. The missions are challenging enough to keep me coming back for more, but not so hard that they feel unfair or impossible to complete.

I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a new way to play first-person shooters!

Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is an amazing game that you can play for endless hours. The game is not just about shooting, it's about sneaking through the levels, collecting Intel, and taking out targets from afar. The game-play is so realistic that you feel like a sniper yourself. The missions are challenging and fun at the same time. It's a lot of fun to play this game with friends or family members because it's easy to pick up for everyone involved.

The graphics are great, and you can't beat the sound effects when you're shooting someone with your sniper rifle! There are dozens of different guns to collect and use during missions, so there's always something new to try out every time you play. You also get access to different types of grenades that will help you take out enemies without being seen or heard by them.

If you like first person shooters or want something unique that's not available anywhere else on the market then Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is definitely worth checking out!",1677077637,1677077637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Difficulty is punishing, which is good, but unfair, which is bad. Enemies can hit you with astonishing accuracy from 500+ meters, with any kind of gun. They all learn your position as soon as one does. They are especially adept with grenades. The inability to manual save is also huge negative for me.

The map is terrible, and traversal is a pain. The minimap lacks cardinal directions. Some ledges can be climbed, other identical ledges of the same height cannot. Sometimes you'll get stuck on a ledge, and getting stuck on terrain in general is common. 

This kind of jankiness and inconsistency is common to a lot of the game's mechanics. Sometimes you take fall damage, sometimes you don't. It's often impossible to tell whether an action will alert enemies until you do it. Enemies can often see you through walls.

All of that being said, it has great sniping and the sequel could be amazing if they ironed out the flaws. I paid $15 which is about what it's worth. If steam had a better rating system I'd call it a 5.5/10. If you want a sniper game, this delivers.",1675363975,1675401356,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great stealth sniper/infiltrator mechanics. Maps go back and forth between Long shot and Classic. Maps are fairly small, with fast travel locations for easy access. 
The auto save is an easy way to scum save if you are having trouble with some challenges, other challenges dont let you scum save. How good can you actually be?
The hardest difficulty takes away the distance above targets, so I had a hard time with that. Remembering numbers and not being dyslexic are not my strong suits. But trajectory and drop, that I can do. You can get flooded with money jsut replaying missions, making it fairly easy to get all the weapons. Buuuut.

+ if you like SGW:C1 you'll like this one, basically more of the same with new content 
+ long-distance sniping is satisfying without being too incredibly difficult (I started on 2/4, was too easy so bumped it to 3/4, about right for me)
+ other reviewers (of I think very early versions of the game) have complained about enemies with assault rifles hitting you from 1000m, this is simply not true any more, they're limited to probably 100m, which seems fair to me)
+ excellent graphics, environments, and map design

Cons:
- enemy AI is very bad, worse than SGW:C1, they get stuck on everything, they bug out and freeze up, some maps more than others
- even on difficulty 3/4, enemy vision is pretty bad, less than 50m it seems.. I would think that could go up a little
- same enemy distribution/ranking as SGW:C1, would have liked something new

In short:
I've played it (and completed it) as well as all the previous ones in the series. This one is a cheaper version of the Contracts 1 game. If you want to experience the same but better, get that one. If you want better story go for ghost warrior 3. If you want more infiltration go for SGW 2 or even 1. They all have issues but they're not bad.

In more details:
The voice acting is decent, so is the music and the audio environment. The game is pretty. It's not a bad game but it's clearly sub-par in regard of their very own previous game. Less content, more bugs, less terrain variation. 

The good thing is that you can enjoy it despite numerous glitches such as: you often can't shoot and control magnification without exiting zoom; getting stuck everywhere on the map is back with a vengeance (it's an issue since the first game but they almost sorted it in the last one); crazy AI where ennemies become ultra aggressive with pinpoint accuracy and wallhack but lose all pathfinding in hardest difficulty (it's often harder in normal mode since the AI is less dummy); audio getting stuck on a loop; etc.

The bad is that you can get around the glitches because none seem to be really game breaking or make the game crash but the difficulty has been severely cut down to compensate. You can often frolic around even in hard mode because you need to, since crawling gets you stuck especially while equipped with the sniper rifle (yeah...). So the AI is blind and kinda irrational compared to the previous games to compensate.

You basically need 2 rifles, one heavy (RON something that can equip every special ammo)  and one all-round light (RIIHIMAKI dead silent with large clip) and 1 of the 2 handguns with highest silence stats. The rest is pure filler simply because the missions and maps aren't diverse enough to even let players create their own challenge by trying out new gear combination. The bow is fun but the handguns are quicker and just as silent, unless you're at medium range. 

The missions are completely static, except for 1 ennemy that has 2 fighting spawn locations but only if you get detected. If you play once and have a good memory then you can speedrun the next time. Regarding the missions style, the only neat kinda new thing is the long distance ones but that's not enough to carry the whole game. The drone is a nifty gadget that's usefull in the previous game. Here you're likely to forget about it because they made it so that it's disabled most of the time. Sad. The turret is also a fun pice of gear allowing to take out 2 ennemies at once or other neat stuff to have some fun.

The story is even lighter than in contracts 1 and is really just there to fill the loading screen and give somewhat of a sense of purpose...even though let's be real we all just wanna pop heads from afar. No matter why. They tried to instill some emotions between the character and the handler but in this very thin story it's rather cringe.

So the sniping mechanism is okay. Well, firstly they mostly managed to fix an awful game design from the previous games: the ennemies don't pop in and out and then reset if you scan the area then move to one of the dedicated sniping nest (it's a frustrating part of the previous games). They mostly did so with smaller play areas though, hence the long shot focused ones to compensate . It's still not an open world (and there's no need) but more of arenas connected without loading time. Which is an ok design but to experience a more continuous infiltration experience, you need to play older games (SGW 2 and 3) which have neat features as well.
Second, there is still a bullet time camera which is fun -without excess since there's 1 animation- and you can tweak it in the settings. That's where the main issue starts. The bullet time camera is not a ballistic trajectory but dead on hitscan. The game pauses during the animation and wherever you aimed, the bullet goes straight. This means that not only can you use this to cheese the game but you don't even have a choice since some challenges require both a direct line shoot that can be achieved with an in game special bullet but with an armor piercing bullet. It's a small detail but it makes the game inconsistent when you try to play on highest difficulty with no save, no alarm and no fail (the game doesn't allow to disable save it's a voluntary choice btw) unless you completely disable it. Another forced cheese is when you relad a save, the bodies disappear and other ennemies don't get alerted. I feel like at least in hard mode, this shouldn't be so. The targetting is also sometimes spotty and this can be seen when activating the red dot. It takes some playing around to get the game to detect that you're on target. Not a big deal but it's something to keep in mind.

Again with this one, it feels like they're really close to producing a game that would easily rival with Sniper Elite but some weird inconsitencies remain. As if they still can't properly test and design the game because of poor communication between departments and despite having all the pieces. Most of the issues are obvious for anyone used to these games after just one mission and the good ideas are underused or spread too thin. But I'm sure they'll eventually get to it since this series seems to get more and more popular. The only thing that I miss is the creativity of the previous games. Each one had a different enough setting, story, weapons and gameplay that it didn't feel like a commercial series but a real attempt at providing some value to the franchise. Let's hope this one is just an in-between to keep people hooked.

So all in all, it's very playable and clearly a quick blend rehash of the first Contracts game. It's somewhere between a big DLC (real ones, not their expensive skins) and a new game. It's geared towards more casual gamers even in highest difficulty. Get it when it's under 15eur/usd next year or so and play the previous ones instead (SGW 3 has a very nice DLC mission with story!). There's no multiplayer.

Pros: Decent graphics, decent sound. Nice kill shots.

Even on its easiest setting, you have to micro managing each shot.  No pointing and just shooting.  The game developer took the concept and decided to get into the 'weeds."" If you want a sniping game where you don't have to worry about distance, bullet drop, etc. then head to the Sniper Elite series.  This game is for folks that want to control every aspect of the gun and how it behaves.  Could use a few more missions.  Bad guys all went to ""gun school"" so they have no issues hitting you from hundreds of feet away.  Additionally, each location is barren, no NPC's, no animal life, nada.

A couple important points: Far Cry 3 came out in 2012. This was released in 2021. Far Cry beats this game in every way possible.
- Not open world, you can only approach each objective by following the path
- you are invisible or seen, 32 hours in and I am not sure where the line between these states is (yes, there is a 'you are about to be seen indicator.. but I don't think foliage does anything)
- 'replayable' to get the challenges you can only do with specific weapons
- AI is both too responsive (the entire map alerts), too predictable (limited pathing), and forgets really easy
- You have a cool drone, but you can only use it when the jamming towers are not around
- a hit center mass with a medium sniper rifle may or may not take your target out

""It's too hard. The AI can spot too easy.""

The AI are blind. They cannot see you 100 meters away with binoculars. Unless you have already alerted them, in which case they get 2000+ meters x-ray vision.

""I cant hit my shots""

Then maybe you shouldn't be playing a game that has SNIPER in the F****** TITLE! In all seriousness though, with the aim assist that CAN'T BE DISABLED, which is the same problem I had with Contracts 1, the amount of shots that somehow change trajectory, and yes I am accounting for wind and gravity, is ridiculous. Also, Bullet cam is required to actually force hits to count as hits half the time, not to mention it stops time so it can hit a moving target without leading.

""Its worth $20, maybe $15.""

I am so glad I got in on the christmas sale for $15...

""It a ripoff of Sniper Elite. Sniper Elite is more realistic.""

Don't talk about realism with a 3rd person game! As for being a ripoff, how? In what way? The gore maybe, but thats hardly a ripoff, not to mention less detailed here.

Map
The minimap is fantastic, but the full map is so confusing that sometimes it's easier to go without it. Most maps you use in the real world have roads written on them, but this one is a static image so it's difficult to gauge what's up or down, or how to get across a mountain pass.

Ex-filtration 
The exfil is a cool mechanic, but fast traveling is disabled after finishing a mission so you have to run to an exfil which is sometimes on the other side of a mountain which is a super time consuming activity, especially after killing everyone. It becomes quite boring.

CLIMBING
The climbing in this game should have just been left out to begin with. The animations do not cohesively link together and it's clunky. Sometimes the tracking doesn't grab onto a ledge and you'll fall and die. I've died more to falling than anything other than...

GRENADES
I don't know what it is, but these soldiers are more accurate than the Harlem globe trotters with their grenades. They will land between your feet every single time and absolutely WRECK you.

Challenges
Some challenges are easy, some are fun, but it seems like most of them are just a drag to try to complete.

Collaterals
Sometimes shooting two soldiers that are lined up results in a collateral kill, but it seems unpredictable without the kill cam on. Sometimes you'll kill them both and sometimes you'll immediately trip the alarm.

Alarms
The alarms never seem consistent. It's as if a soldiers senses you anywhere remotely near it when you kill someone, it's an instant alarm or not. You never know. 

Autosaves
They either save infrequent enough or at the most inconvenient time. They're really frustrating. 

But I did like some stuff about the game:
Weapon selection
A small, but well variety of weapons keep things interesting, but you'll end up only choosing one or two you like. I would've liked to see weapon challenges. The guns are well made and are satisfying no matter which one is chosen.

Map design
Most maps are designed well and keep each place fresh. Sucks there's only like 6, but it's still nice. It would've been cool to have a jungle or a forest just to give something different. 

Equipment
There are some cool equipment in the game like the drone (which somehow they can find your body controlling it if they can just spot it flying around for some reason). I never used traps, but they're there if that's your play style.

Freedom
You don't have to follow the contract in a specific order, just go how you feel like it. It's great for completing challenges or replaying your favorite missions. You can be stealth or go guns blazing, either way you'll get the job done. 

One-Shot One-Kill
The MOST satisfying thing is shooting super long distances at a moving target and get those sweet red hit markers. Just taking it slow and picking off soldiers one by one is super fun and probably the best part of the game.",1671855320,1671855380,True,27,1,0.750039815902709961,0,True,False,False

However as someone who's new to the franchise these are my thoughts: 

Pros: 
-Sniping is always fun, like in previous games. It's no ultra realism sniping game but it doesn't have to be, measuring the wind and bullet drop, even if the mask does most of the work for you, is fun nonetheless. 
-I feel much more connected to the narrative of this game compared to the previous one. In the first contracts game you were always told what doing your tasks would achieve, it still didn't feel like your actions impacted anything as they were't really touched up on after you completed the mission. 
-NPC dialogue was for the most part enjoyable, I found myself chuckling at some lines of dialogue between NPCs. 
-The gadgets you can use such as the drone, remote sniper turret, gas mines, etc. were all very enjoyable to use and most certainly made me feel like i had a technological edge over the enemy. 
-The gore I personally enjoy a lot, I found it pretty gruesome to see a closeup of someone's head after hitting dead on target. I am most confident in many circumstances that I have given many NPCs PTSD from watching their leader's heads explode. 
-The relationship between Raven and his Handler I enjoyed far more than Seeker's from the first contracts. In that game while there were some funny lines of dialogue between them they didn't really seem to mesh too well together. However in this game Raven's dynamic is more enjoyable, while primarily it's at a professional level there are some moments both during missions and cut-scenes which I found enjoyable. 
-I enjoy that the villains of the game aren't just ""The Russians"" again, personally I find it a nice change of pace for games of this genre to encompass more of the world than just Russia. 

Cons: 
-Sniping is really the most enjoyable part of the game, the ""ghost"" and ""warrior"" parts leave much to be desired. If you raise the alarm enemies are able to spot you nearly instantly from well over 1,000 meters away and begin to shoot at you with unnerving accuracy. This is even applicable to when you use gadgets such as the turret and drone, they will know your location despite the fact the thing they spot is nowhere near you. 
-As fun as the drone is to use, I also found it frustrating that it seemed like you never actually got to use the thing. This is due primarily to the anti-drone towers which are scattered about far too liberally for each map to make proper scouting use out of it. This wouldn't be a problem if you could destroy them, however there is only one form of jammer that you can disable in the game. All other types you just simply have to deal with them disallowing you from using a tool that you put perk points into to use more effectively. 
-Movement in areas is clunky and slow, the parkour system that they try to implement is cool on paper. In the first contracts game I felt that it was fluid enough to pass and did make me feel like a badass. However that is sadly not the case here, as the same parkour system is somehow clunky and oftentimes frustrating to try and navigate. I have found myself sometimes unable to dismount off of ledges as the character automatically grabs it again after letting go. In addition to the parkour system, you sometimes just simply keep getting caught on terrain such as small branches and piles of rubble that will either completely stop you in your tracks or cause you to move at a literal snails pace. The parkour system also forces you to stand from crouch, making stealth all that much harder as you have to stand up, then look at the ledge, then press space, and then press ""W"", and then crouch again to continue sneaking, which can get tedious. 
-The NPCs don't have very many varied lines of dialogue, which while I enjoyed some of them they did get tedious to hear over and over again. 
-Dialogue in interrogations can be comically edgy, while whether this would quantify as a Con or not I'm sure varies from person to person. But for me it just felt silly and a complete tonal clash to what the game was trying to do. 
-Terrain and objects have wide hit-boxes that make some areas of the game more difficult than they should be. In some circumstances you have to stand pretty far in the open to be able to ping enemies with the visor, use the laser pointer for the sniper turret, or to make shots with the sniper rifle. 

I do want to say that this isn't a bad game, overall I feel like it was fun but mediocre and definitely could use more polish. I wish steam had a ""meh"" option to choose from, as I probably will replay this game at some point later. I mulled between recommending it and not recommending it, and finally I came down to this decision which was ""would I recommend this game at full price?"" To which I would answer, no, do not buy this game at full price. I most certainly still did have fun with this game despite its faults, but I don't feel the quality of the game fairly reflects the price they ask for.",1671599525,1671599525,False,1,0,0.510489523410797119,0,True,False,False

Contracts 2 has really solid sniping mechanics, you only really get to experience them at their finest during the long shot contracts.

Pros:
Solid stealth mechanics. The hud is informative and i never feel like it wasn't my own fault getting caught
Sneaking up and getting melee kills can feel really satisfying and the interogation option is a nice touch.
The melee can be absurdly deadly at any angle which makes CQC more fun than i feel like i should be having.
Mid range combat feels solid as well with responsive weapons.
The gore is almost comical sometimes but i love it, the right kind ""oof"" when you see the physics ripple through someones face.

Cons
Theres not alot of missions here sadly. The ones we have are good but i feel like theres more we should have had.
Some objectives are not clearly defined or detailed at all which led to some confusion on some levels especially when you need to find 3 of something but the 3rd item in question is nothing like the others.
AI is pretty dumb and sometimes blind, sound apparently doesn't travel nearly as far as you'd think.
Autosave is on some sort of timer and as long as you aren't actively in combat or near enemies it'll autosave which can lead to shenannigans.

All in all a very solid game with just a few minor issues. the quality outweighs the problems easily and if you snag this on sale its perfect.",1671427889,1671427889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's interesting to paint targets for tracking, to learn enemy routes, and to make sure vision lines don't intersect as you systematically remove threats between you and your objective. It is not fun the moment you remove the wrong person or 'piece' of this puzzle and you almost feel obligated to scrap the entire exercise to get the perfect 'stealth' clear - if not because of the enemy's erratic movement, but the moment they call for backup and you engage in a firefight, a stiff breeze is enough to kill you.

I have played through this game on the ""sharpshooter"" difficulty and cleared all the contracts, but having spent 30+ hours on this game I can say with a good degree of certainty I am not willing to go back and 100% it.

However, it does have some problems:
- No manual save or quick save. At the same time many challenges require absolute precision and sometimes luck. The auto-save is frequent, but not frequent enough.

- NPCs are too sensitive. One wrong move and the whole area is alerted and coming directly to you.

- Not frequent, but noticeable amount of places you can get stuck in (no movement). It's an issue with Cry Engine, but still. Usually, when you get stuck, it helps to switch to a pistol (for some reason).

- Collectibles are too well blended with the environment. Collectible mini-map (sensor and pointer) is useless.

- Gas arrows (bow, crossbow) are not working. You can sometimes hit a pair of enemies and they both go down (one from the arrow, the other one from gas, as intended). However, in many occasions even if you hit one NPC in the head with a gas arrow, it may or may not die while the second NPC standing right next to the first one may or may not drop from the gas. Completely random and unreliable - thus useless.

- Bugged targeting helper dot (on lower difficulties) when you increase the distance adjustment. You can clearly see the position calculation function struggling when switching between high distances (900-1000 m and up).

- Propaganda filled dialogue full of the most bland, generic tropes you can think of.

I will admit its kinda fun but the more you play the more you see it isnt made by a good reputable company. There is quite a few times youll 1 shot a heavy in the face and they die. Other times they never die even after 5 face shots with a sniper. Its more of a game thats not play how you want. Its play how the developers want you too. Meaning if you can figure out how to kill the 2 guys next to each other who never move. Youll end up using google to see and theres only 1 way to do it. I would say this is a knock off copy of sniper elite just set in a desert setting rather than killing nazis. 
Pretty bummed I really wanted to like this game cause I love stealth games but there needs to be more than 1 way to kill everyone in a base. 
Would NOT recommend anybody spend a dollar on this game when sniper elite is free on game pass. Save yourself time, frustration and not to mention the fact this game you can beat in no time at all.

After playing a couple of the other sniper games from this studio, this one is definitely the best, but still plenty of annoying things that makes me glad I finished everything in under 15 hours. Still pretty fun, and better than I expected. Played on the second hardest difficulty, and wasnt too hard, outside of getting spotted is a nightmare.

Pros:
- Level design actually impressed me a good bit. Open mini-areas, with a few really cool area designs and multi-approach layouts. Lots of optional things to do to make your life easier.
- Small but satisfying gun options.
- Pretty good graphics, runs smooth.

Cons:
- A few spots will get u stuck like sliding down things or tree limbs.
- Getting spotted is awful. Cannot quick-save, but auto-save every 5ish mins makes u wish it did have the feature anyway.
- When you get alerted to, everyone that has line of sight to you, even those who are 1300+ meters away, will immediately start firing at you and will hit you with insane accuracy. Feels ridiculously dumb. 
- It really is pretty short. There are like 3 long shot missions and 4 classic missions (more close quarters). The long shot missions are really cool, but feel like minigames. Some of the long shot missions have you get unavoidably flanked by people and it feels very out of place. 

If you think this genre is fun, but the other sniper games got too low reviews, play this one first. If you still want more, there are other options, but this is about as good as it gets. 7/10,",1668137273,1668137273,True,35,0,0.792105019092559814,0,True,False,False

This game is essentially Far Cry 3, but instead of an empty open world, it was made by level designers (novel concept, I know). I'm unfamiliar with all the other Sniper Ghost Warrior games so that's about the only comparison I can make.

You can tell they went for a bit of replayability by adding in some Hitman-style challenges to each mission, but unfortunately this game lacks the sandbox of the Hitman series. You'll likely give it a single playthrough, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. A nice break if you are used to playing high stakes games and want to play a ninja power fantasy with some fun gore effects.

I paid $40 for it, but if you see it on sale it's an easy grab. It's always refreshing to see Cry Engine used for something other than Ubisoft shovelware.

The game is a 4 mission story, plus two add on missions, or really 1 1/4 add on missions.

I liked the difficulty options; I liked Veteran Sniper difficulty, the only shooting aid is reading the wind, which you can't really do in game anyway.  Overall the game play is good, but you are basically paying for a demo.  I'm pretty sure you could speed run this whole game in under an hour, and fully playing it is still only like 20 hours of game time; unless, you go back and redo the few missions over and over again to get all the challenges.  Speaking of the challenges, they are always set up so you have to do a mission at least 3, if not 4 or 5 times, to get all the challenges because they are frequently mutually exclusive.  Like, Kill X with explosive, kill X with knife, kill X...  You can only kill each target once per mission play through, so that will take doing the mission over 3 times!

The game has a design for a highly complex sniper cloak and dagger game, with a remote turret and drone, skill upgrades, different bullets and weapons to assist you in getting your kills.  However... the complexity is so under-utilised and honestly gets quite boring... I didn't actually realise I had access to the turret and drone straight away... I only equipped them for the last mission to try them out... It doesn't matter if and/or when you raise the alarm - the AI is stupid and simple to kill.  There is no variation to the guns you upgrade to... simple a better high powered and low powered rifle which you simply click-to-buy and equip.  I played only on the hardest difficulty, and was not impressed - there's simply no challenge in this game in order to clear.  I acknowledge the devs have included optional tactic awards in each one (get a few multi-shot kills/etc) however... simply add hard difficulty requirements like not being able to raise the alarm - and/or turn off autosave...

First the bad (FYI I've only played on the highest difficulty, some mechanics might change):

-As other people have mentioned there is no manual saving, there are regular check points. This can be a bit annoying if one of the challenges for a mission is something like 'complete the whole mission without loading' because you have to not die to any of the other potential issues. It also means that if you die 3/4 of the way through an enemy base, your last save might kick you back outside and all the enemies are back.

-There was no fall damage indicator, once I died from a drop of about 10 feet even with an upgrade that reduced falling damage. Stuff like climbing ledges is also very iffy.

-After planting an AP mine, I couldn't see it without getting very close, and couldn't disarm it without an upgrade, so I accidentally blew myself up with it (it was pretty funny, but would be annoying if trying to complete a no death challenge for in game rewards).

-It's difficult to tell how intelligent enemies actually are. When you are sniping, but they haven't seen you, they will go into cover (a normal thing to do), spotters and counter snipers will search for you until they see where you are, and you can snipe them as they are looking to try and prevent being found. Sometimes when you get spotted, all enemies go into a search mode, and a group will come to your last known position. However, In more open areas they use things like suppression fire, spotters, counter snipers and mortar fire to kill you or force you to move. On the highest difficulty you just have to make no mistakes, or spend a bunch of time reloading the last checkpoint, because it takes like 3 minutes for them to stop searching.

-Another thing people have pointed out is that it's not very clear what enemy vision is like. I have been able to sneak right up behind enemies only to have them turn around and shoot me in the face before I melee kill them, but there is no alarm. Meanwhile, enemies who I miss by inches with a sniper bullet will alert an entire base, who can all find my exact whereabouts instantly. It feels very inconsistent.

-One of the high tier upgrades lets you see the trajectory of things like your grenade throws before you throw them. This is something that most games give you by default. It seems like a really bad upgrade and makes using some gadgets a bit risky (if you do a bad throw, you might have to go back to the last checkpoint because now everyone can find you).

-Some mission objectives are 'sniping only/extreme range' which means you have to take a certain type of rifle that can shoot that far, forcing you to use a certain loadout. Some people might not enjoy this so it's more of a neutral point than 'bad'. 

THE GOOD:

-Sniping feels good, you get some useful special bullet types and it's easy to switch between them. Several different rifles and scopes for range and some extra bits like bipods for stability, and silencers.

-A nice selection of different weapons like assault rifles and shotguns, but you will want to earn some upgrades and get some knowledge of the missions before you try running and gunning.

-Cool and useful gadgets. Remote sniper turret which can be linked to your laser pointer, flying drone that can disable enemies and equipment. A few different throwable grenades and beacons which can be upgraded for different effects (and AP mines lol)

-Sniping areas play out like puzzles, can come back with different equipment and ammo to see how you can eliminate targets. There is usually a 'eliminate the entire base with no alarms' challenge to test you.",1665305043,1665305043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rather than rewarding exploration and experimentation, this is a completely linear game where you spend 98% of your time walking down narrow corridors or sneaking through one village after another, with invisible checkpoints that auto-save your game at times and places carefully designed to ruin your gameplay experience: When you reach a new area, if you complete an objective and after the alarm goes off. You can choose to load a previous point, but this means you go all the way back to the very beginning of that area and have to do everything all over. The only suppressed weapon available in the first map is a pistol that will only occasionally kill a guy standing still with his back turned towards you less than 4 meters away even if you squeeze off double or triple shots. If you don't kill him with the first shot, the entire world instantly knows your position and then proceed with showering you with mortars, completely oblivious to the fact that you're standing in the middle of their own damned base and there's a dozen soldiers homing in from all directions.

The graphics look good and you play a FPS sniper character. There are different contracts, some are close encounters (classic) and some are only meant for long distance (Sniper). There are 4 difficulties in total. The easiest difficulty will give you a dot to tell you where exactly the bullet will hit and the hardest difficulty is more meant for a realistic Gameplay e.g. you don't see the meters displayed when scoping. It took me 27 hours to complete the game and to get all of the achievements. In comparison to the first SGWC this one provides more variety in sniping and utility usage. If you played the first SGWC you will like this game. I do recommend getting this on sale since the normal price is quite heavy on the amount of hours you can spend to fully grind it to 100%. However, it is not a bug free game, sometimes the enemies will spot you for no reason, sometimes your stealth Gameplay will get denied by a random alarm, but hey not all games are bug free. All in all this game is fun for people who enjoy sniping, slow-mo sniper bullet tracing and a ninja based Gameplay style. (Of course you can also go full mayhem with explosives and rifles). If they do release SGWC3 I will for sure buy it (but only on sale). :)",1663458705,1663458705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most annoying would be how the enemy is able to pinpoint where you are when it wouldn't make sense for them to do so. Example I encountered: Blowing up a explosive crate with a silenced rifle on top of a tall building, one second later all the enemies knew I am on the building and rushes to the stairs. Frustrating as what's the point of doing all the cautious preparations when I just get revealed anyway. And some reinforcements spawns behind you even though there isn't a path where they would come from. Wish it would make more sense, like coming from a heli or a vehicle if there is a road. Would make the game more immersive.

Second is how bullet slow-mo removes the need to give lead to targets far away. Was shooting to lead the target, hoping for a double kill, only to see the bullet slow-mo pause the game and kill the second guy, while the first guy didn't move an inch, ruining the shot. You can't turn it off completely btw, 0.25x is the minimum.

Bringing me to the 3rd point which is why is there no manual save? The autosave happens when you complete or kill some objective; Relating to the example above, if the shot killed the second guy and hit the objective, it autosaves and you can't reload to try again, even more frustrating if the bullet slow-mo was the one that made you fail. EDIT: There is a way to choose an earlier save via ""Load Save"", allowing you to choose which autosave to load, but there still isn't any manual save feature.

Some pros would be the nice mask mode with heat vision to give you an edge against the enemy, the turret that you can attach a surpressor to tag team taking 2 enemies in quick succession or to help when your rifle isn't supressed. There's many types of bullet but I just used AP and EMP as I feel the rest made it too easy.

Wish the enemies were more unique than just spilt into heavy armored, sniper and regular types.

Apart from all that, I enjoyed the game. Completed the game playing at 2nd highest difficulty, but it is quite short with around 5 maps with lots of challenges if you're into that. Just some heads up before you get it yourself.",1661575443,1661758289,True,9,1,0.646913588047027588,0,True,False,False

I then watched a few Youtube videos and liked what I saw. 

I got the game and played through on easy mode and had a great time. 

After a break, I’ve started playing on a harder difficulty and am still having fun.

I guess I don’t understand the bad reviews. This is a fun game.

I like the game because:
1.	The world looks beautiful. The briefings are nice too … they look nice and give a sense of why you are doing what you are doing but don’t hog the screen time. Other details that are pretty and functional include the game modeling how you would leave tracks behind you in the sand as you walk, run, straif to the side, etc. and that such sign may alert patrols to your presence (or you to theirs).
2.	The guns are fun to shoot. The guns feel unique. Some missions require a long range rifle. Other missions are much better with a short range rifle. 
3.	The windage and bullet drop make shooting much more challenging. You have to figure out targets range, then dial in your scope to that range. Adjust aim for windage. Hold your breath and fire. At times you have to do this all in very rapid succession, (e.g. while covering a fleeing prisoner, or taking out multiple targets before they raise the alarm). This all makes the shooting feel much more challenging, rewarding, interesting.
4.	I like that the game has an easy shooting level (which provides a red dot where the windage and bullet drop will hit the target. And then a progressively harder game settings, to allow you to take more of these responsibilities on yourself. This makes the game approachable and fun, yet allows you to “become better” and stretch yourself if that sounds fun.
5.	I like the pacing of the game. As a sniper you have a lot of advantages and options. The game gives you a few more by providing some fun tools (e.g. binoculars, drone, remote turrets, mines, C4, etc.) This means that you can approach some missions in several different ways. You can use gadgets or not. 
6.	I like the process of doing surveillance, planning what targets to hit, in what order to avoid raising alarms, etc. I like how the game tries to balance out your advantages by giving the camps their own snipers, guys with binoculars (who can spot you and call-in mortar fire or enemy troops to investigate your position), soldiers who will raise alarm if they see you, or find a dead body, etc. Giving the targets some means to attack you increases the sense of risk, and encourages you to be stealthy and methodical. 
7.	The game is first person. This feels more immersive than third-person shooters to me. 
8.	The levels are interesting. In some cases, you have options of sneaking thru a camp and knifing every enemy up-close (if you so choose) or you can find a vantage point and take people out from a distance or mix it up. In other cases, you get to a vantage point and need to make all of your shots from 1000+ meters. I enjoyed both types of mission. I think this game supports stealth much better than some other first-person shooters.
9.	The game is a GAME. It isn’t exactly REAL. I’m ok with that because I think many of the “fake” aspects make it a more interesting game to play. That being said, I feel like the shooting feels more “real” and less “archadey” than some other shooting games. You are not constantly jumping to avoid being shot. You are not constantly spraying rounds.  In general, in this game you are methodically trying to avoid getting into a fire-fight, by stealth and planning. This isn’t a twitching button mashing type of game. I have some of those games and they can be fun too. In general, this game is not a “run and gun” game. I have some of those games too and they can be fun too. This is not a “looter-shooter” game.  I have some of those games too and they can be fun too. Even though this game is more methodical, it can have high tension and stress. I find that after a hard day’s work, some of the “faster paced” games are “too much” for me mentally. I appreciate this game’s slower, quieter, more surgical approach to shooting.

I would have liked the game to do some things a bit different:
1.	Sometimes I wanted to save and go to bed but needed to walk (in-game) to a point were saves happen. This can be a bit annoying.
2.	Occasionally climbing a rock wall and reaching for a ledge didn’t work. At one point in the game I fell a lot on a cliff, trying to enter a base from the back. This seemed a bit buggy. 
3.	I would have liked the game to be longer (I think I got about 20 hours from ~$7 which is probably fair). I’ve ended up buying the first Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 1 but haven’t played it yet. Hopefully those reviews are as misleading as they were for this one. 
4.	After you complete part of a level’s contracts, you have the option to exfiltrate. I found those menus a bit odd. It asks if you really want to level the area (without completing the rest of the contracts in the area) but I couldn’t figure out how to cancel and continue the level). It could be useful to exit an area early later in the game, if you are trying to meet some areas challenge (e.g. sneak into an area without raising any alarms and retrieve an item and sneak back out) and then skip the other things in the level (since you may have already done them). In general I just avoided exfiltrating (going to the exfill area and entering blue light area) until I was completely done. It wasn’t a big deal but it just felt a bit odd. It did mean that I had to find places to refill my ammo at times or loot corpses a bit but not too bad.
I have wondered if the bad reviews were by people who played started the game and immediately jumped into the hardest game setting. I suspect you might have a bad experience out of the gate if you do that. Or maybe they played with a game controller rather than a mouse and keyboard. I suspect that would also make the game much harder to control precisely (which is very important in this game). Or maybe they didn't know about the breath control button (which is required for stable aim at long distance). Or maybe they had an older machine that couldn’t keep up with the game processing requirements and ran into bugs of some kind. Dunno. I have run into a few situations were I was stuck in a wall or hole and couldn't get out. I have also had the game not award me with accomplishing a challenge that I completed. I have had a few situations were I couldn't stand up or crawl over something that I thought I should be able to crawl over. I have also had times when the enemy saw me when it was impossible for them to see me and shoot at and hit me (which I felt was uncool).

Is it a perfect game? No. No game is perfect. Is it one of the best immersive sniper shooters (that focuses on precision shooting and stealth) on the market today? I’d say yes. Is it fun? Yes. Do I recommend it? Yes. I’ve had a ton of fun.

Great graphics, Beautiful environments
Amazing gameplay
Not an open world (5 maps, multiple contracts)
Great performance easily playable on 2k resolution (for me)

New maps (pretty obv)
New sniper character, Raven
New narrator/control guy
Longer range maps with an additional map
Different music (again pretty obvious)

What's annoying?

I was hoping to be welcomed as "" Greetings Seeker"" by the same Handler/narrator and continue where we left off in prev title with the same old music i loved.
But instead there's new sniper and different control/handler/narrator with different music. It felt different but it was still fun.

About 3 days ago I started playing it heavily and after 21-23 hours of gameplay and all I can say is that this game is not worth it at over 10$. Some cool/fun stuff but alot of bugs around loading saves as well as gadgets and very repetitive/bland most of the time. More detailed reasons below:

PROS:
- Makes you feel like a sniping GOD

- Cool gadgets to play with

- Combines CQB stealth as well as very long range shooting very well

CONS:
- Buggy. 1) Enemies not spawning in at all. 2) Enemies spawning right on top of you. 3) Enemies suddenly not moving/patrolling anymore (after reload save game or just randomly. 4) Gadgets not working correctly or at all sometimes. 5) Enemies immediately looking at you without you giving any indication of your location. 6) Random heavy fps drops. 7) Losing newly chosen loadout when loading ""exfiltration"" save game. 8) Game doesn't autosave because ""Enemies on alert/searching"" when they are ALL DEAD

- Not alot of missions as all the regions took about 22 hours to complete on second highest difficulty (Thats includes probably 10-20 ""Reload Saves"" per region because I wanted to do without ""setting of an alarm"". Which in this game means, an enemy is startled and not dead)

- Not alot of variety as far as mission objectives and challenges go. Its always""Kill the target"" 2-3 times per region with either ""Find (item)"" or ""Destroy/Sabotage (object)"". Rinse, repeat.

- Some weapons are redundant. For example, pistols don't kill unless at very close range which can be done with throwing knives so why bother? Light snipers are mostly useless and you'll only use one because the game requires you to use it. 

- Not much replayability. Once you've completed the main objectives at every region, you have enough money to buy any weapon. And spoiler...THE ARE MOSTLY THE SAME. Main difference being the 3 ""tiers"" of sniper rifles. But every light sniper is the same as every light sniper, every medium sniper is the same as every other medium sniper etc. The only thing that can maybe be cool afterwards is the skins. But im not about to replay the game again because I got a new skin???

Some other reviewers mentioned collission mapping so I dreaded the ""good old"" farcry-style ""your bullet is blocked by that fence despite the clearly visible hole you shot through"" - I'm happy to report there was not one instance of this. If there is a clear path from you to target, you will hit it. Only exceptions are where it's a long shot and something may be above the path in the middle. This makes sense tho, the bullets don't fly straight but in a curve. Only hindered a single shot of mine tho.

The maps are quite huge and while it's not 100% open world as you get funneled through some paths connecting the ""areas"", but claiming it's ""100% linear"", as some other reviewer did, is nonsense. 

The AI is a bit inconsistent. It's never really clever, when they know where you are they rush straight to you but they shoot incredibly accurate over long distances (once I got killed by an MG wielder on afar shot contract there they were a kilometer away) but at least when they know there's a sniper they immediately duck behind cover. They're also all telepathically linked - if you shoot a guy right next to another, you get a second or so to kill the other guy and are fine, but a tiny bit longer than that and everyone in the camp instantly searches for you. And they all know the general direction from where you shot, often accurately enough to send mortars your way. 

The game gives you extra toys to play with, like a recon drone and a placeable sniper turret. But honestly bith are a bit of a waste. There are anti-drone-towers everywhere so most of the time it would come in handy, it doesn't work. The sniper turret as a quite limited range and the auto-firing mode to cover your ass while sniping simpy doesn't work. So all it could be used for is killing two guys at the same time, one by you one by the turret, but if you're fast enough you can do that by yourself without raising alarm anyway.

Like in far cry and similar games, the heavies are the bane of your existance. Unless you have a sniper with armor-piercing special bullets you have no way of killing them at sniping distance without alerting everyone. There are poison arrows that at least give you some distance, but that gets inaccurate quickly. So.. use a sniper with armor piercing bullets and a silencer. The medium one has the latter but not the former. 
(as for bullets, agile is not really useful, exploding only if you don't like being hidden, EMP has a few uses against turrets and the cockblocking radar jammer if you can't see the interface from your position. The others I didn't try, but I think the armor piercing and distraction bullets would be very useful)",1658339252,1658339252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I could have probably finished in well under 6 hours had I just gone for the kills and blown through the levels. 
The game play is very good, the graphics are superb, of course as it's CryEngine, the music is good, and I like the fact it stops once you've killed the last enemy, let's you know you can proceed safely unless you blow something up, then other soldiers may be sent to your location to investigate. 

Now some negatives: 
I bought the COMPLETE EDITION, but it's not, there are DLC's NOT included - very annoying!
The AI can be very lacking, especially when you blow someones head off and the guy at the side of him just carries on regardless, or maybe he just didn't like him and did not care lol 
The sound effects can be way OTT, especially creaky floor boards and in a scene on the last level, the helicopter was crazy noisy considering it was dead. 
Talking of the very last level, that only took 8 minutes to do  (so I  stayed on after and  sniped every enemy, still only took 20 minutes) very disappointing as you'd expect it to be the hardest and most challenging level.  
The bullet cam (same as Contracts 1) is quite basic compared to the proper Sniper games too, but it's ok.
So, I said I would recommend to other players, the caveat is: ONLY if it's on a special deal. There is no way that this game is worth the original asking price!

An addition couple of issues I remembered tonight. 
Why the hell can't we use the enemy mortar guns :(  
Also, despite upgrading my drone to use lethal darts they were never actually active, the noise to distract and the EMP worked great, but no darts, ever worked!
We should be able to destroy everything, including wooden bridges, shacks, and especially anti-drone towers, even if only briefly with an EMP!",1657575860,1657740422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The level design is kinda of a mixed bag where it's fun, but can also be kinda limited or at least seems like it's limited. You can get a good idea of how to tackle all the challenges and areas, but anything else might not even appears as an option.

One big example of a flaw in design and system is the kill cam which ensure a 1-shot-1-kill (when activated) regardless of where the bullet hits between groins and heads and which also stops time (during the bullet travel time animation) while, if the option is turned off, some challenges/moments are almost impossible to accomplish with really specific tools/bullets (like AP bullets) as enemies survives any hits other than head shot and, for some less armored, heart shots.

The stealth aspect of the game is relatively light and easy to handle. It will most likely remind you of Metal Gear Solid 3 to 5 where you can hide from 5m away in front of an enemy (without upgrades) just by being within some magical bushes layered around most of the area.

If you played the previous game, this one will feel a lot easier in a way as long range sniping feels far less stressful. In the first game, 1 shot (without a silencer) from as far as the map allowed and then enemies starts running around and hide while, in this game, a shot from 900+ meter doesn't alert the enemies as long as you don't use the loudest rifles.

Enemies can be a bit dumb, but are pretty lethal and aggressive in a fight - if they know where you are. There are a few sections where you are forced into combat, so preparing with mines/traps is a must. 

Not as realistic as Sniper Elite, but this isn't really what the game is going for here. You're playing as a super badass but kind of edgy elite sniper named Raven, who has all the highest tech that kind of just does the work for him when it comes to ranging and wind adjustment. Some of the longer ranged sniping (up to 1000m+) can be difficult, and though those function more as sniping puzzles than anything, they are just as satisfying. Watching a .50 bullet travel so far to explode a man's head in gory detail hasn't gotten old so far.

Some things are a little annoying, like how enemies behave kind of as a hive mind, and can somehow spot you when you're over a K away and still land hits with full auto rifle fire. The ""anti-drone towers"" are also pretty annoying. The game tutorialises using your drone as a spotter, yet many areas are covered by jammers and these anti drone towers making them kind of useless. Jammers can be destroyed, but the towers, to my knowledge, can't. Through the whole campaign I've had about 3 instances where I was able to use my drone to its intended effect, and not once have I been able to hack with my drone, another tutorialised feature. These aren't too effective on gameplay as you can often do the same job as the drone with a bit of recon and at longer ranges, theyre just kind of annoying.

---

- Streamlined and condensed experience. Quite a short game, can be completed in a day or two depending on the difficulty.
- If you like Cry Engine Sandbox games you'll like this game.
- Somewhat clunky movement mechanics, jumping is very floaty and odd.
- AI seems quite dated, sometimes it surprises you but you can cheese enemies very easily. Doesn't really seem like any real advancement has been made since earlier Cry Engine games from 2010-2013.
- Maps are streamlined and mostly split into connective corridors and objective zones.
- Graphics are overall quite good but you notice some assets / textures that are a not up to par in places sometimes. 
- Performance seems good.
- Stealth mechanics are pretty typical for games these days and isn't rewarding vs just sniping enemies one by one at a distance.
- Same with tactics, you can play very slow & methodically using stealth & gadgets to give yourself an advantage if you'd like but it's not very rewarding vs. just sniping everyone you see. If you like taking your time and playing very carefully you can but you'll probably get frustrated with the AI at times. The tutorial tries to introduce these to you but honestly I never felt a reason to use them.
- This game is best when you get in the zone with your sniper and just hit repeated headshots back to back from a comfy position. No gadgets or tactics, just straight up bullet slinging. It'd be even better if the bullet cams weren't repetitive and lacking brutality/punch.
- Gun customisation is sub-par & doesn't really add much to the experience. There's clearly 2 or 3 guns in each category that are the best and only ones worth using outside of messing around for fun. Very little reason to branch out with different weapons & they all seem very similar across the board aside from things like the crossbow/bow/shotguns. 
- There are gadgets to use but I hardly felt the need to use them. Often they are more of an annoyance than an aid. The best gadget is honestly the rocks you can throw infinitely with Q lol
- If you are good at FPS games you'll just steamroll through the game headshotting enemies, it's quite fun but does eventually get repetitive.
- Setting is generic but in a good way, set in one main location so the environments aren't too varied.
- Dialogue and voice acting is okay. There's very little story or cut-scenes (I think that's a good thing for this sort of game).
- The ""story"" isn't really worth paying attention to, it's basically just you assassinating key people in a war-torn middle eastern country for mysterious western actors. I think this is fine, I'm not sure how you'd have an engaging story in this kind of game without having annoying cut-scenes which would detract from the game and be a complete waste of the developers budget.
- Blood and gore effects are very ""canned"". You'll get sick of seeing the same models and effects repeatedly, other games do this better.
- Bullet cams also suffer due to the poor gore system, you'll get very tired of seeing them and eventually see them as holding you back with the frequent interruptions. 
- This game would be approx. ~40% better with an online co-op mode. Shame it's missing but probably difficult to implement on a budget in this game engine.
- Custom map/scenario modding support would be nice to have but would hurt the developers if they plan on DLC or a sequel using most of the same assets/systems so I see why that's not available.",1656546158,1656546158,True,4,1,0.566122531890869141,0,True,False,False

If you like Sniper Elite and/or the latest Hitman games, you'll love this game, not a doubt in my mind. However, if you like your FPSs with a intriguing story, characters or mystery then I'd recommend looking elsewhere - this is the story of a blank-slate man in a blank-desert nation to kill people you don't know or particularly care about. 

That said, the long range missions are very fun where you overlook a large section from 1000m+ away and try to take out the whole area without being spotted. These are alternated with ""classic contracts"" where you're in the nitty gritty allowing for some interesting stealth sections! 

There are challenges to complete in each mission that allow for a good replayability factor, however these do feel more limited when compared to, say, Hitman. Instead of unlocking interesting or fun ways to kill people by being skilful or stealthy or searching for good intel, the challenges instead focus on what ammo you use - ""kill [x] with explosion"", ""kill [x] without raising an alarm"", ""kill [x] and [y] at the same time"".

The game did introduce an interesting mechanic (that you have to play through the first level a few times to afford to unlock) in a sentry turret and spy drone. Sadly, there are just very few opportunities to use these when simply using your own sniper is much more effective (and anti-drone towers are over every mission-important area!).

All in all, it's a good fun game, but left me a little dissatisfied - if you want heavily replayable missions with lots of kill options that rewards you for being clever, patient and persistent, get Hitman. If you want a sniper game with fantastic bullet physics and the feel of being a real sniper, get Sniper Elite. If you have played both and/or want a combination of the two, this game will do you just fine.",1654787540,1654787540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The save system.

Look, I'm all for challenging YOURSELF in video games. I'm good with that, but at the same time, a game is a GAME. It's a GAME. It's NOT real skill, it's NOT vital to survival, it's NOT 'worth even doing' in a sense that it will help you get ahead in life. Sniper Contracts 1 AND 2 both fail to understand this, and having read Developer Reactions to people calling them out on their b.s., it's pretty clear to see that they also do not understand this vital truth. 

Let me explain:

Sniper Ghost Contracts 2 is better, arguably, than its predecessor in every way. It's better than the previous three games. The gunplay feels good, the maps feel... still kind of closed off in a way that shoehorns you into killing nearly EVERYONE unless you're playing on low difficulties, and the keybinds are still completely nonsensical. The graphics actually are great, and the engine finally runs in a way that doesn't stutter on my machine. 

So what's the problem?

The save system. The save system prevents me from quitting whenever I want, prevents me from saving when I screw something up on a mission I've never played, prevents me from doing things MY way in a world where TIME IS LIMITED and what I'm doing ISN'T going to get me ahead in life. I'm an adult. I have things to do. I like shooting things in the face in a video game because it's cathartic. What I don't like is redoing something a million times when I'm -experimenting- with the systems in play. 

You could argue that 'the cockup cascade,' as it is called by Yhatzee Croshaw at The Escapist, is part of the game, but... so is redoing the missions over and over to complete the challenges. Which MEANS I'd have to redo the missions over and over ANYWAYS just to complete the game to 100%, which is already a waste of my time when they could just provide more maps and content instead of making me redo stuff a thousand times. 

So at the end of the day, there is NO LEGITIMATE REASON to force me to deal with an incoming cavalry response group when trying to take out a sniper from 1400 meters because I plinked a spot two meters to the left next to the last sniper in the area IF I DO NOT WISH TO. This is, again, NOT real life. If I want to deal with that, and not have a redo, I can simply CHOOSE to do so. It's called self discipline. 

So to the Devs: Get your HEADS OUT OF YOUR BUTTS and STOP forcing players to redo stuff over and over if they don't want to. Let players challenge themselves, because at the end of the day... Your product is actually NOT important for most of, if any of, our lives. People like me who would otherwise love your game and even buy skins because of it, thus giving you more money to develop more stuff, may simply buzz off and leave you high and dry due to your disrespect of our time.

Let. People. Challenge. Themselves. In. Your. Video. Game. You do not need to force it. It is unnecessary and short-sighted.",1654020934,1654020934,False,2,0,0.478609651327133179,0,True,False,False

The game tells you the wind direction and speed, and the distance to a target (after marking with binoculars). You can either opt to play by self-calculating the trajectory of the bullet, or you can play with a dot-aim-helper that tells you exactly where the bullet will go.

This one is playable, but not worth full price...wait for 50% off or more sale...probably more.

where to start.......

The story is quite bland as are the characters, on both sides. Standard run of the mill ""brown"" bad guys, with standard run of the mill bad guy ambitions (story).

The new shooter and the Handler lack any real qualities and are completely generic.

Most of the rifles are either useless or superfluous, as are most of the gadgets and attachments. I have two rifles I use that cover everything from close to extreme.

On the second mission you are forced to use a rile that is so weak it requires a headshot to kill, and even then it sometimes fails to kill with a single shot. BTW, even the 50 BMG fails to kill from time to time--often when trying to complete a challenge.

The rifles can not be fired from the hip, unlike all the other weapons. To shoot the rifles you have to aim through the scope, which sucks if you are in a tight area, which happens when trying to complete certain challenges.

AI radio calls quite often do not match what is actually happening. AI will come looking for you, but even though they are not even close to where you were, or are, they say they have you ""in sight"", and will stay in that position/area unless you move to a different mission area.
Other times they see you and say, ""shit, it's one of ours"", which is what they say when they find dead bodies. 
Numerous times while engaged with them, I've shot one only to have them say, ""that better have been an accidental discharge""...truly amateur level work.

AI is often brain dead, and other times has magical powers that lets them detect you.....AI is basically broken

Shooting from over 1400 meters and guys with AKs INSTANTLY locate me, and shoot me.
 
Game employs artificial difficulty and other means of making the game longer. On many occasions I have spent 10 minutes meticulously surveying an area, marking every single enemy, turret, camera, fuse box etc, only to have 5 to 10 enemies magically appear from nowhere once I get down to the last enemy or two.
And then the magic happens as they immediately head straight to my position, which is 300+ meters away in the bushes.
In another mission I shot an explosive box from 360 meters using a silenced rifle...the AI alerted, did the ""we've had an explosion"" radio call, and then 6 of them ran directly to my position as if I sent them my location....and this happens a lot. Even when shooting from over 1000 meters explosions will alert the enemy and within seconds they have located you and shooting at you with unreal accuracy.

I swear to the gods, that they intentionally programmed the AI to react to the trigger pull. On many occasions I have repeatedly watched the AI go through a movement routine,  only to have that routine change at the exact instance I pull the trigger.

Other times, when alerted, the AI makes unnatural and moronic movements (glitch?)

Challenges are set up in a way that to get them all, an excessive amount of replays will be needed.

many times the game ""FORCES"" you to get head shots, and screws your progress if you miss....or from what I can tell, when the guy miraculously survives a bullet to the head.

Sometimes the up-link points are close to you, other times way off in the distance.

Dead enemy soldiers no longer have money on them.

Shooting positions are  pre-built with perfect positioning, marked with flags---totally wrecks any immersion.

AI snipers are so easy to spot and eliminate that they don't even need to be in the game.

Developers gave lines to AI cannon fodder soldiers such as one guy talking about getting his daughter a cellphone, another talking about a stray cat he took home, etc.  Seems they are trying to ""humanize"" these guys, but then put you in the situation of having to kill them for no reason other than them being in your path.
There are other pointed ""political"" comments made by you and your Handler...seems the developers are trying to make some kind of statement, but lack the actual ability to do it in a way people can understand.

Once again there are places you can't climb on or over, even though they are at the correct level and not blocked by anything.
On one mission I went in the water to sneak past a few guards. There were multiple rock ledges and a foot bridge that any competent game designer would allow you to climb up on...but not CI games...no, there is one, maybe two specific points you have to find to get out of the water.

The game has an FOV slider, which is a plus, but Underdog Studios / CI games, as they always do with pretty much everything, half-assed it as it only goes to 80.


More collect ""tokens"" requirements for upgrades, weapons and attachments...more than the 1st game.

Very linear maps.

There are already some very good reviews here breaking down the game design choices and mechanics that I find encapsulate my own experience as well, so I'll try and find something else to say.

I would add that I found the game just too short - completing the contracts themselves will keep you busy for 20-30 hrs, depending on difficulty and which Challenge you're trying to complete for more $$$.  The longevity of the game seems to have been designed to just be replaying these contracts and completing other challenges that are incompatible with a single play-through (e.g. Challenge 1: kill your target in an office; Challenge 2: kill your target with explosives - you can't do both in one attempt).  The only story seems to be (mild spoiler) [spoiler] ""It's not about how many bad-guys you kill, it's about how friends named Alex you make along the way"". [/spoiler]

How a base becomes alerted to your presence is also very arbitrary.  Seemingly, any explosion from any of the many, many volatile assets around any of the bases is immediately blamed on a sniper nearby and the entire base with be looking to the surrounding landscape with binoculars like it's just turned into a bird-watcher's convention.  In contrast, given no enemies within a relatively small distance, putting a bullet through a fuse box is immediately inspected by the enemy, but they must conclude that the large round hole in the panel is a blown capacitor or something because there's no alert.

Lastly, and this is just irritated me: if you're going to explicitly mention, in a Sniper game, what the world record for the longest kill is and then never give the player an option to kill anyone further away than about 1,500m, you're a cruel and evil game designer.

- ""new game"" deletes your save permanently; dont let siblings or friends play this game on your steam account
- enemies dance more than they ""look at"" something broken making hitting them a game of chance. dont break something as a distraction it will make the game harder
- dont miss. EVER. it will alert every guard on the map and attract them to your position for some reason. doesnt matter if you use a silencer or not. if you *miss* you are spotted. if you hit everything is fine though. the logic here is trash
- sometimes you just miss. there is no helping it. a perfect 1200 alignment, 1200 distance, perfect on-scope aim. miss. the game is just designed to be a pain in in the hind
- every boss has super-human health. every. single. one. you will never one-shot them.
- enemy snipers have the benefit of instaspotting you. for some reason they dont need to check if you are a friendly or not. they see you, you are spotted. again this alerts the entire map to your location
- every ""kill x by explosion"" or anything other than a bullet requires explosive ammo (and two hits because super human bosses) because despite every level having tens of explosives no actual target will get even remotely close to them except one which makes this challenge utterly pointless and annoying because you are literally repeating the old gameplay but with different bullets
- everything you do takes forever. loot, pick up body. pseudo realistic maybe. fun? no.
- you cannot move when you interrogate or ambush someone. during this forced cutscene of 20 seconds you are an open target and visible to everyone. if only the game would let you drag the target back just one meter into the bush.. but nope. fun game...
- when you are eventually and unavoidably spotted, every enemy will instantly know where you are within a split second because calling for your friends is naturally your #1 priority over, say, running for your life to avoid a bullet. gee. its like these developers studied real life. stunning. at least a game such as metal gear had the decency to add some radio chatter giving you a chance to correct a mistake (i.e. shooting radio or killing them before they had the time to relay anything) but not in this game
- whenever you replay a campaign to grab more challenge points and achievements you have to restart the game over and over because ""restart mission"" is so damn bugged it will *sometimes* put you back at the end of the campaign instead of where you just were. even if you were at the very beginning. dogcrap

its a piece of shit game with devs or (lets not blame programmers) product managers who do not respect the players time at all. the only fun aspect of this game is the idea of it. not worth the money. buy on sale if you must.

also yes i lost all my save progress because of the last point in my list which irritated me so much because of the long forced loading times of exiting and reloading the campaign instead of simply ""reloading the map"" (which is bugged, see the last point above) i accidentally new-game'd and lost all save progress adding salt to the injury. you know because its fun for CI to kick a man while he's down

While sniping is a HUGE part of the game don't think that you're left with nothing else in your arsenal to use. The maps are HUGE and there's a lot of replayability in how you approach each contract or even each area. Graphics are fantastic and the world design is phenomenal. Sound design is fantastic for weapons. Music is mediocre at best. Same soundtrack over and over and over while exploring. Would have been nice for the devs to mix maps and the music up a bit. Still, it isn't overbearing. 

However, don't let it be said that I never said there were no issue. The AI and their sometimes idiotic approach to ""finding"" you is ridiculous at times. Even worse on the harder settings. ""That better not have been an accidental discharge!"". Really, bro? Seems the AI can ""find"" you regardless of how quiet you take some missions. While I like the AI will gather and rush your last known position, they then scurry around completely neglecting any and all bushes you may be hiding in. Absurd sometimes. Sniper Elite series does the SAME THING as well. Maybe it's the devs giving you some breathing room. I don't know. Seems cheap. 

The AI also seems to be able to find your EXACT location as well. Wha? A SILENCED shot from 400 meters and you know where I am instantly? C'mon. The AI and their comments is about my only gripe. Your handler and coms are MUCH better than Contracts 1. I also love how in the tutorial, if you go through the cams, you'll find the MASK from Contracts 1. What happened there? 

All in all, CI Games gets better with every new installment of game they make. I still LOVE Ghost Warrior 3 and the open world design and world, buggy, explorable places, etc. Wish they would have kept that vibe going in Contracts 1&2 but they're still great games. 

So, moving forward, if the devs ever read these ""reviews"" a couple things I know gamers that enjoy their games would LOVE to see done. 
1. Make the AI SEARCH EVERYTHING if they're coming after you.
2. Record at least 200 lines of dialogue for these guys/ladies. The same conversations and coms get OLD quick. 
3. FIX the AI. The ability to find you IMMEDIATELY after taking silenced shots at great distances is bs. 
4. Make it so we can CLIMB and scale more of the environment. I love how there's multiple approaches but why can't I climb the boxes to get to the top of a bulding instead of using the ladder? Or, why can't I jump up on boxes/items to get behind a bad guy instead of using an obvious approach? 

I actually have played and finished Contracts on the PS5 and seeing the game take a nice discount on Steam I figured I'd jump back in and use this 3080 to make it shine. Man, does the world look breathtaking with everything cranked up to max. One of the best looking games so far this gen. They really did an amazing job with the world design. I can't mention that enough. A solid purchase if you like FPS that require a bit of tactical breathing room and some thinking and patience.",1653374942,1653374942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Due to the lack of content I would recommend to buy it in sale (got it for 50% off which was a good deal). There are many challenging bounties that will require to play each mission/contract multiple times. You can't save, which is OK as long as you won't get stuck between some simple map elements like branches or even stones. Then you have to go back to your last auto-saved checkpoint which can be really frustrating.

The negative:
It's sad that you neither need the skill-points nor the weapons and attachements that you can unlock during the whole game. You can buy pretty early the 'best' sniper-rifle with the most advanced sniping scope. The 2nd weapon (e.g. AK47) is not needed at all, since the silenced pistol will instantly kill every nearer enemy with a single headshot. Bows, machine guns, C4, mines, grenades, drones, decoys and all that stuff is NOT needed to succeed any mission. You don't even need to hide the corpses (in opposite to Hitman), since the bots got pretty straight forward walking-routes and most of them are just standing still. There are only a few types of enemies & not many stuff to interact with.

The positive:
It runs absolutely smoothly even with the highest graphic settings and looks awesome. It's fun to experiment with the difficulties. As said, there are challenging bounties and some items to collect. If you like ""game completion"", so playing the same part multiple times with different targets, its really fun even if it's just ""one big map"" with a handful of contracts.

First of all the actual sniping is good.  That's obviously important since the main focus of the game.  In this regard the game is way better than the Sniper Elite 4 sniping which is hot garbage by comparison, and is a great balance of realism and accessibility.

Unfortunately, the actual sniping portions are about 10% of the game, and the rest of it is you moving through enemy territory to get into position for these shots.  You can choose to move through these areas stealthily (Either completely passive, bypassing enemies peacefully or killing them silently), or in open combat.  Neither option is fun, and the second option is broken and unfun on higher difficulties. 

Before we even get to those things, though, we have to discuss just how poorly this game's mechanics match with its presentation.  Given everything you're presented this game screams ""open world"".  And maybe not completely open in the Skyrim or Arma sense, since the missions are contained to their own sectors, but it is, in fact, the complete opposite of that.  Moving from one sniping position to the next is actually borderline completely linear, and you learn this very quickly by the copious amounts of invisible walls that exist.  If they don't want you to go somewhere, you're not going there.  And it's not even this alone, but the way in which this is presented that becomes downright frustrating within minutes of starting the game.  These walls exist everywhere, even in mind-boggling places like an inches high rock on the edge of a path that signals to you ""Don't go past here"".   In most situations,  you have a very narrow path down which you are expected to navigate, and creativity is neither welcome nor allowed.  You will use the few obvious places they want you to sneak through, or engage in combat.  Unfortunately neither of those things are terribly fun.

Sneaking is pretty bog standard.  You have a few gadgets like drones and distractions that help you position enemies and their attention where you want it.  But apart from that, it's all walking, running, crawling and crouching your way through obviously positioned boxes and patches of grass.  The lack of actual open world exploration really hurts here.

The non-sniping combat is equally unexciting, and on higher difficulties it's not a terribly vital option, as you quickly become overwhelmed with the sheer number of deadly accurate enemies, mortars, etc.  I'm actually somewhat ok with this, as a true sniper would not be prepared to deal with an entire outpost full of enemies Rambo-style.  Once again it's the way that this is presented that makes it truly disappointing.  Half the time, you kill an enemy, even with a suppressed weapon and the rest of the base magically knows not only that something has happened, but exactly where you are.  Then you've got mortars dropping on your head with pinpoint accuracy even though no one actually laid eyes on you.

Movement is also really bad.  Crouch down and all of a sudden you're completely incapable of stepping up a 3-inch high rock until you fully stand up again.  Bizarre design choice.  You also are incapable of leaning one way or another, a feature that has existed in games for well over a decade.  More modern mechanics like being able to move in gradients between walking and running or between crouched and fully standing are also sadly missing.  It's not the worst movement ever, but it feels very off.

Unfortunately the character customization and loadout customization adds little to nothing.  Suppressors are key to success at higher difficulty levels but are mysteriously missing from half of the guns, even when their real life counterparts are capable of suppression.  The game makes an odd distinction between light, medium and heavy rifles, often seemingly without any clear, logical reason.  The secondary and sidearm weapons are equally problematic in the same areas - if the weapon can't be suppressed it's borderline worthless, etc. 

 The skill trees are even worse and feel very tacked on.  Most of these are bog-standard % increases in stats like stamina, health or concealment.  A wasted opportunity.

It's a real shame that most of the game is taken up with the worst parts of it.  As I said, the sniping is actually quite satisfactory and well done.  But when you spend twenty minutes navigating through frustratingly stale and claustrophobic corridors to reach the next sniping area, with weapons that are pretty boring... it really detracts from the experience in a negative way.

The problem here is that it's not the execution of the game that's lacking, but the foundation of the design decisions.  If it were buggy, it could potentially be fixed through patching.  If it were just a balancing issue of weapon numbers, etc a patch could fix that too.  But it's the design decisions from the ground up that just don't jive with the kind of game I was looking for.  I can't recommend it, but I'm sure there will be plenty of people who will like it.",1652968214,1652968214,False,133,7,0.850630402565002441,7,True,False,False

[b] TLDR; I recommend this game. Split into two mission categories, you’ll get somewhat of a variety. The graphics are better than average and you’ll have a blast on your first playthrough. [/b]

Sniping is a difficult job. First, you must find a suitable observation post to spot your target and that perfect opportunity to shoot the target. You’ll then have to calculate the distance and account for bullet drop and wind speed. Even then, you’ll have to handle a possible enemy counterattack that’s looking for the man who shot their officer. But when you take that shot and kill your target, you feel alive. You relax, knowing that one part of your mission is over. Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 tries to recreate that feeling of a professional sniper.

Being the second game in the series, Contracts 2 uses old and new ideas to add variety to the game. You play as Raven, a professional sniper tasked with collapsing a regime by neutralizing high-value targets. With the help of your handler, you will be able to liberate a whole country. The game can be divided into two mission types, classic and long shot. Classic missions are the old mission types from the original game. This is where you have to traverse a large map to neutralize your targets and either close or long-range. You’ll have to sneak past multiple patrols and enter deep into enemy lines. Long shots contracts are new to the series and force you to shoot your targets at long distances, usually greater than 1000 meters. Here, you will experience less of an enemy presence, completing objectives from far away with well places shots by your rifle. 

Most maps feel the same, as they are either in some kind of forest or the desert. The graphics look realistic, but not as realistic that I think I’m in another world or place. There is also some dismemberment, causing enemies to lose their heads, arms, and legs. It looks not bad, especially when you get the slow-motion camera. The enemy’s AI is a bit advanced, reacting to dead bodies and investigate suspiciously thrown rocks. The enemy variety, however, isn’t as different. You can easily split the enemies into three categories: Grunts, Heavies, and Snipers. There are officers in the game, but they aren’t very useful unless you want to find ammo or equipment. However, the ammo can be easily acquired off dead bodies and you will most likely have all the equipment you need when you enter the map. There is also minimal replayability, with the only reasons going back into previous maps being challenges and bounties, which don’t give enough money and are only finished for intelligence that unlocks new guns.

Speaking of guns, the firearms that you can unlock and customize are not bad. First, you have your snipers. You can either go stealthy with three types of snipers, with an integrated suppressor, or bring down a building with a 50 BMG. What I like about the snipers, especially the 50 BMG, is that their standard rounds hit differently. Meaning that you do not require AP rounds with the 50 BMG to kill a Heavy enemy. Special rounds are just as important as the gun you choose. Each round does something unique, which helps in different situations. However, I’ve only relied on two special rounds. SABOT, which is just “click on the head and he dead,” and EMPs, which deactivate electronics and vehicles. The rest of the rounds, with some exceptions for AP rounds, aren’t useful at all. Moving on from snipers, you then have your secondary weapon and pistols. Secondary weapons are only useful when you are going loud, with no stealth in mind. Pistols are much better, capable of easy use during stealth and loud. All guns can one-shot grunts and snipers in the head.

Finally, there is equipment and the forgettable skill tree. Equipment is very useful, especially the drone and sentry. The sentry acts as a second sniper, which is useful or double kills. Just make sure to unlock the suppressor for a more quiet approach. The drone is one of the most useful items in the game, capable of easy tagging of enemies, and disabling both humans and electronics. However, the excessive use of anti-drone towers in ALL maps causes the drone to be only useful in mission areas, especially in classic contracts. So, don’t think you’ll be able to sit in a bush flying the drone around everywhere. The rest of the equipment, especially medkits, is useless. I have not had any success with C4, mines, or boosters. Medkits, which I consider the most useless thing in the game, don’t even come into mind most of the time. You either die to an enemy push, causing a game load, or you survive the encounter and let regen handle it. Then, we have the skill tree. The skill tree can easily be forgotten about, as it is tucked away in the corner. I only realized the skill tree existed after I finished the first two missions. It is somewhat useful, however, allowing the upgrade of your equipment, and the unlocking of armor. I recommend not forgetting about the skill tree, as it will help in further missions, especially the castle.

In conclusion, Contracts 2 is a not bad game. Is it better than the first game? Maybe. The price tag is a bit high, especially with the lack of missions. Though, if you’re craving a good modern sniper game, be my guest and buy it. But maybe wait for more missions or a patch that decrease the amount of anti-drone towers. I recommend playing in the hard difficulties, as it makes the game harder and more pleasurable when you hit a headshot.",1627418607,1651720268,True,12,0,0.636367976665496826,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- The game can be challenging at times.
- Sniping is fun, and it can feel very rewarding to hit a pixel perfect 1.4k meter shot or a double kill.
- Doing challanges can be challenging
Cons:
- Once you get the hang of the game it becomes super easy.
- Sneaking and enemy spotting becomes a joke with really dumb AI and your mask ability that just wall hacks everything around you. The second you step into a bush you become invisible. Silencers are super strong.
- Raising alertness feels pretty akward, you can shoot an enemy 50m in front of another in broad daylight and that's ok, since enemies line of sight and such feels really random. You can also kill someone thats standing 10m away as long as they're not ""looking at eachother"".
- The hardest part of the game is the beginning. Once you learn how it works they don't really ramp up the difficulty in following missions. And your abilities make you way stronger then the next level difficulty spike. Since the AI is pretty dumb and I don't need to kill all these small outposts, sneaking around the map just leaving everyone up is really easy.
- While you can farm challanges which some of them are a bit difficult, I really hate to handicap myself just so I can feel challanged. I don't know how the game feels like in lower difficulty but maybe they could have added some missions to be only passable with a specific challange or something. I just don't like that I have to impose this on myself.
- Part of a stealth game is finding different approaches to get to your target. However the movement in sgwc2 is rather bland, with almost anything that's not flat ground or have a ladder/climbing spot is impassable. Which means you follow a very direct route each time, and picking your stealth route doesn't feel any special.",1651598010,1651598010,False,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Either the game isn't that good, or I'm no longer into stealth shooters.
Maybe after playing games like Skyrim, Fallout and RDR... this game feels jarringly like it's on rails.
A stream of repetitive go in, scout, eliminate guards, get to sniping position, kill bad guy, exfiltrate, rinse, repeat.
Sure, it's 25 hours of gameplay, maybe.
But it feels more like 5 times 3 hours of the same game.

- Sluggish and stiff combat. The gunplay compared to other MW shooters feel extremely child-like and do not feel the recoil and the weight of the gun. The guns other than the sniper are a pain to shoot with.

- Questionable graphics. (2K, Very High settings) The overall graphics of the game fits the year 2013~2015 at best. The textures are a mess, the AA, just like in SGWC1 is a joke, and the jagged edges in the trees just look bad. 

- The story doesn't have anything to say and is super forgettable. The characters feel rushed too.

As it stands , if you like some stealth, sniping and glorious killcams this is the one to go for. Just keep in mind that you will be replaying missions to get more challenges done thus earning more money and tokens, if you don't like that concept and want a more story driven mode take a look at the older SGW games.

Also, do not bother with the DLC, you WILL NOT need it. It is too expensive for what it is imo.

It's really focus on stealth and sniping which is good.
You do need to run a decent GPU if you want the draw distance and enjoy the cryengine fully. (some minor lighting glitches when proning) and map quick travel glitches can happen, it will be permanently broken until the end of the contract.

The games graphic on max settings are gorgeous, no issues with the draw distance.
The sound is really good and the bullet cinematic is fun but not as diverse as sniper elite.
Some weapons mods doesn't really make sense especially for shotguns.
Game doesn't really emphasis on the kit diversity and making choosing a weapon quite important. Thus you are free to play how you want but at the same time you won't have much reasons to change your kit once you're happy with what you have.
The mechanics of stealth are nice, not too hard not too easy.

What I hate the most is how useless the secondary turret and the drone are. Too many jammers, super short range of the drone. Honestly don't add a drone if the map is full of indestructible jammers. Ghost recon did a better job with drone then this.
The secondary turret range for the long snipe is basically useless despite the bullet being able to reach that far. It serves no purpose close range or long range.
The gas mines are also pointless the NPC doesn't always get knock out by it.
A lot of items really lack purpose for a sniping game, unless the idea is to not be discreet and gun and shoot like a rambo.
Sniper choices are limited and they are bolt action would be good to see at least some semi-auto. The special bullets carry capacity is really low. And a lot of them are barely useful. The only one that has the highest use is the AP round.

Another issue (which will spark hate and debate) is the auto-save features, which ain't working well. Yes, I know some people hate ""save scum"" but that's a single player game and people have the right to tackle however they want their gameplay. Each their own honestly.
Sometimes you just want to try the water on a base and shoot a round to see how the AI behave and patterns. But you might be sent back to 5min to 30min of your progress. Because the AI has a pattern and no randomness the manual save really has no impact. Thus I don't see a real issue of implementing the manual save at least on easy and normal. For harder difficulty I understand for the challenge.

Update:
I posted my initial review because I was upset, mainly with the save points. The good thing is there are load points but there isn't a manual save which would be incredible to have. After playing the game for some hours and giving it a chance, I realized that it is a fun game. It is definitely worth the 30 I paid.

I've played Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 1 and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was a unique experience for me. This one offers the same model of fun engaging sniper assassination gameplay with incremental improvements over the first one!

The visuals were truly stunning, one of the best games I've laid eyes on. 

The maps were as great. Some quite expansive and even making it time-consuming to navigate on foot. I would've liked some sort of vehicle navigation aside from major fast travel points that skipped huge parts of the map. Other maps were tiny and offered unique shooting points over incredibly long distances. This extreme range shooting was the most major improvement that gave 2 a distinct feeling from contracts 1. It's what makes this game a deep sniper game. Plus, it's what the fans wanted along along!

Weapons were mostly the same, except with the addition of a bow. I personally rarely used it yet but it could be a useful addition.

The new character is Raven with a new handler. I like the name and the mask along with it but I didn't find the British accented handler gripping. I would've had a deeper relationship and story that highlighted the relationship raven was questioning. More on that and a climax between the two would've offered an interesting story. Otherwise, it's simply Raven doing what he's told.

Overall I'd give it an 7/10

The game is interesting, but it is hard to ignore some aspects of it like all the bugs and performance.
Bugs are rather plentiful and can get quite annoying when I have to restart the entire mission or checkpoint because of it. 
Often you or the NPC's will get stuck in the terrain (or even under). 
During a mission you can be instructed/given directions to find and item, even though you already found it etc.
Moving over tiny little humps, rocks etc. in the terrain can be a nightmare.
Wind affecting bullet (a lot) inside buildings?

Checkpoints are all over the place. When you load, all enemies will be alerted, even if they were calm before, or often happen at a very bad time, like when you just got spotted. 
Some challenges can bug out and not unlock. Especially fun to do those ""Clear the entire base without alarm"" and it fails even though no alarm went off.
The performance of this game I would say is not good/optimized enough. Store page recommends 7700, 16GB & 1070. I got 9900k, 32GB and 3080ti (1440p), yet the average is about 120fps and dips all the time in the 80's.
It is very noticeable and feels stuttery.

The game/story is very short. Just a few missions with lots of ""Challenges"" to artificially make the game longer. To complete them all you must replay the same mission again and again. 
Otherwise, the game is very interesting and stealth is fun. Very similar to Sniper Contracts 1, even the bugs.

Well, that's a loaded question and my answer is this: it depends both on how much jank you're willing to put up with and whether or not you can get it on a sale. This game, much like its predecessor, still has no manual save system, guards that can near-instantly alert everyone in an area if not killed quickly (which becomes a problem on the contracts that require long-range shots, since travel time is a thing here - if you want to hit a moving target with a bullet or an explosive you'll need to shoot several seconds before you intend for the shot to hit), a limited number of ways to kill targets and complete objectives, janky challenges... I could go on, honestly, but the bottom line is this: it's probably not worth $40, but if it's on sale and you can put up with a lot of jank, then I'd recommend it.

I'm only on level 3 and have spent 16.6 hours playing this game.  Well worth your time if you want to sink your teeth into a sniper shooter that sometimes plays like COD if you can survive the close-range engagements for more than 3 seconds.

[u]I. What i liked about Contracts 2[/u]

1. Option to switch off all HUD elements 

2. Having one button for crouch and prone - press the button and crouch, hold it and  go prone. it's amazing!

3. Map design - open maps on which you can decide in what order you want to complete your tasks/contracts

4. collectibles are few and easy to find - no extra playthrough is needed to get everything.

5. sniping is fun and enjoyable

[u]II. What i didn't like about Contracts 2[/u]

1. performance could be better - i get an average of 90 frames with some dibs down to 65 frames on medium settings.

2. not enough graphic settings - you can't go lower then medium and the settings are very limited - you can adjust some settings in the cfg file which not always works as intended

3. fish eye effect above 70° fov - in game only adjustable to max. of 80° - if you want to change the fov to 90° you have to add a line in the cfg file

4. game is buggy (not game breaking)

5. game is censored in germany - just fyi german friends - pro tip: get someone to gift it to you from another country ;)

there are some other points but these are the most important in my opinion! i wrote my full feedback down and send it to the devs. hopefully they will take my suggestions seriously.",1637401315,1643970216,True,1,0,0.51827472448348999,0,True,False,False

I held off buying at release due to the issues (performance) I had with the earlier titles, but it's been worth the wait! Apart from a couple of annoying missing features, that were in previous titles, it's a great game.

The first SGW was plagued with bugs and issues on the Xbox. SGW Contracts ran terribly on my AMD PC, but SGWC2 runs much more smoothly (100-180fps on very high settings with a 6900xt & 5800x). The aspect that I like most about this one is that there is a lot more opportunity to snipe than in the previous titles, and you can approach missions much more easily and obviously than before. I like that there are classic maps, which are more contained than the 'long shot' maps, and I hope they expand on this formula going forward. I played on the hardest difficulty, dead eye, I believe. The sniping mechanics are relatively challenging, but once you get a hang of them, it's straight forward. Personally, I think the game is much more fun on the harder difficulties. You can't just shoot out fuse boxes with enemies near by like on the easier difficulties, otherwise enemies will be alerted, so you have to plan accordingly - much more realistic.

My biggest disappointment with game? It's pretty trivial in the grand scheme of things, but you cannot deploy the bipod like you could in the previous titles, and you also can't, from what I have played so far, reload while ADS. These two issues took me out of the game on many an occasion, from an immersion perspective. Please bring them back.

I loved the addition of the sniper turret, a turret that you can place on the ground, select targets via the binoculars, and snipe targets from a distance to setup really nice sync shots, like you can in Ghost Recon Wildlands.

Wish list:
- Bring the bipod back (properly!)
- Reload while ADS - you can make this a perk you have to unlock, or just allow it from the start.
- I would love the ability to place my sniper rifle down on the ground from a prone position, using the bipod and lie next to the rifle with my binoculars out, with a seamless transition between the two - this would really add to the immersion.

If like me, you held off buying this, definitely pick it up now, while it's on sale! Play on dead-eye, but play the tutorial for a good amount of time, until you have perfected the sniping mechanics.

Long range engagements like this game provides are seldom seen in military FPS not only today. but even in the past.  The nice thing about this title is that it is not rooted in the milsim genre like other games that provide that sniper itch, and even the casual fan of sniping can play effectively with the aids provided.  These aids are also able to be turned off so that if you become comfortable with the calculations necessary to hit that 1500 meter shot, you can do so which provides the true experience of a one man sniper team having to spot and judge shot placement.

I had played other stealth games before like the Hitman series, and it truly feels like you're playing a combination of regular Hitman 2 and the Hitman 2 sniper mode. Amazing combination in my book.

In this game, your goal is to take out targets, gather data, rescue hostages, and (hopefully) not get spotted. I feel like they did an awesome job making the sniping realistic. You have to take into account distance and wind speed in order to aim correctly, and I feel that not a lot of games that use snipers really do that, at least not in my experience. They also made it totally optional whether you go through the levels stealth, or if you want to go loud.

Another thing I really enjoyed, is there are both long range missions, and close range missions. Having both really changed things up, and made the game a lot more interesting. And even when you do long range missions, you still have close range enemies nearby that you have to be careful of when maneuvering between targets. For close range missions, you have a wide variety of weapons, equipment, and tools in your disposal to help you. One of my favorite things to use is the drone. You can hack camera boxes with it from a distance, all without moving from your perch. You can take out targets with the poison darts, and you can survey your area without moving a muscle. Do be careful though, enemies can spot your drones and be alerted.

Honestly, I never really encountered a downside to this game. The only thing I can think of is when you're moving bodies to hide them, the dropping physics are a little whack. They don't really like to land where you try to place them, so you end up having to pick them up and drop them a few times. It isn't the end of the world, but I can see how it could be quite annoying to some players.

In short, I really enjoyed this game. I 100% would recommend this to anyone who is even slightly interested in playing it. To anyone who buys it, I really hope you enjoy it :)",1643421769,1643421769,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

High tech military infiltration, sabotage and assassination game. The game is composed with mainly 3 phases: 
Chose your gears.
Sneak, infiltrate, silent kill when necessary or to buff all the challenges (They are a lot. A bit in the Hitman way). Till you arrive to a platform where you can try your perfect shot. 
Google, mark potential targets, observe them, take your time then hold your breath and shoot.  1 shot 1 kill is highly preferred if you play on hard difficulty. 

Beautiful sceneries and visuals composing big maps. Can also be improved with Reshade to add Ray Tracing for a little plus that makes a difference and without any frames drop with a recent GPU at least. Smooth to the perfection.

Music and sounds are also excellent. The sound can disappear at time during certain in game loads but for a couple of seconds only. Just need to wait during that time and it is all ok. It generates a short immersion loss at worst.

All is well done. Shooting is at the same time slow paced and intense. The slow mo on nice shots provides satisfaction and entertainment, It is gore as well.

Climbing is a bit messed up. Especially from the water to a platform. No possibility to grab somebody by the foot. Could be better here definitely to take down.

One important grief. Only checkpoints. No manual saves. That is boring at times, frustrating. The game save frequently but not always when it could be appreciated. And it may oblige to redo some kills to progress.

Despite the flaw with the save system, it remains highly recommendable for who like stealth and sniping games in a modern warfare environment.",1642350459,1642911073,True,4,0,0.57703930139541626,0,True,False,False

* Has elements of playing sniper

Cons:
* 90% of the time you fight at the distance of <50 meters.
* 90% of areas end up in the format: spook enemies, then kill em 1by1 as they come towards you
* During actual long-range missions, enemies shoot their AKs and miniguns with super accurate precision. Sniper rifles are overrated.
* Tons of bugs in my experience
* Collectible search is effectively pixel hunting in a buggy environment.
* Maps are effectively several instances with long walks inbetween that are organized in a maze. I'd prefer loading screens. They are faster and easier.
* Instance maps themselves are either pipe style or maze style. Really, had to spend like 15 minutes to find where to go once...

After finishing SGWC1 to 100% I picked up this game as a continuation of the experience. And it did everything the first game did but better. Despite the list of bugs I encountered, (see below) the combat felt more combative, the threats felt more threatening, the strongholds were stronger and the snipes were sniper. Like the AI got a major update, for once feeling a bit more on the “I” than the “A”. I’ve got full blown, organised search parties sent after me which kicked my ass. Suppressive fire was also times way more effectively and vehicles are actually used. Needless to say this game rocked me with its gameplay and wrecked me on multiple occasions. However, it almost always felt fair because, barring the list of bugs, I just got outplayed. The contracts themselves also felt more diverse. From limited time windows, to odd movements, to specific triggers to, full blown rescue missions, to ambushes, to NPCs whose survival is mission critical you almost don’t notice recycled content from the first game. The story itself is also a lot more coherent this time around, but I won’t spoil too much. The Handler aka Base aka Control aka Alex ;) is another major improvement. He feels like the spotter you don’t have when he clenches alongside you during mission 2, gives heads up during mission 3 or when he becomes wholesome during mission 6 … or when he berates the shite out of you for killing the informant (which you totally deserve btw.).                                                      The graphics are self-explanatory. Before scrolling down to the reviews you’ve seen the screenshots so I have nothing to add. (The new mask makes me look like moth-man but that’s neither here nor there.) So lastly there’s the music. This time around the music is actually worth it, being in tune with the situation being creepy, quiet or heroically dramatic where appropriate. The combat music is what I can only describe as an upbeat military séance, which sounds weird but is oddly appropriate for the situation.

Now with all I have described this game could be a solid 10/10, however I’m only giving it 8.5/10 and don below is the reason why.


Small personal gripes: (-0.5 pts.)

-They removed the “INTERROGATOR 3000” aka the flashbang from the first game.
-Finding the jammers on your first play through is still way too annoying.
-There is no online mode.
-Master-god-of-combat-and-weapons that you are you still cannot drive vehicles and man mortars.
-The checkpoints are too inconsistent.


The list of bugs: (-1 pt.)

*Region 1:
-When zooming in with a sniper, the white bars indicating wind might disappear on singular levels.
-The 3 Trucks that can be sent after you during Paynes contracts can run into objects, in which case they’ll just reverse and go forward again, getting effectively stuck.
-Collected med kits and adrenaline shots do not always get shown in your UI at first once the stack limit is reached. Switching the item around fixes it though.
-Either I’m really smooth brained or you can’t set up the bipod on heavy snipers. I can buy it but in game it tells me that there is no accessory on it. (after 50 hours I think this is a constant bug)
-In the small village by the lake, upon loading a save, half a foot patrol has bugged himself 30meters underground whilst his buddy stood around, not knowing what to do. (South-East)

*Region 2:
-Hitting the grenade on a soldiers belt alerted all enemies to my position even though I was on the other side of the contract area. (I was using a silencer)
-In the woods near the pumping station some pebbles behind patrol points are impassable without jumping, blowing your cover.
-During interrogation, Khalils part of the conversation was instantly skipped, causing raven to do a weird monologue whilst hugging Khalil.
-EMPing a tank at the citadel entrance can cause you to be in combat indefinitely, making you unable to generate saves.
-AI pathing around the upper fort near the entrance is weird, especially around the tunnels and the turrets.
-Once engaged, Hellström constantly knew my location even after 5 minutes of hiding, making an interrogation impossible.
-Killing Hellström and then loading a game has a chance of making him un-searchable, firmly soft locking that timeline.
-When equipping a sniper on the elevator, physics can get floaty, greatly restricting your movement.
-Gasing Nakamura with a decoy trap makes her unlootable. Send help, I'm stuck in the basement.

*Region 3:
-I’ve completed the gold challenge to free the prisoner and kill everyone without raising the alarm but I haven’t got the “Karma” achievement.
-Dragovic is running around with his patrol. But if you kill some of them and then load a save, he may get stuck in his phone-call animation on loop.
-After one miss, my thrown knifes have an uncanny tendency to disappear.

*Region 4:
-Reaching the north-west exfil point after retrieving the chip triggers nuke related dialouge.
-Against MC Nally the rival can alert the rest of the camp via radio.
-Just south of the freight office there are stairs leading up. Engaged enemy soldiers can run up these, take the turn too tight and fall down, dealing fall damage and ultimately killing the soldier if left unattended for too long.
-Double kills with explosive sniper rounds does not get tracked properly.
-Auto-tagging with “target tracking plugin” and “environment chip is inconsistent. I sometimes run around a corner in mask mode and get meleed by an untagged soldier. (not factoring in jammers)
-At the port, during long range combat from outside, singular soldiers may run out into the wilderness and stay engaged with whatever sticks and stones they’re finding, even when the rest of the base has long since reverted back to normal.
-Paradoxically, once alerted in general, decoys and thrown stoned don’t have an effect on enemies anymore.
-Starting the contract in the palace and then leaving still makes the handler say something to the effect of: “strong military with turrets”, even though I just got done killing everyone in sight.

*Region 5:
-On approach to the airfield the patrols spawn in depending on your position. This works fine when approaching from the previous OP just when starting the mission in the ruined village they can backstab you like some Brutus wannabes.
-On the airfield, the triple kill shot against Taj and his heavies is only possible with the cinematic cam. I’ve tried it multiple times with and without bullet cam enabled and had a 100% vs. a 0% result.
-Killing Taj triggers enemies to descend on you whether or not that kill was actually witnessed by anyone.
-On the airfield, the golden challenge is impossible. I’ve killed everyone in that airport and got neither a fail nor a clear on the challenge. 11 tagging bullets, 11 explosive bullets and blowing up Tajs car did not change the situation.
-On the airfield OP some small debris to the right (looking at the airfield) is, despite its appearance, impassable without jumping, compromising your movement during combat.

*Region 6:
-The Butcher does not get alerted alongside the rest of the base.
-After killing the butcher, I became unable to loot corpse until I left the mission area.
-When stealing the cell phone, enemies have an uncanny ability to sense the corpses of their patrol buddies through walls.
-When stealing the research notes, placing C4 as a distraction at the area entry and detonating it right after obtaining the notes has a chance to alert every one of YOUR position. (Neither camera nor enemy inside the temple interfered. 
-The wood on outposts has a chance to become impenetrable to AP bullets, greatly impeding progress for the challenge.
-In melee range multiple soldiers can soft lock you by taking turns to beat you down. The fact that they don’t shoot a target on the ground like that does not help in terms of time loss. 

*Edits are me adding bugs.

can be finished easily under 8 hours, AI is either very wonky not spotting you from 3m or very cheaty lock-on mode through bushes.

visuals are okay but nothing to write home about, weapon loadouts are kinda ""meh"" as they are nice to have but don't bring much to the table.

Missions are quite heavily railroaded and not open world at all. killcam feels like a budget version.
Looking at the dlc you can easily tell where most of the budget went to, and what the main focus of this game is.

Overall i'd say only grab on a decent sale.

It's your job to eliminate select targets in remote destinations around the world. These high priority targets are often well guarded and it's your job to end their existence by any means necessary. Sometimes this requires infiltrating bases and getting your hands dirty! Other times it can be pulled off with a calculated, controlled squeeze of the trigger. 

This game has a great bullet cam system that shows a slow motion bullet path from when it leaves the gun to when it exits the body of your target. The kills have a great satisfying feel to them because of this bullet cam.

1.不切实际的伤害判定。中型和重型狙击枪基本上打中上半身都可以一击必杀，但在超大地图的定点射击里，总会遇到打不死就读档的情况，所以建议开启一击必杀的作弊器以获得流畅的游戏体验。问题是，所有拿望远镜的小兵，其手臂很容易挡住它的头，如果不开启子弹视角，子弹打中手臂是不会判定穿过而命中脑袋的，哪怕用穿甲弹！矛盾的是，如果敌人是将手臂放下，此时击中手臂会造成断肢从而导致敌人死亡。

2.挑战中对敌人拉响警报的判定改了。契约1是允许敌人红色标识，但只要不发现玩家就不算警报。本作中是只要红色标识，不管有没有发现都算警报。并且敌人从标识变红到真正算上警报的时间不确定。在第一关中挑战要求不拉响警报击杀港口的所有敌人，你甚至可以不用引诱弹拉开敌人，直接屏住呼吸快速击杀两名敌人。而在免费DLC地图中，就算距离再近，快速击杀两名敌人都可以直接判定挑战失败。

3.没有任何物理效果。无论是布料帐篷、木板还是塑料瓶，除非用穿甲弹，不然别想打破。契约1好在没有固定点射击，敌人被障碍物挡着我可以走到旁边去，契约2的定点射击就恶心了。碰撞也没做好，第一关训练营有个士兵在车辆检修坑旁边，按理说击中他会因为惯性而掉下去，但并不是每次都可以。第三关解救人质的大地图里，目标敌人的上方有几个罐子，然而并不是每次击中罐子都会让它按照预想的那样掉下来。大型DLC中有几个绳索桥，在桥上蹲下用望远镜测量敌人出来的距离竟然是到绳索的距离——制作组完全没把绳索之间的空气墙去掉。再比如这个DLC中要求穿过障碍物击杀敌人，对于障碍物的判定特别奇怪，有些在墙后面可以击毙，有些在朽木后面却不可以，一点不合理。

4.奇葩的存档功能。虽然契约1也是一样，但是2更奇葩。比如我完成目标去上传数据时换装备了，我换好并且真的可以使用以后没走到存档点前，死了或者读取存档，装备会变成没变更之前的。有些存档在加载时会改变原有的设置，比如第三关有两个目标有碰面，其中一个身边有三个手下，如果杀掉所有手下后存档，再读档这个家伙只会在原地打电话不再走动。再比如第三关摧毁油田有个抵抗三波敌人的挑战，如果完成了任何一波后存档，再读档就不会再出现进攻你的敌人，只能任务重开。还有第四关要求不读档通关，居然连退出游戏都不行！

5.尸体和存档点BUG依然存在。这是不是好事我也说不准，因为在改变敌人判定警报的情况下，尸体消失会让游戏体验更好，但是又不符合逻辑，并且只会让不拉响警报击杀所有敌人的挑战更难。

6.武器平衡没做好。轻型狙击枪射速快，可装全息瞄准镜和消音器；中型狙击枪没特点，也有消音器，重型狙击枪瞄准镜放大倍率最高，但没消音器。其实带一把中型狙（推荐888）就能通全关了，因为轻型的特点不如用突击步枪，推荐556，重型没消音不适合经典地图。弓箭虽然新奇，但是特殊箭作用不大，普通箭不能收回，弹道还不稳定，还不如带消音的突击步枪，唯一的优点就是做挑战。

7.多动症的敌人。许多敌人不会老老实实站定，总是晃来晃去。尤其是定点狙击这么远，子弹还要飞一会。如果不多花时间去研究他们的动作，那么第一次射击子弹飞出去后，他们突然转个身、蹲下来真的很难受。

8.目前我玩过所有游戏中潜行最糟糕的游戏，没有之一。不仅完美继承了契约1中的脑残设定，如在敌人附件丢石头敌人不看石头而看向主角、连锁近战击杀判定不成功、偶尔连锁近战击杀会让敌人直接警报甚至开枪直接打死你等，甚至变本加厉。比如偶尔隔着草丛可以被敌人看见。躲进草丛后扔石头或者使用道具会取消隐匿。在草丛取消隐匿后偶尔要离开草丛再进来才能再次进入隐匿。在草丛中使用无人机时，敌人如果发现了无人机，会直接向主角开枪。在第三关摧毁油田的任务时，在第二和第三波支援敌军出现前躲在草丛也会被强制发现。

9.不开密位没风向指示器。只要敌人超过50米，也就是突击步枪看不清的距离，狙击枪都要开密位，因为有时候子弹偏转夸张到让你怀疑是不是出BUG了。

10.主角僵硬的动作。2021年了，连下滑楼梯都做不出来，而且在楼梯上不能掏出手枪，面对楼梯下的敌人只能干等他走开。从水里爬上岸居然眼睁睁看着能伸手扒上去，却还要找互动点或浅滩。像水都没膝盖高就不给奔跑、奔跑时不能换子弹，这些虽然不影响整体游戏，但是流畅性还是略打折扣。

11.玩家太容易被卡在场景里。比如两条木块搭成的桥中的缝隙中，某些地形的边缘，尤其是第二关通风管道的悬赏，管道和墙壁之间的缝隙非常多！被卡住时明明跳一下就解决了，但却不允许。

12.作用几乎为零的技能和装置。无人机被削的最惨，因为反无人机塔几乎无处不在且不能被摧毁，敌人相比契约1更容易发现无人机，无人机不再像契约1那样可以黑客炮塔，无人机的高度是相对高度（遇到水沟之类的就会强制下坠）等。炮塔设计为同步射击本来挺好，相关技能根本没用，一是定点射击几乎全都超过1千米，二是炮塔不带消音开枪居然会让几百米外的敌人警觉。诱饵、毒地雷这些本应该是潜行用的道具，反而会让敌人警觉。毒气手雷刚到敌人脚边就直接引起警觉了。医疗兵、肾上腺、耐力增强从来都没装备过。装置相关的技能一个都不需要，优先升级面具穿墙、自动标记、长距离探测和隐匿类技能，其余的想完成挑战再点。

13.BUG一大堆（附解决办法）。
爆炸子弹杀2人的挑战不计数。解决办法：先用炮塔标记一个独立目标，然后用爆炸子弹击杀成对敌人的瞬间，炮塔开枪。
伊莎贝拉处刑记者前击杀任何敌人会强制闪退。解决办法：开始任务后什么都不要动，直到伊莎贝拉把记者带到处刑台上杀掉的瞬间再开枪，记者死了没事，完成挑战就行。
中文翻译错误。解决办法：切换到英文。
敌人瞬移。解决办法：无解。
赏金目标尸体消失。解决办法：读档重玩。
面具穿墙无法标识敌人。解决办法：无解。
不开子弹视角不能三杀记者。解决办法：开启子弹视角，调大频率。

I enjoy this kind of games because, in most of missions, i don't have to rush and fight against time; at the opposite, i can think quite a bit and move on to the next move, like a chess round. The game is long enough in my opinion; of course, could be longer, but i enjoyed the experience very much. The location is beautiful, and the weapons physics is excellent. I've played at the max difficulty, and i have to say the AI is good. I loved the fact they look for you if they get suspicious, but not straight into you, just looking for you, so you have plenty of time to find a safe area, and escape from research. It could be a bit more difficult, of course, keeping the suspicious state until the end of the mission if they find a dead body, and temporary if only hear the shot or a noise. One thing i don't like is the drone function: the drone itself is awesome, it works well, but i would love to have only one for each mission (at least at max difficulty) so, if they shot it, you're done, no more drones for you. Plus, i find strange that, if they see it, they also get your position, which is unlikely possible in my opinion. Overall the experience is beautiful, the graphics is awesome, music beautiful, if you like this kind of games, then you should try it. Take your time, and don't rush.

1) This game is created in CryEngine
2) It is kinda bugged, but not too much, and because of CryEngine, movement feels very clunky
3) The weird part is that it is short if you play for the main campaign, but is long enough if you want to take your time in stealth and sniping to complete challenges.

Overall, I had fun, the game isn't really overpriced, but I would still buy it on sale with 25%+ discount. Now to the game mechanics review: movement feels very clunky and you kinda move like you are sliding on ice, but it's tolerable. Stealth is nice, but not challenging at all, AI is VERY stupid and blind, but it`s not bad either, you can play chillfully, I kinda even like that, but increase in difficulty on highest difficulty would be nice. Another weird thing - sniping is pretty fun, but shooting with anything that is not a sniper rifle is disgusting. It's difficult to find a game with worse semiauto and auto gunplay, but again, sniping is fun and you are gonna play this game for sniping and stealth, you won't really shoot anything else often, and when you'll have to, it's going to be weird, but those moment pass so fast, that you won't really remember. Challenges in game have a good balance of neccesity - you really should complete some challenges to open better gear, but you don't have to care about it too much if you don't want to. But again, the whole point of this game is challenges. Main campaign ends very fast and all that's going to be left after that is plenty of challenges, that make you replay the same campaign levels in a little bit different fashion.

So, in short - the game is fun if you need a chillful timekiller, or if you like arcade`y sniping and easy stealth. It has bugs but not too bad ones. Story is nonexistant, music is nice. Mechanics are alright. Game's pretty short. Price is okay, knowing what is happening with prices nowadays, but I would wait for a small discount.

The developer has made some very respectable titles through the years, with perhaps the only real problem I have noticed repeatedly being bad AI for Enemies and NPC's, in SGW3, it actually can break immersion, and that is a shame, because I really LOVED that game.  It they had fixed that, and perhaps went the route of CDPR content wise, the game would have been a home run.  In spite of that, I still loved it.

CI games has improved of the Sniper gameplay for contracts 1 & 2, with nearly all aspects of the game being top notch.  Instead of animated cut scenes, you have narrated movies at the beginning of all the segments, which works very well, the remaining exposition is handled via in game dialogue between Raven (player character) and his handler.  I found it to be surprisingly compelling.

There 7 maps, which are basically open worlds, with various terrains and objectives.  ""Longshot"" maps find Raven reaching a Sniper Nest at some point early in the level, and using his rifle to complete distant objectives.  Much of the gameplay is focused on Stealth/Infiltration, and other than the AI not being perfect, are about as good as it gets for that type of gameplay.

Weapons, accessories and tactics give you many different ways to achieve objectives.

A few negatives:
-No crouch slides.  Raven in very mobile, a shame they missed this one.
-The Map/objective trackers are a bit wonky. (minor issue)
-the weapon skins, in game and premium are all kind of MEH

Other than those, the game is quite good.

I would love to see the series continue, with an expansion of the concept.  Perhaps an urban setting, or a few map idea's that are bonkers.  (Trains, Metal Gear style Oil Rig Base)

SGW Contracts 2 also feature new type of mission: Long Range Mission where you need to do sniping from kilometers away just like actual sniper and need completely different approach than normal mission, which is i love

The weapon arsenal is quite small but every weapon has its use depend on your playstyle & no overlap between weapon. the gadget is more well designed in the mission but in my opinion it's still mostly gimmick

My only 2 complaint is the player movement is sometime still annoying & i wish this game has more contract, since missions replayability in this game is not fun & tedious, more tedious that hitman in my opinion

But still this is the best Sniper Ghost Warrior game yet & most realistic sniper game experience (without being a full-simulator) out there, just buy it at discount",1640949033,1640949033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall good quality. Solid gun play and really satisfying hit feedback. Requires planning for both long shot and infiltration missions but brute force + trial and error can work too. I'd like it to be more punishing when I take a bad shot but I enjoyed it anyways.

Sometimes enemies don't gradually become alert of you, they just instantly become alert. Fall damage also very buggy. Sometimes the bullet does not actually hit where your red dot indicator from the scope is indicating. Anti Aliasing is very poor and theres pretty much no difference between disabling and enabling it. Minimap very difficult to follow. And traversing walls and terrain is very difficult, you can only actually grab onto a ledge if it has a rope hanging from it, indicating a climbable wall, meaning you can't climb over a simple box, you're going to have to try and jump over it.

There are definitely some gear / weapons that are just always better / optimal than others, and if you do a couple challenges here and there you can have the best loadout pretty much after the first mission. I never used a first-aid kit, for example.

The bow is weirdly one of the strongest weapons in the game despite being up against high-tech guns, because it's perfectly silent and comes with explosive and gas, meaning it has more versatility than anything else you could put in that slot; the only thing you're giving up is accurate range, but even there it's good up to like 50m and you can sneak around to get closer than that easily anyway. I don't understand why you'd ever take a shotgun or SMG; It's really easy to stay stealthy if you use the bow and pay attention to enemies (especially with the later mask upgrades), and even if things do get hairy if you just keep your distance and hide again everyone goes back to chilling out. So you never have that moment of ""my cover's blown and enemies are right on top of me, gotta blast my way out of this with the shotty"", and if they ever do get that close and are shooting you you're probably dead anyway (unless you're on the easier difficulties).

The game also definitely left me wanting more missions. I finished it probably like a month or two ago but keep thinking ""I wish there was more SGW/C2 to play"", but I don't much fancy replaying missions I've already done. The missions play out exactly the same with enemies spawning in the same places with the same weapons etc, the only difference is your approach to them.

The difficulty also left me wanting more. You'll never run out of ammo / supplies (unless you're really careless), and stealth is just way OP; enemies are carefully placed with their patrol routes so you can always pick them off one-by-one or get multi-kills to progress through the levels without ever raising a hair, never mind an alarm, but this makes the game feel more like a puzzle game (how do I get these enemies dead without alerting those other guys?) than a game that requires skill and nerve (to shoot straight and true and not panic if bad guys spot you). So I wish there was a harder mode, maybe permadeath no-saves / reloads, so if you do mess up you do get that panicking and fighting / fleeing, rather than just rolling your eyes and reloading because you slightly missed or fell off a platform in front of an armoured guy.

The saving & loading mechanics are also weird. It doesn't let you manually save, but it auto-saves frequently, almost after every kill. There will be times you can just keep shooting away and reloading, ignoring stealth, because if you miss or die you're only loading back 5 seconds, and there will be times you'll want to try something fun / silly / experimental but haven't had a save in ages. I don't know why they don't just bite the bullet and add proper quicksave/load, the current autosave feature is both way too forgiving and on the verge of useless, depending on circumstances

Performance wasn't great on my PC (R9 290 X is getting on though lol) getting around 20-30 FPS most of the time but sometimes dropped to 15 in busy areas

There were occasional bugs, only one major one that meant I couldn't complete a mission the way I wanted / certain achievements were locked off for me

The story is really bland and kind of cringe for it to lean into ""western civilisation bad, middle east full of terrorists oo"", especially in a game where the player-character is totally black-ops. You haven't got any MI5 agents gone rogue hiding out in the alps or something? Why am I always fighting black and arab people? It's 2021 :/

It's weird that I have a bunch of negative things to say about it but I'd still recommend it. It's a fun game but it's mindless and there are a lot of frustrations that are holding it back from being a great game. I want to play more of it but it isn't really replayable. A bit of junk food, probably a good palate-cleanser to play between bigger serious games. I don't see the point in buying any of the DLCs (why on earth weapon skins are even in a single-player game is beyond me, and there's no weapon that could make my character more effective than the ones in the base game).",1640742660,1640742660,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ If you liked the original, go for it though the new installment lacks sufficiently new content. 
+ You can now probably pass half of the missions without killing anyone at all, the Deus Ex style. Much appreciated.
+ Tons of ways to approach each mission (tunnels, airways, etc.)
+ Replayability.

Cons:
- Too few missions but many ways to accomplish each.
- Most guns are f-ing useless. I've completed the entire game without changing or buying new guns.
- Saves are f-ing broken, they are automatic and you cannot choose what and when to save. Replaying from a certain point often becomes impossible because the game adds new automatic saves thus making your old saves disappear.
- AI is still idiotic however it sees you immediately from any distance whenever you miss a shot even when you have a silencer. They can also shoot at you at any distance using any guns, not just sniper rifles.
- Almost nothing new in terms of mechanics or features vs. the first game.
- No updates, no new maps, the game has swiftly been abandoned.
- Very uneven in terms of missions difficulty. The very last mission is a breeze, missions before it are way harder.
- Heavy enemies are bullet sponges in terms of shooting at their face shield masks.
- The game could be better optimized though. I had to lower resolution to get acceptable frame rates.
- No DLSS/FSR/TSR.
- Tons of bugs.

Bugs:
1. When the game starts it often crashes in ... the menu.
2. When the game starts it often loads in window mode though I've never pressed Alt + Enter.
3. The game often crashes when completing missions (shows the mouse cursor on top of the black screen).

The game supposedly starts off easy and gets harder as you go on with more enemies and different situations which force you to adapt to every situation. Or at least its supposed to be. I didnt feel like the game got harder. it got easier, the more i learned about the mechanics about the game the easier it got for me to not only beat it. but beat every mission without being seen.
And if you are seen you have to options which i have figured out. You can hide in a bush and use your sidearm with a supressor to take out every enemy which almost always move in a single file. 1 headshot. 1 headshot. 1 headshot. Outpost defeated.
OR, you could try to run away, to try again after the enemies have stopped searching.
You could technically try to terminator your way through, but unless you really invest in extra health, armour and so on, you find out really quickly that you die pretty much as quickly as the enemies does. Not that going terminator mode is reccomended as it is much less fun than having to plan your way in or through your enemies.
I would have like a stronger difficulty curve in the game which would mean that the start was a tuturial and the it got harder the closer i got to the end. After finishing the end mission i saw that it took only 10 minutes and had about 10 enemies to kill. I would have rather wanted to go out with a bang which really made me have to use all my skills, instead of the wet fart that i got.

Big levels with a lot to explore and experiment with. The weapon system seems a lil complicated at first. but becomes easy to understand as you play more. The story is nothing really important as the game play is clearly the focal point here. You get to plot out assassinations and try to complete contracts in your own ways which makes for lots of experimentation, and if you're like me you're gonna rely on your saves to help you do this. There are some technical glitches that lead to me needing to reload saves at annoying times and this is made worse because of auto saves rather than manual one (I would not have any gripes with the auto saves if it weren't for this). Despite this I still enjoyed myself, played all the story missions (on sharpshooter that is haha) and found myself wanting to come back whenever possible. Personally I do recommend this, fun mechanics with some flaws here n there but otherwise a good game at not too bad of a price.

Now for the overly descriptive part
 Okay so I'm gonna start this with I am NOT a game reviewer, I'm not someone who plays lots of fps games, I'm just some dude who plays whatever looks interesting to me. If you look at my page you'll see a disproportionate amount of point and click object finding puzzle games. I have NO CLUE what a good stealth shooter should be like, but I do know what feels fun to me and what doesn't. This IS fun to me, I loved sneaking around, taking out enemy snipers, plotting routes to complete my missions, and learning the moves of my targets. However the story was pretty basic, good enough to follow but never really the forefront of my mind. I like the protagonist Raven and the operator, Alex, he works with, though I feel like they were left without much character. Raven is a basic stoic protagonist and the operator is the typical secretive order giver, but they have some nice banter and near the end open a possibility for more interaction which is sadly not acted upon. The game's story just kinda ends and I don't really feel resolved or anything, instead I feel like there's more that is somehow hiding from me. I wanna know what else these two do, do the go on missions in other countries, are they still in contact, is this the end of their interactions, is this whole thing really just over? From what I've heard games like these don't seem to hold an importance on character growth, personal stories, and the like, but that doesn't mean I won't complain lol. I value story a lot and even if the game play is good I always feel like things could use a good story to tie it all together. Now aside from personal complaints like those I do have some genuine in game problems. I encountered a issue where Raven gets stuck between two or more objects, becoming completely immobile no matter what you do, all his movements are cancelled aside from looking around. Clearly this got frustrating and I could only remedy it by reloading an old save which could be super annoying especially after I spent so much time setting up a kill. Another common issues I ran into was the map glitching, sometimes it would lock into place and I wouldn't be able to move around, activate information, or even teleport. I always had to go to the main menu to get the map to work again and I'm sure you can tell how that made me annoyed from time to time. Other issues I ran into were the dialogue starting before I even loaded in making me miss parts of the conversation as well as the subtitles just not working sometimes. I found some glitched textures such as a strip of wall in the temple level that flickered violently on and off and a vehicle that would start vibrating due to collision when approached. Also there's a giant floating platform in Rashida's assassination level above the helicopter, is that even supposed to be there? Welp those are all of my current thoughts, I'm probably gonna haul ass and try to 100% the missions now.",1639126820,1639126820,True,0,0,0.497701823711395264,0,True,False,False

I like sniper games, besides Sniper Ghost Warrior I also played through Sniper Elite franchise. Sniper Elite feels more challenging, real, and exciting - when you land a precise shot it gives you good insight of vital organ damaged. 

Sniper Ghost Warrior, however, feels like a reduced version of Sniper Elite, but fair for its price.
You do not get a good visual when you land a beautiful hit, the bullet just blow the brain off or go through the body. It is also less challenging but you can still get into trouble, but of less punishment. The environment is a bit repeated, but not to the degree of intolerable.  It has re-play value - some targets can be killed in multiple ways for achievements, and there are collectables and bounties to wander around the map.

I'm mixed with the long distance only sniper missions, it would have been nice to have the choice to get closer.  If memory serves, was a mix of 3 shoot from fixed position maps, and 2 large open world maps, though the last map was far too short for my liking and left me wanting.  The original game was totally open world maps, which was much better IMHO, plus it let me enjoy the map design.

The maps looked gorgeous and ran well with a 21:9 ultrawide 1440p monitor on a Radeon 6900xt and Ryzen 5900x system.  The models definitely seem more detailed too.  A big step up.  Kudos to the artists.

I had only one crash, which was when loading the last mission.  Other than that, it was solid.

The AI is pretty weak, just largely popping up and then hiding over n over, particularly when shooting from a distance.  It would be nice to have enemies change cover more often, and perhaps work in groups, do flanking tactics, particularly in the long range maps -- Though the latter wouldn't work unless the enemies can get closer to me, or vice versa.  Enemies also need to zigzag, and use cover while advancing.  The mechanic where all the enemies know exactly where I am is poor.  Again, AI was weak and no improvement over the original - I hope they work on this.

I hate the checkpoint/saving system, which is still there sadly.  It's a huge pain to run back half the map to find a save point.  I really detest devs forcing this on me!

All in all, if you love sniping mixed with action and stealth, I suspect you'll like this.  I only got 9 hrs gameplay in my first run through, though I suspect I'll be replaying it on harder difficulties.

Update: LOVE the free map. It's massive and fun to play, and comes with multiple objectives. Definitely one I'll enjoy replaying. Thanks Devs!",1623485740,1638410277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

_________________________________________________

This is a solid game - a really solid game. A bit like the Splinter Cell games but with a sniper rifle and drone.

Sadly it isn't a very long game though, I restarted a dozen times a map and still completed it in 11.5 hours. So far I've not really found the replay value unless you go into it either going 100% long-distance or 100% close up and personal gameplay (I mixed it up). For this reason alone I can't openly recommend it.

If you have the money spare then get it (I got it on sale - 33% off), or if its heavily discounted (not really worth the £25 I paid).",1638300198,1638300198,False,0,0,0.434379041194915771,0,True,False,False

 Not worth it, badly researched despite the fun draw distance: the AI is pretty sad, its more like bullying than it is saving the world from bad people.. 
Once alerted you can hide in a bush (retro Assassins creed style) and use a silenced weapon like pistol to calmly pick them off one by one.. 

You can also be Hit by the AI accurately hitting you from 1000m ranges!!

Playing in 4k resolution is not a consideration if you are expecting to maintain at least 60 fps. Even with a GTX2080 and an i9 processor, I experienced numerous constant frame rate drops in 1080p, especially when autosaving. Graphic and keyboard options also often do not save when switching between offline and online modes. There is also no manual save so you must repeat the same sections over and over again when you get killed. Also, when making a single shot while hidden from the enemy you are immediately descended upon by large groups of enemies that rush your position. Mission objectives are also very unclear and it is very confusing where you need to go on the map. All missions also take place in the same dull desert environment where all maps look like they were made for a multiplayer deathmatch. Sniping is also terrible in this series compared to the Sniper Elite series because you can't just point and shoot. You must constantly dial in elevation and search for a little red floating dot that you place way outside the target to adjust for distance and wind, even when playing on the easiest difficulty. You also can only sprint for very short distances and climbing is excessively difficult in this game. Getting stuck in the environment is also very common.

      Having played  SGW 1-3 and SGW Contracts I was really anticipating the sequel from CI games . The  SGW franchise has its own finger print of game play and mechanics that sets its self apart from any other sniper franchises on Steam . Graphics are stunning with an older GPU 960GTX  . Voice acting is great and the sounds of the game are also very good.The long distance sniping contracts that where added are a great addition since SGWC . There signature slo-mo kill cam and gore settings are great as always but can be set to off if wanted . Price is fair enough at $39.99 base game with 20-75 hours of game play depending on your style of play and what you want to complete. If I had one complaint I would say it needed a few more achievements. An example completing a map region to 100% for players that don't like to run thru a game will take there time and complete all content for a trophy. An achievement for pistol head shots or 250m head shots,drone kills, stealth kills and so on. Some challenges should have been game achievements they are that good .Also there should have been alot more Deadeye achievements in the game other then 1 for each map.",1623011988,1637777736,True,17,0,0.634906351566314697,2,True,False,False

You can play in a variety of styles (stealth kills, all out bombardment, or sniping).  I'm not a hugely experienced gamer but its a great game to play for a few hours to relax after work...

There are several issues where you can get stuck in awkward places but usually this can be fixed by changing your weapon.  

If you want a game where you can try different combat tactics on repeat plays of each scenario then this is the game for you.

Whether you are a first timer to this particular game's franchise or played the previous title ""Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts"", I would advise you to ""curb your enthusiasm"" when considering this game. While this game has some greatly appreciated improvements over the preceding title, there are a lot of core feature flaws that have honestly plagued 'Ghost Warrior' games for many, many years. Go watch a video of the game-play, and perhaps take your time researching reviews. While the purpose of this review is largely to express my disappointment with the game, I will also touch on some positive aspects in an attempt to be fair and thorough. If this gets tl;dr for you at any point, please scroll to the bottom for a summary.

For reference, I played this game from start to finish on 'Deadeye', the hardest difficulty available, to get the full experience of the game.

So let's dive in.

[hr][/hr]

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]

[b](1)[/b] The quality of the graphics are pretty high, and probably the best thing about the game's design. That draw-in effect from a game's visual appeal is important, and they know it.

[b](2)[/b] The level design is pretty great from conception to execution, with some minor drawbacks in between. I love the way they built most of the key areas through-out the game. 

[b](3)[/b] Despite issue [b](2)[/b] of the 'Cons' section of this review, you do get a [b]lot[/b] of nice long-distance line-ups over the course of the game. You will not be disappointed if this is what you're here for. (Though I personally don't care for the same bullet cam every single time)

[b](4)[/b] The story of this game is a bit more fleshed out than the previous one, particularly with the FreeLC expac that continues the base game. Additionally, you will likely have a noted appreciation for Raven's now ""grown man"" voice and his conversations with Control as the game progresses. 

[hr][/hr]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]

[b]Gameplay Inconsistencies[/b]

[b](1a)[/b] [u][b]AI[/b][/u] -- the amount of AI glitching I can see in a single play-through of a region is an honest-to-goodness let-down. This pertains both to AI awareness and the pathing of AI routes. Simply put, they are not executed well enough, to the extent that you can have a situation where enemies are walking in place against an object or won't react in a logical manner to certain environmental stimuli. These can range from the AI's danger recognition being off -- e.g. an arrow, knife, or other non-sniper rifle weapon impact triggering a cringe-worthy ""There's a sniper on us!"" -- to the AI automatically (in some cases) knowing your precise location the instant a ""suppressed"" shot misses outside of the audible range of the report. (For reference, using the quietest sniper rifle in the game)
[b](1b)[/b] There are quite a few instances during a single mission's play-through where an enemy AI would have no logical path of reasoning to reach their conclusion of whether or not the enemy is visible or that they are under attack. The AI plainly needs a rework. Examples of this include:
 [b]i.[/b] (hilariously) an AI literally turning to you as they are saying their one-liner and continue to stare at you while you are phasing in-and-out of ""hidden"" status in some flimsy small bush cover but never acknowledging you as a hostile despite no longer being hidden.
[b]ii.[/b] the AI immediately knowing exactly where you are without an audio/visual cue before an alerted enemy has even radioed in to their squad.
[b]iii.[/b] being seen while in cover. This is hit or miss. I have literally been prone in low-grass cover close enough to a guard to pull their leg out from under them and was never seen. In a near-identical situation, I have been spotted from about 5m by a guard while in high brush cover. Adding ratios of obscurity to differing types of vegetation would go a long way to making this more realistic, instead of a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach.
[b](2) [u]Bugged scope mechanics[/u][/b] -- being required to zero out your scope before you engage a hostile at close range (less than 100m) just to hit them where your scope reads - despite physically having nothing but the target in your scope's view (for an extreme example). To clarify the example, imagine a situation where you just finished a target with your scope dialed in at 1km, and you need to transition to an enemy that is approaching within 10m. Your gun's shot will react 100% on what your scope is dialed in to, [b]including wind and bullet drop[/b] and not the real physical distance to your target. Your shot [b]will miss[/b] if you don't zero as fast as you can in that situation. The disparity of the programming logic is palpable. This was a game-play experience breaker the first time I encountered this 'feature'. 

[b](3) Climbing[/b] -- Raven inexplicably needs to jump up before dropping down from a ledge; if a guard is within view of the ledge they [b]will[/b] notice. Additionally, Raven can't decide whether to grab for a ledge or not regardless of you jumping right at it. This mostly applies to jumping backward gaps while climbing, which doesn't occur too often, depending on the routes you take during a mission. The most trouble I had with this was on the latest FreeLC mission expac. -- Kudos to the devs for adding some new content to the game at all, which is not typically the norm. Players [b]do[/b] appreciate this!

[b](4) Overall Detraction of Quality[/b] -- When you add all of these things up into the context of a game that is supposed to be not only [u]polished and ready[/u] but [b]fun[/b], it can be quite frustrating just to clear a mission in a single play-through for challenges, through I-don't-know-how-many loaded last saves or [strike]auto-[/strike]saves which just disappear if you need to quit the game. The amount of times I have had to reload the game during a single mission just to overwrite an error -- whether it was something illogical happening with the AI or an honest flawed execution on my part -- really breaks the experience for me as a player. It simply ceases to be fun at a certain point. 

[hr][/hr]

So in summary, this game is a mixed bag of both good and bad qualities. What I can say to the hopeful buyer looking for that next realistic sniper-stealth game experience is that you will probably be disappointed by this game after you're done with it, yet still want to stick it through for challenge completions and the like (if you're into that sort of thing). The hardest difficulty isn't really all that, as the difficulty isn't scaled properly, again with the AI issues being the core problem. For those who played the first installation of SGWC, you've got your typical clumsy contextual character movement in certain scenarios and all the sound bytes of Raven grunting when climbing or dropping down you could ask for. Despite the annoyances, this game is a sure step-up from it's predecessor in terms of quality and is still worth something.",1636523903,1637005816,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want to kill AI from 1200m or more distance then this is a perfect game for you.
If you want a game which depends fully on sniping then avoid this game (though this game called sniper ghost warrior)
There are missions where you need to have close encounter with AI enemy inspite of have your long range sniper.
My advice would be to not to rush to finish the missions as there are lots to do in a single mission. So that you can earn money and other stuffs to buy gadgets and other elements for your inventory.

I normally LOVE sniping mechanics and pretty much always play stealthily when given the opportunity. The issue that I have with SGWC2 is that it looks open world but really isn't in frustrating ways. 

For example, in the early missions, where one needs to get into different vantage points to snipe from different angles. The game makes it look like there are multiple ways to move around but there aren't. 

Jump over a railing to take a shortcut. Dead by falling.
Jump a ledge to get there. Dead by falling.
Try to climb something that looks like it is inches tall. You can't. 


While you do have multiple ways to deal with things, this game is much more linearly designed than it seems.

In this new installment, you have a special type of map with long range contracts. These will regularly require shooting 900 - 1500m (so far, haven't finished the game). This works without any issues on the same PC (no glitching at all). The amount of calculating has increased, which is nice. The old red dot is available for people who don't want to do the math or who don't want to risk missing. The only thing I can think of that could use further improvement is the shooting mechanics (I know, this game does it best, but it's not perfect yet). It would be nice to have to calculate real wind values across the entire distance and angles (at least, on the most extreme mode). Imagine keeping DOPE from easier difficulties or earlier attempts just to be able to calculate your shots.",1634616346,1634616346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The weapon and character customization, the voice acting, the mission design, the feeling of being a sniper with implemented mechanics that do their best to mimic realism via accounting for distance and wind speed for every shot.

It has a hitman kinda feel to it in the way that the missions are designed giving you opportunities to figure out how you want to play a certain scenario.

Overall, the only qualms I have with the game are largely down to small polish. As a whole, I have not been a huge fan of the funky futuristic assassin mask since they introduced it in the first contracts. Personally, I think I would enjoy a more plausible modern-day ""realistic"" aesthetic over the current, but that could very well just be me. I also enjoyed the more open sandbox areas from Sniper Ghost Warrior 3, along with the way the story missions were laid out in that game over the current. 

To sum it up, if you played the first Contracts game, you'll enjoy this. It's got more of the same, with some general enhancements made here and there. On the other hand, if you're coming from SGW3 and expecting more of that, you'll find many similarities, but expect a smaller play area with a bit more funneled paths through the level. 

To rate the game out of 10, I'll give it a 6/10. 

It's not bad. it's not the best. It's perfectly serviceable, and it's a good timekiller.

I am mainly comparing with Sniper Elite Franchise:

Theres almost no point of doing anything silently from far away, coz the enemy locates your location through the wall. The AI sometimes just spawns behind you when you go on alert. Shoot 400m away, straight away locates my location even though i'm prone in a bush. AI travels in a given path rather than moving around. 

Luckily no crashes or anything like that.

In terms of gameplay, visual and map design is excellent! BUT its wasted by not putting special items or like ammo stash or like extra stuff to keep making you explore the map properly. I am the kinda guy who legit runs through the whole map wanted to find stuff that would make me OP lol 

But its all wasted due to lack of world content. 

Objective information is very bad, like doesn't say much at all about whats left to do or like any hints, i was stuck in few spots where i thought I completed the objective but i was missing 1 item... And had to look at youtube vids to find it. 

Gun play is awesome, sniping feels authentic but its falls short on lack of content in the world.

The short range contracts play very much like SGWC1 missions did, so if you enjoyed those, you should have a good time. There aren't a huge variety of guns that are optimal for the long shot contracts yet, but I expect we'll see some in future content. 

Biggest criticism I would say; The AI is a bit too sharp at higher levels. I got a knife kill on a lone soldier who was in searching mode, and when i did, the base at the bottom of the hill locked on to my position an started firing mortars. I had been in an underground part of a mountain top bunker, and men 100's of meters down hill heard a knife kill, I guess.

I would say the biggest problem is how easy the game is. Enemies are blind and deaf most of the time, and I could complete missions just by sprinting everywhere with a silenced pistol. The level designs mixed with the enemy AI made it so gadgets were nearly useless, and only served as a way to spice up the gameplay rather being necessary tools to help you. Your also given way too much information over the radio, making so you can't even think for yourself. If you mute the radio and turn off subtitles you can miss vital information to help you, but then your forced to listen you the guy tell you absolutely every gameplay strategy. 

What annoys me the most about the difficulty though is that it's based on the enemies rather than yourself. Even on the hardest difficulties it's nearly impossible to miss a sniper shot because of how much information your scope gives you. You really only start missing at 1km+ on moving targets. At those distances if you miss, enemies can spot you and easily shoot you with assault rifles. I not once ran out of ammo and being able to easily buy a silenced pistol, assault rifle and sniper rifle made it way too easy. I would have preferred something like Sniper Elite's limited silenced ammo rather than just being able to put suppressors on everything. 

Visually I find the game a little over the top with mission brief animations. The head bobbing was nearly a deal breaker for me. I cannot play with head bobbing and I would have refunded the game had I not found a tutorial on how to edit the game files to disable it. 

On a positive note the game is relatively bug free, the couple I did experience were fixed by going to the main menu and back. Though I did lose a little progress doing this as there is no manual saves. It seems like an odd choice to not have manual saves and I would have preferred the option to manually save. The auto saves were good most of the time though. 

Lastly, the game feels a little too short to experience all the different gadgets and weapons. It relies more on replaying it, and personally I don't think it's very replayable given how easy it is.

I played the first game and found it fun yet enjoyable, though i wish it had more to it. Thats where i thought this game would come in and fill up the gaps missed by the original game. Im about 8 hours in, one mission left so I would say I have a pretty good idea of what the game has to offer so far. 

Starting review. I really dislike the voice lines and acting, as well as the assassination/interrogation for one big fuckup. There are maybe 5 voice lines for the interrogation, which are all EXACTLY the same voice actor. The only way you kill the guy is EXACTLY the same. The assassinations have 5 animations. 1 for prone enemies (snipers) and the rest vary on enemy stance but considering how much stealth the game has. The bullet physics are fun, but everyones head turns into this playdough mess, instead of having more defined textures. I really like the game and i thought it was a good thing to enjoy and play, however its got some large issues.

--Performance is phenomenal on my crappy 1050ti 
--gamepad controls are excellent, no qualms (though I wish I could swap the trigger button to RB instead of RT)
--maneuvering around the map is much less of a headache compared to SGW:C 1
--new long-range maps are really fun and test your abilities to hit targets from more than a mile off
--autosave system is much more forgiving compared to the first game (still can't manually save though, your mileage may vary)
--feels like the developers really nailed down the Hitman-esque gameplay this time around with the regional maps

AI is largely dumb, movement is glitchy in places and the narrative talks about elements of the mission you've already completed if you do them out of the expected sequence.  Enemy tagging loses its memory frequently and there are so many glitches of behaviour.  I once had about twenty enemies form up in a grid pattern on 'alert' just letting me shoot them from half a km away one by one.   Some enemies become 'suspicious' just after you've killed them.  Some bosses materialise from nowhere at the end of a level as if to ensure that the level completion logic works.   Your character can be waste deep in water but still doing the breast stroke whilst being shot at.   Did I mention the glitches? 

Equipment loadout is uninteresting, as you have access to some of the most capable sniper rifles from near the start and the in-game currency makes no sense.  Likewise skills progression.  There are some gimicky turrets and drones for your to play with, but they are not intuitive and don't really add to the sniping experience.  Big gun, small gun and some throwables is all you need if the map design is good - which in general they are, though horrible to navigate, with no ability to set markers or know whether the route you're taking is accessible.  

In short, it's not anywhere close to the quality of sniper elite, which is probably the benchmark for the genre.  Why would I recommend it then?  Well it kept me entertained for 25 hours for not many dollars.  It enables you to take very long shots (1.5km) whilst accounting for windage and trajectory and forces you to account for target movement and timing.  The mechanics of the pure sniping element of the game are therefore quite good.

There's enough there to distance itself from similar titles in this genre that you'll get a good experience out of it. It doesn't reach the same level as the gameplay can be a little hollow. The AI is hit and miss (literally) but it's not terrible.

[b]Performance & Graphics[/b]
- 80-110FPS average with an RTX 3080 (91% pwr, ~1870-1930MHz), 10900K (5GHz), 4K, max settings
- options are a bit basic. Medium-Very High graphics toggles - low doesn't exist?, The AA implementation is kind of.. bad. Yes/No for AA; no 2x,4x,8x, TAA, FXAA, etc. I'd go with setting an override within Nvidia Control Panel for a better image.
- colour grading is kind of dull but that might be what the dev wanted. Just seems bland in some maps.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
- AI is very hit and miss with intelligence and consistency. You could be in a snipers line of sight and not be seen in one run, reload and go back to the same point (yet neither of you have moved) and now they see you.
- Bullet cam is alright, they couldn't rip off Rebellion completely with the skeleton effect from SE series so they went for jelly effect instead. You'll see what I mean.
- The lack of manual saves is really annoying. Some runs you'll have well timed autosaves but others you'll find yourself thrown back 10-20mins. Might push you to get single playthroughs but still.. compared to others in the genre.. this should be added.

[b]Bugs, Crashes, other issues[/b]
- 3 crashes to desktop, all while choosing to quit to main menu. Bit odd. No error codes found and reliability reports show no consistency.
- no frame drops or any game breaking experiences
- background music will go mute occasionally between melee kills (not chained ones). You could melee someone and suddenly there's just environmental sounds and no music. Bit jarring. The background music will only return on the next melee kill.

[b]DLC[/b]
- not even worth looking at really
- skins for a singleplayer game, no sense, who is looking at it? The NPCs? The split second I see it in bullet cam? The main menu?

Get it on sale, it's a decent game but lacks depth to prevent it being a major hit like SE4 or Hitman 3, etc. That's about it really. Hope CI can improve with the next one.

It deserved a bit more effort in the enemies department, they are straight from contracts 1. 

I encountered a few bugs, nothing reloading the last checkpoint didn't sort out and the developer has been proactive with patches. The latest free dlc addition gives another mission to complete.

Every time I would infiltrate a new base I would aggro the whole base, it seemed it dident matter which person I killed first. The games dosent tell you why you aggro the whole base or how you stay undetected when taking shots. 
I had to load old saves before everyone starts shooting at me so I could feel like sneaky sniper.

So basically I Quick-Scoped my way through this game, which defeats the whole purpose of the game.

BUT! I have to give it to them, everything els is very cool. How they present the game, snipers, sidearms and tacticals are very cool. I used the game a bit for stresstesting my computer, and everything was and ran beautiful. So I would recommend it if it is on sale.

Pros:
-Sniping is smooth like butter and satisfying
-Level design is excellent
-Multiple different approaches to an objective is never a bad thing

Cons:
-Movement feels chunky and unresponsive at times. 
-Enemies can acquire you almost instantly with little to no searching at all ranges
-*Long range contracts seem a little too difficult (It takes all kinds of effort to accurately hit a single target without alerting anyone but when alerted the AI can all accurately hit and kill you from well over 1000m with small arms fire, and are seemingly unaffected by wind and gravity)

*This review is based on me playing on deadeye difficulty so I may be just experiencing some of those difficulty-specific features that i think are an issue but really arent.

Pros:

The sniping mechanics themselves are very well done.  With bullet trajectory and wind velocity playing an excellent factor.

The stealth mechanics are great.

It feels great to find a high overlook and just pick dudes out from the outskirts working your way in and not raise the alarm once.

Cons:

most of my cons are about ammunition.

1, since when do guys I drop only carry 3 rounds of ammunition for their assault rifles?

2, I wish the ammunition was a bit more standardized.  What many people don't realize, is that a ""Designated Marksman Rifle"" is pretty standard for engagements out to 500yds-ish, these use the standard 308 win or 7.62 nato cartridge.  Past that, common rifle rounds for out to 1000yds+ are 338 Lapua and 300 win mag.  Then for even crazier engagements you get things like .50 BMG.  There is never an engagement that warrants using something as large as 50 BMG, since those are intended for use out to 3000yds.  Then they have all sorts of weird ammunition guns as your secondary rifle and not a single use of 308 win, which is extremely common not just in marksman rifles but in standard issue rifles as well.  This would allow the player to have a mid-range engagement rifle and a closer engagement automatic rifle sharing the same ammunition and magazines.

3, why are there only bolt action rifles available?  (with the exception of a few either light rifles or one really big one) Again, a standard DMR, would most likely not be bolt action.  If the devs feel the need to step up the rifles, there are also many options firing 300 win mag that are not bolt action.  Then there are the obvious, everybody-knows-about sniper rifle, barret M82 or XM500 semi-automatic rifles.  At least provide some more semi-automatic options for a premium in game price instead of forcing bolt action.

4.  I think the scope's functionalities are pretty cool, except 1: why use anything other than a long range scope, and 2: why not use the more standard MOA or MIL measurements in the rifle.  I'm not an expert on these kinds of things, and maybe a contract killer would have access to the funds and manufacturers to customize his scopes to the caliber that he's shooting, but the fun of 500-1000yd target shooting for me (in real life) is understanding the ballistic coefficient of the round I'm firing and how it reacts to gravity and gets pushed by the wind.  This comes back to, I have no idea what caliber of round I'm firing out of the rifle.


Despite the bulkier cons, these are very nit-picky, and I've never played a game that actually takes this information into consideration :/, maybe I'll develop my own XD haha.  This is definitely a great option for those who just want to perch somewhere up high and do some sniping, my favorite part in any fps game.",1628970902,1628970902,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Honorable mentions include, loading a save and the sniper in the huge elevator section is alerted, but frozen, snipers falling through the floor, and the mask mode key not being remappable on your drone. (though keymapping is greatly improved in this version I'll admit, because in the first game you couldn't remap a key without it messing up another key so I had to play with the default layout in SGWC1 [annoying]). Mostly fun game, though I wish it wouldn't have included the weird and evil tales in the collectibles lore (egregiously, the immodest semi-nude dancing woman, though this seems to be a evil running gag to put one semi-nude woman in the game like in SGWC1 having a woman sexually dancing in her underwear for a brief moment to highlight human trafficking).

This game is the best because you're not limited to be held at a distance 100% of the time, the biggest problem with sniping in a jungle is when your enemies force you into close quarters. This is not a game of kilometer long headshots, this is a game of tactics. Outwit your enemy to survive.

At face value the game is fun to play. The sniper mechanics are solid and rather easy to pick up. The visuals are great all the way around and the voice acting is top notch. 

The missions are fairly varied and so are the loadouts you can take to each mission. There are about 4 missions to each region. In most missions the players choices and loadouts dictates how a mission will turn out. If it doesn't go as one would like, you exit and reenter the region and try again. 

You won't need to put in 60 hours to build up your skill tree and buy new armaments and gadgets. Within 10 hours you'll have a good assortment of options to take to new missions/regions. 

The Not so perfect

Jump and grab a ledge. Only if its meant to be grabbed. Some ledges simply can't be scaled and in a fire fight, that's the worst way to find out. Include this bit with the overall level design. Some areas are more intuitive than others. 

The Skill Tree. Some of the gadget upgrades aren't anywhere as beneficial as described.  

No manual saves. However the game does a good job of autosaving. I have yet to find myself losing a large amount of mission progression due to death.  

Not really Bad 

I consider this a mid tier game. So long as your not expecting a huge character arc or back story, it works for that reason, it is somewhat repetitive. The enemy AI can be all over the place as far as behavior and effectiveness.

It's definitely an improvement on the 1st Contracts game.
I'm not sure why some folk are moaning that there's not enough content.  There is.  Quite a bit more than in the previous title.  An if you play the game on the easiest setting, it's going to be too easy.
Having said that, the second 'Marksman' level of difficulty is pretty tricky.  Slightly unrealistic as to how quick the bad guys rush to your location once you've been discovered.....
Graphics are similar to the last title, as are the controls which are identical.
Cut shots look more brutal.
The one thing that is infinitely better is the sniping distances which can range from close to around 1300m, considerably further than Contracts 1.
Weapon choices again is identical manner to Contracts 1 - weapons generally are good and varied.
Load times are better - and when resuming a contract after a break, you don't have to suffer the intro to the contract each reload.

The only thing that really really bugs me is the graphic lock-up on Interegations.  This has been a glitch since Interegations have been around since the second game of the series, and were important in the third title.  Graphic lock up was a real issue in just about every title prior to this one, and it really should have been fixed by now.  To still have it in Cotracts 2 is a disgrace - seems no matter how frequent the issue is reported, nothing is done about it.  In previous titles, graphic lockdown after interegations was hit and miss.  This game - the first interegation and every interegation induces a cut scene that gets out of sync with the video and locks the game up.  
That really is the only down side  - but it's a bad one.  The only thing that redeems this glaring fault is the improvement in other areas.  The only other down side is the fifth and final official contract which is very two-dimentional  compared to the other contracts.  The additional sixth contract added to the original ones more than makes up for it.",1628190974,1628191299,True,1,0,0.502245545387268066,0,True,False,False

The original game, and its sequel were trying way to hard to imitate CoD with its presentation and felt like it was trying to be something unique, but ended up perpetuating the worst sin you can make in a shooter game... Being boring.

That being said, I had hopes that one day they would finally settle on something that would give this franchise the potential it has. This game did the trick! Feeling like they took a page out of Sniper Elite's book and implemented their own flavor on top of it, like a good double scoop of ice cream. The sniping mechanics are satisfying and a joy to dial in, and that slow motion head burst had a nice smile on my face. Schwacking targets 1k meters out with these rifles is a blast every time, however, I do think its stupid that some grunt who spotted me with his bino's would not be able to reach me with his rifle. Especially when its one that has an effective range of 400-500 meters. 

And the writing? The writing is for lack of a better word, there at best, cringe at worst. I would love to see some creativity on this aspect, and give me a reason to care!

I knew they could do it. I had faith. I always knew.. but nobody listened. 

Since the first SGW I knew they had the potential, the drive, definitely the right idea and direction for an amazing title.. ""realistic sniping"" they proclaimed.. they got a lot right, enough to keep me hoping the next would be perfect. The games weren't bad, just.. lacking somehow, each in its own way. Couldn't bring myself to finish one. They struggled and worked hard to achieve the lofty and difficult goal of realistic sniping that every person could agree met their definition of realism. They never quit.. through hundreds and hundreds of bad reviews, they kept at it. They experimented with different mechanics and combinations, different map layouts, overhauled game-play designs, AI behavior.. like pulling the handle on a slot machine and praying to please the whimsical but merciless gods of accrual. They never gave up. And now, at long last.. just over 11 years and all that experience later.. they did it. I will finish this game and any new map expansions. They finally struck gold with this balancing act of challenging-fun-realistic-optimized-beautiful that we absolutely deserve. A pleasure to play. Scout, strategize, infiltrate, maintain precision, draw a breath and.. watch the magic. You are the Ghost they promised.

Some sniper teams such as the US has groups of 4 sniper teams which is 1 sniper, 1 spotter or recon unit that is capable of both support role and or spotter recon unit for the sniper, then you have 2 support role units to guard the snipers and recon units back that are basically standard military units. I'm not a solo kind of guy I like being alongside other friendly AI so it feels that I'm in the real thing. Solo games should be restricted to horror games.

2. Maps are great hate those pesky flies they put into the game, but there is room for improvement on the hardest difficulty its really not that hard to stay hidden seams like the developers of this game took a short cut in upping the damage for the hardest difficulty that the enemy can do and barely any enemy troop AI way too many absurd gaps in the game especially the first mission which is the most obvious where the player starts in the desert with all these bases around the cliff side edge where the player is running around where there should be more troops rather then a handful of them so many buildings yet they only placed 10% of troops that could actually fill them.

3. Like the second problem but this time its the patrols. Kind of strange that there are allot of gaps where there is a single patrol when in reality a single patrol consist of up to 4 to 6 troops and some bases through out the game should be packed with at least 70 enemies yet at most I've seen were like 35 enemies Id say to make it really realistic on the hardest difficulty they should place 100 enemies per large base depending on the size and how many buildings surround or are in the base.

4. Don't like the fact that some buildings you simply can't enter. I've seen a few but they don't have the option for them for breach and clear and this is where a 4 man team for the single player missions would have come in great at not just covering the players back while he or she is sniping.

5. Compared to the previous games I do have to say there is less chatter between the enemy troops about why they are there or just bad mouthing there bosses or exposing what little they know what they're bosses are doing.

6. Drop offs and ex-filtration points on the maps should have a cut seen each time where the player is dropped by a helicopter and or military vehicles before and after each mission whether leaving and or going to the mission its realistic.

These are the types of problems that I see in allot of todays games corners are cut because the audience is impatient for the games release or the developers simply don't want to put the last 25% effort in perfecting a game or any game. These are not all the problems with this game and others but the few major ones that make it obvious and for this I'm sorry that I have to give this game a thumbs down.",1628056110,1628056110,False,3,0,0.420396655797958374,0,True,False,False

Some great moments and great sniper action, but the game also doesn't quite cater to the idea of being a sniper. In the missions I've tried this far you get dropped at the absolute most horrible spots you could imagine for a sniper. The terrain you'd ideally make use of is typically impossible to reach/traverse and leaves you having to engage in borderline hand-to-hand combat before you can get to the actual sniping in the ""contract areas"".

The good stuff first: GUI is good, progression system and upgrades are fine (some upgrades possibly a bit OP). Looks great, good music with nice aesthetics, ambience and voice acting. The sniping mechanics are great, but could imo be made harder for a game that focuses on sniping.

While the enemies you encounter in these situations have the aim of drunken stormtroopers at the next highest difficulty (3/4), you will sometimes be fired on and killed from what the radar picks up as being above(!?) you. Enemies will also struggle to find you in the bushes 10 yards away, but have no issues hitting you with SMGs when you're prone and out of line of sight 1100 yds away if you happen to blow an alarm.

The actual sniping aspect of the game readily invites to save-scumming. One shot missing (or hitting at the wrong time) will raise an alarm extremely easily leading to the target escaping and other objectives being forfeited. At the highest difficulty it's almost a crapshoot making challenges like ""kill 50 enemies and the main target without raising an alarm"" being an exercise in loading games.

While I'm sure the devs did their research, I'm not sure if the weapons picked for reference are the best options at long range. Even if you're not in the gameplay>realism camp, the travel time and drop seem a bit off. The idea that a ""heavy"" (armored infantery) can't be killed by a 7.62 also very much lands us in the ""we need to make this harder by some means"" (i.e. gameplay>realism) making the design concepts a bit contradictory.

Caveat emptor: If you enjoy a bit of this and that and a bit more complicated sniping than you get with MW and BF - Go for it! If you want a complicated realistic sniping game without the FPS aspect this might not be for you however. This is not a hyper-realistic tactical game. It's an FPS title that takes sniping a bit more seriously which honestly might appeal to a lot of people.

Nice level design with very good textures, Well thought out and executed. Looks good!
Good story lines. Provides interesting, informative and concise backstories. Giving enough information to help you but not boring you to death with long narratives. 
Nice selection of gear with many options to customize them
Good voice acting
Nice soundtrack

Cons:

SGWC2 is a definite improvement over previous games due to having long range contracts featuring 1000m+ shots (scopes allow you to aim up to 1700, technically). You get to account for wind, elevation, flight time and all the other fine things in life (lower difficulties feature a red dot aim helper that trivializes the first two aspects and helpfully shows if the bullet hit will be a kill). The challenges here are quite reasonable, if repetitive. ""Kill everyone without raising an alarm"" being the gold standard.

However, it's also plagued with classic contracts, which are, just that - [i]classic[/i]. Engagements below 300m, sneaking around, [strike]stupid[/strike] weird challenges (kill 10 enemy snipers with melee takedowns or kill 5 enemies by shooting grenades on their belts (this, obviously, makes everyone very alert and aggressive)) and all the other wannabe Splinter Cell elements. This was the entirety of all previous games, so it's not like SGWC2 became instantly worse for it.

Neither type of gameplay reaches Hitman Sniper/Splinter Cell levels of mindless fun and interactivity (In Long Range contracts there are not many objects to interact with and there are no opportunities for shots hiding bodies, in Classic contracts there are not many opportunities to stealth around or do some interesting gadget shenanigans). The game is quite serious about itself, which may or may not be a plus for you.

The AI is still questionable. It has hivemind detection, where any enemy you don't immediately kill alerts everyone to your presence and general position. The AI also often does stupid things like not leaving a disabled APC or just hiding in one place and never trying to reposition and flank you. These elements make the game that much easier but also that much duller.

Negatives: No plot this time around either, reassigning WASD still leads to trouble (the drone controls fine, but exiting a CCTV panel is still impossible if you bound ""Use"" to A), playing by the book is effective, but somewhat boring.

Graphically it's good and I have not seen any crashes.

What I mean is the lack of any real sniper long range missions. In fact the very first mission teases you with a long range shot going out to 3000m away but here in the game it barely scratches 1300m in most missions. I mean with that little tease you have an expectation that it would be longer and longer ranges. NOPE. Devs too lazy.

Whether this was a limitation of the engine or the devs just being lazy. The whole tease of the 3000m shot was completely dumb and stupid to even add in as it lead to nothing but blue balls and you NEVER shoot that far. It would have made for some amazing missions if they created missions that would slowly get farther and farther away or even beyond 3500m+, yet they don't it's a constantly rinse and repeat mix of either close range ~500m at best. Or 1000-1300m. How boring. I can probably create longer range shots in GTA5.

Not very epic if you ask me and for a game that doesn't even try to be that realistic, and takes a lot of liberties they missed a HUGE potential by not including MUCH longer range missions.

There is also some missions where it totally breaks immersion where you silently kill the target, no one fucking knows about it yet and some how an entire military spawns behind you near instantly REGARDLESS if you were silent or not.. Absolutely retarded. Who's the dumb turd that design that. No point in going silent then. So much for being a GHOST.

The only real reason to buy this game is for the shot camera, it's epic. That's about it. The overall game play is very rinse and repeat and the games inability to actually give more challenge in shooting at much much much much longer ranges makes it disappointing.

but lets get to should you buy this,,, if you want something that's kinda like Sniper elite well it works but the story isn't all that long and the missions can be completed on the hardest difficulty (dead eye) in about an hour if you trying to stealth kill everything, if you just kill and run about 30 min  on the same difficulty. (thats all I played on so your mileage may very.

the biggest time part of this is getting the achievements.

over all this is better then the first game cause you can switch your load out after each contract ""objective"" so if you kill a target or take/destroy something that is required in the mission you can vacate and switch what you have in your load out so if you need stealth for 1 section  and your gun doesn't have the special ammo you need to complete a challenge well if you don't need that medium/heavy rifle for your next part of the mission you can swap it out.

the down side is its SHORT and i mean short out side of me trying to get the achievements I could have most likely completed the story on dead eye in about 7 hours tops just doing what the mission said and saying F the achievements. 

Over all if you just want to take your time and pick people off there is 3 missions you can do that with some harder then others. if you want close quarters well there is a 3 of those as well. good load out options if you do all the challenges well  you have more then enough development points to spend on EVERYTHING.

The developers provide alright experience sniping but the game is entirely hamstrung by peripheral issues, namely the conversations of the sniper, the lack of available guns and the overall facile nature of the game. Thumbs down overall in consideration of the price and the cons of the game. It IS fun to play but not at this price point IMHO.  Worthy if you get it on sale.

PROS:

1.) Sniper contracts 1 was so poorly scripted it bordered on cringe-worthy. The whole ""seeker"" thing was vomit. You're a sniper, not a seeker. It was such shlock, as if you were this mystical creature. You're a sniper with an arsenal. The only thing that seeks are my bullets. This time around with SC2, it's better overall (but the actual conversations themselves are a total con - read below).

2.) The music meshes nicely with the missions, especially as you're pondering your next shot or scanning the environment for hostiles.


3.) The graphics are cryengine. Decent quality overall. My rig runs this  maxed out at 85 FPS. 

4.) A pro-ish aspect of the game are the various challenges in dispatching your enemies. You can kill targets with explosions, etc. This offers SOME variety but the challenges aspect is woefully under exploited.

5.) The developers attempt to create different scenarios of killing your targets by incorporating environmental aspects you can manipulate in the game. For example, shooting a control panel that will lower shutters creates an avenue for you to exploit. I will give credit to the devs but the overall setup is so painfully easy and obvious it doesn't require any great depth. 


CONS:

1.) The save mechanism for this game is convoluted. You should be able to save the game not only at key areas or after a key mission but whenever you are on the map. Negative. Instead it awkwardly saves the game at certain areas that I found out you can revisit by going to 'regions' and then reloading the game, at which point you're back at the starting area and the target is still alive. Just strange.

 EDIT: so apparently the devs did this on purpose to avoid people getting perfect setups and using saves to their advantage, or ""save scumming"". But I can still replay a contract, adjust and get rewarded with more money if I kill the target a different way and get steam accomplishments, so what's the point with their save mechanism? Still, it's a lopsided system. If I have to leave the game asap, I can't save my actual progress in the game. Besides, can't you do a new game, and follow the previous walkthroughs to achieve a better score?

2.) The compensation for killing people is a JOKE. 5,000 bucks to take out a target standard-style. 5k only? Are you a budget sniper? If you do one of the challenges and take out a target who's bunkered in as a sniper himself, you double that and get 10k. But then once you upload your data and get paid, you find out buying a fucking ACOG optics is 11k! In what world do you off someone over 1 KILOMETRE AWAY and get paid the price of a used 20 year old car and then be too poor to afford optics? No sniper rifle costs 75k either. The pricing system and compensation is just broken stupid. 

The cost is also PROHIBITIVE in comparison to the amount you get paid. If I get paid 15k max for a target, then why charge 11k for a red dot optics or worse, 20k for an extended mag? There is ZERO correlation to reality or at least to the amount you make killing. The price points vs. compensation is so broken, it's laughable.

3.) The .45 submachineh I wasted money on needs like 10 shots in order to drop a guy. It's a .45 - it should be dropping guys after 1-2 taps to the HEAD. Instead I have to empty half the mag in order to kill him. Just dumb. 

4.) The lack of available primary and secondary weapons makes things pretty limited, IMHO. If you're killing people from afar, there should be a greater variety of sniper rifles. There should be different types of sniper systems that would increase the longevity and replayability of the game. 

5.) The enemy AI is downright moronic. At first I was hesitant to hit a control panel with someone next to it because having the panel hit by a sniper round would be enough to arouse suspicion. But nope - I can nail the control panel from over a 1KM away and the guard looks at it as if it shortcircuited. I've also accidentally blown up a truck in shooting enemies and AI 20 metres away still patrol as if nothing happened. 

6.) The manner in which the challenges are shown is confusing, which is made worse by the save system. If you want to replay a contract, the game will put you at times next to AI (first map). It was only after replaying the same map but going after different challenges that I could confirm being paid additional money. Plus I was also worried that I would break my streaks or challenges by attracting attention to the enemy AI patrolling on the periphery of the contracts. Nope, doesn't seem so. 

7.) One of the game's BIGGEST flaws in my opinion is the lack of professionalism demonstrated in the scripted sniper's responses. Consider the following: you're on a mission, you have all the tech and armaments needed to kill someone 1.5 KM away. And then your character says the following: ""I missed the opportunity"" ""what should I do?"" ""this won't be easy"". What is the point in recreating a game that somewhat mimics sniper effects if the guy pulling the trigger is a beta male who shares his feelings over the comms? It's downright lame. After a while, it takes away from the gravitas of the game. 

""With all of this tech, it's not going to be easy. "" WHO SAYS THIS?


                                  *** If you're a SNIPER, ACT LIKE ONE. JFC ***

For me, this breaks the experience. 

Sorry, but immersion in a game like this (COD, Battlefield, etc) isn't just guns and graphics. It's the AUDIO and the conversations. It's the call signs, it's the official and legitimate communication taking place between operations.  It's the type of guns matched with the operators. All of this adds to the authenticity and experience of the game. SGWC2 fails this so badly with a poorly scripted protagonist.

Sniping mechanics remain solid.  My only complaint is the bullet cam intelligence is frustrating (you can just turn it off, which I did).  But so many setups involve doing several quick shots in a row to avoid detection that the bullet cam really gets in the way.  Some intelligence on the bullet cam trigger logic would be appreciated as its fun when its not in the way.

Level design is in general much improved.  I do like the long contract setup.  And they didn't overuse it by still having the classic mission setup.

The weapon loadout is much more interesting in this one.  The sniper rifles have a lot more character because the long shot rifles remain loud so you are actually making interesting choices in some cases rather than ""I'll just take this shiny expensive one that is better in every way"".

They redid the skill unlocks so that the anti sniper detection isn't a late game skill which is much appreciated.  Much less frustrating in this one then the first.

They seemed to have fixed the finicky lure rocks from cover.

The odd checkpoint system is still annoying and unpredictable.  It only gets in the way when your trying to do the challenges but boy is it annoying as hell there.

Enemy AI is still mostly dumb as a post but not in an un-fun way.  They weren't teleporting or doing some of the weird stuff they sometimes did in the first.",1627507214,1627507214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is Buggy but so are many others so it's forgivable to some extent but if you're looking for a game where you can play as a sniper then don't waste your money on this just buy Arma 3 and download the ACE3 mod for free its far more realistic than this will ever be...

This game is a blatant money grab and nothing else.

Good stuff:
- Missions were generally a good size, about an hour or so per individual mission for a slower player like myself.
- The challenge was good, and rarely unfair.
- When things are going well, it really can be good fun. Most of the puzzles are quite good.

Bad stuff:
- No manual save.
- ""Partial"" controller support means you can't play the game as it was meant to be played, if you're only using a controller. For example, you can't use the breath-holding element, which means that many of the missions become steeply harder with madly waving crosshairs.
- Partial controller support also means that your left-thumb D-pad presses will be ignored about 80% of the time.
- The HUD doesn't give any vertical element of placement, so that exfiltration point or that enemy might be several hundred feet higher or lower than you might think.
- Very little terrain differentiation, and some of the graphics (like flat trees) are just awful. There are also times where you'll try to drop maybe three feet off a ledge to a flat bit of ground, only to have the game treat it like an infinite fall (or maybe out of the game bounds?) and insta-kill you.
- Very little meaningful differentiation among weapons other than ""ideal range"" and amount of noise.
- In the same mission area, it's common to have enemies ignore the bodies of their friends right next to them, while enemies hundreds of meters away will notice your missed shots.
- The platforming controls are shaky. The game can tell you that a certain ledge is intended to be grabbed, but the game will miss the grab three times out of four.
- If you need to flee, but you are laying down, the game won't respond to the run button until after you've slowly made your way back to sitting (very different from most games I've played in this genre).

A lesser quibble, since it won't pertain to most players, is the inaccessibility to hearing impaired folks. With my hearing aids in, I still have to turn up my speakers very loudly to hear incoming grenades.

What good is recon when you cant tag anyone or when a tag goes away as soon as you tag a 2nd enemy. Useless BS and they didn't fix it from the first game.

Also annoying is seeing the same exact head shot kill scene regardless of where you shoot the enemy. I shoot them in the freaking chest and its a cutscene for a head shot. I try shooting them in the hand, same thing, another headshot scene. Seriously?? Its stupid.

This was a waste of money. I enjoyed the first game more  in regards to maps and enemy fights but this game was a cheap and quick throw together to get our money and then get out. You can already buy DLC  for this game buts its like, I just freaking bought the whole game which came with nothing and has bugs all over the place, why would I buy DLC for just cosmetics when you're not fixing the game play bugs.

WTF is wrong with these devs and why do they get away with selling us such mediocre crap instead of fixing / polishing their games. I wont be buying another title from this  company again unless this changes for real. What a shame, I actually enjoyed much about this series..

HOWEVER it is pretty fun, it just only has about 8-10 hours of original content assuming you don't get lost like I did. The level design is... not even good, it might be meh at best. The sniping mechanics are intuitive and easy to use. 

For the price I honestly can't recommend this game. Once you get through the first hour and a half you are a good way through the entire game. There's really nothing to upgrade to since they SEVERELY limit your customization options, so once you've earned your first 100k in game currency you've got everything you want. I'd say the game is worth about $15-25, I got it on sale and had a pretty fun time. It's not as good as pretty much any comparable AAA game, but if you're looking for sniper mixed with enemies having both map hacks, and completely being blind to your whereabouts if you're hiding in 2 inch grass it makes up for these shortcomings with good sniping mechanics. The assault rifles leave... honestly an impressive amount to be desired, it's almost like they took the worst guns they could think of, did no customization, handed them out to AI's who have either got shit in their eyes if they're within 30 feet of you, or have perfect aimbot from 100+ meters with a full auto AK.

Overall I'd say this game is a solid 5/10, wait a year or two and buy this on sale and it'll be a fun little diversion.

The only way this game has beyond a max of 12-13 hours of gameplay is if you want to completionist your way through achievements and frustratingly unclear 3 dimensional map design where some areas are clearly climbable but won't allow it, and others you can scale up like spiderman when there's genuinely no way in hell it's even remotely physically possible.

Anyway, I liked the ending (a bit better than Contracts 1 IMO). This lack of story may make you feel more like a ""contract killer"", without much information, but just focused on getting the job done for the money, which might be the whole point of the game. I noticed some minor bugs, that will likely be fixed in the upcoming months, but nothing important; no disappearing enemies in long range or anything like that.

I played a bit of the earlier games, and I wasn't very impressed. Buggy, awkward to handle, and often frustrating was the feel I got from them. I was hesitant to pick this one up. I'm glad I did. It looks beautiful, has pretty damn good sniping mechanics and fairly realistic behaviors for varying difficulty levels. I've spent most of my playtime on the second to highest difficulty and I'm fully enjoying the lack of ""crutch"" features like the dot that tells you where your shot will land. It's extremely satisfying to land a headshot at over a kilometer and watch the bullet collateral a second target by hitting the frag grenade clipped to his chest rig. There are rare instances where I felt the mechanics were inconsistent, most of my missed shots were due to simple errors like rushing a shot, not leading quite enough, or forgetting to set my scope's ranging properly when switching targets. The AI is pretty consistent too, and you often have to solve puzzles with your shooting by picking which targets to shoot in order, or which objects in the environment can serve to distract or slot problematic targets.

There are a bit of bugs in the game, like sounds getting ""stuck"" or silenced, a secondary target getting alerted when another is shot but they didn't the last 2 times you killed that target on a previous quicksave, or the very rare AI walking endlessly into a wall. These bugs were uncommon, not rare, but they did not ruin the experience.

My only complaints/wishes are for more guns (paid DLC for more guns, really? Big thumbs down on that) and polish the movement/bugs up a bit more. Hopefully they release more maps and weapons for free (or bundled maps and guns) down the line. That said, replay value was higher than expected. I'd appreciate a few scenarios where the enemy number and placement was randomized instead of fixed, but that would take a lot more design work because the current system is heavily reliant on fixed shooting puzzles. I'd also like more time on the mask features because as short as it currently is I rarely use them. Infinite (or very long) thermal vision would be very nice, everyone would enjoy feeling like the Predator while hunting down targets.

One last substantial and perplexing gripe I have... the remote recon drone is utterly useless. Don't buy the drone, don't upgrade it. It's useless most of the time and you can get by on the hardest difficulty without it anyway. In a few areas there is an anti-drone ""trailer"" that the enemy deploys which jams your drone. You have to shoot a control/fuse box located on the jammer itself, which may alert the entire camp if you haven't cleared out nearby targets. Any bullet will do, then your drone works again and marking targets with your mask is permanent instead of a couple seconds. Easy right? Well there's also anti drone ""towers/antennas"" scattered throughout the entire region that can't be disabled or destroyed and there's so many the vast majority of the map is covered by their influence. 90% of the time I thought ""Ooh my drone would be useful here"" or ""Let's spot a few close targets (the drone has a short battery life anyway) without revealing myself"", and big sad because there's drone jammers present. Why even have it in the game if it's always gimped?

Very fun game. Enjoyed my purchase.

Edit, SPOILERS BELOW:


You were warned.

I'm convinced ""Control"" tries to kill you immediately after you eliminate the final target. Why? After sniping a hidden guard through cover (discovered him on a completely silent clean run getting FUBARed by his rat ass) and then snapping to the primary target for a TRIPLE KILL SHOT, yet ANOTHER hidden guard spots the triple collateral and sounds the alarm. Control tells me that hostiles are closing on my position so I do a quick scan and see no movement. Footsteps. I spin around and dive into some bushes to hide myself, only to see there are 3 guards and a JUGGER about 5 meters away. W.T.F??? I crouch and start getting spotted... FROM BEHIND. Nearly 1,500 meters away, on the other side of the airport is a sniper crouched on a rock cliff that somehow I was unable to spot in my very paranoid recon phase. I kill him, and all 4 targets that are UP MY ASS, all completely incognito. Target dead and no need for stamina injectors (not that there ever is, another useless gadget), I swap for some tripmines. Cause now I'm really paranoid. Guess what? Another JUGGER and standard guard is waiting for me just down the hill. I plant a mine where I'm standing, retreat and flank in the bushes, then air assassinate the jugger. The last guard climbs up to where I was, neither were in alert states by the way, and steps on my tripmine. Now I'm PISSED. I go back to the sniping spot and slaughter everyone else at the airport. EVERYONE. I head to extract and finish the mission. I get a soppy speach from ""Control"" about how we are a good team and he might buy me a pint some day. BOI... I'ma slot you from D*CK TO NAPE YOU S*O*B.

...

ANYWAY... not sure if that's supposed to happen or if it's because I slotted everyone in the map, including the two ""civilian advisor"" ""Suspects"" in the first encounter. He called me sloppy when their skulls exploded. Whatever man, they were active agents aiding a double agent who's life I saved. Clean, silent kills, every last soul in that region. Pound sand Alex.

The biggest problem is that the game is separated into two ""sub-games"" that don't relate to one another in any meaningful way. You are either (1) positioned at long-range to snipe targets from a station; or (2) sneaking through a mission setup that inevitably leads to (1).

If you like the idea of sniping a few targets and then infiltrating to a new position, re-sniping and then moving in to the final kill-zone - well, you can't. There's no access to the long-range map. The game determines your play-style absolutely and it feels very confining and boring. Each setup is a repeat of the previous. I don't understand for the life of me why they made this design decision, but it is a terrible one.

In addition, the AI is horrific. The only challenge you will face is near-instant death from long-range if you mess up a shot and get bombarded by mortars or (worse) killed by auto-hit fire from enemies using machine guns 1800M away. Oh, sometimes enemies will teleport magically behind your kill station and attack you. Great. They are basically harmless but it is still annoying.

Finally, there are tons of weird animations that you get locked into, often with detrimental results. Climbing is a weird set of locked animations. Jumping off a ledge gives you a 1-2 second pause as you land dramatically. Good luck getting out of water quietly. This decision also kills the pace and, worse, often exposes you to enemies that are really just taking advantage of the fact that you are locked into some slow, unnecessary animation,

Sadly, this game is a step backwards in every way. I made the decision at 80 minutes to keep plugging away to see if it would get better. It doesn't. I would return it if I could but please let my sacrifice be your gain.

It's an OK game and those who are fans of sniper games will enjoy the gameplay and missions. There is a good degree of flexibility in how you complete the missions and I like the voice acting (is that Sean Bean?) but there are some pretty major flaws with the game. Firstly it's buggy as hell. You get caught up on scenery all over the place, especially when crouch moving. The player's movement is laughable, watch yourself float jumping :) The AI is dumb as hell which makes taking them down pretty easy (when they are front rushing your location for example). Swimming is very cluncky and you are not able to climb out in many of the very obviously simple places to leave the water, you have to go to certain locations to do this - it really is shoddy. The game itself is pretty short, I completed in 17 hours and I am sure better players can get it done faster, but there is a degree of replayability but the enemy always spawn in the same places so there are no surprises on a second play through if you have a good memory for sniper locations. DirectX crashes happen all the time which is annoying but the autosave feature typically means you can return right back to where you were. 

You can tell this game was rushed out, not a lot of quality control was done but I think with some bug fixes, updating the AI and randomising some of the enemy sniper locations could rescue this title. I also think it would be easy to add DLC missions to the game to increase the longevity. I'm not sure if I would pay for additional missions but I'd certainly give any free ones a go. 

In closing I would say that if you can get the game on a discount then it's worth it but I don't recommend it in it's current state.",1625979695,1625992677,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have some recommendations for the developers:
1) Melee attacks; 
 - sometimes fails for unknown reasons
 - take different length time which impairs negatively the player skillful utilization of the skill
2) Sprinting;
 - Sideways (left-right) should be enabled for better gameplay
 - The sprint doesn't automatically resume after an action even tho the shift key is engaged... which is a default that should be addressed in a patch
3) The climbing;
- The mechanics don't work as well as the one for Call of Duty... and makes it odd to use well... there is a delay in response time.
- the release of climbing needs more work too... we should be able to make a jump from a climbing position.
4) Picking items:
- the selection feels unstable when 2 or more enemies are piled up.
- the selection of collectables, Ammo stacks, etc... are often either not activating at the screen centre or have weird behaviours... 
5) The Aim action ""mouse right-click""
- Should have the option to behave differently according to the weapon. During long ranged shooting I felt that it was better to make it as ""toggle"" but during a normal mission it's way more convenient to have it as ""Hold"". But frankly, I think it would make more sense to have it ""toggle for the primary weapon and hold for the others...

It's fun just to explore the level and find various underground caverns and facilities or vent shafts that you took for granted in your previous play through. 

Sniping is extremely satisfying, and pulling off trickshots and trying to achieve the various optional challenges the games give you is a fantastic feeling especially when you see the bullet cam and the utterly obscene destruction.

The player has various sniper rifles, secondaries and pistols they can buy as well as an array of gadgets.

It looks good most parts and runs well. Sometimes feels like you're playing Hitman, which is a compliment, but it lacks soul.

First mission's sniper kills from afar were satisfying. Didn't have those in the second one though. I play with the red dot aiding my aiming because, well, I don't care enough to learn without it. Not yet at least. I guess learning to shoot without it would enhance my experience, this is a sniper game after all (or is it really?).  

It seems quite lengthy. My two missions took me about 8 hours and I see there's maybe 4 missions yet to come. AI of the guards is abysmal by the way or they are handpicked from a disability ward with poor eyesight. This may be because I play with 2/4 difficulty level though.

With that said,I would really love to see more openness in the nonlinear infiltration missions. Allow me to explain. In the second mission, there were multiple objectives on the map, however, they were all sectioned off from each other. This made the entire mission feel like a sequence of smaller side objectives instead of a cohesive whole. What if you could kill the primary target from the very get go? (although it should be very difficult) There should be more opportunities to snipe across another part of the map from a completely different section. I think sniper elite does this really well, every map was like a playground for you to experiment and find unique ways to snipe. To be fair, such a structure would be difficult to fit in the mission structure that CI has implemented, not to mention the technical difficulty of doing so. But even a little bit of openness can go a long way. For example, maybe have it so that at the very first location, a speculative player can take out some key defensive components at the far end of the map that would otherwise be difficult to take care of from a closer angle (i.e a proximity jammer) Or have it so that one part of the map will send in reinforcements to another section if you get spotted. I think having the entire map be cohesive like that would really complete this otherwise amazing game.",1625015508,1625015508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall pretty similar to the first Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts with much more stability in terms of graphics. Gameplay is relatively the same, including same skill-sets and similar weapons to choose from. For those who like stealth, sniping and lone-ranger type games, this is the game for you.

The game itself has high replayability for those who prefer to complete challenges. Challenges mainly includes how you kill the target with certain conditions to be met, Example: Killing the main target without any alerts triggered.

The game story is quite straightforward, being a sniper/assassin sent out to kill certain targets. However, the game feels extremely short and lacks ways to kill your targets, Example: Certain targets must be killed via long ranged sniper shots only. The bullet time slow motion effect is okay, but pales in comparison to the Sniper Elite franchise bullet time X-Ray kill cam.

The enemy AI is not too smart, similar to the first Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts. If they were more randomized and do not automatically trigger all other enemies upon detection, would be a great improvement (Example: Hitman franchise or Metal Gear Solid franchise enemy AI). More interactions with enemy AI should be incorporated similarly to Metal Gear Solid franchise, like shooting the enemy radio, shooting legs will cause them to flee and recuperate instead of killing them instantly as well as holding up enemies. 

The game uses an auto-saving mechanism that may cause problems to those whom prefer to test out actions and reactions of the game. A manual save feature should be made available for players like most games do in this day and age.

[h1]Bugs/Issues[/h1]
1. So far there are some issues with the sniping reticle, where the target ""dot"" moves around even when stationary, causing your shots to miss.
2. Compared to the first Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts, had not crashed even once during multiple playthroughs.
3. Rare cases when you load a map, the primary target does not appear (Actually waited up to 10 minutes, then realizing the main target does not appear at all). Reloading the map from last save fixes this issue.
4. Lots of random FPS drops for no particular reason (Using RTX2080 with no issue on other games)
5. Multiple times, main enemies do not drop objective items or unable to loot from their corpses (e.g.: Keycards), which is game-breaking. Reloading several times seem to fix this issue, but not all the time
6. Challenges unclear, and automatically shows failed even if all requirements are met. Had to reload MULTIPLE TIMES WITHOUT EXFILTRATING TO FINALLY UNLOCK THE CHALLENGE
7. Even all collectibles and challenges are completed, map percentage is stuck at 97%

[h1]Cosmetics/Customization[/h1]
Customization feels slightly lacking compared to the first Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts, such as the camouflage selection for the main character, Raven. It would be great if we can include multiple costume customization like adding Ghillie suits and other character accessories that can help boost the player's visibility against enemy AI (This had already been implemented by multiple games throughout decades, like Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater, Ghost Recon: Wildlands, etc).

Animations in this game is almost the same as the first Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts. If your character goes swimming, you cannot see the water physic effects. Seeing that this game is developed using CryEngine, this is a big disappointment. Overall the game physics feel lacking, hence, removing the realism feel of the overall game.

The choices of secondary weapons feel rather useless since many don't even have the option for silencers to be attached. Seems best to use the default secondary weapon and the bow should you choose to play stealthily.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This game is not for everyone, but is quite decent enough for people whom enjoy playing stealth games. Especially in higher difficulties, where you will require to use your own estimations to shoot down enemies as the targetting GUI is not available. Things that can improve the game includes having more maps of different terrains with different weathers, include more meaningful weapon types, more enemy types (Example: Enemy flying drones, etc) and better AI.

[h1]Overall Assessment[/h1]
Not the best, and not the worst stealth/sniper game there is. Not worth your money at full price, only buy when there is a sale. Extremely disappointed after multiple playthroughs.",1624428053,1624992664,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Now I would like to present you my detailed review.[/h1]
I was initially convinced of the game by the trailers. I have already played Sniper Elite 3 and Sniper Elite 4. I was especially interested in the realistic aiming of a sniper rifle: You have to calculate not only the distance, but also the speed of the wind into your shot. A game that is nice to play if you like to deal with the subject matter. That' s what I thought.
The developer also points out the many variants of killing an enemy in the trailers. In the game itself, however, this possibility is only given to a limited degree.

[i][b]For now, I have to note that I chose the second highest difficulty level.[/b][/i]
First to the positive experiences with the game:
When you get into the game, you are introduced to the game mechanics through a good tutorial. A credit to the developers for that. This is not a common thing in sniper games.
Also to be praised is the fact that this game does not support ""pay-to-win/play"". The DLC's are (as far as I could see), except for two, only paint jobs/skins for the weapons. So you don't have to invest several bucks in the game again to enjoy the full experience.

The in-game trailers for the jobs are also very inspiring. In terms of layout, they look similar to the Hitman series.
The arsenal of weapons is quite large. You have several sniper rifles to choose from as primary weapons, several machine guns (even a bow :-0) as secondary weapons, and several small caliber pistols as tertiary weapons. All of these can also be customized with attachments (silencers, (red dot) scopes, tactical flashlight, laser pointer, larger magazines and not to forget: different bullets (explosive, poisonous arrows for the bow), armor piercing, decoys. Besides, you have a wide range of gadgets (anti personnel mines, centry-gun, grenades, smoke grenades, and so on). Here you can really let off steam.

[b]Now to the negative experiences I encountered:[/b]
First, I would like to criticize the automatic saving of the game. I find that this is executed far too infrequently. There were moments when I was about to complete an intermediate objective and then had to load the last save point due to an error/death. The last save point was a while ago, so I had to repeat the last 15 minutes again. That frustrated me quite a bit. The developer could import a manual save option into the game, in my opinion.

Another shortcoming, which can also be added to the buffering, is the selection of your equipment. The game offers the player after completing an objective at a temporary ""safe-spot"" to adjust his equipment for the next objective or mission. The idea behind this is good. But for someone playing this mission for the first time, there is a small problem: you don't know what to expect at the next objective/mission. For me there were many times that I bought new equipment/ equipped something new, but then it was unnecessary in the new part of the mission. I would find it better if you could permanently modify your equipment on a certain point in the map, so can still quickly change afterwards.

[b]My biggest criticism, however, are the enemies in this game:[/b]
I don't know if I'm just too bad for this game, but I find the enemies way too strong. By that I don't mean their lives, i.e. what shots they can take, etc. I mean their behavior. First, they are under constant movement. For one thing, they are under constant movement. In some situations they move away just when the projectile is already on its way. In other moments they move permanently half a step to the right or to the left, which makes it difficult to hit their head.
I also find it annoying that in most cases two enemies are standing, walking or interacting together. This makes it difficult to kill one of them unnoticeably with the sniper rifle at long range without the other one being alerted.
And that brings me to my biggest problem: the game doesn't forgive a player for making a mistake.

[list]
[*] If you miss by what feels like an inch: You messed up or you were spotted/they are looking for you.
[*] If you shoot someone next to someone else: You've been spotted.
[*] If you shoot a power box near an enemy (which you have to do on certain missions) without killing that enemy first: you've been spotted.
[*] If you shoot at something high explosive: You have been detected.
[*] If you place or throw a anti personnel mine/ C4/ grenade/ anything that can be loud: You've been spotted.
[/list]

And the last two points made me especially sad and angry while playing. If you kill someone loudly, either by an explosive charge or by a non-silenced weapon, you are immediately hunted by all the enemies. It's especially funny when you shoot a gas can from a thousand meters and immediately every enemy knows exactly where you shot from (knows your position) within seconds. Interesting!

And then there are two possibilities how the opponents act: Either you are too far away (500 meters plus) and they shoot at your position with their rifles, these make 500+ meters... Simple rifles (I'd like to see those). As a comparison, an AK-47 can do around 200 meters, with different bullet flight direction. Oh, by the way: with battalion grenade launchers, they really fire you under the butt.

Or the enemies come in a 10-man rush and storm your position. In both cases, it's run for your life, but you better run fast.
That means: If you test your explosives in your inventory, don't be surprised if you become cannon fodder within the next few minutes. :)

Last but not least: 15 hours of gameplay for the full price of 40 $ adds up to just under 2.70 $ per hour. For that price, I think 6 main missions (with an average of 4 objectives per main mission) is too weak.
[b]So I would recommend you to wait for the next sale of the game.[/b]",1624978063,1624978116,False,6,0,0.521518290042877197,0,True,False,False

Story: Bad government vs 1 american and his slightly british voice in his head.

Gameplay: Shoot head, 50% chance to become a squished ketchup package. Body shots feel like airsoft.

Stealth:Get caught in a section that you wanted to fully stealth? EZ, press ESC and load last save, do it over and over again until you finally become the sneaky rat you always wanted to be.

Guns: Some are small, some are large, both can give quite the headache.

Length: Going on a shopping spree day with your mom to smoking a brisket. 8-12 hours long.

Opinion:Game is overall solid, occasionally I've gotten frustrated by getting spotted or getting stuck on a small rock, but when the solution takes less than 5 seconds to do, I feel no ploy. Story didn't feel stretched out, though I wish there was more interaction with the characters, rather than ""oi mate shoot that guy, congrats you saved the world"" sort of thing. 

Price: Developers have been trying to update their system for a while, if you feel that you want to support them, go ahead. Though I would wait for a sale, at most $40.

Bugs: Only thing's you will run into is slippery terrain, non climbable rocks, unable to climb a wall unless in a certain position and fall damage, you can fall from 5 metres but 6 metres? Say goodbye to a third of your health bar.

Pros:
+ Good visuals.

I've only played about an hour and im already frustrated and disappointed. Its little things too, like no fire mode selector between single and auto, and no ability to lean around a corner, you just have to stick your whole body out a corner to shoot at people. And it just feels like they force you to play the game a certain way with the essentially preset sniper perches you have to get to in order to take out targets, where as I enjoy the freedom to choose where I want to set up a shot and take out a target, more like SGW 3. The sniping mechanics are pretty descent, but IDK how you take that seriously in a game, then the rest just feels so arcadey. I'm a bit more of a hardcore tactical FPS guy so if you like the arcade like games like COD take what I have to say with a grain of salt, but its just very disappointing.

[h1][b] 📝Story/Plot without spoilers:[/b][/h1]
Play as Raven, a Contract World-Class Sniper Assassin against unjust international criminals. Scoot over regions of the Middle East located along the Lebanese and Syrian borders. Will you stamp a mark of success with your bullet or die as an unknown?

[h1][b]🎮Gameplay:[/b][/h1]
SGWC2 tries to achieve realism with an amalgam of good animations, high-tech gadgets and visually pleasing locations. And so far, it has succeeded the expectations.

[b]Controls-[/b]
Controls are a crucial aspect of any sniper game. They should be fresh and user friendly. If there is difficulty in controlling, there’s always a solution counter. Sniper absurdly wiggling? Change your stance to crouch or prone. Hard to know the distance between the enemy and you? Equip binoculars and adjust sniper scope. No idea where the bullet is gonna drop Use a bullet drop indicator. There’s a solution to everything. They are clean and easy to understand, no matter which difficulty you choose.

[b]Gamestyles-[/b]
It’s pretty obvious you will play as a contract assassin. But it does not restrict you to stealth or ambush playstyle. Yes, being too loud can decrease your chances of succeeding, as it will alert most enemies in the area, but that doesn’t mean the mission will reset. You are the one taking contracts, and all the risks are yours. You want to start with stealth, gather information and go berserk later? Go for it. I tried multiple playstyles, and each of them fit perfectly. But there are some flaws with the checkpoint selections. If you accidentally alerted the enemies and suddenly you see the autosave icon, well, you are screwed. All your stealth progress is lost because the last checkpoint will start with alerted enemies. 

[b]Variety-[/b]
Before playing the game, I was hoping that I don’t see super cyborg enemies that require 100 bullets to kill them. And thankfully, they didn’t spray the variety of fluid on the enemy element but consumed it well on playstyle locations. Each contract is a combination of sub-objectives that are entirely different from each other. Some might require you to blow up an illegal facility, infiltrate a convoy, protect a hostage, go underwater and find a laboratory or spread a virus across enemy motherboards. With each new objective, the sniping angles, the risks, the planning, the vibe; everything changes. It’s very easy to distinguish between mesmerizing contracts.
  
[b]Difficulty-[/b]
There was a prominent effort to categorize the mechanics with difficulty options. But at the end of the day, it feels shallow. Enemy consciousness was crazily random. Even in easy difficulty, they accurately guess your location if they hear a gunshot. But sometimes, you can just run behind them, and they won’t even notice you. So, at that point, the only difference these difficulties project is the variation in regenerating health, enemy damage and bullet hit marker. Other than that, it felt random in all categories.

[h1][b]📷Graphics:[/b][/h1]
Impressive and interactive. It has mesmerizing sceneries and a befitting colour selection. The same goes for level designing, except at some parts. During my playthrough, I was stuck at a minimal elevated land at least thrice. But as it is not groundbreaking, it can be ignored. Finally not able to see low poly textures is surely a treat. Astounding attention has been given to the semi open-world detailing. Would have been a cherry on the cake if they didn’t make cliffs slippery asf. I slipped at least 8 times from them and died.

[h1][b]📝Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]

[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Delivers what it promises.
    [*]Good variation in content.
    [*]Diverse arsenal of weaponry and equipment. 
    [*]Astonishing graphics.
    [*]Smooth gameplay with action-packed encounters. 
    [*]Patience and planning pays.
    [*]Slo-mo exploding heads.
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Random enemy awareness. 
    [*]Slippery cliff edges. 
    [*]Only 5 contracts.
[/list]

[h1][b]🏷️Tips to new players:[/b][/h1]
Water is your enemy. If you are spotted while in water, you are pretty much dead, as you can’t use your weapon. Listen to the enemy conversation as it might help you identify if the enemy will leak information during interrogation. Aim for the neck of heavy armor enemies. Always Have At Least One Silenced Weapon.

[h1][b]✉️Miscellaneous Information:[/b][/h1]
[b]Info about DLCs-[/b]
All are just gun skins or weird weapons. Seriously, how many skin DLCs do they want? Is this Fortnite? Don’t waste any penny on these. 

[b]Skills/Perks and Shop-[/b]
They are the grindable elements of the game. Upgrade your equipment stats, their behaviour or even your personal combat mastery. Or just buy a better weapon from the store.

[h1][b]😇Honest Rating:[/b][/h1]
It has its flaws, but overall, it’s pretty amusing. If you follow the game like it’s meant to be played, it’s the best experience. But if you just recklessly ambush every facility you see, you might miss the charm. According to the provided content, the asking price is slightly above the fair mark. So, wait for a sale!

Story, terrain, variety and approach are all much better in the first game.  Which leads me to my major gripe about this one - it held my hand WAY too much.  Sure, there was an open map in front of you, but the game pretty much forces you to do what it tells you in most cases.  One of my favorites parts of the first game was planning against the map, and then coming up with unique approaches.  That sense of discovery is gone with this one, and I think my enjoyment suffered for it.  I almost felt like I had a cheat code on.

With Contracts subseries I think they found their winning formula. Contracts 2 is one of the best stealth games I have played in years.
Gameplay consist of eliminating targets across 5 different regions and completing other side challenges and bounties. You might think 5 regions don't sound like much, but these are all huge, very well designed locations with multitude of objectives.
You have some classic stealth em' up missions that require sneaking into base to plant explosives or collect something. These are great and varied with pretty solid AI, that actually have peripheral vision (looking at you Far Cry). 
Exciting new addition to the formula are long range contracts. These are similiar to the sniping missions in Hitman games, but are way better. Each one is like a puzzle, that requires precision and planning ahead to isolate your target or cause an accident to mask your kill. Thing is that hitting a moving target over 1200 meters is very risky, so you have to wait for opportunity to take a shot or create one. I had immense fun with these, especially the one where you had to free the prisoner and cover his escape.
I love the new variety of weaponry available. Sniper rifles themselves come in 3 flavors: Light, Medium and Heavy. Distinctions between these are not just for show. Ligth rifles are the most quiet and have additional short range reflex sight. Heavy ones are the cannons necessary for long range contracts. They don't use suppressors, but are the only ones able to hit long range targets and can use bipod for more stability. Medium rifles are kinda in-between previous two.
I immensly enjoyed the sniping mechanincs! I am playing on the highest difficulty and each shot has to be considered carefully, taking into account wind and distance. CI Games found a sweet spot between realism and game mechanics. Landing these 1300 meters shots feels so gooood!
There are pretty substantial upgrades to your character and equipment, that can change your approach to each mission a lot. Some of the more difficult challenges require certain level of specialization and you won't be able to buy all upgrades by just playing through the game once. I like it cause it demands you make some tough choices when picking upgrades.
Overall Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 is the best we have seen from CI Games and one of the most fun I had with game in last year. With its budget pricing, lots of content (not close to being done after 15 hours) and solid performance on my GTX 1070 I strongly recommend it to any stealth games fan. If you like sniping games - its a must play, basically best in the genre. Rebellion will have a tough time topping this.

I felt like Robin Hood, with a 50 Cal, it was nice. One thing I like about the game, is how the missions aren't as linear as expected. I didn't really use the drone because the jammers were common everywhere, and I did one bounty, but their intel didn't add to my total, but i'm just gonna mark that on my bad luck or not understanding the instructions because I pretty much did MLG level quickscopes for standard enemies, and was speeding through half the game.

I have died more from falling off cliffs than the enemy, but that's expected when trying to be a ninja sniper guy. Heads exploded very nicely. Very solid game, price is nice.

For instance, I had a turret notice be, but did not engage just yet, so I hid in the grass until it cooled down. But 1 minute goes by, 2min, 5, 10min?! It just doesn't cool down. So I am forced to reload my last save.

The first mission, so far, seems to be the only mission that really requires you to be a ""sniper"". For a sniper game there really aren't a lot of maps that have you taking out targets all that far away. In fact, after the first mission all the missions were within less than 500m. The first mission was taking shots over 1km, which was awesome. It took some clever thinking and good timing to get the shot right where I needed it to go.

Since then, however, the game has become a stealth game. Yeah it's ok as far as that goes but I bought this expecting a bunch of huge maps that require me to make a perch somewhere outside of enemy detection while also lining up my sights onto a target.

Instead, I get this mediocre story that requires me to break into a complex to get some files, or whatever. I wanted to be a sniper, not a spy. This is basically Hitman without the disguises and with more realistic guns. I mean just look at the achievements for this game: not a single one like ""hit a target from over 2km away!"".

They're mostly ""complete mission..."", don't get spotted during this escape, blah blah. Get all the guns in the game which are 90% useless. All the rifles with long range become totally useless after mission 1. The best gun in the game is the one with maximum noise reduction so that you can be almost next to enemies but be able to snipe someone a couple hundred meters away.

Idk, it's ok. It has a lot of the same issues the first game had but I foolishly thought this one would do something different. There were times where I genuinely thought I was replaying the first one because I swear some of these maps are identical to the first game.

EDIT:

OKAY, after several of the most hilarious crashes, I cannot recommend this game. During a cutscene, the ones where you take a shot and it does a slow mo pan to the guy you shoot, I accidentally pressed a button and the character model moved a bit and then a game just crashes.

This is after the dumb level design of one of the missions having two AI machine guns pointing into the office you have to break into in order to disable security have broken my cover for what is probably the 5th time.

IDK man, this same stuff happened in the first game and I thought they would have fixed it since then. They didn't.

There is 5 maps, total. The idea is, you run those 5 maps ad nauseum, trying to get every challenge etc ticked off the list. 6 if you count the tutorial map but who does that.

Long range sniping, sure. 1000m+. But that is also the ONLY way you can interact with those outposts. You can't walk there. These outposts are outside the map, in a way. This, I don't like at all. Give me the option of how I approach a situation. 3 of the maps has these long-range outposts so fit a scope accordingly. 

I don't find the sniper rifles to have that much personality. Either it is silenced or not, silenced a lot or a little and damage goes up or down per bullet. Besides those 2 stats, I don't notice any difference.
Assault rifles, pistols and the shotgun are the same way. Either you want silence or damage. Not every gun can fit a silencer either.

You can melee-kill the enemies. Interrogating can mark the nearby enemies for you. Other than that, I don't see the point of interrogation.

Overall, this should be a 30 € game. Not much there. Story is thinner than ice, variation is non-existant, NPCs spawn at same spots every time. They move the same routes. They react the same, which means, when they detect you, they will shoot at you and then approach you in a train. Only exception is the snipers, they don't move from their spot more than a couple metres, if at all. And AI are blind as bats, except for the snipers and the ones with binoculars. I was in crouched position on a road, 2 enemies approach me 30 metres away, if even that. They never noticed me!

Až na slabou AI je hra zábavná,lokace jsou rozmanité a pocit z odstřelování je parádní. Hra cílí na znovuhratelnost jednotlivých misí,takže není problém hrou proběhnout za nějakou hodinku,pokud jen zabijete svůj cíl a přesunete se na další lokaci.Pokud však hrajete čistě stealth a vystřílíte celou základnu,aby nezůstali žádní svědci,počítejte,že po prvním průchodu necháte ve hře 20H+.Hra běží na Cryenginu,takže audiovizuální stránka hry je na hodně dobré úrovni,jediným záporem hry je divná AI,místy hloupá,místy přechytralá. Není problém narazit na vojáky,kteří po alarmu stojí na místě a zapomenou na svou trasu či úkoly,stejně jako není problém narazit na vojáky,kteří přes 5Km mapu vidí ze kterého křoví se přesně střílelo.Až na tento problém a nemožnost si hru ukládat sám,je však hra zábavná a nabízí důstojné odstřelování na velkou vzdálenost 😉👍
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Except for the weak AI, the game is fun, the locations are diverse and the feeling of sniping is great. The game aims at the replayability of individual missions, so it is not a problem to run the game in an hour, if you just kill your target and move to the next location. However, if you play pure stealth and shoot the entire base so that there are no witnesses left, count on leaving 20H+ in the game after the first pass. The game runs on Cryengine, so the audiovisual side of the game is at a very good level, the only downside of the game is the strange AI, sometimes silly, sometimes overly. It is not a problem to come across soldiers who stand still after the alarm and forget about their route or tasks, as well as no problem to encounter soldiers who over the 5Km map can see from which bushes were accurately shot. Except for this problem and the inability to save the game yourself, the game is fun and offers a dignified long-distance shooting 😉👍

I still recommend this game because it's fun. Too easy for me. I was hoping for a tougher challenge.
Nevertheless, a very good choice for people starting to master the art of sniping or casual gamers.

I forgave all the bugs and the poor design and the completely unintelligent AI of all the other games in the franchise, simply because I just liked the stealth aspect and the sniping.
Even Contracts 1, which was quite poor, still gave me a lot of enjoyment.
However, Contracts 2 is very disappointing. I won't repeat the poor reviews from many other players covering:-
 
  Lack of content 
  Poor map design  
  Micro Transactions 
  Linearity of the map areas
  Poor Game Saving design
  No real variety in the weapons
 I could just about forgive all that, but what killed this game for me is the AI of the NPCs. This has always been a problem in this franchise. I remember reading complaints about the original Ghost Warrior(s) where killing an NPC alerted the whole base instantly, and they knew exactly where you were located and could shoot you dead from a 1000 metres away with an AK47.
You would expect in the 21st century and after so many iterations of the game that CIs Developers would have got it right by now, but no, exactly the same thing is happening in contracts 2. 
I won't labour the point too much, everyone knows the problem. You are hidden in vegetation 1400 metres away from the target, you shoot an NPC silently, instantly, the hit is detected and the whole base is alerted telepathically. Not only that, they know exactly where you are and can shoot you dead from 1400 metres away with an AK47 with no bullet drop, genius.
This is immersion killing for me and I cannot forgive it any more, there is no excuse for such primitive, unsophisticated AI behaviour as it exists in this game. I play a lot of The Division 2, CI Developers should check it out, it has some of the best NPC  AI I have ever seen in a game.
To finish, I asked Steam for a refund but they refused. Reason being that I tried to give the game a chance and exceeded the 2 hour play limit in Steam's Terms & Conditions. So now I am stuck with this game even though I will never play it again.

The most major issue I have encountered is the AI instant-spotting. For some reason, under certain conditions, soldiers/cameras/whatever can instantly spot you and engage you. My worst example of this is when I peeked out of cover ~15m away from a shotgun wielding soldier, he instantly spotted me and shot me, causing full alert status and taking nearly a quarter of my HP instantly. (there have been other circumstances where spotting has been... odd. Turrets infinitely spotting me with no increase in the 'reveal bar' is another good example of buggy spotting.)

My second issue mostly has to do with the AI and might be due to the difficulty I was playing on (2nd highest) so take that in mind. Getting spotted for me was a instant-reload affair on nearly every occasion because soldiers reacted nigh-instantly to my spotting. The delay being spotted and the soldier shooting/yelling was easily less than 0.2s on the majority of occasions. This, combined with the instant spotting, created circumstances where I was spontaneously forced out of stealth mode and sometimes instantly killed by the sheer amount of damage taken.

As a whole, I actually really love this game. The sniping mechanics are excellent, the guns (even the dinky handguns) feel great to fire, and the settings are interesting and varied. If these issues get addressed/adjusted I'll likely come back to it, but until then, I can't enjoy it.",1623685052,1623685052,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Sound - two things a) You cannot always tell were the sounds is coming from or how close.  Its better than the original but still pretty bad.  b) Bullet/gunfire noises.  When you are being shot at from a distance, you hear the bullet hit (or wiz by your head) BEFORE you hear the rifle retort.  Geez, shooting 101.
2) Weapon mods - just buy the one scope that gives you the maximum range of zoom and the maximum distance capability.  That will last you all missions.  Don't bother with the 50 cal.  All the guns have basically the same ballistics.  Better to get a suppressor.
3) Stealth, its unclear what is stealthy and what is not - it seems if you miss, everyone knows exactly where you are (even if you are 1000+ yards away - with a supressor).  It doesn't take much away from the gameplay, but it is one avenue that might be fun.

Missions are good.   The 'open' world is one that pretty much guides you (mountains and cliffs keep you on path).

i don't get the negative reviews, the AI in this game is no worse and in some areas better than AAA title AI, and from a smaller dev no less. it can be frustrating being pinpointed in absurd situations but firstly, you can do missions in complete stealth, secondly, i think its more of a balancing issue as i have been 'spotted' but still killed everyone at the base as they were still a mile away from me, and thirdly, it will no doubt get better in the future which is more than what i can say about other titles.

the gameplay is fun, the weapons are plentiful and customisation is a breath of fresh air based on other modern shooters, it really gives off a 'GR future soldier' vibe from the way you can manage your loadout pre mission but better.

the writing and story is really well done too, honestly the negative reviews are kind of absurd they left me thinking i would be refunding this but i most certainly didnt want to, i am only 4 hours in and i am having so much fun, it really is a hitman/splinter cell/sniper elite crossbreed.

a few things other than AI alertness that I would like to see improved on are actually the visuals, the graphics are really nice maxed out but its little details like terrain fidelity at very long ranges when you are scoped in and also shadows not rendering at extreme ranges too, things which i could forget about in other games but being a sniper game, 'zooming in' is part of the mechanic so...

Game itself isn't that long or complicated. You can blow through the campaign in like 5 hours or so if you go guns blazing. Getting all the trophies however might take some time especially with how buggy some of the challenges are.

There are only 5 missions / areas, enough for a single evening of fun. If you're the type that is happy to pay $40-50 for a game that lasts an evening, you might disagree. The gameplay is pretty good, very similar to Far cry 4 but with several layers of in-depth sniping mechanics and very graphic slo-mo kill shots. There are fewer weapons than I expected for a weapon-centric game, especially having bought a weapons expansion pack with it. Again, enough for a single evening or maybe a few evenings, but I just didn't find it very re-playable for the cost and it didn't keep me hooked because there's not much variety or much to chase after playing through the initial story (which was very superficial). Also kind of buggy. I got stuck in the terrain a lot and the aiming /reticle was also buggy and focused on the wrong distance frequently even when no obstacles were in the way. It treats wispy blades of grass like solid objects so you can't throw mines from cover consistently because they just stick to the grass, as if a blade of grass could hold up a 10 lb mine. Needs some polishing.  I also got annoyed with the voices, which are very repetitive. The dialogue and the player costume are embarrassingly unrealistic.

That said my last sniper game was Sniper Ghost Warrior so I've been away from the franchise a long time. I feel the entry price is worth it. Took me about 11-12 hours to complete all missions on 2nd highest difficulty. 

Graphically it's nice, the areas offer enough landscape variation, lighting looked good and so on. I did encounter some graphical bugs along the way though but nothing too obnoxious. Felt maybe the faces etc could've looked a bit better though when they're exploding apart. They can look a bit flubbery?

Sound is good, long range rifles have a nice punch when it goes into the bullet time cut scenes. I do think it's odd though that even a silenced rifle still has a similar sound on bullet time cut scenes, it could just be the sound of the cut scene starting with the deep 'whoosh' kind of sound, but it's a little strange, but nothing that subtracts too much.

Enemy types are all pretty samey from region (level) to region. You have the regular soldiers, Officers (which lets face it, are basically the same thing as I didn't seem to notice much different between them and the others), heavy & snipers. There's also some automated turrets but that's about the extent of it. 
Some of the AI behaviour baffled me, such as being 1km+ away from the enemy but still having them turn to face and shoot in my general direction at me (or actually at me) if I missed a shot or took someone out that caused them to be put on alert. That needs a bit of work/adjustment I think, there's certainly ways to avoid this by making sure you land your shots and choosing the right timing for them etc but it kind of breaks immersion a bit when a whole entire base suddenly goes on high alert and all swing to look at you immediately.

The regions are all fairly varied and enjoyable and there seems to be some challenges that you can do if you're an achievement hunter which'll add some replayability, but not THAT much I don't think. I think you should be able to mess with your load out after you get the cut scene for that region mission. You can read the challenges and mission details, but in doing so you basically have to listen to a verbal explanation practically repeating the written mission details. 

The story is nothing amazing as it is fairly standard FPS story telling. Not a lot to it and fairly bare bones, but there's enough to keep you doing what you're doing and that's killing people and blowing sh*t up. It's not like most people would pick this sort of game up expecting something award winning, lets be real.

I found myself not using that many of the gadgets or items throughout the game apart from the odd grenade or health kit. I'm sure some people would enjoy setting some of these up and messing about with them but it wasn't for me. The guns I don't feel you're going to get much out of. You use the short range when its a classic mission and a long range when it's a long shot. There's some options there but for me nothing really stood out and they kind of felt relatively similar from one to the other.

Again, not having played a Sniper game from the franchise for a while (nor any of the Elite sniper series), this was something that felt familiar being FPS but varied enough to engage me. A few small graphical glitches along the way and some weird AI behaviour here and there but overall an enjoyable experience.

I didn't really see any real difference between the difficulty levels. Enemies behaved the same, and damage seem to be the same, the only thing that really changed, was the sniping. On easier difficulties, you get a little red dot in your scope to shoot after, and on the hardest you get less HUD, most of which isn't really needed anyway.
I had to turn bullet cam off after a while. It became a distraction when combined with the turret. Sometimes, timing is key to not alert anyone, and the bullet cam ruined that a few times for me.
I ended up just using a single sniper with an ""Extreme long range"" scope, and a silenced machine gun and pistol. When you get the perk to be able to run silently, you don't need anything else.

I guess I just expected more from this franchise.

This game is worth playing if you really enjoy stealth game play or long range sniping. Nothing is wrong with the game there.
The problem is when you start playing on Dead eye.
Enemies will spot you across the map if you're simply walking.
They will spot you through cover or instantly start firing at you if even one thing is off.
I'm not sure if some of these aspects were designed this way or not.
One thing I know for sure is that specifically, I had a bug that when I was reloading I alerted an enemy and that one specifically enemy stayed alert through every reload and would instantly start shooting at me from 1500M away, at any reload point. I'm like, when I'm walking up to when I was about to clear the base.
This is an obvious bug, and I hope to replicate it so that the problem can be seen by the Dev team so they can fix it.
The game isn't bad, it's enjoyable as long as you don't encounter any type of bugs or weird BS.
Such as an enemy teleporting through the side of a wall and instantly alerting you.
Or, and enemy that is stuck in the ground that is instantly alerting you.
A lot of the problems come from small bugs and glitches that over time will be fixed.
I feel like Sniper Contracts 2 is a step above the last game.
All the advertisement from Pros is quite annoying but I understand wanting to make sure your game gets out there.
The microtranscation weapons are extremely annoying because most of them are really good, and would be super useful if you could just buy them.
The only time that I've struggled with bugs,glitches, and general errors or problems with the game is on Dead eye. Which isn't surprising because you need to do everything perfectly to pull off complete stealth in the hardest mode. ( No Surprise )
However, it is. Really, annoying to be maxed out in stealth. Stealth tree and all, and be spotted instantly after firing a single shot, and having an enemy detect it through a wall that is roughly 30-40M away.
Or, the real problem i've been facing. Having the .50BMG ammo from snipers not be able to double chest shot and kill people. Listen, why is it that the medium sniper and the light sniper are able to do this but the one that does the most damage cannot? This doesn't make sense. The values for the Heavy sniper when double chest shotting people needs to be looked at.
I had so many problems when I was aiming for a Headshot - Body shot on the next person with the .50 that I cannot even explain how frustrating this way. And do not tell me to use AP ammo when you can simply just use a medium sniper and do it without the ammo.
I apologize for the first troll review.
But a lot of aspects of this game are extremely frustrating on deadeye because its so silly.
I understand the enemies needing to be heightened and alerted when mistakes happen. But you can do everything right, not have any issues at all. Use proper Cover & Concealment. Good spot placement and absurd reaction time and still come out on bottom because the response time - to detection time of the AI on Deadeye is super human.",1622988864,1623445187,True,0,0,0.499759823083877563,1,True,False,False

If you assembled a crap PC it's not fault of the developers!
Play the game as originally planned ( I mean in a stealth way ) and avoid "" John Rambo "" actions and you will get the best from the game.
I run the game very smoothly in every screen resolutions ranging from HD to 4K. ( ...But in 4K you have to slightly reduce the video settings otherwise playing on "" U:LTRA "" you'll get some slowdowns here and there ).
The best option is to reduce the AA at the minimum ( High AA settings are pretty useless in 4K due to the already very good image/resolution aspect )

To the Developer:
I appreciate the quick response and opinion. The Bugs' I experienced in this game, and the first SGWC, are well documented under the Steam discussion forum. Under both games and from Multiple people, not just myself. They were never addressed and never fixed. I have a post in there now, asking for help to no avail. 
As far as the game being a DLC or a ""New"" game, this is just my honest opinion. Don't take it personal.. I'm just not seeing it, the ""New"" parts. 
I probably would like the second region... However the major bug I was experiencing, would not allow me to advance to the second region.

A. I consider First-Person Perspective (FPP) to be the idiot step-child version of something you know to be superior, i.e. Third-Person Perspective (3PP). No matter the franchise or the effort put into the game itself, FPP will always carry the stench of a poverty-spec, poor-man's alternative to a proper, 3PP gaming experience. This goes for Cyberpunk 2077, Far Cry 5, and Resident Evil 8. This game is no different.

B. I have only played this particular Sniper: Ghost Warrior (SGW) game, so my perspective will be that of an entirely new demographic. If you are an SGW fanboy, this review will not be pleasant.

C. As much as I enjoy Metal Gear Solid V, Ghost Recon: Wildlands, and The Division, I'm not really a mil-sim shooter kind of gamer. I do appreciate weapons design and details but not to the point of drooling over purely cosmetic skins, whether earned or bought.

Now for the actual review, starting with the bad stuff and finishing with the good stuff (Psychology 101, right?) I'm on PC using mouse/keyboard, and I paid full price.

THE BAD STUFF

1. Raven is an expert sniper and, presumably, trained in the best Special Op unit that springs to your mind. Sadly, he also has the stamina of a middle-aged couch potatoe who smokes 30 cigs every day. And you can't upgrade his stamina. You can only speed up stamina regen or use a consumable item (stamina booster). For God's sake, even Dark Souls allows for stamina upgrades! And those guys are notorious for ""no handholding"". Maybe CI Games (CIG) decided that no stamina upgrade was somehow more ""immersive"" or ""authentic""? It isn't. It just makes CIG look like clueless amateurs.

2. The Bullet animation is clearly a ""unique selling point"" - I'll gladly admit it was one of the reasons I decided to buy Sniper: Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 (SC2). And it is quite impressive - the first time you see it. After that, it gets ridiculously old ridiculously fast, to the point where I disabled it in the settings after the 3rd or 4th animation and never considered enabling it again.

3. Even with no prior experience with this franchise, and given that SC2 is a condensed and focused version of SGW 3 (the ""Contracts"" in the title), I have to say the game is surprisingly short and almost devoid of any kind of story. Wolfenstein Youngblood is actually longer (and also vastly more annoying). I took 19 hours to finish SC2, and I'm a filthy casual with poor motor skills. And I feel I've been massively short-changed. Most uploaders and streamers on YouTube and Twitch will finish this game in 5 to 6 hours. I hope they received a free copy or at least didn't pay full price...

4. CIG need to shell out the extra Euro (or Zloty) and hire an English-speaking proof-reader. It's one thing to endure the parodic dialogue or clownish outbursts from enemies, but the typos and the bad grammar in the collectible documents are very painful to sit through. As mentioned above, there is next to no story or background in this game, and the few tidbits to be found are butchered by sloppy quality control. I know CIG is a ""small studio"" - they keep saying that when responding to Steam reviewers - but that's no friggin' excuse at this price point and after all these years of making sniper games.

OK, now for the good stuff:

5. SC2 is centred on a handful of isolated regions. This is not a Fallout 4-style, open-world extravaganza, so if that's what you're expecting - well, check the title one more time. This structure actually works surprisingly well to give you an idea about what sniping entails. And apparently it entails lots of patience, lots of sitting/lying and just waiting for the target to move to a position where he/she can be successfully negotiated. Mind you, I have no military background so I can't really pass judgment on the authenticity of the missions, but as far as ""immersive gaming experience"" goes, SC2 does offer some great moments.

6. While the missions may seem copy-paste at times, the regions are sufficiently varied as to be memorable - the Hellström region particularly so, but maybe that's because I really wanted to kill that smug Swede. The Long Range missions do suffer from the fact that you can't really interact with enemies - you're positioned 1 to 1.3 kilometers away - so your experience is limited to sniping out targets until the mission is completed, and then get up and leave. But I assume that's what sniping is fundamentally about, so I don't consider this a weakness in SC2.

7. If you can accept the isolated, contract structure of this game, I think you'll find it quite entertaining, and with 4 difficulty levels and a host of mission challenges (some of which will require you to replay contracts several times), there are lots of reasons to get this game - ON SALE! As much as I ended up liking SC2, I still find 40€ a bit too ambitious on the part of CIG - small studio or not.",1623274511,1623337717,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[*]Like its predecessor, Contracts 2 is not very challenging, even if you play at the highest level.
[*]Also (as with the predecessor) the story, even if it is only incidental to the fun of the game, is not very well done and is more reminiscent of a classic 0815 bad people do bad things story.

- Game is very short, you could quite easily do all 5 missions in less than 5 hours
- A couple of very small bugs that can be annoying - although nothing game breaking
- Story starts by telling you the record shot is over 3km but then never gives you a chance to make that kind of shot
- Mediocre close range (non sniping) combat, but this is often avoidable if you take your time and scout the location before entering and snipe them with a silenced sniper.

Positives
- A very well made sniping experience
- Nice variety of different weapons for different play styles - although the focus is generally for a stealthy approach
- Nice mixture between extreme long distance shots (>1km) and shorter range (<500m)
- Very smooth gaming experience, very few bugs, with no actual game breaking bugs
- Nice variety of mission types [overwatch as someone tries to escape, kill person x, take out infrastructure, find object x in area]
- Possible to change out equipment during a level when you are between objectives

All in all this feels like a very well made game, great for anyone looking for a thorough sniping experience not too dissimilar from the Sniper Elite series.

I have only played the last three Sniper games so I really cannot tell you how the series progressed since the beginning. However, starting from Sniper Ghost Warrior 3, the series has defiantly taken leaps and bounds. Do not get me wrong, I beat SGW3 (and enjoyed it myself, even with its flaws), and I know I will be beating Contracts 2. I could not beat the original Contracts. Not sure why, outside I just became bored while playing. Sniper shots in that game felt like something a M4 could do. But here, in Contracts 2? Lol! Naw! This game comes with the distance, and I REALLY appreciate it. Shots feel satisfying when done proper. Head shots have been given the extra, in extraordinary, with how the head reacts when a large enough caliber goes through it. Not even joking, if you played RDR2, when you first skin an animal in that game, remember when you dropped jaw at the detail that went into that? Same here, but with head shots! 

One thing most games get wrong, and irritates me to no end, is the weapon's sound effects. Does it sound right, or at least beefy? Reload animation look good? Or how about trigger discipline? I'm happy to say, Sniper Contracts 2 NAILS it! Weapons feel good to shoot, reloads are good (although, I do wish Raven would use a tactical reload.. At least when things are heated). But all in all, I am happy to say, from pistols all the way up to the actual snipers, everything feels right, feels good! And that finger stays off the trigger until needed.

Graphics actual blew me away to be honest. I did not think an upgrade like this would happen between Contracts, and Contracts 2. I love it. The best ever? No. But imo gorgeous none the less. The sounds when running on dirt VS concert are very distinct, as a bird chirps in a tree near by, and you cannot forget the sun rays slicing through the limbs on that very tree. It all sounds and looks great! Good job! 

Story
Really, out of the three Sniper games I have played, only SGW3 really tried to have a story to follow. It wasn't deep, but it tried. It even threw in some twists here and there to throw you off a bit. I know some say they do not care for a story in this type of game, but I am one of the ones who do. Contracts 2 has a story to follow, but it is literally bare bones. Here is bad guy, take out minions, go after bad guy. I do want to take the time and state, I appreciate having something over nothing. I just hope they give the story some effort next time. 
Doesn't have to win any awards, but something I would be at least interested in listening to. Add in some stakes, maybe a twist here or there, having the feeling of needing to win never hurts (unless acted poorly). But if they match the acting I have heard so far in Contracts 2, they will be just fine. This game has the best acting to date. Although I haven't heard all conversations, so far, the conversations I have listened to sound good. No complaints. 

Issues
So the BIGGEST, and actually only gripe I have is optimization. I have a 3070 and somehow, I drop usually five, upwards of TWENTY frames randomly. Is it consistent? No. But enough to write about it. The stutter really breaks immersion. I am running the game on high settings (one below max), and still the frames drop. To be fair, I did not see other reviews bring this up, so it may just be me. 

UPDATE
Just checked my drivers, needs an update. Crossing fingers it is my stupidity! Ill update my review as soon as I play again. 

UPDATE 2
Sadly, still FPS drops. So it seems some maybe unlucky like me. 

After Completion 
Later in the game, bugs became more common. Just want to throw that out there. That being said, CI did an awesome job I have to put that out there. I also want to give ideas I think would really add to Sniper and hope to see it implemented in future installments. I think CI could add some quality of life to improve our experience for the next game. My ideas, tactical reload would be great! Separate reload for normal shooting VS more high octane moments. Also, check mag feature. I would say give an option to get rid of hud, bullet counter, and allow us players to really get immersed. Checking our own mags, making sure we are listening to anyone around us and forcing us to know our surroundings (these are optional of course, from the settings). I think these would intensify the game ten fold to be honest. 

I will say it again, I REALLY think Sniper should be placed in a open world (if they can make that work of course). I say this because there were these moments where I saw a base, and I wanted to explore it quite a bit, but could not. In these cases, these were the sniper only moments. I'll be honest, awesome distance shots, but limits your exploration obviously. However I would argue open world would allow the player to decide how they wanted to handle these locations. Now that CI has gotten long range down, I can only imagine the opportunity it would give! Also, if you slip up, the enemy can actually send units to your location, instead of believing a guy with an AK spotted you and not only shoots at you, but nails you with deadly accuracy, from a distance that will surely make you scratch your head. 

That being said, I enjoyed the maps quite a bit. I am not the biggest dessert fan (finding it kind of bland, tbh). However, there is a mission where you have trees and a lot of cover. I found this mission the most nerve raking (in a good way), paranoid of the enemy sniper that could be lurking in the bush, tree, cliff. I would have liked more like this, but I understand. 

Also, as a side note, please CI work on the enemy communication skills a bit. I am not a big fan of, ""I saw you! I will now use my hive mind power so we ALL see you!"" design. I understand it kind of makes the game easy to allow us a moment to react and stop an enemy from calling it in and bringing down the base on our heads. But it is more believable, then a split second is all it took to inform everyone of my exact location all at once. 

At the end of the day, 30 hours in, and I beat it! I think it is a really fun shooter / sniper. I am now excited for the next installment! 

Appreciate the hard work CI! And if you get the game, I hope you enjoy!",1622954022,1623213032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You get enough help at the second highest, and then you can go for the top difficulty for a second play-through after.

This is supposed to be a sneaky beaky game, sadly i'd say not only the base game is needed, having the DLC that gives the option of the better silenced pistol and the silenced shotgun as secondary makes it more enjoyable (then again only if you play veteran +) makes the veteran a bit easier, but way more fun. Then you can deal with most situations and it just... feels nice.

Sure Sniper Elite 3 and 4 does better with the slowmo things, but we got pretty nice violence and grotesque scenes happening.

First run you'll for sure have to load in a couple times and you won't get the ""no load"" bonus unless you are god gamer.
But that just gives slight incentive to go for a quick second play through. 

But yeah, Recommended at a discount for sure., This is a great game for people that like sniping and stealth at $20-$30.

people say its too short, in which i disagree. I feel the length of the game is fair considering the pricing of the game. The game is also fairly replayeble, i have replayed a few missons after finishing and i could see myself coming back and playing each level atleast 1 more time.

pros: 
the long range missions are great and alot of fun, you also have alot of freedom to choose whatever aproach you like in both mission types. Very smooth and satisfying game, that can be slow or fast pased depending on what you like. 

cons: my biggest gripe with the game is how blind the AI is, no matter the difficulty. The game should be more difficult or atleast give you more options witch tuning the suport you get when sniping.

I'll be comparing this game to the previous one quite a lot since to me a sequel should improve what was already there.

In terms of content I think this game is on par with the previous game.

There's 5 contracts in total, 2 ""classic"" contracts, which are your basic contracts from the previous game, and 3 Long shot contracts.
 Long shot contracts are linear paths with enemies sprinkled on for you to clear or avoid while you move from observation point (OP) to observation point. 
On these OPs you will have visual on your actual objectives which will be anywhere from 800 to 1500 meters away. I'd describe these OP segments as long range sniping puzzles, which the difficulty of varies based on what you're trying to achieve. 
Just trying to kill the HVT and move on? 1 or 2 shots and you're done and moving onto the next OP. Trying to beat the challenge to take them out stealthily? You'll have to think and possibly reload for this one, as you gotta lure this guy away to take out this guy to take out the fuse box to get eyes on this guy, and so on.

This can be quite enjoyable for your average completionist and a breeze for those just wanting to move on.
The 2 classic contracts are exactly what you'd expect. Move around the map and take out objectives A, B, C ,D, and E in varied locations for better or worse. One huge problem in my opinion is the amount of invincible drone jammers on the maps completely destroying the potential of doing recon with the drone in a lot of places.

I do enjoy the classic contracts almost as much as the contracts from the previous game although I feel like they lack enough variety due to there only being two.

And even though I enjoy the long shot contracts I don't like that they came at the cost of 3 classic ones.
Had there been more classic contracts along with the long shot contracts I could easily recommend you to  buy the game at full price.
As it stands the game will likely take on average 6 to 8 hours to complete on deadeye, with maybe about 15 hours of content for completionists.

Would recommend you buy on sale unless you loved the previous games and want to support the devs.

side note: the assault rifle sights look better than last time so that's pretty good.

[h1] However, the core gameplay is still pretty much the same. If you like C1, you will like C2 a lot. If you don’t like C1, well there is a high chance you won’t like C2 either. [/h1]

2 years after SGW3, CI Games came back with SGW Contracts. Another 2 years, they give us Contracts 2.  It’s a much more polished game this time around. 

[b] The improvements: [/b]
-Extreme long range sniping, their trademark selling point in this game. Now along with normal, classic low-medium range maps, the game will have extreme long range map which targets will usually be 1000m+ away. You can only see the enemies through your scope or binocular. These areas are especially made for long range sniping that you can’t not get in there no matter what you do. And of course, sniping at those long distance is very satisfying. If you want to make it even more challenging, use rifles with low magnification scope. 
-Much better blood and gore. If you watched some of the trailers, you already knew that head exploding is a thing and it looks awesome. Compared to Contracts 1 which the blood effect looks like toy, splatter into little dots, C2 improves it and now it looks more natural. Bullet-cams are also improved, more camera angles and variety. For people who don’t like gore and bullet-cams, you can turn those off completely as well.
-Better choices for both casual and veteran players alike. CI Games brings back the red dot aim assist (which was removed in Contracts 1) so casual players won’t have to deal with all the sniping mechanics and go straight to head-poppin’ business. For players who think that Contracts 1 is quite easy on the hardest difficulty (myself included), CI Games introduces a new 4th difficulty called Deadeye (also named Deadeye in C1 as the highest difficulty, now the 3rd difficulty in C2 is Veteran Sniper which is the same as Deadeye in C1). In Deadeye in C2, they remove the distance indicator on the tag above enemies head and the white curvy vertical line indicating wind in your scope (the white horizontal lines indicating the distance of your bullet drop are still visible). So now you will have to use your binocular to know your target’s distance everytime you take a shot or you will have to remember them. The removal of the white curvy line makes sniping much harder, especially at long range. Last but not least, the AI. In lower difficulty when you graze a shot, enemies won’t be alerted directly and they will go into suspicious state for awhile (stop doing what they are doing and start looking around, alarm still not triggered). In Deadeye a single stray bullet will alert the enemy and they will try to take cover immediately, alarm will be triggered shortly after (which make sense irl because you will know immediately if a bullet just grazed you). Also AI have deadly accuracy. Even at those extremely long range distances (1000m+) I still get shot at by riflemen (but they deal lower damage. At close range you will die in just 1-2 shots). Hit by enemy snipers on this difficulty will almost be lethal, sometimes lethal. I highly don’t recommend going loud on Deadeye. It is more challenging, but also much more fun than Contracts 1. 
-The game now have a little bit of contingency. Enemy groups may spawn somewhat different each time (not much different, but it can affect how they interact with the environment (for example there are 2 guys and they usually spawn standing around a table discussing something. I usually shoot at a control panel box nearby so one of them will go investigate it and I can take them out one by one. However sometimes they spawn not around the table and when I shoot the panel BOTH of them will go investigate)). This add more to the replayability unlike in C1 enemies spawn all scripted).
-Better graphics and optimization. Although the game doesn’t look MUCH better than Contracts 1, I still think the difference are noticeable (lightning, texture, blood effects are the one I noticed). More importantly, the game runs better. On my same specs (16gb RAM, i7 7700, rtx 2060), I got 70fps average and just about 60fps lowest in Contracts 1. Meanwhile in Contracts 2, my average fps is ~90 and the lowest is about 70 (I already played through 2 maps). The stuttering when auto-save is still there but it is less heavy. 
-Auto save now will save more often. Yes some players don’t like auto-save (which might want this to be in the negatives section), but I have no problem with auto save in Contracts 1 and now in C2 it saves much more often and it will allow you to choose the save you want to load, not just the last save, so all good for me. 
-Middle East setting. I think this appeals to many people. 
-Secondary weapons now can be equipped with suppressor (not all of them). Players complained when Contracts 1 didn’t allow suppressor on secondaries. Also they brings back more variety such as smg and compound bow. 
-Weapons (especially pistol) have a more heavy, meaty recoil feel. They even added a headshot hitmarker sound effect. Really satisfying.
[b] The negatives: [/b]
-I’m having a very annoying (not game breaking bug) that the voice of my character is extremely, extremely low. I have to turn my audio sound and my window sound to max to even know that his voice is there (at first I thought his voice was completely gone) but if I do that my ears will gone deaf. Also no voice of enemy in interrogation. 
-As of right now some challenges are very buggy and you can fail them randomly even when you haven't done anything violated to them.
-The hybrid sight attachment is quite useless. It is very obstructive and I would rather use my normal scope on the lowest zoom. Only equip it just because it looks cool. 
-Some random crashes. I think I have crashed 2-3times. 
-I’ve heard that the performance on Console is very poor. 

[h1] So yea, I really like the game and I definitely recommend it. I’m a sucker for this franchise (despite some of the previous games are not so good) but Contracts 2 is blowing me away. [/h1]",1622881253,1623177640,True,32,1,0.713058829307556152,0,True,False,False

All levels are open and you can tackle the objectives however you want, but there's a clear flow to the design guiding you between the objectives. All enemy sections are spacious, with varying elevations and buildings, giving you lots of choices of sniping positions. The highlight of the game for me is the long range contracts. In these missions the objectives are really far away from your position (1km +), you set foot there. Your targets will often stand in difficult positions, so you have to be methodical and smart to succeed. With the well designed gun feeling and sound, you just feel so bad ass when you hit your target and walk away without alarming the enemy. There are also classic levels where you have to infiltrate enemy base, those missions are cool to but not as fun as the long range one imo. 

I played the game at normal difficulty cause I'm bad at fps games, and I felt good playing it. The game is accessible if you're interested but rarely play fps. I did however feel overpowered during the later missions after upgrading my stuff, so you might want to raise the difficulty. 

I really like the tools, but ended up mainly using the drone. Same with the different ammo types, I just used 2 types Maybe playing  in higher difficulty will force me to utilize everything. 

As for the negative stuff, I think the AI is pretty dumb, but this might be related to difficulty setting. Movement is a little stupid too. For some reason crouching I can't walk over stick 5cm high. I have to stand up, which exposes me to danger. Also I have to stand up to interact with ladders, and I always stand up at the end up climbing/descending. I occasionally get stuck between rocks or trees. I hope the debs will fix it soon. 

The game has a political message, but it's pretty toothless. If you're uncomfortable with politics in games don't worry about it. 

Overall, really great game. I had a blast and totally recommend this.

One was after I got killed and resuscitated by the game some of the soldiers would be frozen in place for a time unless you immediately triggered the alarm, which woke them up. Soldiers being alive under water if knocked in when killed and you require resuscitating again after killing them before the level is finished. Some of the enemy snipers would be doing a shake on the spot when viewed through the binoculars. The other, which I am sure many others will mention, shot a soldier at 1100 m using a silenced light rifle and immediately everybody knew exactly where I was and proceeded to try and shoot a prone target with automatic rifles. Okay the spotters with bino's might have been looking in my direction and got a glint of a reflection as I shot, or a tiny puff of smoke if there was any at all, using a .50 cal with no silencer they might have heard the shot but would have no idea of direction

Am I being picky when they said long range shots and the average was around 1100 m, I think the longest I got was 1300+ but had to shuffle around to get that one, I am sure somebody found longer ones and I probably will now I know where the targets are likely to be and can find a different shooting angle.

The drone as somebody mentioned already is virtually a none starter, the few times i thought it would be handy there were drone jammer's, maybe a few more runs and I might find a use for it. 

I just felt there should be more to the game. I understand the long range targets being a challenge, but it was either or, not do it long range or sneak in and knife him if you feel up to it. The long range were just that long range, no alternative if you wanted too. 

Bottom line, I enjoyed the game but was left feeling that there should have been more, something I did not get from previous games in the series.",1623153583,1623153583,True,5,0,0.530339539051055908,0,True,False,False

Its not without faults though. My biggest concern after (briefly) playing the first one, was of check point saves in an open world game. The two just don't mix. And shouldn't mix. This game does address those concerns somewhat. Mainly by saving very frequently. There were only a couple of occasions that I grumbled about having to replay a chunk because I hadn't been able to save/force a checkpoint save. But fortunately, few and far.
I will still say that its 2021, people have responsibilities and being able to save and walk away from the computer at ANY given time should be an option. However, it is what it is, and they have done much better in this game. 

Graphics are great. Kill cams are a little slow, and you can't skip them when they trigger. I do miss the x-ray kill cams from the Sniper Elite. It would be nice to see where you hit people as its not always clear. But they are still suitably gory. The weapons are chunky and feel great to use. Especially satisfying to fire the .50cals. Story is ok. Blah blah kill bad guy blah blah. It's a means to an end. Sound is equally fine. Background music was background. The sound effects were good.

Sadly, I did think that the long range shooting was a little, well, not as good I hoped. With the right scope, shooting a stationary target (which most are) at 1500m is no more difficult then shooting a target at 200 or 300 meters. You need more lead when shooting the moving targets, but that's about it. Considering its a selling point, I just found it a little underwhelming. 

But those concerns aside, I did enjoy it and I do recommend it.",1623152341,1623152341,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My advice, wait for the first patch, cos it's going to be a big one.

Here's why:

The game is basically the same; lots of gadgets, big pretty levels, interesting puzzles, and so on. This one takes the cheap option of ""noble heroes protecting the world"" rather than ""secretive mercenaries with mysterious nefarious motives"" - I liked the previous narrative more. I can be a noble defender of democracy in enough other games. But that doesn't detract much from the game itself.

The levels are big and have various ways to achieve objectives, though they're all heavily scripted so it's often as much about figuring out the script and its triggers, than actually reconnoitering the objective. Still, it's fun and you'll get a lot of gameplay out of it if that's your thing.

The enemies' overhead commentary is cute as always, including one prescient victim who comments that he feels like a shallow character in a video game. But it gets lame and old pretty fast, when someone has come past reciting the same one-liner several times because that's his one and only line. City: just put in a flag. If the player has heard the comment, don't play it again. Say something else. Say nothing. Either is better than hearing the same remark about getting a dog 20 times over, and way better than hearing it from different guards. At that point it transitions from 'cute' to 'lazy' to 'lame' pretty quickly, which means I'm halfway through the game and the guards are lame.

That's indicative, though. This game was rushed out like a bullet train behind schedule. There are bugs and glitches EVERYWHERE, and the interface is absolutely littered with really dumb spelling mistakes (seriously?!) that proclaim just how many corners were cut in QC (ie: all of them). Some of the levels are an exercise in frustration while you tiptoe around badly coded triggers (eg: you can kill off a whole level's worth of enemies without triggering the pivotal baddie so long as you don't actually tag them).

For a game with such huge levels, the actual level boundaries are ridiculously arbitrary sometimes, probably because of bad testing rather than bad design. The first real level has a small enclosed cove with a jetty. You can swim TO the jetty (and its guard), but you can't swim around to get behind the guard, because although there's the cliff wall that surrounds it, its all out of bounds. During the oilfields level you can clamber all over mountains, but there's a similar part the map boundary is inexplicably inside the mission area, so you take a step towards an already-close wall and are suddenly getting the out of bounds alert.

The long-range missions where you can't actually approach the objective and take a hands-on approach feel more like SGW2, rather than SGW:C2. Very linear, very scripted, and VERY arbitrary - new enemies will spawn from thin air simply because it's required by the narrative, rather than actually arriving in a truck or getting out of bed or something. You can't plan for some of that, because it happens TO you, not WITH you, and certainly not in response to your engagement with the environment. Again, it feels rushed or lazy or both.

So, yeah: If you liked SGW:C, you'll probably like SGW:C2. It's basically the same game only bigger, and with bigger bugs. If you can be patient, and a good sniper should be patient, you'll wait for a significant patch to land first though. At least fix the spelling mistakes, City.

I was expecting there to be another region, but no you only get one. It's about 4 long missions and 1 short final mission. There were some bugs, such as when you slide down almost any decline your character gets temporarily stuck. Occasionally the map would get stuck and could only be fixed by a restart. The most irritating bug I've experienced is not having challenges completed despite having met the requirements. 

Graphics are average for a game in 2021, I enjoyed watching people's brains explode but it's nothing mind blowing. The music was decent, it fit the general theme of the game.

There is brilliance here, great fun and there is an odd  idiocy so boring and compromised by bad reticles and basic misunderstanding on the ""ones"" of snipping that it makes the game truly unplayable. When it shines, those parts are not to be missed as they are beautifully rendered and as engaging as one would ever want, a new HIGH for the franchise. But, just as I had feared looking at the little we were shown, when it fails it is awful, unplayable and it stops you wanting to return to the game and as there is no going past one chapter until it is done, we will all have to stay put....on a platform....and pretend that this is fun. It is a bore folks, the scopes are simplistic, the marking unreadable (as are many of the distances on heads (read on green? ok....)  and it is an awful ugly grind. As many have noted....

SPOLER ALERT - ITS SPOILED

CHAPTER ONE.....arrived shot the target....nothing else in that whole complex world to do. Seriously, ZERO...NADA.....what a joke. shots fired? One. Crawled through the earlier village. Shots fires - none. Got to the first PLATFORM(?) found the target and shot once, left. over. Thousands of yards between me and the game and a huge group of buildings and warehouses, a half dozen electrical fuse panels, 50 guys...ALL FOR NOTHING.....THAT FOLKS IS THE PLATFORM EXPERIENCE....One HUGE bore. FIND THE PERSON(S) THAT THOUGHT THAT THE SERIES NEEDED 2000 YARDS SHOTS FROM A PLATFORM WITH FLAGS AND HAND THEM A BROOM. I PROMISE YOU ALL THIS.....THIS WILL BE THE LAST SGW ENTRY WITH PLATFORMS AND ENDLESS EMPTY WASTELANDS WERE WE ARE SEPARATED FROM LITERALLY EVERYTHING THAT MAKES THE SERIES AN EXERCISE IN STEALTH FOR ME. INTERACTION IS THE ACTION, STATIC SHOTS ARE A BORE. 

Chapter 2 - FANTASTIC IN ALL REGARDS, simply brilliant. I enjoyed the vast majority of it. Well done. Fix all the snipers in the sniper school walking into the doorway of the tunnel. Send them elsewhere, you will find them in a stack like fire wood including the special contract that was exactly like all the others. Aside from that, great. 

Chapter 3 - TERRIBLE, A wasteland, The Slog Of The Bad Reticle and PLatform Nonsense continues. The LONG RANGE isn't the problem, never was, This isn't anything like actually having to shoot at long range. The real issue here is the LIMITATIONS OF PROGRAMMING and the SCOPES and the RETICLES are the problem.

- IF YOU SHOOT FROM A PLATFORM YOU WILL BE FOUND
- IF YOU CANT REALLY MOVE FROM THE PLATFORM, YOU WILL BE FOUND
- In CONTRACTS 1, we all had great fun finding a place that our silhouettes went dark and the game allowed us to be hidden NON OF THAT HERE, ZERO. I would literally pull the trigger and before the impact would move behind a box and sure enough I was immediately found. THE MOST CHALLENGING ends up boring challenging because the toxic mix of bad reticles.  PLAINLY PUT - There is exactly ZERO STEALTH in the long range CHAPTERS. They fail at every level. BORING, or worse, the  the randomness of what has to be the crappiest scope reticles that one can hardly read makes it a painful unnecessary slog. 

When there is movement, thoughtful planning and decisions to be made. Then my friends it shines. The scenes that are not endless dull desert wastelands are gorgeously rendered and the building are complex. AND...for the very first time in any sniper game the response if you screw up is over whelming. Lots and Lots of soldiers....just like a central huge station would have. So interesting and engaging, so compelling to plan ahead and get it right, 

I spent hundreds of hours on CONTRACTS 1, I doubt I'll finish CONTRACTS 2. Platforms and static shots are just not what does it.

Gun play is fun, missions are sufficiently challenging without being overly difficult.  Graphics are nice.  The maps are complex, imaginative and very well designed and they were a lot of fun to explore. 
One huge improvement over the last version is that the game saves way more frequently so that if you get killed, you don't have to start so far back; having to do that in C1 was rage inducing.  
I love the gore effects.  They’re very realistic.  I’m a former Marine and long time police officer so I’ve seen a lot of this stuff up close and personal and C2 does it better than any game that I am aware of.  The only part that doesn’t look real is the blood on the ground after a kill; it’s too watery and not thick enough. 
I only have one big complaint and that the game is way too short.  For the amount of money I spent, I would expect much longer game play.  It’s really disappointing when you’re enjoying a game so much and it disappointingly comes to an end sooner than you’d like.
I recommend this game, but with a little reluctance, because of the limited amount of game play you get for the cost.  Other than that shortcoming, it’s a great game if you like a slower moving, more tactical (somewhat HITMAN-esque) type sniping game.

In SGWC2 that is the norm. I see that they've learned a couple things from the first game and simplified and bundled in some mechanics. I came across SGWC(1) by accident through a bundle and loved it and SGWC2 is that but amplified. I beat the game in one sitting.

The other reviewers are right in the 1km AI. I don't understand how you can detect enemy fire from 1.4km away and pinpoint their exact location in about 5 seconds or less. After beating the game and restarting the first mission over it made a lot more sense. As entertaining as it would be to watch a bunch of morons panic in circles for the next 30 minutes as you murderify them with a smile, SGWC1 and 2 are actually puzzle games with a sniper theme to it. My first go at the first region was just shooting gallery bonanza (which I enjoyed) but the 2nd go around I actually looked at all the helpful environmental stuff to reposition enemies, change sight-lines, reveal opportunities, and slowly whittle away at their life force. It wasn't until the Prison Escape sniper mission where I realized it was a puzzle game.  Of course, play it how you want. After doing the first mission the 2nd time, I did it again by just shooting the main target in the back of the head and skidadding out of Dodge before the bullet even hit the target.

As far as performance goes, it ran fine. I have a Ryzen 5800x, 32GB DDR4-3200, RTX 3070, and all solid storage. I played on a 4K 144Hz monitor but could only muster around 40-60fps at max-max-max graphics. Luckily the targets are moving a few pixels across the screen at a time, unless you hip-fired the rifles through entire objectives like I occasionally do.

The game isn't without bugs. One particularly annoying one is the sniper auto-reloading randomly. The starting rifle had a tendency to do this for me. One bullet in the magazine so I reload to 5. I shoot one bullet and the game forces another reload. Kinda interrupts the flow of committing localized genocide on a small desert town a klick out but it's whatever. Besides that, CryEngine FPS movement has never been the greatest. AI are both absolutely idiotic and machines of detection at the same time. I've had the beret wearing guys look directly at me as I'm about 10 feet away next to a road sign, then proceed to bugger off like they weren't paid enough to notice. Meanwhile, a standard grunt saw my ear through a bullet hole at 1km.

One thing I wish were in the game was ballistic drag. Having been the range myself years ago with a 308, wind has more effect on the bullet than just turning it to the left or right. With more wind, the bullet actually slows down a lot more with gravity taking care of the rest. Though, if SGWC implemented this, the game would be basically unplayable. Same with other long range effects like miraging and heat shimmering, shifting the sight picture. I hope they put in a DLC for a new difficulty just called Simulation or something. That'd be crazy.

If you know me, you know it hurts my soul to buy games at full-price. Yes, this one hurt but I gotta it was well worth it. Going to the sniper ranges costs about a dollar per bullet IRL and I probably shot like two hundred dudes in this game.

I could've quite happily kept playing SGW Contracts and got as much enjoyment from that as I did from SGW Contracts 2.

The good stuff:

- Recommended as a fun game but honestly only if you haven't played the first SGW Contracts.  IMO there aren't enough overall differences to make this significantly better than the first one.
- Long distance contracts are cool.  Hard to say for ""normal"" people how realistic the sniper mechanics are, but bullet drop and wind impact seems well done.
- One enjoyable thing about the long distance contracts was that [spoiler]you don't always take down your targets by shooting them directly[/spoiler].  That was cool.
- Environments are great.  Lots of stuff to hide behind if you're into sniping from cover like me (yeah, I'm a wuss).
- Sound is excellent.  For me some games are made and broken by their soundtracks, both music and effects.
- I like that the publisher/creator doesn't charge through the roof for this game.  When some games are $100+ it is nice that this one is only just half that (here in Aus, anyway).
- Not overly important maybe but the game loads and is playable quickly.  I appreciate that.
- I also appreciate the tiny 13GB size ... lol.

The not so good stuff:

- I wanted to work as Seeker and Handler again.  I thought the partnership between [spoiler]Raven and Control[/spoiler] (character names so not *really* a spoiler) was weirdly ""friendly"" vs the first game that seemed more business-like.  Given the story line, the business-like relationship seemed more appropriate.
- Long distance hits aren't particularly difficult.  I don't play on the extreme difficulty levels but ... yeah.
- Had a couple of mid-game crashes.  Both times the message was ""Pure function call"" and an OK button, nothing else.

1. The lack of content, the main story is short. It was completed in ~10 hours. The way the game extends this is by completing challenges and having your run the same missions in a different fashion.
2. The AI in standard missions is laughable, use of decoy rocks or throwing knives will take any challenge out of these missions. All AI paths are on rails until disturbed making avoiding them even easier. 

While the Cold Bore missions feel slightly more flushed out the the challenge never goes beyond the tutorial and trying to hit a the moving targets. It becomes a puzzle game at the end of a rifle. While that can be fun there is just not enough.

Take that for what you will, but keep that in mind.

Right off the bat, if you spend any time looking at the store page, you'll notice the abundance of DLC available immediately at launch. At first when I bought the game I received this DLC for free with my purchase, I thought it some preorder / day 1 package like games sometimes do, and was more okay with it seeing it in that light, even though day 1 DLC generally feels extremely gross to me, especially for gameplay changing content, which these guns definitely are as they are generally much better than the weapons included in the base game. I played the game for a few hours, and eventually left it with pretty positive impressions overall. Not a perfect game, nor a particularly groundbreaking or well made one, but a fun one at least. 

Then I got back on today to play it again, and found my weapons were not what they were when I hit that checkpoint previously. My DLC had been revoked, and my weapons were reverted to the default weapons (which made no sense for the mission I was doing) and all the in-game money I spent on upgrades for what I now realized were DLC weapons was gone. Looking at my now limited arsenal to pick from I was overcome with a sense of betrayal and disappointment that my time was not respected and I would have to pay them more money for the actually fun day 1 DLC weapons I already had before. This alone left a bitter taste in my mouth and tarnishes my opinion of the game generally.

Even if that didn't happen, I probably would still struggle to recommend this game to other people. The game prides itself on its ""hyper-realistic sniper experience"" but this is definitely not so, even on the hardest difficulty (which is all I played on). 
The AI are hilariously deaf to gunfire from unsuppressed weapons <50 meters away (A literal 50 cal). To the game's credit, suppressed weapons don't seem completely silent, as the AI can hear them if you're close, I wouldn't call it realistic yet but closer than most games are. 
The weapon behavior is unrealistic, changing ammo types is just a magazine swap, even though the bullet in the chamber would actually still be the old ammo. 
Bullet drop and windage adjustment are exaggerated (At least it's not as bad as sniper elite in this way). 
You have magic enemy tags that track people through walls.
Throwing knives are present and ruin any sense of realism on their own. 
The graphics are aliased when still until the motion blur you can't turn off smears them away until you stop moving the camera again. 
There's like 5 or so missions that take place in pseudo-open-world areas. I say pseudo because the maps are like tiny open areas stitched together by linear hallways and tunnels, probably for making the streaming in and out of these areas easier I'd imagine. Either way, not truly open in the sense like MGS5 was. 
You constantly get stuck on terrain and foliage when trying to do anything but walk on open roads (in a [i]stealth[/i] game)
The soundtrack is surprisingly good
The UI is not impressive
I could go on but that's about everything you need to know.

TL;DR 
-Scummy day 1 DLC
-Okay gameplay but budget shows

This game is fun in a lot of areas from the sniping mechanics, to the stealth, buying new weapons and gear, exploring, etc. But the game also has it's bads from some wacky game design choices, AI programming and some other things I will list. 
The game is BEAUTIFUL first of all. It gives you some really good graphics and a pretty good view of all the details in the terrain and weapons. The maps are decently spaced, though that whole '1400' killshot thing they say, I feel is a bit confusing. Do not get me wrong, you do pull some 1000m shots, but it isn't like you have the choice of going over and killing the target close range or not, you HAVE to set up in specific sniper hides just to take those shots. So it isn't like you are figuring it out for yourself, it is more like it is taking you on a ride and giving the 'Shoot from here' treatment. Now the weapons are pretty good. They sound punchy and feel pretty powerful, except a few shots I have had where it feels like it should have killed the enemy, but just gave me a hitmarker. I digress though. The characters are honestly nothing to write home about, neither is the story. It gets the job done, but isn't anything special. Gadgets and such are, again, pretty samey and simple. Not bad, just nothing special. There is a little drone that flies that you can use for recon or poisoning enemies or a turret that can be used for sync shots, but I never used them tbh. 
Now for the bad things...The AI can be as blind as a damn bat sometimes. You can be running up to one and as long as you duck into tall grass or foliage, they literally lose sight of you quick. Of course, this can be tweaked by going into a harder difficulty, but it is funny because you can actually stay in high grass and no one can see you unless you bump into them. Enemy variety is pretty eh, since it is just things like snipers, riflemen, heavy gunners and officers which are pretty much just soldiers. There are bounties, but are kind of just riflemen. There is one huge glaring issue I do not like. When an enemy finds a body or even hears a shot, they know exactly where you are. Of course, they would go into high alert if they heard a shot or saw a body, but it is like they know EXACTLY where you are in both regards. Everything else about the game is kind of middle of the road, not very heavy hitting or anything to write home about. I am not recommending this game because 1. There is no 'it's eh' button and 2. Because while the bad things seem small, it can happen in every level of the game. I will not say stay away from this game, but I will say to be cautious. It is a good game with some wacky design choices.",1623036408,1623036408,False,2,0,0.522939920425415039,0,True,False,False

- The AI works strange. It is really confusing. I once reloaded the save , cleared half of the camp and noticed that I hadn't killed a sniper. Guy had clear vision of all bodies dropping and didn't even bother. I can't say I came across problems of other people who claim that AI can find and shoot them over 1000m away. In my case they just shot at the general direction of my position , not knowing my exact location.
- I am glad that bullet cam double kills are working more consistently. In first game I often got caught in situations where almost exact shot with bullet cam killed only one enemy when without got both.
- I really miss the wind indicator that was present in SGW3. It was so much more challenging to land the shot , required a lot more calculations and adjustments. I understand that it might be a little to hard for SGW:C and SGW:C2 standards , but I'd really REALLY would love to see a DLC contracts or some extreme shooting scenarios where we have to adjust to the wind ourselves ( or even more than wind , making it even more challenging), and take out only a handful of targets to make this mode somehow playable. (for example , elimination of Zarza in the first area would be perfect for such a scenario)

I can see the game provides a piece of cake for everyone, making both extreme long range shooting and classic SGW:C contracts , I will update when I finish those

Hey trentscousin, we temporarily give you access to various of these gadgets to teach you the basics of the controls and the game as part of the tutorial. You can buy the majority of them after the completion of your first region. we're sorry to hear this isn't want you were expecting, but despite this we still hope you enjoyed the game. Feedback is really important to us and if you have any thoughts on how to improve our tutorial or the franchise in general, please share them with us by e-mailing support@cigames.com

My point is this.

If you are starting out in the game (any game) and are new at it, you would everywhere and always benefit from boosts of any type.

To suggest that as you gain experience and thusly need less help, we will (then) give you access to these boosts, is non-sequitur at best and disingenuous at worst.

The correct response should have been, this is how ""rpg's"" work, you gain ""xp"" you get ""perks"" would that make sense in ""real life""? 

Not even a little, so I do not fault you for choosing this path for a ""game"".

I just wanted to have the realism such that my handlers would send me out with the ""best"" gear and not say.........""Well TC, you do great on the next 3 misssions and we will get you a bullet proof vest AND night goggles!.

Now ""get out there and perform!"".

Also, your statement (from above) "" we temporarily give you access to various of these gadgets to teach you the basics of the controls and the game as part of the tutorial. You can buy the majority of them after the completion of your first region""  

IF (if) I read that right, (although you only give me ""suppressed"" pistol (not rifle), that the items I used in the Tutorial are whisked away from me at the end, so that I can gain the pleasure of (purchasing them via skill unlocks/game currencly) at a later date.

IS that true? If so, my statement becomes (if possible), even more faultless.

I thank you for your response and I would like for you to consider my position.

Kind Regards,

Trentscousin (TC).",1622934761,1623015486,False,0,4,0.277337938547134399,0,True,False,False

As a sniping game it has its moments of fun as you pick through a level and try to solve the ""puzzle"" of who to take out first and how. The problem is the game hasn't made many changes since its first iteration.

The AI is perhaps slightly better but not enough so that they are fun. The AI is probably the most frustrating part of the game as there is zero consistency even if you're reloading a save file. They randomly know where are, sometimes they freak out for no reason, other times they just start double back and moving in such a jarring fashion its impossible to hit.

If you do hit a shot, occasionally AI just decide not to die or take damage and instead freak out and everyone knows exactly where you are. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if there was save function outside of autosave. However, they've locked you into an Autosave feature that is so bad you'll either have to go back several kills each time or load right back to the moment you alert everyone.

The challenges at first seem fun but quickly grow tedious as you're forced to spam LOAD SAVE and try to get around janky AI and sometimes incredibly poorly built levels. For instance, there is an underground level with catwalks and the AI even if they aren't looking at you will start to detect if you're at a weird angle above them. It's beyond brain dead in a tragic way and mars what is otherwise a fun game genre.

I dont want to talk about graphics, since CryEngine always did a good job (and CI Games' artists too!).

This is the full review (completed the game, main story, and some challenges, not a perfectionist-type)

PROS:
1. Better than predecessor in terms of mission, AI, and sniper mechanics.
2. Two-type of missions: Classic and Long Shot. The Long Shot one was very good, this was the first time in Sniper Ghost Warrior franchise mission ever have if I'm not wrong to remember it.
3. They remove a lot of bugs in the predecessor. Especially the AI bug and unnecessary things.
4. Super good sniper mechanics and handle. You can choose the light, medium, and heavy sniper rifle. You cannot use silencer in heavy sniper and will be so loud, be careful with that. Sorry I can't explain how good since I'm not really good with it.

CONS:
1. AI somewhat still feels stupid and buggy in some cases, a lot of restart from save point makes them as always, act randomly, even if the corpses are gone. But this only happens few times, not frequently like the predecessor did.
2. Auto-turret bug when I was gone still detecting me until I go to the upper floor.
3. Another bug I have encountered are the spotlight sometimes still detect me even I have destroyed it.
4. Some AI suddenly spawn behind me, while I always make sure they're dead. Yeah, while its better but some of it are still problematic.
5. Need to stop the basic tutorial only and give some further important tutorial tips while playing the game. This will help the newbies to grasp the game.

Some improvements needs to be done and please, do it on your next game CI Games. Contracts 3 or whatever:
1. Delete the done task > exfil > done task > exfil. This was super annoying because the exfil somehow too far from the mission. Do like Hitman did, you complete all missions in one region, then exfil.
2. Sadly you cannot use silencer at the first mission. Devs should give starter pack for players to choose between: silent, infiltrator, marksman, brawler, etc. My gameplay style was silent long range, it was very problematic when I got my first rifle without silencer and forced me to use silenced handgun. It would not hurts to give some options right?
3. The auto-detect session and send army to kill player after kill the target in long shot missions was absurd! I'm using silenced weapon, logically speaking you will never knew I was there at the first place. Fix it if you want to use another long shot missions. This feature is very not good.
4. Give player some traversal options like rope to climb high places or going down safely. I really mad when the enemy AI can go to places I can't go, they can have a lot of easy spot while players cant.
5. Stop using features like ""only these places are climb-able, while the others cant"". Even if it looks like its climb-able. Give player more freedom to climb anything that logically speaking can be climbed. That way players can show their creativity.

===

You can play this as standalone game without playing the prequel, because the main character is different. Also it has been improved a lot. The predecessor was worse in terms of AI and some gameplay. Makes every restart randomly annoying. This game, even if it still has some problem like the predecessor, it also has been improved and not frequently happening by a lot. Just a little bit.

long range sniping 
new weapon
now you can put suppressor on assault rilfe
more 'sniper' than the first one

Cons:
somehow i can't use bipod (bug?)
some weapon animation feels clunky 
suppressor restriction

animation
gunsmith
more unique gameplay 
manual cycle option on bolt action sniper rifle (can be set manual or auto, because i love watching the spinning shell ejected from the gun)

Disappointing that it is impossible to 'approach' the target in some missions as the lazy level design either has cliffs of death or invisible walls preventing the player from getting closer then the 800m or so they are supposed to be sniping from (this is not a sandbox shooter as it is advertised).

despite the criticism, it was fun to play through the story, and as someone not interested in getting a perfect kill, it was still replay-able. Fun for some, but leave your brain at the door.

The easiest mode is almost impossible to fail, while the hardest is neither fun or realistic.

The story doesn't grip me, but thankfully, you can skip the loading cutscenes. The price is fair, but I'd strongly recommend treading lightly. I'm about 50/50 on agreeing that the price is absolutely worth it. On the bright side the maps are nice and distant, but I'd like to be able to drive or visit the locations that are beyond the map limits, I know this isn't that kind of game, but I dunno, I miss the open world driving in ghost warrior 3. The enemies may able to drive, but it's not THAT big of a problem, you barely have any road to traverse anyway, despite the sizes of the maps, it's still mostly trails. What gets on my nerves are the seemingly bullet sponge enemies, especially at +1000 meters. Now I don't know what cartridges these rifles fire but I'm at least familiar with the Defender 888 in real life, because I own one. It resembles the Ruger Precision Rifle quite impressively I might add, except for the trigger being a bit too concave, but that's whatever, that feature is the least of my problem. Believe it or not, my rifle cost me just below $1400, but the one in game is dummy expensive, but I get why it would be, it's one hell of a fine rifle. I felt as if I was ripping off my gun store as I walked out the door with it. The Defender along with the majority of the other rifles are wildly under powered, at times I'm having to hit someone several times at around +-1000m and if you don't drop the enemy within a couple of seconds after getting a hit marker, they and the entire compound are immediately alerted and aware of your location. It's frustrating being forced to head shot an enemy at a numerically obtuse distance when changing the range is only possible at intervals of 100m. and this is even worse when playing on deadeye, because they have a mild case of aimbot and they can drop you in seconds at any distance, so I no longer bother on playing on the highest difficulty, admittedly I haven't been able to find a reason as to why I should, seeing is that there's little to no incentive to do so. Now about the scopes. Was it ever considered to introduce new variants in this new release? Because not only are they all the same, but the only difference is the magnification between each scope. Obviously, the higher the price of the scope, the better the range. After a while, I had enough of the 100 interval, despite these tools being state of the art, I had to catch my composure when missing targets of say 1080m or 1176m when I knew for a FACT I had them dead on target. And with the enemies being bullet sponges, you're forced to aim for their heads at variable distances. Missing by an inch is provoking, being forced to aim center mass and getting 3, 4, or 5 hit markers while they take off in a sprint alerting the entire compound is blood boiling. 

A heavy or what looks to be a 50 caliber or .338 Lapua rifle will take off a limb and drop an enemy, but a medium to light rifle won't. Which is odd, because like I said I own a Defender (RPR) and that 6.5 Creedmore or .308 is nasty lethal, I know the amount of damage the Creedmore and .308 can do to just about anything,  So unless they're wearing dummy thicc leg armor, they should not be able to break out into a sprint after taking a round to the shin, let alone be able to yell on their radios after getting the wind knocked out of them if taking one to the ribs. But! Again, these rifles don't depict the real world, if anything they seem to fire the same round, with each rifle being light medium and heavy respectively, with the difference being raw damage. What also gets me a little bugged is the time it takes a round to reach a target at 1000m even. You see, I live just 1 hour away from a 1000m shooting range and I take my rifle(s) there almost every weekend, but something about the time it takes for the round to reach a 1000m target makes me raise an eyebrow. But I won't challenge that completely because of the obscene number of factors that effect the bullet's trajectory. With of course heat and humidity being among the list, since you ARE shooting in a mostly desert environment, still though, at 1000m it feels as if the rounds are a bit slower than what I'm used to seeing, lets not forget that all cartridges have different velocities, but I digress. I thought about doing a bit of math but then I remembered that I needed to take a moment to calm down, because I still have the privilege of going to the range to enjoy the actual reality of shooting long distances. And most importantly, this IS simply a game after all. It's not Arma 3! And it's not certainly not Hitman neither (Hitman is miles ahead), But one would assume in this day and age a bit more consideration to quality would take higher priority, I get that the Cryengine is tough as nails to work with, this engine isn't exactly commonly used in the industry, knowing this, I'm still mildly impressed. Regardless of what I said earlier, I'm not entirely against the price tag of the game. I never once felt as though I wanted my money back, but knowing what I know now, I would've held off until the game was posted on sale. Now whenever Crytek finally decides to update the engine to support Massive open worlds along with a slew of new features, I'm sure CI games will knock it out of the park from then on with every new release, Sadly, if anything this is a virtual copy and paste of the last GWC with new maps a few scattered features, and the same assets as the last game. It's still an okay sniping game, and we certainly need more of these Sniper shooters on the market. With all that said, I cannot recommend it fully, because it feels more subjective; an acquired taste for those who enjoy this kind of gameplay. I would recommend it at a lower price tag, or if it didn't feel like the previous when it's supposed to feel fresh. If you want to play Ghost Warrior Contracts, go ahead save a few bucks and grab the 2nd version, imo those maps were better anyway, just less distance to play with.",1622972283,1622972283,False,5,0,0.523336946964263916,1,True,False,False

To break it down this isn't a true sequel in my opinion yes it has new maps yes it has new missions but game-play is identical in every way. The unlocks are identical in every way. everything is identical to contracts except the maps and missions. Which is why I state that what you are buying is not a sequel but an expansion. Is the game fun; marginally, is it worth 40$ and being called a sequel no. Another glaring issue is the so called open world the maps are large but ultimately linear where you go from point to point with little choice about the path enemies are littered along the paths like breadcrumbs to lead you along your way and the designers insist you deal with them lest they interrupt you while you are sniping. I don't know what promises were made but I feel they were not upheld. I say this because I was under the impression that the so called long shot contracts would focus on sniping but that is the mission i just described. I would not recommend this game.

The game was okay. I had fun playing it but it wasn't anything spectacular. The story is pretty lacklustre but you wouldn't be playing it for it's story. The gun fights are okay but the slow-mo sniper shots got old real quick so I turned them off after a few, It's a cool feature to have though. 

I felt like the main missions were really short, as in, the main sniping sections. Once you killed off the main target (which ranged from Easy to Medium) you were done. There may be some cool way of killing them but I didn't come across them. I would have expected for my first play through to be killing Targets through moving objects or vehicles or some super small hole or something but it was as simple as waiting for them to stay still and killing them. There were moments where I stayed after killing the Target just to shoot everyone at the base or choosing not to kill the Target through the scope just so I could get something ""more"" out of it. At least the options were there.

The visuals/graphics are good. They're nothing ground breaking but I was expecting to get a lot more FPS or more consistency for how it looked. There were a few stutters and lag spikes that needed me to restart the game.  

I came across a few glitches:

I was on the ground, using my pistol, an enemy would disappear and re-appear behind me or in another room. This happened twice.

The tagging system very inconsistent, it would work then not work. I would have to restart the game for it to work.

It's an alright game for what it's worth.

I like the ideas and the ballistic mechanics being I shoot quite a bit at my local gun ranges here in Texas. I really want this IP to survive.

If you played the first its nearly the same with some difference. The biggest complaint for me is simply the length of the story for the cost of the game. I feel like personally I would like them to double development time, charge $60 and have 10 missions instead of 5. In 14 hours(hunting all collectibles) I am done with the story and 70%+ done on all challanges. By 20 hours I will have no content left to play at all.

DO NOT BUY THE DLC... Waste of money for guns that should already just be in the game. Sorry CI Games but this buisness model is just lame. If you wanna do the Shroud DLC for some skins for people who wanna support you guys and Shroud, fine. I spent $21 dollars on gun dlc of which I used none.... completely pointless.

Another issue I personally am not a fan of is the way maps are setup on this game. ALL are either 200m or shorter or 1000M or longer nothing inbetween unless you force yourself into weird places to purposely make shots longer. What is the point of ""medium"" range rifles? Also I would like the option to move into the ""Extreme Long Range"" map sections to use different rifles and angles or even different  strategies. You are forced to shoot extreme long range, which is fun but its basically a puzzle game at this point just moving the npcs around to kill them quietly.

Pros:
Good flow of missions
Good mechanics
Nice variation of weapons
Good story for a sniper game
Lots to do

Cons:
Overpriced for how much you get out of it, probably worth more around 25 or 30 dollars
No variation in bullet time just the same animation
Characters fire behind walls
No real penalty for quickscoping you can Faze up through the whole campaign
Only 3 animations for wounds
People wouldn't drop keycard

Biggest Con:
If any enemy finds a body or they hear something they just automatically know where you are and start shooting. 
This kinda feels like in cyberpunk when the police just spawn on you but instead with random bullets.

Overall though I enjoyed my experience, that being said I probably won't revisit this game often because there is no long range sniping minigames or whatsoever the only thing you can play is the campaign.

First, the pros (building on the ones that are present from the previous game):
- Longer ranges
- More unique gadgets
- More paths to exploit in the world

The thing that I disliked about the first game was the lack of extreme ranges (the farthest shot you could hit was somewhere around 500-800 meters depending on where the rival in the second contract was). This was definitely fixed in this game. The extremely long shots that you have to hit have a definite weight to them, as  leading your shots are not an option (like in real life. I mean come on, no one is going to be able to lead a person >1300 meter out). The sniper turret is also a life-saver (but you'll want to upgrade the range to 1000m). It's amazing being able to sync shots and take out couples of enemies at range easily. Last but certainly not least are the multiple new ways of getting from place to place. One of the most unique ways I found was crawling through huge fans and ducts above the enemies to get from one end of the facility to the other. No more being *forced* to go through huge populations of enemies to get where you're going. 

Now for the cons:
- A little buggy at times
- Kill cam can be a bit blurry when blowing open someones head
- Can be a bit hard to figure out what to do at times

First, there's the bugs. Now, it's not as buggy as the first game (in fact I only encountered one in my entire playthrough). The main thing to deal with this is to try and *not* deliberately break the game. Next is my biggest gripe with the game - the kill cam being blurry. When shooting the back of an enemies head, and them subsequently being blown to kingdom come, the kill cam will sometimes motion blur the head, not letting you see the carnage in all of its brutal glory. The next and final con is something that I personally experienced, so it's most likely not applicable to everyone: Finishing some objective can seem a bit obscure at times, the most notable of which was trying to get some people out of a freaking APC [spoiler] when rescuing Taheer from the prison [/spoiler] . 

All-in-all, a fucking fantastic game, and one I highly recommend getting. It definitely lives up and even surpasses its predecessor in some aspects.

I've played Contracts 2 for a bit over 4 hours now and I am well pleased with it. It seems that CI Games has really polished the apple with Contracts 2. 

So far there is a good mix of stealth, close in combat and of course long shot sniping. When I completed one contract and tried to retreat, enemies came in from behind. I hid in some bushes and I have to tell you  the sweats was coming off my brow.

I like using the bow as my secondary weapon, it really comes in handy and can be quite effective.

So I give the game an 'A"", so far. Well done CI games.

I do have some minor nits.  I wish I could shut off the little symbols over the enemy's heads, and of course I wish the recognition bar could be shut off. Both of these items would add to immersion for me.  I understand that many people need these, but some don't.  Contracts 1 had these as well, and someone made a mod which thankfully got rid of them.  I hope someone will do the same for contracts 2. But really, CI games, if you can kindly add it as an option I know a number of people will be thankful.

Oh yeah one thing is missing... and I suppose I can live with out it.... the hot chicks of SGW 3! :)

Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 gives you exactly what you would expect for a sequel from this long gestating series.  New gadgets, weapons, locations, slightly improved visuals, A.I that ranges from Stephen Hawking IQ to the average Karen, simple weapon upgrades/customization and a story you still don't care about.  You're here for the sniping and in that regard most people will be satisfied with Contracts 2.  A few moments I enjoyed during the first hour was watching a head explode in slow motion and using decoys to lure enemies to my anti-personal mines.  The first map gives plenty of opportunity for close-quarters stealth, medium range firefights and LONG range sniping.  One frustrating aspect I did encounter was a checkpoint forced me in a really awkward sniping encounter after I missed a shot and dying only put me back in the same spot with the same 50 enemies still alert.  The game is fun and if you keep your expectations in check you will enjoy the game.

Update Five Hours In:
A few more frustrations.  It didn't bother me too much in the first mission but now it's a pain in the butt sometimes.  If an enemy spots you, everyone in the local vicinity immediately knows where you are.  Even if you immediately kill the enemy who started the alert it doesn't matter.  Your position is compromised and depending on the situation it can be astronomically difficult to get in the clear.   This can be immensely frustrating when it's a base full of soldiers, snipers and turrets, APC's and minefields. I also had a glitch where a turret almost spotted me 50 yards back and even though I was way out of the turrets sight range the alert signal continuously beeped as if the turret still knew exactly where I was across the map.  Needless the say Contracts 2 has some bugs and major A.I issues that will turn some people off.

On the positive side of things I am still enjoying the map design, watching heads explode, killing multiple soldiers in one slow-mo bullet cam shot, shooting a grenade located on a soldiers chest assassinating my contract and killing several others, laughing at the bad voice acting and dialogue, dropping a car lift on a contract, silently eliminating a target a mile with no enemies discovering my whereabouts, using AP rounds on a cocky heavy armored soldier and pretending I am a good sniper even though the game tells me exactly where to shoot.  

Anyways I would probably give this game a 6.5 to 7/10 at the moment.  However I am still only on the 2nd mission taking my sweet time lads.  As I also mentioned in my first impression if you can forgive some jank you may find yourself having a good time.

Going after counter snipers  doesnt  help if  it still alerts the base that something is going down, also its super hard to believe that the AI can't send out an alert when the literal only  sniper i shot was on a rooftop higher up than any other  enemy's line of site and it still sent out an alert the moment I put a round in them...

The AI still will pull a rainman and instantaneously know  where you are  after you fire a  shot, no matter the distance. ""Oh my boss  got blown up by a propane tank on the other side of the base I'm on? That's no issue, I  immediately know it's a sniper  from 1300 meters away   on a cliff i literally  can't see. I slew over to aim at them instantaneously and are able to fire  off a shot immediately.""

It only gets worse in the shorter ranges. There is no animations or process the ai goes  through between determining where you are, and firing off a round at you. Doesn't matter if you are barely in their peripherals, or even  if they have   a binocular out looking in a completely different direction. the moment they see you they will snap to  you  and shoot faster than you can blink.

I enjoyed the last game a fair bit. Love the contract style approach, mixed stealth and action.

BUT the reason I stopped playing the first one is the reason I just had to quit to desktop in this game.. 
     I am a ~nitpicky lil turd~ for animations and gunplay. GUYS-PLEASE UNTIGHTEN THE SCREW THAT IS THE WEAPON TIGHTNESS AND JANK. Thank you deeply.   
                  
 -and now I continue for a few paragraphs why it makes me angy- 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WOW-
The level of clunky, janky animations really hurt the immersion for me personally. It is so annoying because some weapons like the starting pistol feel pretty good and have animations that almost look real good!
     So I was feeling pretty happy with that. Sniper animations seemed alright, the starting AK 
     felt so off and stiff it hurt my tum tum. 
(*I am an avid owner of AKs IRL, so I get extra nit picky butthurt about poorly implemented AKs.*)

-So, Decent transition from hip to ADS for the pisty, good and somewhat natural feeling recoil, enjoyable reload animation... Then for whatever reason... I purchase and switch to the second pistol and GONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-.

           All the natural weight and recoil and natural sway or movement is GONE. 
Not in a way like.....Hey, it's supposed to be that way.. different gun, different stats etc! right>? RITE>?
                                       NO,
 I went and bought DLC (blecgh yes I know, day one DLC...) to see if the SC9 pistol would be any better, since hey I'm paying extra money so perhaps more time was taken to make that weapon feel natural and smooth?!? 

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOP!!!!!! Tight and stiff as if I was holding a slippery turd covered brick.~

I enjoy both the concept and general mechanics of the game. I can see myself getting so into this game... but THIS IS AN FPS, and on top of that, one that is attempting to include some levels of realism (low to mild)
   Why is this nearly full price game of $40...plus my additional 7$ for dlc weapons that clearly should've been part of the game to begin with......WHY IS IT SO ROUGH MY FRIENDOS??? 
WHY the animations that feel lazy, why the tight as heek gunplay in a gun focused game?

I want to love you, Sniper Ghost Warrior Contractz II...        But I need you to try harder for these things. 
         I am seeing free to play, and 20-30$ games kick your lil gunplay to the ground. OLD AS GANDPAPPIES nuggies games even have stellar fluid gunplay compared to your game...
                                   
You've got the hitman contracts feel, sniping fun going for ya, so make the other supposed to be fun stuff ALSO fun. 


Thank you for listening, I'll probably try to play you again and goodnight.-





***----couple edits for ya and after thoughts-----***

quick edit thought- Thanks for replying developer, I thoroughly appreciate you wanting me to give some official feedback for the game. I'm sure that's not the criticism you are hoping to hear..thanks for being professional about it. I would be happy to reach out. 

So this review may come off very upset sounding..It is because I was very excited for this game! 
I enjoy many types of fps and shooters but I have a nice soft spot for contract/sandbox games that entice you to both enjoy a bit of hardcore, a bit of realism, while still retaining the fun that makes it a video game.
 So while I do enjoy other parts of this game or want to very badly, THE GUNPLAY is what I focus on because I know that there are some out there who value it very much like I do! 

(Plus I happen to pay attention to a lot of details and understand how guns function IRL and what makes them fun in game..Obviously it is super important to find the right balance of both, or the correct balance for the type of person the game is being made for..)

Overall, I enjoyed the time I played. Their marketing says ""21 missions"" but it's really just 5 maps with 21 objectives total. And out of the 5 maps, at least 2 were ridiculously short.

Sniping is fun and varied from close range silence sniping to long range with armour piecing/luring/EMP bullets.

The kill cam is nice but missing classical music as you wait and watch your beautiful bullet Headshot an unsuspecting Muppet.

Assult rifles fell good and are necessary when NPCs push your location like you're wife when get home from work late!

Many gadgets/toys and upgrades to chose from like a Dutch bondage store :-)

Audio is very good, the sound of the high range rifle as you shoot your load feels satisfying. 
Voice acting is suprising good unlike SGW3 which was soooo cheesy it made 80's porn films look like Martin Scorsese directed them!

The graphics are great at times, running 4k everything VERY HIGH at about 70/90fps feeling smooth like baby's bottom.  Slicker than a slip n slide....wetter than a porn...you get the picture. 

Level designs are varied along with weapons and gadgets so it feels fresh reducing the change of marrage....i mean monotony!

Positive Stuff:

The game is really solid and is a great improvement to the prior game. I really like the improvements to the UI, especially what they did with the guns, the guns are so much better in terms of UI you just can just instantly tell if you can get additions to an item and what you have on it, soooo much better than the previous entry in a way i didn't know I needed. the tutorial is a lot more informative, really showcases the cool and unique elements of the series. The sounds are fucking amazing. the sound designer needs a raise. The way the visor works is amazing, it's a lot more informative giving you the battery life. The new thermals are great looking a lot less bland then the prior and how steam and lights play with it create interesting scenarios where you can't rely on it. The challenges are actually rewarding and seem a lot more feasible and in line with what you should be pushing the player to do in a sniper game. The upgrades really give you better decisions and really give you a better feeling of progression compared to the prior entries, really giving you all the good stuff together rather  than having you pick between two amazing things they give you both and leave the choices for more situational improvements. The new mask design is okay I prefer the prior design but it's good. I love the dynamic between the operator and the Handler, it's really entertaining and they have character compared to the prior ones. Enemies feel a lot more reactive since they will zero in on your location. The game now has better accessibly for players who are less able to guess where the bullet will land, and this game needs that with the ranges the player needs to shoot at so mad props for that. I like how collectibles were handled this time the skins are a nice touch, the prior game's collectibles were busy work the skins really make you want to get those collectibles for the inherent coolness of having more customization options The Bounty system in this game is solid I like it better since it actually rewards you with points for the sniper guns, rather than just money, replacing the purpose of the collectibles from the prior game, not having the gadgets tied to points and having the suit upgrades only being tied to points is a good new direction, it allows the player to make separate choices rather than having to weigh too many options. Special ammo is easier to get in this game and literally is one of the first few upgrades you get, LOVE it. incentivises using them earlier and boosting a unique element of the game. The melee improvements are great, they really give you the ability to react in a panicked close quarter situation when you are out of bullets, or mess up a silenced pistol shot. The loadout while doing the mid mission exfil is great too, it really adds the option for the player to use the money they earned mid mission to get upgrades that they can use quickly and meaningfully. I like the changes to the heavy Enemy, the fact that you can't defeat him with a couple well placed headshots was originally annoying but they really means that you need to invest into special ammunition, a heavier sniper weapon, a explosive gadget or the upgrade that lets you knife them. It's great, just adds that additional layer of depth to the game. Changes to the way the game deals with saves and loads are a lot better, it's still auto saves which isn't bad btw but it does so more frequently, so no having to redo entire portions of the map. The new gun descriptions are amazing, they give you a quick way to understand why you'd use a gun, be it cheap attachments, low recoil, and why you wouldn't low stability, no silencer, lovely sweet and simple way for you to make a purchase decision.

Netrual thingies:

Loading was okay, nothing special but solid.
I think that the remote sniper needs to have a change where until the player fire's a shot at an enemy with their own rifle, the enemies will run and attack the location of the remote sniper rather than the player, Kinda was a little immersion breaking for the enemies to start firing mortars at me when the remote was shooting them and I hadn't been revealed proper. 
The detection system can be a little unreliable, enemies without the full red icon can be shooting directly at me from range.

Negative shit:

The game has a couple minor issues in terms of bugs, the first is that the first military jammer's fuse box was entirely bullet proof, which was kinda annoying. I had a black screen once where the sounds were playing but I couldn't do anything. 
Fps does pretty well most of the time but sometimes especially after playing for a while, the game can go from stable 60fps vsync to suddenly jumping on the 39-46 fps range, mainly during movement. 

more minor gripes, Noise reduction doesn't really tell you how far people actually can hear you from, personally I have no good idea on how to do that, the minimap would technically be one but tbh who looks at then when aiming down sights at some guy's head. idk, I'm not that good a UI artist XD. If the boys at CI games figure it out I'll be the first to praise it.

I preordered the game and got the delex edition, I personally don't often buy these but can I at least get all the skins and dlc guns, I didn't pay for the deluxe only to have to pay to get access to all the guns.

Conclusion I guess:
I really like this game, I'm still working my way through the 4th map and it's a joy to play. It's great fun. As per usual the number of maps are like ugh I want more but with amount 3 major locations in each map, 3-4 smaller encounters within them map and 2 bounties per map It's great fun. The challenges and the way they are handled just adds more to the pile of entertaining hours this game can give you, not to mention it's 4 tiered difficulty, nothing more fun than turning on the lowest one and kicking all the ass or turning it up to the highest and winning like a boss. Just be careful to bring the right gun and scope for the job, I ran a light rifle with a short scope on the first map and had to do no zoom long ranged headshots, not my idea of fun but definitely a stupid challenge idea for anyone who'd be up for that. Running and gunning is not really the best idea, unless you have the armor upgrades, those really give you a little more leeway. But to quickly sum it up, SGWC2 is like SGWC1. An elegant game where the sniping feels effortless (except when you miss 3 times and the alarm goes off because you're not really the best at long shots), stealthy (except that one time you thought the Deagle silenced would be silent but alert the whole compound), and fun (no caveat here lol) sniping game where you act all big brain and fuck with some bots :D",1622918859,1622925609,True,3,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

1. Lowest difficulty.
2. Target was at least 1300 meters away
2. The base (he was in) was located in the middle of the desert.
3. My position was at a cliff  in one of their camps.  My position was definitely not the lone high ground around 
4. Also, I killed all of the target's men in that camp before attempting to assassinate him.
5. He was in a group of 4 guys, including him and not one of them was facing at the direction of my position. Their group was at least of approximately 20 meters away from any other person in their base and most of them are behind walls.
6. I spotted two snipers in their base that clearly didn't even have a line of sight of their group and they were facing at a direction at least 120 degrees from my position.
6. I was in prone position with with very little window of visibility from someone on the ground.
7. I was using an armor penetration bullet and my sniper weapon has a silencer.
8. I shot the target and since one of the guys in the group  was in my line of sight as well, he was also killed. 
9. Remember 4 people in their group, so now minus 2 people who were killed with just one bullet and no one near them around. 
10. A second after I killed him, a detection meter came up and started to fill very fast and went full in less than 2 seconds which is insane and pretty unrealistic. And Please, don't start me up with ""it's just game"". YEAH YEAH YEAH, it's just game but if it's just a game why did the devs implement bullet drop mechanic? So their goal clearly was to make the game as realistic as possible but the hostile reaction is unrealistic.

Now let's go back to my scenario. 
Immediately after I killed my target, the two guys in his group run away for cover.. So why did the detection meter came 1 second after i killed my target? and it filled up in less than 2 seconds to make matters worse. REALLY?

I have only played 1.3 hours of the game so far mainly because I had One Single Goal, which was to see what exactly was new in the game... And unfortunately, it's a little discouraging for someone who had a lot of fun with the First Contracts Game.
There are only 4 issues I have with this game, only 4, no it is not bugs, it is the content in the game. Or I should say, the amount.
As we all know, Contracts is a 5 regions, bunch of ways to damage those regions, type of thing. At first, I was worried that such little content would be its back fall, only 5 places to go with 21 things to do... not a real selling point for a 50+$ game, right?

Well you're half right.
The issues with this game are quite small, but have a impact on me at least.
Keeping in mind I have only played the first Contract out of all 5 regions, so there might be things that contradict my issues.



#1: Ammo Types
A simple issue here is that there are NO new Ammo types, that's it really.

#2: Development Tree
Lack of full skill trees. This explains itself to a degree, but what really sets it in place is probably that the 2 skills I used most often to have fun were the Tracker Skill, and the Echo Location Skill. I adored these skills to get in and really feel the scene. However with this game, it lacks utilisation for either which connects to issue #4... Even so, there are some skill trees that are smaller then others, and they could be re-added, along with some new skills considering there aren't really any new ones. It feels like there isn't much impact from it.

#3: Loadout
The Stim packs are the only the item in the inventory, which is pretty disappointing.


Edit:
The second map is now completed, and I come to see how my first review about the Ghost Warrior scene being forgotten was dead wrong.

This game is quite fun with the combination of all three aspects of the SGW series, and has a variety.
I was initially taken back by the first mission and how linear it was, but after seeing the second mission, I had to take my words back. There was a lot more to do, a lot more variety in tasks, and gives the SGWC1 feel back into the game, while as can be seen, also having some missions that force you into long ranged engagements.

Though, I still would like to get into those compounds from the first mission, I can see the intent in the design of it all.

However still, the first 3 problems remain, this game is quality. No doubt about it. I could still pick at the animations feeling stiff, but in time I think that my main issues with the game and that, will most likely be fixed, or so I'd hope.

Content on the GW side still needs some work, but besides that, it has a lot of potential I can get behind.

I still wish I could give this a In between rating, but knowing that the team is fairly small and that this is what they are working towards, I have to say my option leans in a more positive manner.

Good Luck Devs, I look forward to any and all the content you might add in the future.",1622869152,1622914711,True,0,0,0.461607933044433594,4,True,False,False

This game [i]is[/i] an improvement over the previous releases and the devs have made some great strides in improving their formula. Unfortunately it isn't enough to justify the pricetag.

Pros:
-Quality of the writing has improved, the dialogue between the handler/control and Raven is well written and the voice acting is high quality
-The sniping mechanics and variety of weaponry is of a caliber that one would expect for a sniping game.

Cons:
-There is no real open world, you basically spawn in and walk through tight lanes to your OP and engage targets.
-Contracts are very easily completed, which wouldn't be a problem if there were more contracts in total
-Animations are very clunky
-Jumping/climbing seems to be restricted to certain predefined terrain
-The tutorial gives you access to a drone and turret but then immediately after completing the tutorial you have to pay to unlock the gadgets
-Very ""hitman-esqe"" in the sense of solving puzzles via sniping. I understand that many people enjoy this gameplay, but it isn't for me and it isn't what I think SGW should be going for.

Overall, the cons outweigh the pros for me right now and I can't recommend this. I wish the devs all the best and hope that they can continue to improve the game and the overall formula of the series as a whole. I won't be refunding as I think they deserve my support in this.

Game visuals 10/10
Sound/Music 10/10
User interface 10/10
Suspense 9/10
Fun factor: I mean... Come on man!  We're talking about shooting brains here...  You can't beat this type of fun!
Control and gameplay 10/10
Replayability 10/10

I don't often write reviews, and I'm especially concerned about what people will think of my strange addiction for sharp shooting games and for exploding brains, but WTH!

I had pre-bought the game a few months ago, again, something I had never done before.  So I was patiently waiting for the release day.  To keep me busy, I was shooting dead meat in Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts.  I had played 126 hours, re-visiting every single mission multiple times, digging out every little bit of meat hiding in each cracks and crevices.

Then came June 4th and an arrival of delightful fresh meat! (play background sound of Hannibal Lecter Slurp here...)

I only have 2.8 hours of gameplay yet, but the game already has this feeling of super fitting gloves!  It is as if they picked up right where the first chapter left us at.  So, for me, the good aspects are no long learning curve of game controls.  On the downside, it also makes this new chapter a bit predictable, hence, my ""suspense score of 9/10"" but again...  We're talking about shooting brains here, so the fun level abundantly compensates!

You will start off with some training material and tutorial, which I highly recommend doing, or else this could make the game a bit more difficult to control and to appreciate.  But if you have an urge to shoot brains, I totally get that, so you can proceed quickly to the game and come back to tutorial later.

The game is fast to load and gets you right into action.  I like to walk around a bit and enjoy the lavish graphics...  CI Games team really did an excellent job here!  But my growling stomach quickly reminds me I am here to shoot brains, so back into action!

The maps are large, so you won't get the impression of going through the game way too fast.  I already noticed a few areas I intend to re-visit later (in case some meat was left behind...)

I appreciate the automatic and smart automatic game save, which allowed me to pick up at specific point in the action before I got killed and to figure how to take that bastard's brains out!

So, enough with the writing for now, my stomach is growling again, I'll try to edit this review once I have a few more hours of gameplay.",1622897229,1622897229,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game mechanic is basically snipe but ask you not to get discovered.
Yes, contract means certain target elimination. You cannot enjoy the pure slaughter with sniper rifle.
Most of time you have to worry about corpse get discovered.
Challenges are also painful to finish. Like kill every enemy in a map and need no alarm triggered.
These challenges give you skill point as reward...which means you better finish them all.
I think I can't finish this game. Not enjoy it at all.

edit:
Ah...Yes. I am not elaborate it clear enough. Of course I know it's stealth base game.
I am saying get discovered in snipe scene. Close range stealth operation doesn't matter, it's super easy anyway. Even you get discovered in short range, you can just use rifle/shotgun/pistol to take them out.


Problem is the long range one, the moment you alert the target game only provide you three option.
1. Reload a save (the only option to me)
2. Stop them from escaping (which most cases are not easily be done, will talk about it later)
3. Waiting for mission failed notification and leave it

The thing is you get discovered then most of target would drive their vehicle and running away.
If you're not using EMP bullet as special bullet, then you probably have to load the save.
You may say why not use environment to stop them. Good question, for example shoot ""something"" to destroy target's vehicle when they passing through.
That involve what you think? Timing. And if you failed to predict the timing, you still need to reload save anyway.

Now, imagine the challenge like kill everyone(all long distance) without raising alarm.
Try to kill main target -> snipe rest of soldiers one by one -> get discovered? -> reload save
So if you are doing challenge, it would be like reload and reload and reload.
Of course you can enable the aiming assist system. But that would make game super boring.
But I would suggest anyone who want to finish all challenges to turn it on.

I’ve seen this franchise before and was always curious what it was about. But the series looked to me like one of those bottom of the discount bin type games.

Boy was I wrong. This game just rules. It has nearly everything you could ask for: stealth, kill puzzles, cqc, and sniping of course. This game gives off a tiny bit of mgsv vibes which is perfect.

I’ll give two negatives but they are hardly worth mentioning. Take these with a huge massive grain of salt because im reaching hard here to find a flaw. 

Straight up firefights are a not too much fun but the guns SOUND and FEEL are so great.  The desert environments aren’t my favorite but there’s been a lot of variety luckily.

Interesting design choice, I liked the fact that in the first game you have the choice on how you want your target killed.

The graphics are great, I'm also really enjoying the level design, visual framing and environment art. The characters models have also been improved too, and the gore is much more detailed now, I blew up a red explody tank and was very surprised to see limbs flying everywhere, even if that makes me sound like a psicho. There's also 3D blodd effects during the bullet cam sections, looks very impressive.

I think it feels like a polished entry, there's only minimal jank and it's things like some checkpoint placements, which I imagine is easy to fix.

The stealth is so much better now, and the AI reacts a lot better now both in long and short range. I like that they chase you down and flank you now, instead of simply standing behind cover like in the previous entries.
You can even break line of sight and hide now.

The game itself, for those who haven't played previous entries, is like a mix between Far Cry's open work mechanics and Hitman's contract structure. All of those are nice words, I like the game and it's to see it progress this much.
Sniping continues to feel solid and fun. Love the delay in those long range shots.

It improves on almost EVERYTHING that the first SGWC has. Trust me guys, any fan of the sniper ghost warrior franchise will love this game.

The one thing i thought they were going to ""F up"" was the gunplay.... did they? NO. No they did not. The gunplay is nailed PERFECTLY. The sound design is probably some of the best i have heard in the past 2 years. The level designs are gorgeous and very well detailed. The animations for reloading makes the gun feel REAL, heavy, light e.t.c. ""Assassinating"" or ""interrogating"" an enemy actually does not ALWAYS give you info now and when you go to ""kill"" the person... the knife to the throat is also very well animated. LETS NOT FORGET ABOUT OPTIMISATION!!! It runs smoothly with no issues whatsoever.... no fps drops, no freezing and no crashing (unlike SGWC1). The fact that you feel like an actual sniper now having to shoot from a ridiculous range rather than 10-500m in SGWC1. The attention to detail on the snipers too is PHENOMENAL, the animations for reloading and the customisation. The Ai is improved from the original game also. The contracts are harder and we have MORE gadgets!! The gore.... all im gonna say is ""brains"".

- all sniper rifles feel the same
- there is too much copy pasta (assets )
- boring same missions 
- no innovation , you even copied the skills from the tech tree from the previous version... gas granades ? really?
- exploring multiple paths is not even rewarding (there is nothing to explore)
- no animals ?

Please don't go with the ""contracts"" formula. SGW 3 was the best so far.
The open world formula was fabulous! And driving a vehicle was even better!

Thank you so much CI Games for this consequent evolution of SGW Contracts! I've been waiting for this sequel ever since I first saw the title card announced on the starting page of the store. 

I got about 30 hours of fun out of the first Contracts game (I have played all SGWs but enjoyed the somewhat-sci-fi elements of the first Contracts the most). I don't need 60 hours of gameplay, I have a job and a family and absolutely don't mind a sense of accomplishment after completing a game in 10 to 12 sessions. The games look beautiful, run smoothly, sound great, the story doesn't distract from the sniping, and the developers did their homework inasmuch as they took away all the (very few actually) elements I found annoying about Contracts -- thank you so much for the new aimpoint system on Marksman difficulty (I'm an impatient and casual player and don't like repeating things overmuch), for more quick-travel locations, savepoints, and fewer requirements of using gadgets (those with a higher skill level than mine are still welcome to them). 

In a nutshell, I look forward to another 30 hours of fun with Contracts 2 and its quality-of-life improvements. I hope the publisher will keep up the good work! Dear CI Games, please don't be fazed by negative reviews, some people thrive on being negative and for some of the reviews, I'm not even sure if the reviewers played past the tutorial (how you can criticize a game for a lack of replayability after you have clocked 0.7 hours in it is beyond me). And to my fellow Germans, the fact that dismemberment is disabled in our country is made VERY clear on the product page to those of us who are literate -- knock the USK, don't knock the developers!",1622836769,1622836769,True,9,0,0.561601161956787109,0,True,False,False

Since the last time I played this series, everything I remembered are all of those gun are not allowed to shoot further than 800 meters and gores are jokes (I played SGW3 and little bit SGWC 1, for sure). But i'm so excited when I saw the intro of this product: I actually can make a kill from 1-1.8km and the most important thing: this game now has new gores system and lots of improvements from SGWC 1.
Big thumb up for for CI Games. You guys did great jobs!

SGWC 2 has been improved dramatically since the SGWC, the graphics are extremely beautiful, we have more gadgets, the enemies are more lethal,the NPC's AI are better than the last game.
The contracts ""challenges"" are pretty great altho it's gonna take you more time to finish all of them cuz they are now more difficult than the last game. ^_^

You can upgrade your weapons, gears, armour, nades has a few of different kinds as well, you have your drone to upgrade as well, you have a pretty useful gun turret, you can change the bullet of your rifles and it has a lot of types including darts, explosion, distraction, penetrate objects, etc.

Also you can buy more weapons, upgrade all of them and modify every part of each weapon, you have your skills so with time you can make them better.

Well so many things to say but I think for now is enough and this is the reason this sequel is better compared to the the first one SGWC and better than the franchise of SGW.

Fricking awesome.

1338770,93180804,76561198411682998,0,27,1188,0,131,1706290044,"In an FPS, the way the shooting FEELS is one of the most important things to get right. They nailed it. Shooting feels perfect. The game is amazing so far. I am only a couple contracts in, but I have no complaints at all.

Gore: Perfect. Satisfying head explosions and bullet cams. Body permanence (to me a necessary thing that should be in EVERY game) you can shoot the dead bodies and they still react. Wall splatter looks great too. As mentioned above, the way it feels to pull the trigger, send the round downrange, wait for the time to impact and seeing the thunk as it goes through the enemy just feels dang GOOD.

Environment: Big, wide open spaces with some CQB mixed in (if you desire). Right now I am still on the first environment so all I have seen are deserts, mountains, underground, variety of indoor locations and giant vistas. 

AI: Good, if they spot you they do everything they can to get you. Radio for backup, chunk tons of grenades, man mortars, take cover and generally work together to try and take you down. I am only playing on the easiest difficulty so I dont know if the AI gets smarter as the difficulty increases or if they just turn off your assist functions. If the AI stayed as they are it would still be sufficiently challenging.

Performance: I have a GTX1080TI and an I&-7700K and I am able to easily have everything locked to the max settings at 144 FPS so they optimized it well. I have not run into any performance glitches, bugs, or anything else to interrupt gameplay or immersion. I am sure it is out there, I just have yet to encounter it.

Gadgets: Friggan friendly gun on overwatch for you, drones and more. Nuff said.

If i had to list the bad things, I would say that maybe the desert environment is a little drab (its a desert though, what do you expect) and the worst thing for me is the fact that you cant manually save. That is probably a good thing because it would be easy to try to pull off a risky shot and quicksave before the attempt and would make it feel like it wasnt permanent. 

TLDR: awesome game, great blood, good AI, wish i would quicksave, combat feels good and fleshed out.",1622827421,1622827421,True,21,0,0.654501736164093018,2,True,False,False
