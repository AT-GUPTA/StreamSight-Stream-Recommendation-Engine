There's a lot re-use of assets, not particularly a big deal, but those copied assets have certain hitboxes/cover mechanics that don't fit into the environment they were pasted in.
Re-use of voice-lines, the 'sound the alarm' one being most egregious.
Non specific and generic verbiage. It makes it feel either google translated or the voice-lines were pre-recorded for an *idea* then later pasted in.

I'd say, if anything, the game needs to have more difficulty towards the end of it. I had over 200k coins with nothing to spend it on, no reason to stop the train at different locations, nothing. I just sped through chapter 7 until 9 because there was nothing ""forcing"" me to stop.

Also, the Scout class needs a serious nerf or, some other kind of difficulty added to the game in that regard. My team that constantly carried the last chapters were: 6 scouts, 1 medic, 1 grenadier. That was all that was needed.
The scouts can stealth their way through every mission because they are as fast as normal walking when stealthing. Then they have their 1 shot ability. I brought the medic just in case I needed some heals and the grenadier so I could deal with vehicles and some larger groups. That was all that was required.

One side of gameplay is train management, which involves exploration/upgrades in the style of Frostpunk, and squad composition in the style of XCOM. It is not as good as either of these games in that regard.

Now after 90 hours played (and many more to come) I can say that I highly recommend the game, even if it has its faults.

First of all, I have to point out that so far I have only played the game with the Czech voices and in the Czech language, so I cannot evaluate the game in English.

Firstly, my first experience with the game was very bad and honestly I was very disappointed and ready to quit. In the first hour or so of playing, the game crashed several times and did not find the game interesting at all. It was confusing mainy. As a long-time fan of games like XCOM or CoH, I had an idea of what I was getting into in terms of gameplay, but I was still disappointed because the game seemed very superficial and underdeveloped. However, I gave it some more time (probably because I was a big fan of the developers and didn't want to leave the game even after repeated bad experiences) and I didn't make a mistake. Without a doubt, the game deserves to better communicate some principles or game mechanics, because many elements such as character attributes or skills are not described anywhere. INT, WILL and CHAR improve ""some combat stats"" according to the description, but should I increase my sniper's INT or WILL or DEX? What do I do? I really don't know. Inspire Caution increases defense and reduces attack speed. How much? Is it +10% and -10% or +10% and -50% or +50% and -10%? This would make a huge difference as the medic has practically zero damage and sacrificing one damage dealer for a medic is quite a big investment. I don't know...

Secondly, the game definitely deserves a significant increase in difficulty. Fuel or food require practically zero attention, as you get them absolutely everywhere and in absurd quantities. If you repeatedly use a small number of highly skilled soldiers, you can more or less run through every map, because your soldiers are so significantly better than the enemy (the enemies are greatly undermined by their reaction time, so the tactic just works everytime: Scout > run > spot enemy > Critical Shot > run > spot enemy > Critical Shot > repeat). Some roles like Scout are absurdly OP mainly because of their range with Death Zone and there's nothing stopping you from taking 10 Scouts on one map (Seriously! Try other roles, they are good too.).

On the other hand, the game is very often frustrating, for example, because on the highest difficulty (especially the hearing of the enemies) the stealth is completely non-functional, since you cannot sneak up on the enemy from behind without them hearing you and alerting everyone else. Due to the fact that there is no silent way to kill other than melee, all objectives that require enemies to not hear you are basically impossible to complete on the highest difficulty. Fortunately, no mission strictly requires stealth. Each is completable without it.

However, despite these shortcomings, I have to say that after completing 3 campaigns, I'm still looking forward to the next one, because I learned something interesting and useful again that I want to try.

In conclusion, I would like to tell you that this game certainly has its faults, but if you take anything away from this review, it's that you should give it a chance and it will give you something in return. It's definitely not a game you'll finish in 4-8 hours. My first campaign was something like 30-35 hours. It's definitely not a game you play once and never turn on again.

Honestly, play it. If nothing else, because of the historical value. The story of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires is absolutely unbelievable and definitely worth telling.",1708725375,1708725375,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat is not hard, but so tedious on any difficulty settings, that I began to roll my eyes every time I saw it coming. Not enjoyable at all. Should have been turn-based or something.

You can definitely stealth any mission with just 2 soldiers. Booooring.

Character monologues are prone to bad timings, more so if you're not stealthing.

There are basically 2 games - one is a train management which was the best part of the game and then there are the RTS/stealth section where you spend most of the time.

These battle sections are mechanically weak. Everything shoots and sees roughly the same distance which translates into the whole game being a loop of using binoculars to see what is coming, pausing the game, selecting all the enemies to snipe or anchoring your machineguns. Kill enemies, repeat. The vehicles are buggier than the real WW1 vehicles, enemies are easy to kite etc.

Big selling point is the artillery train. At the point where I could afford the artillery wagon, the game was almost over and I managed to get literally 1 shot out of the train. You see, I made a bunch of the shells, then sold them so I could afford the wagon and then at no point for the rest of the game was there any gunpowder left nor it was possible to buy rounds for the train. The missions were getting easier towards the end anyway so being able to disable tanks in a different way than lobbing grenades on it might make it way too easy.

The soldier menus are quite confusing at times but in the end the RPG part where you pick soldiers for missions to get the best outcome is fun. The squads don't seem to be super useful considering that the soldiers are tired all the time and you basically disband every squad after a mission to pick soldiers you still can use for the next task.

Throughout my play trough every time I started a chapter the textures around the train when it's in a station didn't load. The train also loaded in an awkward position and overlapped with the other train carts.
The pathing of the soldiers is all over the place, sometimes they get stuck on a rock or on a comrade and you have to assign him to another location. 
Vehicles also spawn in awkward positions and on a mission when I had to defend a truck, the truck was driving upside down. 
 
The game play is good, I like the management systems in play where you have to take care of the soldiers health, assign them to work on the train, to perform upgrade, to forage for food, gather materials, etc. 
The missions are quite big in size which I like and using the soldiers abilities is fun to get around enemies and plan ambushes or stealth kills. This part I enjoy a lot, brought memories of the Commandos series which I played it which a lot of joy.

Last Train Home is a squad based rts with overmap travel mode in which you ride your train filled with Czechoslovakian legionaries from the battlefield of the Great war towards the port of  Vladivostok and hopefully a ship back home to Europe. 

The squad based combat could be little more fleshed out and like so often some - classes outperform others. But in a single player game its up to you, to cheese or not to cheese? The overmap train mechanics are cool and the need to gather resources while still having to keep moving through in a environment that is becoming more hostile all the time. The train is pretty nicely fleshed out and full of nice little details. 

The Russian civil-war is unused and interesting setting and I found the games narrative of warfare realistic. The game itself isn't trying to be a simulation, but the people and the events are believable and the tone of the game is fitting to the story and real life, it is sad, grim and often your good deeds just end in tears and bloodshed. The Russian civil-war was a nightmare and neither the reds or the whites were the 'good guys'. 

Awesome game that I recommend to people who enjoy history, settings of the Great War and Russian Civil-war. And I have to give extra credit to the makers of this game for using full motion video in a video game in 2023.

I'm very much enjoying my journey through Last Train Home.  The story is engaging, the tactical combat has the right level of crunchy realism without feeling like a slog.  The ""base building"" and pursuit mechanics on the ""overworld"" map provide a great tension and frame for the missions.

It took me a little while to get comfortable with the User Interface.  Some things (like assigning workers to roles on the train) aren't the most intuitive.  However, after a short learning curve, now it seems obvious.

I'm really impressed with the attention to detail.  Each mission map is unique.  Each mission is a developing situation with interesting objectives, and there's lots of variety.  Each soldier has their own personality, beliefs, and abilities.  During a mission, when your soldiers spot an enemy (even if you're looking somewhere else on the map) there's a voiced alert, so you know to go check on them.

It's like the best parts of Frost Punk, Rimworld, and XCOM; in an amazing historical setting.

I find myself getting surprisingly attached to these soldiers and their impossible journey.",1708358543,1708358543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I did have a few main issues in the game. It seems like there are things that need to be fixed or balanced with combat. It's very easy to exploit very poor AI and pick off large groups of soldiers one by one. It's also fairly easy to get multiple machine guns or snipers set up and pull enemies in your cone of fire. I also wish that there could be more utilization of buildings as cover (being able to enter and shoot out of second story windows...)

The train part is most interesting, though they really need to improve how you can sort and assign jobs. I kept having to go down the list until I find someone who isn't already tied up on some other job. There's also not too much of a push speed up my journey, so I was able to horde a good amount of resources. It made the second half of the journey pretty smooth and easy to run through. I contrast that with Frostpunk where you constantly feel you're barely hanging on and forced to make difficult choices.

Чудовищная клюква от начала до конца, красные позиционируются, как какие-то инопланетяне-варвары, которые высадились на российскую землю, грабят и убивают всех. Белые вроде норм, но в общем тоже мрази и предатели.
Совершенно однобокое произведение, без полутонов, есть однозначные герои-преодолеватели-молодцы и злодеи-грабители-убийцы.
Но даже при таком раскладе - диалогов хоть и много >> они глобально ни на что не влияют, просто ручкой машут - ""вот тут плохие красные, ещё вот тут и вообще все они плохие""))
Багов вроде критических нет = уже неплохо
и там вроде по дефолту русского нет, по крайней мере выбор языка ""Русский"" в настройках стима не сработал, а в игре вроде только английский или ""аутентичный"" - в зав. от национальности говорящего

В игре вас ждёт весьма глубокая прокачка/эксплоринг на внешних локациях и приятная динамичная боёвка на миссиях.
Игра плавно перетекает из реалтайм тактики в весёлый паравозик и обратно. На клюквенных дровишках играется весьма бодро и кринжово. Даже красивые в общем ролики смотрятся местами угарно-нелепо-умильно.

Говоря о глобальной карте - тут никакого тупого открытого мира - поезд двигается только вперёд, останавливаясь/двигаясь по вашей команде.
Вы формируете и посылаете отряд на охоту/исследование/торговлю в окрестностях следования поезда в соответствии с требуемыми для заданий уникальными навыками.

Самый главный спойлер (который для жителей сибири будет очевиден) и цель в одном флаконе в том, что ""чувак, через пару-тройку глав истории - мы заедем в сибирь и лучше бы тебе к этому времени утеплить вагоны и прокачать зимнюю экипировку"".
Причём там нет закрытых разработок - сразу видно несколько этапов апгрейдов на утепление, это заставляет воображение рисовать различные неприятные перспективы отсутствия нужного уровня прогрева вагонов.
Да и ограничение по весу первое время не особо даст солить ресы на апгрейды - лучше продумывать всё наперёд или купить доп вагон-хранилище.
Можно даже математически спланировать будущие расходы ресов на апгрейды, т.к. всё прокачать не получится, а металла всегда будет мало, а нужен он почти на всё.

Lvl UP персонажей:
Прокачка тут вообще, наверное, самая лучшая из тех, что я видел в подобных играх.
Все персонажи уникальны по набору навыков, что даже при отсутствии диалогов персонально с ними даёт им некое подобие личности, а сама игра добаляет обширные возможности прокачки боевых и мирных классов (тут даже пацифисты есть) и взятия перков из вторичных классов.

В плане полезности на первом месте у меня штурмовики, т.к. они хороши сразу со старта игры и в принципе благодаря своей основной абилке - способны захватывать любые точки(без повёрнутых лицом пулемётов) и орудия практически без сопротивления.
Учитывая, что миссии обороны будут в большей степени в конце игры и большую часть миссий вы будете просто зачищать локации => именно они будут экономить вам туеву хучу времени + штурмовиками можно фейсчекать любые тёмные подворотни.
Для максимальной эффективности лучше использовать их парами 2+2 или больше, по желанию.
Самый мобильный и универсальный класс. Уступает по полезности только снайперам, но при наличии лишних аптечек может почти полностью в ряде миссий их заменить.
Рекомендуется иметь в отряде как минимум 2х основных штурмовиков для более гибкой и мобильной группы.

Снайперы раскрываются в силе ближе к середине игры, и они реально имбовые, прокачав даже всего лишь 2х снайперов до 3-4 ранга вы почти полностью решаете проблемы с рандомными патрулями и пулемётными расчётами, а запустившись с 4+ снайперами = вы превращаете любую миссию в лёгкую прогулку.
Я уже не говорю про то, что с 4 ранга эти ваншотеры могут вставать в овервотч и устраивать ещё более красивые аннигиляции артиллерии врага из ноувижена и просто прострела (с полной видимостью) любых узких пространств на чудовищном расстоянии.
И ещё одна неочевидная на первый взгляд польза - супер экономия боезапаса отряда. Как в фильме - один выстрел=один труп - идеально подходит для этой игры.
В общем я рекомендую значительную часть боевого отряда формировать из снайперов - ни разу не пожалел. Если в миссии нет ограничения по времени или разного типа волн/оборон - то снайперы чистят карту самостоятельно и с минимальным расходом патронов.

Далее можно в общем сказать про медиков, гренадёров и пулемётчиков.
Это чистые саппорты и они никак не могут стать основными классами в силу того, что их полезность ограничена и ситуативна, а бросать по каждому поводу весьма ценные гранаты и расстреливать дорогие пулемётные патроны уж слишком расточительно.
Медик даёт АоЕ баффы команде, что на выбор (или вместе) улучшает эффективность в боях с вынужденным использованием частичных укрытий/открытом пространстве и/или повышает боевые параметры, т.е. банально аурой бустит ваших стрелков.
В общем для ряда простых миссий вы можете брать отряд для быстрой зачистки вообще без саппортов, правда медика с баффами я бы выкидывать не стал, т.к. люблю играть честно и без лишних загрузок, но по факту гранаты и аптечки можно взять вторичным классом.
Исключения - пулемёт и мины - привязаны к своим классам. Польза саппорт классов раскрывается во второй половине игры, где враги часто любят вас заваливать мясом или техникой.
А вайпнуть 1 гранатой сразу 7-10 бойцов с танком или устроить засаду из перекрёстных овервотчей+пулемёта будет очень приятно. В этом случае можно поменять состав пати на более гибкие сочетания по вашему желанию.

В общем говоря о плюсах игры, надо также упомянуть и о минусах.

Тут уж со спойлерами.

Как только вы прокачаете своих бойцов, обеспечите их оружием 3 тира и +3СТАТ едой - игра начнёт входить в саморефлексирующий луп-цикл из повторяющихся действий на глобальной карте.
По крайней мере 6-9 главы и на последних этапах перед Владивостоком начали ощущаться лично для меня пресновато и ряд локаций я предпочёл просто скипнуть, благо угля и еды было с запасом.
Возможно я слишком дотошно вёл себя в предыдущих главах и слишком с большим жирком вошёл в самую морозную часть игры, но мне уже не было настолько весело, как в начале, доигрывал по инерции.
Да и клюква уже просто утомлять своей прямолинейностью и самоповторами утомлять начала.


Итого за идею 5/10(поезд едет-едет, сквозь снежную равнину...), диалоги(они просто есть) и ролики 6/10, микроменеджмент поезда и инвентаря неплох, но во многом слабоват: 7/10 не докрутили, чтобы это стало интересным.
В топе у нас геймплей: на глобале 8/10, на миссиях 9/10

The story, gameplay, and historical setting are excellent.  The game takes place on the heels of WWI, following the story of Czechoslovak soldiers, seeking an exit from Russia to their homeland.  This is a little-known corner of central-European history for many here in the United States.  It makes for an interesting story.  (The victorious Allies - Britain/France/US - recognized Czechoslovakia's political independence as a reward for their contribution to defeating Austria-Hungary/Germany.  This was called the ""First Republic"").

The game feels well-balanced.  You follow your train on it's journey, fighting battles and making decisions along the way.  There is sufficient variety to keep things interesting.  Events build on themselves and keep you interested.  There is a sense of looming disaster, similar to the feeling of being chased, that leaves you yearning for more resources to make it to the next chapter.

Your crew develops skills and experience, level-ing up, and the game has some customization that allows you to tailor your preferred gameplay.  Want go go in with guns blazing?  Want to sneak around like a ninja?  Want well-rounded squads?  All up to you.  You not only pick the characters for each battle... you customize what items and skills they bring with them into that battle.  For example, a Grenadier can use grenades, but also smoke bombs, land mines, etc.

The train offers crafting and research.  These improve your odds in various engagements.  During play I felt a sense of advancement and success that had me wanting to go further before stopping for the day.  Very fun.

Quests and side quests develop throughout each mission.  They are attainable without getting too frustrated.  I have not noticed any bugs or glitches after about 50 hours of gameplay.  I sense I am perhaps 1/4 of the way through the game but we will see.

Hats off to the game art studio and programmers for great graphics and gameplay, the writer for great storytelling, and the developer for giving us a new story about European inter-war history.  Highly reccomend!

It's a phenomenal, flabbergasting result that Czech Train Ninjas (or The Last Train) then clocks in at a 6/10. 

The russian civil war is a fantastic setting, the Czech Foreign Legion a modern version of Anabasis, it has every ingredient for a fantastic, world-class game and they just... fail to deliver on it in any way. 

Pros: 
* The game is serviceable, playable, few serious bugs, maybe one or two CTDs while I played it within a month or two of launch.
* The maps are not copy pasted or procedurally generated as far as I can tell; every mission is a deliberately designed 'mission', rather than just 'you do combat now'.  
* The combat system is pretty serviceable and makes for a decent xcom-style real time wargame, but you won't be using it most of the time. 
* Kooky looking interwar armored cars, unarmored trucks, light tanks, and heavy tanks are available to crew in various missions. 
* Armored Train car!

Cons:
oooh boy.

First of all, the enemy AI is nonexistent. They'll shoot at you but that's suboptimal. All you need to do is step out of cover, (or even just toggle your hold fire/free fire button too fast for your soldier to shoot) and they'll go ! and then ? and then walk a little ways over to you, look around, and go back to their patrol path. 
But if you do that again they'll go ! and then ? and then walk a little bit closer... and a little bit closer... and a litt- and then they walked into your bush and you stealthkilled them with no risk or ammo expenditure. 

You can do this on nearly every enemy in the game.  Bodies don't persist; they can watch you stealthkill their squad made and they'll go ! and then ? and then walk closer to investigate so you can stealthkill them too. 
You can easily finish some missions without firing a shot but with a double-digits kill number. Even a high one. 
Because it tracks resources you're encouraged to gimmick and stealthscum every single mission. 

Second, your Anabasis setting? You are initially pitched on how you've been ordered to remain neutral and both the Whites and the Reds mistrust you and you have to chart a difficult and uncertain course between two warring powers who you're under orders not to provoke if at all possible-

Then the reds declare war on you in the very first mission. That's it. You're going to spend the entire game fighting the Reds, only the Reds, and never anything else. 'Anabasis' and 'ordered not to side with one side or the other' just becomes ""yeah kill every Red you have the opportunity to"". Even when the Whites are occasionally portrayed as A Bit Dickish, the game bends over backwards to avoid you fighting them. (Maybe the norther routes are different, ymmv.) At the end of the game you fight one squad of whites and a tank. 

Well at least it has XCOM style basebuilding and- 
Actually just do every mission you can on the way and you'll never be hard up for supplies. It's pretty straightforward. 
* Research passive upgrades (insulated cars, uniforms)
* upgrade cars (You'll never lose any)
* you can upgrade your locomotive, but you get exactly two chances to swap it out over the entire game. 
* never needed to repair durability (or upgrade durability) on any vehicle. 

You will get annoyed at having too many supplies and having to ditch or sell stuff because train storage fills up. There's consumables you can buy or manufacture; a couple are useful but really, you're not going to need anything but occasionally some moral-boosters and some medkits. Though you'll probably have too much medkits because again, most of the time you're busy avoiding all combat injury as Czech Train Ninjas. 

Okay but at least the setting is pretty- 
No. They have a fantastic setting, the background of the Russian Civil War to draw on, full of insane and wacky characters on all sides. Everyone's committing atrocities left and right and- No. All you get are the Mysteriously Popular Reds murdering/enslaving/robbing everyone. They twirl their cartoon mustache and somehow are overwhelmingly popular for inexplicable reasons. The Whites have about as similar two-dimensional depth. Beleaguered noble defenders of... the Tsar? Maybe? except they're losing everywhere for unknown reasons and, and, and. Words literally cannot express how they bungle this insanely cool setting, scenario, set piece. 
I was holding out hope that we'd at least get Ungern von Sternberg as a villain in the final chapter. Like holy shit a coked up Buddhist Russian aristocrat who thinks he's the reincarnation of Genghis Khan, controls the Russian far east, and is fighting to restore the Tsar? How could you have the OPTION to include that crazy motherfucker and then just NOT? And just waste this fantastic historical setting on mustache-twirling Saturday morning cartoon villain Reds Bad propaganda more braindead than something that came out of the US red scare? 

And I'm not saying that because I'm mad that they depicted the glorious noble party of Lenin as villains! It's the Russian civil war, everyone's doing psychopathic shit. The guiding arc of Russian history is ""And then it got worse."". There's so much they could do with this and they just... don't. You have your Bad Guys and your Good Guys (occasionally rude). Instead of charting a path between two dangerous, suspicious parties who both fear you'll aid the other you're just fighting one of them and then maybe fighting the other (but not really). 

(Even if you ARE a communist offended at this ""commies bad"" propaganda, it's... so inept, honestly, I think you'd find it more amusing than anything else.)


They had so much to draw on, so much real life material to use, and they just don't even care.  That's the part that offends me. It's just so... BAD. If you're Czech maybe the thrill of seeing your country referenced at all in a big Steam title is enough of a high to soften that. It's got some generic Czech-PoV jingoism to it. That's fine.  If you're Russian, egads. Let me know. 

If you play this game, you're going to get the tone set very early on. The first in-game cutscene in Moscow. Your elderly colonel steps out to negotiate with the Red Army General Morozov, both flanked with their own soldiers. About ten feet apart, Morozov draws his sidearm and shoots your old man. Then RUNS AWAY in the cutscene while the Red Army guards shoot at your Czech legion guards like Imperial Stormtroopers and vice versa. By the time control is returned to you he's managed to run three blocks and the mission is to catch up to this guy who, again, *was ten feet away from you* to perform his sudden and inevitable betrayal. 


Honestly, it's just kind of disappointing. Sailing the Rail Sea and Mobile XCOM with Bolt Actions is such a fucking neat concept. The combat system they set up is pretty decent! There's an insane amount of potential here... it's not shovelware... But it has all the soul and execution of shovelware. It takes this fantastic niche concept, fills up the space in which a game can be made with that concept, and is so utterly mediocre it's almost depressing. The use of this cool fucking piece of history is literally just a skin, an aesthetic. Like a $40 real-time DLC for XCOM 2.  

6/10.

It is pretty decent game. You are a group of soldiers that need to leave Russia by a train after world war 1. there is two portion of the game, train and resource management portion, and combat portion. 
The train/ resources management happens on the map, there are points to scavange for items, trade with locals or hunt in a forest, you have to send people there, make sure you have enjoy food and fuel for the train. 
The combat portion reminds me of commandos but simpler. You bring 3-10 units into the combat zone, there are different combat roles with different abilities, enemies have vision triangle, there are low and high cover positions and there is silent killing too. The basic of such combat.

The game is pretty fun, the story is simple but acted nicely and make you feel for them a bit. However, the missions are pretty simplistic and any decision you make feels pretty underwhelming. Like saving a child vs raiding a village feel they should be of a big consequence, but in the game one will give 10% morale boost , the other 10% morale degradation which can be fixed by 1 cheap item. 
The resource management portion was pretty fun in the beginning, but it feels repitive now, there is around 4 type of locations you can send a squad to look at, and thats it. different portion of the game doesnt really change the impact of those 4 locations.
The combat is good, but a tad simpler than what i would've liked. It feels it is stripped of the details and kept the main mechanics. It is still good and enjoyable, but i dont feel i have to plan much, i am in chapter4 and combat feels too easy all in all, heck even running towards an enemy without cover and stabbing it seems to work just fine with just little bit of damage that can be healed while on the train.

Anyway, the game is good overall. Each soldiers have their own traits and biography (Nationalistic, Kind-hearted, Loyal, Survivalist, Religious, etc.). You determine the legionaries if they will live or die along your journey from Moscow to Vladivostok. Some decisions may affect your Legion. You may either sympathize with them as a normal human being or treat them as a soldier (Like ""You're just a soldier, just do your job!""). 

The combat system reminds me of CoH (Company of Heroes), it's fairly good. It's difficult to approach the militias with sneak attacks, but it will save you ammunition for future use. And also, THE COAL... THE FUEL. You need to scavenge a lot of fuel and food. Continue upgrading the train and make sure your operators (Workers and Engineers of your Locomotive) are well-trained and efficient in operating it.

It is well done, no bugs, runs well, no crashes.

Train and troop management is good as well.

But missions where you spend 1-2-3h sneaking from bush to bush gets boring really fast. Once you have snipers lvl 3 you just spend 95% of time with two snipers clearing the level. The other 5% you use other soldiers to have 1 or 2 ambushes on large enemy camps where sniper just cannot infiltrate.
It is fine, but gets boring after 5 missions.
Missions have variety of objectives, but you do them all the same - sneak, silent kill, sneak some more.

It's similar to Frostpunk, not just because the game takes place in a semi frozen landscape, but also due to having to manage the needs of your people, ensuring they survive. The difference between Frostpunk and LTH is that there is the capacity for combat, and this aspect is very reminiscent of the Commandos series of games from the late 90's and Noughties. Both the asset/manpower management and combat aspects of the game gel to provide a very rewarding and enjoyable experience.

You are part of a team trying to get home, but can only do so by travelling inside Russia, from the west to the east. As the storyline progresses alongside your train, the game's functionality is gradually introduced in a manner that is quite a moderate learning curve in comparison to other games (Frostpunk included) thus I'd bet not only will it suit experienced RTS gamers but also new ones. Areas of control and that require attention in game:
- Locomotive (You will have the option during the middle of the game to change to a different locomotive. I recommend the towing bull as it has the highest car capacity and speed is not an issue) 
- Train cars (each car has a role, can be upgraded, has heating options that are manually selected and I recommend you prioritise heating and comfort)
- Soldiers (training, roles, skill point allocations and morale management)
- Routes to take to Vladivostok (each route will bring different challenges and additions to the story)

Audio:
- Voiceovers - You can opt for either your primary language or the native language of your soldiers, with voice quality that is near perfect
- Sound effects - [INSERT 'TERRI CREWS EXPLOSIONS' MEME HERE] Very good quality albeit a little lacklustre when artillery rains down on the target. A little more bass would be nice.
- Music - Oh wow, it is sombre, depressing, and fits perfectly with the vibe of the game. But also, it provides a beautiful contrast at times when you finally do get a win (eg: searching for food, raiding unoccupied residences, hunting etc) and such wins seem to illicit a greater sense of satisfaction and relief as the death of your soldiers has been delayed, even just for a few days.

Graphics:
- On max settings, 4k resolution and DLSS enabled, it will be a picturesque vista laid before you with very detailed graphics and it won't tax your system too much, unlike Cyberpunk. They really did a good job on this side of things! Also, lowering the settings is a breeze and still provides an enjoyable experience at the expense of the quality of visuals. 

Interface:
- Ok, I will admit, it has its moments where the interface seems clunky, but overall, if you know what to look for, you'll get there. And there is plenty of guidance provided in tutorial pop ups.

Lastly, a few tips:
- If you take the towing bull, you get up to 9 cars of which I recommend you take the following - 1x each of artillery, stock, hospital, kitchen and workshop cars, with 4x infantry cars. This will give you freedom to craft everything (except vodka and cigarettes) that you may need as well as house up to 48 soldiers that you slowly add to in the game.
- The first car you are offered free of charge should be the workshop car. Being able to craft ammo will be a godsend and that leads me to my next point
- If at all possible, use stealth kills and save ammo. Then, craft ammo with your workshop car, selling ONLY to merchants that are not on the track or at depots you stop at. Merchants you send squads to visit give higher sale prices.
- Scouts - The best unit (IMHO) in the game. I take 5 along on each mission and they do the majority of the grunt work and killing, with support from machine gunners and grenadiers when you face waves in a mission. Get them levelled up and add to their roles medic or grenadier to make use of the trait that comes with those roles, and they will then become Rambo. The ultimate in-game killing machines.
- Check the traits of each soldier, as some may be prone to accidents, or may not be suited to working in the train but have bonuses for combat/squad runs, so it is important to apply their skills accordingly or suffer the consequences.
- Unless you know you have WAY more resources than is needed and need the space later down the line, don't sell your primary resources (coal, wood, metal etc) as these will not fetch as much as finished items at merchants. Instead craft items and then sell these; by doing so you level up your soldiers, making them more efficient whilst making a profit.",1707837466,1707892611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is fun! It's a little bit XCOM, a little bit traditional RTS. The management on the train is also fun.
But every mission is basically the same, unfortunately. The unit variety is very low; there's not room for many tactics, and towards the end of the game I found it most effective to simply blob all my dudes against a long piece of cover and overwhelm enemies with firepower.
When that wasn't workable, stealth it is- but the stealth is very slow and lackluster, and involves hiding your dudes in a bush until everyone's backs are turned so you can stab them with no risk.
Also, the train management is pretty simple. I'm pretty sure that at no point you actually need to ration supplies- so long as you hit the resource nodes along the way you won't run out. I ended my run by having to constantly throw coal and food overboard because I just had too much.

I hope there are games in the future that can build off what Last Train Home is going for.

A few QOL things I'd like to see:
1. Naming squads and making preset ones that you could disband, then reform faster in the future
2. Better squad filtering (currently a bit clunky)
3. A train car for heavy equipment construction/store/repair (it would be cool to drive off with an armored truck after a mission, but knowing there would be a massive weight penalty and it would cost resources to repair)
4. Always having access to a character's skills (currently limited in that they have to be assigned to an active squad)",1707584317,1707584317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It also covers a very interesting part of history that I was personally only little aware of and that I am now starting to read more about, i.e., the Czechoslovak Legion and corresponding events after the revolution in Russia in October / November 1917.

We are the commander of a small group of legionnaires, traveling east on an armored train towards Vladivostok. All of the legionnaires have their own personalities and desires, and we need to try to keep up morale, while violence increasingly erupts during the journey. We must also take more and more tough decisions, e.g., whether we should take (or even steal) food from civilians who barely have enough themselves to survive.

The game is superb in illustrating the poverty, the sorrows, and despair during these times and as such is similar to titles like 'This war of mine'. From a tactical-combat and management  perspective, I would say that it is also somewhat similar to the 'Jagged Alliance' series. Thus, if you like this type of genre, rich storytelling, and a setting that appears to be largely inspired by historic events, 'Last Train Home' might be a great fit. 

Obviously, it still has some flaws though. For instance, in one mission, the Red Army receives 
reinforcements, and from an animation standpoint, it does not look like that the troops are actually moving their feet, but are more being pulled forward on an imaginary line. Soldiers periodically also collide with invisible objects and get stuck. All in all though, the game runs very stable, and I have not faced any crashes yet either.

In sum, I think the developers really did an amazing job, and it feels like a lot of love was invested into the game. The art is fantastic in my opinion. Really, kudos from my side!",1707572380,1707576745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its setting, the Russian civil war, is criminally under explored in video gaming, its Real-time strategy gameplay in a time where RTS seems to be almost nonexistent and a solid to excellent presentation, voice acting and story. I enjoyed my time with The Last Train. 

The heart of the game, the combat missions, are varied, entertaining and in the spirit of classic RTS very open. The game lets apply a wide range of strategies to achieve your goals, and throws in enough twists and turns to keep most missions fun. The unmarked side-quests, events and the little easter eggs scattered around these missions was a fun bonus. The Train/resource management that ties these missions together was good throughout the most part, and I enjoyed that the narrative avoided black and white storytelling, showing both sides to have good and bad qualities, which made the story more interesting and realistic. 

The problems this game has is with its balance of survival mechanics. Its starts off tense and intense, but towards the end when things are suppose to ramp up, I had food to last for a month, fuel to last for 40 days and every cart on the train was insulated and cold-proof. The excellent narrative clashes with the gameplay at this point ,as the desperation the men display does not match our resource advantage. Besides this issue, the game has no half-way decent autosave system during missions, forcing plenty of manual saves or loss of progress. The Steath approach was also very overpowered towards the mid to end portions, allowing for some hilarious solo-man approaches where one speedy soldier simply rushes through and one-shots a Russian patrol before dashing back into a bush. 

Issue and gripes aside, I think the Last Train is a solid 7/10, a well above average game, and a good pick on sale, or if you are a history buff, interested in the time period or if you are a Czech, Slovak or Russian. This game does justice to all members of this conflict and is a loving tribute to the several brave men who died through this epic odyssey.

Game can be completed pretty fully in about 30 hours, 20 if you're not a completionist like me.
Missions lost much of their difficulty after you get instant kill skills on sniper about 1/3 of the way through.
Environments for missions are nice and varied, and they manage to make each mission feel a little different. Combat stops being challenging once you've upgraded all your weapons in the final few parts, though.
Watching the train run and upgrading it is fun, wish the character models walked up and down the train rather than doing stock animation.
Had the crew cars fully upgraded by part 5 but for whatever reason the devs thought that it would be cool to make it impossible to heat them enough for the second to last leg of the mission, which lead to soldiers constantly getting sick and harder missions. Why am I not being rewarded for my foresight?
Final mission is VERY wonky. 1st try took me 2 hours of dodging artillery while mowing down commies, losing 3/4 of my squad in the process. Determined it was unwinable, restarted. Had all my people grouped together to make artillery easier to dodge and it just started blowing up a random place on the map rather than targeting me, which made it easy to just quickly murder everyone and go home.",1707552607,1707552607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like that's it in the end of the day, it's not.   It's a fun enough game.  the story is fine. it's  -fine- 

But it's not an RTS. 

If you want to split hairs.  sure you have a base (your train),  sure you have resources (They're spread around all the individual maps,  pick them up),   sure you control units.  But that's kinda it.

It's not a base builder.     There is no, replaying map, with resources on it you gather to build up your base to build units.

Your train needs fuel to move,  find that by sending out missions to explore sites along the rails,   get everything you need there.  Units have abilities that you need to use to gather more resources from the corresponding resource gather site, if you don't do that,  you're being inefficient.   

Someone gets hurt,  they are wounded, can't dispatch them

Someone needs to drive your train,  Oh there's a day and night shift too for all the jobs on your train, micromanage the spreadsheets of it and make sure your people are getting enough sleep because if you'd on't they wont' fight well.


Does this sound RTS to you?    Cuz it's not.    What's here is fine.      But it's really more a management game that you occasionally have to risk your soldiers  getting shot on.   It's wonderful for the narrative and you have to make hard choices,  but overall you just end up playing each mission as stealthy, slow, and cheesy as possible because dead soldiers = bad. 


I wouldn't mind so much, but this is being heralded as an RTS.     So no.    

Whatever this is....interactive story telling,  Hybrid,  RTS?   I dunno.  X-Com but without grid movement?    You tell me,  because all I know is if you're buying this game -expecting-  a Red Alert, a CoH,  or any ""classic"" style RTS,    refund before your 2 hours, because it will never get there to scratch the itch.

Last Train Home cleverly combines multiple genres in one game, so what games could you know that feature similar elements:
- Faster than light; why: because you're on your journey without return
- This war of mine: the way you'll collect resources and how your soldiers are emotionally affected and how you need to take care of their needs
- X-Com: because you control squads in combat
- Commandos: because you can be sneaky as hell
- Jagged Alliance 2: because you control party composition, outfit and character leveling
- U-Boat: the way you manage your crew within the train 
- Bounty Train: because you can individually assemble and improve your train

to name but just a few that come to my mind right now. but it should give you the idea that there might be something for you in it as well. and it also offers you a pretty unique character leveling system which allows your soldiers to take on different roles, military and/or civilian. 

so you see that LTH offers you a wide variety of elements and a great love for detail, which is but not the best part.
 
the best part of this game is it's setting placing you in one of the most interesting historical periods you'll most probably know nothing about but which shaped the European landscape for decades to come and within this scenario LTH offers a great historical consistency so'll even learn something about European history while enjoying yourself

This game is like a combination of Xcom and Command & Conquer with resource gathering and survival added to the mix. The story and aesthetic is beautiful and tragic with a real sense of the hopelessness and struggle of war. It's fun of course but not the usual glorification of combat that you see in games. The sense that you are desperately just trying to keep your soldiers alive and get them home is palpable.
It's a complex game with the need to constantly monitor stats and resources, and try to allocate soldiers with the right skills for the right task.

Then you have the battle decisions. Do you take the experienced soldiers with their improved skills or the newbies to get them levelled up. You also have to balance which types of soldiers you use. Scouts for visibility and ranged kills, grenadiers for vehicles or large groups, and how many medics will you need?!

The difficulty settings, very cleverly, let you make different parts of the game easier or harder. If you like the challenge of the combat but not so into the resource management, you can balance the game that way, or vice versa.
Personally I found the defaults offer a good level of challenge, especially in the later game where resources become scarce and the oppressive cold is a constant threat.

The voice acting is first class. I love the ""immersive"" option which is all in Czech and Russian (but with subtitles) as it really IS immersive. On my second play-through I chose English which makes it easier to follow and the voice acting is also fantastic, but it feels less natural.

It's clear that a huge amount of love and attention to detail has been put into this game. There are decision points which give some replay-ability, particularly one where you choose to go North or South and you get entirely different missions and points of interest.

Where it might fall down is in replayability.

It's got a nice card-based strategy element to keeping your characters alive, happy and rested. It gives useful perks to keeping my crew alive and getting more, as appose to culling them to get an ideal crew. This trade off leads to more food to feed and less cabin to store them in, but more opportunities.  
The stealth could use some work. The ""huh what's that"" stealth is fine, I guess, but it leads to me weaving my troop in and out of an enemies line of sight to move him out of position instead of something more creative. 
The combat is fine. Position your troops so they get a competitive advantage and use limited resources to get an edge in combat, like machine gun volley, or grenades. 

And some other problems...
-Grenadiers randomly will decide not to throw their grenade if they travel a few feet to throw it. I've had this happen twice, and it's gotten them killed by firing at the enemy instead of throwing the grenade. 
-Troops who have enemies slightly out of their range and are targeted to said enemies will move out of their cover to target that enemy. Is it so hard for them to just, shoot at the enemy with less accuracy? Why didn't anybody think of that for this strategy-cover based game? Especially when all troops have very similar para scopes, I find it useless putting my scouts behind my other troops because they straight up won't shoot despite having rifles. 
-Bayonet charge won't work on a turret if it turns. If it turns around, your bayonet charge will simply slice at air and die to the machine gunner. Why was this in the tutorial if it isn't going to work as intended?
-Characters who are stealth mode won't move away from enemies line of sight, instead choosing the fastest route to get somewhere. I can understand this, but why would you have them move outside of the bushes to get to another spot in the bushes? It's super counter intuitive.
-Cant tell when a character is in melee or shooting. I've had characters straight up kissing the opponent and I'll mark him to attack, he'll reload his gun in front of the enemy, and get shot in the process. 
-Camera zoom is very limiting. I don't have to only see my troops 24/7, what if I want to periscope out to move them somewhere else, or have a better job seeing all the way around my troops instead of being so zoomed in. You'd think this would be a fine workaround but sometimes you'll be facing enemies on both ends, and pausing constantly on each end to time abilities and movement is super time consuming. 
-Characters randomly won't stealth kill in tall grass. They'll walk up to the enemy, stare at him in the face, (spamming to stab kill now....) and then they'll be found and killed.

Anyway, good game so far. I hope the combat and keeping people alive simulator doesn't get repetitive. And that I don't lose any more 30 minute battles to stupid bugs.

+ Good graphics
+ Great story and writing
+ Good dialogue
+ Unique take on RTS
+ Fun and satisfying combat

- It's too easy
- stealth is too powerful
- too many points of interests

1. I played on Commander difficulty and never lost any soldiers, never had to limit rations and never even got close to running out of food/ammo/fuel aside from not having enough equipment in the first half of the game. While the combat can be punishing (running into a machine gun nest will get you killed) the resource gathering on missions and points-of-interests is far too strong. I also ended up upgrading so many of my cars and managed to buy a hospital car one chapter sooner than probably expected so I snowballed hard. 

2. Stealth on missions is too powerful. The ""?"" suspicion from enemies is too forgiving. The cones for vision are fine (and much better than other stealth games) but one-shot stabbing is far superior than fighting normally and potentially having soldiers get hurt. 

How I would improve the game:
- Have a limit to the amount of resources gathered during the missions, it would be better if instead of resources missions had research upgrades unlockable - that way you're forced to stop the train to pick up resources more. 
- Include a time limit on missions to force combat and stop infinite stealthing, or at the very least include consequences for taking too long (maybe a certain amount of time passes on the train overworld too?)
- Stealthing shouldnt reward as much combat XP (other than maybe on the scout). 
- More random negative events, in the end I had such a strong squad so having a few of them randomly be unavailable due to unforeseen events would have made it more interesting. 


Otherwise the game is great, combat is very rewarding and I loved the defense type missions setting up machine guns, land mines and heavy weapons to defend a position. The story is very intricate and there's a lot of charm in the dialogue and options - I just wish there was more of it and fewer points-of-interests.

The game was already on a so-so rating because it has an interesting premise, but the controls are finicky, the soldier AI beyond braindead (moving a group about tends to cause the figures to get stuck on each during movement, soldiers will not return fire to 'avoid making noise') to a point where CoH1 did it better a decade ago, and the management layer UI is needlessly convoluted and micro-heavy.
Character progression also feels a bit weird and flat, but given the more 'harsh story' gameplay direction, could have been glossed over.

But when you combine a game that acts more like a chore than fun, with a bug where it just doesn't save hours of progress... yeeeee, that's a big NO for the recommendation.

For example, that the Czechoslovak legion was mainly engaged in looting and killing local residents, simultaneously fighting with space marines from Warhammer (each squad has a commissar with epaulettes and St. George's crosses!) in a vain attempt to maintain neutrality to some Russians, with whom their captain, whose story is supposed to be told in the game, is negotiating in Moscow. All the story, quests and tsks are given by characters the player has not had even a chance to get acquainted with and will never meet in the gameplay. Some sort of Schizophrenia 

It also turned out that “Sukhinichi” in Russian would be “Nikolaevka”. I guess, all train stations in Russia at that time were called Nikolevka (Николаевка). And Kaluga (in real 1917/18 - the center of the province, one of the largest Oka cities and even a capital of its own ""Socialist Republic"") were a small village near Moscow. If this game was set in Czesko, Brno would be a small village near Vienna, I guess. 

Also I found that almost 100% of the inhabitants of Russia at that time spoke Czech, and only the Bolsheviks used Russian, and even then only in battle. Everyone knows Russian itself was invented by V.I. Lenin himself while playing with Google Translate voice processor.

The Bolsheviks in game instantly kill all the locals they meet, but never take anything form them (!), leaving everything for Czech to steal. Why? With now seemingly reason (and nobody even ask them why), but as I learned from wikipedia, these guys somehow managed to win the Civil War (spoiler). I guess, some space marines shit idk or may be they just killed all non-aligned citizen (which is not so far from the truth, to be honest, but still).

But I'm honestly ok with that, I saw much more ""historical"" and dull games of the genre (f.e. this master-piece of shit: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227530/_1941/) and like to kill an virtual bolshevik or two myself from time to time (don't like pillaging villages though). 

What I really downvote this game for is the fact that the Czechs  there riding on a British or, idk, may be it is Czech steam locomotive, but it is obviously from the 1930s. In 1910's Russia. Time machine? 

In terms of gameplay, it’s almost a complete clone of that ""partisans"" game where you have train instead of a campfire. All the other stuff including killing a lot of ""bad"" Russians included. Yep, in ""partisans"" they also pillage villages and kill locals, even that was stolen.

To sum up all of the above with a classic Russian folk proverb: ""Nichuja není jasné, ale ne velmi to i zajímavé""",1707085224,1707126233,False,4,4,0.397567629814147949,2,True,False,False

This game suffers from some serious issues in terms of the combat. Fundamentally, your soldiers are just pawns on the board and they will attack whatever happens to enter their combat range. They have abilities they can use based on their class and will unlock a few new ones as they level up, though I've found that trying to use their abilities generally gets them killed faster than if they simply free fire at enemies. The cover system in this game is offensively unpolished. You can't get into cover behind buildings or around the corner of one. Buildings also cannot be entered which is a confusing omission. You can only use something waist high as cover, like a fence or pile of logs. This presents a bit of an issue as you can rarely get a squad of more than 3 people into cover near each other to where they can all hit the enemies you are in combat with.

The aggro range of enemies is also very very short. If they are outside the fog of war, they usually won't get alerted to your position and continue their patrol. This makes fights rather boring as you won't have to hold a position or move soldiers as more enemies enter the fight. Just move your guys and let them shoot until the fight is over. Reveal the map using the scout's binocular ability, rinse and repeat until the mission is over.

The missions are pretty hit or miss as well. They're generally just a large map with some enemies sparsely sprinkled around. It gets tiring if objectives want you to run back and forth over a large area. You'll have a main objective and some optional side objectives. The optional objectives usually just boil down to fetch quests. Not very interesting or inspired. 

The train management is fine, nothing to write home about. Just some very basic resource management and random events. It works for what it is, not sure how to make it better but it feels one note for what was marketed as a key aspect of the game.

All in all, for $25 it's fine. Try it out if you're curious, but don't expect a super polished or engaging experience.",1706908761,1706908956,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

As an avid fan of strategy games on PC, I have to admit that this is the first game in several years that has really grabbed me. Last Train Home has rekindled my faith in the genre with its innovative mechanics, thoughtful balance, and deep tactical gameplay. 
[h3][b]But despite all my enthusiasm, there is one wish would greatly improve the experience of players from Ukraine - the addition of the Ukrainian language.[/b][/h3]

The Ukrainian gaming community is actively developing, and many players appreciate the opportunity to enjoy games in their native language. This would not only open up Last Train Home to a broader audience in Ukraine but also show respect for the cultural diversity of players worldwide.

Of course, I understand that localization is a complex and resource-intensive process. However, given the high quality of Last Train Home and its potential on the international market, I believe that adding the Ukrainian language would be a valuable contribution to the game's global inclusivity and accessibility.",1706905515,1706905667,True,6,1,0.459311842918395996,0,True,False,False

If you don't know if the game is your cup of tea, try the free DEMO, which is long enough to find out. The only downside was that after buying the full game I had to replay all the missions from the trial version.

I really like the theme and the time in which the game is set. The execution of the game is in the manner of Company of Heroes in terms of combat. Then there is the element of taking care of your train which you must not run or it will affect the abilities of your crew which must be taken care of. She may be incapacitated due to fatigue or poor morale, injured, or some members you just need on the train. A very strong element that I recommend to follow are the abilities and characteristics of the crew, which are really worth using because they can strongly influence, for example, prices in trading or provide a bonus when finding raw materials.

When playing, it's really not worth rushing and completing missions by fighting. Over time, the game increases in difficulty and will show you that using the stealth method (which is really primitive) pays off. Not only will you save a lot of health for the crew, but you can also get some good ingredients thanks to it.
If you expose the crew to frequent damage, what happens is that the crew member gets a marked status that cannot be healed and has reduced abilities until the end of the game and is practically disadvantageous to you. I also recommend investing resources in the thermal insulation and heating of the train from the beginning of the game, because as the game progresses, cold becomes a big problem and you don't have so much material to upgrade later on.

The game has ""immersive mode"" where You can hear the Legion soldiers speak their native language yet at the same time they will forget how to throw a rock as soon as You switch that skill out before the mission for a different ability.

Technically You are playing for a legion and according to historical records it took 56,455 soldiers, 3,004 officers, 6,714 civilians, 1,716 wives, 717 children to Vladivostok and safely evacuated. Notice a ratio of 56 thousand soldiers to 1.7 thousand women, and 707 children?

The game has very ""immersive"" inflation of female population among the legion. They are minority, true, but not exactly 33 to 1. Also game features male characters that have ""pacifist"" traits or similar ""disabilities"", that prohibit them to take a soldier role and fight while I haven't noticed a single female character that can't be leveled up to take a rifle.

None of them are pregnant and with children.

What is this again?

A new kind of ""immersion"" where we claim that we are telling ""a true story"", but we have modern gender politics (female warriors) and censorship (no kids on the train) to adhere to what?

The only thing good in this game is music, loading screen art and videos during a narration scenes. But that can't make a whole game good.

The sad part for me is that my own countrymen of ""Troitsk Battalion"" were among these forces fighting their way to get back to their home in Latvia and for that reason I was really hyped and really wanted this to be a good game to honor their history.

Here is their story:

In the summer of 1919, as the Red Army approached Troitsk, General Ivanov, who commanded the Troitsk front (White Army), ordered the Latvians to take up front positions to the west of the city. However, commander of the Latvian unit - Captain Dārdzāns ignored this order and decided to head east towards Omsk. On July 25, the battalion left Troitsk and reached the Makushino station on the Trans-Siberian Railway on August 15, where they acquired a small train to continue their journey eastward. At this point, the battalion had 625 men. On September 21, the battalion reached Krasnoyarsk. Here, the battalion was assigned to the Czechoslovak 3rd Division, from which it received orders to take over the security of the railway lines west of Krasnoyarsk. At the end of October, the battalion was relocated and tasked with guarding the railway line from the Yenisei station to the Klukvennaya station. During this time, the battalion was reinforced by volunteers from Latvian colonies near Krasnoyarsk. In February, March, and April of 1920, the battalion continued its journey eastward and entered Vladivostok on June 13, where it began preparations to travel to Latvia.

On June 20 and 21, the battalion, consisting of 1084 men, left Vladivostok on the Japanese ships Neisli-Maru and Cikusenmaru. On June 22, both ships arrived at the port of Tsuruga in Japan, where the battalion transferred to the English ship ""Voronizh,"" which left the port on June 24 to head to Liepāja. The steamer arrived in Liepāja on October 3.",1706631012,1706631249,False,4,1,0.417928606271743774,0,True,False,False

I think the game did a fantastic job integrating the narrative into the actual game play to make this very immersive. I rarely see those 2 things intertwined in a game so well, in fact the only other game that I can think of that is equal in regards to meshing the story and game play is Kingdom Come: Deliverance.

In this case, the story is riveting and well told and the game play is extremely engaging between story elements.  I'm glad to see new things can still be made, and made well.

First & foremost I loved the pacing of the story and how I felt it reflected my journey. At the start for the few few acts your just a few legionaries with almost no money or supplies on a rickety train. So for the first half the game I found myself stealthing around as much as possible to avoid open fights, and save ammo. As the war escalates, my train improves, my soldiers level up and I have more money for better equipment so I start fighting more aggressively as we fight bigger battles with allies. By the final 3 acts I was completely engulfed and managing a lean team of super soldiers. 

The story has gravitas and keeps you engaged. Your actions in the field and decisions you make on the journey really felt like they affected the experience. You have good times & bad times, you manage everything to rations, train development and even typhoid outbreaks. Your soldiers will gain positive & negative traits as the game progresses and you do missions which makes them feel less like guys on a board and more human. You will spend a lot of time tweaking each individual soldier and get almost attached so their deaths feel impactful.

Game play wise I really enjoyed it, as I hinted earlier I feel I got almost two different experiences in one game. Both stealth and then heavy action. It can be a bit simplistic given the enemy AI is pretty brain dead and will always walk into ambushes but I still had fun anyways. 

Finally the game ran great and I only encountered one annoying bug in my 40 hours of game play. If you enjoy RTS Games and management I really recommend this without any hesitation. I really wish we got more games like this more often.",1705632637,1705632761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Rts side of things is decent, i have played a lot of rts over the years and this is a totally acceptable experience with the exception of one thing (in the cons section).
Tells a story that isn't told enough to the west.
Amalgamation of 2 genres in one game is always nice as its not done properly often.
Though lacking cut scenes the art that they use is quite nice and somehow fitting of the situation.

Cons:
Had a total of 5 ""crash"" incidents across 2 play throughs. 3 were because the train glitched entering a station making it impossible to dock without reloading your save (thankfully the devs seemed to have known about this as there is a checkpoint a few hundred yards before every docking so reloading doesn't make you lose progress). The two remaining ""crash"" type issues occurred while in battle, the game would suddenly tank frames and not recover unless you restarted the game ( my pc is no potato, I9 & 3080).
Game has some serious early game balance issues, It was to the point that it kinda teaches you that you dont really need several resources, that is until you get to the end when you need a mountain of them and fail the whole f****ng game and have to start over.
The RTS TABOO, the final con i will put on here is a pretty serious one for anyone that spends a lot of time with RTS games, your units will sometimes ignore your orders. And no it's not a ""fear"" status type thing, like you click and they verbally acknowledge you but continue doing what they were doing before. I had this happen MANY times during my 2 playthroughs and have lost men, good men, to a stupid bug in the game. 

Overall i DID like the game but the issues that plague it are super frustrating ones, I really hope that they can shore it up before they bring out DLC. Its another game with amazing potential that is stifled by the devs lack of willingness to take their time with the final polish of the game.

The game excels in mission playability, offering a satisfying mix of stealth and combat strategies, although it has AI quirks. The train management component starts slow but reveals deeper layers of gameplay, such as train upgrades, which unfortunately are not immediately apparent. Playing on the hardest difficulty adds a rewarding challenge to the experience.

I am thoroughly enjoying ""Last Train Home,"" a game that wonderfully evokes nostalgia for classics like Commandos, Desperados, and Robin Hood. What sets it apart is the intriguing train management process, which involves resource gathering, trading, and freeing villages from the Red Army.

The mission playability is flawless, with a gratifying blend of stealth and ambush tactics. Setting up a well-planned ambush, complete with a machine gun nest, brings a rush of excitement, as does using a grenadier for effective crowd control. There are some minor AI oversights, like enemies not noticing a stealth kill right in front of them, but this actually aids smoother mission progression and avoids potential overcomplication.

Initially, the train management aspect felt somewhat limited, with resource accumulation appearing as the only key task. However, after about 10 hours of gameplay, I discovered that resources could be used not just for repairs but also for upgrading the train. This feature, while impactful, is somewhat hidden; earlier knowledge of it would have allowed for better strategic decisions, like upgrading the passenger wagon to accommodate more soldiers.

Currently, I believe I'm at the midway point of the game. Playing on the hardest difficulty, I've managed to keep all my soldiers alive through frequent quicksaving and loading, which adds a sense of pride and accomplishment to the experience.",1705393637,1705393637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Below you will find my observations and reservations about the game in detail.    

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
- Beautiful graphic art and music. Especially models which look awesome.

- Tiny details like seeing your soldiers play cards, sleep, cook, take care of injured etc. 

- Really enjoyable fusion of Frostpunk genre (train part) and tactical RTS genre and I found both very enjoyable.

- The mood of the game is awesome and you may even slowly grow attached to certain soldiers as result

- Each mission feels unique and very often reflects terrain of the map from the train-part.

- Money is really tight, especially in the first part of the game so you really struggle and I loved it.

- AI for combat is really good - enemies use covers, try to out-flank you, use grenades, occupy stationary heavy weapons if it helps them. Like, it tends to be challenging to win a fight once enemies get alerted to your presence - so that's great.

- Realistic voices are awesome, with soldiers talking in their native tongue - I would only welcome an option to have Russian voices even for story dialogues (subbed of course) as they are voiced with Russian accent only (played the Czech version)

- Replay-ability - there are 2 main decisions which road to take and on the one I took I also had to choose from 2 roads, so possibly my next play-through will be quite different.

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
- Tutorial is lacking important parts - like for example how to enter stealth mode (it tells you only to perform stealth kill not how to do it)

- Tactical combat is missing very important elements like an order ""do not shoot until ordered"" or ""lock to cover"" as especially at the beginning I struggled with estimating firing distance, and would often order my soldier, who was in cover, to shoot at an enemy, only to see him run out of cover into the open and fire at the enemy  - of course he would immediately get downed.

- Stealth AI is severely lacking (maybe intentionally?) 
A) when they spot your soldier but only briefly, they do not check the spot where they saw them - no, they only walk a few steps closer, stare for a couple of seconds and then walk away, back to their position / to resume their patrol. This can be easily abused to lure out soldiers, making the ""Throw a rock"" ability completely obsolete (what is even worse that sometimes the AI doesn't even react to it)

B) when you kill someone in stealth, enemies are not alarmed to find their friend dying right next to them - they act only as if they heard / saw something briefly.

C) when you snipe someone from a group of enemies, his comrades will run towards your position in alarmed state, but that state soon turns off, if they don't find your soldier immediately, and start to act as if nobody died - they even play the same replies as if they were just imagining things.

- Story is fictive but at the same time quite confusing and ill explained - I wish devs went for more historical accuracy - it would be still super interesting and educative on top of that. Like for example the stress on neutrality while I am asked to help the whites all the time? Being told that Whites are my enemies now, only to have the next mission helping them out, then to have them called my allies and then again they are suddenly enemies? It wasn't properly explained in the game that White movement was fractured into various groups with their own agendas and each group had their own (often shifting) attitude towards the legionnaires. 

- I also wonder if no Czechoslovak legionary committed any crime (except for theft I guess) - because it certainly felt very black and white, with holier than saints legionaries and genocidal reds. I know that Red Army indeed committed many war crimes, even atrocities on civilian population but It would be great to have a more complex picture - with some reds showing their humanity and compassion too, and at the same time, the legionaries showing they were just flawed human beings like the rest of us.

- Encyclopedia is very brief, does not address what is fiction in the game and what the reality was (except for the Tsar's gold) + does not explain that legionnaires were not merely POW but that they actively fought against Austria-Hungarian armies but could not return home due to Bolsheviks ending hostilities with Austria-Hungarian Empire - that is the reason, why they were fully armed (POWs would not have weapons).  

- Missing Iron-man option to prevent me from loading a game (sometimes the temptation is just too high + there should be an achievement for finishing the game on Iron-man + perma-death.

- And last but not least, I encountered some minor bugs that should have been fixed by a patch this long after coming out. The bug of fallen legionnaire coming back to life after loading a save file only to see them die again was really creepy, though. And for some reason I was awarded with achievements for not having anyone die during the journey, despite 2 of my legionnaires dying. 
But I didn't get achievement for cooking goulash 10 times, which I did many more times. 

But all in all, I am thankful this game was made, I enjoyed it quite a lot and I am looking forward to my next play-through and the DLC Legion-tales!",1705357957,1705358361,True,121,1,0.886587738990783691,0,True,False,False

The art, music and gameplay is really well blended and atmospheric. Not to mention it follows the amazing true story of the Czeck legions fighting their way though civil war torn Russia. I do however have one bad thing to say about this game. The difficulty balance needs a TON of work. I'm the type of gamer who loves a challenge with these types of games but once you learn the mechanics its ridiculously easy. The last half of my first game on the hardest difficulty I routinely had to sell or get rid of resources because I was finding too many. You can get resources from points of interest, within missions from scavenging, and mission rewards. Another thing is if you stop on the tracks too long the Commies will start to harass you but even this system didn't seem to really punish you as I played. Later on its possible to lose solders to random diseases and stuff but it doesn't really hurt you.  Finally, the game teases throughout the first half that winter is coming and you should prepare by saving up resources. But as you progress through the winter section you will still be flooded with resources making it too easy. I could run all of my heaters 24/7 without worrying. In fact, in the last 4th of the game I just stopped going to resources nodes. 

My suggestion is to rebalance the resources on the harder modes and to perhaps limit quick saving. Quick saving needs to be there to help combat the jank you can run into with RTS combat sometimes.

There's a few places I would like to see improvements one their bug reporting website doesn't work.  I have no game breaking bugs to report just some visual issues like the train showing off the tracks at one point.  It would also be nice if when selecting resource gathering expeditions I could filter by character with those desired beneficial traits for the expedition.  It would save a lot of scrolling time.

All too often RTS games become point-click simulacra of war. Often only scratching the surface of resource management and the stress of battle. Last Train Home full on throws you in the deep end into the pool of suck that is the Russian Civil War. Between trying to level up your soldiers, pick the right roles for the right people, manage your coal and food so you can keep moving and not starve, oh and all the while trying to scavenge resources to upgrade your train so you can survive the deep freeze of Siberia, you also have to try and make some coin to buy new train cars. You don't absolutely have to do this, but you'll have to make some really tough choices if you chose not to buy additional cars. 
RTS battles bring your troops home tired, and if you're not careful and crafty, wounded. Which can put you at a huge disadvantage if you absolutely need to deploy your units before everyone has a chance to heal and rest up. Engaging in scavenging missions costs your squads stamina, and it's not even a sure thing you'll find anything useful. In fact, sometimes you'll send a squad off only for them to discover atrocities beyond comprehension, earning you no loot from a sacked village, and your units permanent debuffs, and exhaustion to boot. The game is an absolute slog of a strategy game and I can't wait to play it a 2nd time around with lessons learned from my first playthrough.

On the one side are a good many 'arcade-ish' elements, on the other are harsh and detailed mechanics that seem to fit with a more realistic approach. Combat is quite fun, but the pathfinding can be infuriatingly bad. 

There are a lot of merchants, but especially early on, buying anything at all is a major mistake. The pricing is steep and later on you will need every penny to buy new train cars. I made the mistake to stock up on fuel, figuring that this would be a solid investment. It wasn't. You lose the first train and pretty much everything in it. Last train home seems to expect you to play the game with previous experience in mind. In the same vein, there is a number of scripted events that will send out of map reinforcements. 

The real way to get necessary stuff, like food, is to do each and every optional mission and make sure to clean the map. It is very much advised to do so with as many stealth kills as possible. Bullets are expensive and they are actually a form of currency in this game. Money is hard to come by, but you can easily net 100 rifle rounds per mission. Once it is time to splurge for a rail car, you will be happy to have some to sell.

The combat and mission design is good, evoking both Commandos and old school Red Alert. The presentation and main story is polished, and I enjoyed all the non-english voices too.

But the train management is very dull and feels like a souped up mobile game. There are constant popups and level ups and so on, most of which don't matter at all and just add a few % of improvement. This is so distracting it took me until 3/4th through the game to realize I had gotten essential skills like ""camouflage"" and ""critical shot"", which completely changed the combat.

You pretty much see all the possible train encounters in chapter 1, and then you just repeat them verbatim for the entire game. Upgrading the train is just a tedious exercise in gathering resources, reassigning people, and then assigning them back to their regular job a minute later. This can lead to dumb mistakes, like leaving the artillery unmanned during an important mission. This should've been handled by having upgrades be a temporary job instead of a permanent reassignment.

It's also an odd choice that the official ""story cast"" does not appear on the train at all. There is no ""officer car"" or anything, but you constantly see their portraits, and they do most of the talking on important missions. This adds to the feeling of playing several disconnected games.

There are also quality of life issues that can ruin the longer combat missions. Save scumming is both necessary and tedious, and there is no auto-save even though the missions have clear arcs. Some more examples:

- It's hard to tell who is selected, because the portraits just move up/down a little bit. When a group is selected, one 'main' character does all the actions, instead of e.g. the nearest squad member.

- Pathfinding can be erratic and you don't see the path they will follow. Many attempts were ruined because a character went the wrong way and you constantly have to babysit their moves. When moving groups, it doesn't show you their formation at the destination. When moving a group into a bush, the game doesn't even ensure they end up _inside_ the bush.

- ""Silent mode"" combines both ""sneak"", ""stealth kill"" and ""don't shoot"". If you want your soldiers to run they will also auto-shoot. If you want to hurry someone into a bush, and there is an enemy in range, they stop like an idiot and start aiming. If you are in the middle of a battle and someone is still on ""silent mode"", clicking the ""shoot"" button will cause them to crawl out and try a stealth kill. It's so very retarded in practice, this should've been different buttons. Stealth kills are also glitchy near fences and other obstacles, which adds to the problem.

- No decent ambush mechanic. Soldiers will run out of cover like idiots if the target is too far instead of just waiting a few seconds. The shooting range indicator is vague and never explained, and it's confusing whether it's showing you your range or theirs.

- The binoculars encourage you to scout ahead of time, but this can trigger timed events early when your characters are still too far away. This could've been fixed by just warning the player that they need to hurry, and delaying the event until they actually get close.

All in all, it's a good combat game with some UX issues, combined with a dull management game that overstays its welcome.",1705214673,1705214673,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has a great atmosphere. The voice acting, sound design, and story are all top notch. Thats where the good ends. 

For reference I beat the game on the hardest difficulty. The game is a mix of rts and management gameplay. For the management side of the gameplay its very lacking. Resources are used to upgrade the train and aside from metal you never really want for any materials. Only reason I was even running low on metal was because I wanted to fully upgrade every wagon. Beyond that if you get a food cart you will have infinite food. Which is the only other concern besides the cold. You can alleviate the cold with insulation and heaters which run on fuel. The game tries to make it seem like fuel is a struggle to get while handing it out like candy. I ended up with well over 2k by the end of the game. There is very little in terms of soldier management as well. You can give them items to up their 3 stats: health (hospital cart makes that unnecessary), stamina (you will end up with an ample supply of meth), and morale (never a problem). You can upgrade their stats as they level up and increase in rank but as far as I can tell it doesn't do very much. I just chose the stats I gave them randomly.

As for the rts side of things is when it really starts to fall apart. Enemy AI has the memory of a goldfish and the hearing of one as well. You can literally bait an entire encampment into a bush and kill them off one by one. Sometimes however the AI turns on wallhack and radar and can instantly spot your guys and kill them in one shot. Which is another problem sometimes the stuff that happens doesn't seem fair. Its not that you messed up its the game just decided that you are dead. 

The game encourages you to play stealthily but there is one easy way to completely ignore that. The scout troop pretty much makes the game easy mode. They have a skill that instakills one enemy. It has a short cooldown and its very rare to fight more than 5 enemies at once. So you can just sprint through the map with a squad of 6 or 7 scouts and roll threw the reds like it was nothing. 
The only danger then comes from vehicles and heavy weapons. For vehicles if you use the instakill skill on all your scouts at once it will usually die. Except for the heavy tank which you only encounter like 2 or 3 times in the entire campaign. For that you have your trains artillery bombardment. As for the heavy weapons you can just walk behind them and stealth kill them instantly. Which again because of the braindead AI is very easy to do. 

The missions are all very similar. Go here. Kill this. Protect this spot. etc etc. There is enough variety to keep them interesting in the beginning but by the midpoint of the game you have pretty much seen all the structure models.

Beyond that I ran into very few bugs. All of which where visual bugs. Enitities and npcs getting deformed into the ground or becoming very large for a second. Nothing game breaking like others have mentioned.",1705118323,1705118323,False,5,0,0.540013313293457031,0,True,False,False

The good:
The narrative: Absolutely stellar. The narration by Langer is so wonderfully done, as are the cutscenes - though they are few, they add so much in terms of visual storytelling. I also adore how it ties into gameplay choices as well: the narrative very much paints a picture of a ragtag group of soldiers just trying to get home - and when a village asks for help to defend itself, you really do come to ask the question: ""Can I spare the soldiers and the supplies to do this?"". Neither the Whites and the Reds came off as cartoonishly evil either - both sides did horrible things throughout the story, but there were glimpses of humanity in both sides.

Immersion: This is probably the most immersive strategy game I've ever played. Throughout the entire experience I felt like a stranger in a strange land, fighting both the factions of the Russian civil war as well as the very land itself. 

Mechanics: The foundational mechanics of the game are very solid, and it felt incredibly satisfying to face a head-on assault when you've found a defensible position, or when you manage to outflank an enemy strongpoint. It should also be said that the interplay between the train management and the tactical gameplay is done very well. While you are essentially playing two different games, I often found myself taking actions in one of the modes that would help me in the other.

Graphics: They're not extraordinary, but the visual design of the game is solid, and is definitely good enough to immerse. I feel like it does the subject matter and era perfect justice. 

The less good:
Balance: Some classes are just straight up better than others, to the point of obsolescence. There's little incentive to use anything other than a group of scouts to do most missions, seeing as precision fire is almost always better than machine guns, because the enemies you face are few and easily isolated. Never really found a need for riflemen at all beyond the first few missions. 

Enemy AI: The enemy can often be cheesed, and supposedly difficult encounters can sometimes be entirely circumvented by making the AI abandon their positions and chase you around the map. The AI is also bad at noticing you, often looking point blank at you for two whole seconds before opening fire, even though you just backstabbed the soldier in front of them. 

All in all, I loved this game, and strongly recommend it for any fans of RTS:s I'm hoping that there will be more content released for the game, and hopefully some balance patches as well. And I'm immensely grateful to the studio for making such a wonderful game.",1705098610,1705098610,True,1,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False

50+ hours for my first playthrough. Exhausted binge play. Im as weary as the soldiers. There are ones Im glad to have gotten through and I can recall the face of the diseased loyal trooper I left in the snow. Its a great emotional journey as well as a decent tactical+management game.

Original:
Keeper. 
WW1 game that Xcom fans would like.
My funds are tight at the moment so its great to see games coming out under $40 Canadian. Im sure Ill pass the 1 hour per $ guideline.
Tactical battles are real time pausable. This lets you arrange complex networks of movement and weapon usage. Felt like it was a competent squad. Ive heard of odd AI hiccups but you can reload.
There is another level of managing the train. That train holds your gear, consumables (medics in battles use up supplies as do weapons ammunition). You can upgrade the cars. 
In that way feels like XCOM series with a tactical battle amid base management and squad organizing. 
Enjoying it.

A very enjoyable game overall with very few flaws. Overall the story is well written and makes you feel for the legionaries under your command, and makes you feel invested in their survival and their state in the game. The missions are fun although slightly repetitive after some time, especially when you finally have a decent number of experienced soldiers. The resource management system is good although if you are to loot everything upon your path as I did, on the Commander difficulty and no modifications, it makes the game very manageable with very little rationing or resource sacrificing needed. I do wish that there was a easier way to upgrade the train as you go, or more risk/reward type encounters to make it so you can fully upgrade the train without having to stop for every resource along the way.

The main gripe for the game is the combat system, which while it is a good system, takes a decent amount of time to get used too with unfortunately too little of a tutorial for the system, and especially its stealth mode. There is a early game mission [spoiler]Infiltrate the Red Camp[/spoiler] that revolves around stealth, however its stealth system is not explained until after said stealth mission. Also there is one class in particular that makes the game almost laughably easy at times, which is the [spoiler]Scout class with the camouflage and ghost perks[/spoiler] which allow you to clear a map almost as a one man army. And if you have multiple with the [spoiler]Critical Shot[/spoiler] perk it makes it even easier.

Overall though I would recommend the game for anyone who enjoys RTS strategy games, as it is a very enjoyable game to play. Also play on the Immersive dialogue/voice option, as it has much more emotion to it that the English voices.",1704894647,1704894647,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Nice strategy with great story inspired by real event

Plays bit like mix of Frostpunk, Banner Saga and Dawn of War. Some lines sound bit flat and some hillarious but audio is great, so is 2D art, 3D is okay for RTS. Most of negative reviews is because of all factions being somewhat questionable and Reds playing antagonist in story or AI being dumber than average Russian. With bugs (dec2023) it's bit russian roulette.
 For me it was just some failing achievements and funny frames, some had easy sailing and some had crashes or serious bugs needing troubleshooting. It's still shortly after release and devs seem to be interested in fixing it.

Also some tips for you: [spoiler] 
-upgrade fuel efficiency (engine) and keep Grandpa (it's best engine)
-research faster boots and advanced winter uniform (engineering car)
-deploy and extract in triangle under aprox. 70deg so train can ride longer before waiting
-maintain morale between 70 and 90 by rations (beyond Moscow)
-replace medics (except one with aura) by scouts with heal and grenadiers by scouts or riflemen with grenade
-have someone cooking soup (kitchen car)
-...oh also consider replacing artillery car with aditional infantry car
-insulate infantry cars
-use burglar and housekeeper in salvage squad

Where this game lacks is in its gameplay. The strategic layer is shallow, but overall passable I guess. I would like to see more options for giving troops nicknames or being able to somehow mark favorites since it is a pain to remember everyone's portrait once you get farther in the game. 

The combat or tactical maps however or laughably bad. You can cheese an entire map with one scout unit. The AI is some of the dumbest I have seen. They just watch their friends walk into a bush and die over and over again before doing the same thing. You can also just run up to someone with a scout, use Critical Shot to one tap them, then run away and the AI go back to being relaxed after about 10 seconds. Rinse and repeat either one of these strategies and there is no need for the other classes. The controls also feel janky in the tactical layer, sometimes units get stuck on map objects or other units, they occasionally won't shoot even when they have LOS on an enemy and aren't in silent mode, and some of the tall grass has inconsistent indicators in regards to if you units will be hidden or not when you hover your mouse over it.

Although you shouldn't take everything in here at face value (like with anything else), it does a great job at immersing you into a very tumultuous time period within Russia.

The combat feels like a mix of Company of Heroes and Men of War but with stealth mechanics integrated in. And all on the backdrop of your only way out of a disintegrating former empire, the Train itself, where you will be managing your resources and deciding what takes priority (do you want to produce more ammo or better clothing for the harsh winter? Will you need to upgrade your Locamotive with armored plates or improve its maintenance upkeep? Should you deal with the rats in your food supplies or meh?). All of these decisions can and will have an impact on how well you do when boots are on the ground.

Last Train Home: A Gripping Journey Through Russian Chaos
Last Train Home, a blend of real-time strategy, resource management, and historical narrative, throws you into the heart of the Russian Civil War aboard an armored train full of weary soldiers longing for home. As their leader, you'll face a constant struggle to keep them alive, your train operational, and hope flickering amidst the brutal realities of war.

Strengths:

Unique Premise: The armored train as your base and mobile home is a novel concept that breathes fresh air into the strategy genre. You'll constantly juggle repairs, defenses, and upgrades while navigating a hostile landscape.
Compelling Narrative: The story, inspired by the true journey of the Czechoslovak Legion, is woven seamlessly into the gameplay. Witnessing the camaraderie and despair of your soldiers amidst the chaos of revolution adds emotional depth to the strategic decisions.
Deep Resource Management: Food, fuel, ammunition – they're all precious commodities, forcing you to prioritize and adapt. Scavenging, trading, and even resorting to desperate measures become part of the survival dance.
Challenging Combat: From skirmishes to full-blown battles, the tactical combat is tense and engaging. Utilizing squad abilities, cover, and terrain strategically is key to victory against bandits, Red Guards, and even armored trains.
Evolving Train: Upgrading your armored behemoth with turrets, workshops, and medical bays not only feels rewarding but also plays a crucial role in overcoming new challenges.
Weaknesses:

Steep Learning Curve: The game doesn't shy away from complexity, especially in resource management and combat. Newcomers might find themselves overwhelmed initially.
Occasional AI Quirks: Enemy behavior can be erratic at times, leading to frustrating situations.
Repetitive Objectives: While the core gameplay loop is compelling, some missions can feel similar after a while.
Overall:

Last Train Home is not for the faint of heart. It's a challenging, thought-provoking experience that demands strategic thinking, resourcefulness, and an emotional investment in the fate of your soldiers. But for those who embrace the challenge, it offers a unique and rewarding journey through a rarely explored historical period. If you're looking for a strategy game that goes beyond base-building and unit spam, Last Train Home is definitely worth boarding.

Verdict: 4.5 out of 5 stars - A must-play for strategy enthusiasts seeking a fresh and emotionally engaging experience.

Bonus Tip: Don't neglect the personal stories and interactions with your soldiers. Their unique skills and backstories add another layer of depth to the game and can even influence your tactical decisions.

First of all, as Czech man, with strong sense of patriotism and interest in both history and tactical and survival games, I was excited about the creation of this game, but sadly, I just cant make myself love it. Is it bad? Not really, its one of these better games that came out in last few years, but it could and SHOULD have been much more. Lets start with the technical state of the game - even tho there are moments of instability and slow load times, in 30+ hours I encountered only 2 or 3 crashes (which might have been caused by Radeon drivers more than the game), the game looks and sounds pretty good, has quite nice voice acting and cut scenes. The real time combat, except for laughable stealth, works fine, copying COH-ish style (which is good), without any glitches. The train management by itself is rather nice, choosing and improving train cars will be entertaining for some time, even while being hardly challenging, once you know whats up. Sadly, like many things, its very simple and stops being challenging and interesting after first half of the game, especially foraging becomes very annoying. 
AI is stupid. Insanely. Which is largely problem in combination with stealth, that allows you to kill tons of enemy soldiers just by running bush-to-bush and doing silent kills - while petty AI soldiers just walk around, not giving a damn - they can even see you running into said bush and if you dont slack around, they will just walk closer, allowing for more kills....its not smart, its not fun, its awful (only thing that stops you from killing whole maps like this are special events like enemy charges and the time it takes to sneak trough the whole map, otherwise you would not need other troops than snipers). Apart from that, enemy units dont react well to grenades, they just rarely try to run - even with grenades taking long time to explode. Another issue is with vehicles, which move like they were made out of cardborad, with no wheels, just being pushed around - also tanks dont have machine guns, which makes them weak af, especially in hands of AI and can be damaged by smal arms fire.

Main problem comes in details, the story and history, all the ""flavour"" around it. 
Missions are repetive. Of course you cant expect anything else than ""move to position and kill the enemy"" in war themed RTS/RTT, but there could be some variety, some sauce around it. Here, 90% of missions are move in and cap or move in cap and hold, without any added value, it does not feel very well (in combination with little to none impact of your action, it becomes tiring) 
The history part is clunky. Devs took some liberties with actual historic events and did not even bother to write in the in-game encyclopedia how it was in real life, which leaves lots of stuff to imagination and self explanation - like the Tsars treasure, which we KNOW was handed to Reds, while commies later denied it. But the game pretends that it was given to White army or trasported out of Russia...There is more like the role of Tsar in the revolution etc. Not good. 
I'm not the one, who would cry about Russians being bad - they were, especially commies were and are utter scum and White army was often lead by nutjobs as well, so no real heroes there, but these depictions of bad guys seem just cartoonish. The main bad guy who destroys your first train by ramming it by other train (its not like any other heavy obstacle would do the same, right?...lol) not only shows up randomly just to do ""evil stuff"", but in the end is killed off in some side mission without any climax or major conclusion...boring. Most of mission are extremely repetive and dont show any interesting events. Also you really wont care about your soldiers, even tho the game here and there TRIES to give you some insight into their human side, it all feels rather flat and you are not really gonna care - could have just ditched that completely. This is most visible in the character of Langer, who seemingly regrets something and is constantly mad at someone...but the game really does not show you anything you should regret, you dont make any controversial decisions or taky any bad actions, there is also basically nothing to be mad about (maybe except for the action with pressumed royal family...which gets resolved...into nothing really). 
What makes me feel the worst are the choices in the storyline...oh there are plenty...but do they matter? No....really like almost nothing you do have ANY impact on the game....yes, you might get few more troops (which you dont even need for the most part) or some small reward in supplies or ""ok that went well"" summary, but mostly no impact on your playthough.
The ending is also weird, just resolved like any of these ""take and hold"" mission, which have seen like 30 times in the game already and small battle, it just does not feel any special.

Overall, while the gameplay was not completely bad, its mostly all meh and leaves very bad taste in the mouth, as piece that pretends to be historical and supposedly should offer deep management and decisions, it somewhat tries to do all of that, but in poor manner, which is really, really disappointing.

If you're not Czech or Slovak, it will be better to wait for 50 % sale. (8 or 9/10 reviews are biased nonsense.)

LTH is screaming ""We wanted to add everything but we didn't have enough resources"". I'm sorry for them because it could be one of the best Czech games ever. Biggest issue here is everything in the game is halfway done. I'm not going to make a list, because it's really EVERYTHING. And since Ashborne Games are not CDProject, I don't believe they're able to finish the game post-release.

Next big issue is game's relentless pursuit of a depressed mood often leading to funny moments. You can capture 2 tanks + 4 trucks and singlehandedly annihilate every enemy in the mission, but mission debriefing is in the spirit of ""we've barely made it"". Your people could be happy and warm, but according to intermezzos they are ""starving and freezing to death"". Why? Just why?

I could get over all of this, but I cannot handle HDD era loading times (on NVMe)... and squad management - you cannot seamlessly transfer soldiers between work in the train and battle squad. You need to remove them from work manually and then they're available for battle. And it's nerve wrecking that squad aren't customisable groups of soldiers usable for different occasions. No. Every soldier can be in one and only squad, so if your main soldier is a hunter as well, you need to remove him from battle squad and only then you can add him to hunting squad and send him hunting. Now imagine you need the same soldier for missions, hunting and looting so you need to rework your squads before every task. This makes no sense in game!

If you care about things like historical accuracy/plausibility and logic, this game is sorely lacking.

Overall, the game's premise is interesting: a train of post-war legionnaires (note the two n's, instead of one) that need to get back to Czechoslovakia have to travel across Siberia by rail in order to take a ship home. This combined with the train and soldier management evoke good memories of similar games, like Frostpunk and Banner Saga. And if you never look past this beautiful surface of the game's exterior (which includes their cinematic cutscenes with real-world footage), the game is great.

But once you start looking deeper, the game shrivels up at an uncomfortable pace.

The first main issue is how the Red Army is portrayed. I know 'Soviet/Russia bad' is probably a popular sentiment in some parts of the world, but the game's writers take it to ahistorical and unrealistic extreme. The most egregious example comes early on in the game, when you encounter documents about Red Army activities that Captain Langer describes as 'genocide'. While I am sure that the Russian Civil War was not a great thing to be experiencing, the word genocide wasn't even coined until the 1940s, so unless Langer is a time traveler, this is not a word he should be using. I know the game has him narrating between chapters, but my understanding of his in-battle dialogue is that he is experiencing this in the present.

Likewise, the story's depiction of the Red Army as 1-dimensional cartoon villains is such a lazy copout. I don't have a background in Czech/WWI history, but I absolutely could have written them as much more compelling enemies to be facing. Now, part of this may be due to the logistics of giving a prominent figure a role in the story (which is us traveling thousands of miles across Siberia during civil war), but if we're on a railway, why didn't we end up with any kind of interactions with other trains? There ain't no getting off of this railway, but that doesn't mean we can't have tense exchanges with passing trains, or even have some prominent enemy or other be pursuing us across Siberia. Maybe this happens later on, but at the halfway mark in the story with no such kind of interaction outside two scripted events, I'm skeptical.

In gameplay terms, the developers have also given very little thought to how any military force would respond to: shots being fired, explosions being heard, soldiers being killed, soldiers disappearing from patrols, vehicles being stolen, and anything else I may have forgotten to add. While the RTS component of the game is objectively entertaining, it is woefully unrealistic, which sucks. If I stealth kill John, his buddy Mark should realize something is up. Either the fact that John is not at his post or where John was standing now has a large bloodstain (or body). The AI just does not care about the player's actions if they aren't alerted to your presence. Granted, there are alarm bells you have to disable or lock down with gunfire in order to stop reinforcements from being called, but with the exception of one mission by the halfway point in the game, alarms have zero consequences beyond the additional 5-10 soldiers they bring in. Big whoop.

The result? You can brute force a lot of levels with a handful of scouts and the game simply will not react in an immersive way. If I shoot someone, that should alert either the city's entire garrison or a much larger radius. Don't even get me started on vehicle/emplacement noise.

On a final note about realism, the game requires you to actively manage your three ammunition types with three tiers of rifles, short rifles, scout rifles, machineguns, and handguns. I haven't unlocked all the weapon tiers yet, but my impression is that one general resource, such as rifle ammo, is good enough for all three tiers? This doesn't even make sense. Similarly, I know that the game's economy would shatter if you could loot weapons from killed enemies, but non-officer enemies don't drop anything. As they currently exist, killing enemy soldiers either consume no ammo (bayonet charge or stealth kill), 1 bullet (Scout instant kill ability), or many shots. If I shoot a guy holding a rifle, he should drop his rifle (and ammo). If I shoot a grenadier, he should drop his short rifle and some grenades. It shouldn't just be officers dropping a random food consumable.

While some of these may come across as nitpicking, these ultimately add up to that meme of Krennec saying ""We were on the verge of greatness, we were this close."" The game had so much potential for a truly immersive RTS with train management elements, but at every single juncture the developers seem to have pulled the brakes (not breaks, as one of the many typos in the game state) on the cusp of greatness.

Hopefully, we'll get mod support so players like myself can look into implementing our own solutions for a better experience. I had a list of suggestions and improvements to make, but they exceeded Steam's character limit for reviews, so I'll see if I can append them to this in a comment.",1704241119,1704242321,False,7,1,0.461812406778335571,7,True,False,False

Gameplay gravitates around railroad and your train traveling on it when your unit of Czechoslovakian legionnaires try to make a mad dash to eastern coast of Russia and towards Vladivostok right when a civil war in its horrifying entirety is about to break out. Upgrade your gear, weapons and winter gear to survive your journey through the entire length of Russia right at the brink of Siberian winter while trying to keep your soldiers intact, fed and clothed. Last train home has very similar vibes as Frostpunk.

Now when i am done with the first paragraph, what can I say about Last Train Home? For the most part its fun. Resource management is fun for 4 or 5 chapters, combat is interesting in its own weird way (until you realize how to break it...), resource and management and bottlenecks are a real deal and overall package is solid.
In the fields of battle game plays as RTS. You have your squad, their classes and class specific weapons and tools, skills you have chosen and after a certain point your trusty railway gun. Enemy on the other hand infantry, armored cars, light tanks, heavy tanks, artillery pieces, machine guns etc. And they WILL end you if you don't play with outright neurotic levels of carefulness. Carefully choosing your positions is of utmost importance.

Overall its a fun game and it certainly isn't without its silly moments.. The stupidity of AI is legendary and it is quite possible to sweep entire camps just by poking your head out from a bush, hiding back in and bonking the patrolling guard down one after the another.. or if thats not your thing then 4 or 5 snipers are enough to sweep any map which doesnt necessitate you to protect anything or operate artillery pieces. Once your Lvl 5 scout Lvl 5 rifleman is unleashed on the field, carnage is legendary. Better respect tanks and gun placements thou..

The one BAD element in the game is its inventory cap.. game punishes you from being too successful in your resource management. Yes, trains have limited space.. but I don't remember a rifle taking same amount of space as few days worth of black coal either. The sole reason why I haven't finished this is because i got somehow bugged out, ended up with 6000 rifle bullets (in reality, not really such a large volumetric amount) and I got stuck. For love of gods devs just remove the material cap once player has max upgrades in cargo cart.. When player starts hitting their head to it they don't have any issues with resources anyway and rather than being an interesting strategical gimmick its more like an artificial nuisance.

Its a game that I'd recommend you play twice, the first time to learn the basics, and the second time to max out your characters, beef up your train, and ultimately board the ship at Vladivostok knowing that all 41 of your men and women that kept each other alive will enter their new home with a starting currency of 3000 coins.

That all being said, there are a few things I would mention that would improve the gameplay, and address some of the other review concerns:

1) Stealth combat is fun, but can be gamed too easily. Ways to improve: Require that you also must dispose of the bodies, that is carrying it out of sight (like the fuel barrels), else you alert their friends. And if the enemy sees a dead friend, then his vision cone should become 360 deg, and stay fully alert until killed.

2) The alert detection ring from gunfire/explosions should be doubled or tripled. Gunshots are loud, and yet when I started a firefight at an enemy base, only a quarter of the bad guys responded to the noise. I figure, if you want to disregard the stealth, you should be ready to face the entire hoard.

3) As many others have stated, the scouts are too powerful, but, the devs don't really need to fix it. If it bothers you, just use less scouts in your missions. I personally kept myself to just two max (for their binoculars, more than their guns), and I still had a lot of fun. 

3a) To be honest, I love the level 5 scout ability, as it makes my riflemen troops so much more faster in their sneak kills. Full speed + plus speed boost + total silence + bayonet = LOVE!! Plus, when you're doing a sneak mission, its really fun to have every single character run at full speed while trying to stay undetected. 

This is a great game, and I can't wait for the upcoming DLC.",1704171951,1704171951,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's a great mix of real time strategy, management, and history painted with a coat of WWI era bleakness. There's a surprising amount of depth here too in the gameplay, with some really creative maps and missions that kept surprising me with really one one single mission that was really unfun out of 20+. You can find a strategy that works for you and it'll generally work for you on all but a few missions with unique scenarios!

My only real complaint is the management portion is a pain early on and becomes pretty lack luster later. I'm not sure how to fix this, but by the end I was just selling excess resources (mostly fabric) because I virtually no need for it, meanwhile, I needed hundreds and hundreds of metal to do any more upgrades for my train. I've heard a few other complaints, but I think there's a ton of fun to be had with the game despite some rough edges.

Tbh I was expecting more than what I got out of this game especially with the train itself; as it is only a base for operations/movement. Still, I would recommend it for what it is. Some of the missions involving tanks are a little bullshitty and characters can be extremely sluggish.

Last Train Home:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

The Great War has just ended, and all the soldiers are looking forward to laying down their weapons and returning home. For many of them, this is precisely what is unfolding. But for one group of Czechoslovakian soldiers who are trapped in Russia as the Civil War erupts between the Nationalist and Communist parties, it is a different story. As Russia has closed its frontiers to the West, the only way back to Czechoslovakia for these brave soldiers is to travel by train on the Trans-Siberian Railway to Vladivostok and catch the last ship home. You will be part of this incredible, dangerous journey known as the Last Train Home.

Last Train Home is a strategy game developed by Ashborne Games and published by THQ Nordic on the 29th of November, 2023, on the Steam platform. 

As I write this review, I have played this game for 24 hours and completed four chapters. The game mixes real-time strategy and management, including resources and weaponry, and is topped by an exquisite narrative story with beautiful cutscenes and watercolour illustrations. While the goal is to reach Vladivostok, you’ll have difficult decisions to make along the way, which will have consequences for your soldiers (on their morale, for example) as well as on the circumstances you will face on the battlefield. 

The game is presented mainly as a map of Russia with the Trans-Siberian Railway track. At the start of the game, your train will consist of a few wagons, including an artillery wagon. However, you’ll lose that train early in the game and acquire another one without the artillery. The train will mostly have a few wagons for your soldiers and one for storage. You will be able to purchase extra wagons such as medical, cooking, or even additional soldier’s wagons, when you reach certain cities, but you’ll need a fair bit of money on hand to do so. 

The map will also show destinations of interest along the track, such as wood, gun traders, lakes, and houses, which may have different resources that you can grab. You can send a group of soldiers to these destinations and hopefully gather resources for your soldiers and train. Destinations indicated with a diamond icon are part of a quest, and those three swords means you will encounter a fight. 

On the map, there are two speed modes: normal and fast. But before your train starts moving on the track, make sure you have all day and night shifts allocated, as you’ll need an engineer and workers to get your train moving. Early on in the game, you’ll be able to stop the train fairly close to locations of interest, send soldiers to these locations and upgrade your wagons or locomotives without any issues. It is actually a good time to stock up on resources, because after that you will need to be careful how long you are immobile on the track, as Russian reconnaissance aeroplanes will start flying over your locations and might start strafing on your train.  Even worse, your train and soldiers could be bombed by heavy artillery shells, inflicting even more damage. You can’t miss the gauge, which will gradually turn red as soon as your train stops. 
There is a fair bit of management in this game, with the day and night shifts. But it doesn’t stop there; you can change rations and also change the equipment that the soldiers carry when moving into battles or destinations of interest. Be aware of the expertise outlined in the soldiers’ bios; their expertise can help tremendously when you send them to these locations of interest. For example, someone who loves nature and hunting would be great to include when sending a party to the lakes; they might be able to help find more food, for example. But you’ll figure that out that as you progress through the game. The most important thing is to ensure that your soldiers are not tired or travelling with broken bones; if they are, you won’t be able to select them for reconnaissance or salvage missions. 

You’ll be shown how many soldiers you’ll need to successfully complete a real-time strategic mission, with a maximum of ten. As there are only a few classes (snipers, doctors, riflemen, grenadiers and machine gunners), I strongly recommend adding at least one sniper, grenadier and machine gunner to your squad. Let’s be upfront here: the sniper class is very unbalanced in your favour, especially when it reaches level 2 and accesses the perk of throwing a rock to distract an enemy. You can literally use the sniper all the way through and successfully complete a mission, and it is precisely what I have been doing for most of the missions. Yes, completing the mission takes quite a while, but you’ll get there easily.  If there are armoured vehicles, the grenadiers can drop a mine on the road, or you need to acquire a vehicle with machine guns or a light tank. These missions will usually have two and sometimes three segments, and each one will have a few objectives to complete. The game will autosave each time you reach and complete one of these objectives, but you'll quickly discover that you also need to regularly save manually, as it is pretty much a trial-and-error type of approach, even with snipers in your favour. As soon as the enemies see you and even manage to sound the alarm, you’ll be in trouble and probably have casualties. One thing they have balanced very well is the hit/health ratio on the soldiers, both yours and your enemies’; it makes the combat phases really intense.

In most of the real-time missions I have played so far, the maps were pretty large, with a few segments each and objectives. Your soldiers can take cover behind objects (rocks, crates), walls etc, but some of these will provide better cover than others. You’ll also find resources while playing these missions - make sure you get them all as you’ll need them as you progress through the game. Overall, the real-time missions are very good, but I must admit that they need to do something about the sniper's unbalanced status, as it would definitely make the game much better. 

The graphics, illustrations and narration are stunning. The train and soldiers' management might overwhelm you at first, but it is, in fact, easy to manage, and the upgrade is really easy to activate as long as you have the right resources. I must commend the Ashborne Games team – this game is a cracker! 

Positives:
~~~~~~~ 
+	Stunning graphics, illustrations and narration including voice acting
+	Management system is easy to understand and use
+	Ability to choose different classes after a soldier levels up
+	Real-time missions have large maps
+	Accurate World War One weapons, vehicles and trains
+	Achievements

Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 
-	Sniper balance needs to be adjusted
  
Last Train Home is an absolute stunner of a game! Don’t miss this train if you love strategy games.

Pros:
- Fair amount of main and side activities to do, solid replay value at least once or twice
- Combat system is well-thought out and classes are balanced.  Nothing felt missing.
- Level design is solid and not repetitive.  All the missions felt unique and enjoyable in their own ways
- Music, art, and voice acting are all good
- Game progression and difficulty curve feel fair, but challenging
- Core gameplay of squad combat and base management are well designed and satisfying.  

Cons and Suggestions (Most of these are surface level and do not impact core game play or mechanics):
- Main Story, sometimes hit or miss with its attempts at moral complexity in the midst of the Russian civil war.  It feels as if punches are being pulled sometimes and legionaries are not allowed to be shown participating in crimes for or against either side, either commit to portraying it fully dark or lighten the load
- Additional Story.  Too many walls of text to read and too few voiced characters.  Seeing the same faces who are not actually deploy-able soldiers becomes irritable after a while, and many of their characters boil down to something too simple for what could be a 20 hour run period.  I suggest adding more immersive side story events and choices, or cutting down on some of the excess text walls.  These are well-written text walls and paragraphs, just not as engaging as they could be.
- Immersion: The addition of more historically accurate uniforms to the field for all sides would make the setting flow better, in addition to color palette changes so it is not simply team green, team red, and team blue.  Russian voice actors would also help significantly, as it is somewhat jarring to see the Russian soldiers joining your squad speak perfect Czech.
- Customization: Looking at XCOM as the key example, but the ability to customize soldiers in appearance, uniforms, voice, or even names could add a lot to replay value by allowing players to become more attached to their soldiers.  The same applies to the train, which could allow for customization of rooms, decorations, or other things to make each new playthrough feel different or unique.  Good modding support could fix both of these.
- Minor Tweaks: Though it may be intended, I noticed when a soldier was maimed or grievously ill, they could sometimes never recover and take up hospital space even after death.  Suffice to say, a way to help them or at least bury them would be nice.  Other small bug fixes on maps or with soldiers also would be nice.  I encountered game breaking bugs only once in 20 hours, and that was partially my own fault for screwing around with my saves, so the game is fairly clean of bugs.


All in all, solid 9/10 and worth every cent of the $40 for it.  Would love to see more games like this in similar or other historical periods.

I do like the game play and train management side however the bugs can be a little bit annoy, for example on the campaign map when I go and gather resources from lakes forest and towns some times the button is unresponsive. usually I reload the game and it solves the problem, I was pretty forgiving with that. 

There is a game breaking bug however where objectives will not load, my example in the mission red and green should never be seen chapter 4 I completed all objectives cleared out the village using a armoured car. I even cleared the map but I never got the objective to leave. I did leave the area and it said I failed the mission.

I googled this issue and it said I needed to talk to a villager but I never got that objective. it just said Take the village. maybe it's because I used a armoured car. But if that's the case this is a strategy I should not be punished for using alternative means. after that I didn't feel confident in continuing because am I going to have the carpet pulled from under me for doing something in the wrong sequence 

also I picked up four legionaries  in the end of chapter 2 but I didn't have another space for them. I did have enough resources to upgrade the train to add extra space but the game would not let me. it allows me to do the same with extra resources. why not?

I have played CoH and other similar games for years, and this one, although not perfect, is pretty good.  I can honestly say I enjoyed it, but by the end of the second play through, I am sure I will not replay it for a while if ever (we will see what they come up for DLC).

The Good:  Decent system of combat, but if you wish to have a more immersive experience without pausing, this game may not be for you.  There is much micromanagement necessary to keep your units healthy and make sure they are silent or in proper cover (sometimes this is the challenge and I mostly enjoy it, but other times I am just not in the mood for it, which often ends badly).  Individual skirmishes are often over very quickly.  Pausing play helps reveal the best places for cover.  Because you are limited to 10 squad members, plus some added in certain battles, it might appear to be easy to manage, but I reloaded several times as my click choreography was often terrible.  No one unit is stronger than any other, but the sniper abilities make them a tiny bit overpowered after they have leveled up.

I enjoyed the train management.  There are always stock choices to make in order to preserve the health of your troops later on, but...

The not as good:  

This is where the replay-ability becomes an issue.  I cannot see attempting a different build or how that would even make it possible to complete the campaign.  Even the locomotive choice seems pointless.  If you choose the other faster yet smaller locomotive, I don't know if you can pull all the cars necessary (since I never purchased it, I don't know if they have an option to upgrade to pull two additional cars).  The load-out was the same for both play through's, which included 4 infantry cars, 1 kitchen, 1 workshop, 1 artillery and 1 hospital car.  I gathered the same number of soldiers that required 3.5 infantry cars on both play-through's.    

There are a few fixable UI issues, like not being able to sort squad members for duty using relevant parameters (please allow me to toggle showing me only soldiers who are not busy doing something else, or sort by role rank so I can choose less skilled units so they can rank up more quickly, or have them drop off the list when they have been chosen, so I don't click them accidentally thus removing them, or reset the list to the top when changing to a new slot with the same car).  It would also be nice to see our inventory when making certain decisions during the cut scenes/narratives.  Some route finding needs to be corrected, especially when tanks start sliding sideways in order to navigate an obstacle. Some places that were obvious cover did not have a placement marker for cover.  Also, cover from the side was not cover from certain angles, leaving what should be a well protected soldier vulnerable to flanking fire.  Vehicles turn in place, including trucks, which is a bit odd because they are not tracked.  Also, two soldiers may overlap and you don't notice that one is not in cover until you see his health bar rapidly diminish.  The AI is a bit predictable and some careful observation makes it almost too easy at times, but others, happily, they can surprise you.  Another review mentions the spamming of Snipers - I maxed out at 4 in my squad at any one time as I liked the rolls the other classes afforded when chaos ensues, but, for instance, their special abilities almost negate the need for riflemen and their bayonet charge.  I did love using a rifleman and his speediness after he had been promoted to sniper ghost (level 5).  They run very fast while in silent mode allowing for speedy, silent take downs.  

The units on the tactical map only have two states, SILENT and LOUD.  While in silent mode, they walk very slowly (except for fully promoted snipers) and don't shoot when in range, whether in hiding or not.  While in LOUD mode, they will shoot anything in range.  Often I would try to run behind an enemy squad only to have one of my soldiers start taking shots at them exposing my units to enemy fire.  I often desired a ""move quickly and hold your fire when you get to location"" or the options that if you are fired upon, return fire.  Too often a soldier who was in silent mode would get gunned down just sitting there while the enemy showered him with bullets.  I tried to queue the run then go silent commands but this never worked consistently.

Also, I found some abilities underwhelming, or unnecessary. I never once used a smoke or sleep grenade.  I may go back and try them out, just to see what I was missing.  Land mines cannot be tailored to be triggered by vehicles only, so they have limited use if they are preceded by troops, and are rare to find, so investment in research becomes necessary to use them with any frequency.  This leads to another problem. Gunpowder is so rare, you have to choose between only a few options for research, and you still need it to build the devices which also take gunpowder.  I found myself looking for other game play options instead of using them extensively.  The few I found or could afford to purchase were happily used, and with mixed results.  I also don't find the machine gun suppressing fire option useful - better to just let them kill the units instead (and it uses less ammo).

Another oddity is the inventory system.  When a soldier is in a squad, their rifles and ammo are deducted from the total inventory.  This could have been tied to their infantry cars, where each can have a rifle, normal ammo, etc. (it even shows a gun rack in the train view) so these items need not be tied to the inventory boxcar.  Now, when a soldier is not in a squad and is idle or working on the train, his firearm, ammo and items currently are returned to the main pool until he is put back into a squad.  Sometimes, it would be nice to be able to tie a higher tier weapon to a certain character, even while he is upping his stats as a chef or engineer between missions, so I don't accidentally equip another soldier with it while he is out on an excursion.  After a while, I began to learn how to use this system, but it created a lot of confusion early on.  

When managing the train, some of the upgrades felt totally unnecessary, which is good because you never have enough material anyway.  

Fewer battles on the northern route towards the end was traded for many sick soldiers in the hospital car.  I did not appreciate this.  Other penalties, like plummeting moral or reductions in fitness/dexterity/readiness would be more realistic and make the kitchen car more useful by needing foods that counter the effects.  The cold management adds some immersion dealing with day/night temperatures - not a ""bad"" thing, but I felt I was trading wounded soldiers on the southern route for sick ones on the northern route. 

The battles on the shared portions of each route are the same, and play was not as interesting the second time around.  Only one battle I expected to see a second time was replaced by a similar story line but a totally different map.  

Conclusion:  If you are on the fence about getting this, get off and buy it, especially if it's on sale.  I know I focused on many of the less than ideal aspects of the game, but  I think THQNordic did an awesome job and deserve their 9/10 rating.  The historical perspective is fascinating.

Most of combat is looking at russian detection cones and putting your soldiers away from them. Even that is annoying as cover and concealment are poorly telegraphed. Load times are a huge bugger. Solders level up, but most abilities you get from levels have no satisfying impact, with a few game-breaking exceptions like the Critical Shot. There's no reason not to field a team of scouts, 1 grenadier and maybe 1 medic. The whole thing is boring and tedious.

But that's no problem, right? You can just set the combat difficulty to low and breeze through the boring parts!

In short, the game is worth buying, even at full price.

For those who want a fully review, spoilers ahead. (Nothing game ruining, though.)
Last Train Home can either be a fun little game, with in-depth mechanics, forcing you to strategically manage your  resources. However, here is my first complaint. Resources feel too abundant. Yes, I know they have an option to increase resource usage, but I didn't fully realize the issue until about chapter five.
I ended up having about 600~ coal and 400~ food near the end, and having enough space was the actual issue for me.
But for new players, I understand why you'd want it to be a bit easier on that front, so, for any players knowledgeable in  these sorts of games, just increase the resource usage.
Here are my positives of the game.

The story is extremely good
It's historically accurate, using a Czechoslovak bias, which works wonderfully for this game
The graphics are very nice
There are multiple languages for use
The UI never feels clunky
Decently fast at loading
good music
Took me about 39 hours to play through the entire game (so about 1$ an hour to play)
Very immersive

Negatives
Glitches show up more and more often as the game progresses ( troops walking onto rocks and unable to get down, guns appearing absolutely massive and so on)
There's this really weird late-game glitch where some of your troops will just start dying of the cold, even if they are in the train with every positive (improved winter clothes, chimney, full insulation, and yes, I made sure everything was turned on)
Can start to feel a little repetitive near the end of the game
Music plays over other music in some levels (specifically the last level, where there were three songs playing over each-other)
If you play the game stealthily, you will never run out of resources
Some levels feel unfair. There is a level where you go take a sawmill and a granary. The granary is in the way while you go to the sawmill, and if you even touch the edge of the zone, enemies will start rushing towards your position from two directions. One from the route you just came, and another for the route you must go. This leaves one route for you to go, but it just loops back to the granary. 
After this, you have to assault a machine gun position and an armoured car, along with heavy enemy support, specifically, grenadiers. This brings me smoothly to my next point.
Enemy grenadiers. They have infinite grenades. Need I say anything more?
Like I said in the glitches part, troops can just start dying randomly from freezing to death. Once I had a soldier die at full health, probably from the non-existent cold in the train. This made it so I couldn't stay in one place, or I would lose very many troops
and finally, the final mission. Vladivostok is a bit... Disappointing?  It's not all that hard, and if you help the whites, you get two soldiers. After fighting a heavy tank, you get two soldiers to help. You can also help some partisans by moving a truck to a different part of the city to hide it from red troops. But uh, half the time there were red troops patrolling the area, so it felt pointless. And taking the fortress is very easy. A grenade here, a grenade there, bait enemies into your position. 
Finally, you've taken the fortress, and the game gives you two minutes to prepare yourself. You have an anti-tank gun, a howitzer and a machine gun. Then the game says ""Ope, time to artillery barrage you!"" without warning, which is fine, but it also destroys these emplacements the game just gave you. Besides that, it's easy, I just set up landmines, and I destroyed any vehicles with either an artillery strike or grenades.

However! Before you take my negativity and decide the game is not worth the money, please remember. I played for about 40 hours, and all of the glitches and negative bits were about 30~ minutes if you were trying to pay attention to them. Otherwise, the game is wonderfully done, and I would recommend this to anyone.

Unfortunately, the demo really shows everything the game has to offer and it never evolves past the demo.

My biggest problem with the game is that everything's too shallow. After the intro, the player has a small train with nothing but a couple of passenger cars. I now have around 32 soldiers, as well as a workshop, kitchen, medical car, and artillery train. But what's actually changed? Erm... it's not really clear. Managing the train consists of assigning soldiers to roles, upgrading various train cars when the train is stationary, and sometimes selecting different crafting recipes. Things like an FTL-style 'gotta go fast' meter emerge later, as well as the cold, but they're too easy to stay ahead of. I had max insulation in every train car before the cold mechanic was even enabled.

There's also some nodes around the map which give resources, shops, and occasionally a scripted text event. These felt okay for one map, but they're a bit too formulaic and predictable to be interesting. I even found myself skipping some of them a few chapters in just because I couldn't be bothered to get the resources, and I still felt like I had an excess of supplies.

And that's pretty much it for the train layer. It sounds okay on paper, but in practice I haven't interacted with any facet of my train for an entire chapter and it's still running smoothly with an excess of resources. I don't need 8 people cooking or doing medical duties when 2-4 can handle it easily. I'm not even looking at my characters stats or levels, because increasing stat points (of which you only get 4 or 5 total, per character) give a ONE PERCENT efficiency boost. I'm not micromanaging my characters by switching roles to minmax stats, because there's not enough work for the characters to level up in other roles. It's a neat concept, but for something which encompasses 50% of playtime it just hasn't worked for me.

The tactical combat felt okay initially, but after a few missions I realised they all play out the same way. As many other reviews mention, just stack a group of snipers and you really can't lose. It's ammo/resource efficient, it takes the RNG out of combat, and it's borderline impossible for the AI to counter. Every mission is a stealth mission, so there's not much reason to take other roles outside of maybe 1 grenadier for vehicle booming. I've played 10, maybe 15 tactical missions, and the same strategy unfortunately solves all of them. There's some extremely expensive gear upgrades available to purchase, but I can't see why I would when the sniper has a 1 hit kill skill on fast recharge. 

There's also very little connection between the train and the combat phases. Soldier skills and health carry over between the two, naturally, but that's about it? The roles I've assigned on the train don't matter for the combat, the engine or cars I've acquired don't matter. All the missions are premade scenarios that you teleport to for combat, and then teleport away from afterwards. I get why it's made this way, but it ended up feeling very detached, especially as characters would regularly talk in missions despite not being there (e.g. the omniscient second-in-command).

Overall it's a bit too flawed for me to finish it. A neat concept executed in a very safe manner that didn't really offer anything new and didn't do anything particularly amazingly well.",1703867466,1703867466,False,4,0,0.511786699295043945,0,True,False,False

However after finishing the game I have to change my recommendation to a ""thumbs-down"".

The game is by no means a rip-off, it is priced fairly. But the only thing that carries this game is the scenario, because gameplay-wise it doesn't offer enough. Playing on the highest difficulty neither the tactical missions nor the strategical train management offer any challenge. In the beginning you think both things will get harder, but the opposite is true:

Tactical missions: After your soldiers level up you will find that you can just sprint across the map and shoot everybody without stealthing or even taking cover (apart from very few choke points, but you have artillery strikes for those). I've dreaded the tactical missions in the last third of the game, because even though the game creators tried to mix up the mission design, the limited gameplay makes every mission feel the same.

Strategy layer: In the beginning it is really exciting to prepare for Siberia, because you always ask yourself: Am I truly ready for the hardest stretch? That is until you realize that even on the hardest diffculty there is no survival aspect at all. If you do your tactical missions and harvest the ressource notes on the map you will have literally more ressources than your train can carry when entering siberia. My train arrived in Vladivostok with enough fuel, food, weapons and money to win the war in Europe - not once was there a dicy situation while managing the train. 


Unfortunately the game really falls short of what it could have been and comes apart after you figure out that there are very little things you truly need to consider.. I really wanted to love this game, but there just isn't enough there.",1702835058,1703862445,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So after my review you might actually want to buy it :). Note: I finished the game and had fun, it's not a bad game at all.

The general premise of the game is very, very good. Managing a train with limited resources, going through hostile territory (fighting both the weather and the enemies) is just a very good setting. If it did both better, I would completely recommend it without any doubt.

My main concerns:
1) Combat becomes trivial for two reasons: snipers are OP from level 3 and broken at level 5 and the AI is completely brain dead. To elleborate:
-- The AI has cone of vision (known from most games) and it's vbery limited cones at that. You can come straight at someone fro the side and STABBY STABBY them without response. 
-- If they do notice you., they have a 1-2 seconds delay with a question mark above their head most of the time. So if you STABBY STABBY their friend right next to them, they might notice but you can STABBY STABBY them during their confusion.
-- You trow rock around them, they go look. You kill a friend of them (that is now not in their line iof sight), they turn back and do not at all find it odd their friend is gone and a pool of blood now...
-- You can hide in 20cm grass (any class can) and lure enemies with a rock. They come close, you step forward, STABBY STABBY them and no one bats an eye, as you ARE STILL camouflaged in the 20cm grass... 
-- At later levels your snipers can run normal speed without sound, and hide in plain sight. Seriously, I know Ghilley suits are good, but you will notice them in the middle of the street pretending to be a bush... for fuck sake :).

So yeah, my main squad was 6 snipers, 2 machine gunners, 1 medic and 1 grenadier. Why even anything else then snipers? Because there *are* missions that you need to defend a location, against waves of enemies or even tanks. Then grenadiers and machine gunners are actually very useful. These missions were fun, harder and while not very challenging, not as trivial as the rest either. 

2) Train management seemed too easy. Not sure if I did something 'wrong' (ie. too well) but while the narration told me I had very little supplies, I was struggling, etc. from halfway in the game I had too little storage space... 

-- This might be partly because I could sell excess bullets (not needing them, see combat) to buy what I wanted
-- Partly because you can make infinite soup as long as you get herbs. (10 food and 10 herbs --> 20 food, repeat until out of herbs).

But at the end I needed two storage cars just to have space for all my stuff. I ended the game with 4k fuel and 1300 food... that defeated the purpose a bit ;).

The issue is, while just to major problems, each of them makes half the game less fun. If you however really like the setting and you do not mind the issues as much, I do recommend the  game. I did finish the game for a reason, it was fun, I did not hate it. Just... meh... can't recommend it with good faith either.",1703858543,1703858543,False,2,0,0.511627912521362305,0,True,False,False

The general gameplay loop itself is interesting enough but held back by a few minor criticisms:

- Scouts are incredibly powerful. The ability to see anywhere without line of sight and then to one-shot most enemies once you get them to lvl3 is huge. Then at 4 you can do that at a longer range. If I'm not in a rush it's pretty easy to clear the ""dangerous"" levels with them without taking any damage. The rest of the team is mostly there just to cover for that occasional ""oops"" moment where a patrol comes around a corner because you were lazy with the binoculars.

- While there are ideas of ""sneaking past the enemy"" to do the minimum necessary combat, the whole idea of the supply pickups completely flies in the face of it. Essentially you're making the ""survival"" aspect of the game harder if you just do the minimum to clear the objectives

- The AI is way too forgiving. They just completely ignore gunshots from quite close, so it's pretty easy to just snipe the enemy. They also have no reaction at all to bodies and they will give up looking for you nearly immediately if you just run away. You can also just set a machine gun up to target an alarm and the ai will run right into the open in its field of fire to desperately try to call for reinforcements

- Some of the above issues are not as bad in the later game where you get defence missions where you have to defend a point. Positioning helps a lot more there.

- The UI is generally fiddly. Switching on and off individual stoves was more a nuisance than anything. In the late game you get  so much coal I feel like I should've just left them on. It's also worth keeping people in squads so their gear doesn't go in storage, so you're always juggling storage unless you get an extra storage car.

- The early tuning of materials seemed pretty fine and limited, but for the last few chapters I had gradually more and more money and nothing to spend it on. I ended the game with some 70000 silver

- Sometimes the controls and visual aids are just bad... I can't tell a soldier to stay in cover, so if in fact he doesn't have visual on an enemy and I order him to attack it they will just run out of cover and get mowed down. This could be fixed by a ""stay in cover"" button, or a clear visualisation of what the soldier can see.

So overall the tactical aspects of the game are quite compromised. It's far from being a bad game, it's still enjoyable and it does reward planning and scouting so I guess that's a good thing? More missions on a timer might have spiced things up more as those were some of the more interesting ones.

I'm somewhat curious how skipping optional missions would affect later ones(if at all) and what the alternative routes would have been like, but repeating a  lot of content feels like too much a slog for the extra replay value.",1703589354,1703827281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a good bit to take in and you have to learn ""very quickly"", as in you are bombarded with new information and gameplay mechanics constantly during the first two chapters of the game, take your time, it can be dramatic in your level of success as you are playing, meaning even if you lose a mission you can still gather supplies from the map and retreat to fight another day, although there will be a tougher fight ahead or lack of future supplies in some way from success, I think I enjoy that. You can pause at any time to plan your next move. You will constantly need to keep your train moving from impending ominous threats in real time however. Scouts are essential on missions to spot threats from a distance and to understand where to setup your squad for the appropriate cover during key moments of locking down a bell tower so that no enemy soldiers can sound the alarm. Most missions actively encourage stealth, but usually only by using less ammo at the end of the mission. But there will be times where having an alarm sound has real consequences likes bringing in extra firepower from off the map like armored vehicles or a timer being activated.

You feel a sense of pride and connection to the units you read their bios and see their traits that make sense with their personalities. You build up and assign roles to each soldier on the train, each soldier can only have up to two jobs out of four on the train, but have space to support different soldier classes on the field of battle. You will need workers to upgrade and repair, engineers to drive and build, doctors to heal and prepare, cooks to lift the souls of your Brothers and Sisters in arms.

You also have classes on the field and most use different weapons with different ammo types. One thing I do recommend is everyone on board be able to shoot at slightly above average (6/10) in case you need the extra firepower for covering fire.

Negatives:

-Various small bugs and ambiguities (coal consumption mechanics are nonsese, train that is supposed to consume a lot of coal isnt really consuming a lot etc., soldiers getting stuck while moving, grenade throwing, doing critical shot)
-not balanced well - you are supposed to be forced to make hard decisions on coal and food, but even on commander level these are pretty ok and no challenge at all.
-AI of enemies - Enemies are simply retarded. OK, you wouldn't expect tactical finesse from communist horde, but I would expect human wave attacks that would challenge you (there is only a few of them) and the constant feeling of being challenged throughout the mission
-Stealth gameplay - Enemies are so stupid that even fresh corpses do not alert them. Their behaviour is predictable and small groups are easy to pick.

Let downs
- UI is lacking and could be improved a lot.
- Overall performance could be improved (it chugs a bit more during the later chapters particularly)
- There could be so much more potential for meaningful customisation to the train and the soldiers
- Takes time to get used to Czech/Slovak names. And you can't rename the soldiers either which would be fun.
- Other small bugs like events not properly loading and needing to save/reload the game to progress.

Pros:
- I'm Czech, so definitely the patriotic feel for our Legion and lots of dead Reds.
- Train management is fun, from the beginning even challenging. Later the management shifts from resources to time management, as resources become plentiful. At least most of them, if played correctly.
- Easy and intuitive controls and game mechanics. Experienced RTS player takes a grasp of the game quickly.
- Accomplishing certain missions impact later missions.

Cons:
- Unbalanced soldier skills and abilities. Some are nearly pointless, some are insta-win button.
- Dumb AI with attention span of a goldfish and hearing of a mole rat.
- Loading takes ages (and it may frustrate the player enough to stop save scumming)
- The game might be somewhat historically authentic, but is NOT historically correct. It could have been done better. I'm not talkign about gameplay mechanics, but the background, dislogues and events in the game.
- Most of the battles just felt the same, only landscape changes. It's usually isolated groups of enemies, with some 'conveniently' looking away. It needs more patrols, more scripted events, more random events, more dynamic reactions, AI flanking attempts... (see con #2)
- Pretty much no non-mission decisions that affect the game and story in the long-run, except for taking the northern or southern route. Most decisions only affect morale or resources. 
- Lots of bugs. The game should have been in the oven for a bit longer and have bit more content upon release.

Personal notes:
- I was little disappointed from lack of customisation, and skills. Medic is always stuck with a crappy pistol, unless you take medic in a soldier role and give them a healing a reviving skill. Some skills are hardly any useful and have miniscule impact to the game. Later when Avtomat Fjodorova becomes availiable, taking Medic and Grenadier (especially the Grenadier) roles becomes pointless, as Soldier can do both and with a better gun. Scout skills are way too powerful, on the other hand.
- Who and where the hell is Vlastibor Svoboda and Barbora Hlavatá in the game, and why they speak to me in the missions?
- There could have been a 'staff car' where the officers (Svoboda, Hlavatá, Langer, the player him/herself) work and live. There are cutscenes with Langer writing his notes, but no such place exist in the train. It breaks the immersion.
- On default difficulty the game is easy, I never saw and experienced the soldiers to be struggling and miserable as Langer describes in his notes.
- I expected to see (and play) more of the iconic battles, moments and deeds done by the real legionnaires.
- More forced events like train ambushes where the player has to defend the train regardless of the threat meter, more train car types would be nice, cars that were actually used, like reinforced platform cars in front of the train, even ability to have the armored car in some missions in exchange for large amount of fuel, for example.",1703775194,1703780818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game options allow you some degree of flexibility in how you'd like to approach the game with tweaking things to both the management and RTS so if you have a preference you can lean more into the difficulty of those genres. 

As a history buff the game shines a light on a relatively lesser known event so for that reason I enjoyed it, the main story is told mainly through text events and the narration of your adviser, which I must admit his VA has done a great job. Your soldiers are more X-COM than developed personalities although the traits system of both RNG and your actions/events allow a decent amount of variety within your cadre of soldiers. 

The game is not perfect, some things are a little unbalanced in favour of a player who is familiar with RTS mechanics as the ai does seem to struggle a little bit countering Stealth - but even that is a testament that you have options to play the game guns blazing and sneaking about. The UI of your squad management takes a little while to get used to but as you play and remember what soldiers you have assigned to certain roles you can get a grasp of things rather quickly. 

Overall, having just completed a first playthrough as a leisurely pace of around 30 hours, this game is worth your time. A fun mix of RTS and management, with a historical flair and a smattering of moral choices to make along the way.

And I know that there are people with modding chops out there looking at this, so this would be the ONE time where adding that in would be SOMEWHAT appropriate.

My ONLY complaint is the disconnect between story and gameplay. The STORY wants to tell a somber theme of overcoming hopeless circumstances. but the GAMEPLAY has me annihilating the WHOLE RED ARMY, platoon by platoon. You can definitely argue, ""For every one they lose, they have another THOUSAND replacements lined up."" But still, given how much ground I've covered and high-value assets I wrested, it's a bit of a wonder how this doesn't at least SLIGHTLY tip the scales of the Russian Civil War.

What makes it DIFFERENT from other strategy games is the way they implement the feeling of always moving forward. It's not a problem since your home base is mobile. It's the namesake TRAIN!

What I like:
The general gameplay - with the option to play either rambo-style or stealth style.
The soundtrack - the musical themes are variations on famous czech classical music.

What I dislike:
I thing there is too much of an incentive to play stealth-style with the scout role beign much more useful than any other role.
Occasional bugs.

What I would to be changed in the future:
Some quality of live tweaks to the UI - mostly to reduce micromanagement of repetitive tasks around the train/sending of squads to forrage...
Even though some russian trolls in denial think the story is an anti-russian propaganda, I think the reds weren't portrayed NEARLY as badly as they should have been. The experience of the legionaries were stuff of nightmares. Also - most of the countries the reds occupied for decades still remember what monsters the reds were - the developers shouldn't have hold back as much as they did... - I hope they will correct this in a dlc

Both of these series are huge favorites of mine and after playing the demo of The Last Train Home I knew it was the game for me. Moreover, within the framework of the game's processed historical period, it is an original subject - a chapter of Czechoslovak history, about which many people do not know many details (even in Czech republic). The story of the Czechoslovak legionnaires and their pilgrimage through the ravaged Russia during the First World War (or right after it) is very nicely handled within the RTS genre.
I was afraid of the management part, because I only play sporadically when it comes to management strategies (warehouses, weapons, ammunition, food, materials, etc.). Fortunately, I got into it very quickly and the principle of taking care of the soldiers and the train in general is without problems.

Summary:
+ caring for individual soldiers
+ sound effects
+ great Czech/Slovak dubbing (I didn't try English)
+ feature films/scenes
+ music
+ artworks during loading
+ overall design of the game user interface
+ weather effects, especially in the rain
+ random side missions
+ train management (wagons, locomotives, upgrades)
- sometimes soldiers get stuck on each other or some obstacle and you have to help them

The writing is very poor. The Legionaries are goody-two-shoes and the Russians (and I mean the OVERWHELMING majority) are backstabbing assholes that only seem to commit crimes against humanity for the fun of it.
There was discussion regarding Russophobia in this game, and I can honestly see where it came from. Its either that, or the writers had no idea what to do with their characters.
The Commander of the Reds is a coward and a CoH2-style parody of Order 227 who's entire character arc (there really isnt one) is wanting to murder you.
The Commander of the Whites (This is in the last mission) also wants you dead for no reason except to fulfill some orders that arent even that enforced, resulting in a White vs White combat scenario, whereas 1 minute away from the area there is a Red fortification. Like, which dev sat down and went ""Ah yes, this group of Whites will just commit treason and try to help some Czech guys hold off against other whites who will rather fight you than the Reds"". 

Really, every Russian in this game is written either as a maniac or a victim, and the victims are always random countryfolk who just want to do their farming thing. There is absolutely no nuance in any of this. The game deviates from historical events like the Legions working with the Reds at some occasions, so please dont expect an interesting historical game. This is surface-level at best if you want to learn anything about them. I will get back to the writing issues later.


Gameplay encourages save-scumming extremely, and at times you will be forced to because the game simply does not work. There is one mission halfway through where you need to defend a Gold train against an onslaught of enemies. The game gives you AT weaponry to deal against infantry blobs and vehicles. Here's the catch: the AT guns simply fire through the tanks, missing 90% of the time, meanwhile the tanks will one-shot you. So all you could do is either chuck grenades at the bloody thing while you're being overwhelmed by infantry swarms or desperately try to distract the tank, risk getting insta-killed and still fail to destroy the damn thing because your guns are missing. Late game this becomes no issue whatsoever, as you can just call in artillery strikes to one-shot the vehicles. 

The game heavily encourages stealth, however missions are so long and at times so overcrowded with enemies, you'd need to have the free time of Chris Chan to want to play them out that way (I did for about 1/4th of the game before I realized simply setting up MG zones is much more practical and saves you an insane amount of time). Also, scouts can trivialize the game if you unlock the deadzone ability, as they will outrange and devastate MG installations and infantry. 
Oh and vehicles in this game suck. They barely function as intended, miss their targets (or fire through them), are squishy, have HORRIBLE pathfinding and the list goes on. The FT-17 (light tank) is by far the most frustrating thing this game has to offer, as it will just stop driving at times because it cant figure out how to drive around the corner, and by the time its there, you're going to be a year older. 

Dialogue is extremely limited, and personality traits have next to no influence on the game because those random encounters are super rare. Doesnt matter if your soldiers are communist or nationalist, youll maybe get one tiny comment in the entire span of the game influenced by this mechanic. If anything, it just works to get you more loot in scavenging events on the map, and its just about being a hunter, burglar or housekeeper or something along those lines. Everything else does not matter. 

Soundtrack is nothing memorable and youll be hearing the same tracks play over and over again.

On normal difficulty resource management is only an issue early to mid game. I could feed my units full rations every day in the entire Siberia section, and I had around 300 food units surplus. You can do all the missions and you still will lack resources to fully or even half-fully upgrade your train though. Coal is plentiful, had about 1200 surplus, so I never had to worry about running out. Metal will be your biggest issue though. 

So yeah, while I loved the premise, the game really isnt anything special. The Frostpunk elements are lacking and I wish I got more, but the RTS was also extremely mediocre and the missions often were just dragging on for too long. The writing is very poor. Hell, there is a point where the game tries to get you to feel bad about you defeating multiple human wave charges by portraying it as a massacre, but how can you feel bad when you've done this same action multiple times before? Especially when all of your enemies are soulless monsters with massive murder-boners? Legit, there were only two ""friendly"" Red NPCs in the game, and their entire ""friendly"" bit is them willingly getting their comrades killed because they decide to surrender to you at some random station for no reason except ""we regret it and we dont like this ideology anymore"". So you go and kill everyone, and all of a sudden your soldiers are sad that they killed 30 more Russians in a minute instead of the usual 10 in self-defense (Referring to the defense segments btw). Also, your soldiers are smug about killing Reds quite often, so this just came out of nowhere. The only character development you get is your advisor Langer, and his entire schtick is developing PTSD, even though he just sits in the train all the time. 

Its just... meh. Definitely not worth the price tag. I cant really end this with anything except that it was just a mediocre experience, and the game still needs a lot of time in the oven.

PROS:

- Immersive story
- Straight fwd UI
- easy management of the train, and the squad teams


CONS:

- Music is meh

- Snipers are totally useless: Instead of being the best (?) unit and take enemies form afar they CHARGE most often than not at them, and, as a result, they get wtfpwned pretty easily, since they are useless from close range

- Medics: Their medic kits get depleted way too easily (and even though u get cloth etc from scouting missions, you cant ""transform"" them to bandages, etc). Only viable option for them to be useful, is to buy medic kits from merchants, but they are too pricey, therefore they tend to be semi-usless in battles more often than not

- Grenadiers: Same prob with the medics: The grenades are super hard to find, and they cost way too much at weapons-merchants (IF you are lucky enough to find any of them being sold to begin with)

- Rifflemen: The only good thing they have is the ""charge"" option tbh. Otherwise, they do very little dmg

- Gunners: Instead of ripping off any enemies entering their range (when having them set up in position) they are...passive, and only engage when shot at FIRST (!)...You have to actively attack an enemy within their range in order for them to be engaged in combat. Moreover, they tend to need quite some time before they set up their machine-guns, plus they are too slow to follow the rest of the team when marching (or...crawling even) within enemy lines

- Cutting by half the food rations of all troops has to be done manually for every one of them (instead of having a button-option to do that for everyone). Moreover, soldiers that receive half food-rations tend to starve almost to...death within HOURS, which is super-unrealistic, and cause extra probs too (low morale, etc)

- The only way to get extra food in the map is form...fishing (and u only get very little food from it), from merchants (if you are lucky to find some, and then it is too overpriced), and from scouting missions in various villages. In all cases your soldiers get super hungry after a while, and there is no option to at least hunt for food, or find food-cans (or whatever) at abandoned houses, and/or in villages in general

- At certain missions that you need to take control of train-stations, you dont get the option to steal at least one ""abandoned"" train-car, upon completion of the relevant mission. The only option to do that is purchasing one at certain cities, but the cost is INSANE!

- Firepower / dmg of your soldiers is ridiculously low, whereas the dmg you receive from enemy troops is unequally high. Even if you set your dmg to +150% and the enemies' to just 50%, the prob still exists

- No mods options in the game, which would have sold most (if not all) of the cons described here!

- At Ch. 3, if you have chosen the Northern-route, enemy planes tend to find/att you way too often / too easily, bc u need to make several stops at close intervals just so to resupply/check locations/fish/chop up wood. As a result your troops that rest in the train get wtfpawned/crippled and need extra med-kits/food/boosters to recover which are super-rare anyway. Its insane that you cannot hide from enemy planes even in forested areas-its the 1900s after all, and we are talking about RUSSIA and not some small country/region! Enemy scouting planes were NOT *THAT* good/efficient in rl back then, plus they were used in more important war-fronts, and not to chase down a bunch of...neutral, runaway, Chzecks on a bloody train! 

- Upon completion of each mission and/or upon scouting of any village, etc., we should be getting a decent gold payment for our trouble (and in order to be able to buy stuff from merchants, etc). Unfortunately, this happens seldom, and adds up to the whole...frustration of constantly trying to maintain a decently equipped / fed / high morale-grp of soldiers. Moreover, the fact that you receive (somehow) ""orders"" from the HQ every now and then, but NEVER any supplies and/or gold from them (through their ""messenger""), is quite ridiculous/unrealistic, too

- Coal: Its the most easy to find resource so far, compared to ammo/guns/food/med kits (when it SHOULD have been quite the OPPOSITE, tbh)

- Any tech-searching takes way too many resources (even for the first tier), and...forever to complete too.

- Unless you have a stocked up grenadier, taking down set artillery positions, is a...suicide mission, and requires pretty much your whole team. And, ofc, expect to get wtfpwned/crippled after an encounter with them too...IF the sniper units could crawl undetected and get close to them (and not only them), and/or could one-shot (?) the enemy soldier(s) operating the artillery units, our (in-game) life would be much better, plus this would have been a quite realistic option too, ofc!

- Lack of ""auto-defend"" option for each and every one of our troops: Its frustrating and quite tedious to have a large grp of soldiers to manage, and having to give orders to...attack to every one of them EVEN when they get fired upon FIRST!

- Lack of ""auto-flee battle"" when your troop's health drops, say, below 50% (or whatever). There SHOULD be such an option that would be auto-enabled, and allow the injured troop to either flee completely the battle, and/or take cover at a more fortified position nearby (and continue to fight, until we can send him some back-up, etc)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................

All of the above issues would be solved, if there was a mod-support option from the devs. Until this happens, and/or they are solved with some new DLC (?), the game is barely playable, to say the least.

It is a train after all. You have to follow the track. Left and right of the track are some POIs to visit, but it's 2 to 3 types of them that repeat with little to no variation.
The solidiers themself don't show much personality. They keep being quite shallow and replaceable.

Congratulations to Ashborne for creating such an amazing piece of art and game. 

There are of course some things I would love to see changed or improved. Firstly, the vertical fighting doesn't work well - I got into situations where enemies could shoot me from below, but my soldiers couldn't shoot down from a bridge. Next up are some little inconsistencies with breaking sneaking mode. Sometimes a stealth kill puts you out of stealth, sometimes it won't break it. Same goes with synced shots. Probably my biggest complaint would be the speed of or rather the absence of quick load. The game is sometimes very complex and I just wanna try if something works and load the game quickly if it doesn't. Loading the game takes quite some time.

Pros: 1) The train! 2) The setting is something I wasn't familiar with and it's actually astonishing what these guys had to go through.  3) You will get attached to your characters, and the leveling system is satisfying. 4) Great voice-overs. 5) Compelling gameplay loop.

Cons: 1) Not very high replay value.  I played through once, very much enjoyed it, and might come back a second time to look at some decisions I could have made differently, but that's about it.  2) Train management can get fiddly.  This is both a strength and a weakness.  My main gripe is that it can take a minute to find specific people or skills for certain missions or jobs.  3) There are a few moments of tonal discordance.  Once, I won a mission without anyone getting shot, and the next cutscene acted like half my troops had died or fallen ill.  

Neutral: 1) There were a few bugs in the first week of launch, but nothing I wasn't able to work around.  By now, these are mostly completely resolved. 2) A couple of quest lines seem to have imprecise triggers, some decisions don't always play out with satisfying results. 3) Stealth can be very satisfying, but also slightly inconsistent.  You'll just have to learn the rules around how it works through experimentation.  4) Understandably, this story is told from a standpoint of Checkslovakian nationalism - but it can seem a bit like propaganda at times (for a country that no longer exists in a conflict with factions that no longer exist)

The setting is great and the gameplay also. The tactical missions blend commandos/desperados style with Company of Heroes and it is very very fun. Figuring out how to solve the tactical puzzle and executing it correctly feels really great. And there is a looot of missions, According to devs its 40 and each can take 1-2 hours. Wow! Tactical missions are the reason for me recommending this, so if this appeals to you, go for it. Train management is fun, but for me it only acts as a glue and rest time between tactical missions.

-The bad-
I found the storytelling not very good. If you thought you will learn something about the history and life in that period like me, you will be quite disappointed. Mind that it is just INSPIRED by the history, it twists the events and sides of the conflict to suit the gameplay. If you want to know what really happened you have to read a book. Most disappointing thing for me was the simplification of sides to very good legionaries and very evil red army. And everyone opposing reds is basically on a good side. It is so black and white it is laughable. It kind of undermines the authenticity, at least for me. The reality is never like this, reality is always gray, almost never black and white.

I also have to mention that Czech dubbing felt very stiff, like people reading lines from paper. But passable.

It take interesting mechanics from popular games like Frostpunk, but implement them poorly. 
There are many games mechanics that are added very slowly one by one, until they stop trickling in and you ask yourself ""That all? Really?"", since it's only released this slow to make you think there is more to unlock and hide how empty the game actually is. But the worst offender on this front is the bloated, unskippable tutorial that even the players that have already finished the game are forced to play again, even thought they know it is a waste of time [spoiler]because of the trainwreck[/spoiler]. All of this put together mean that it will take a lot of time for players to find out how lacking this game is, way after the refund time.

There is nothing much to say about the management side. There are not many options, and many of them are simply the same generic ones for every types of wagon. While the concept of having your moving home base in the form of a train that you can upgrade and manage is very enticing, it is poorly implemented. There are fake choices that nobody will use to make you believe you have more options, but there is little that you can actually do.

The RTS side... It's incredibly unbalanced. There is no reason to use anything but a full squad of scouts once you have trained enough of them to level 3, because stealth and sniping are completely broken against the pitiful AI. A single scout can whittle down an infinite amount of enemies one at a time without wounds by simply sneaking up to sniping range, one shotting the enemy, running away to break their vision, stand still to camouflage, wait until they return to their post and repeat until they are all dead. And they will get away, since they have better movement speed than the enemy with their skill, and can't get caught unaware thanks to the binoculars.
And the cherry on top of it? You can give them skills from others classes. 
Once you understand how the pathetic AI work and how to use the scouts, the RTS side become trivial.

soldiers level up and can learn multiple combat & noncombat roles. the tutorial works fine to get you into the game.

personally i enjoyed the historical aspect and learned some things.


one of the biggest problems for me is that stealth seemed to strong. sneaking up on opponets and killing the silently, combined with a great pause function and roles perks that increase speed, lower foodstep sound etc. you often can finish whole missions with no or only few shots fired. which is good in terms of powergaming but kinda feels cheao because you brought so many guns dont use them a lot. once you get a few sharpshooter to level 3 they can 1shot any infantry with a skill on an 20 second cooldown.
the AI is not very good at handling stealth, they become alter investigate and if they dont find anything  return to their buisness ""must have been the wind"". dead bodies dissappear and dont alter anyone. so you can abuse the AI alot with stealth.

but when you ""go loud"" or shit hits the fan the actual shooting combat is very enjoyable. MG laying down loads of fire from set up positions, grenadiers hurling nades around etc.
it is actually good fun. but since every bullets is accounted for in your supply the stealth route is more effective. especially early game wehere you dont have much stuff at all. but by lategame when you have it you often still fall back on the things you've done all game, be as stealthy as possible and kill enemys in melee but have some strong shooting in reserver if shit hits the fan.


still overall still would recommend, graphics and sound are good, havent found any bugs and the core gameplay loop with a realtime (with pause) squad combat tactics game and an overall meta management game work well together and help break up any monotony.

Story and Atmosphere - 10/10
I absolutely love the atmosphere of this game and the care and attention put towards being historically authentic. It has a pretty grounded and mature story given the circumstances of the legion's trip and battle for survival against nature and human adversaries. It's no witcher 3 but it does give you choices with consequences and so on.

But by far the thing it does best, it makes you care about the humans you are bringing to the destination. The way it feeds you little narration snippets throughout both live action acting, game cutscenes and text events along your journey is done really well. You actually start caring a bit about the people you are guiding and after a while start remembering their personalities. Makes you feel like being part of the real life dash across the warring Russian countryside more than 100 years ago.

Graphics -  8.5/10
Loved the attention to detail on the train elements, and it is by no means a bad looking game. There are nice variations and detailed buildings/landmarks on the maps as well.
The only detractors are that the UI is not as good as it could be, and overall it doesn't bring anything ground-breaking in terms of graphics.

Sound - 9/10
Found nothing to complain here. The gameplay sounds are good and immersive, and the voice acting is excellent (I'm playing on the czech/slovak/russian voice and german subtitles). 

Gameplay - 8/10
The missions itself are quite fun and challenging and it can get frustrating in some places if you do not bring the right tools for the job. There is a bit of a learning curve to it, which roles are good for that situations, it definitely makes you earn it. Which I like. This ain't no company of heroes, people die super quick and a simple grenade can wipe out half of your squad, so you have to take care. 

There are still some little bit unpolished stuff like when you drive in the armoured car it's hilariously bad how it steers, and I also led to a suspension of disbelief moment where enemies can only spot it from the same range as a soldier despite being literally a metal barn on wheels. But its more hilarious than detracting from the game haha. 

The train and travelling part can get a bit boring and tedious after a while as I would like more types of locations to be able to interact with along the way. 

Verdict - almost a must-have in my collection, and hopefully it opens the door to more games like this!

Bugs: So many bugs - missing soldiers, poor path finding, random stuff exploding, missions failed explicitly, stuff refusing to be clicked and more. Figured out early I had to save often or risk wasting time on the more complex missions.

Poor optimization: Maybe it was my PC but some maps seemed poorly optimized, glitchy and resource hungry. Any map with large bodies of water was painful to play even on lowest settings

No Customization: Let us give my soldiers a nickname. Please let us re-spec soldiers in the late game.

You would think this was a negative review...

Overall a great game that was still unique and fun enough to stay interesting.

everything else is... bearable. 
Story is incredibly one-sided: No context of causes for the First world war or the causes for the revolution. Only bad Reds and good everyone else. Reds commit war crimes, kill their own people for no reason, while everyone else are all law-abiding citizens that are suffering for no reason at all. I mean... I am no fan of commies, but damn, don't you think that civil war is something that needs 2 sides to start? And in Russian civil war there were at least 3 and if you really interested - something like 5 sides. 

Oh and yes, some of your legionaries are communists. But they are completely different communists than those you are killing, so don't you dare to see humans in the soldiers you are killing. 

Maps and surroundings are not that unique. Every major city looks and feels exactly like the other, no sense of place, no sense of progress going further and further east. You will not see Red Square or at least the Three Station Square in Moscow (you know, the starting point of Trans-Siberian Railway). You will not see any other landmarks in any other city you go through. You will not meet any real historical figures, just some cartoon villains and heroes.  

Missions are ok, but they do not pose any significant challenge or offer any room for non-linear approach. Place the bomb here, shoot evil Reds there, repeat until you are fed up. 

Train mechanics... they exist. They do not really force you to make any significant decisions, they do not really add a lot of depth to the experience. Just start building extra benches as soon as you get the train in Moscow. Otherwise some people will be left behind.

The real life legion created an absurd and incredible story, and this game (with artistic liberties taken as fighting for a year in a civil war would be such a slog) does a fair job of portraying the feeling of slogging it through most of Russia, with constant obstacels in the form of local Soviets, whites or...well lets call them grannies in the wood.

There are very few bugs I ran into during my play-through, and some of them have already been addressed and fixed. The Dev team for this game are clearly invested beyond just making a game, and aiming more for creating a full experience. The most annoying bug I ran into was dead soldiers still being registered as live soldiers, losing all their morale and deserting, causing the morale of my entire train to plummet. This bug did not break the game for me as I still managed to keep morale pretty high at all times. 

The story is amazingly done, I'm not a historian, so I'm not going to comment on the authenticity of the story, but I know the game definitely nailed the WW1 vibe, allowing for a pretty immersible experience( I actually felt bad for my crew as more and more things happened). This is definitely one of its strongest feature, the story rich, roller coaster this game can put you on is worth experiencing all on its own but the combat and resource management of the game add a very good layer that keeps you engaged in real time decisions.

As a socialist myself, I found the portrayal of the Red Army as bloodthirsty psychopaths who just love killing their own civilians so hilariously divorced from reality that it was hardly even offensive. Meanwhile the White Army is portrayed as desperate but noble patriots. Reminder, the White Army was fighting for the Czars who had essentially enslaved ~38% of their entire population to enrich their royal family and enable their decadent lifestyles. To the extent that such a thing existed, the White Army was certainly NOT the good guys. There’s also quite a bit of confusing Slavic ethnocentrism that doesn’t play well outside central and eastern Europe. Hey dudes, if you’re going to sell your game on the international market, maybe tone that shit down, the rest of us think it’s hella weird.

Moving on from all that, the gameplay itself is excellent. It’s half base management sim, half tactical pseudo Realtime RTS, where your base is a train that’s constantly on the move. The gameplay loop consists of scrounging for resources from various sources nearby your train to keep the train moving, your troops warm and fed, and get precious materials for upgrades, and then fighting small squad based objective missions against enemies, usually the Red Army. The missions are very well designed, with multiple avenues for flanking and terrain for exploitation. Your soldiers level up in between missions and unlock powerful abilities that would feel almost broken if the game didn’t occasionally throw unfair numbers of enemies at you. 
My only gameplay related complaint is that the game pretty much shows its entire hand within the first two chapters. After the first few hours of the game, you’ve pretty much seen everything the game has to throw at you in the missions. Most RTS campaigns trickle out new units and scenarios to keep things fresh, which would have helped keep things feeling novel. Similarly, the PoI scavenging opportunities only change once, and not in a significantly material way. You do eventually have to deal with the cold, which is a good and interesting gameplay twist.

Overall, I recommend this game for fans of the genre, and fans of history that can take the game’s blatant propaganda with a grain of salt. I would not blame you for not being able to shut your brain off and enjoy the game for what it is, but if you can, the gameplay here is truly unique and interesting. I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on what this studio does in the future.

1469610,153751815,76561197981216472,0,6,2181,0,1552,1703137890,"I was expecting an old school style overworld game where you watch the train from the overworld and then go into levels for the RTS combat (like super mario world or something but with rts levels), but this game is actually so much more than that.

Its more like Oregon Trail x Company of heroes, but 75% management sim and 25% RTS. its not what I was expecting, but I love it ALL THE MORE for that reason. 

Last Train Home takes place during the Russian civil war right after World War 1, you are playing as the commander of a Czech legion that is neutral to the post war Russian factions and just trying to get out alive.

The game runs on Unreal 4 and has a GORGEOUS old school style overworld, but then you can scroll in and YOUR TRAIN IS MOVING THROUGH AN ACTUAL WORLD! Its from this point of view that you make upgrades to your train, manage your crew, and divide your legionaries into squads to make supply runs. 

The game is all about resource management. You must keep your troops fed, supplied, healthy, and even happy. You have to account for everything from what small arms they are using, ammo count, their shifts, and even keeping them properly clothed during the winter. You also manage the train itself, you can add cars throughout the game such as hospital cars and engineering cars. You even upgrade the cars themselves, making them more comfortable for the troops so they can rest up quicker, more durable, and making the train more efficient and safe. 

This all seemed like a ton to take on at first, but the game is pretty good about slowly ramping up the difficulty and amount of responsibility that you take on. The menus are all very easily navigable. You get little warning icons when someone is overworked or unhealthy, and clicking on them shows you exactly who. Clicking on a soldier, for example, from almost any of the different menus, will give you their stat page, perks, ailments, and a consumables button if you need to make them better on the fly. Most of the icons for their traits and ailments are pretty well labeled and help you to understand the mechanics of the game.

Troops have train roles like conducting, cooking, healing, and raw labor for building upgrades and stoking the train. Each legionary has their own individual stats and perks, for example a trooper needs 5 intelligence to be a doctor or engineer, but you can also make a doctor or engineer have a second role as a combat troop if they meet the stat requirements. Each trooper levels up individually and can have both combat and train roles.  The combat roles are scout, medic, grenadier, machine gunner, and rifleman. Troops also have their own perks that give them unique buffs or nerfs in battle, affect how they act when they meet potential adversaries, make them better at finding resources on supply runs, or are just straight up quirks like alcoholism or poor impulse control. 

The RTS missions are a game of playing angles and using cover. Troops don't really get hit behind cover so you must push up units to flank or bayonet enemies behind cover, or you can use grenades to attack from unseen angles, or just call in artillery from the train. You can also play stealthy and try to thin enemy numbers before an engagement, which you should because ammo and medical supplies come straight from your stash so you'll have to craft, loot, or buy more. Your troops can also permanently die (but they go to a downed state first), and you get a game over if you reach less than 6 legionaries. You could always save scum, but if you are poor at managing your troops or too reckless on missions you could dig a deeper and deeper hole throughout the game, prolonging a losing battle.

The enemy AI I wish was a little smarter, they will try to outflank and push up on you as well, but if you move your troops completely out of range they will kind of just dart straight at you in the open like they have a death wish. At the very least, this isn't out of character for Russian military, whether we are talking Napolean Era or 2023, lol.

There's also some story stuff where you read whats happening to your troops and what they are encountering as they roam the lands of Russia and the politics of trying to stay a neutral faction but constantly being faced with hard ethical decisions. I don't really know how deep this goes because I'm still pretty early in the game but I assume there's some branching outcomes for your campaign.

The game is LONG, as of now I've probably put like 10-15 hours into it so far (I tend to rack up some afk menu/pause hours) and I estimate based on the world map that I'm not even a third of the way through it yet, so if the game is appealing to you, its probably worth a buy even at full price. I think the game is an absolute gem, with how deep some of the management sim stuff goes, the setting and graphics, and the reasonably solid RTS side of it. I absolutely recommend it.",1702771313,1702771614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But a few things that felt off: 

- Red catoonish evil, white good to neutral, Legions are angels ... yeah, sometimes really killed the immersion. I mean, this game spotlights a part of history unknown to me, would be nice if there would be more shades between black and white
- The hunt for ressources during combats is distracting to say at least. What? Civilians being murdered? Sure I will help, let me just quickly pack those sacks of coal
- Once you have learned that the game wants you to be stealthy, you win every mission with a few snipers and a grenadier. Add a medic if you are feeling uncomfortable.
- Ended the game on the ""Commander"" difficulty with 3.000 coal and 500 food in stock on the first run till Wladiwostok. Did it take me 30 hours and did I finish almost every side mission? Certainly. Was it worth it? Apperently not. Why do I mention it? Because it is the driving part of the story through the whole game. ""Ooooh. We are so short of coal! We need to clear out a coal mine to proceed ..."" and then you look into your stock and be like: Yeah ... no.

If you have played Frostpunk or other games where ressources have to be spared and hard decisions to be made, this game might surprise you as rather easy.

But these are the only few points ... overall the game has a very fresh taste and we should support the devs for realeasing a brave new game in a good, solid way.",1702769756,1702769880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A train of hope, through strife and dread,
Bound for a home, where dreams were bred.

In the vast expanse of Russia's strife,
A civil war's tumult, a precarious life.
Bolshevik shadows, whispers in the breeze,
Yet Czech hearts brimmed with steadfast ease.

On the iron veins of the Trans-Siberian track,
A skirmish danced, as courage pushed them back.
Soldiers of freedom, a beacon so bright,
Rescuing souls from the cruel night.

Amidst the snow, 'neath a somber sky,
They stood as guardians, with courage high.
A brotherhood forged in the crucible of war,
Against the Bolshevik tempest, they'd soar.

Vladivostok awaited, a distant shore,
A respite from battles, a haven to explore.
Through trials profound, losses untold,
Their spirit unwavering, their story unfolds.

The port beckoned with whispers of home,
A haven for wanderers, no longer to roam.
A ship awaited, on waves it would sway,
Heralding the dawn of a brighter day.

Yet, hardship persisted, shadows remained,
The sea bore witness to sorrow unstained.
Comrades remembered, a melancholy toll,
In the wake of sacrifice, a bittersweet scroll.

Homeward bound, on the open sea,
Through azure waves, a journey to be free.
Memories etched in the heart's sacred tome,
As Czech soldiers sailed towards the horizon's dome.

Of soldiers untamed, beneath the midnight sun.

All good things. But by the 4th and 5th chapter you're kinda like ""what the fuck?

First playthrough done and i enjoyed it very much. The cutscenes are imerse and beautiful and the storyline is captivationg. The gameplay of both managing the train and the battles feel thought through and balanced.

For the devs i think there is some room for improvement on the in battle AI, atleast for players wanting a higer difficulty. Engaging in all out combat the AI behaves as it should but managing a mission in stealth mode is a bit too easy with a maxed out scout or two. Apects like enemy suspicion levels increasing or having to remove enemy bodies to avoid detection would make the choice of stealt or a limited engagement harder to make thus making (in my opinion) the gameplay more intresting after progressing a few chapters.

This however is not something that lowers my overall score for this game. I am impressed and will for sure give another campain a go after letting it rest for a bit.

There's a nice management part where you have to keep your train and everyone on it alive. This involves stopping at POI's to gather food and resources, which you can use for upgrading your carriages and crafting/researching new stuff for your army. There's great storytelling wrapped around your journey; you'll often meet new people with interesting stories or tasks for you to perform.

The combat missions are in real-time, and you can create your own squads with scouts, riflemen, machinegunners, grenadiers and medics. The combat mechanics are rather basic, but the missions are very well designed and have a decent variety of objectives. Your soldiers earn XP during the missions, which you can use to upgrade their stats. When your soldiers level up, they gain access to new techniques, like smoke grenades for your grenadiers.

There's lot of content in this game, it will take you somewhere between 20 and 40 hours to complete, depending on the difficulty and how many side missions you want to complete. Gathering resources can become slightly repetitive in the middle of the game, but the survival aspect shines when you reach the ice cold plains of Syberia.

Last but not least, the game looks and sounds great. The environments are rich on detail, voice acting is in native languages and there are some well-made FMV cutscenes between the chapters.

for one, its a stealth game moreso than an actual tactical game. yet the stealth mechanics feel a bit clunky and off, yet also somehow at the same time sometimes absurdly abusable.
A hilarious example is the fact the russian soldiers are just so so bad. i understand you can only make an AI so 'smart' both practically, and for gameplay purposes, but when you can wipe out an entire squad of 8 guys because you keep poking out of a bush, stabbing a dude, then running back in before they got from ? to !, and then just casually walk out and stab another guy in the back, and keep repeating, is just... hilarious, but also just silly.

another bad example is enemy pathing. the patrols, especially the vehicles, can often be seen struggling to properly turn around at the end of the route, often making their path weird. This once resulted in me nearly losing a guy, but luckily i happened to just go over and look at my scout at exactly the right moment. after multiple, like 5-8 passes by the enemy squad, suddenly they were cutting so close to a fence my guy in the bushes on the other side did his auto stab they do to anyone near them, causing the other 5 guys to jump the fence to look for him. thankfully, there was juuust enough bush Left to move him away and avoid him stabbing anyone else and pulling them too close, but it was still a situation on multiple levels that shouldn't of even happened in the first place. 

the combat also just feels way too clunky. anytime you end up needing or just end up in a fight, its just... not fun. nothing feels smooth or intuitive, and it just feels frustrating and way too random at times. just after multiple fights, nothing feels reliable, and it just can be hard to understand what or how the game actually expects you to play the game. sometimes theres just clearly no way to wholly stealth an area without some level of a firefight, but your options in a firefight just feel absurd to take too. 

really, its just hard to put into words, and i could probably do a way more proper way of explaining my thoughts on it, but i guess it just boils down to feel like the elements dont feel like they fit together; doesn't feel enough like a stealth game, a combat game, or a 'hero' game (aka meant not to lose troops). it desperately needs to remove one of the three elements and work to mesh the other two together better.",1702524833,1702524833,False,4,0,0.499023646116256714,0,True,False,False

  While not historicaly accurate, Last Train Home has an interesting story to tell.  Narration progresses via interactions with the Trans-Siberian railway stations, often resulting in side missions. Campaign map is beautiful and vast. Mission maps provide lots of diverse cover and concealment. Line of sight is an important game mechanic.
  Game itself is not too difficult. Some maps can be cleared with 1-3 man teams specialized in stealth (and blatant overuse of bushes). AI could be more aggresive and sometimes lob a grenade there preemptively, if said bush is under suspicion. 
  Resource management is another important task, especially in the early game. Resources stop being an issue from midlle to late game (if You are completionist lootgoblin like me). End game is more about where the hell should I sell all the spoils.

The management layer is simple and initially interesting, but does not meaningfully increase in depth or complexity over time, while UI issues make it increasingly cumbersome as you get further into the story. For example, the job slot selection UI only shows 4 potential workers at a time, while your roster can grow to over 30 in the mid-late game, with a dozen train job positions that constantly need assignment and re-assignment based on the situation. Meanwhile, the tactical layer suffers from almost non-existent enemy AI, which is only capable of moving along simple patrol paths, responding to noise, or (rarely) following a clearly scripted path during events. This means that as the game progresses, the only way that difficulty increases is through larger numbers and higher stats. While hostiles do have classes and skills, you will never see these in use unless you make a mistake, and their impact is often minimal.

Most concerning, the game has received no patches since launch ~2 weeks ago, and still has quite a number of bugs. From cover positions that can't actually be taken, to mission objectives that trigger at incorrect times, to hostile patrols that can spawn in and shoot you from outside of the map, the game can be quite frustrating with inflicting 'undeserved' losses. This is made much worse by the decision to not allow mid-mission saves.

Typical 8 go this way, two decide to go opposite route, right through the machine gun nests, dogs and artillery, causing alarms and SOS, death and map wipe -- so you know, pay attention to white lines.

In short, this game is a cautious recommendation.

On the positive side - the story is captivating, detailing parts of (the aftermath of) WW1 that gets little attention in most of Europe, let alone across the pond.
Train, resource management and event handling is fun, albeit a bit basic.
There's enough difference in possible routes & choices to warrant a possible 2nd run through and even a single run will net you, depending on how much you like to take your time during missions, a couple dozen hours of entertainment at the least.
The combat doesn't overstay its welcome - the missions and associated objectives give enough to do without becoming a drag.
Did I mention the story?

This however is marred by a couple of negative points that bring the whole experience down a bit.

First off: The game suffers from both major and minor bugs. Soldiers placed in train jobs via autoassign may be permanently lost without due cause between chapters (Seriously, until fixed dont use autoassign!). Resource gatherings may fail to result in a, well, result (in essence wasting the node) or be unclickable until repeatedly revisited. Some maps bug out when saving and/or loading mid-mission - failing to progress their objectives and forcing a redo of the entire mission.
The enemy AI occasionally spazzes out - rubberbanding units between patrols, failing to move when shot (vehicles, mostly) or just AFKing out of bounds somewhere.
Pathfinding is also occasionally rough, with units getting stuck in clumps of trees or a bunch of rocks. forcing you to manually walk them back and around the obstacle. Most of these gripes range from ""annoying but manageable"" to ""Well, that's the end of this run"".
Oh, and my personal favorite: I got a combat mission but it gave me some morale penalties for religious legionaries for accepting - but I forgot how many units were recommended so clicked cancel when the mission popped up. Upon redoing the entire text I got ANOTHER set of morale penalties for that bunch of legionaries that were opposed to the mission. For funsies I kept going out of that mission and reopening it and tanked their morale to 0 - then reloaded my save of course.

Additionally, the vast majority of your choices don't seem to matter beyond what happens during the event they appear in. Give a large amount of ammo to the Whites in an event? Never comes up again. Give extra cloth to a raided airfield for repairs? Never comes up again. Give a bunch of food to desperate people? Never comes up again. And so on, and so forth. If it doesn't lead into something during the event it happens in then odds are very good you're never going to hear anything about it ever again. Which is a shame. Only in the last chapter do some effects carryover to the final battle but even there it's all relatively minor. I really would have liked more ...anything? to have happened from my choices. Help people out a lot and get helped in return, be selfish and unhelpful and get left on your own etc. But if it happens to have effects I've not noticed  it.

Third and final: The combat is unfortunately pretty basic. There's ways to game the system and fullclear every map safely and then there's the ""firefight in the streets"" method that costs you heaps of supplies. Essentially you're pigeonholed into ""gaming the system"" by having a bunch of scouts instagibbing entire patrols from half a map away while stealthed - or you trade ineffective fire and waste half your ammo stockpile and all your consumables each fight. Which means either always being low on ammo, or having to buy a 2nd storage cart to carry your 20.000 unspent MG and handgun ammo around that you never really get to use anyway. It doesn't overstay its welcome - but it's certainly not something that carries this game to the next level.

Anyway - in summary: Excellent story & resource management game with ""ehh"" Real-time with pause combat spread over missions that are spaced just far apart enough to not become chores. Yet unfortunately held back from being a 100% recommend because of both minor and major bugs, abovementioned ""ehh"" combat mechanics and an unfortunate lack of consequences of the taken actions, making events more ""Do I want to take/lose X items"" and less ""do I really want to do X action? What'll it mean later?""",1702322790,1702322877,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Finished my first playthrough after 20 hours and I was blown away. This is the best game I have played that combines ressource management with RTS. 

The normal difficulty was a bit to easy for me since I rarely lost soldiers throughout my playthrough but with very detailed difficulty options you can turn this journey through the Russian winter into the torture it was meant to be.

The RTS part is not great but it was good enough for me. The enemy suffers from stupidity and the variety of weapons is a bit lacking. You get into a rock-paper-scissors type strategy where you need a certain class of soldier to counter another. It would also have been great to get a few more classes, for example a stealth class, to incentivize diffferent approaches to gameplay. At a certain point I just started taking more soldiers than the recommended amount to avoid having to play a stealthy approach. Which was possible since ammunition is quite cheap in the game and I only ran out of rifle ammo 15 hours into my playthrough.

Tldr: More weapons, more classes, more battles.

Ressource and train management are very good and thought out. In general I just wished some upgrades would have been cheaper (Workshop, Kitchen, Hospital) since I barely upgraded anything that wasnt related to heating. 20 hours is a good timeframe for a campaign but if you put a lot of thought into the train management side I just wished I could have used it to its full potential. 

Overall this is a great game worth its price.

You play as a commander of Czechoslovak legion's train. Your task is the get through the russia to Vladivostok on armored train while carring about your troops and managing your limited supplies. While the exact story and characters are fictional, the legion and their journey is real.

I have finished the game on ""commander difficulty"" (the highest default difficulty), it took me around 30-34 hours and that was because I was carful during missions and I took all optional missions as well, but it can be finished a little bit faster (So for me as the buy-at-launch guy I got 1 hour per € spent). The game has a little bit of replaybility (you can choose other options like different route for your train) but mostly you will play the whole game like 2-3 times (at least for now).

 The game is highly imerssive, combination of soundtrack, artstyle and characters really makes you think that you are there. Your soldiers are not just *random gunner #2511* like in some other games but every one of them is written like a living person, everyone has a backstory why they joined the legion, everyone has a character trait, a nature, specific skills etc.

Gameplay explained:
The game has two major parts, overworld train management and combat mission. 
During the ""train time"" you send different squads to many points of interest (different PoI may require different skills and therefore different soldiers) along side the train track, you manage your resources, you can upgrade your train or buy new train cars in depos, later you can craft some resources. You have to combat the weather and problems like track blockages. You also have to keep your eye on your soldiers, make sure they are healthy and have good morale (soldier can desert when the have too low morale), most of your soldiers have both combat role and train role, everyone in the legion has to be usefull. You manage your crew on train in two shifts (day and night), someone has to drive and stoke the locomotive, someone can make more ammo, someone can treat the sick and wounded etc. Both types of roles can level up and your soldiers can have more thatn one of each role (for example you can have a soldier who is either rifleman or medic in combat and worker or doctor in train).
When you get into combat event you can take up to 10 soldiers to fight, there are 5 combat roles with different weapons and abilities. Every soldier has a limited ammo/item capacity for a mission. Combat is in real time with option to stop it at will to give new orders or plan your next move. There is basic cover system and stealth system. 
Criticism:
One of its strenght is also its weakness and thats the unique mix of genres, it is an interesting mix but it came with the cost of depth. There are many interesting mechanics and gameplay options but its all so shallow, stealth is really basic and it lacks few QoL things, same for management system or the combat. Its really good you just wish for more. 
There are also some smaller bugs. The carry capacity upgrades just doesn't work, you research them, you have them for like one session and after you close and start again the game you are locked back to old capacity. Once I got softlocked in optional missions because triggers didn't properly triggered and I was stuck with ""talk to civilians"" objectives after I already talk with them and there was no way to undo it other than reload before the trigger.
Pathfinding can be a littlebit sketchy at times, sometimes my soldiers got stuck on random obstacle and enemy patrols tend to get scattered because individual members has to pass invisible checkpoints to continue.
UI can be messy at times (mostly during train sections), there are some filters for your crew but you lack some important one (Like filter soldiers based on their skills. For example you want to go hunting and need to find your hunter, you better remember his role because there is no ther way to filter out hunters or any other skill.).

Final thoughts:
I really like the game and I hope the devs will iprove it in the future with some QoL elements like better filters or some mechanics for stealth (I am really missing the ""eye button"" from commandos wich showed you when enemies had a vision on target location etc.) or more events.",1702307485,1702307485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I will say this all the units in the game are useless except for the sniper. 

You can literally go through the campaign using only snipers...
1 or 2 missions I've used a grenadier and a medic but honestly I could of done those missions without them they would of just taken a bit longer and required a bit more care on my part.

The camouflage and insta kill is a broken combo and only gets more broken when your snipers hit level 5 and get the ghost passive where they can run silent. 

3 to 5 snipers is enough to take out a whole squad of up to 7 people before they even get their guns up. 

Stealth insta kill 5 then shoot remaining 2. 
Tips to thrive with snipers.
Dismantle all other ammo besides rifle ammo so much extra metal. Sell off gunpowder never needed to make more ammo or buy any ammo.. Sell all guns (except snipers) and consumables except for stims and 5 or so med kits/first aid for the odd random event emergency.

Don't waste time with the artillery car. It's cool but honestly if you just want to thrive go sniper instakill combo.

 Additionally, the overmap for inventory and resource management, even if it is clunky. The armored train is fun to work on, upgrade and maintain. Lots of options, and getting a new rail car feels awesome 'cause it dramatically expands your abilities.

Also, the story is pretty decent. 

Also an RTS, which are rare these days.

Cons: Playing. This game is very, very janky. Starting with stealth. 

Stealth is there, and there is basic stealth mechanics. You go into ""silent mode"" (stealth), and then creep around, going into bushes and cover to block sight with your soldiers. However, to see enemy vision, and plan your approach, you must mouse over an enemy. Not a bad system, but the controls are super jank and you must pause, then come out of pause, to effectively change targets. In addition, there's a delay between you ordering and your characters acting. Something like a third to a quarter of a second. Enough for your characters to fuck up the order, especially if someone comes into vision all of a sudden. But what about classes designed to take advantage of this?

All the relevant abilities are locked at high tier. For example, the Scout's distract ability is key to any successful stealth attempts and is arguably the single best ability in the game, but it's unlocked at level three. A base scout then, isn't that useful, even if he can remove parts of the fog of war. This is complicated by the system of perma death and tight supplies, which means often stealth is the best way to deal with enemies so you don't lose characters, but, due to needing to level up your characters, and needing to not expose them to unnecessary danger, it means that if you want to play well, the game becomes a complete, TIME CONSUMING SLOG. Not kidding, some of these missions can last an hour. Shit gets boring real fast.

But you can fight! Right? Yes, and it's a terrible idea. You will likely expend more munitions that you can gather if you get into several fights on mission, so you either stealth (see previous problem), or, you avoid the soldiers. Avoidance is not a bad idea, but the (enemies) wander about and there is no way to see their patterns, not even get intel on their routes, so you will often bump into them at random. Not to mention that the enemies are fucking crack shots and somehow WAY faster than your guys! Like, the Reds can just run down your troops. No sweat. It's stupid how accurate and tough they are. Literally no room for error.

Lastly, there are cool items and power ups on the map, like armored cars and tanks. But guess what? They get melted by enemies, because your characters use their guns so slowly, and and the enemies almost never miss! Even regular rifles chip down your metal pretty fast, even on tanks, TANKS, which really defeats the purpose of them. Your almost better ignoring them on most maps.

THere's so many other small things that piss me off, but you get the point. The core mechancis are not tight, not responsive, and hard to manage. If your going to get this game, play on easy mode. You'll get a chance to enjoy the game for what it is. As much as I want to love this game, I can't, because it's not a good game.

You probably saw this and thought ""Hang on. Is this Frostpunk on a train? That sounds awesome!"", then you're right! It sounds awesome, but that's not what this is.
But is it still good?
[b]Yes.[/b]

[h1]What Is This?[/h1]
Last Train Home is a freezing and wartorn tale of the military unit of a newly formed nation desperately trying to get home through a foreign country embroiled in a civil war. As your train rolls along the rails of an increasingly frigid and hostile landscape, you will have to forage for supplies in ruins of villages, trade with locals, and do as much as you can to ensure that your supplies will last you the length of your journey.

If only things were that simple. Your resources aren't just food for your soldiers and coal for your locomotive, it's also bullets, first aid kits, medical supplies, and weaponry as your now former allies are eyeing you with increasing suspicion and you need to defend yourself as well as fight to break through blockades and take strategic objectives for precious supplies.

[h1]Focus and Gameplay[/h1]
[h2]Squad Combat[/h2]
This game's largest action focus lies in the squad level combat of the missions. You will put together your squad on the train and send them on missions where you will be granted individual control of them. Your soldiers will get individual abilities, both passive and active, based on their Combat Role(s) that you can equip them with, weaponry, and various items, and it is up to you to make sure that they are used to the fullest.

[h3]Stealth, Cover, and Survival[/h3]
You are a single unit against an entire army. You need to be smart about it to live through your deployments. For this, you can employ the basic stealth system. Your soldiers will find themselves in either Loud or Quiet mode. In Loud they will fire on anything that's in range, always be visible to enemies who can see them, and move at full speed. In Quiet, they will not fire unless [i]directly[/i] fired upon, move more slowly, but be able to hide in bushes, tress, and other similar tall grass. If ordered to attack, they will attempt to sneak (in a beeline) towards the target and stealthkill them in one hit (this still produces some noise so nearby enemies might get suspicious).

Outside of not getting seen, your next best bet is not getting hit. For this, cover is vital. Unless you can take out the enemy soldiers before they get a chance to really fire back, you need your soldiers to be in cover or you [u]will[/u] get hit. Thankfully, cover is neatly marked when hovering your cursor near it (and your units automatically snap their movement to it if it's marked), and if paused (called Tactical View) [i]all[/i] cover is shown in your vision.

[h2]Rails and Trails[/h2]
Between missions, you will manage your soldiers on board the train, assigning them work positions, their squad designations, and the train's various upgrades and cars. Alongside this, you will be sending out squads towards various Points of Interest on the map. Perhaps an abandoned village where you can attempt to gather building materials, forests where you can forage for food, and towns where you can trade for various materials, and potentially even weapons and ammunition. Your soldiers have various traits that can effect the outcomes at these PoI's, so you need to do your best to put together the most appropriate squads for these tasks.

This is also where the majority of the decision making is made in the narrative, whether to accept missions from the people who approach you, either from soldiers from one side or the other of the civil war, partisan fighters, or simple civilians in need of aid; donate supplies to starving parishes; or, as is worryingly common, ram through blockades or remove them. Can your locomotive, your only means of transport and source of safety in this desolate wasteland of snow and ice, take the battering, or do you choose to waste precious hours, time you don't know if you can spare, alongside the risk of your position being spotted and coming under attack, to simply dismantle it?

[h1]Light Snow and Avalanches[/h1]
As a game that is two games alongside each other (one part squad strategy, one part resource management), you will find that the game has, effectively 4 difficulty settings. There's the classic Easy/Hard modes, but there's also Commander and Quartermaster. I am not good at strategy, however much I'd like to be, but I'm confident in my skill to manage limited resources and tight deadlines, so I played on Quartermaster, where the difficulty for the squad strategy was on Easy, and the difficulty for resource management was on Hard. This was a welcome affair as I was fairly certain I could manage one half of the game on full whack, but not the other. I still found the Hard resource management a bit on the easier side of things, but as with all things like this in life, your mileage may vary. Play on the one you find the most appealing. Of course, if you want a fully custom experience, you can also tweak individual parts of the difficulty settings.

[h1]Insubordinance and Disciplinary Action[/h1]
Is this game without flaws? Of course not, games rarely are. The pathfinding for your people can sometimes get stuck, sometimes it can be hard to tell if beaning some guy with the butt of your rifle will alert his buddy, the icon for ""your soldier will take cover"" takes priority over ""your soldier will be able to hide here"", no matter if they're in Quiet or Loud, and the game DOES NOT autosave during missions (but it does when you're on the train) and if you want to restart the mission, you start all the way from forming the squad (which is fair), and makes you go through all of the dialogue and the intro cutscene for the mission (which can be skipped, thankfully). The quicksave key is F5 as per standard, by the way. Use it as you please. 

On top of that, it can be hard to tell what your people can and cannot see in terms of firing lines and you won't know until you stare at them [i]not[/i] firing at an enemy. Thankfully, Line of Sight tends to work both ways in this case. Also, sometimes, if you command some people to move one by one to get them into that [i]perfect[/i] cover position, you might end up with two people on top of each other in the same spot, one soldier icon covering the other. Which means you won't notice that only one of them is in cover while the other gleefully takes bullets to the vitals, unless you know to look for it.

Is all of this a dealbreaker? No, not in the slightest. Most of my reloads came from my own idiocy (when you tell someone to plant a bomb, remember to tell them to then [b]get away[/b] from the bomb), and only rarely from dodgy pathfinding meaning my soldier walked into a sight cone or not getting out of the radius of a grenade in time.

[h1]Coming Home[/h1]
Overall, I'd recommend it. If you're longing for Frostpunk, I'd say go play Frostpunk, if you're longing for Company of Heroes, go play Company of Heroes.

The soundtrack is suiting, the voice acting is great, the major story cutscenes is majority muhfugging FMV which is a huge plus in my book, and while the names might be a bit hard to remember for some (like me), you do eventually form a bond with them over the missions and the time spent taking care of them on the train.",1702252072,1702252072,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Train management and specialisations comes down to a numbers game. More people means you have your train guys, and you have your explorers/fighters. So it's quite tedious at the start and semi redundant in Act 2 onwards. There are no rare characteristics that lock certain skills, it all comes down to gathering enough materials to unlock the ability to do more things with your staff on the train.

After restarting 4/5 times I haven't noticed much variance in characteristics through Act 1 or 2 of the soldiers you pick up. The names are all the same which is fine but the characteristics average out.

I don't find the combat particularly fun. It's quite tedious setting up ambushes which is basically how they encourage you to play with an ever increasing sheer number of enemies. You pick off the outskirts, mostly using timing of placing troops into areas they are hidden and then attacking all at once to overwhelm them. any other way you get dragged into an ineffectual gunfight and take injuries. Which is realistic so fair enough. Bayonet charges just don't work with more than 1/2 enemies in the same area. Troops also stand in the open under fire unless specifically told to regain cover. Which is fine but also kind of annoying.

Gathering is hit and miss which is fine but also you rarely hit the motherload on anything so on Act 3 which i'm currently completing the best strategy is just to plough through as I amassed a large store of fuel in the previous chapter. This is realistic based on what's happening at the time but i'm basically being encouraged to disregard about 20 different locations which isn't that fun as this chapter is just a rolling series of combat scenarios.

I think they could do with finding a lot more variance. It should be fun enough to play without the story driving it, imo.

I love survival managements games like this, the overall feel and game play is enjoyable and the fact there is actual combat THQ NORDIC style is in this game is a solid bonus. The game time is pretty good as at 40 hours I'm maybe 3/4th's through the game with every mission being hand crafted as far as I can tell so you will definitely get your moneys worth out of this title and in my case I keep telling myself ""Just one more station.""

One thing I would recommend or suggest is don't go full stealth in this game as while it is fun and gratifying to do a full ghost run on a mission it is the easy mode. Unfortunately the stealth in this game is not great, its to the point to you can call in an artillery strike on an enemy squad, leave one survivor and not 3 seconds later they go ""Must be the wind"" and continue their patrol. This also leads to gathering absurd amounts of spare ammunition clogging up your cargo.

Now for the asterisk: This game is very Anti-War and borderline Czechoslovakia-Legion propaganda where your merry band are not a bunch of murder hobo's trying to leave a country they don't care for and want to go fight for their actual country but are instead a jolly group of goody-two-shoes who gasp in horror at all the atrocities around them while helping little old ladies cross the street.

The story and your actions/accomplishments do not line up so my Immersion kept getting thwacked with an iron pan every so often and sometimes I genuinely feel like the story-writer and the game devs had little to no communication with each other. An example being at first the game harps on about being neutral and its a mystery on why the Red Army is hostile towards you when you in-game are actively assaulting their facilities, even in the mission briefing to screw them over, killing their men and looting/destroying their supplies.

Camouflage shouldnt give them the ability to stand out on a road and KO a enemy that has walked that path and doesnt notice theres suddenly a bush where there never was before. Missions also tend to take the better part of an hour, which is fine, but the game is so addicting I end up playing till 3 A.M. With most of the negatives out of the way, I loved everything else. Sending out squads to explore locations, managing resources (although I was never really even close to having a problem with food or coal, didnt ever need to set a soldiers rations to half, playing on recommended difficulty), upgrading the train, saying screw it to stealth mode and letting the enemy wander into death zones were all fun. All in all, needs a little patching up, but otherwise, good game, highly recommend.",1702173073,1702173073,True,10,0,0.609269320964813232,1,True,False,False

This game checks them all
Lead a division of Czechoslovak Legionaries along the length of the Trans-Siberian railway at the height of the Russian Civil War, partaking in battles to protect your train as well as persecuted civilians
The battles have parts that come from Company of Heroes as well as XCOM
Pause the battle to issue multiple commands before you un-pause and watch your soldiers carry out your orders
Outside the tactical battles there is the Frostpunk-esque management where you look after the train and keep your soldiers healthy while you battle against the harsh weather of Siberia and keep the Reds from attacking
The difficulty is just right; it features four preset options but the sliders can be changed to tailor the difficulty just how you want it.
Do you want a hardcore fight where the challenge is nigh-on impossible?
Or an easy run to enjoy the story?

It's just not a game I enjoy.
Despite being an RTS game it doesn't feel like one because the combat is kinda slow and mostly relies on the special abilities of your units.
The crew management just feels tedious, even on lower difficulties.
The UI is not intuitive and all over the place.

This is probably a really god game if you like to micro manage every aspect of your troops combined with small unit tactics.
From what I have played so far the story is solid, it's amazing even, the artwork in the cut scenes is fantastic and fitting the overall tone of the game.
If your're looking for action heavy game play, massive battles or to command a large number of troops, this is not the game you're looking for.

The RTS activity is basically a resource-gathering minigame made slow and frustrating by event triggers and random patrols around any corner. You can never command more than 10 soldiers and the enemy always vastly outnumbers you. Stealth kills with the knife are the only way through most of the game but you will go mad waiting for enemy patrols to complete their waypoints. Full disclosure: I have not finished this one, but my least favorite missions in any RTS are stealth missions. So far, every single mission in the game is a stealth mission. So far, most missions have required multiple attempts because of unforeseeable circumstances. Be sure you have spare beds or else if you happen to find more friendly reinforcements than you have beds on the train, the excess troops are lost forever. Maybe the developers confuse frustration with storytelling. If you get a game over a message is displayed to the effect of, this is how war is. Is it? Certainly silly and unrealistic gameplay moments reduce the sense of tragedy and intrigue which should have been the focus. 

Gun combat is stripped down. Every gun has the same range-- 25 meters. They are nearly identical save for the ammo type consumed. Cover has slots and only protects troops in the slots. In other words, cover does not block line-of-sight. If a target is in range, it can be hit through cover unless touching the cover slot. If you try to flank, withdraw, or cram more troops in than the cover has slots, those soldiers will begin taking hits upon the next enemy shot because they always prioritize the targets in the open. A running target doesn't get any extra chance to evade damage. This makes flanking cost health, the most expensive resource in the game. The AI doesn't seem to try to use cover or any attack except a frontal human wave (or trickle) which is easily mowed down. Stationary enemies placed behind cover do become problematic as your hit rate drops close to zero. I spent hundreds of rounds in a comically long firefight against one soldier. Resources like grenades and machine gun rounds allow easy kills through cover but are expensive and sparingly provided. Using these resources in battle doesn't require skill. The grenade throw ability has nearly as much range as any rifle so maneuvering is not required. The MG has an active suppression ability which stops the enemy from shooting at you outright. Features that are basic in other games would have made this one perfect. Evasion, critical hits, organic suppression, true line of sight, vision impairment, and a non-braindead AI would all have been necessary for a well-rounded period war game.",1702065804,1702089208,False,4,0,0.481082290410995483,0,True,False,False

The balance if off in my view as a veteran though, you are cast as the veteran Czechoslovakian army, drafted in to help Russia for a guarantee of statehood. the build out is great, but, the balance seems very poor.
As a veteran Army with several years of field experience in unit and battalion command, they do very poorly with an inexperienced conscripted Red Army. Though there might be a few veterans in the ranks of this army, their hit ratio compared to your army is extremely high.
Additionally, the chances of individuals staying in the fight once most of their command is down, are very slim. So needing to fight every conscript in every engagement is pretty unreal, and the amount of damage your forces take, even under cover, is unrealistic compared to the damage you do unless you really change the balance in settings.
The only other change that is pretty glaring is foraging, is to think that you cannot find game in the area of Russia and Siberia they are traveling through, during that time in history, is very unrealistic.

The game has delivered on everything I could ever have wanted and more. 
Combat is dynamic, challenging and very, very fun. While snipers are definetly a little overpowered each class has it's uses and there is a reason to bring one of every class to combat. Combat also feels realistic. Being in the open is a death sentence, machine guns shred, Vehicles are powerful but only good when supported by infantry. Likewise artillery can be game changing but requires scoutting and spotting to make it effective. 
The noncombat parts are also fun. The scavenging, resource management and exploration mechanics are very fun to engage with. They have the right amount of challenge and it constantly provides you with interesting dilemas. Do I sell coal, steel and cloth for better guns ? Or guns for more materials. Upgrading ones train is also quite satisfying.
The game is also drop dead gorgeous. Seriously.actually stunning how pretty the game looks and there has been so much effort put into the graphics. Any upgrades on the train can be seen, if you add more beds to a car you will see more beds get added to the car. Any upgraded weapon added to a squad can be seen in rendered detail. Likewise were missions occur are always in interesting and beautiful locations whether it be swamps and forests or Moscow. 
Likewise the history is amazing. Is this a 1 for 1 story of the Czech Legion ? No. But it pays honest tribute to the exploits of the legion, highlights some of their greatest succeses, for example the heist of russian gold reserves and make's sure that whenever possible to provide more information through an in-depth in-game encyclopedia.

So what are my gripes with the game ? Well I have exactly 2. I wish the game had more combat classes and a larger selection of weapons. As of right now there are 5 combat classes Grenadier, Scout, Rifleman, Machine Gunner and Medic. Each class has only 3 unique weapons. It would have been cooler to have more weapon types and upgrades. For example, I would have loved to have a dedicated anti-tank role. Or perhaps a flamethrower, or an CQC class. It would have also been interesting see more dynamic choices for weapons requiring more strategy. 
My second gripe is that you can't have a vehicle car on your train which means that sheperding a tank through a mission is unrewarding. It would have been really cool to be able to scavenge tanks and take them with you on your train. I would even be fine if they required artillery shells for amo and fuel to run. I like going loud and it would have been amazing to bring a real punch to certain battles. 

Other then that the game has been amazing and a standout for me this year. I could easily recommend this to all strategy enjoyers. Also, there is a free demo that allows you to play the first two chapters which if played in full have about 4-6 hours of stuff to do which is simply amazing. If you're on the fence get the demo and try that first. Only issue with the demo is that sadly nothing you do there carries over should you get the full game.",1701962139,1701962139,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like XCOM, I like tactical turn based, and real time with pause RPGs. I didn't like this one.

I found the combat a bit shallow, and the characterisation (I did stop playing after 90 mins so I could refund) was shallow/kind of silly (of the communist general, the major, and the train crew) - that's fine! It seemed pretty easy to just stealth kill every enemy. As I said, I didn't play more than 90 mins maybe that changes, but it was unsatisfying. 

I can't put my finger on WHY I didn't like it, but I'd say if you like other more simulation heavy tactical rpgs this could be for you. The in combat tactical element didn't seem too deep, but rather the train and resource management did. That kind of higher level strategic control was not something I was looking for, and not something I enjoy. 

Making sure you have fuel, bullets, and materials to keep the train going could be appealing to some, but not to me. It's a bit too detailed. The developers have made a mode that minimises the difficulty on that, however, I wanted to refund the game, so did not get a chance to play it, I played on commander mode - where resource and train management have the same level of difficulty as combat control.

Actually a solid and well written semi fiction game that talks about one of the bloodiest civil wars in history and tells an unbelievable story about the deeds of the Czechoslovak Legion. The idea is great and the execution aswell! The missions are fun to play (yet closer to the end become a bit tedious) and the survival part of the train is something that will keep you up the whole time. I wouldn´t say tha the characters will take your breath away but for sure you will feel anxious about losing your men (and women) and not completing the ride to Vladivostok. The Orders are clear Major. Get the last train safely to Vladivostok through the frozen forest of Siberia.

Interesting part: I actually visited a real life replica of one of those Czechoslovak trains. Very similiar to the train you will get the chance to operate and the guns used are for the most part accurate. And I recommend about reading about the Legion a bit. Those mad, desperate and heroic soldiers did some crazy stuff on the Trans-Siberian Railway.

I wrote this review while my train reached Vladivostok safely, after 26 hours of using only the southern routes and using all available towns and side villages i could find for my fellow soldiers. It was a hard custom tactician effort to make it out alive but in the end we managed to head home.

I recommend to you dear reader, to take the northern route for a safer journey towards Vladivostok, as the combat encounter was a mix between commandos and standard company of heroes in which stealth played a vital role.

Set amidst the rubble of the Bolshevik Revolution (1917 ish I think), you command an army of troops as they locomotive their way across the great Russian expanse.  

Jumping right into it, this game is a wonderfully dense blend of tactical strategy, management (and gathering) of resources, personnel, and history.  Not only that, it's also executed in it's own very pretty way, with the deep tones of grime, industry and war painted right into it.  

It is taking some extra time to get acclimated to a real-time system as my normal games (civ, xcom2 for example) are mostly turn based, but they did a really good job of integrating a 'strategic' mechanism that allows for pausing and planning while trying to manage your troops.  It has honestly been a great game to dip my toes deeper into the waters of real-time strategy.

Anyway, I've barely scratched the surface of the game, so hopefully as I continue playing, I find that I get more accustomed to the play style and that the challenge maintains the right balance.  However, things are very positive thus far so I wanted to get them a good review early.

You gain attachments to your soldiers and are sad when some of them are killed and the overworld train events are also super fun.

It is a survival/management/strategy game in which you are tasked with getting a train full of surviving members of the Legion eastward to the port of Vladivostok and, eventually, home to the newly formed nation of Czechloslovakia. It is up to you to manage your supplies and personnel effectively, deciding when and where to stop the train to send out squads to gather supplies or complete missions along the way. The combat is very fun and you really have to think in certain missions... is every engagement worth fighting? Not only could it lead to the death/injury of your squad, but it could prove to be a tremendous waste of your resources.

I will definitely be giving this multiple playthroughs, as there are many choices to be made in the story (much like The Banner Saga and similar games.)  Easily hours of game time to be had.

Overall a fantastic game loyal to the history as it was and commemorating a story that, at least in America, is not heard nearly as much as it should. The bravery and determination of the Legion should be remembered always.

Great historical game and well worth the price with 52 hours for one playthrough. 

I encountered a few bugs but nothing game breaking. The one that randomly leaves squad members behind at the end of earlier chapters can seem very frustrating since you try so hard to keep everyone alive, but I picked up more than enough legionaries on my travel and was able to fully level up everyone on the way. Trucks bugged out on multiple occasions and the mission where I had to protect two of them in the mine was very frustrating because I couldn`t control them myself and they just kept driving on regardless of enemies. Once the medical car bugged out and one soldier was not able to leave after being healed with a message continuously popping up but a reload fixed that for me.

Other than that the game ran perfectly fine for me. 

I really enjoyed the story, a great piece of history told very well.

It scratches a lot of my ""gaming itches"" as you`ve got base building with the train management side, planning, upgrading, repairing and switching train cars. The squad management is very satisfying as well, you can really dive into it and spend a lot of time with it. You have morale, health, hunger, work efficiency and a lot of different skills and character traits to manage. You have scavenging, crafting and resource management. Dropping temperatures along the way influence a lot of your decisions. 

I usually lack the patience for stealth missions and the game doesn`t force you to continuously use stealth on most missions which is a big plus for me.

Absolutely recommend this game.

Instead, I'd like to tell you the stories of my best and worst soldiers over my first campaign in the game: Maximilián and Pavel. 

Maximilián is your scar-faced grandpa who served in three wars too many and can't remember where he is, or what year it is half the time. He's the grandad who gets you socks for christmas every year because he doesn't want you to get trench-foot when you ship off to fight in The Crimean War of 1854. (It's currently 1920.)

If you needed something to eat, Max would go out and come back with a truck full of hares, a lake's worth of fish or an elk tucked under each arm. Because he can't well have his grandkids going hungry now can he?

He's also the most lethal man in the entire legion with the highest body count, and that's only counting the people he remembers killing. If you need someone gone, either quiet or loud, Max is your man. He was by far and large my most reliable soldier, and after every mission he and the rest of squad one got to recuperate with a hot meal and a rest in my most well-furnished infantry car. 


By the time our merry band reached Vladivostok, Maximilián and the rest of squad one were more accolades and medals than men (and women). The very best of what the Czechoslovakian Legion had to offer. Max in particular having become a legend in his own right, stepping off that train and right into the annals of history.
 

On the other end of the scale is Pavel, a genetic dead-end from the shallow end of the gene pool. A man so incompetent he couldn't be trusted to do something as simple as peel a potato without losing part of a hand.

When I sent him out with one of the other teams to gather wood, he'd lose the Axe. if he went foraging, he'd eat poisonous berries. If he went hunting he'd fall in a river, every time. So I stopped sending him out because he'd sabotage whatever effort he was a part of with his gross incompetence. But the troubles didn't end there. 

He couldn't cook, shovel coal, build, or operate the machine-gun in the artillery car without being critically injured. He's the entire reason I ended up buying a hospital car, where he had an almost permanent residence. Eventually I got so fed up with his nonsense I started inflicting disciplinary actions on him. When he'd fuck up, I'd withhold his rations for a day, or turn off the heating in his residential car, of which he was the sole occupant. Eventually I would tape a hammer to one of his stump-arms and send him in, alone, to deal with the mouse infestations in the storage car, at night, when it was coldest. Often times the mice won. 

Eventually I got enough versatile personnel where I could just let him sit in his car and eat paint chips or roll around in the hay that made up his bed. When we reached Vladivostok I imagine he had to he hauled onto the evacuation ship in a wheelbarrow, since he'd undoubtedly lost most of his limbs by that point. My most mangled soldier and he'd never seen actual combat, not once. Somewhere in Czechoslovakia, a village has its idiot back.

So far;
It's really nice, kind of multiple mix of game. ;
I can feel the control are much similar to ''Alien Dark Descent'' and you also have resources management same as ''IXION'', ''Frostpunk'' or ''AOE''.
For folks who did played ''Metros Exodus'' you might feel the same country side immersion which is Great!! 
Same for the locomotive, which you have the chance to make it more effective and armed thru the game.

As you command a legion of Czechoslovak soldiers, you'll face the perils of the Trans-Siberian Railway, battling opposing factions, managing your train's resources, and making tough decisions that will determine the fate of your comrades.

The game masterfully interweaves engaging real-time tactical combat with strategic base management. You'll carefully deploy your troops, utilizing their unique skills and equipment to overcome enemy strongholds. Meanwhile, back on the train, you'll need to balance resource production, maintain morale, and tend to the wounded.

Last Train Home's narrative is equally compelling, immersing you in the struggles and camaraderie of the Czechoslovak legion. You'll encounter a diverse cast of characters, each with their own motivations and backstories, as you navigate the complexities of the Russian Revolution.

While the game offers a fair amount of challenge, it also provides a satisfying sense of accomplishment. Overcoming obstacles, securing resources, and witnessing the growth of your legion feel truly rewarding.

You can also approach the mission with stealth or guns blazing! which again you will need to think about based on your squad status and resources. Then like in Aliens: Dark Descent you will manage a base or in this case a train, using the resources you find from the missions or the world map to upgrade it and the carts attached. Such as a hospital cart, food cart, squad living quarters and an artillery cart. Keeping a fine balance between how you manage these and your soldiers themselves with the resources you have at a given time is what will influence what struggles you will face later on in the game. Tough decisions will have to be made at certain points to whether that be having to ration your food between your soldiers causing hunger or being short on ammunition so splitting what few bullets you have between your soldiers when deploying them to a mission.  You will also get random events occur during your journey that you will have to decide on how to resolve and depending on what you pick could have positive or negative impacts on your play through.

I bought the game mainly because I like the mix between Frostpunk and Company of Heroes and I like to support small developers over big game companies.

(I was also fortunate enough to not come across many of the bugs or hardware issues others have had involving crashing and other issues, my play through was entirely seamless so my review will result in more positive light.)

From the get go the game teaches you simply, that you need to gather resources if you're going to survive. What it does not teach you is how vital it is to have the correct people for the correct missions. Each character gets a set of traits that make them vital for certain points of interest that allow you to collect resources or better complete side missions. If you do not utilize this information properly you can easily run out of supplies before you have even made it halfway.If you have the someone with a negative trait it can affect how characters or provide different outcomes to events. Should you decide to rely heavily on certain items you can change the characters traits, making a character you always sent out on certain tasks now unreliable for that certain task due to their change in trait and reliance upon that substance.

The game also teaches you about the different combat roles and teaches you the basics as you play, however it does not inform you (or I failed to see it) that you can multi class your troops. Meaning your sniper who is maxed out can also learn to be a medic. He can now heal your troops while also being a highly lethal marksman. Your riflemen can spec into scout and have a bayonet charge while also having stealth abilities of a scout. You're medic can become a grenadier and so on. 

The combat utilization is amazing from a game I had only seen in passing it was a pleasant surprise to how enjoyable it was. I found myself on many occasions using a team of snipers to recon an area for my machine gunners to set up kill boxes while my riflemen and grenadiers pushed flanks.  On most of the games missions and maps you are given an objective and it is up to you how you complete it. I found myself wiping out whole bases without the assistance from the game purely because of well utilized tactics and planning. The other half of the game which I found most enjoyable was the task of operating and conducting the train. When you complete the tutorial you are given a starter train that you will upgrade and outfit to your liking. 

As the game progresses you realize how important proper management and planning is to survival. Not only do you have to be smart with your decisions of who and what you bring from the start of the game, you also have to prepare for the journey that you have ahead of you through Siberia. You are introduced into upgrading your train and quickly realize the high cost of having a long train heavy expensive train compared to a short and economical one. There are many options and for each car and each locomotive that you choose to bring along on your journey and they all provide different bonus' and supportive options. Depending on your play style you can create a large armored monstrosity that can simply tear through any obstacles with ease while providing astounding fire support to you're troops during their excursions. You can also make the train into a self sustaining factory that is able to create all the supplies you need as long as you have the vital few resources that cannot be crafted.  [spoiler]If you waste time in the beginning and fail to prepare for the Siberian winter you are headed into, you quickly learn of your blunder in the way of freezing passengers getting sick all up and down your train cars. [/spoiler]  

I went into this game expecting a nice maybe enjoyable but simple looking squad based rts. However, the story telling and writing; as well as, the core mechanics are far above what I expected. As I dove further and further into each chapter of the game I began feeling more and more with the characters of my squad and passengers on my train. When I lost troops in combat in most games I would save scum and go back to save them, but in this game that would involve restarting the mission completely, in a sense forcing the player to decide if it is worth it. The joy of sending out squads to scavenge and coming across an event kept growing more and more as progressed through the game. All these small side events with their own choices and results that could be a vital help or detriment to you're journey. You are presented situations with choices that can both be right, but have a moral choice alongside them that relies upon the player to choose which outcome they would prefer. 

Throughout the game you are presented a to many different stories and characters of those that are having to suffer during the Russian revolution. You are presented with information that can mean nothing to you or seem like just lore, however if you take the time to read all the characters interactions and realize how what the player chooses can result in learning more or less, or causing different things to happen based on who you chose to use. You quickly realizes this game is not as simple as it seems to be. It is an extremely well made game that is able to tell in beautiful detail with writing and artistry the stories of so many, that truly caught me off guard. I found myself wanting to play it more and more whenever I could, I wanted to find all the stories and change the results of my decisions to see how things could have played out differently. 


If you enjoy a game with great story telling and very satisfying combat and management systems then I definitely think this is a title you should pickup. I myself was debating refunding it based on the reviews it had on launch while I was downloading it thinking I should perhaps wait for some more reviews. However, I can happily say I am very satisfied I gave this game a chance.

Highest difficulty.

It combines the ""home front"" decision making of This War of Mine or State of Decay with the combat of Dawn of War 2 or Company of Heroes.  All told during a period of time that will make any fan of the World Wars era happy.

Something Last Train Home adds that I wish Dawn of War 2 had was an ""active pause"" where you can survey cover, use abilities, and give orders during stop time.  For a tactical game, this is a must.  On highest difficulty, soldiers out of cover pretty much get hit every time a shot is fired.  I think most soldiers can take 4 hits before dying, but even one hit has implications on the strategy map when bullets aren't flying.

If I have one complaint, it is that the UI is a little clunky with the day/night shifts and identifying which soldiers are working which job.  But this happens when the game is paused and is not a significant issue.

The longer version is.

I finish it in about 25-30 ish hours (have forgotten to close it sometimes).
And I enjoy it all of the time.

I love the idea of the story of the Czech Legion's escape from The Russian Civil War to their newly founded homeland
is a great setting idea and taking it as you are the last ones to try to escape as the only way home is to go eastward.

The gameplay is very simple in it is you send some people on a mission that will get you resources, allies, clearing the rail, or other kinds of aid. In these missions, you control a squad of people you assemble to do this task classic standard, Riflemen, Medic, Gunner, Sniper, and gnadier. They are only customizable in their abilities you might wanna take or weapon to that class but anyone can become one of these classes. Loved all the abilities could see used in all of them, especially the rifleman bayonet charge :). 

When not on the mission you manage the train and stop at points of interest loot small places and work on your train upgrading it. It just feels so good to put the work in on the train. it feels homely and nice you also use the same people to work on it they all also have a Worker occupation in addition to a combat role they can also learn different job roles such as Worker, Engineer, Medic, and Cook so that the brain functions.

every character has a bio if you wanna learn a little more about them.

I like the story, love it when they both do drawing and some acting or real footage or at least I think it is real. love the advisor for the narration of the different feelings he has on a situation.

for difficulty, I would say at least for me it is very easy to get by. I would recommend changing the difficulty at some point or it can be quite easy to travel to Russia but none I did enjoy it more when I tweaked the difficulty for a bit.

here, in the end, I would deem this to be like a 9.5/10 or at least a 9 I love these kinda games so I am a little biased I also like a game called The Partisans which is much like this but this captivated me more and I just love it that much I plan on playing it a couple of times at least 100% it may be some dumb challenges I might think of.

Also noteworthy I haven't even gotten to half the game so I'll only speak of the early game which I'm currently past. Most weapons I replaced for better varients and every wagon got a few upgrades. I'm becoming more familiar with the skills and how I can combine them so I feel like I can give some feedback.

The game does excellent job at making you struggle for resources and there is no 'infinite money glitch' that would ruin balance or immersion, but granadier and medic are pretty much pointless on highest preset difficulty. Medic is not useful unless he has rank 5 passive which takes forever to get to and Granadier uses expensive explosives which you do have resources for, but no need for and timing grenades can be difficult unless enemies aren't alerted at which point I'd rather bayonet or sneak attack them and then precision shot by Scouts which only consume 1 rifle ammo. Machine Gunner always felt like an overkill even when stealth went south. The amount of enemies that get alerted is always no more than a half dozen as enemies just a screen away don't get pulled in and I'm allowed to bring 10 soldiers into every mission when the difficulty of the maps is made for 4-5. I think there should have been a tech that expands squad size and the starting should be 5-6 at most. There is basically no threat to 10 soldiers in cover, high ranks or not. Generally sneak attacks + bayonet charges + critical hits clean up anything and everything outside an armored car. The game is perfect for extremely tactical and thoughtful engagement, but caters more toward run and gun with how many soldiers you get to work with and how many you can bomb rush objectives with. Couple bruises bare no significance as even without medical wagon there is enough time between fights for soldiers to regenerate and if not just bring one of your 3-4 reserve soldiers.

Train maintenance can get annoying if you don't have people in permanent spots, lack of proper filters makes it hard to find ideal candidates, but you don't want to make them permanent as you want to level them up at least a bit in combat so they're somewhat usable in higher difficulty missions.

The game makes me think it's meant to be hardcore, but it feels tailored for average casual gamers even on the intended highest difficulty before going into Custom tweaks which as a new player I didn't want to get into, but the game is just too easy. Most missions I don't even have to shoot thanks to stealth and when I do screw up I never feel threatened because the damage enemies do is low and chance to hit is also very low when I use basic cover. Unless I don't pause the game to afk and get attacked I don't expect any gamer to actually lose soldiers in missions. I would have preferred if the difficulty was more similar to XCOM games, where you truly struggle.

The amount of legionaries recruited feels too many and too early. I never felt like I needed to overwork my soldiers or send them out with low HP, because there is plenty of replacements and the game failed to challenge me so far and the resource gathering is already getting a bit boring as it's always the same types with always the same small results pool. I already think of doing a run with either only 1 of each class or a run with just a single unit, probably a scout/rifleman and sneak attack through the game. I'm certain that it'll be possible if a bit tedious.

When it comes to bugs on first week of release there is only 2 I'm noticing, one was a wooden bridge I lacked instruction on how to advance through a flank so I was forced to go across the heavily armed bridge of which none could be distracted with pebbles so shooting was inevitable. I assume it was a bug as there was no indication of how to construct the wooden bridge or what to do. The second bug has more to do with soldiers targeting same cover spots and merge together until you move them again, that can make it difficult finding them and it breaks immersion a bit as well as it makes the game easier at times. Unit can sometimes get stuck on some obstacle or unit in their path, but only very, very rarely and it hasn't happened to me in combat yet.

I like everything else and I'd say it's worth the price for me as it's the exact type of gameplay I wanted to experience and I have nothing to really compare it to except XCOM which has significant differences so perhaps I'm not the guy to tell you how it fares to others in it's genre, all I can tell you I'm interested in playing more games like this after playing it for a while so it must have executed some aspects well. I'm enjoying myself and I don't expect the rating to go lower. For me it's 8/10 so far and I'll update or rewrite this when I finish the game.",1701614600,1701614600,True,1,0,0.42143133282661438,0,True,False,False

[i]My offline playing time is around 12 hours. Steam does not display offline game hours correctly.[/i]

Last Train Home is a game that I consider to be a successful mix of ""Frostpunk"" (survival aspect), ""Jagged Alliance"" (squad management) and ""X-Com"" (home base expansion), combined with occasional real-time battles and a light ""Commandos"" vibe. All wrapped up in a World War I based scenario. A setting that is wonderfully fresh and works brilliantly with the game mechanics.

[b]-Love for details[/b] 
[i]For example, every soldier has a personal file with an exact description of the person.[/i]

[b]-Unused setting that fits the gameplay.[/b]
[b]-Easily accessible mechanics and controls.[/b]
[b]-Good performance and very few bugs.[/b]

[b]Neutral:[/b]
[b]-Research and production available.[/b]
[i]Both seem a bit forced, but ultimately enrich the gameplay.[/i]
[b]-Interface[/b]
[i]The Ui is good looking, but occasionally lacks important information.[/i]
[b]-Optics[/b]
[i]Mediocre visuals, with (just about) sufficient setting options for the graphics.[/i]

[b]Con:[/b]
[b]-The battles generelly lack depth.[/b]
[i]The real-time strategy part is only partially compatible with the tactical approach. A turn-based combat system would have been much better suited to the game's ""every soldier counts"" mentality.[/i]

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
A solid recommendation if you can overlook the weaker battles. If you're looking for a C&C game, you've come to the wrong place.

This is coming from an anarchist. What they did really well is show the realistic horror of war and people justifying cruelty and violence through an ideology which is what historically happens continuously. Placed in the correct historical context the Reds are authoritarian revolutionary fascists bent on taking over a state plunged in chaos and famine and they retroactively wrote history to make them seem like a united communist power but in reality they staged a coup when the tsar fell, persecuting their fellow revolutionaries in the fallout. The Whites are conservative fascists trying to hold on to power. The soldiers you fight against are portrayed are portrayed realistically as violent opportunists and you and your soldiers are beyond desperate trying to get home and see the land plunge into blood around you trying to help where you can afford to because the people will help you too. The game-play reflects this where you are always overpowered and have to use every tool you have in your advantage with stealth and the element of surprise being the most important one, strike first and only when necessary and you are certain to win. And it's very satisfying when you pull it off. This is during RTS battles or in the overworld, do not go out unless the benefit outweighs the risk. The gameplay and story do not work for you if you approach this with a Total War, Men of War or whatever RTS game history bro kind of mindset because you will NOT have a good time. Approach everything with a guerilla mindset and don't be ashamed to look up viable guerilla tactics that you can use if you have no idea where to begin. My only problems with the game are a few quality of life things like easier squad selection, hotkey options and it would be nice to always be able to see overworld relevant and roles when selecting any soldier so I don't have to keep going in and out of menus to find out that I put a soldier that can barter well in a squad that's currently foraging in a forest two hours away. Anyway, I recommend this game and please leave your hearts of iron history bro buff at the door because this game is about humanity and not banners and states. To the devs; thank you for this work of art & I can't wait what's coming next.

Published by THQ Nordic, it's a fictionalized telling of the Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion, a remarkable military campaign set in the midst of the Russian Revolution. I didn’t know this story, though it’s clearly important to the developers at Ashborne, whose home office is in Brno, Czech Republic.

[i]Last Train Home[/i] initially presents itself as a historical squad-command real time strategy game, akin to [i]Company of Heroes[/i]. In the game’s first moments, the player controls a team of soldiers, made up of the normal combat roles. There’s a rifleman, a grenadier, a medic, and so on. Each class has its strengths: the sniper can scout into the fog of war; the machine gunner can set up his weapon to anticipate enemy approaches. The players’ troops can be ordered to wander around the game’s gritty but varied maps, speaking with civilians, collecting loot, and attacking enemy positions. These engagements require careful deployment and thoughtful attention to adversaries’ abilities. (That said, there are some balancing issues: snipers are [i]ridiculously[/i] powerful, and the enemy AI occasionally blunders hilariously.)

This game’s combat compares well with that of THQ Nordic’s recent publication, [i]Jagged Alliance 3[/i]. Both utilize squad gameplay to highlight characters’ distinctive abilities, especially against superior enemy forces. What I most dislike about [i]JA3[/i] is the impossibility of pausing time to give orders before engaging in combat. [i]LTH[/i] smartly reverses this decision, allowing the player to pause at any time. Without an ability to think through a battle’s opening stages, my combat engagements regularly wind up as frantic affairs. Allowing the player to pause and strategize respects the game’s tactical promises.

Oh, I fear I’ve buried the lede: Between missions, instead of returning to a fortified base or warping to the next battle, the troops pile into a controllable, upgradable train.

I grew up near Chicago, home of folk singer-songwriter Steve Goodman. His best-known tune, notably recorded by Arlo Guthrie and Willie Nelson, is “The City of New Orleans,” a song about a real-life train that runs 19 hours overnight from Illinois, down through Memphis, all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. Goodman refers to the vehicle as a “magic carpet made of steel,” and he contrasts its industrious glide with the decay he sees along its journey, as they pass “the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.”[1] A similar dichotomy–the lively engine, the desolate countryside–is at the heart of [i]Last Train Home[/i].

While the Red Army has pillaged portions of rural Russia in the name of the people, the Czechoslovak Legion utilizes and ultimately controls the rails, maintaining their train as it treks eastward, on toward Vladivostok. (If you’re unaware of European and Asian geography, then-extant Czechoslovakia was to the west of Russia. The Legion went east to get west, arriving at a seaport approximately 15,000 kilometers away from their home territory.)

In the train phase, as the locomotive chugs along, the player must attend to upkeep and logistics. The focus on individual soldiers drops away, except as they play overall roles: some are cooks, some doctors, others engineers. Giving out assignments and interacting with characters’ needs and abilities can be a little fiddly, but with a little scouring of the menus, this gameplay becomes generally intuitive. At your command, the troops address the business of running the train, stoking the locomotive’s fire and repairing cracked cars. The ""pistons keep on churnin' / and the wheels go 'round and 'round.""[2] At times, the train discovers notable areas, and troops can be deployed to forage or barter. Success in these events depends on soldiers' traits. An empathetic doctor won’t happily hunt, but a better-suited character will gladly harvest scads of flesh.

When the fuel stockpile is full, the hospital car empty[3], and the soldiers seemingly enjoying their relaxation, the train’s progress can feel nearly idyllic. I found myself noting, “I've been happy lately, thinking about the good things to come, and I believe it could be something good has begun.""[4] But it never lasts. Inevitably something goes wrong, the food runs low, someone damages the locomotive, and suddenly [i]LTH[/i] resonates with the style of the equally depressing [i]Frostpunk[/i] or perhaps the tone of [i]This War of Mine[/i]. Do the children go work in the generator? Are the refugees sent away? Which soldiers starve this week? The game presents impossibly weighty choices, and the player recognizes the difficulty of the command position, realizing that to play this game is to be “living with something that just isn't fair.”[5]

A complaint in the current Steam reviews is the game’s political biases. Is it anti-communist? Is it pro-communist? These questions are absurd. The game is a fictionalized telling of the Legion’s exploits but not egregiously so: in this setting, the politics are partially determined. Individual soldiers have ideological commitments, but the game’s movements follow history. The Legion didn’t adopt the Revolution’s goals, namely the “formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.”[6] To expect otherwise would be to shift the story to alternate history, which isn’t this game’s intent.

What I love about [i]LTH[/i] is the introduction to other people’s important stories. Like most Americans, I’m ignorant of the rest of the world’s history. I know twentieth century Europe primarily through the lens of American involvement, the military heroism taught to me in my school years and by Tom Hanks. My limitations become even more pronounced when I focus on particular countries. What do I know about the Czech? Franz Kafka lived in Prague, but don’t quote me on it. I now know a little more about the Czechoslovak Legion and their incredible struggle to get out of Russia, to find their way back home. This story matters to people who aren't me, but I appreciate our common humanity.

Much contemporary media mines history for stories worth telling while taking such narrative liberties that the player winds up with nothing of historical value. Consider the mass of Assassin’s Creeds. Though ach installment introduces players to a flashy past setting–Ptolemaic Egypt, the Italian Renaissance, etc.–the learning is sketchy at best. These settings are all familiar enough: they have resonance to sell the games to a major market segment. Quasi-historical games like those use their source material primarily as attention-grabbing background and forgettable plot fixtures (behold, Athens; behold, George Washington!).

Historical video games are at their best when they connect the player to important and compelling history that’s at risk of otherwise being lost. Or, as Tom Waits warns, ""[M]emory's like a train. You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away, and the things you can't remember tell the things you can't forget.""[7]

Just be ready because this game is brutal. Its frostpunk but with combat. The combat is generally engaging but the stealth portion is broken as enemies (realistically) change their patrol patterns. While realistic this is unsuitable to a game as its impossible to be stealthy for really any period of time as its impossible to plan your movement. One moment a guard walks around a building and the next they change the pattern and retrace their steps out of nowhere thus seeing you soldier sneaking up on them. It makes stealth frustrating. Combat itself is fine except for machine gun emplacements. They are extremely difficult to deal with. While realistic, having enemies like that that knock your troops down in a single burst while also having them out range all of your troops means its just a slog where you will lose most of your troops to one machine gun. Its just impossible to ""use tactics"" against such enemies as the bayonet charge just hits the gun itself not the enemy controlling it, your handheld machine guns dont have the range, and your grenades cant be thrown long enough.

That whole adventure on the train, surrounded by wilderness and peril both from Reds and Whites, always fascinated me. I must say that this game brings me back to that masterpiece, with a little known episode of the end of World War I involving the Czech Legion, formed by former Austro-Hungarian POWs that fought for the Allies in exchange for guarantees from Czar Nicholas II to allow the creation of Czechoslovakia after the war. The Legion was a neutral unit in the Russian Civil War and was to cross Siberia to reach Vladivostok and there board a boat that would take them back home (""to go West, you must go East""). This game brings back this historical episode to life, and is similar to Frostpunk and This War of Mine (in the gathering of resources) with some squad-based combat. The train management part is pretty good; for the combat part, I would have preferred a turn-based combat, but that's a personal preference, since I do not like RTS fighting. A bonus is that you get to kill Bolsheviks and (almost) save the Russian imperial family, Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this great episode of Russian History.

The atmosphere is amazing. The story is a bit hard to believe sometimes (we're running on a single track but... no other train never cross our path !), but it's still very original and, overall, compelling. You get attached to your soldiers.

The train management part is good. Well, it would be amazing if some QoL were not blatantly missing (someone forgot that ""drag and drop"" existed). But, overall, it's really cool and original.

Unfortunatly, the tactical part of the game destroys everything. It becomes... atrocious after a while. It's an extremly repetitive mix between and overly simplified stealth game like Commando and an overly simplified Company of Heroes. The stealth part is ridiculous, because the AI is dumb as a rock. Talking about rock, scouts, who can freely hide in plain sight, can throw rocks without losing stealth to attract enemies one by one and kill them with a knife. I decided to stop playing the game after doing a major story mission with one single scout, without shooting a single bullet, but throwing wheelbarrows of rocks. You can pick up members of a squad one by one, all on the exact same spot, and no one will find anything suspicious.

At some point in a previous mission, I was facing a 12 soldier squad in a courtyard, with a commanding officier a bit away, apparently yelling orders at them. I threw a grenade, killed the 12 soldiers. The officier ran out, didnot find me (because... I moved, doh !), so he decided that nothing was happening, everything was normal, and he went back to his spot, yelling orders to a big pile of bloody flesh.

The tactical fights part is a bit less terrible, but still not great. All weapons have the same range. You can't enter buildings. Some skills are rather clunky. Many opponents just run around like idiots, etc. Anyway, even if the tactical fights part was ok, you couldnot play the game only fighting, because bullets are too rare. You have to use stealth.

But why?

Because its not just about tactical combat, but also about managing your troops outside of it, so its not just robots that exist only in the missions, not to mention the game have missions where you dont even have to shoot, but rather help local population in the Hearts and Minds way.

The game is telling a story about soldiers at war and its doing a great job. A lot of games dont portray war crimes, or even the dark sides of the fighting ideologies.

You can adjust the difficulty to your liking. Don't you like managing stuff? reduce the difficulty of that part, same for combat.

There is not much in terms of replayability except for increasing the difficulty.

Optimization, the game runs absolutely fine, but for this style of game, it should run a lot better and not melt your GPU in the process.

1) The strongest part right now seems to be the train management. It's held back by some dumb UI decisions, such as not showing the soldier traits when selecting a best person for a job, or not giving any useful sorting options for this. Also, leaving the people on repair jobs permanently even if the job is finished and the train is already moving - you have to remember that you put people there, and manually reassign them. Otherwise, pretty good.
2) The tactical combat is very arcade-y. It's wonky, and the tactics are reduced to managing the intersection of circles - every weapon in the game has the same range, from a sniper rifle to a pistol, and the same accuracy in this whole range. Stealth is encouraged by game design, but stealth mechanics lack any depth. Maps look nice, but they are underutilized - you can't get inside buildings, and the cover slots are usually poorly placed. Why can I put a soldier behind this barricade, but not that one? Well, the map designer decided for you, don't complain.
3) The game is based on a very fascinating story, but I already see that the Devs decided for a cartoonishly black-and-white approach to it - the Czechoslovak Legion are saints fighting through the hordes of evil Russians. I am not fan of the Reds in this Civil War, but here they are evil just for the sake of being evil. The writers didn't know what to do with the civilians, so the civilians are really amorphous and somehow support the Legion killing their sons and fathers (I am not joking, it's in the game).
4) I switched to an ""Immersive"" voice acting setting, which is supposed to switch between Czech, Slovak, and Russian. I was wondering how the Devs would tackle the language barrier problem between all these people. Surely there was something interesting to be done there? Turns out, ""Immersive"" is just mostly Czech, and apparently every Russian babushka fluently speaks to the protagonists in Czech.... I just switched back to English, at least it doesn't pretentiously calls itself ""Immersive"".

The RTS gameplay feels a little like an old school RTS without the tendency of newer games introducing clunky/gimmicky combat mechanics.  And I am getting into the story so far of a group of soldiers during WW1 trying to remain neutral in Russian civil war post WW1 with the rise of the Bolsheviks, just trying to get back home.

Again, kind of feels liek an old Company of Heroes game without the ""fluff"" gimmicks.  Base buillding is there in the form of  your train.  Worth checking out",1701513546,1701513546,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very captivating and well-made game. I deeply appreciate having an option of Czech&Slovak dabing as well as HUD; it's also nice to see familiar faces of some Czech actors in certain cutscenes (and as a basis for some characters visage) and hear their voices as well during dabing. 
So far, I have not encountered any bugs and felt very immersed into the story and missions from the beginning. 
I like the game mechanics, the story as a whole and also stories of each of the legionairs, the train updating and managing, sending the legionairs to missions, random events, setting options...

I love this game, from the train resource management to the tense real time battles. There are a few bugs here and there but nothing too terrible, all visual bugs. Enemies are varied which keeps things from getting stale and your legionaries certainly feel like the trained soldiers they're supposed to be. I appreciate that each soldier is their own person with unique bios and characteristics. Some classes (scout) feel like they have really useful abilities (SCOUT) that outshine some of other classes, although each class is distinctive and useful and they are each required for an effective team (but you can totally have mostly scouts).

I have read all 85 negative reviews that have been written in time of this review. Here are some insides! 

39 of the people giving this game a bad review played the game for less than 2 hours.
For more than 10 hours there are only 20 reviews, 10 of them in chinese.

I will divide frequent complaints into two groups based on time played, and comment on each of them. 

0-5 hours complains
“The game is anti-russian propaganda” (mostly in russian)
“combat isn't tactical, there are not any abilities (they are, but you cannot know that, if you did literally one level)
“Stealth doesn't work” (Stealth does work. You just need to actually hide in some bush and be quiet lmao)
“Machine guns are killing my soldiers” (They do that, yeah. Mostly in real life tho)
“The game isn't in english, doesn’t have manual save, weapons have limited range” (wtf?)
“Game doesn't launch” (Ok this actually sucks, i feel sorry about you)
 
5+ hours complains
“Game is anti-communist propaganda” (In chinese this time)
“game is too easy” (try to save scum less)
“game is too hard” (try to use save button)
“game is unbalanced” (Ok, snipers are broken, but really fun)
“combat is shallow” (To be fair, if you are looking for hardcore tactical strategies, there are better candidates on the market for you. But this game is not just about the tactical fights. It has many more things to it, and the fights aren’t even the main focus. Even though, i wouldn't call them shallow)
“UI is terrible, and i have to do everything manually” (I honestly don´t find the UI to be bad, but it is true that some QoL changes would be appreciated)
“game is buggy” (I have in fact found some annoying bugs, but in my opinion, talking about optimization and state of release, this game is still in the better half) 


In conclusion, There are few semi-valid points around. Some classes feel stronger than others, and AI is truly braindead sometimes (It would be really cool if they would react on death bodies, but that would make the game much, much harder) But overall? I feel that at least 70 out of 85 negative reviews weren't justified. The game is great, and you definitely should try it. It literally has a 5 hour free demo so go for it. 

As for me now, I am going to touch some grass before returning to my favourite cozy train game about shooting bolsheviks.

The whole game is centered around a text-heavy narrative that provides a believable background for the management aspect. You are given command of a military train and its crew and are free to decide on the roles and schedule of your men. On top of that is a basic economic layer where you have to decide on how to use your resources between maintenance and upgrades. Both of these mechanics are kept simple, but still manage to offer some interesting dilemma and aid narrative tension. I especially like the personality traits for your crew, which not only let me imagine a colourful, interesting group of protagonists with just a glance, but also have strong gameplay implications. I also like the train model itself, where you can watch your men in whimsical make-shift quarters while making your decisions.
Your efforts in keeping your crew in shape pay off in many small real time tactics missions you will encounter in your journey. These do not offer much depth  and seem like a powerfantasy of slaughtering hundreds of bolshevik (played on normal), but feel like a reward for keeping your men in good shape.
The weakest part for me are the narrative cutscenes, which strongly clash with the actual gameplay. In the cutscenes, the game tells me of keeping neutrality in the russian civil war and making compromises.

Story: 10 / 10
I'm a slut for more WW1 games. While the setting has gotten some more love in recent years, Last Train Home's premise and subsequent game mechanics are unique enough to set it apart. It is also well crafted enough to provide the opportunity to immerse yourself and explore the setting.

Gameplay: 8 / 10
Last Train Home loses points here for features that I feel should be in the game but aren't. Some of these include:

- Enterable buildings. Your units should be able to enter structures for full cover, especially if they aren't actively inhabited at a particular location. This is particularly noticeable on missions requiring you to defend or capture certain structures.

- Recoverable Machinery. Some missions will have operable machinery like heavy machine guns, trucks, etc. You should be able to recover heavy machine guns for re-sale or deployment at the cost of extra stamina. Similarly, you should be able to drive a truck back to the train if you find one in a mission, reducing the stamina cost or even allowing the passengers to recover stamina during the trip back. You should also be able to sell the truck if your squad takes it to a city.

- Machinery Quibble #2: Heavy machine guns can currently only rotate in place. You should be able to tow them or move them with a crew to different locations within the mission.

- Machinery Quibble #3: Some missions contain artillery pieces utilized by the AI. As far as I've found, the only way to stop the AI from using artillery pieces is to destroy them. This sucks because your crew is capable of operating an artillery car, so they should be able to make use of recovered artillery pieces as well.

Graphics: 9 / 10
The maps and missions are well crafted. The imagery is also evocative. When the game presents a snowy landscape or a harsh scene, you feel cold. Room for improvement would be the model textures.

Sound: ? / 10
I'll refrain from judging the sound until I actively pay attention to it. As I type this I realized that I unconsciously tuned out most of the audio as I played the game. Was I so engrossed with the game that the audio flew past me, or was it so meh that I didn't register it? Idk, take that for what you will.

Multiplayer: N / A
None at this time.

The tutorial in the beginning was good but nothing super special so I was like yeah good game but for 40€? And then I completted chapter one and that awesome cinematic cutseen and story kicked in and now I am all in for this game!

The one critic point I have is that it seems that every gun has the same range and that stealth is a bit bugged sometimes. For now, since the game is only out for a few days, I can be fine with it... hope it gets fixed tho

The mix of survival, combat and RPG elements with crew management and train upgrade is well done.

Also connected to a well made story in my opinion crafted with a mix of cut scenes which include real actors.

I like it very much.

It is a game with a learning curve.

Especially the survival and crew management part needs some time getting into it.

So make plenty saves in the start!

As for the combat stealth is a vital part of the game as you want to preserve ammunition which is costly and hard to get by.

So having long firefights depletes critical ammunition fast.

But again there are plenty options to remedy that:

Have ""ninjas"" with silent step ability paired with binocular soldiers to clear the map in stealth.

Or instead of having a prolonged firefight with enemies in trenches use your grenadier to lob a grenade to clear them out.

Or flank pinned enemies to make their cover invalid.

To those having respect for difficulty levels:

The game has quite a few options to tweak the difficulty. Even when already begun in game.

So if too hard you can tone down if you want.

But I would recommend going on ""normal"" preset difficulty.

It is very rewarding to get your people through.

:-)

I can only recommend the game.

One thing still:

Crew managwment is quite overwhelming as you get more people.

I took my time to note down on paper or word pad who certain experts in skills and profession are.

The crew menu gets crowded fast so that certainly helped me.",1701416571,1701417820,True,1,0,0.501329779624938965,0,True,False,False

On the other hand, melee is glitched,  friendly units fail to connect their takedowns, whether in stealth or not, even selecting units with a box doesn't work properly.

Picture this. Camp mission. I scout the area, locate the guards, sneak up and go for the kill. My guy runs up and... he glitch-clips with the enemy and gets stuck. Enemy realizes there is an epilepsy attack going on, so he runs, lighting fast, to the telegram station and starts inputting A FRICKING MORSE CODE. I order all my bayonetts to charge him down... but alas, his morse code is too fast. He sends a telegram before my guys manage to figure out which side of a knife is the pointy one. As a matter of fact, dude just bunny-hops out from the crowd of four combatants, and runs away unscatched. No stopping for this guy, no!

No worries, I start again! This time my guy makes the glitchless kill, but the other guard was too close and spotted the commotion! Ah, woe on me. So I order a bayonet charge on the two remaining foes... my guys run up... and they glitch. Both of them. And the enemies, too. Now I have four dudes from both sides just clipping through each other, stuck, and not able to kill.

It's like playing Commandos, but every time your Green Beret performs a silent kill, there is 50/50 chance he gets a seizure.

Have you ever heard the opinion that there are many modern programmers who have the training, but lack too much in critical thinking and creativity to make a decent work? This game is the epitome of that!

Frostpunk had all kinds of sound and graphical effects, like camera rotation blur or turning volume down with pause. Well, it worked, because it was an economy game, in which the village was arranged in a grid! But there you must constantly check your angles, and the blur effect only makes it difficult, laggy and you end up wrestling the game just for a good camera angle.

Men of War had vertical landscapes. Super tactical. Yay, let's add them, but don't actually implement them. Oh, what do you mean, a DEAD SPOT?! No such thing, especially for howitzers! Make them turn their missiles 180degrees if they have to! ... Don't even get me started on the fact, that you can actually SEE THROUGH MOUNTAINS with your binocular. This is how sloppy this is. The combat is actually taking place on a flat map, and the hills are just cosmetic, only adding to confusion. It makes me wonder if the devs actually enjoyed their game or is it more like some sort a lab rat maze.

Yeah, but who cares anyway? Just make the game look like the other game, without knowing what we are doing and why that other game was actually good! Stay tuned for the DLC!

- Give squads call signs instead of squad 1 squad 2 etc.

Stealth is always the first choice. You should assess what is important to you on the map, because you don't always have to loot everything because time is running out (cold/fuel). It's best to play act 1 and learn it.

If you have problems you should play normally. I wouldn't take easy as it makes the game a bit boring.

otherwise playful/storywise, something like frostpunk.

is it worth buying? Yes, but you should be prepared for a lot of frustration and headaches.

Finding any type of game or movie that is about 1880-1920 is very difficult.  You have the two obvious ones, Victoria series and All Quite on the Western Front.  So to get another new game set in this time period is amazing.  Let alone, have it set in the east and not be about France, England, Germany or US is ever better.  Even though this game isnt about WWI but instead about the Russian civil war is just the cherry ontop.  Amazing story to tell and so few people probably are aware that this story/event actually did happen.  With that outta the way, here is the game review.

Pros:
- Graphics 
- Story
- Train management 
- Combat
- So few bugs

Neg:
- repetitive
- Combat ( will discuss further why its good/bad)
-  UI

Lets start off with the negatives first.  The missions outside of combat ones are pretty much all the same.  Click some buttons and read some generic lines of text.  Unless your RNG is amazing, dont expect to find much food at lakes.  This can lead you to become a bit tired of the game and deff need to take breaks as it does get old after about 3 chapters .  There are some good quest/ txt to enjoy in these missions but they are very rare [spoiler]baba yaga story line[/spoiler].  The UI isnt terrible but I wouldnt call it great either.  Some more visuals would be nice, esp for troop temps.  I think it be neat if each cart had a thermometer on it telling you if the heat is needed or not.  The combat is like every other RTS squad base game and ill go into the pros in the next paragraph.  My only issues are these 2 which is your troops not going back into cover  when they first run to the location or after theyve done someother animation thats not shooting ( like throwing a nade and such).  The other issue is not being able to easily click downed troops to heal them.  Ive lost 1 grenadier( my highest ranked solider lvl5) cause I thought I clicked on him to be healed but didnt and he bleed out.  Besides those two negatives, its pretty solid.  Alot like CoH games.

My fav things about the game are the graphics.  I do wish we had female graphics ( if we do, they are very hard to tell).  Love seeing my train progress from being a shit hole into a death machine.  Its the little things like the flags or the troops kicking it back.  Those little animations make a worlds difference and hope you add more in the near future.  Maybe allow us to add some customization to the train!.  The story is great, on par with Expedition: Rome on a solid story.  Im only at chapter 4 or 5 so still not to far into the game.  Really enjoying how each chapter has its own flavor.  I dont want to spoil much but this timed chapter is a real pain in my ass ( i wanna stop at everything but cant!).  Train management is blast.  Its very unique but also familiar if you've played these type of games before.  I would compare it to Expedition: Rome and Pathfinder WOTR for the map portion of the game.  The management is more in-depth then WOTR and you have more of a need to collect resources then you did in Expedition : Rome.  in the 20hr of game play, ive only ran into a few bugs.  The train flashes transparency if you pause it before the construction begins.  The train gets stuck and you just gotta go to a new screen and break what ever animation thats causing the freezing.  Nothing that has made me CTD and it seems rather optimized.  My PC fans are going into max drive like they do on cp2077.  Combat, is nothing special but it is fun.  The best part about it is the bayonet charge.  When in doubt always stab as person.  They can be behind 2 enemy lines, just rush in and stab em.  It never fails unless the AI have a machine gun.  Machine guns will kill you.  

All in all, great game.  Love the setting and hope that we get more games based in this time period.  Ive never wanted to own a train and mount canons on it more then I do now.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys CoH combat and also has fantastic story telling and a rewarding management system.",1701374948,1701374948,True,14,0,0.618604779243469238,0,True,False,False

If seeking mostly combat, this may not be your thing.  Logistics is the key. Number crunching, planning, and efficiency will get you further than shooting skills and trying to race thru in my opinion.

If you're into or prefer games like Captain of Industry, Factorio, and Satisfactory (like myself), this is well worth a try. While no belts, pipes, or factory building, those fundamentals come in handy and are put to the test. 

100+ hours went into the demo and found more ways to squeeze blood from a turnip every time.  The full game is proving even better.  Now well past Penza, it's not getting any easier. All that time on the demo was not in vain.

While simple to control, there is a steep learning curve to finding and figuring out everything and how it all interacts.  Fortunately, it's very easy to pause (space bar) and can also be set to auto pause anytime anything potentially important happens.    

Zero game play/computer performance issues with graphics set on max on this or the demo with a year old quality brand mid level gaming computer.

The story and detail are incredible.  The soldiers  become ""real"". All have a unique personality and set of skills that matter greatly.

Because this game fu*ks you in the ass, thus the one time use dildo. 
Lube optional.

Written all English and NOT like the video. There is no English audio.  They say there is, ok, in the video only. NOT in the game, its written English.
They aim of the troops is horrible.

It kills the immersive nature to listen to Russian and try to read English, while figuring out what to do/fight while being distracted by Russian audio which I do not understand most of it as they speak fluent Russian too fast to understand.

The video made me to believe that it would be in English as well. They did not spend the voice overs for English which is a shame but made a video depict English? If they can make a video in English, the game should be as well for English sales for the game immersion.

Resources are scarce, but an on-the-fly difficulty adjustment means for those of you afraid of losing like myself, this game can be prevented from giving you gray hair; but you'll always be working hard to scrounge up something to get your train just a few towns further down the line.

The visuals are nice and watching your train roll through the country is quite fun. The voices are well done and the story of having to traverse the entirety of Russia to get home is a compelling one.

Some reviews have mentioned wonky unit actions during RTS segments, and that it worsens as the game goes on. I have encountered one or two strange moments for sure, but I was able to salvage the moment. Some balance patches and bugfixes for these niche moments may be in order.

Strangely enough, every item has the same range unless you count actions, so snipers have the same range as a handgun medic. Odd. I'd like to see that change.

Last Train Home is not a game I have completed. But, so far, I am enjoying it quite a lot, and have no major complaints other than niche moments where balancing or weird unit behavior have broken immersion.

The gameplay blends perfectly ingredients from different strategy branches: it's a real time strategy when on the ground exploring, looting and approaching enemies; it's a real time tactics while in battle, due to the tactical pause and the possibility to make really stealth kills; and it's also a resources/squad management inside the train. 

Furthermore, both the art concept and the immersive sound are beautifully crafted. Everything is wrapped by a captivating storytelling, which can add another layer for those who like strategy RPG's too.

The game is highly customizable to your liking and pretty much everything from the enemy difficulty to resource management can be adjusted to your liking. The voice acting is very authentic for all three languages involved. 

That being said. naming your narrator thr ""Historian"" and then starting the first hour of the game demonizing the soviets for wanting to disarm you when you started this whole conflict by starting an armed assault on Hungarian POW's and then storming a Soviet headquarters after some of your men got arrested is just plain silly.

Last Train home is just the thing if you like strategy games and micromanagement games.

I have already invested 12 hours in the game and am very satisfied. But be prepared for difficult tasks to solve. In my case, for example, I thought a doctor's trolley would be an advantage, as the doctor's fees are very expensive. After the purchase was made, however, I ran out of ammunition, which was a lingering mistake.  I couldn't use it to loot the coal mine, which froze everyone in Siberia.

This game feels like a combination of Men of War, This War of Mine, Oregon Trail, and a hint of Banner Saga. It's hard to say who exactly will like this game, it's a strategy RPG, with hints of colony simulator. But instead of a house like This War of Mine you get a train. 

You have Morale, Health, Perks, and training for your people, and I like the text influenced by personality perks in the story events. Training (basically just xp gain) seems to occur by having people assigned to a post or going out into the world as a squad. 

I think the overall weakest aspect of the game is the combat mechanics and stealth. You can sneak, hide in a bush, stab a guard, rinse and repeat. They dont seem to get alerted to dead bodies. I am comparing this to Men of War, Commandos, or other top down squad management strategy games. In comparison to most of those games, this game's combat is avg. In comparison to Men of War, I would have to say it's subpar. I know Bolsheviks drank a lot but I highly doubt they were THAT inept. 

I personally did not like the option to fail the game by morale, so I compensated by removing the downed state for my men so they insta-die. And I have to admit my heart skips a beat when my precious cook that's also a machine gunner's health gets too low. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty I can select, and the game doesnt feel overly challenging.

AND they're placed at the final leg of the mission meaning I'm just getting torn apart over and over while redoing the whole fucking mission nonstop.

Also, because of this, other gameplay issues I didn't notice before are cropping up. Hitting restart mission doesn't 'restart mission,' it just takes you back to the last leg of the world map, meaning you have to go through the entire squad building and equipment phase over and over again. I was microing a guy in stealth trying to take out an enemy and a cinematic triggered, leaving my camera centered off my dude and he got torn apart before I could figure out what's going on.

I don't know how my experience could be so different between the demo and full release, but the finished product isn't worth my time.

I'll probably buy the game again at a bigger discount, but I already have an equally janky squad based tactical game (Aliens: Dark Descent) that doesn't respect my time.

Combat is fun, stealth not so much it can get tedious and I feel like there is not enough depth to the stealth system to keep the stealth fresh for longer periods of time. Train/soldier management is fun aswell, but I feel like UI leaves something to be desired, finding out which of your soldiers is occupied with what requires you to hover above specific place in UI to show you the information, it gets bit annoying after while.

I have played about 5 hours and I have made it past chapter 2 with plenty to go, so I expect the game length to be beyond satisfactory. 

Voice acting (playing in Czech mind you and somehow I have hunch this might not be the case for english version) is mixed bag. Intonation during mission briefings seems to change alot for no reason as if the voice lines are stitched together. Some lines in missions to me sound like they are from a b-movie and are overacted, but that might be deliberate choice. 

Other than gameplay I have to mention the art/artwork and great story/premise of the game. The game itself oozes love for the subject matter and you can tell developers put their passion in making this. 

Even though I may seem critical in my review I wholeheartedly recommend the game, it is indeed something special even though it is not perfect.

1 Major letdown:

The tactical combat. Its really awful imo, especially after chapter 1 in which it was fine. The stealth system doesn't really work, the red army camp in chapter 2 is a massive mess (you can place explosives to blow up trucks but whoever you instruct wont move after placing explosives blowing themselves up). It feels very janky. F5 is probably my most used button due to very strange controlled unit behavior. You can't capture objectives while stealthed - so you need to unstealth, but there isn't a hold fire button, so one of your guys might randomly start shooting at some distant enemy. Its just weird.

1 large issue: The train UI/UX. You can't sort by perks which becomes problematic. The whole assigning people to various tasks without seeing what they are actually good at unless you click into their portrait screen is quite frustrating. I'd love to be able to let an off duty soldier work on a train upgrade - is this possible? No - you need to remove them from their squad, and even more annoyingly, put them back after the upgrade is complete - otherwise they'll sit in that upgrade slot for all time. Workers assigned to upgrade a train part will stay assigned even when it completes. Its micro management to a really silly degree.

The redeeming feature: If you manage to get to terms with how to manage the train, the concept and train management parts are actually quite fun and novel.

And yet I can't bring myself to like it. What follows is my longest review to date and one big rant, you've been warned.

TLDR Stategy layer 7/10, tactical layer 0/10 = 3.5/10 in total, just let me skip the combat

The good
Train management, artstyle and the map

The bad
[u] SHALLOW tactical layer [/u]: The game wants you to stealth (cause injuries and using ammo is bad) and so despite the combat being good (although it would seem that directional cover is not working cause a soldier wide open to a flank is somehow dodging every shot) you are practically forced to stealth. Which revolves around sitting in a bush and stabbing every bypasser. The characters lack any stealth abilities and AI is extremely unaware, not that there is anything to be aware of cause I guess legionnaires send every dead enemy to the other dimension leaving no body behind. So instead of fun combat you are left with a half-baked chore of a system. (If you want tactics with guns may I suggest Partisans 1941 stealth there is WAY better)

[u] Voice acting [/u]: Bit of a mixed bag: Czechs are voiced ok-good, enemies might have as well been voiced by google translate

[u] Story [/u]: I love the Legion and hate the reds, yet even for me the game was so black and white that it seems like an understatement. Cause LITERALLY every Russian you meet is either a grieveng mother/grandma or the most punch-able person ever, while the Czechs might as well be saints. Like I get it, CURRENT EVENTS, but it's a history game ffs.

[u] Story direction [/u]: The game has no idea what to be, it tries to show that it's gritty and dark with it's plot, yet missions are written with jokes and banter straight out of a B-movie. It honestly just feels in bad taste.

[u] Characters [/u]: Mixed point again: love the backstories and portraits, but can't bring myself to care, which I really expected from this game. There are too many characters with them being different in stats and perks only.  I get the necessity for scale so can't really blame the devs here.

[u] UX/UI [/u]: Almost forgot and I really can't. The game has perks that are needed for events, right? So you should make a squad with people with these perks, right? So it should be EASY to find them, right? WRONG, you have to click through EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR SOLDIERS TO FIND THE PERKS YOU NEED, WHY? (almost lost my cool)

[u] 2 hour refund [/u]: Now I don't want to say it's on purpose but you are properly introduced to stealth around 2+ hours into the game and it REALLY makes me think

[b] If you read this far [/b] first of all thanks, second the game has potential but the stuff above is so fundamentally buggered there is no hope :(

PS Steam pls be merciful and give me a refund

You basically have an overworld strategic map where your train travels from station to station and you manage supplies and ammo(per type, pistol, rifle and machinegun). The tactical level is where you control your specialised soldiers(medic, sniper etc) and use their skills to complete objectives.
Pro: looks nice, many mechanics, in deepth rpg systems where soldiers have stats,perks and consumables, big maps to do main and secondary missions, VERY COOL voice acting in 3 languages.
Cons: day 1 cut content dlc, performance issues of many many kinds, seems very complex but gets a little shallow the more you play, might have some political bias.

Let's make this simple.

Does it look good? Play good? Sound good? Run good? Feel good? Read good?
Yes.
There. Happy?
no?
Okay then.

The game has pretty good graphics even on medium settings. The voice acting and sound effects are awesome. THe gameplay is intuitive, intense, immersive and massive. There's so much to do and experience and play around with here which makes it engaging and fun. 

Then you've got the length of time, the dialogue options, the choices you can make, the train you can customize along with troops. Plus the managing of your train and troops. Plus the real time strategy of combat missions where you control a squad of soldiers with cover mechanics, skills, levels, classes, gear all while trying to scavenge for resources for your train.
The pricetag might be a bit much though, it's tutorial isn't very good and the U.I. is kinda annoying. But everything else here is pretty awesome.

BUT the main game is missing some crutial parts needed in the main game that where available on the demo.  the main example.  the squads button is missing in the main game meaning its now impossible for you to alter or disband your squads.  and some of the wording was defo not checked.  but being pedantic but the word BREAKS is not the correct word to use for the replacement of the word BRAKES.  simple English really. ill always nit pick and find these little details but its the little details that mean the most into a game.,1701189901,1701189901,True,6,0,0.51393967866897583,0,True,False,False

It's very clear that the devs and especially the art/sound team care deeply about their game. I'm very impressed by the details and systems. The game can be a little micro heavy at times, but I enjoy it and it's a relaxing way to play. Definitely worth it, especially with the launch sale.",1701183058,1701183058,True,48,0,0.692094802856445313,0,True,False,False
