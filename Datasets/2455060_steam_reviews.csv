5 hours into the game and I'm so bored with it.  Honestly?  I was bored with it around 3 hours in.  But I was hoping it would change at the higher difficulties.  (spoilers: it doesn't)
Made it to difficulty 90+ and if I wasn't getting one shot, I was one shotting them.  Legitimately, there is so much chaos that dodging the guys who spawn in already attacking is stupid.  

The game itself is SHALLOW.  Within two runs I had everything I could unlock, unlocked.  Weapons / Skins / 85-90% of the ""rogue like"" side was maxed out.  That was only a hour into the game.

You could 100% remove the holy water ecchi scenes and it wouldn't affect a damn thing.  It's literally only there to tease you and give you short bouts of weirdly awkward scenes between you and the Valkyries just to change our your skin,... which does nothing.  Honestly, it does ZERO things.  No stat changes and you can barely even see your character half the time so the concept of skins is silly.

Weapons were interesting,... until you tried them.  Axe is boring and slow, even with the fast speed upgrades (also feels really weak), gungir is lacking in every way shape and form.  Feels slow, short and weak.  The default blade is a solid choice, but then you get the katana.  I never changed my weapon once I used it.  It's speed and damage incarnate.  It's silly.

Once you play a single run of the game,... you've played the game.  Every aspect is exactly the same in later difficulties short of adding random modifiers to each run.  That's shallow as hell.


Now maps were cool looking at first.  Then you realize that in most of the maps 90% of what you see, you can't interact with and actually feels more like a burden than the small maps.  Huge HUGE maps, with a barrier blocking you from exploring them.  Then enemies will spawn on the complete other side of the level making you run for a solid 20-30 seconds just to meet them and either one shot them or otherwise, then they spawn on the OTHER side again.  IT IS A HORRIBLE DESIGN CHOICE.

For the price?  I can't recommend it.  I would maybe pick it up at like $5 - $9max.  Because once you play a few rounds, you'll never load it again.",1704837042,1704837042,False,9,1,0.60602867603302002,0,True,False,False

""I'm an old warrior warming myself by the fire.

The nostalgic sights I enjoyed in my youth taken away by tyrannical kings.

Trials Of Taboo is one of my last impulsive purchases of the year. An affordable rogue-lite-gem that draws from Norse mythology yet often fumbles with incorrect references and improper mismatched names within the Nordic pantheon. Flawed translation aside, the gameplay includes graceful mobility as well and a satisfying ""clang"" when beating up this barren world's unfriendly wild-life into piles of scrap metal! (Mechanoid creatures resembling everything from basic animals to frightening behemoths.) Indeed,playing this will give you flashes of Nier Automata and Horizon Zero Dawn only it was created in a humbler forge under much more limited conditions.

Yet there is a deceptive amount of complexity here. A literal baker's dozen of attack combinations,skills,spells,buffs,and chained together synergies! You can then move on to purchase new weapons and even take on the appearance of any battle-maiden you maxed out your affinity with. All of the aforementioned things require their own kind of currency which you acquire from slaying both enemy mobs and bosses alike. 

Beyond that it follows the rogue-lite blue print. You are teleported to multiple boxed-in monster closets and ""fight on"" until you die. Over the course of each accumulative reincarnation you carry over some of your former strength whilst the challenge evens out further due to muscle memory and recognizing patterns.  

Once you master the existential flow of the whole package it is possible to complete the campaign in roughly 2 or so hours. 

As expected, gamers are encouraged to try different builds,move on to harder difficulties,and attempt new challenges. If you are a rogue-lite affreciando you will not have a problem with this but those of us that appreciate rpgs and even higher budget hack n slashers could end up feeling a bit short changed. (Even at the very forgivable price point of around 14.99)

Things I liked

+ Props for the unabashed fan service. Even mature adults comfortable in their own skins appreciate idealized and exaggerated depictions of physical beauty. (In this specific case especially the ladies!)

+Combat and character building is fun!

+Surprisingly fantastic art assets.

+World manages to be barren and unexpectedly fascinating simultaneously. Very much a ""liminal spaces"" vibe with some high-concept-sci-fi-set-pieces thrown in for good measure. Style is on point!

+Music compliments the general theme.

+Hub-world is easy to navigate

+The developer Luna-noodle handling public relations seems responsive,friendly,and eager to answer questions!

+Bug I originally listed as a negative seems to have been fixed. Now that's sterling-silver-service!

+The more I played the more I realized Taboo Trial is deceptively content-rich. Not every feature,modifier,quest,and every upgrade-station is available to you right away. To get the best results I suggest maxing out romances with all the girls then progressing thru higher numbered difficulties when it comes to consecutive play-thrus. It is at that juncture you will realize there's quite a few hidden goodies worth unveiling going forward!

-/+ Neutral

Each run is quite short,especially if you have a character build that melts down mobs of enemies in mere seconds! However,there are moments in our busy lives when that is all we want,a brisk arcade-like power-fantasy romp that doesn't overstay its' welcome. Still, depending on who you are you may still find this approach lacking or overly repetitive. 


Things I disliked


- While I'm not offended by the dialogue/narration as they are currently presented, ""true enthusiasts"" of Norse mythology will spot the translation errors immediately. Might want to fix that in future updates.

-Some DLC shenanigans with two side characters. Probably mostly for additional aesthetic enjoyment. Not fond of the practice but I don't hold it against a small-time dev team of four people for putting such offerings out there just to make a little extra cred.

Most people will probably get bored within 3-8 hours once they try all builds. For one evening of smashing buttons and watching everything die, it's probably worth it.

The main issue for me is how the dev thinks the balance should work. You have an op lifesteal, revive and you destroy everything within a few seconds so his only way to stop you is to just ramp up the damage for mobs on higher difficulties in the hope that they will oneshot you eventually. Which works of course, but it doesn't make the game feel better

Speaking of mobs, I think there are just too many of them. One run takes about 30-40 minutes and during that time you have to kill like a hundred if not more WAVES of mobs. While it's satisfying to test your build on something, after a couple of tries you just get tired of going through all of them every single time. And between wave 50 and wave 100 there isn't much difference from the player's perspective, everything dies just as quickly but you see more or higher damage numbers on the screen.

My old ""first impressions"" review can be read at the bottom[/i]

[b]Women of god become extremely horny over drinking holy water.[/b]
Taboo Trial is a short 3D action roguelike that you can complete (your first full run) in about 4 hours. I personally really liked the shorter length of the game, because it means each run you'll most likely be able to beat the boss that killed you last time.The English translation of the game is a bit rough in many places, but generally I had no trouble understanding what it was trying to say. The story is very basic at it's core, and anything beyond ""kill the boss to open the way to the next area"" is ultimately quite forgettable.

The steam page mentions ""partial controller support"", which basically boils down to: combat works perfectly fine, menus can be a bit stubborn to use, you can't rebind keys (you can rebind on keyboard, just not controller)

[b]Bosses[/b]
There are 8 bossfights in the game, but in reality it's 4 bosses with either different movesets or ""boss you've seen previously, but now there's two of them"" type situations. They aren't the flashiest fight on the market, nor the most memorable, but the movesets are decent enough fun (although some hitboxes could use adjustments)

[b]Spells/abilities[/b]
If my memory serves me right there are 5 or 6 ""spell"" type abilities in the game, most of them have a ""ability"" version (a button/key that you have to press to activate) and a ""passive"" version (smaller version of the same effect, has a chance to trigger through another action/ability)Most of them are decently strong, and if you get good upgrades with them you'll be able to melt bosses in the matter of seconds. 

[b]Weapons[/b]
There are only three in the game: greatsword, greataxe, and a spear. The latter two need to be unlocked with items that drop from first-time boss kills. They all play about the same in the beginning, they all have a light 3-attack chain and a heavy attack that costs energy. You can upgrade the light attack or completely change what the heavy attack does if you find the specific upgrade for them. 

[b]Playable Characters:[/b]
There are 7 playable ""characters"" in the game (the difference between them is only cosmetic, they all use the same weapons and upgrades), and you unlock them by giving them a specific boss drop item (Holy Water) three times. You can only gift one item between runs, even if you have more than one in your inventory, which seems like a bit of an odd restriction.Now, you as the player don't know these characters personally, but the moment you gift them holy water they're pretty much down to fuck on the spot, like full 0 to 100 on the horny scale within seconds. There isn't actual sex or nudity in the game, but the dialogue (and character illustrations that you get after the first gift) can be very very suggestive.

[b]Difficulty+ (New Game+)[/b]
After you beat the game once you'll unlock Difficulty+ options (up to +3 to begin with) that as far as I know go up to [i]at least[/i] +10. +3 is a small but noticeable difficulty increase from your first playthrough, you also need to add an extra modifier to your run, which adds either extra health and damage to enemies or environmental hazards that you need to be aware of. The higher the difficulty, the more modifiers you need to pick. You also get extra money and ""heart of spirit"" (used for permanent upgrades) on higher difficulties. 

[b]Visuals[/b]
The game takes norse mythology/aesthetics and sprinkles some shiny futurism and technology on top of it. If you're looking for a faithful retelling/use of norse mythology, this game isn't it. The game takes names of people, creatures and places from nordic myth but doesn't really connect them back to it in any meaningful way. Either way, I really like the environments of the game, especially the snowy areas in Chapter 2. Whoever in the team is behind the visuals of this game gets a thumbs up from me!

[b]Missing Content...?[/b]
Few of the loading screens show more organic-looking enemies, specifically some type of dragon and another giant lizard creature. They don't actually appear in the game, which is a shame. (unless they're some kind of secret Difficulty+10 endgame bosses but I kinda doubt that). I hope that they're some kind of content planned for the future, because they both look really cool and I want to fight them :(

[b]Performance[/b]
I have a RTX3060 and putting all the graphics settings to the highest drops the fps to around 20-30. The main culprit seems to be the Fog setting, changing it from High to Normal made the game run perfectly fine.A fair few people have also reported issues with lag and crashes, and there seems to currently be problems with certain AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards, I personally didn't encounter any of the former (besides the fog lag), but I'll still mention it here to make people aware that there is a possibility of performance-related problems!

------------------------------------
[b]OLD REVIEW [/b]

[i]This is a ""first impressions"" review about an hour into the game, since there aren't many reviews in english and I imagine people will be curious to know more than what the steam page tells them[/i]

Believe it or not I didn't come her for the anime waifu ass, as much as it seems to be center of advertisement. The character you start with did kind of gave me Nier Automata vibes, maybe it's the white hair [strike]and the anime waifu ass.[/strike] 
But what actually caught my attention and dragged me in was the mix of norse-inspired aesthetics and funky robot creatures, I had the money to spare so I gave it a shot. And... it's actually pretty decent!

I'm gonna be real, I was half-expecting this game to be a scam or something, I tried to look up info about the game and dev online before buying but found absolutely nothing (except a link to the official discord that had less than 10 members).

On first launch my antivirus gave a warning pop-up, which it eventually cleared after scanning the files. It's not a great start to launching a game, but I wasn't about to let that stop me. 
Once you press start the game immediately drops you to the first level and gives a brief combat tutorial. The best I can describe the gameplay loop is that it's Hades, almost identically, you move from room to room and pick rewards as you go, and bosses drop items that you can trade in for other stuff and permanent upgrades in the hub room.

Combat feels alright, reading enemy attacks and dodging in time can be a bit of a pain but I imagine it's one of those things that you'll get better at as you repeat the bosses over and over again. The skills you can pick on runs seem to have pretty good variety to them. I'm only a handful of runs deep at the point of writing this, and so far I've had a slightly different approach to combat each time, first run my skills were more focused on applying a damage-over-time debuff to enemies, and another time I was slapping enemies around with heavy attacks. Based on trailer footage there are plenty of abilities that I haven't even come across yet.

[b]TLDR:[/b] The game feels good to play for the most part and I really like the aesthetic they've gone with, I don't have any major complaints so far but we'll see if that changes as I get further into the game.",1690945856,1691256387,True,65,2,0.811626911163330078,7,True,False,False

A few days later and there have been meaningful QOL patches, and the game feels really, really good. You have an i-frame, up to 4 abilities, a light attack and a heavy attack that uses energy (gained by using your normal attack). The enemies have good tells, so you always know when to dodge. The rogue-like features mostly include random power up selections. After each battle you can ""pick a door"" and whatever the symbol is is what your reward will be. 

The game isn't very long but has 20(!?!) difficulty modifiers, and I suspect the true ending is locked behind one of them. The modifiers are typically ""shops get more expensive"", or, ""enemy gets X amount of more HP/damage"". 

I'd say this is worth the purchase if you like to hack and slash and like to play multiple difficulties. I would have preferred new enemies with new attack patterns to learn how to dodge instead of the incremental % modifiers, but such is life.",1691201584,1691201584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is fun, game-play loop feels fun but might get repetitive though it hasn't for me, and generally fun to try different builds, the graphics is pretty decent too. 

The 'sexy character' design scheme isn't really my cup of tea, nonetheless, they are designed well (outside of one of the characters' clothes clipping through her leg).

And lastly, the game seems to currently be lacking a bit of polish - if you miss instructions its a bit hard to gather your bearings.",1691167424,1691167424,True,6,1,0.574677348136901855,0,True,False,False
