You can learn engineering and design vehicles. You will also be frustrated when the Devs change over things making your existing work disabled needing tune ups and reworks.

Devs are honestly prone to major screw ups on almost every major feature release. ITs like they don't play their own game just tinker up a few things. New engines burst into flames is one.

The core gamplay of what to do with the vehicles had been largely decayed and in some cases reduced since release. Mission Editor went from many were using it to a new complex systems that also made all the 100s of things useless.

The creativity of what you can do in this game is outstanding and the possibilities are endless. I love this game so much and this game brings me joy. This game takes quite a lot of time to learn but once you learn it it's quite fun :D While there are tons of bugs especially with multiplayer overall it's a fantastic game. The only major downside is that with the three dlcs that are included with this game, while you don't have to buy them, the items that are included in with the dlcs are in the base game. but you can't use them until you buy the dlc for those items. The items are staring at your face waiting to be used but yet there is still a money wall between you and assessing those items. I wish the game didn't have the dlcs items if you didn't have the dlc for them though.

During this ""q&a,"" multiple contradictions were made, which shows that the developers are only really ""updating"" in order to make it seem like it's playable, and they still support it. However, if you've played it before, even before the space dlc came out, you'll realize that it's only gone downhill. However, this game was alright when the weapons DLC came out, but a bit after that, it went downhill, and it's become an unplayable, buggy mess. It's about as bad as when it was in early access; it's early access was buggy, but the full release didn't change much, if anything. Playing with friends is almost impossible due to the lag, desynch, and overall very poor optimization of the game. I like how advanced and detailed you can get, but you need an advanced understanding of Lua to make anything. Mind you, in this recent so-called ""q&a,"" they've said they don't want to fix certain bugs because it'll break players creations. The Q&A has basically said we don't want to work on this anymore. They don't want to add new blocks to a building game. And major updates are going to become smaller, they said. Meaning major updates aren't going to be major anymore. The most recent one added two blocks, a fishing rod, and a vacuum. That's it. That's all, nothing more. I would recommend against buying. They won't listen to you, and they won't fix the game. 

TLDR: Don't buy; developers are abandoning their game, making excuses that contradict themselves, and it's buggy as hell to the point where it's unplayable; they are even lying in a pre-recorded stream.",1708636840,1708636967,False,21,3,0.658008873462677002,7,True,False,False

Not to many bugs currently after space DLC and v1.0 there were many but it seems like those are mostly gone. 

Player build wonderful things with this game the only thing is that if you wanted to do the rescuing portion of the game do it with a friend its way better. There are only so many missions though. The devs have so much request from the community that it's hard to manage what everyone wants.

If you just wanna duck off with to workshop creations and fly planes and stuff it's really fun.

This game has a very steep learning curve especially with microcontrollers and LUA it may seem easy but it's quite difficult to learn once you learn it is really easy to build stuff but the learning takes ~400 hours.

The ui is lovely!

Thing is, this time they bloody nailed it.

Seriously, this feels as much like fishing as I think a video game can. The only way they could do better would be to drag me to a boat, toss a rod and tackle box in after me, and launch me into the ocean. If I were gonna be a fault finder, I'd say the casting's just a little bit off, but for them to get it that close is pretty impressive.

Aaaand, to my surprise, they've fixed everything I can think of that they broke in the space update and I think I like the way it works now even better. I'm still not gonna buy the space update, because this is not a space game and to try to put space into it was just weird, but the base game and the other DLC, I'm pretty happy with right now.",1708563482,1708563482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

what i would like to have added are more types of wedges like round and those scoop shaped ones and their parts just like the current wedges got. 

But by far the biggest problem personally for me is that the map is always the same. just imagine if people could make their own maps like in Scrap Mechanic or we would at least get more maps like vehicle themed. Cities for trains, then 1 big city for cars trucks etc and then just an ocean for ships with some mountains like World of Warships.

please add custom maps. its work but i am pretty sure it would raise the sells again if we can have custom maps, yes aside from the known issues that do get fixed. Good job on that btw c:

I come from a background of using a ton of survival crafting games, The game UI here seems so non-intuitive and and the tutorials ingame are non existent. Be prepared to go study external youtube tutorials for a while to be able to learn how not just to learn the game, but how to control it. External Youtube videos are normally a good thing when it comes to gameplay / builds etc. But when you have to watch one to simply learn how to navigate the build menu with its non industry standard control options.. its frustrating and makes you ask the question ""But Why!?"" Overall disappointed, as I found as a new player i experienced more frustration at control methods rather than learning the games mechanics. I have spent more time watching youtube about this game than my past 2 hours ingame.

Ingredients:

1 cup (225g) unsalted butter
1 and 1/4 cups (250g) granulated sugar
1 cup (200g) packed light brown sugar
4 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour
3/4 cup (90g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup (175g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line a 9x13 inch (23x33cm) baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides for easy removal.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, remove from heat and stir in both granulated sugar and brown sugar until well combined. Let the mixture cool slightly.

Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, into the sugar-butter mixture until fully incorporated. Stir in the vanilla extract.

In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Fold in the chocolate chips or chunks until evenly distributed throughout the batter.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly using a spatula.

Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake, as you want the brownies to be fudgy.

Once done, remove the pan from the oven and allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.

Once cooled, lift the brownies out of the pan using the parchment paper overhang and transfer them to a cutting board. Cut into squares or rectangles and serve.

Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate brownies!",1682747773,1708382080,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Garry's mod with wiremod has an incredibly more powerfull and compact microcontroller system, and the way the physics engine works make landing gear very very irritating to get to work properly, one would expect a physics game from the late 2010 to not have the same issues as one from the mid 2000, especially since other physics games have resolved that issue.

But the cherry on the cake is that they allow you to use the DLC blocks, and you don't know if they are DLC blocks or not, or blocks added during an update, and if these are DLC blocks, they won't work.
You can spend 2 weeks making a vehicle, just to discover once ""finished"" that it will not work for it relies on DLC blocks.
Submarines for example can't be made as good as they used to without the space DLC because the Electrolyser is part of the space DLC, but that DLC also added compressed air tanks, are they DLC too ? Is hydrogen gas DLC ? is that why I can't make a blimp?

But i don't recommend Stormworks due to its updates for the community, The Space DLC is good but it doesn't feel right, The Natural Disasters update was good, Tho it also didn't feel that fun, There was also the fishing DLC that came out lately but i haven't checked it out yet, Now the Weapons DLC is what i want to talk about, When the weapons DLC came out it was the greatest thing i imaged but it soon lost that happiness, There wasn't alot of features. It offered 4 guns, SMG, Rifle, Pistol, and speargun ( Including the Ammo For All The Guns And Implacement Weapons ) , It also offered  2 explosives, C4, and Grenades. Besides that it offered 7 implacement guns. In my opinion the Weapons DLC offered little, The devs probably could of made more weapons, Including implacement guns, More explosives/gear, And more weapon features. I think that the devs didn't really put that much effort into making the Weapons DLC, I'm not saying that all updates don't have effort put into them, like the Space DLC and the Natural Disaster DLC had tons of effort put into them, They just don't feel right [u] To Me [/u]. In conclusion Stormworks is a great game, but i just feel like the Weapons DLC could of been way bigger and that the Weapons DLC we were givin is just kind of dull.

Bug fix requests:
- Buoyancy of large ships is unrealistically low.
- Whenever you take your vehicle back to the workbench via the map, it results in an infinite loading bug.
- Spawning a ship containing pumps will result in a short audio bug where are the pumps are on (which is really loud of course).
- The boilers are now maxed to 2.5 bars and do not explode anymore.
- The fluid flow is unrealistic and it takes ages for a space to get filled with water. Even when adding a gas escape valve. Literally spawning a cube with the bottom being a hatc, the cube takes 30 minutes to fill or even when the top is opened.

Being a open world sandbox with a extremely active modding community and an even more active developer, Geometa, the possibilities are endless! Being an avid lover of physics based sandbox games, Stormworks has earned a place in my heart with the dynamic weather, natural disasters, non repetitive missions, and a vast world on a seed style generation format. The expansion packs, while not necessary, do add a lot to the game including but not limited to space travel, weapons, and other features I have yet to even discover. The modding community, I can say without a doubt, is the most active and influential part of this game and, even though the procedure might be a bit complicated [Error], the developers give every tool and necessary resource to create and publish very detailed mods from ships and aircraft to artillery and much much more. I understand the game might not be for everybody, and the actual gameplay might feel bland to some, but for the select audience, this game has broken boundaries of addictive that I cannot even put into words.

Stormworks: Build and Rescue stands out as one of the top three games I've ever played, primarily due to its unparalleled sandbox experience and the limitless possibilities it offers for creativity and exploration. From the moment I delved into the world of Stormworks, I found myself immersed in a vast ocean of opportunities, where the only limit was my imagination.

At its core, Stormworks is a game that empowers players to become engineers, designers, and captains of their own creations. Whether constructing intricate vehicles or embarking on daring rescue missions, every moment in Stormworks feels like a journey of discovery and excitement. The game seamlessly blends elements of simulation, crafting, and exploration, creating a unique and captivating gameplay experience.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Stormworks is its robust building mechanics. The game provides players with a wide array of modular components, allowing them to design everything from simple boats to complex aircraft and submarines. The level of detail and customization available is staggering, with players able to fine-tune every aspect of their creations, from engine performance to aesthetic design. This freedom to experiment and iterate fosters a sense of ownership and pride in every vehicle I build.

Furthermore, Stormworks' dynamic weather and physics systems add an extra layer of challenge and immersion to the gameplay. Navigating treacherous seas or soaring through stormy skies requires careful planning and skillful piloting, making each journey feel like a thrilling adventure. The game's realistic physics engine also ensures that every action has consequences, whether it's the impact of waves on a ship's hull or the aerodynamic forces affecting an aircraft's flight path.

Beyond its building and simulation mechanics, Stormworks offers a wealth of content and activities to engage in. From completing challenging rescue missions to exploring the vast open world, there's always something new to discover and experience. The game's active community of players also contributes to its longevity, with a constant stream of user-generated content, mods, and multiplayer experiences to enjoy.

In conclusion, Stormworks: Build and Rescue is more than just a game; it's a playground of endless possibilities and excitement. Its deep building mechanics, dynamic gameplay, and vibrant community make it a standout title in the world of sandbox gaming. For me, Stormworks ranks among the top three games I've ever played, and I look forward to countless more hours of adventure on the high seas and in the skies.



VERY GOOD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1707968345,1707968345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
573090,100856601,76561197967131061,0,33,730,0,501,1641179756,"tl;dr : A very detailed physics simulator, with a search-and-rescue game played within. 
You can create *amazing* vehicles, it is truly unrivaled in this. Unfortunately the physics gets slower with every block and link built into your designs, to a point where multiplayer is often not feasible, and single-player only if you are patient to tolerate playing with varying input delay.

In single-player the physics calculations for seemingly simple things will cause the game to slow down. Most vehicles over 10m x 5m will begin to experience slowdown. When the weather makes the waves choppy. If there's multiple vehicles in close proximity. In the scope of Build & Rescue, but the Rescue part often gets mired down heavily by build physics.

Here's hoping that with the latest attention and success of their recent ""Search & Destroy"" weapons DLC, the Devs will have time and resource to focus 2:1 on game optimization. Make some more assumptions in the physics and logic to cut corners but pass approximate values faster. At this point multiplayer is rarely functional with the severity of lag, as well for the most active/computational single player moments where precise control is vital. I would hope not to see Stormworks this way indefinitely!
 
With that being stated, it should also be recognized that Stormworks has created a rather *incredible* build system. Combustion engines, batteries, gearboxes, transmissions, fuel lines, electronic controls (PID, Microcontrollers), actuators, landing gear, rescue helicopters with autostabilization and harness winches, nuclear powered submarines with GPS-directed cruise missles with live camera feed, rock-hopping trucks and buggies with miles of road and terrain to roam, humble pontoon boats, lawnmowers, even mechs and airships. The maniacs of the Stormworks community embrace the lag, and make impressive designs for many to enjoy...with lag.

If a design is minimalist enough it can be pretty smooth in single player, but there is a low threshold/count for components to induce slowdown, in addition to environmental activity. Great ideas being demonstrated in Stormworks, but the execution slows them all down.
I would change my mind if they made an optimization-pass which improved these issues.
(Case in point : 2/18/2020 Update News - ""This week we have been made aware of some networking issues caused by the new physics based fish system"")

If you are a die-hard building and simulation enthusiast, you will [i]love[/i] this game.
Otherwise, you will likely be disappointed.

mainly due to extremely thin water 

 this absolutely messes with the buoyancy if you want to build a sea plane or any boat,  the hull will have to be much deeper making the boat much slower and harder if not impossible to take off with a sea plane 

Also for some reason the game doesn't think air is buoyant so if your creation isnt enclosed on spawn then it will sink like a stone. This is extremely infuriating if you cannot find the opening causing you creation to sink and you can spend a vey long time to find it. Its not fun

Of my 16 hours playing at least 14 of them were spent just on watching tutorials with the game open so I could follow along and do exactly as they did. It may just be a skill issue but my brain gets extremely confused when they start talking about logic and stuff.

If you like a challenge and are really interested in the all of the nitty gritty of building stuff, from the most basic stuff to the really advanced stuff then I would highly recommend this game. But if you are the casual gamer that thinks you'll just boot it up, make a boat/car/plane from scratch and be on your merry way 2 hours into the game then I can't recommend this because it won't happen.

You can go anywhere on a large map and drive any ship you can make or find in the workshop, issue is that it is very hard to actually build your own ships and drive complicated ships. I don't mind this, as it is supposed to be a ""realistic"" game, and maintaining a ship is not easy. However, the game developers try to appeal to casual players at the same time and this is my issue. Stormworks is a complex and hard game that unnecessarily limits itself due to developers. Not a fan of Halloween? Too bad for you, you have to spend 10 days having unnecessary stuff thrown at you, such as an axe murderer, blood, cemetaries, red-eyed sharks, creepy sounds, etc. Why the heck do I have to deal with such childish and unrealistic stuff in a game that is trying to simulate search and rescue missions in realistic ships. I just wish we had the ability to turn off Halloween.  And then they name terminals and buildings after YouTubers whose main audience is children to promote the game, there is no way to change those names, it just seems desperate. I mean no disrespect to the YouTubers, it's just the devs was desperate enough to put their names into the game.
I liked the addition of the weapons DLC, I can finally drive warships, however, I did not pay for whatever in the world ""undead survival"" is, now this game and DLC is just ""Search and destroy Zombies"".
In conclusion, I don't like the devs' attitude of forcing others to accept their unnecessary gimmicks in a game, I paid for a game that allows me to drive ships, planes, etc, in realistic weather, not for zombies and Santa Claus. Allowing the option to disable ""events"" and ""gimmicks"", would instantly change my mind.
Here is my opinion, the developer should put older versions of the game, like Paradox does, on open betas, and let you choose whether you want the Halloween update in the game or not, it's not that much to ask.
The game's features are more than enough already, just fix bugs and performance, no reason to add stupid zombies to the game!

Edit 2/2024: I'm sorry but I really really dislike the developers of this game. They are rude, passive aggressive, refuse to listen to the community, and really can't handle criticism. When people complain about bugs due to their horrible anti-cheat, the developer goes through their system (not my words) using their anti-cheat and then bans the person from playing the base game which they paid for because they ""allegedly pirated"" the DLC.
The game honestly is fine as long as this dev never touches it again. I just cannot support such developers and I won't buy any DLCs from these cheapskates. I'm perfectly content with the base game. Looks like the developer has learned from the school of Chris Roberts with all the feature creep, bugs and attitudes towards the community and the catering to ""whales"" in this case youtubers.",1666418929,1707575802,False,4,1,0.544626593589782715,0,True,False,False

Stormworks: Build and Spend Hundreds of hours trying to figure out how to build a simple vehicle.

Stormworks has lots of scope for creativity, but is very fiddly and difficult to make anything work nicely. It is incredibly difficult to actually build a working, useful vehicle for the missions. 

The missions themselves also have basically no contextual value to them, If you build a helicopter you might get underwater rescue missions, or right after starting the game on an island and building a small boat, I've been asked to travel onto dry land to put out a land-based forest fire.

The size of the world is immense and due to the difficulty of perfecting a vehicle you may find your aircraft just gets struck by lightning, all the power goes out, and you fall in the ocean, or your vehicle isn't fuel efficient enough and you've spent a full real-time hour travelling towards the mission only to run out of fuel.

Normally this isn't an issue with games, but the time taken to discover issues is compounded on top of the other issues with the game that makes it just a very frustrating experience.

For at least the last 10 times I've launched this game, I've started a project to build a vehicle, only go give up after getting bored because it takes longer to try and wire up vehicle logic or troubleshoot an engine than actually building and designing the vehicle itself.

On top of all of these gripes, the developers don't seem to really care very much about issues, streamlining or enriching existing content and have been simply churning out DLC or features that do nothing for the original core concept of the game.

I wanted to do missions to rescue people, but now apparently I can shoot guns, go to space and now go fishing. Great... /s

The problem is that the campaign for this game is aimless and directionless and the gameplay loop gets very boring after only a few hours, and the progression path is murky and unclear. It's so short on content outside the build menu that it feels early access still but this is a fully released game with multiple DLC.

Just look at the fuel system as an example in the campaign if your starting base runs out of fuel you have to buy fuel and shuttle it to your base to keep it in operation. A process that can be monotonous and repetitive quickly, and i had only reached the point were i had been operating a single small helicopter for a few hours. Now consider that this game advertises building a coast guard rescue service in the campaign with boats, ships, planes, helicopters and more. The amount of fuel shuttling you have to do to keep all that stocked is never considered. A quick look around the internet shows that most players recommend going into game files and edit the bases fuel to be not be a problem.",1707452848,1707452848,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After that came a huge desert island, mining, and oil drilling, which again seems out of place. And can you guess what they added next? outer space... what does flying to the moon have to do with being a coast guard? I mean... I guess I could see rescuing a stranded astronaut or smth, but again it just doesn't fit. It's one thing to finish an aspect of the game and move onto the next, but i feel like they haven't even finished the original part of the game.

Sometimes devs get really obsessed and greedy with money, that's the point they start releasing dozens of dlcs instead of fixing their game's code and giving more opportunities for players.

When search and destroy dlc got released, it was fair, because they knew that their fanbase might not like guns inside their game about saving people, but it all went south after the industrial dlc. However, it was bearable, as you could still enjoy the update and even dig ores without the dlc.
 
What do we see today? Space dlc adding quite alot of content, that would be useful in game without the dlc itself, as i do not plan on going to space, but i do need stabilising pivots for my own usage.

I've lost my fire that was burning inside me for this game, as all my crazy and innovative ideas seemed unreachable because of the bugs and lack of motivation.

I look forward to see this game turn into something better, rather than another garbage full of dlcs that you usually crack and pirate.

Stormworks is one of the best chill games I have gotten; I enjoy just sailing around or driving, but I have not improved at flying helicopters or planes since I got the game years ago. But that's the learning curve, right?

It's an excellent game to kill time and enjoy the various locations.

[h3] Improvements [/h3]

[list]
[*] - I would love to see the creative island to be improved a little more with a helicopter pad or two for helicopters' easy take-off and landing instead of spawning them in the hangar where it's a pain in the ass trying to get out of.

I'll probably add more when it comes to mind.

Hello. Not much has changed. Same issues. Just letting folks know in case they thought about returning. Save yourselves lads. I'm too far gone, and there's no going back for me.

[h1]Update 2: 12/31/2022[/h1]
Added more info & screenshots. There are some welcome QOL changes and updates. Since my last update, there have been more reports of players being banned on the official Discord server. New content has been added but most of the focus seems to be on paid DLC. Devs launched a fun community Halloween event... turns out, players could only participate if they bought the DLC for it.

[h1]Update 1: 2/16/2022[/h1]
More updates. 2yrs out of EA, some issues fixed.

[h1]The Beginning: 05/18/21[/h1]
I'm not a veteran supporter, nor am I a critic. On the surface, I thought the game looked fun so I gave it a go. But the surface cannot compare to what lurks in the depths below. While I don't want this review to be strictly criticism I must warn that it is far from finished and you should stay away. The developers seem open to feedback, but it is contradictory. [url=https://imgur.com/a/rQhYhT9]Here's a perfectly summarized post.[/url]

Before continuing, I feel I must address rumors of users being banned on the official SW Discord when providing feedback for the game. A well known member, [b]Rifleman,[/b] was muted after reaching out to provide suggestions & feedback. His complaints were promptly addressed and patched the following week. However, he was soon banned from the Discord. A review of the game was posted, detailing his experience. The devs' response: ""The moderation team were concerned about misinformation, toxic and derailing behaviour."" 

As a parting gift to the community, Rifleman's final upload was, quite literally, [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormworks/comments/lyfqfs/]a dumpster fire.[/url] This too was banned. But little did they know, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415544542]that fire has spread.[/url][/i]

Edit - [url=https://imgur.com/NEdmii3]They did, in fact, know the fire had spread. They have taken to banning these from the workshop, in an effort to suppress it.[/url]

[h1]Summary[/h1]
On the surface, the game is simple. In Career mode, you earn money by rescuing AI and performing tasks. To do these you need to build contraptions. Choose from a preset or start fresh. More components, tools will require more cash. Creating complex objects will have a steep learning curve. Beyond, there is Creative mode. There is no ""goal"". Weather events can be super fun! Spawn Tsunamis, Tornadoes for the storm-chasers, and massive creatures.

The Steam workshop is great! But without warning, an update some years ago had broken [i]hundreds[/i] of user-created missions that were enjoyed, and with it, removed a progression system. Creating new missions also now requires learning a bit of Lua. The world on the other hand, is mostly barren and devoid. The ocean is lacking in true depth. The seafloor itself is a flat texture, and no exaggeration, I've seen better sand in the Bikini Bottoms. Best way I can describe is by comparing to Subnautica's prototype build in ~2013. That build had [url=https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/subnautica/images/5/53/Subnautica_prototypes.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20150521234251]plant life and vegetation.[/url] There are no plants here.

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198949350145/recommended/573090/]Stormworks still suffers from issues dating far back as 2018.[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Drogowit/recommended/573090/]Pleas to fix the game were not addressed quickly enough.[/url] Many longtime supporters moved on. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017038053/recommended/573090/]The devs released Stormworks from EA.[/url] Furthermore, they are [u]in the process of developing their second game[/u] as featured on their website - which might explain delays. There are some nice additions. But alas, it'd be great if other areas got that attention. [b]You'll find yourself playing for a week, leaving, and coming back to repeat what you did until you remember why you left.[/b]

[h1]Performance[/h1]
SW isn't a particularly demanding game. However, spawning large ships (especially those downloaded from the Workshop) will result in a slowmotion effect, should your Physics Detail be set to anything higher than the [u]Low setting.[/u] Any complaints I've seen regarding this, have been dismissed saying [i]""Your CPU/GPU can't is not powerful enough,""[/i] or [i]""buy a new card and it will go away""[/i]. Not always true. Some games simply have poor optimization. The devs confirmed this below, and have dismissed such complainees like myself as ""armchair experts"". See here: [url=https://imgur.com/a/JoKj3W0]Title Reference[/url] [url=https://imgur.com/pZ3rz3k]Bandwidth claims[/url] [url=https://imgur.com/Igds061] 'Armchair & Muitithreading Experts'[/url]

The developers claim that people are saying ""just speed up the game,"" this is not what all the complaints say. No one is claiming to be an expert, either. We are just customers who love games, and want them to work as expected. What you have is a horrible engine.

As of 2022, I upgraded from an GTX 1080ti to an RTX 3070ti. The change in performance is so seamless, it's like it doesn't exist! As it turns out, the developers intentionally slowed down the physics timestep to prevent the stuttering. Only it didn't seem to fix the issue, but rather skirt around it.

[h1]Multiplayer Experience[/h1]
The experience is anything but pleasant. If several players spawn a boat, a tank, and a car, the game will be relatively fine. If one player so much as spawns a large rocket, everything becomes [i]unplayable[/i] for everyone serverside. Otherwise it's quiet! Some players may prefer this, but if you're looking for a bustling atmosphere you'll have a better time elsewhere.

To summarize:
[*]The chat box takes up about 1/3rd of your screen, can't be turned off, hidden or resized.
[*]Players cannot be muted.
[*]No way to check your exact ping. It's 'out-of-sync' or 'in sync.'
[*]No way to sort servers by player count/ping.
[*]Some servers require going through a process to join their Discord server for their server, so you can spawn your favorite vehicle which cannot be spawned, without making it lag for everyone, then you get banned by an admin.
[*]The community makes the game tolerable.
[/list]

[h1]Closing Statement[/h1]
The game had potential and a talented community. But the issue is one I've seen with too many games throughout the years: a good concept being ruined by misdirection. A quick look at the r/stormworks subreddit will tell you enough. Even the admins there have, and I quote, [i]""got the cold shoulder"".[/i] Why?

Months ago, there were rumors of weapons being added and some weren't satisfied with this news. Some felt it took away from the ""Search and Rescue"" aspect. Now they've released a Weapons DLC for $10. They released paid DLC for a $25 game lacking in content, but still ask players for more. To add insult to injury, the weapons are actually in the game. You just can't fire them!

My review will likely be overlooked. But I thought it was worth the time, if it meant others saving money. My refund was denied after 3hrs. Hope this helps, but I also hope the game improves. I'm sure most criticism is by players who genuinely wanted it to be better.

The devs claim to want feedback, so here it is. Compile a dataset based those who do/don't enjoy the game and what the issues are. Move to performance optimization, then QOL fixes, then community outreach. Look at how other devs interact with their community, Deep Rock Galactic, No Man's Sky for example. What mistakes did they make? How do they interact with their community?

There are far better games for less than half the price.",1620845467,1706833219,False,188,15,0.705041289329528809,15,True,False,False

Although the game has alot of interesting concepts and amazing tools for creating vehicles and what not, the developers do not respect the community.  Instead of fixing bugs that have been present for a very long time, they would rather add new DLC (which you pay for on top of the game) just so they can squeeze you of more money. Buy this game if you want to build cool vehicles, don't buy the DLC. We shouldn't have to be paying for more DLC when the base game costs $35 AUD and another $15 AUD for the weapons pack. This game is not in a finished state. It lacks content, has a load of bugs and a multiplayer which is nearly unplayable if you live anywhere outside the United States. This game is not worth the $50 AUD price tag if you want the base game and the first dlc. I love this game, but I cannot recommend people buy it in its current state for how much they are charging.

The most recent DLC (Space DLC) was extremely underwhelming, adding an aspect of the game that is watered down and is not played. Space travel is extremely limited and difficult, and the building system around spacecraft sucks. The only good thing to come out of the update was the pressure system which also hasn't made a noticable impact. I am a huge space nerd, I was honestly really excited for the space DLC, it did not meet expectations. It feels like a slap in the face again to have another 15$ Non-refundable DLC under deliver.

I will keep playing the game, as I enjoy the level of freedom in building, but I would not recommend buying it. It is a hard game to get into with a steep learning curve to start building proficiently. The only DLC you should buy is the Weapons DLC, the others are not worth it.

EDIT ----
(795 hours as time of writing)
Although I still firmly believe my criticism is valid, especially with the DLC and prices, having put more hours into this game, I feel more comfortable recommending the game to people.
The game is basically one of a kind. There is very few if any other games which offer the same level of sandbox building capability. Although the skill-curve in building is astronomical, it is rewarding once you finally master it. In my experience, it took hundreds of hours to become decently proficient in building well. What this means though is that every player develops a unique building style.

If you want a game that can be frustrating but allows for an unmatched engineering experience in gaming, stormworks is a great option if you are willing to shell out $50 for base game and the DLC.",1644297792,1706764536,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, I am prone to building games and the rescue genre has been poorly attempted in the past but has always been a desire to find a reliable game. In a game totally based on ""Your ability"" to learn, adapt to, or create around issues to make your build successful ... This is a Great Game !

I have found even the frustrating things or road blocks to be the very reason I strive to overcome the challenges to build my creations and enjoy the game. I see a lot of hate which obviously the large majority of reviewers are a bit spoiled and have no clue what it takes to maintain a working game, let alone please everyone. Does that make you wrong, not necessarily but, the Devs have regular updates and really cool DLCs. Does that make them ""perfect""? NO. 

 My hat is off and salute to folks like ProfNCognito & MrNJersey. They have all sorts of inspiration and ""How To's"" for helping learn the game or not to fall into the mistakes we have all made in our builds or misunderstanding of the game physics. 

If you don't like something, Build around it. If you don't like building, subscribe to a build you like and use it to rescue those dumb *** NPCs. LOL

Bottom line, if you ask for help, be very specific, or share your problem so folks can actually try to help. In most cases, you need to test your build until you find the best fit or balance, then after endless attempts, go back to the drawing board and try again. The fun part is, sometimes you come up with cool shit after hours of building a worthless wreck. 

I look forward to the new fishing aspect of the game. I am sure it will break something, but they will fix it when they can. There is plenty to keep you busy and a lot to enjoy about the game. A lot of pros, a lot of cons. If it weren't so, it would be boring as hell. Hope this is helpful to you.

Yes i have 500 hours on this game and i used to absolutely love it. i last played about a year ago and classic mode was a lot of fun. however, after returning after a year, classic mode has become buggy and unplayable.

here are some of the issue i encountered that really ruined the game for me (these used to work perfectly 1 year ago)
-Npcs no longer follow you step by step, making rescues hard
-island sirens go off every 5 mins and a tsunami will tear through without warning
-they removed the ability to buy fuel at your base (pair this with the starter base with no nearby fuel depots, the world will be soft locked because you have no fuel nor the ability to purchase more)
-a cold front will come through and kill you without warning (resulting in the theft of arctic cloths form passing ships)
-Save states don't save your player location (if your boat is on autopilot, you reload the save and you fall off the boat)
-and my final straw was the fishing update (any update really). i have spent hours dealing with this buggy mess in classic just to try to enjoy the game as i used to. but every time the game gets an update, your old save becomes corrupt or buggy. meaning now when i load into my 30 hour world I've been playing on, all my vehicles disappear after 5 mins of driving/flight

Don't get me wrong, i love this game and I've spent 500 hours on it because i enjoy the creative process. but it seems the devs have abandoned the survival/career aspect of it and they neglect the bugs and keep it unplayable.

again, i can not in good faith recommend this game for people who want to relax and build their S&R company.",1706730662,1706730662,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me be frank. I know I have 1000hrs and am giving it a negative review. This is a warning to new people, this game has been falling apart for years and I am sadly desperately wishing it wasn't and instead in a playable state. And like some casino whale, I keep coming back to this every few months hoping it is fun again like beta, only to find ""NEW"" plastered on the same old falling apart pile of garbage.

TL:DR - The Game is constantly adding new content while ignoring older stuff. New and Flashy is the real motto here not build and rescue, I'm fine with new content, just SWBR lets its base game rot and that is the real crime here. 
The Vehicle Builder is what keeps this game alive, it is one of the best out there. However, many of the creations shown in trailers or in the workshop require known bugs/glitches/exploits to function ""realistically"" along with outside file editing.
The AI is very basic and annoying at times.
Physics are annoying and rage inducing
The Career mode was has two versions, and both are unbalanced and unplayable. 
Multiplayer, is a coin flip from patch to patch if it'll work wonderfully, or be a laggy mess.
This game, was honestly more fun in beta than it is now and they hooked me in back then, and I keep chasing it to see if it'll be good again. Stormworks comes down to it's vehicle builder only, as there is next to no use outside of it, don't bother to buy Stormworks if you are looking to run a Rescue Agency, Play with the Economy, Explore, or create a network of fun vehicles all doing unique jobs, then go find something else. If you like supergluing Lego sets together while mixing in some Megablocks and leaving them to collect dust on a shelf, then Stormworks is for you, get it. Otherwise, put your money to something better.

If you want a little more detail on why I currently can not recommend, you can continue reading.

Creative ability - Saving Grace +++
Not much more to add about the builder, like I said, it's one of the best out there. The features added into it, and the creative freedom it allows is wonderful, it's S+ for sure and the only reason I see this game survive. Even if you don't wish to learn the logic and lua coding for complex working, there are plenty of download and drop workshop creations to make your life easier. The only issue where the creator gets messy and annoying is on the logic side of things, the larger and more in depth a creation, the more of an absolute mess it can become. But it's Doable and worth putting up with verse all the other features in the vehicle maker. However,

Physics - Major issue one.
It's a cluster F. it's hard to know where to begin which what's wrong. But I'll start with the coping the community does for it. Buoyancy is a joke in this game, building a 1:1 replica of a ship can have it sit in the water lower than a submarine. Many people use a glitches such as the Pivot glitch to increase buoyancy, or simply build a shell where the original interior is removed for a void to cut down on weight. When it comes to aircraft, lift from wings and surfaces does not mater, and power is king. You can make a Winnebago go to space with just the right engine tweaking, now this point is a bit of a good and bad thing, it's nice to have the freedom to make anything fly, but it can be very immersion breaking seeing that 100m ship take off like a jet fighter. And if Space Engineers has Clang, then Stormworks has Clunk, because sometimes the littlest of things can randomly put a creation into a clunking PC killing spazzing out mess, and blocks don't get fully destroyed, so it will forever be there unless you can remove it from the game. The Physics in this game also nerf a lot of usability of creations and makes Career frustrating as heck, speaking off.

Career Mode, ya know that ""Rescue"" part in Build and Rescue. - Major Issue two.
This was fun, and worked back in 2019 and older. But when the full release came out, it fell apart and worse yet, that was years ago and it's barely been giving any love. Career mode has two options, Normal and Classic. Normal is a rouge mode were death is death and only thing you worry about is Cash and Fuel. Classic allows you to respawn, and adds research back into the game (yes they removed it at release, then added it back... and made it worse) but that research is just slapped in there (I'll get back to this). 
There is ""custom mode"" but the options are always present, it's like giving a Minecraft playing creative and telling them to play by survival rules. The Options are never given before world creation, and only exist in the custom mode, Oh but, somethings are needed to be adjusted before world creation just to make it confusing. On top of that when in ""Custom mode"" the mission generator has no balance and will give you missions beyond you starting bases. The missions themselves are basic and feel like babysitting a world full of toddlers instead of running a rescue agency as every boat, car, and plane needs a fire put out medical attention. But maybe, once in a blue moon you may get a Med-evac or Deep sea rescue or some form of verity.
Back to one of the other flaws, if you want more for a career mode and play classic to get that research tree, well it's moss. It's laggy for some reason, Has no clear direction, and will have you just clicking the random buttons with icons and a brief list of parts with no idea if it'll unlock the parts you are looking for down the road. Knowing the devs, they'd remove it from the game again instead of fixing it if they knew they could sweep it under the rug unnoticed. And this leads into another aspect of career, abandonment for the new, the older the island in this game, the less inclined you are to visit it, because it's simply had all it's content removed instead of updated. And that brings us to,

NEW AND FLASHY! Ignore the old - The third nail in the coffin.

Now again, there is nothing wrong with adding new content, or even paid DLCs of content to keep a game going. For me personally, Paradox alone would know they got me in for as a Grand Strategy player. However, Geometa, and Stormworks needs help. The base game is so rotten and falling apart, that throwing a new DLC ontop of it just highlights the issues. There have been major balancing issues, for so long, most Let's plays end 20-30 episodes in without getting out of the early game. A lot of major bugs and glitches have been here so long, everyone has learned to work WITH them. The Base game is in some dire need of TLC. But just look back at the release history of updates. You'll see constant boasting of the newest greatest thing for months followed by ""minor bug fixes"" that always seem to be fixing the same bugs coming back over and over. You'll find tones of creations being promoted by the devs, that when you download them are full of exploits, glitches and external file editing to make them work as intended. Now I ask you, does that sound like a well put together game? Why should I be expected to edit files outside the game, or rely on exploits to make my creations function correctly?

Closing on everything, I guarantee if you are a creative type, you'll fall in love with this games vehicle maker, but find next to no use for those vehicles within the game itself. It's a lot like building Legos with superglue, you get a tone of fun making it, but then it sits on the shelf with no use what so ever besides being pretty and you can never play with it again. The Career mode is a joke, the physics annoying as hell, and the DLCs don't add much beyond being a cash grab. This game is for money, not love. If I knew what it would turn out to be, I would have never bought it years ago, and I would have never recommend it back then.

There was an ""audio update"", that was supposed to address a number of things, but I only noticed a hand full of effects changed that sound a lot worse than before. The only thing you hear from land vehicles lke trains, is the wind and a very faint ""hum"" for an engine sound. Optimizations are piss poor. Doesn't matter how powerful your computer is, loading in giant ships or any big addon WILL slow your game down nearly to a grinding halt.  Devs will release an update adding something, add bugs to it, then  move on to something else. I have 2 of the 3 DLC's. The gun one, and the Industrialization one. FIrst is good. I like that.

Review after 1600hours
In my overall experience and review in 2024 is that I would not recommend people this game. 
One of the few reason behind this idea relates to the different play style and the amount of time you would need to accomplish.
To enjoy it you would need to choose
1. Be creative, and build your ideal vehicle/Con: Require Massive amount of time learning the basic and the logic behind Stormworks to achieve builds which you would imagine (includes different micro controllers, and component)
2.  Workshop enjoyed, this play style is great as it doesn't require abundance of time. Con: Easily get board(in my experience), and not fun with out friends.
3. Stormworks Career, this is a mode in stormworks which focuses on the rescuer aspect. Con: the massive problem with this mode is how hard it is to save people and locate them. Also it is one of the limiting mode as it restrains your creativity on vehicle. To successfully play this you would need to take option 1 to make your rescue effective

Overall my basic point is that to enjoy this game you would need to invest massive time, learning, building. I would only recommend this to a user who can invest heavily on video games. 

With the DLC I have no idea other then the weapons dlc, if you have military interest this is not a game for you, rather I would recommend a war thunder guy for this game.",1617193234,1706448852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, the game itself is awesome. I will say the animal behaviors are quite primitive compared to games like Abzu, Stranded Deep, Planet Zoo and Death In The Water 2 (which has probably the best behaviors out of the 4-fish retract into corals, sharks cautiously circle you before attacking just like in real life, etc.)-they mostly just bump into you and your vehicles. And I will explain how I might want that fixed. But other then that, it's awesome. Online is okay, usually filled with kids because the main YouTubers who play this game, Camodo Gaming and Spycakes, while not necessarily for kids, aren't super edgy and adultish either. But, to be honest, that's how I was introduced to this game when I was around 11, and I do greatly enjoy it. I also wouldn't recommend building your own vehicles unless you're quite experienced-the game doesn't really have any blueprints for specific vehicles like helicopters, ships, planes, and the like-so it is quite tricky to build your own vehicles unless they are so simple only an amoeba could understand them. I'd recommend getting vehicles off the Steam Workshop and adding your own modifications to start practicing building vehicles.",1706386452,1706386452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why doesn't this game have a manual? the one that comes with the steam purchase is an epilepsy warning. Does this game have any official learning material? The tutorial is a joke because after you respawn the boat they built for you, the next mission they give you requires a working radar of some kind, which is on your boat, but what channel do you use? there are 0-9 channels, there is no explanation, and the boat you are given has a build warning at the workshop about the radar. Either the boat for the tutorial is outdated, or they gave you a non-working boat on purpose for you to have the sense to fix just for the game to progress. Where is the official learning material? Where are you supposed to learn how to build a boat from? Or anything for that matter. I want to learn on my own, from the game or official sources.

Locked, water tight compartments now leak for no apparent reason. Screw this game.
""What about your bilge pipes?"" you might ask. That's a good point, I checked them. They all have check valves and they're all oriented correctly. ""What about over-pressuring them due to depth."" Good point but the check valves don't get over pressured and the freaking compartments are 6 feet above the surface of the water. I am an experienced builder and know how to do basic plumbing in the game. These ships worked before the pulley and space updates and were mostly complete with the exception of some QOL features. The game is simply garbage with garbage devs.

This was a great game. One of the best, if not THE best, block building game on the market IMHO. Planes, trains, automobiles, jets, VTOLs, speedboats, submarines, jetpacks, helicopters, variable swing-wing jets, cargo planes.....you name it, you could build it, all with missions to use your creations in. It used to be that way.

Then the devs decided to remove most of the missions and make the same mistakes that Space Engineers made and over-complicate things. Complicated is not the same thing as complex. Winches used to be straight forward. You want a mag winch? No problem, just put a mag end on a regular winch. You want a liquid hose? No problem, just run the pipe from a tank to the winch and put a liquid connector on the end. Now, they use a complicated wiring setup that changes depending on which end you put on it. Want to do a jet powered boat? Ok, but screw physics, people were building boats that moved too fast and exposed the flaws in their physics engine so instead of fixing the engine, they made it so you wouldn't see the flaws by limiting the speed. They nerfed the ever living shit out of the water pumps, and gear boxes now appearantly don't work if you use them on generators. Due to a small but obnoxiously loud set of people who keep banging on the realisim drum, this game has gone from an exceptionally fun creative game to a micro-management simulator where the devs have gone so far out of the way to make sure you don't exceed a set speed limit or build an extremely efficient engine. Oh, and if you don't know Lua scripting, don't plan on building any of their advertised newer features like radar. It seems that instead of doing their jobs and developing a game, they're only going to do part of the work and make the players build the rest of the components for them. The funny thing is, those same idiots that are clamoring about realisim are happy about having to build the game for the devs like a bunch of toolbags. If I wanted realisim, I'd shut the computer down. Additionally, by trying to achieve realisim, they have gone so far in the opposite direction that the extreme glaring flaws and lack of realisim stand out like a sore thumb. I want a game where I can put a radar console on my bridge and a radar antenna on the roof and have it work. Not have to actually program it. I don't want to have to learn a new programming language just so I can fill in the missing game sections the devs didn't make it around to completing. Now it's just another developer making the player create the game via scripting. Any past good reviews this game got no longer apply to this newer version. The devs need to do the work they already got paid to do. Build a game, not a scripting interface with a few blocks. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere on a complete game, not this half-baked crap.

**UPDATE 22-NOV-23**
This game is no longer worth playing nor waiting for the devs to pull their collective heads out of their forth point of contact. It's a series of major broken features followed by minor bug fixes , followed by even more broken game elements. It's not even worth getting at a discount unless you like frustration.

Overall, I've greatly enjoyed my time playing Stormworks. It's not a perfect game, there are definitely some areas that I think could be improved. But what it does right makes it worth coming back to again and again, spending hours happily tinkering with whatever I've decided to create. 

Speaking of, the parts and systems available allow you to build and program just about anything. You could build a SAR speed boat, a train and cars for hauling cargo containers, a GPS autopilot with touchscreen capabilities, a diesel-fueled generator, a tractor-trailer, a VTOL aircraft, a research submarine, even a flying battleship, the list goes on. If you can think it or you've seen it, you can very likely build it. 

That said, I should mention that the game is not a perfect simulator. The rules of its world are based heavily on our own, but they are not a one-to-one match. Take your time, experiment with the various systems, and you'll pick up the games quirks in no time.

But at the end of the day, if you like games that let you set your own rules and goals. give you tons of intricate parts to tinker with, and let you change and configure the game to your liking, then I bet you'll like Stormworks.",1697438227,1705810823,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

edit: there is one glaring issue i completely forgot about: the pressure system. it's completely broken. i've heard that it was made broken with the space DLC release and it has not been fixed. the main issue that has come of it is that bilge pumps in literally any airtight vehicle can now pump out air (even though that makes no sense cuz why would a pump pump out both water AND air at the same time) and they somehow have enough power to depressurize the interior so  much that not even a diving suit can withstand it. you obviously begin to die pretty quickly which is extremely frustrating. it's easy enough to work around but most workshop crafts that have bilge pumps become death traps due to the new broken mechanic. i cannot recommend this game in light of all the issues, this one being kind of the cherry on top

After the full release, over 800 hours across two accounts and even more time spent in the community I can confidently say that most of the devs don't care about the community. This review isn't necessarily critical of the game as much as it's critical of the devs, especially the head developer Deltars. Don't get me wrong, the game has great bones, but the way the game is planned in response to the community is horrible. I can tell that the developers love their game and have put their hearts and souls into it. The general ideas behind the game are great but dare you say to their faces that the devs can improve a feature or that something needs work and you will be instantly silenced, whether it be getting banned on their Discord or blocked from the Subreddit. This behavior actually caused multiple groups to abandon Stormworks altogether and make their own games. A little advice for all developers, if you make a game and ask for feedback, don't get mad when people point out the problems that need to be fixed. Don't add more features when the existing ones don't work to begin with. 

With all that said, it is also not okay for the community to bully the devs when you don't get your way. For example during the vote for the controversial weapons DLC, the devs got a crapton of hate for having it as an option. And when it was announced that it was going to be a paid DLC they got hate for that since it was originally proposed as a free update. The devs, while sometimes frustrating, are also humans who have themselves and families to take care of. Give them some slack, but also hold them accountable, respectfully. Unfortunately until the devs become better at managing and interacting with the community this review will stay negative. I have hope for this game and I do believe that it's not too late to fix the problems with it, but the devs and specifically Deltars, need to improve.

The game is pretty fun, and it's polygon art style doesn't look bad at all.
I like how the building mechanics work as you have to setup cooling, fuel pipes, electricity, etc.

BUT.
There are some problems, depending on how you were going to play the game.

First, the realistic building to some can be bad, as it means this game requires a lot of your time (This isn't an issue if you're just going to use workshop vehicles).

Second, on that time topic, absolutely anything you do in this game with no exaggeration is going to take a long time (If you don't have time on your hands don't buy this).

Third, if you're planning on playing with friends, reconsider. Because the multiplayer in this game is really laggy, and its funky walking movement adds up to an unplayable mess (Singleplayer is better, and multiplayer is just too laggy). -Edit: Multiplayer is a bit better now, but if you're sensitive to any bit of lag it's not that good.

Fourth, The game is so realistic that it's really hard, and at times can feel like everything you did to rescue somebody went all to waste, as one mistake can lead to failure. I'll list some things that can end your run as an example: (Engine overheating, crashing, running out of fuel, running out of battery, running out of time, weather destroying you vehicle, etc).

The game is decent, but if any of these things bother you, look into a different game.",1577908500,1705700608,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game itself is fun mostly because of its great community. The way i play usually involves messing around in the top workshop vehicles of the week, enjoying myself and just messing around. This usually means avoiding some of the more controversial update issues, but this most recent update affected me as well, despite not interacting with most of the game in a meaningful manner. Somehow, the devs did not catch several major issues that bugged 9 out of 10 vehicles.

Unfortunatly, the devs dont seem to really know how to manage their community all that well, which tends to lead to what the community perceives as blameshifting, not taking responsibility, or simply not talking enough to the playerbase. They've got good reason to not want to talk to the community, in the cases they've tried they've ended up expressing themselves extremely defensively and provoking the community, but at this point you'd think they'd have learned how to communicate efficiently with them, which is made especially apparent by how one-way they perceive such communications.

If the devs had decided to outsource testing to the community, which has expressed interest in doing so time and time again since before even 1.0, they would be able to catch the flaws in the update quickly and easily. However, they instead continue to test internally, and miss glaring flaws in the game's features due to it, and cause massive damage to their already smaller community.

However, the devs dont really listen to their community as much as they should, and what info they DO have from their community is a poll from early 2021 that really doesnt reflect the community anymore. A real shame.

Overall, enjoy the game you have between updates. You never know if the next one will ruin it.",1574873804,1705691551,False,0,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

its getting a little better i guess, single player mostly works for a while - but mp is still borked so  meh

get it on sale maybe




Well im stil here at 4500 hours ...... game still annoys the hell outta me , but for the price per hour of gametime, i cant not recommend it.

Game is now garbage-barley runs 30mins without crashing- mp even less time, maybe 15 before the dedicated server has to restart. 
turns out devs dont give a damn, actively censor people and this has caused many players to give up or move on completely.

The building is way too complicated and buggy and when you do manage to build something large there's a good chance it will crash the game. Multiplayer is also very laggy / buggy. Don't get me wrong, this is a great game if you are into engineering and very complex building but if you are a more casual player this game is not for you. Of course you can just download vehicles from the steam workshop and most of the time they will work / not crash the game (at least not immediately) but if you want to just go fly prebuilt planes do it on Microsoft flight simulator where the graphics are decent. It's priced way to high, the shouldn't be selling a unfinished game for full price.

I'll show you the cons i dealt with first. You may not have these cons, or you may not have these pros, because this is from my experience.

1. The build areas are way too small. [you can edit their size but if you're anything like me, its a hell of a process]

2. There are some glitches here and there though not too many.

3. Just the normal version is $25, its expensive!

4. if you buy all of the DLCs, your total is $55, again, expensive.

Now, here are some pros.

1. you can build whatever you want, whenever you want, but not wherever because the size of the build area varies in size for each workbench. [The largest workbench is the oil rig, but everything you spawn there is static]

2. You can make your own servers, hang out with friends, and even start a successful YouTube career, if you're good enough.

3. if you buy one, two, or all of the DLCs, its a lot more fun, you can access more multiplayer servers, access guns [in-game of course], find oil and even go to space and recreate the first Moon Landing.

4. You can build things and post them on the Steam Workshop, so your friends can access it and even random people you've never met can see and play with your creation.

5. Just have fun! You can do whatever you want in this game, even mess around with some files to make the game look cooler or just to see what it does.

I've shown you you the pros and cons of my gameplay, you can make a better experience for yourself and others, just by controlling your emotions. I'ts a lesson I've learned the hard way, but you, the viewer, can control your feelings and make the gameplay better for all.

I really don't want to do this, but I've waited for a year now, and nothing has changed.

I have 440 play hours. Stormworks is one of the best games I've ever played; you could say I fell in love with it. Only because of this game, I got into roleplaying with friends. Only because of this game, I have so many good memories with my friends in this game. It was perfect.

So why don't I recommend it? Why a thumbs down?

Well, it's because of what is happening to all games: the developers get greedy.

Back in 2019-2020, the game ran slower. Yes, you read it right, slower. When you were in multiplayer and you spawned a big vehicle, you had no lags, but your game would get slower.

Then the weapon DLC came out, and I bought it instantly, but it got worse.

In fact, it got so bad that when you pressed E, the game reacted 45 seconds later! And after some time, it's even noticeable in single-player too.

Multiplayer was dead for me, but hey, there is a singelplayer. Yeah, but after 55 hours, it gets pretty boring, trust me.

It's just sad. This game is the reason why I am into roleplay now, why I am better at building stuff. Hell, I only know what an APU of a helicopter is because of the game.

And now that? The devs are putting out DLC after DLC. Weapons, that weird second island, and now space? Bro, fix your game before you put new content in.

And I also asked support, but they just told me (and I'm not lying), ""just play on a better PC.""

It always has some sort of weird thing that you can do (not even any of the bugs) that can make be double over with laughter. From flinging yourself across both massive islands with crazily geared rotors being powered by two dozen large motors, to making ships do back flips with ridiculous modular engines, motors, and propellers, this game is sure to offer you a unique experience, no matter what you plan on doing. 

The ship physics are amazing, although the aircraft and vehicle mechanics could use some help: really heavy vehicles like to jump up and down rapidly if placed on wheels, tracks, friction pads, or really anything, for that matter, and having flown in numerous planes and jets, the aircraft physics aren't quite there yet; such as decreasing control-ability with increasing speed. 

Something I'd like to see implemented is breakable parts. If something is shot with a gigantic missile, it should blow the thing to smithereens, but instead it simply starts taking on water and slowly sinking, no matter how big of a bomb you blow it up with.

However, here is a big issue: BeamNG.drive can be run on my laptop on high graphics and get decent frame-rates. This game however, running on the physics engine that is has, sucks as much CPU power as BeamNG.drive does on high graphics. Note that I have 16GB of RAM in my laptop, with an i7 core and iris Xe graphics. Sure, Intel doesn't always do good on games, but it gets the job done for what I use it for.

Of course, I realise that it would be a huge undertaking to replace Bullet with a more advanced and user/PC-friendly game/physics engine, but it may need to be done, especially with the upcoming space DLC.

I also have the issue of an occasional blue-screen whenever I play for extended periods of time. Every 1.5-2.5 hours my PC will suddenly freeze, and then go to the blue-screen whenever I am playing, which has sometimes caused major issues with my system. I'm not sure whether this issue is something I am doing wrong, or if the game simply doesn't like me, but it has resulted in me playing less and less. Sure, I currently have nearly 1000 hours of play-time, but recently I just haven't been playing, not because of boredom at all, but because of the blue-screen habit.

August 29th, 2023. Tried to boot up the game, and after not even a full minute of game-play, it completely crashed. This is pretty sad not gonna lie. I was actually looking forward to starting a new world and just building and testing things, but instead got this. I'm typing this about a half hour after the game crashed my computer, because it crashed so hard that it has just now let me back on. And also, if you check the update logs, this is long after the ""Critical Fix Update"" that was supposed to fix this.
DEVS PLZ GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER

Overall, gameplay-wise, it is a great way to simulate ships if you enjoy that type of stuff!

 damn physics object is classed as a different vehicle like at least a 100 block limit before its classed as a different vehicle plus the fact that sometimes my fighter randomly disappears and i fly about a kilometre forward in the seat position but still has the afterburner effect where it disappear, Oh yeah i know i've asked Alot but paid 35 bucks for this plus the weapons and industry DLC but i would really like a thrust vectoring nossle as a jet exhaust.

EDIT: They released an update tied to a DLC I've never wanted and now all my workshop creations are broken. I won't fix all of them just because they can't secure legacy data. I'm not going back to the game until it's fixed and I won't buy the DLC because they didn't care that it would break everything. I absolutely do not recommend this game.

I love this game. 

Let's take a look at why:

You build vehicles such as ships, locomotives, cars, trucks, airplanes, jets and helicopters. 

In Advanced Mode, you also build the working parts of those vehicles such engines, cooling, drivetrain, electrics, piping, transmission, ECU, computers, radars, sonars, etc.

The best part is that you have missions to test the things you built and then you can easily share them on the Steam Workshop.

If you like Space Engineers but feel you lack something to do with your ship once built, Stormworks is right for you...except there's no space stuff but you know...

All mechanics work very close to the real world so if they built it in the real world, you can probably build it too.",1561983009,1704834812,True,0,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

This is the most advanced and detailed building game that has ever been made. Nothing else has ever come close to this and probably nothing else ever will. However it has one major and fatal flaw: Lua blocks.

If you want to make something really amazing and complicated, you have to use microcontrollers. Microcontrollers can be composed of primitive logic blocks but to really make anything good, you have to program in lua and build them in lua blocks. Not a bad thing.

The issue is that each lua block is only allowed to contain 4096 characters max. Code comments count against this limit. Longer variable names count against this limit. It's impossible to make a sufficiently complicated build with only 4096 characters of lua code. We are forced to very crappily circumvent this limitation by building microcontrollers that contain multiple, sometimes even dozens of lua blocks connected together in a disfunctional disorganized nightmare of a mess. This puts a limit on how sophisticated your build can be. This makes all of your code 100% unmaintainable. This is such a mind-blowingly severe limitation that has greatly handicapped the playability of this game for me. It is so difficult to build and program complicated stuff that IT IS ACTUALLY EASIER TO BUILD THESE CIRCUITS IN REAL LIFE! It's easier to put a real life microcontroller on a real life circuit board, connect it to peripherals and program it with real life code to do a task than it is to do the virtual equivalent in this game. Not even 8 bit microcontrollers from the 1970s have such severe code size limitations. It is mind-blowingly ridiculous that the developers have resisted all pleas from the community to change this for all these years. It's not even a game engine limitation. The multiplayer scripts run on lua and they were fully capable of giving that a 65535 character limit. They have admitted in livestreams that such a thing would be possible YET THEY STILL WONT DO IT

I will never be changing my review to a positive one unless the 4096 lua block character limit is at least raised to 65535. People have been asking for it for years, the developers have been ignoring them for years. Enough is enough.

While the game itself is very good, and I do recommend it if this is your kind of thing, the main problem is with the developers. Here are just a few things they have done:

1. Regularly use community-made vehicles in update screenshots without crediting the creators.

2. There is next to zero communication with their player base other than through update livestreams, which are few and far between (they have a bug report and feature request page, but don't expect any responses).

3. While cool, most DLCs were an unnecessary addition. I'm not saying they should be removed, but I am saying that the effort should have been redirected to fixing multiplayer and many other issues. The best DLCs are ""Search and Destroy"" and ""Space"" (the Space DLC is also the worst because of the bugs and issues it caused on launch, but in the end, I'd say it's worth getting).

4. They continue to pump out updates that aren't requested or needed. While I and a lot of others like the additions they have made, myself, and I'm sure 99% of the community, agree that that effort should have been spent elsewhere.

Final notes: The game itself is good, and I do highly recommend it. The Lua programming for its microcontrollers got me interested in programming and software development.

An amazing game that lets you do...almost anything you want really, especially with the new DLC. You can make anything 
as complicated as a fully autonomous drone, to as simple as a hut. Really the only thing you cannot do is drill into terrain.

Unfortunately, with the wide range of things that one is capable of doing in the game, this increases the difficulty of building anything significantly. Unless you're well versed with logic systems, or are willing to learn them, building anything will be quite difficult. If building isn't your thing, there are many workshop creations, but i would not suggest this game to you as i find the most fun aspect to be building creations then being able to see them in action. However, you could very well still have alot of fun playing with other people's creations, as long as you're willing to learn how to pilot/drive/captain them.

If you are new to the game, i recommend using either the classic career mode or the custom mode at first, as the newer career turns off visible way-points, forcing you to put navigation systems in your creations which may be harsh for those trying to learn the basics of the game. Custom is akin to creative mode, however in custom you can turn off all of the infinite options, and make your own career-like settings.

Finally, if you are looking for something to challenge the creations you can make, this game has no shortage of challenges, from massive sharks that eat your creation whole, to lightning strikes that turn off your creation's electrical system.

Now for what i enjoy less, or feel could be improved.

Damage systems. The damage system in Stormworks is okay, but especially given the new DLC, i feel it could be significantly improved. More visual/audible feedback for damage, such as a bigger initial flame when in-use fuel tanks are hit, loud noises if an engine is hit, things like that. Damage stacking so far that it takes ages to fix it can be quite daunting, i think damage stacking is fine, although as implimented it could stand to be improved. While just my idea for how it could be fixed, you could make damage stacking cause water to leak in faster, or after enough damage destroy blocks entirely, making them irrepairable, but perhaps patchable to stop leaks, without causing them to take a decade to fix. Ships and aircraft explode into the shadow realm if enough damage is delt to them and it would be better if they simply received damage as normal, although i believe this is a bug.

Money. I don't feel money is handled in the game well. Refueling can be completely and totally ignored by simply respawning your vehicle, making fuel absolutely worthless unless you're planning on selling it, or crude oil. Fuel acts more as an operation range than an operational cost. Perhaps a setting to make vehicles spawn without fuel would be good, and having more diesel pumps around the map would also be nice.

Weapons DLC [It's good, but has some improvements that could be added]. While i think the ai is fine functionally, i think the way it plays is either painfully slow, or completely defensive more often than not, but i think that may just be bad luck on my end, and possibly a bug. The AI will often either capture one area beyond what they start with, or as is the case in my career attempts, never capture other areas. Additionally, some settings that one could edit before starting a game to determine stuff like capture speed, and AI aggressiveness would be nice. Weapons themselves are great to me, they feel like they have punch when you fire them, and the tracers are clearly visible. Finally, it would be nice for there to be a reason for the player to shoot down the enemy AI, or go after them. Perhaps in order to keep and be able to purchase islands in an area you could have to capture and hold a point from the AI, or immobilizing enemy vehicles or harming the crew could give the player money.

I don't expect this review to be good, i just wanted to give the game a recommended review while giving some simple notes to what i do or don't like about it. If nothing else of my rambling is understandable, 

just take away one thing:

The only solution I found was to just play through it, and that worked only part of the time. I submitted a bug report, and went on my merry way. I come back now to find the bug is still a problem, and a new space DLC that has broken by existing builds. It seems the developers have completely lost focus. Instead of fixing problems with the existing game, they add content in the form of DLC that is completely unrelated to the original scope of the project. The core code was not designed for a spherical world where realistic orbital mechanics could work, so naturally, the space DLC (at least what I have seen of it in reviews and youtube videos) fell, dare I say, flat. I wouldn't really care except they broke the product that have already paid for in the process instead of using development hours to fix existing issues. Its a real bummer, because if the would focus, offer good product support, and release DLC that was within the same sphere as the original project, It would be an amazing game.

Not even full list of major common bugs:
Saves
- Game saves in incorrect state
- Saves can break missions 
- Updates corrupt saves
Rescue missions
- Casualties may not spawn. 
Oilspill missions
- Mission areas may not spawn.
- Even cleaning up all the oil slicks does not finish the mission.
- Saving, quiting and reloading the game can break them. 
Fire missions: 
-Just let the vehicle burn down and sink completely. This finishes the mission with a reward. 
Repair missions
- Sometimes requiring very specific distance from a defect to fix.
Garages
- Recalling vehicle with multiple dropped hardpoint armaments can cause ghost physical objects to spawn in the workbench areas
Waves
- Pulling you down instead of pushing you up.
- Appearing inland from ground.
- Sometimes seams appear in the sea, causing a hard cut in the water, where water continues in a different pattern making a hole in the world. 
AI vehicles
- randomly falling into sea
- crashing into each other
- AI attack helicopters can fly upside down
- AI jets losing interest and flying off in a straight line. 
- When you see a crashed AI, you are literaly not allowed to rescue them in this rescue game. They are literaly the exact same game objects as mission targets. The devs literaly made these vehicles different and borderline went out of their way to not make them savable.
Industrial DLC
- Arid island is, I assume, stitched improperly, causing wheels to fall through the map.
- Interacting subgrids can cause oil drill area to become unusable.
Fluid
- Fluid ports spawning exhaust smoke randomly.
- Fluid gravity not working. (it used to)
- Open doors can have a wall of water behind them but only a drizzle may flow in. 
- Fluid surface may flash for a frame in the middle of enclosed volumes repeadatly
Aerodynamics
- Not broken. Just mostly not there. 
Hitboxes
- Possible to fall through slope parts.
- Possible to clip into boats when trying to climb onto them. 
- Window pieces have inconsistent hitboxes. 
Physics in general
- Two interacting grids, even with insignificant force, can push around tens of tons like nothing. In one case even causing an explosion to me... somehow.
- Clipping vehicles will cause the game to become unplayable.
- Every moving part like pivots, pistons etc. can have unbearable wobble.
Electricity
- Some electric parts do not consume electricity.
- Infinite electricity exploit.
Weapons

After you have just completed a mission the game stops responding... I may or may not have lightly touched the walls of the docks again... consider towing a boat and the ropes are so elastic that a little misapplication of the throttle will cause the towed boat to launched like a rubber band airplane...

I have just spent a few more hours in this game trying to regain some sort of motivation and fun for building and experimenting... and I wanted to give a little overview of it...

In a creative game I wanted to see what I could do with these nuclear reactors. So ive built a big floating platform to build on, nuclear reactors give more heat the hotter they are which is a good thing and i had the idea of jumpstarting a small recator that usally wouldnt be self sufficent with heaters.... sadly however i had to discover that some heaters only heat spaces but not the contents within them but also kinda cool down the reactor which dosent make sense at all and others that sort of heat gases and liquids but also dont really flow water enough to get rid of their heat ... and temperature sensors that only detect gas temperature even tho they are completly submerged by water... its a mess... nothing ever does what you would expect it to...

its feature creep to the max... lots of great ideas begun but nothing ever done right or finished.

While making all of these discoverys at the harbour i was building at, there were some containers that got washed into the building area by the never ending slew of tsunamis causing the platform to sit not in the water but on top of containers when spawned, afraid they would glitch and run the game in slow motion...i used tornadoes to sort of suck them away, which kind of worked but also caused several containers to get stuck in the habor dock walls and into each other, causing the thing i was triying to prevent in the first place... running the game in slow motion because of too much collisions due to things being glitched into each other and finally making me lose patience with the game after 128 hours of ""ohh piece of candy.. no wait... its sh!t"".


ive really tried to enjoy the many great ideas and concepts, but im hindered by the amount of game braking buggs and glitches this game constantly exposes you to... which is as i mentioned really sad because really few games allow you to solve so interesting puzzels this game and its nature exposes you too... Sadly, since this isnt open source.... i cant really solve *this*.

i keep comming back and feel like i wanna play this ... because they add cool things like winches and pitchable propellers and stuff... but tbh .. altho these new features are great they just really highlight the problem as well ... its awesome ideas but also the unablitly to actually pay attention to bugs and the actuall problems this game has... its not the lack of content.

i would like them to make a alternating rythem ... first a features update that gets them excited and every other time a update focused on balancing and bugg fixing... Problem solved.

Start simple make something that detects a bunch of collisions happening with one specific vehicle and make the player be able to choose to delete/respawn it or if its theirs move it by 5 meters...",1702231423,1704629015,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have seen many of the updates come, the introduction of handheld tools being one of my favourites. This game is NOT for everyone! You need to spend hundreds of hours working on creations just to get up to an acceptable standard. Even after roughly 1700 hours  on the game I still struggle with making decent builds. You will start off with enthusiasm but you'll have to dedicate many hours of your time. Only get it if you are into engineering, physics, coding, and stuff of the sort. I have to agree with many others, the Devs REALLY need to work more on optimisation, especially on multiplayer and not add more features for now. You also won't get away with playing the game on a sh*t box PC. I now play it on my Steam Deck, I have spent hours optimising handheld controls for that as well. I haven't really played much career so a cannot have a valid opinion on that aspect. Thsi may not be a very popular point of view, but I think the Stormworks community is great, there are discord servers with people who are happy to help you and teach you different aspects of the game, I can recommend Se-ssi' Stormworks server. In conclusion, this game is great for those dedicated people who are looking for a relatively deep and complex sandbox builder to spend time on.

Edit 1/5/24: figured it out! if you mess with the settings and turn everything to low and change anti aliasing mode it will freeze your game but not the ability to play or touch things, so it will just freeze the screen with music playing but you gotta go to settings while its still frozen and turn anti aliasing back to FXAA and turn all the graphics back up then save it, took me a hour but i was able to do it.",1687766507,1704513864,False,7,0,0.536089241504669189,4,True,False,False

the game was build around being a search and rescue game and its now nothing like that, every creation before 1.0 is extremely likely to be broken in some way, game performance just keeps getting worse and multiplayer is almost entirely ignored, the community is consistently giving feedback, good and bad but they just dont listen to what we say, they only listen to the good, never the bad, even if its constructive criticism, i have no idea what there true intentions is but what i do know they had a big staff change before 1.0 so that most likely what went wrong, they stopped doing proper play test and they ignore there beta testers.

I use to love this game but i can't if this is what the game is gonna be, a almost entirely unplayable, buggy mess with incompetent devs that only care about the numbers.",1660333342,1704423963,False,2,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

This game is absolutely amazing, it makes it stand out from any other building/freemode games. The ability to create your own airplane from scratch and make your own microcontrollers just makes the game much better and you can never stop playing it.

The ability to use the steam workshop and use/upload items on it makes it even better

Cons
While some of the cons include minor glitches/bugs which rarely occur. The largest problem which I have Come across from my gameplay is lag, especially large workshop items such as buildings of planes. In multiplayer it gets even worse when multiple objects are spawned. (I have a GeForce RTX2070) 

What I would like added:
-More shapes such as circles, cones and more window shapes
-paintable shapes like triangles, pyramids, etc instead of just being a cube
-More optimisation for multiplayer

This game looks and sounds fun, but the bugs, multiplayer, and overall replayability just isn't great. Like, career mode is pretty pointless to be honest, and custom is fun for a while until you do basically everything there is. Multiplayer suffers from server issues and frequent rubber-banding. Every mod is basically the same, just big ships and fancy cars. Finally, natural disasters are (in my opinion) one of the main selling points of this game. But I hardly ever see them in career, and if you manage to find one nothing really happens. Tsunami's don't really wreck your boat and whirlpools just spin you around.

I load up a ship i was interested in and filled it with npc's and cargo. I placed them all in their appropriate spaces and started the engines.

As i set sail and wondered around the ship it suddenly hit me just like it has before. The question of ""Well what now?"".

The passengers stay where i left them, they dont eat nor do they walk around deck. There is no crew, everything i have to do on my own (the little there is to do) if you consider steering and clicking buttons a task. No maintenance is needed, no lights will go out. No passenger will get injured nor fall overboard other than simply gliding off the ship because of their fixed stance.

The only excitement the game has to offer is when the ship sinks which it has never happened to me unintentionally as there are barely any threats out in the water. Yes i could activate monsters or other disasters but at that point it feels wrong and unnatural and forced. Besides only so much those things add...

You dont have to worry about paying for passage or the coast guard, no pirates to worry about. There are hostile npc's but i have yet to meet them in any significant number.

The game feels like its half baked

i am still warming up to it. i started with a tutorial its pretty well done imo, then went to a sandbox creative mode just to mess around with some stuff. took me a little while to figure out some things this game does different, such as power and logic nodes are two separate things that are needed to make a light work!

i enjoy playing alot of these types of sandbox/creative games, i've played scrap mechanic, trail-makers, and plasma to name a few!
this is by far the most complex out of all of those, but thankfully not as complex as space engineers was! 
i don't think you need to be an irl engineer to enjoy this game, but just know that you will have to run at a very steep hill to learn whats going on here!

so far i have explored the example builds, experimented with a few of my own simple builds. like one problem i had (power connectors dont extend very far, so i was building a modular extension unit!)

i wanted to explore a bit before committing to any dlc but i think im gonna grab the industrial one, and possibly the guns pack, but tbh i think i will have more fun creating mining machines and stuffs! 

the name of the game seemed not so interesting to me at first, but i would consider this game more of a advanced engineering playground with an optional campaign attached if you need problems to solve. (if you are anything like me tho, you will invent problems to solve in no time!)
still kinda excited to try some more of the rescuing side of things, now i feel i have gotten the hang of some of the simpler things.

there's enough content on you tube for people to find what they need.
as someone who recently came from plasma (i was sad they stopped working on that one it had much promise and potential) anyway... this one, Stormworks... its a pretty fun engineering sandbox and even if its majorly complex, like im pretty sure i just learnt the basic concept of how a steam engine works irl just to make a generator! lol

this may be my new time sink!

i kinda want to make a large boat with a bay for a land vehicle, or maybe a modular floating trailer, or a folding portable ladder... maybe i could make a rock concert stage or a disco floor, honestly it all seems immediatly plausible, if highly complex at first!

if you love creative sand boxy games then this one is definitely a must have in your library!

Below the waves you'll find a desert devoid of almost any life. It is never deeper than 300m. The ocean seems to have 3 wave heights with little variation.

The weapons DLC is half baked, at best it's an island hopping minigame. It hardly works, as most weapons despawn as soon as they're 1km away, rendering artillery useless. The AI just bumbles around and is barely able to fire in your direction. You just sit in a van for 5 minutes to capture and then go to the next van on the next island.

The Industry DLC is just features that belong in the main game.

The maps are ""generated"" however they are all almost the exact same. You get 2 or 3 big islands and they're all usually in the same place. There are forest fires, but you will never find a forest big enough to have fun with.

However, the longer you play the worse this game becomes, and the devs are feigning ignorance. Physics in this game is something else. The worst thing is drag. In this game air is jelly - if you take a plane, the moment you turn off your engines you fall out of the sky immediately. Gliders are entirely out of the question. Since the main force you are fighting is drag, your plane will go almost as fast pointing upwards as pointing downwards. Without exploits it is impossible to fly faster than around 550km/h if you want to have a semblance of fuel economy. Any surface produces lift, so if you make a car go faster than about 160 kmh it will start taking off. All pivot joints are weak and jank around when there is any weight on them. When a rotating pivot hits the craft its on and you try to force it to rotate phantom forces will throw your vehicle to space. Guns are terribly inaccurate: the spread is about 1 degree which doesn't sound like a lot but at 200 metres you will miss a 3m tall vehicle half the time. Missile boosters are very ineffective and without XML-editing it is impossible to make a missile go further than about 3km, also remember the drag - your missiles will immediately fall out of the air when the boosters run out of fuel. Tracks are incredibly draggy - you need a ridiculous amount of power to have neutral steering not stall the engine. Radars are inaccurate - there's a 1% error margin in every direction, so at 400m you'll struggle to track a 3m tall vehicle. This also makes it impossible to measure speed with radar, since if, for example, your target is 200m away it can move by 4 metres in one tick (800 kmh) while standing still. Air is much less buoyant than IRL so more of your boat sinks which means more drag.

Devs are even worse than this. They have a feature request website that they never read. Any relatively complex creation utilizing liquids was broken by the Space DLC. The devs said they tested everything and just missed some small things, but for the first two days they broke buoyancy so basically every boat would sink immediately, which i don't thing you can miss if you open the game for longer than 3mins. For context, the community has been asking them for a long time to fix buoyancy but they were saying that they don't want to break older ships. After receiving all the critique of the Space update, they claimed that they received death threats and that actually the community is really happy, which shows how little they care. In one of their regular updates they ""fixed a bug"" with missile lift, casually breaking basically all missiles that are more advanced than a warhead, fins and a booster.

This game has a fantastic concept but it is buggy and laggy mess and the devs are completely ignoring the community and coming up with bullshit excuses not to fix anything",1698707124,1704117178,False,2,0,0.514018714427947998,0,True,False,False

I understand the developer is attempting a lowpoly style, but here it seems to be an excuse for lazy modeling and primitive art direction. UI elements feel fragile and separate with the rest of the aesthetic. 
Interaction is unsatisfying and confusing; there is a grab/lift mechanic that feels loose, shortcut keys don't really make sense, and swimming/climbing animations feel disconnected from the environment. Sure, you could try and say it's part of the game's charm. But it's hard to find that charming when everything else feels like a blockout. 
It was difficult to figure out what to do in both campaign and classic modes. First person views were claustrophobic, and the FOV is too extreme for a wide monitor. 

On my first attempt, I played campaign mode. The boat clipped through the water the whole time that I played, and it took longer than it should have to figure out the controls of the boat for how simple they really were. The throttle is hidden from view, so I have to actually point the camera down at the throttle and away from the water in order to what speed I'm setting the boat to. 

I finally get to the fire and the boat gets stuck on the beach. Putting the boat in the reverse and increasing the throttle does nothing; I'm simply stuck. There does not seem to be an easy way to exit the boat either.
 The tutorial note is prompting me to get a fire extinguisher off the floor, but I can't see it through my character's arm (again, poor FPS  perspective). I have to click in the general direction, which equips it, but then I can't seem to get it to do anything. 

I quit and restart with classic mode, which is an even less guided experience. I need to make my boat from scratch now using a 3D builder that I only located after looking up the issue online, which I really should not need to do within the first 15 minutes of playing a game. The 3D build has all sorts of extremely granular controls that at this point, I have no desire to attempt to learn because I lack any investment in the process now. Neither play mode had a suitable hook to retain me. 
A well designed interaction has a methodology that is apparent with reasonable experimentation. Over reliance on instruction is just an indicator of an unfinished product.

If you're really unlucky it will auto save while you're stuck and you can lose any progression you've made when you have to reload to your last manual save.
The waves will ignore your boats hull and push objects around.

This game has the worst building system I've ever used. In a normal game if you wanted to rotate something after placing it you would just select it and hit the rotate button. Not this game.

In this game you have to turn on the selection grid, then you have to drag the selection grid through 3d space to the location of the single component you want to change, so if your vehicle is fairly big get ready for a few minutes of dragging the selection box where you need it to be.

Now you have the object you want to rotate selected and can finally rotate it, right? Sure, if you remembered what the 6 different rotate buttons do, because the UI that shows you what directions they affect isn't shown.

But after spamming the buttons randomly you've finally got this single component rotated correctly, RIGHT? No, you have the ghost copy of it ready. So when you paste it, it's technically its own vehicle now and has to be merged back into the main vehicle or it wont work. 

It's absurd how poorly designed this is, the erase tool lets you delete things under the mouse so reuse that code to make a tool for selecting individual objects.

I tried using micro controllers and the problems are extensive. The first issue is trying to place one, they don't exist as an object you can place to start with, you have to create one and save it in the micro controller menu to get a place-able object. You would think that because it forces you to make a save file for the micro controller that any changes to that save file would effect the micro controller but that isn't the case. Once you place the micro controller it makes a copy of the save file it was based on and any modifications to it have to be done by manually selecting the micro controller. 

When my code had a error, the text describing the issue was backwards on the screen.
The code text editor doesn't have a undo button, that's insane.
The error checker can't detect obvious errors like references to undefined variables.

I truly regret buying this game and supporting such shoddy workmanship. I wish I hadn't gone over the refund time limit but I really wanted to enjoy this game. I'm amazed they put so much time and effort into some parts of the game and then skip such minor and easily implemented quality of life features.",1703811197,1703874967,False,1,0,0.494252860546112061,0,True,False,False

- Great game idea
- Vehicle editor is huge
- Open world

Negatives
- Many bugs may appear
- You HAVE to build vehicles yourself (no presets beside starter boat)
- Multiplayer bugs
- Workshop vehicles dont appear under workshop vehicles tab ingame (seems to be fixed)

I was impressed by the game and felt like it would become my next main game.
But then the bugs took over.
I decided to keep going, but then the vehicle builder got me.
No chance to just buy your next vehicle and go for it. No you have to build every single thing yourself with blocks the size of a few centimetres. The vehicle builder IS GOOD. But im missing a way around it. You can have trains, ground vehicles, planes, helicopters and boats in all sizes you want. But you have to build it all yourself, INCLUDING ALL OF THE ELECTRONICS, MECHANICS, THE FUEL SYSTEM and so on.
If there is a way around building everything on your own (like presets) or connect the electrics etc automatically, please tell me. I activated comments on this review",1703784436,1703871421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But there is no point to any of it.
The missions are very repetitive, and have no real progression. That means there is no real insentient too make crafts for many new missions or variations. The research tree kind of helps with this but the missions don't tie this together. Still I enjoyed making crafts and using them.

Worse is the constant updates that convolute the game and break things by patching without actually fixing the game. Even the tutorial craft is taking on much water now. And sinking ships which was an amazing feature is now basically gone apperantly.

Even tho building is fun for the results the system is rather convoluted with all the micro chips and cables. Those will exponentially get out of control and be messy.
Lots is possible with Lua which is nice, but the technical part of the game is too messy.

Conclusion: a fun sandbox without any reason to door anything.

I haven't had this much fun figuring out a sandbox game since the original KSP.  And I don't think I've even scratched the surface yet.  

The low poly art style works really well in this game, and I think it looks the best of other physics heavy games that use the same style. 

As someone who likes to use the tech tree to gradually expose new levels of details as I learn, it would be cool to be a little more customization in the number of starting research points and other parameters around that.  Nothing is more paralyzing to my ADHD than starting with a huge parts library I know nothing about.

I followed this game for awhile before finally pulling the trigger, great jobs to the devs for developing quite the expansive and fun world to figure out.  Would recommend to any player that is motivated and intrigued by having no idea what they are doing.

Two months ago or so, the space DLC was released. With that, there were updates made to the fluid mechanics and a new addition being pressurization, which has changed how many creations on the workshop function, how submarines are able to function, and the buoyancy of most vehicles. On release, this broke many creations to the point that they were unusable. Previously functioning creations now simply sank or rolled over instantly because of the changes. Eventually, devs released a fix to the buoyancy mechanics, though many creations still do not function properly as they once did, and others still behave differently than they should.

More frustratingly for me -- I've always loved the destruction aspects of the game, the ability to have megalodons spawn in and attack your ships, ship collisions cause them to take on water and eventually sink, and with weapons, having naval combat was finally a possibility. While other games like sea of thieves exist for more tryhard competitive players, this was one of those games I'd hop on for a few hours a week to mess around in sandbox and sink ships, then return every few weeks to see what was new on the workshop and experiment with other user's creations. Now, not only are a good number of workshop creations completely unusable, but a recent update in these last two months (or collection of updates) have made it so that even fully destroyed vessels, do not take on water or sink. You could open every door on the ship, capsize it, blow it full of holes, and it will stay afloat as if nothing had happened (although electronics, engines, or other systems can be fully inoperable), nothing can really get them to consistently sink anymore. I've found maybe two out of dozens of creations that if left long enough fully submerged, will eventually flood inside, only through left open doors and nothing else, damage alone still won't cause them to flood.

My guess is the new pressurization mechanic is preventing air from escaping through damaged blocks, despite water previously being able to travel through those blocks, air cannot, meaning that the pressure within the vessel stays the same and water won't flood the ship. Even the ships that are fully submerged or capsized with doors opened, the pressure seems to prevent air from exiting and allowing water due to some limitation in coding or the game engine. I've asked around on reddit, the official discord, and steam discussions to see if other players are having the same issues, and it seems a good number of people (those who arent playing just for the ""rescue"" larping side) have said they cant get ships to sink anymore either.

Really unfortunate but to enjoy a game and support it for so many years, just for a core mechanic to be changed in such a way that it takes all the joy of what you enjoyed about the game in the first place, is really disappointing. Not only should this had been tested in beta before release, but the fact that it hasn't been rolled back over the months following release until the mechanic actually functions properly, is mind boggling. Some find enjoyment from it, but in practicality, there is nothing to explore in space and the change to include pressurization in the game adds nothing, it's only broken more creations than whatever they were trying to introduce, so it should just be removed at this point.

Sad to say that I won't be touching this game again until they can get it fixed, but with how slow they are to roll out changes such as this, it'll probably be a few more months before it's even looked at.",1703580120,1703580120,False,7,0,0.506150245666503906,0,True,True,False

Edit 10/18/2022: Fix your game, bugs everywhere, even ones from version 1.0.

Edit 7/9/2023: We are up to 1.8.3 & this game is still an unacceptably buggy mess. The DLCs too should have been part of the base game & not separate. Additionally the dedicated server configuration file still lacks details & settings, the command prompt of the server spits out no information whatsoever to tell you of any errors or information while the server is live, the game is clunky with gameplay & controls; it all feels unnecessarily stiff, the server performs noticeably poor even with excellent hardware (movement is not smooth, stutters in physics & position updates are still noticeable, server slowing to an absolute crawl not even thirty minutes into hosting for no logical nor visible reason), & AI are still horrendous with pathing. So much that could be improved, but with every update the game is not being optimized or improved upon outside of additional small amounts of content. Not sure what they are doing, but it definitely feels like the potential this game has is being wasted. It is not a bad game & I genuinely really want to see the game succeed, but there are improvements that the community has continuously asked for & have gone blatantly ignored. Hopefully in a few more years things will have improved, but overall, it feels like a different individual or team could have done far better with the concept of this game; no offense to the developers there who are 'actually' trying.

Edit 7/10/2023: The dedicated server, or if hosted client side, or even just playing using the client in general; crashes way too often. The dedicated server crashes much more frequently.
Been trying to catch up on news, discussions, & articles surrounding the game; only to find out that the developers bascially do not care, have a new game in the works already, & from what I could read; are abandoning optimizing this game in favor for the new game just because they can. Stormworks was in Early Access for a very long time, it is shameful that they did not fix their game & it is pathetic of them that they are going this route.

They literally have players petitioning against them to fix their game because of how problematic the Stormworks development team have been treating the game & community. The community is passionate about Stormworks & just want a stable game, it is disappointing that the development team do not share the same interests or goals.

As an update to the review was written, the dedicated server I have for Stormworks crashed not even ten minutes after relaunching it & no-one was even on it yet. Not stable at all & honestly never has been from recollection.

After hosting via the client instead, & in another attempt, even joining someone else's server to hopefully avoid the issues, the game physics would still slow to a crawl even with the DLCs disabled. I say whole-heartedly, with a great passion for the game, to avoid it. As-is, as it has been for years, it is a great concept, but not worth your time, not from the lack of care the team puts in to optimizing the game. They have had years to fix a lot of these issues, & they choose not to. They had Early Access, & squandered it. They still have the opportunity to, but with the track record they are presenting to the community, I'm not sure what future projects they endeavor will get the same positive reception that Stormworks 'could' have gotten yet failed to uphold when it comes to an optimized experience, though with the way this game is performing without the much needed optimizations & fixes, it would not be wise to purchase what they come out with next until they fix the blaring problems this game has had for years.

It has not even been forty-eight hours since I returned to giving this game the best of an attempt to even be able to play it, & it has been an absolutely unacceptable experience that I really wish no-one else has to go through themselves. The issues with this game need to be fixed & resolved before the developers move on to their next title, DLC, or content update; because this seems to continually reflect severely against whatever they come out with next with every update, based on what other reviewers & discussions have said.

Great concept, lots of content, extremely unplayable lack of optimizations. That is the experience I was given.

Edit July 21rst, 2023: ""v1.8.4-5 - The Critical Fix Update!"" Fixes things no-one asked to be fixed. Fix the multiplayer instead, come on.

Edit December 25, 2023; all the same issues as before, except now even the game itself crashes more than the fresh dedicated server, & things like NPCs, their vehicles, minerals, & so on all despawn way too fast. Tons of great ideas & aspirations, but truly incompetent implementations.",1584847105,1703503881,False,11,0,0.495013147592544556,0,True,False,False

- Engineering
- Programming
- Automation

But even you don't have some knowledge about these subjects and probably many others involved you can still enjoy the game by adding amazing creations from the workshop, and it has a lot of flavors, from simple easy to play creations to more advanced and near realistic creations from players who push the game to its limits bringing you a car, ship, boat, airplane, helicopter and many more with complex systems to help you in your rescue missions or not.

Game is very educational cus it's not forgiving you gotta build your craft right with the systems needed for a functioning stable vehicle otherwise you might get frustrated when building your own creations.

Stormworks is one, if not the best game i have ever played, but takes a while to master the building area of the game. However for people who struggle to build the workshop is available to all players, giving them hundreds, or thousands of free vehicles to play with. Though, one area that needs to be focused on is multiplayer, as it has alot of problems, and barely runs at its maximum of 60fps, and stormworks also needs quite a good computer to run at respectable frames, letalone host a multiplayer server for you and your friends. It runs alright for me, as i have an rtx 30 series, but still drags behind in multiplayer.

Overall, Stormworks is a fantastic game if you love all things vehicles, and is a very good price to pay for the hours of enjoyment you will get out of it. Keep in mind, that this is only my opinion, and that you may find you have a different experience. I reccomend watching some youtube videos to find out more about stormworks before you buy it, and some tutorials on how to build to help you get started. I used to use tutorials alot when i started, and it has helped me build my own origional creations for me to use. 


The DLCs have there ups, and downs. Personally, the only DLC I do not regret buying is the Search and Destroy DLC, which adds content that really should be in the game as default. The Industrial DLC is quite good, and adds a large new island, but I do partially regret it. For this one, Id personally only get it if I had the money laying around.  The space DLC i completely regret buying. I do not use it, and haven't really since purchase. It is full of bugs, and the amount of content you get for the price you pay is certainly not worth it. All things considered, the addition of an atmosphere is one I do like, but not enough to spend almost $10 on.

The issues are:
 - My boat starts off being half underwater. 
 - After putting out the fire, I can't get the survivors to walk with me to the hospital. Apparently they can't jump like I do.
 - Fine. So I got them to get into the boat, which itself is a hassle. Then when I reached the pier, I asked them to follow me but they just won't jump into the water. I guess I have to park my boat within 3 feet of the pier.

So the first mission is already a pain. Refunded.",1703349984,1703349984,False,4,0,0.489448249340057373,0,True,False,False

   - 3 x 1 blocks have yet to be introduced.

(Talking about the space and physics update.) However whenever I play I feel as if I'm on an endless loop trying to figure out what to even do. That ship you've been using for possibly a year now, broken due to physics. Want to use a train? Too bad you can only pull three coaches before the entire engine is overloaded and goes like 20 kilometres an hour. Planes? Absolutely horrid to control even with some of the good ones I've seen on the workshop that are far better than anything I can build.

Optimization? Never heard of it. The multiplayer is only good if everybody in the server has a decent PC and CPU optimization is terrible. If you want more than like 3 or 4 people on one server not only do you all need a decent PC but there are not even options for kicking, banning, etc so you best trust them. The game tends to also randomly crash or even bug you randomly through the floor.

Building in this game ""might"" be one of the only good aspects. It's quite natural despite the terrible rotate controls and fear of it being broken due to updates. I will always tend to use engines or other equipment from the workshop however due to my issues of trying to build a compact diesel engine or anything of the sorts. Other than that, I've been stuck on building projects with no motivation because of not wanting to go through the mental pain of the rotation in this game.

I've also heard the community for the most part sucks. People in the OFFICIAL discord server getting muted for trying to stop arguments. Mods abusing their power more than communist dictators and painting a ""good"" image of themselves. Not to mention I've seen drama between two mod creators and mod creators leaving due to Stormworks being a buggy uncooperative mess.

Additionally, the DLC aspect is quite greedy. I feel as if most if not all the DLC should've became an update or are just not worth ten dollars for what you get. While the DLC tangent is for it's own review, Industrial Frontier is more or less another continent which is okay but extremely time consuming to actually do industrial things such as mining, refining, etc. The Weapons DLC isn't worth ten dollars due to it simply being guns, bombs, and fightable AI that I assure you'll turn off due to it being annoying. I don't even own the Space DLC as I'm certain it's a waste of my time. I haven't even heard a single good thing about it myself.

Overall, I'd recommend staying away from this game unless you're going to play multiplayer or are certain that you still want to play it despite all the bugs and issues above. Multiplayer is the only thing saving this game for me, although it still absolutely sucks. It's almost addicting because I just want to find one damn thing that works in this entire game. It's quite sad how devoted I am in an endless cycle. Quite literally the definition of insanity and addiction.",1703276787,1703276787,False,3,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Okay, this game is something else to be honest. It has its ups and downs, as someone who has played this game since it was really playable, bought all the DLC's bought friends the game and DLC's I think its time to make a review about this game.

 Lets first start off with the developers, Geometa, I feel like they really dont pay attention to their own game sometimes, the bugs, broken DLC's (Space DLC *Cough Cough*), and just broken stuff that shouldn't be broken, ie. The space DLC, Yes it's fixed now, but it broke the entire game essentially, Jet engines, Steam engines, Boats dont float anymore, etc. Essentially paying 10$ to ""upgrade"" your game to an unplayable game. Yes, I understand they fixed it, apologized, etc. But still, C'mon atleast make sure you are uploading the right version to steam/making sure it uploaded correctly, Now I'm no steam developer so I don't understand this topic very well, but c'mon this is a first for me.

[h2] Moving on... [/h2]

 Now after that rant about the developers, Lets discuss the actual game and the state(s) of the game. First off, I personally really enjoy Stormworks still, My friends can agree, the game is genuinely a really good game to mess around, build stuff, blow stuff up, fight, go to the moon, mine, oil, etc. to your hearts content, and you can do this all with friends![u] BUT [/u] It isn't all good, That's me sugar coating it and listing just the pros. and the DLC's with questionable amounts of content and actually content.

So.. The DLC's... Let's start with the first DLC, The Weapons DLC(Search and Destroy). Now why in your absolute mind would you need guns and bombs and EMP's and autocannons and guns so big you can fit a whole human in it in a[i][b][u] Search and rescue[/u][/b][/i] game? well I honestly don't know, Stormworks has turned over the years from a rescue game to a game where the campaign mode is actually going out and saving/rescuing people which is pretty fun sometimes to a sandbox where you can instead of saving people killing them lmao, I'm not really mad about it as I understand that you can only do so much with a rescue sandbox game, but guns? really? atleast release something that is less violent first to a game about saving people before you introduce killing people lol. But now, about the weapons DLC itself I personally do really like the addition as someone who loves warfare and anything to do with it, and i believe a lot of others can agree out of the 3 DLC's it is the best as it adds solid content that is pretty fun(Blowing up your friends helicopter by strapping C4 to it and watching as they are confused and end up laughing it off) I have made a lot of fun memories with the DLC so personally I would recommend it. TL;DR Additions: Loads of guns, explosives, and other goodies that can be fun in multiplayer. (No map expansions or anything else really just guns , armor, and a decent selection of handheld items) Rating: 9/10

 Second in line... The Industrial Frontier update! or shall i say The Frontier update as its a little lack luster. Yes, it adds a whole new island doubling the amount of land(excluding the arctic kinda) but it really doesnt add too much else, yes it adds oil refining and mining, but thats all stuff that isn't really a addition that makes sense for this game, yes the open barren land is fun to test on and its ton of rail networks for trains(personally my pick for building/messing around) with trains, and it adds a lot of other things, but i feel like it was a little bit of a cash grab, its not really needed, yes its nice and if you like the game and see that as a pro for you get it, It doesn't ruin the game or anything like a specific other DLC. Overrall I wouldn't recommend it if you had to pick a DLC to buy. TL;DR Additions: A new island mostly barren, Oil stuff, Mining stuff, aka in campaign more money options i guess and can be useful when you eventually run out of fuel and cant really buy anymore (I will add on about that later) Rating: 5/10

Finally, the most recent addition to stormworks, The Space DLC. This is going to be a interesting one and most likely the longest one. I personally was pretty excited seeing the trailer for this DLC as it actually looked polished, and really cool. But I was clearly proved wrong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgpAPUgNZDM
You can watch that to see what I mean or not It's up to you, But to say, It looked impressive considering Geometa, But clearly something happened and on release day it basically ruined the game. To begin, You wanna fly a plane over 10 feet? too bad your engine is gonna flame out and not work. You wanna test your ship? Too bad. It's going to sink and not work. Trying to make a steam train? Cool but no boilers just don't work lol. whoaaaa is that a modular engine??? NO. To be quick about that. Pretty much, It broke the whole game. Now once they actually fixed that, the DLC and free update actually added some nice things that fit in and are useful, ie. Atmosphere! you can't fly as high and you're engines will flame out if you go to high(now that it actually works)  and a bunch of other goodies (re working the rocket engines which were for some reason in the base game lol) Now to the actual DLC content.. So. Space. Interesting for a rescue game. I mean I guess you can go rescue a failed moon mission or something lol? but like why space? what makes you think a rescue game needs space lol. but before I talk about other stuff, What it added.. Space of course, Liquid fuel and oxidizer which I think is pretty neat Reaction Control Systems(RCS) Atmosphere, Pressure, The moon(You get a little plot of land on moon its big yes, has things to explore, caves and more but to be clear NO you do not get to explore the entire moon sadly.) I'll be pretty quick with this but the actual getting to the moon part is mostly straight forward, you just fly up and eventually your rocket will be mysteriously guided to the moon no questions asked lol. So the whole space part and moon, I think its pretty fun, tho buggy(on the day it came out in multiplayer servers which is a whole different topic if someone who isn't host decided to try and walk on the moon they would just fall through and die essentially, as well if you get out of a seat sometimes you will just yk phase through a wall and fly out of the rocket making you have to essentially reset( highly annoying with friends who cant keep themselves seating for the life of them ) Now, I haven't played the game that much after that update as I just haven't had motivation so I will leave this section here as I don't want to assume anything and be wrong so sorry if you want to know more about this DLC's current state you will have to dig through more reviews lol. TL;DR Addions: Space! liquid fuel, (Oxidizer etc.), Pressure, Atmosphere, and some other goodies(handheld items suits etc.). Now my rating. This one is going to be a bit harsh and most likely inaccurate to what it currently is so take it with a grain of salt, but a 6/10 I feel like if the devs get their sh*t togethor and fix the update (Yes I am aware they fixed the game breaking ""features"") Maybe they have fixed the update in certain ways or maybe they haven't but I feel that's a pretty reasonable rating. 

[h2] Now The Base Game. [/h2]

This will be a tough topic as someone who has loved this game hated this game quit this game came back to this game I think in general, it's a good game at first glance, but to an extent it's the result of a project that was promising that failed in a way, The Dev's cant really fix the game in its current state without making a completely new game as they have stated so some of these bugs and other things that bring the game down are just gonna have to stay. Sadly this review is going to have to be cut off as steam limits how much i can type but overrall, 8/10 so i guess this is a DLC review.",1672532120,1703129904,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

but recently that doesn't even apply to me anymore, with each update it seems that the devs deviate more and more from the main objective of the game, to begin with I only play singleplayer, because not only does multiplayer often have a bad performance for me because of the way this game deals with the world and other players, but the singleplayer itself, which i was often never able to play above 40 fps even on the day I bought this game, and if it was just 40 fps it would still be great, because this game has the thing that if it detects a lag, the speed is reduced and the game becomes slow motion, which despite being a good way to control performance, no matter what graphics setting i use, it can be ultra or low, view distance at maximum or at minimum, the resolution can be a 16p or 4k, the game simply stays between 40 and 30 fps, and nothing I do resolves this, making what I play torturing to myself at times when the physics simulation starts to prove too much for the game to hold on.

not mentioning me and a friend bought it to play together, something we never did because of lag.

At first I was able to overlook it, but seeing that the devs prefer to release dlcs that deviate from the game's original purpose of being a rescue simulator makes me lose hope, back at the time of the dlc that adds weapons, the devs said they would make it paid because they thought it wasn't in the main objective of the game to have guns and they wanted to see which players would actually be willing to pay to have this in the game, to a certain point I think this is reasonable but just look at the amount of dlc that the game has at the moment and you can see why it is a problem now.

Maybe one day they will fix the performance problems, especially in multiplayer but until then I consider it playable for a limited time, I would honestly ask for a refund if I didn't have 77 hours and it hadn't been so many years since I had this game, it's truly frustrating.

If you want to play I think you can have fun but for me this is honestly unacceptable, and as much as I really like the game I wouldn't recommend a slow motion rescue game with the performance equivalent to Crysis to anyone.",1703011462,1703012585,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yesterday I shot a missile against a ship (npc one, war crimes yipeee) and my pc fucking screamed in agony, it didn't lag this much even when one time I was literally making a model on blender with like 323876 vertices while simultaneously running an instace of shaded minecraft in 4K (I'm not joking this is fucking real). This game has 0(zero) graphics to brag about and it runs worst then my unoptimized piece of shit game I made on unity just to try it out.

Now if you excuse me I'm going to play it regardless because I'm stupid and the game it's fucking amazing.

Fix your unoptimized crap game. Everybody is saying it, EVERYBODY. Stop rolling updates with random shit in them.

Sincerely :)

2023-11-30: It has come to my attention, through the various things I read and experienced, that the devs seem to actively dislike bug reports, one of the most eye-opening of which being this: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormworks/comments/v6z3l0/rejected_defect_reports_are_considered_as_spam/
The devs/mods claim to care, but that's hard to believe with ridiculousness like this. How petty is a shadow-mute? I mean come on, if they're a problem, grow a pair and ban 'em, or at the very least explain the problem with their post. You might ask why I still play after this review. That's because I have hope even for these people and will still check on things to see if they have changed. But I cannot recommend a game with this attitude towards people who care so deeply about the game that they take time not to complain about bugs, but to make a helpful report so they devs can identify and more easily fix an issue (if they cared). Very disappointing.

2023-11-25: The devs are *trying* to fix the fluid system, with some success, but still quite a bit of weirdness, especially at high pressure e.g. bilge pumps on a submerged sub. Mechanical systems are still weird, though I hope with the space update they fix the aerodynamics.

EDIT:
This game has worn thin on me. The bugs, the exploits, and the continual shoddiness of the implementations of so many facets of the physics and rotary power systems has made it lose its appeal to me. And to be fair, it's not because these problems exist that I no longer like the game, it's that the developers don't even seem to care about these problems which has really disheartened me. In some aspects of the game, the pressure/fluid system and entire steam system for example, when using common sense physics to improve their operation, either no change is made or they perform even worse as a result. And I don't want to hate this game, I want it to be good, and I hope one day the devs make an effort to do so. But until there is an *actual* physics system, not the current mess they have now with infinite power generators and messed up aerodynamics and the other aforementioned problems, I can't enjoy this game to its full potential. To the KSP fans out there, the physics suck, and to the Space Engineers fans, the physics isn't as bad as Space Engineers, but it's not far off. Also, everything in my previous review still holds true, and if you can look past the arguably egregious implementations of certain parts of the game, more power to you, just be warned.

Old review below:

Ok, so I got this 8 days ago, and I have over 80 hours, so there is that. I've found this game extremely fascinating, the engineer in me loves it. It's so multi-faceted and complex it'll take a while to get burnt out on this. I find the linkage mechanism of logic (data mostly) absolutely great for the level of configuration and customization you can do to a vehicle (in the complex ones it's just nuts). And then the logic blocks themselves, which you could literally build a computer out of. And to take it another level, the microcontrollers allow you to make YOUR OWN logic blocks, which are basically a combination of the individual ones wrapped up into a single one wired exactly (or close enough) to how you want it. I've literally seen microcontrollers set up to look like they're booting Windows XP. That said to get to that point requires *just* a *tiny* bit of brainpower and experience in the game, and for all I know probably lua skills as well (the game has lua script blocks). Would highly recommend if you've played KSP and Space Engineers and enjoyed both.",1623133757,1702516156,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Sadly soon after I bought the game I have come to the conclusion that the Devs don't give a shit about the community and all they care about is sweet dlc money.
The biggest hit for me was the update that came with Space DLC. It broke literally every good creation i have.
From jets to boats to minivans, literally nothing works. They have fixed some of the major issues but still the game isn't in a very good state.

By far one of the things that still upsets me about the new update is how they decided to make some things just more annoying. Like, WHY GEOMETA, WHY DID YOU MAKE THE RADIATOR SPAWN WITH AIR.

Anyways thats it. To anyone who reads this keep review bombing this game until they fix stuff and make the game decent again.

Why does maintaining safe gas compositions and pressures inside cabins and fuel tanks require realistic ventilation systems when you can make an ultra-efficient jet engine by removing the intake and exhaust then sealing it into a box? It seems it's realistic in all of the ways that are annoying and in none of the ways that make gameplay a fun challenge.
Any time I try to think outside the box to engineer something, some sort of bug gets in the way; meanwhile simply doing things the cheaty, easy way that shouldn't even be possible with the physics engine work instantly and for good.

All of this, plus the developer team...I've excused their practices for a couple of years by now. Over those years I've submitted bug and feature claims for issues that quite badly affected me, for them to close my tickets immediately, either with no reason given or saying that they're duplicates of claims of similar yet very different problems.

Oh yeah, and multiplayer. I imagined it would be the best part of a game like this, theoretically infinite possibilities... You can barely do anything because it's implemented so poorly. What a shame.

[list]
[*] Vehicle building
The game hands you quests that imply one or other kind of a vehicle, but it's not [i]too[/i] rigid in terms of rules - you can build a variety of silly vehicles that'll still work.
[*] Visuals
It's a coherent, not-too-detailed low-poly style that creates a variety of screenshot-worthy scenes during different weather conditions.
[*] You can kind of bunny-hop (jumping roughly the moment you land lets you build up momentum) and it is lovely.
[/list]
What I don't like about this game:
[list]
[*] For me and friend, netcode either works perfectly fine or starts off horribly laggy (with client suffering from >10s worth of latency) and slowly fixes itself over course of an hour or so.
[*] It can be hard to figure out why something doesn't work.
Your best bet is ""advanced tooltips"", but that doesn't necessarily answer why your little engine is overheating despite having three radiators with fans connected to it.
[*] The default ""career"" mode is a bit of a mess in terms of configuration, with multiple opportunities to soft-lock yourself, even during the tutorial.
[*] The game doesn't always explain itself very well and some bits can only be figured out through trial and error or by looking for information online.
[/list]
To have a reasonably good time, I recommend playing in ""custom"" mode with
[list]
[*] Money enabled
[*] Research enabled
[*] Infinite fuel enabled at the start, or even in general
By default, each base has a fixed amount of fuel and you need to build a fuel tanker kind of a boat to buy more somewhere - possibly a real-life hour drive away.
[/list]
Unlike ""career"", you can also change settings on the fly (like enable/disable on-demand player/vehicle teleporation), which you will occasionally need because this is a game with physics and it is possible to get stuck inside solids with sufficiently poor luck.

All in all, it is good fun, but with some caveats.

[h2]Update[/h2]
Having played the game some more, it feels like each subsequent system is slightly more obscure than the last:
[list]
[*] Boats are good and work generally like you expect
[*] Cars work [i]mostly[/i] like you expect, but fast cars require sticking plane-specific parts on them due to fast movement creating some sort of a lift effect (thus losing grip with the road).
[*] Trains are really cool and it is good fun making vehicles to load/unload cargo onto trains, but multi-car trains tend to get stuck at specific locations ([url=https://geometa.co.uk/support/stormworks/22315]sample[/url]).
[*] Helicopters are a bit of a mystery since most of their physics aren't actual physics (you can even lift a helicopter [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormworks/comments/17k5inq/behold_my_worst_invention_yet_the_crankopter/]with a hand crank[/url]!), but at least someone wrote a guide that still works.
[*] Planes are an even greater mystery as the few still-functioning tutorials were clearly made for sandbox (infinite fuel and/or non-exploding engines), and it is hard to find a simple reference plane that doesn't overheat and explode after balance changes across the years-worth of game versions.
[*] Oil spill cleanup is a hypothetically interesting mechanic, but it's hard to tell whether your separator works at all, and a big tedium to drive your boat to the nearest oil spill after each change.
And then all of this is less effective than a simple tank that pumps the water near the top and pumps it out at the bottom (thus slowly filling up with oil due to density difference).
[*] Not really looking forward to figuring out the space stuff, so we moved on to other games.

573090,152075994,76561198041983381,764,16,7723,0,7677,1707289652,"Missions are poorly implemented, extrinsic motivators are poorly designed, the research system is godawful, progression is both at a snails-pace AND nearly non-existent, and the money system is a joke... these are the very basic problems with Stormworks.

That being said, the game's intrinsic rewards are amazing. It feels remarkable when a microcontroller comes together, or when you get your digital devices to work. Heck, even getting some vehicles to even move feels like a massive achievement. You have to create intricate designs if you want robust performance, and that's refreshing and exhilarating when it all comes together.

Problem is there's nothing to use these vehicles on, I'm consistently bored in this game once I'm done building. People have problems with fluid dynamics, hydraulics, and simulation, but I've never had issues with any of those because I've never gotten far enough in the ""campaign"" to notice. This is because missions are drip fed to the player; you spend a lot of time out of the building screen sleeping or waiting for new missions to arrive. Only to find out that, once they arrive, they're much too far, or they're much too tedious. Thus, you have to make your own goals, but since the only resources are money and research and the latter can be only acquired from missions, there's nothing to focus on besides making money.

Now, there are plenty of games where the primary focus is to make money. In those games, you often make money so you can explore more, or buy cooler stuff so you can do crazier things. I can't figure out the reason to make money in Stormworks, so you can build massive trains to ship oil? So you can go further and explore more of the game's barren world? You can build a lot of things with a minuscule amount of cash. Sure, you won't be able to get far or ship goods, but both exploration and shipping are not compelling enough reasons to want to make money. The shipping requires huge amounts of resources for simply more resources, and the exploration is lackluster since the devs refuse to put anything remotely interactive in the game outside resource nodes and aforementioned drip fed missions. The world is barren and huge and there's little reason to interact with it outside missions. There are no NPCs, just tiny towns and similar terrain as far as the eye can see.

Funnily enough I haven't even gotten into the DLCs yet, which are all terrible. Though, none of them are actually too bad in a vacuum, problem is they exist in a SEARCH AND RESCUE game and are clear indicator that the devs either have no idea what they're doing, or pushing out low grade content just to make a quick buck. Again, none of them are terrible, the space DLC is actually kinda funny since it just adds even more empty space to do nothing in, but adds plenty of new functional objects to build with, kinda like a microcosm of the entire issue with the game. But I digress, the issue isn't with the DLCs themselves, but the fact that they've come out for an unfinished product. If you bought this game and played it, especially just the base game, you'd have a hard time believing it was finished. It feels like a prototype, a very impressive personal project. It's good for simulation purposes, but not worth getting invested in. Then you realize there are 3 DLC which basically expand the breadth of the game 3 fold, but still gives it very little depth outside its given mechanical depth. The DLCs are tone deaf, but more so the second and third, since they followed the same line of thought as the first, but with less interactivity. The first added combat, and despite being for a game centered on rescuing people from disaster zones, it was a new mechanic a player could take part in a campaign. Again though, it brings very little in terms of rewards, it's kind of just a playground to shoot (and get shot) in. Once again a shallow experience. The second and third are less notable. The second is about resource extraction and the third is about space travel. The resource extraction is again another shallow mechanic the player can interact with to attain more money, which in turn is used for nothing. The space DLC.... well I'm not sure what that adds mechanic wise.

Essentially, you should play this game in creative mode, since all the challenges present and worth doing in the campaign are also available there, just without the headache of travelling and having to do really terrible missions in order to do the ones you want to do.

Better yet, don't buy this game. Don't waste your cash until they make the game into... well, a game. Not unless you really like building just for the sake of building.",1701017244,1702056551,False,3,0,0.527629256248474121,0,True,False,False

For the first week we got nothing from the devs, then out of nowhere they released a patch that fixed a lot of the bugs, however, the majority of the most popular creations which were broken by the update are still broken today because the people who made them have had enough of the devs constantly destroying the games physics.

Even new creators are barely making vehicles like there used to be years ago and even if there's something really good on there, no-one is downloading it cuz they've grown tired of the devs destroying them.

But now I logged over 1'000h within a short time. And considering it soon became the one game I spent most of my time online in, the Devs have done something right.

Even though it looks disapoint at first, Stormworks offers the player a huge, living world. But it's strenght lies in the vehicle editor, where you can create whatever means of transport you can imagine (or a base too, if it's what you like).

With it's custom controls, it's easy editor and the simple logic, you can design craft control to the depth you desire. You can use simple dials for your vehicle speed, or choose to use advanced logic to display information on intrinsic screens, overlay on live camera feeds.

If you enjoyed LEGO or even are a fan of Mindstorms and like to program some creation of yours, than this is the perfect game for you. In Stormworks, you can not only build something to roughly looks the way you want, it can also WORK the way you want. And not just to pretend doing something like in other sandbox games. The world is full of missions and things to do for you and your creation. From rescueing, trading, exploring, drilling and refining oil, even fighting, you can actually test how your creation performs and improve on your design.

Even if you don't like tinkering almost as long in the editor as just playing the game, there are A LOT of workshop creations. Some amazing stuff there, that just invites you to play around. And for free!

Sometimes, the Devs release a poorly tested updates. This happened and probably happens again, but they're eager to get their baby working again. Don't expect a perfect game. It has flaws here and there, but with the amount you can do now, it really just the minority of things that don't work, compared to things you can actually have fun with.

The best vehicle sandbox I encountered so far. With it's newest DLC, you can build boats, cars, trains, helicopters, planes, hovercraft, bases, and now even rockets and space ships.

Its one of those games I want to keep playing, but I find myself getting tired after 10 minutes of playing.

Like, why do I need to design a microcontroller just to made the instrument panel work? I could understand if you wanted to do something complicated with the block, but if I just want something like a switch and some dials, it's really tedious. Why can't it just have their own regular and separate inputs and outputs like every other block? Why don't regular components like engines, wheels, gears, clutches etc. have build in options that you can tweak? Why do they too require you to create your own microcontrollers? And why can I not just pick up a piece and move it somewhere else on my vehicle? Who do I have to use a special cut/paste tool just to do that? I can always delete the block and place a new one where I want it, but then I'd have to do all the wiring all over again.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

However, I cannot give this a positive review, it's a good game, but it just gets more and more broken each update. So many things have gone wrong, like when they released the space DLC, they basically make all boats, planes and helicopters unusable, the game has been slowly fixed, but it hasn't been the same since. Modular engines are also very difficult to cool, way harder then they should be, they are virtually unusable. Multiplayer is also a huge mess.

Is it fun to play? Yes, but every update, something else breaks.",1701711300,1701711300,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Most of the time I've heard as well, is that some DLCs aren't even worked on or updated, and most things on the workshop need certain DLCs and the DLCs make the game feel more full.

Two months ago or so, the space DLC was released. With that, there were updates made to the fluid mechanics and a new addition being pressurization, which has changed how many creations on the workshop function, how submarines are able to function, and the buoyancy of most vehicles. On release, this broke many creations to the point that they were unusable. Previously functioning creations now simply sank or rolled over instantly because of the changes. Eventually, devs released a fix to the buoyancy mechanics, though many creations still do not function properly as they once did, and others still behave differently than they should. 

More frustratingly for me -- I've always loved the destruction aspects of the game, the ability to have megalodons spawn in and attack your ships, ship collisions cause them to take on water and eventually sink, and with weapons, having naval combat was finally a possibility. While other games like sea of thieves exist for more tryhard competitive players, this was one of those games I'd hop on for a few hours a week to mess around in sandbox and sink ships, then return every few weeks to see what was new on the workshop and experiment with other user's creations. Now, not only are a good number of workshop creations completely unusable, but a recent update in these last two months (or collection of updates) have made it so that even fully destroyed vessels, do not take on water or sink. You could open every door on the ship, capsize it, blow it full of holes, and it will stay afloat as if nothing had happened (although electronics, engines, or other systems can be fully inoperable), nothing can really get them to consistently sink anymore. I've found maybe two out of dozens of creations that if left long enough fully submerged, will eventually flood inside, only through left open doors and nothing else, damage alone still won't cause them to flood. 

My guess is the new pressurization mechanic is preventing air from escaping through damaged blocks, despite water previously being able to travel through those blocks, air cannot, meaning that the pressure within the vessel stays the same and water won't flood the ship. Even the ships that are fully submerged or capsized with doors opened, the pressure seems to prevent air from exiting and allowing water due to some limitation in coding or the game engine. I've asked around on reddit, the official discord, and steam discussions to see if other players are having the same issues, and it seems a good number of people (those who arent playing just for the ""rescue"" larping side) have said they cant get ships to sink anymore either. 

Really unfortunate but to enjoy a game and support it for so many years, just for a core mechanic to be changed in such a way that it takes all the joy of what you enjoyed about the game in the first place, is really disappointing. Not only should this had been tested in beta before release, but the fact that it hasn't been rolled back over the months following release until the mechanic actually functions properly, is mind boggling. Some find enjoyment from it, but in practicality, there is nothing to explore in space and the change to include pressurization in the game adds nothing, it's only broken more creations than whatever they were trying to introduce, so it should just be removed at this point. 

Sad to say that I won't be touching this game again until they can get it fixed, but with how slow they are to roll out changes such as this, it'll probably be a few more months before it's even looked at.",1701318570,1701318570,False,73,3,0.754352390766143799,0,True,False,False

While it could be fun to create machines in ""creative"" I found it a lot more interesting to have the restrictions of a Career mode limiting how many resources I could use to build my vehicles to do the things the game required of me.

They're saying they'll fix the game, and if it ends up being a fun and playable game again I might change this review. I do not feel optimistic about this, however. Though as has been written ""No man can walk so long in the Shadow that he cannot come again to the Light"". But it will require actions to prove it. [i]If[/i] they can get it back to the enjoyable state it was in when I first played it with the performance and such I'll be surprised and happy.

The DLC they have released have been so contrary to the spirit of the game that it's insane as well.

The search and destroy DLC is all fine and well, could use more content like handheld launchers and such, but overall pretty good.
The Industrial Frontier DLC, I do like that it adds more stuff to do on land rather than just swimming out in the ocean.
The Space DLC, don't have it, can't say much, just seems a little far fetched.

It would be nice to see the devs add something like a fishing mechanic to the game, expand the ocean gameplay a little more, maybe work a little on the NPCs. But generally a solid 8/10 game.",1656105538,1700863921,True,0,0,0.48310813307762146,0,True,False,False

Edit: A lot of the multiplayer issues have been addressed, with some fixes. The game is playable in multiplayer again. It still needs a lot of work as far as multiplayer optimization goes, but the devs have taken many steps to address these issues, and seem to have a plan to fix them.

The Weapons DLC was a bit lacking, honestly. This new Industry DLC however, seems to show a lot of promise! 

I love this game. I've had it for a long time, and I have 700ish hours in game. [strike]That being said, I can not with a good conscience recommend this game for anyone, unless you only intend on a SINGLE PLAYER experience. The multiplayer experience for this game has been TERRIBLE. Servers lag really badly, and tons of netcode issues exist for servers. 

Despite these issues, the devs are instead focusing on controller integration (should have been done a year ago) and making krakens. [/strike]

The devs have released a multiplayer update, which does address some of the issues peer to peer. That being said, it is too little, too late. Dedicated servers still have many issues that need to be fixed, [strike]yet the devs are still pumping out cosmetic and un-needed updates.[/strike]

I was just trying to build a boat, but for some reason if I deleted a radiator my character was unable to activate any buttons on the vehicle anymore. Placing new buttons didn't solve it, placing new radiators didn't solve it.

I'm just sick of the overly and unecessarily complicated mechanics and features that don't seem to work.

I'm a big fan of this game, it's my most played game on steam, I usually enjoy it but the physics in game are why I'm not recommending it anymore, I was happily building aircraft without a care in the world but when i tried to test it out, I was always pulling up, no matter if i used any control surface any physics difficulty or anything.

REVIEW UPDATE (Negative): What came up as a coast guard game has evolved into ""Player oriented"" crap that is trying to go to space. Meanwhile breaking every known mechanic that was fixed with rigorous effort over the years just to get more money by selling a useless DLC. This game is no more fun. Forget it...


OLD REVIEW (Positive): A game like many other games that you built vehicles from ground up. Only difference is that you actually need to build them in such a way that they need to be useful, for you need to use them to accomplish certain tasks like towing seagoing vessels (Boats mostly), save stranded people, extinguish fires or carry heavy loads, liquid or solid. Also, you are not bound to ground for these tasks, planes and helicopters are also welcome.

Workshop has quite a selection of both real life recreations of famous vessels, or just imaginary wonders of creative geniuses.

If you like these kind of games, give it a try. But be warned, some technical details are confusing and necessary to just move your vehicle (Like gearboxes or piping and even hydro-dynamics) but there are plenty of tutorials or how-to videos around the web. Give it a try... it has potential.",1606340628,1700600965,True,0,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Then they got rid of the rather linear campaign, gave us a handful of missions, told us to make the rest, and did not even keep the perfectly good missions that were in the original.

Next the weapons dlc came.  Which was ok I guess, I personally did not care much, as this is supposed to be a game about search and rescue.  But at least I could finally defend myself against sharks with a spear gun.

Then came Industrial Frontier, which is mostly empty, but adds... I mean forces mining on you, if you want coal for steam engines and nuclear reactors.

Last came Space, and it was largely a waste of space on my hard drive (or would be if I bought it, which I did not).

The mechanics of this game are largely broken.  Engines are extremely under-powered and consume crazy amounts of fuel, which also produce crazy amounts of smoke as a result, and steam/nuclear is even worse.  To build things like sea planes requires extensive knowledge of game glitches.  The buoyancy is roughly half what it should be.  And you better know XML editing if you want your vehicles to look nice. And I have had to mod many of the parts to fix things like the engine power problem, excessive weight of blocks.

Then on top of it the devs LOVE to deprecate old, but perfectly fine parts for no good reason.  Want to build a tug boat, LOL you cant because the current winch ropes freak out if you put too much tension on them, the old ones worked fine in many ways but are hidden.

Custom engines can be hair pulling when they suddenly don't work, maybe because you forgot a part, or maybe because this time the script you use to run the engine suddenly decides it isn't going to work properly (I have literally wasted hours trying to bug fix engines, that I know works perfectly fine, and is hooked up correctly, but today just will not work, sometimes replacing the script block works).

Moving parts have a tendency to glitch, particularly when you are near them.  Like one time i was making a self loading train car using pistons and large rotors.  Sometimes the parts just refuse to work, loose all power, glitch out of themselves.  Suddenly the pistons of my rail car wont work. but if i run off 1 km or so they suddenly work again.

Then there are the tires.  We have begged the devs to fix the damn tires. They slide around like they are on grease if your vehicle weighs too much and have terrible traction. You can fix this problem by editing the traction of each wheel in your vehicle's XML file, but why is this nessiary

This could be a nice game, if the devs would have expanded on basic gameplay aspects, actually fixed things that have been broken for ever, fixed the huge problems with engines and mechanics of parts, and added certain parts (like 3 block wedges and undepricated certain parts). But sadly they do not listen much to us.

As a building game it isn't to bad.  Very irritating at times, but not too bad.  Unfortunatly the rest of the game is lacking any real gameplay.",1700570222,1700570222,False,73,3,0.793053507804870605,0,True,False,False

The developer keeps adding on half-baked content, putting more stress on the engine. Stormworks could be considered ""complete"" pre-1.0. Now it is a building sim, with nothing much to it, and that is excluding the bugs and issues associated with it. Any person who criticizes the game gets a 1984 from the developer (banned and whatever said deleted). Moreover, the developer is not aligned with the community, leading to more issues with bugs and content.

To be frank, I loved this game, although it has been on a downward spiral for quite some time; it is now the worse it has been. I bought this game pre-1.0 and loved it, if I bought it now, I would likely refund it.

If you like building: 7/10.
If you like anything else: 2/10.
And multiplayer varies time from time, so I cannot exactly give it a good rating. If you find a good server, in both performance and players; If it is either RP or weapons, you would be able to get good gameplay. Singleplayer is empty, outside of building and testing.

I say it is probably the best building game out there on Steam, and the developers clearly care about this masterpiece that they have created. Overall, I must give this game a big thumbs up.

Edit - As of May 22nd it is now 64 bit, improving performance a little bit.

Edit Nov. 2023 - 
The developers have lost it since the space DLC, with the amount of bans from the community hub due to bug reporting and releasing a half-baked DLC that broke the majority of workshop creations and my own creations.

There was a golden era for this game that has passed. The devs lost sight of what made this game special, and has robbed what was a beautiful game from its most invested player-base. 

This game asks you to spend hundreds of hours and hard work to master its complex building system. Twice now in one year, random minor updates have made the game completely unplayable for me, making me wait months for a fix. I now feel like the many hours I spent putting thought and care into my builds has been taken from me by these devs in pursuit of the next shiny content update. Many of the requests of the community have fallen on deaf ears. 

Once again all of the in-game monitors and displays are broken for me and hundreds of other players. I cannot restate this enough, a random update that did nothing to improve the quality of my game broke a major aspect of game-play and has still not been fixed. This was the second time a 'minor' update broke my game. The loss of money is nothing compared to your potential loss of time and effort.

Imagine your hobby was building models. Now imagine after the many tens of hours sanding, painting and gluing the model together, the manufacturer simply took that model away from you. That is what has happened to me and many others.

Edit:11/17/2023

I attempted to give this game another chance after keeping an eye on bug fixes for the past months. While my displays now function in game, most other aspects of every vehicle in my collection are broken by the new fluid system. My hopes were raised so high when I saw the functioning displays, but any system that requires fluids to function seem to be broken beyond simple repair. My submarine airlock now creates a vacuum, my reactors don't move steam into the pistons, and my fluid ballast systems are broken.",1689453385,1700293520,False,2,0,0.503525257110595703,1,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the devs want this game to be more than a Coast Guard / Rescue type game, and decided to release a half-assed DLC (Space, but only the moon, and it is just a larger skybox and low gravity) and rework the base game's physics. It has completely broken all of the workshop boats, which is what I bought the game for in the first place. A large amount of the big workshop creators have left the game, leaving all of the ships on the workshop broken. The devs now ban people from the Steam forums for talking about the update's issues, which is nothing new as they have mocked the community in the past over other bad updates. The devs also have no plans to optimize the game better, as it still uses OpenGL and only runs on 1 cpu core, which is horrible for a physics based game.

It takes WAY too long to make anything significant, on top of an immense learning curve. There's also a ton of crippling bugs / general bullshit you get to deal with- my least favorite issue has to be one introduced by the recent space DLC, where the game randomly gets stuck trying to save a vehicle which doesn't exist, and the only solution is to alt + F4.

The space DLC is somewhat interesting... but Geometa decided it'd be best to let the community figure out everything. The problem with that decision is that most of the community is busy being pissed at Geometa for breaking everything, and being very slow to fix what they broke. There's a ton of weird quirks to deal with if you wish to mess with the space DLC, and the people who are still playing are slowly figuring everything out. Don't get Stormworks if you're only interested in the space aspect, as its implementation is heavily limited (you can only go upwards into orbit around Earth... or go to the moon, and explore empty caves). I can only hope Geometa expands it in the near future (adding ice which can be drilled on the moon to permit sustained expeditions, more planets, etc.?), but I wouldn't place any bets on them doing so... Play something else if you're specifically interested in space stuff

I never understood why the industrial DLC is paid DLC, it seems to me like it should be base game content

Purchasing the weapons DLC is almost a requirement if you intend to get into Stormworks for some god forsaken reason, as it makes the game actually interesting and gives you something to build things for.

Performance can be pretty dogshit if you're messing with complex vehicles, and the peer-to-peer multiplayer experience is still plagued with performance problems and desync. I can't really say how the experience on dedicated servers compares to the peer-to-peer multiplayer experience, as I haven't played much on dedicated servers.

Stormworks scratches one of the most niche itches in existence (something along the lines of Space Engineers, Gmod w/ ACF, FTD, etc.), but it's held back by its core issues.",1638659603,1700277496,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

Update: The devs have been HARD at work to repair the game and while it is 98% back to stability there are still  a few issues with engine cooling. currently my only non-overheating creations make use of a jet turbine engine. while this isn't super upsetting it isn't exactly nice early game given the price of jet fuel.

Doing search and rescue missions with mates in some random helicopter is all sound, so long as the network code can handle the speed you are going and doesn't cause your friends to phase through matter to their deaths.

The developers know that maybe about 20% - 30% of the game works consistently:

""I know what they want to do; they want to drive trains and go to space!""

Maybe someday the developers will realize that the constant release of DLCs and hot fixes instead of hardcore bug fixes and quality of play will push away the fan base they already have and possibly scare away any future players.

It has turned into a buggy mess in the recent years but it still is worth playing if you're into  in-depth sandboxy games. To be honest it would be a mistake to call this a game since the game part of this game is very weak. Don't expect the ""Rescue"" part of ""Build & Rescue"". You will just be building most of the time. If you enjoy CAD programs like Fusion360 or FreeCAD, this is the game for you. You will be creating engines cylinder by cylinder, making cooling systems for them, programming micro-controllers and so on. It's a complex and fun game however it really, really is buggy.

Stomworks is an incredible game with a lot of potential. Emphasis on ""potential"".

I used to be on the side of people defending the game against the incredible criticism it would constantly get. However, it is clear to me that the devs have little interest in actually solving core problems or improving core features of the game, and instead prefer to spend time on DLCs to further earn revenue.

I don't think the Stormwork devs really understand the potential of their platform, and they subsequently didn't consider it in their business plan. 

The game has a lot of potential, but there are so many things holding it back that I have zero interest in playing it anymore. I had a lot of fun building things, but the user experience of trying to build complex creations without the use of mods is unbearable. So much time wasted and things breaking/being designed poorly because I have to work around problems that exist. It is not enjoyable.

Original Review: 

So far really enjoying the endless possibilities in this game. Have spent all my time in creative mode. Using logic and lua scripts to control things is really fun, let alone what you can do with displays using touchscreen or even more complex math for physics considerations. I haven't even started to mod the game yet or set up a dedicated server.

EDIT:
Today the new Space DLC has been released. It has broken a shit ton of things and game mechanics of the game and even added new artificial restrictions to the BASE GAME (=non-Space DLC).
Boats stopped floating, Planes stopped flying, Missiles don't work anymore, etc.
The Base Game got a new invisible wall to the Skybox, limiting max. Altitude to 20km. Before you could go far beyond 100km altitude (no limit). The fact that the Base Game got downgraded in functionality, just to push the DLC sale is a new low after massive amounts of bugs and broken mechanics sitting on their Bug-Reporter for Months and Years untouched, unanswered.

I purchased in when it first came out in early accesses where it was a buggy mess, I refunded it. I saw it had come out of early access so gave it another try. Not a single one of the bugs has been fixed. 

1) swimming is a nightmare, you cannot go underwater at all as you can only hold your breath for about 3-5 seconds but also just bounce straight to the surface
2) getting in and out of the water is also a nightmare where you just have to spam the jump key until you eventually get some air but then you have to pray to all that is holy you don't just bounce off and land back in the water
3) there is almost no tutorial, the game does not teach you anything about building a boat and instead lazily links you to a 3rd party youtuber who made, albeit very good videos, 3 years ago. and there is only five 10 minute vids which doesn't even scratch the surface of the monumental amount of options available
4) the game has a perma death feature I cannot for the life of me turn off, see above on the 5 seconds breath, better hope your boat doesn't glitch out and capsize leaving you stuck under there and dead or you just die and lose all your progress.
5) And this is what caused me to rage quit the game. I got a mission to put out a fire, fought for 5 minutes to put it out and eventually stood in the fire and sprayed it for 60 seconds while desperately healing myself and it still didn't go out. 

And the real kick in the gonads? I bought this game and then tried to refund it 40 minutes later but Steam has decided that because i played it for an hour three years ago i am not allowed a refund.

example of things that have broken every workshop creations:
Change of how nuclear reactors work, Change of how gearing works, Change of how cooling and engines work, Change of how batteries and pumps work.

>DLC promises, 14 dollars for a DLC that doesn't even work, when industrial DLC came out, gas stations didnt work, they added animals, most of the locations were totally bugged with their collision boxes, AND gas stations STILL dont work, Animals were also absolutely not needed

there is just SO much shady business going on with this company and im starting to think that most of these positive reviews are in some way collected, and not actual people leaving them.

You had such a great recipe for success. A relatively novel idea of a sandbox-y game with a focus on rescue elements and in-depth logic, opening doors to both simplified and very advanced contraptions.

Then came the weapons DLC, going a bit away from the main focus of the game but still remaining close to the topic with how coast guard forces are usually armed. Thanks to the available logic and tools, you also got to make more military-focused weapon systems for those who enjoy that kind of stuff (me included) while still remaining in a niche. Cannot think of a sandbox military game that is this in depth (and also user friendly, looking at you, From The Depths).

After that, we got industry DLC. New methods of making power and another relatively untapped niche with a lot of potential. More opportunities to make industrially-oriented contraptions with a purpose using the impeccable mechanics and systems available by default. Cannot think of a sandbox industrial game that is this in depth.

And now here we are, the space DLC, where everything falls apart. There are so many more sandbox games for space exploration and production, where their intended focus is entirely on space and planets, games built for that exact purpose. They don't have to break the physics to achieve their goals, because it's already how it works. They don't have to make an artificial space, because it's already how it works. KSP, Space Engineers, Elite Dangerous, Juno, you name it; the space DLC is merely a fraction of everything you can do in these games. I can't see this DLC as anything other than a quick money grab to finance other projects you are more interested into, instead of just improving what's already in the game and simply not adding more instability and glitches.",1697237320,1699714587,False,11,1,0.581762731075286865,0,True,False,False

TL;DR the Game Dev created his own nonsense physics system instead of basing the physics of the game on real world principles like aerodynamics which could have been done in a resource responsible way via a part-by-part basis.

Example:
Planes ingame dont have lift because of Speed+Wings they have lift because the engine is running.
So if you're in a plane and the engine stops, you fall straight down instead of gliding due to the fantasy physics this guy is using.

People have told him for years to fix this and he still hasn't.
Instead he makes DLCs that dont involve the physics system.
Space DLC, look up a youtube video and you will understand.

Also jet engines leave behind this massive trail effect as if they're water hoses in low atmosphere.

""Quality of life versus flashy features
kovarex
I know that you are mainly looking forward to the new content, and that just quality of life improvements aren't the kind of things that make people buy the game and get excited for.
But I strongly believe, that if you want to add content, mechanics, and systems to a game, which already isn't simple, there is always a risk of just it being too much. By doing QOL improvements, we reduce the small hassles and annoyances, which effectively creates an extra mental space to enjoy more in the game. Its like cleaning your room before getting a new toy.
So to make things clear, the reason that we make and present these kind of changes is not because we don't want to make new flashy features, we just want the new stuff to be enjoyable without a burden of having too much to deal with.
But don't worry, we will show something new next week!""


Stormworks is a game I have enjoyed for the amount of money I spent on it. But I cannot recommend buying it at the full price. Too much just doesn't work and the devs are solely to blame. I have enjoyed the time I put into it and will probably enjoy putting more time into it. If you like the tense waits as you move from one objective to the next that games like Carrier Command and Elite:Dangerous provide then I think there is something to be found here. But there is occasional jank that I do not believe the devs have any intention to fix. ""Oh well, send it."" seems to be their policy regarding most things.

every patch is broken in some way, wonky and partially broken physics, abusing exploits is pretty much mandatory to build functioning craft.

performance is generally pretty poor and when dealing with multiple or large vehicles the game barely functions even on very powerful hardware, if it's even playable at all.

there is a very limited amount of structural block available, leading to frustration when trying to build more complex shapes, because the elements needed for most transitions and slopes simply don't exist.

vehicle drag is fundamentally broken due to how badly blocks are implemented

instead of improving the game and fixing these issues, the devs are releasing paid DLC with content noone asked for (yes we totally needed buggy crocodiles made from what feels like 4 pixels that don't even spawn. seriously, where the fuck are they?) 

meanwhile the campaign is just boring and repetetive, it lacks variety in missions, the AI is infuriating to say the least. it feels like the campaign mode is just quickly implemented as an alpha, and has never been finished. 

instead we can go to space now (and do what there, exactly? whats the point?), yet there are no orbital mechanics, earth and the moon are flat, and space is just ""in between"", with gravity just somehow ending once you leave the atmosphere.

I think it's completely outrageous that the developers have released DLC for this game while the base campaign belongs to a game in very early access. 
I'm really disappointed by this game there's so much potential that's wasted by poor game design and bugs.

The idea is great, the graphics look surprisingly good, you can make just about anything provided you can figure out how to do it.  But that figuring out can be difficult, especially with the frequent major changes.    New components & systems get added with little or no official explanation or tutorial.  I've quit playing for months at a time, but also come back because I miss the good points of the game.  Damage to vehicles is totally senseless and has no fix in sight despite the pending release of a DLC adding weapons to the game.  For example - I can put a brush guard made from pipe segments in front of a vehicle and ram a building at 150+ kmh with no damage except to the brush guard, which did it's job & protected the hull.  But if I back up at 3 kmh & bump a wall, the rear half of the vehicle breaks & catches fire.

Update:  This game is the ultimate victim of ""feature creep.""  What started out as an interesting little rescue game that you had to build you own craft keeps getting more & more stuff.  But every time they add something new, all the old stuff breaks.  Sometimes it is an easy fix, sometimes not.  But as some of the great builders get bored or annoyed & move on, their wonderful creations become unworkable and/or get pulled from the workshop.  Easily half of my favorite workshop builds were victims of this.  Last I heard after the space DLC, everything broke.  Rather than even load the game & see if anything was still usable, I just uninstalled it from both of my computers.  It was fun while it lasted.",1594061853,1699645921,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

A year or two ago I would've recommended this game 100%, I wasn't particularly supportive of the first DLC being released even though the game still had some fairly major issues that needed fixing, but I could understand the devs needing some more cashflow with the team growing. I was planning on buying the 2 DLC for the game the next time I got into it, but then I heard about them making a space DLC. A SPACE DLC! For a game about running a coastguard, how does that make any sense? I haven't purchased the DLC (and never will purchase any DLC for this game now, nor recommend anybody buy it) but from what I've heard the space is just go up, and eventually reach the moon. I simply cannot support the developers of this game after that move, they've released a DLC that nobody asked for and because of the development of this DLC, they say they were forced to release the fluid system rework early, which was not thoroughly tested, and broke many creations. And now, the most recent announcement of the devs is them basically crying to the community begging for pity, saying they were too stressed to focus on fixing the issues, and the amount of negative reviews aren't helping.",1699510875,1699510929,False,18,0,0.602335751056671143,0,True,False,False

On my old account (which was unfortunately hacked into) I had a total of over 2,000. Having played over 2,628 hours from 2018 to 2023 Stormworks has come a long way since its infancy. I've had some great moments playing with friends on this game but all the bugs and multiplayer connection problems start taking their toll. 

The developers don't seem to listen to the players as much as they used to. For instance, people have been asking for a major fix on the bugs in both SP and MP for a couple of years now. Instead of fixing those bugs, the developers continued adding more updates that added more features and admittedly cool things. Yet, it's hard to enjoy those things when the coding reinforcing them hasn't been given proper attention and care. 

The foundation (Premise) of this game is amazing and I've yet to see any other game accomplish the kind of gameplay Stormworks has. However, the infrastructure (Coding, TLC, etc), is severely lacking. For example, several major things needed to be fixed such as decent MP servers. They didn't fix the core problem behind the MP servers. Those problems are people not in sync properly, and seat issues. 

e.g. the server host can sit in a seat connected by a hardpoint and have no problems with 1st or 3rd person. However, the server-client would only be able to see from 3rd person but couldn't see past the seat cushion in 1st person. Something my friends and I noticed when flying airplanes. 

Also If you have more than three to five people, the server delay when spawning a vehicle is ridiculous, even when it's a very small vehicle. I'm sure there are more things I missed when playing MP but I'll leave you to read other reviews and comments that go plenty in depth on the topic.

This game used to be 15$ originally upping to 25$ not too long ago. For its current state, IMO it's only worth 15$. Kind of like a person who enjoyed a film when they were younger growing up to see the film is not as great as they originally thought, they still appreciate it for the entertainment and nostalgia it gave them. Stormworks is like that film to me. Despite the game's problems, it would be dishonest of me to say that I didn't enjoy the time I had with it in its infancy days and partially current days. I will probably still play it now and then with friends just not as frequently.

For anyone considering buying this game, I'd suggest buying it when it's on sale and not at full price. There are still fun things to do in this game but remember, there are some serious flaws you'll meet throughout your gameplay.",1688243344,1699470095,False,18,2,0.618489861488342285,0,True,False,False

To start, here is a list of 14 memorable things they did in the past few years:
- They published the weapons DLC, absolute clusterfuck
- They added space. If you're a three-body-problem enthusiast, this is the game for you. If you actually wanted space, lmao.
 - They added HTTP but they immediately rolled back the update after they figured out why we hire Security Analysts in web developement.
- Modular engines were incredibly hard to cool for the longest of time (when the playerbase complained, they replied with skill issue)
- Nuclear power, more like cancer for everyone for free
- AI: it didn't work. You could make the helicopters stack up onto the spawn island by dozens.
- Oil. It spills everywhere. Everytime. And you have to use a 3rd party addon to fix it.
- Natural disasters. My ears still hurt from the sirens.
- The steam locomotive piston reversers are just a boolean. who the fuck does that?
- 1x3 wedges. Its been 7 years goddamn it.
- RADARs, whenever they update them, everything explodes
- gearboxes had torque limits that were lower than the output of a xenon rocket engine
- electrical chargers output the same amount of power as your phone
- multiplayer. it never worked, never will.

Then they come to guilt trip us and tell us it is our fault. nuh uh

but V 1.0 performance continues to go down.

DLC is doesn't  make performance  better.

multiplayer over long distances{USA to UK)  are hard or impossible to stay connected.

Why does it say server FPS?not TPS

why is there file limited size 25 MB
ANYTHING OVER 25 MB be delete

mod the workbench to 1000x1000x1000 is good but you only place 511 block in either direction?

THE GAME ONLY USES 2 CORE 1 HANDLES PHYSICS AND OTHER ONE DOES LOGIC.
BUT GPU AND CPU NEED TO BE IN SYNC. EXAMPLE: TOO MUCH LOGIC AFFECT PHYSICS OR 20 FPS AFFECT PHYSICS  

There is a constant rolling resistance with train wheels?

Anything over mach 1 uncontrollable?

I have quit this Stormworks: Build and Rescue. All of my vehicles are on the workshop for people to use or complete. Reason why I have quit Are there personal things that need to be done. Indeed developers Are causing more damage to the game than actually progressing and not improving the quality.
Like: The game doesn't teach them how to build in the editor( Workbadge) or Annoying warnings for good creations.
And on the workshop side of things, there's a lot of things that are out of date due to the changes the developers have made. Hard to enjoy the game.",1599681344,1699221486,False,0,0,0,11,True,False,False

On the 12th of October, 2023, the community of [i] Stormworks: Build and Rescue [/i] was hit with the absolute disaster that is the release of the [i] Stormworks: Space [/i] DLC and it's updates.

The DLC and it's updates have caused a large amount of game breaking bugs to appear, and said bugs have broken around half of every [i] Stormworks [/i] creators vehicles. Considering how obvious these bugs are in game, the developers must have competely ignored doing any playtesting before launching the update and DLC whatsoever.

I hope that the future of this to me and many others beloved game is far brighter than that of it's current state. The responsibility lays on the shoulders of the [i] Stormworks [/i] dev team to ensure that this dream of a brighter future is achieved, and i can only hope that the community's outcries are heard by them.

(Edit: It appears that the dev team have immediately launched a campaign to fix the bugs that accompanied the new DLC. I have a feeling that the community's reaction was a bit too harsh (considering that some have resulted to death threats), and i myself feel obligated to apologize to the devs for the possibly aggressive tone of this review and for what some of the community have done. I can definitely understand that it is quite a burden to have to deal with the entire community's outrage.

Many thanks to the dev teams efforts, and hope for the future of this game.)

Ok enough talking about random things now let me get to the point.

The good things about this games are the fact that it is quite realistic and is very detailed. The bad things about this game is the fact that there is a lot of PAID DLC's and why would you pay around £8 after paying around £20. Money does not grow on trees. 

Conclusion of all the above nonsense:
I like the game quite a bit but also don't like it for various reasons. Also If you've actually spent your time reading this rubbish. Thanks.

Bought the oil rig base and the industrial DLC figured i would start drilling all over and see how far i could go with it. I did alot of research on how to set up all the systems for drilling and still couldn't get it to work. I even went on the workshop to test some other builds and see if i was just ""missing"" something simple and still the same result. So i figured i would dig deeper and search the discussions just to find out drilling for the most part is screwed due to the new DLC. 

People looking to buy, WAIT! Yeah you will have fun with the basics and learning how to build, but it seems like the more advances things are just plain broke. Took me 40hrs ( which isn't much considering builds ) to realize i should have just refunded when i could have due to how broke almost every system in this game is.

Also forgot to add, my rig isnt the most powerful, but i have a decent overclocked CPU ( i7-8700k  pushed to 4.5ghz ) and i still have issues with the damn physics slowing to a crawl. I would say i have a LOVE/HATE relationship with this game. When building something new, i love it until i go to test and find another system broken, just gets frustrating after a while when the whole point of gaming for me is to relax. 

Once things are fixed, if they ever are, i will update this review.

**UPDATE 11/4**
So i decided to play something else until some patches came out and have been meaning to update this but life has had me busy with other things. 
The last patch i played was 1.9.10 and it seemed like things are starting to be resolved and working the way they were before the space DLC. Not saying its all fixed as i came into this game at a ""broken"" period and dont know if a system is broke, or is just me. 
I do give the devs a big kudos on trudging through the toxic threats and trolling as not many devs do anymore.. To me that shows they truly do care about this game and are upset themselves at how things went. I get as gamers, we get upset, but that doesn't give ANYONE a reason to act like some have and is totally unacceptable. 

 As soon as this review update hits, ill be launching the latest patch ( 1.9.16 ) to mess around some more.",1698164835,1699158146,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Left bugs related to buoyancy persist for over a year. The mission editor was removed and replaced with an undocumented LUA solution. Developers also removed LUA code which we used to make weapons in-favour of releasing their own weapon DLC. I'm so very disappointed.

Edit: I came back, got another hundred hours or so logged in 2023. Still can't recommend the game, career mode still feels like an empty shell, performance is terrible (i7 10th gen, 32gb ram, 3080ti) if you have too much stuff in. How much stuff is too much stuff? I had lag because I spawned a crane and several shipping containers to load onto my ship.

Buoyancy was never fixed, multiplayer is still desync central.

Honestly, if the devs had concentrated on the core gameplay of Search and Rescue, it would probably be a much better game. Instead they have to keep churning out DLC's that the community asks for so they can get more cash. Weapons was just dumb in a S&R game, but now we've got space.

I'm a **very** casual player due to the complexity and constant changing of systems that require you to re-learn concepts or simply just break them each time to the point where its not even worth it to bother trying. I enjoyed the time I've spent playing but the lack of any concrete guides or assistance into the complex system while the devs hold the ""It's not our responsibility"" or ""Leave it to the community"" attitude is honestly just stupid. Looking at another indie game ""Stationeers"" has full in depth guides into each object and resource in the game itself is better.

One of those games that ""has potential"" but has never been fully realised and has instead turned into some kind of cash cow with dlcs that don't really relate to the base game (for the record, weapons dlc is what brought me to the game), that break existing mechanics and add more bugs, each time.
Multiplayer is nigh unplayable and although this game has a unique take on vehicle construction, and I while I wish I could say it's worth the effort playing - the world is quite dead, and quite broken. The devs seem to think because they have recieved abuse (discord kids sending death threats) that invalidates all the (fair) backlash and outrage of a continually broken game. If you do just like to experiment with building things and making things work, you probably will have a few dozen hours of fun in this game. But once you realise that the game isn't going to actually get that much better, or polished, the optimism dries up. The kind of stuff you can build is cool, but ultimately you can't do a whole lot with it, or it quickly becomes tedious or boring. That or you get lagged the fuck out and put into slow mode because the game is loading more than 1 vehicle. Lol. Lmao.",1699101698,1699101698,False,1,0,0.504103958606719971,0,True,False,False

Prior to this i would have absolutely recommended this game if you enjoy engineering challenges without too many real world physics problems.

Why I am not recommending this game now? First, the update/dlc were not tested at all, and many mechanics of the game were broken. Of course the community pointed this out and asked to revert the game versions and upload the update again after proper testing. But this didn't happen. We get every week a little fix which are not solving the current main problems, rather some changes on particle effects. -WOW- this helps a lot when the whole ship is not moving, because all steam engine / reactor related parts are not working properly.

People are so emotional about this game at the moment because the love(d) it. They spent 100s of hours in creating beatiful creations, creative Ideas and mechanics, but a lot of it does not work anymore, or is very bugged. The developers seem to have a bad leadership which is blocking a constructive communication with the community. They read the comments and refer to it during when they post news, but the actual results in game improvement is not seen yet. Maybe it takes, as the the critical dlc/update were released 3 weeks ago.

If you are intrested in this game, check youtube videos and the community section to see if the mayor issues were fixed at the point you consider buying.


Update 04.11.2023: I will change from not recommended to recommended, as in the last days the developers provided many hotfixes and patches, improving the game. We are still not at the point where everything works as prior to the dlc/update, but I see where we are heading.",1698745114,1699096803,True,10,0,0.599535524845123291,0,True,False,False

It is tedious, buggy, unfocused, shallow, multiplayer does not function, and there is a high chance that anything you make will suddenly stop working.

For a while, the game has been the definition of a wide but shallow ocean - there's ostensibly a lot of depth in building vehicles, but absolutely none in using them, because the play area is gigantic with very little to do in it. 
As an example, your average rescue mission is about 30min to an hour of travelling, where you then put some people on your boat and maybe hold m1 to put out a fire, and then spend another 30min to an hour of travelling. There is nothing to do during that time, the only thing you will see during it is ocean, and the only thing you will hear is your engine.
This is because every aspect of the game is frontloaded into vehicle creation. That is the only place where there is anything to [i]do[/i]. Which means you can spend a lot of time making things, but there is no incentive to use them.

The DLCs are supposed to have fixed this, but by every account they've just added more big areas with nothing to do, added broken systems that don't actually work as advertised, broken existing systems, and completely neglected to improve upon existing areas of the game. 
They've also each taken big strides away from the core concepts of the game, muddying the focus entirely by adding war, mining, and space flight to what was ostensibly a rescue game. Again, doing all of these things very poorly in the process.

The latest DLC at time of posting is space, which follows the exact same pattern. As far as I'm aware, on top of there being absolutely no reason to go to space besides novelty, there are not even orbital mechanics. I don't intend to find out for myself. 
The update that came with it broke the vast majority of existing ships to the point they immediately sink, introduced a number of crippling bugs to various engine types that means existing ships no longer function, and generally made sure that whatever you've been working on will need major changes.

[b]The devs' response to backlash has been to say that they are ignoring it and hope the problems go away.[/b]

The only way things will change is if they seriously re-evaluate the way they're developing the game and start working to improve and expand upon the core gameplay outside of the creator - travel, the depth of activities, and the ways you interact with a ship - to communicate much more openly and clearly with the community, and to change whatever process they're using to test new builds because it is absolutely not functional. 
Any further DLCs will continue to have the exact same problems and response otherwise.",1699096695,1699096695,False,2,0,0.505760729312896729,0,True,False,False

On the surface, it's a fantastic game. Infinite possibilities, countless objectives, limitless customization. From the vehicle builder, to the unlock system, to the world itself. On the surface, all are great. However, looking into it, you begin to see cracks. Nothing, i repeat, NOTHING is explained to you. If you want to figure out how to build a ship, you have to learn it all by yourself. From the mass, center of gravity, buoyancy, weight, the logic!?. On the store page you see all these huge ships with detailed interiors, screens for information, gauges galore. What you don't see is the hundreds of hours it took to create each and every one of those. This game is a huge time sink, just in the creation of ships and vehicles, completely ignoring the actual gameplay. I spent 5 whole weeks, 3-4 hours a day just working on a controller for a 3x3 touchscreen for a ship. you want to know how many controllers most of the large ships have? 20-50. TWENTY TO FIFTY. IT TOOK ME 5 WEEKS FOR ONE. And sure, you can download a few premade, but a vast majority have to be customized you your boat specifically. I am quite literally maybe 10% done with the ship the touchscreen was made for. Not to mention that the controllers, realistically, need you to have lua experience to use effectively, which I do, thank god. All of that learning applis to everything, each time you want to use a new system. Steam engine, modular engines, pump systems, electrical, fuel systems, emergency systems, sensors, radar, gps, maps, autopiliot, ALL OF IT, needs to be built from the ground up, inside your ship/vehicle. Its a fun system for sure, but the amount of time needed to get all of it working for a large, more or less mid game ship is staggering. Now onto some other gripes. the physics are, well, wonky at times. clipping parts make you ship freak out, like sommersalt over and over freak out, regardless of ship size. The sell points are horribly placed across the map, and fuel is limited unless you get into oil rigging, which is yet another system you have to completely learn and build all by yourself. The devs, good at heart, but a bit in over their heads. I mean cmon, space dlc in a coast gaurd game. It's an awesome idea on paper, but it does not, at all, fit the game. And it broke most creations, so boats dont float, planes dont fly, and helicopters dont hover (remember that most of these took over 100 hours to finish). It's completely understandable why there is so much backlash, and I agree on most things. However I do plan to come back when things are repaired. Lastly, I am absolutely sickened by how many people have straight up doxxed the devs on twitter and discord. That is disgusting and I do hope the devs get the legal system involved to show them that that is very much not ok. Not to anyone, but especially to a game studio that at the end of the day, is just trying to make a fun game. It wouldn't benefit them at all to keep it worse, so why are people so up in arms about it. Example, Elden ring right, for one update they straight corked a certain item that was huge for magic users. The community noticed, reported it, and it got fixed, and nothing else happened. Is that so hard for this community to do? Rant over. 4/10 buy the game on sale if you can, but if not its still worth the full price.",1699083667,1699083667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Stormworks is a delightful take on creative engineering, and an excellent game for those who treasure memories of opening a LEGO chest and thinking ""what will I build today?"".

Beyond simply physically simulating creations, it features powerful logic features from pre-configured components to visual programming tools and LUA scripting support to unlock virtually limitless possibilities to what you can build.

Apart from that, the career mode is a very interesting take on the sandbox building genre, providing an interesting motivation to progress and mission types that incentive creative thinking about what to build next.

I fondly remember the moment where I had to salvage a sunken ship and had to choose between building a bigger boat that could simply grapple and tow it, a ballast flotation system I could attach to it by diving to it from my starter rescue boat, or go ahead and design a submarine to do the job.

Dozens of hours later I went on to design a VTOL aircraft capable of landing on water - and felt wonderful about tweaking it and watch it perform better and better as my understanding about it grew!

The game was pretty cool until they shifted their focus further and further away from SAR/EMS/Fire related content. The weapons update/DLC was fine, I guess, given the dual homeland security/rescue duties of many coast guard agencies, but I personally didn't buy the DLC. The Industrial update was so annoying cause now I gotta deal with running out of fuel on base. I didn't buy that DLC either cause I really didn't see the value to a search and rescue game. The Space DLC/update was not a good idea. Most creations no longer work (many of the things that were broken upon DLC release are fixed, but not everything is), it has nothing to do with rescuing anything, and it's another incredibly tone-deaf move by the devs. The game has RESCUE in the name and at this point is about basically everything except rescue. Don't waste your money on this game.

There's plenty of games where you can build your military vehicles and fight, and there's also plenty of space sims and industry sims. However, this is the only game of it's kind that really has any focus on SAR or coast guard operations. It's just a shame the devs have decided to shift focus away from what makes their great and unique.",1697334180,1699062412,False,3,0,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False

The problem is, that the changes, that were needed for the DLC, were introduced as an update to the core game. With said update there were so many bugs, that many things don't work as they did before the update, some work worse and others don't work at all. 

On top we are now roughly three weeks in the new update and there have been several ""fixes"", that fixed specific issues, but broke/changed other so that now with every fix something works differently than before or not at all.

I personally hope the devs will fix the game to a playable state comparable to before the space DLC, but my hope is fading from day to day, because a fix seems to fix two things, but creates two or more new issues on the other end. And that the devs have now stated that they didn't have methodical testing in place until after the recent update, while the game is now 5 years old from early access on, is not a good sign either.

When it's great, it's great. You can build all manner of creations, pretty much anything you can dream of. But the game is ruined by terrible, inconsistent physics, poor multiplayer code, and updates that break things.

For example: boats often don't float properly, because water is insufficiently dense. Also, unsealed boat volumes don't generate and floatation, even if they would in real life. 
The multiplayer in this game is great - again, when it works. The game uses a 'desync' system to deal with variable frame rates etc. This is great, until me and my friends ended up over a minute apart in sync, and the game became unplayable. This is all despite us both having excellent and tested internet connections.

Another issue is game-breaking updates. The latest update has completely broken most of my creations that use the modular engines - they now all produce about 1/8 as much power as they did before, for no reason. And it hasn't been fixed yet.

The devs need to stop making this game complicated, and start f**king fixing it.

With the Space DLC (which i do not own) came gigantic bugs, like buoyancy just straight up not working. Before the update, vehicles sensibly spawned filled with air. This makes sense, because we aren't manufacturing vehicles in space. Now, we apparently are, and vehicles spawn filled with void. This means opening a door causes air to rush in and even just placing 2 doors in a sort of 'hallway' with 1 block in the middle means you have created a black hole. And this isn't a black hole that makes sense, because it pushes you away... somehow? Turret rings, when one side is sealed off, create a vacuum cleaner strong enough to suck in props. (not propellers, props) Meanwhile, Geometa is slowly hotfixing their way through this mess, when it could have been avoided entirely by actual quality assurance. Some might say you can't expect QA to find everything, but I would fucking expect QA to find that buoyancy doesn't fucking exist anymore. Or that black holes now exist. I would recommend not buying this game for at least a few weeks until Geometa (maybe) gets back on course. Apart from Geometa being like this for years with bugs (never this bad, I think, but large steam train wheels don't work and they were added a year ago) Stormworks is a good game.

The main issue with this game is that the devs seem to be focused exclusively on new features that they find interesting (witch are in many casses pointless additions). Case and point: the entire space dlc. Are we suposed to rescue jebediah? 
This would not be that bad if they did not break the base game more and more with every update. Every hot ""fix"" makes the game buggier and buggier. The joints spaz about, systems are extreamly confusing, things break all of the time. It took me an embarrassing amount of time to set up a proper cooling system for an engine and i am not some clueless kid. Not to mention that the PID controller is useless (esspetially compared to From the depths), you are better off making a linear feedback loop.
An aesthetic gripe i have with the game are the build limits. the weird box proportions lead to ships that look awful. I am aware of file editing bullshit but you shouldn't have to do that to make a ship in a ship making game!

As the years went the game became more of a creative builder and it started moved away from the previous search and rescue deal.
	
	Guns got introduced as DLC, which flopped in my opinion, due to difficulty of aimbot level combatants which you have to out range or etc... along with the fact the domination game mode... wasn't all that exciting especially since you had to go between vehicle types to do it effectively  (which means you needed like 3 or more vehicles) so you have to rely on workshop vehicles... Fun for a handfull of hours but it wasn't what i was told it was going to be... 

	Industrial Frontier came out after, it was pretty fun, won't lie still not the game but in a way it kinda expanded on the game premise. extracting, refining and so on was fun... made an oil derrick which was a very complex system to do... not to mention refining it.

	Space (last released DLC as of writting) broke the game and so many creations. The game we are were building creations for... a major got ruined and as of writing despite many patches my creations won't work unless i make a boat operate like a spaceship even though i did not get the space DLC and is part of the ""Free"" update. $10 cash grab... i won't harp on since everyone collectively can speak about the horrors it had created

	The Devs, I have no information on this so i'll gloss over from what i have heard and seen through my lens of talking and sharing through reddit... They are a problem. Which i hate to say because devs trying their best shouldn't get any amount of flak. I don't believe they are sadly enough or very least... don't give a dam about the original ideology of stormworks. Not to mention rumors of individuals getting banned off their discord for the smallest disagreement through out many years and only reason why i use rumors is because i have no proof but i'm sure someone can find a mountain's worth.

	Odds and Ends: through out the years stormworks, actually eroded away from a sea and air search and rescue, breaking that loop which got boring because it wasn't being worked on and instead we are now playing a different game under the guise of ""Stormworks"". Mutiplayer was another reason, however the code got worst instead of better over the years in my opinion with some patches feeling good in between but as soon as they add something new it's gone... I believe in one of their update notes said the game's code was all over the place which no doubt is working against them.

	Right now: i'm not playing it due to all the things they need to patch up on stormworks, i got my money's worth in earlier play but that game is gone. I had fun, i'm waiting for someone to dethrone this game in both categories that kinda had me going... Search and Rescue... and as a versitle builder where anything can happen. For the sake of record keeping and a good way to display my issue... this is the description they still use, despite it not ringing all that true anymoreon their page (10/30/23):
	""Join a world where you design, create and pilot your own air sea rescue service. Release your inner hero as you battle fierce storms out at sea to rescue those in need.""",1698645012,1698645012,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I however do not believe that this game is fully finished. The multiplayer feels super unpolished and the few things that do work in multiplayer are super slow and super laggy. In single player you can get quite far however you will hit the lag of death mission which will render your career save impossible to use. Great concept, okay execution. Once the devs fix the multiplayer I believe that this game will be great.

Revision 7-29-2023:
Has the multiplayer gotten any better? Still No.
Is the career mode fun? Nope, this modes whole style is on saving people all by yourself which is fine but hiring people would make this go from a 3/10 to a 7/10.
Does the game have a proper tutorial? Nope
Should I buy this game? Get it when its on sale.

Revision 10-30-23:
Has the multiplayer gotten any better? Yes, game lag has gone down.
Is the career mode fun? No adjustments made. (Space DLC kinda crapped on this)
Does this game have a proper tutorial? No.
Does the Space DLC have a proper launch platform for the rockets? No, somehow this DLC didn't add any workshops that include any launchpads! How do you even have a space game without launch pads! Even a large hanger would be acceptable. I'm starting to get to a point where I'm done with this games devs giving me hopes for something cool but not consulting the community at all.

It's now turned into a mess of scope creep and frankly bipolar design considerations. In the latest DLC they implemented what looks to be a simple space model with no directions, or very misleading, on how it all works. Yet at the same time implement a complicated and untested fluid and gas mechanic that ""breaks everything"". Space is a cash grab for the ""Camodo kiddies"" that probably have little clue or experience on how to work with the second.... ""yeah! Pew-pew in Space... someone build something!!! Why is my boat not flying? I put a rocket on it"". Perhaps a simplified statement but you get the point. Space appears to be a simplified 3 zone gravity implementation with no considerations for what is actually involved in space travel.

At this point I very much regret re-upping and getting the Space DLC to see if I can figure it out. Space as a DLC should never have happened because clearly the game engine can not properly support it. I gave it my all and ran tons of experiments and came to the following conclusion... it's absolute garbage with nothing to do once you arrive at your destination. It doesn't forward any of the previous game mechanics and absolutely breaks all considerations of the past... even if you didn't opt in for the new DLC.

I've been playing this game since 2020. And due to me kind of not building things that are super complex, and I haven't bought any of the DLCs. I *hadn't* noticed that many of the things that have been broken in earlier updates.

I say ''hadn't,'' because since abit after its release, and especially now: the game has just become a gash grab.

I payed a big sum of money for this game. (I think like 30 euros.) And when I first got it, sure, it was hard to understand all the mechanics. And I did have a period where I quit the game. But atleast there were a bunch of tutorials to help me.

However, nowadays each update and even DLCs are half-baked. And all of the tutorials that I find for newer things become outdated as the devs quickly do some changes. Not due to the fact that they want people to enjoy their game, but mostly because the community gets angry at the bad updates.

At first, I didn't really understand why the community got so angry, but now I can understand why.

Stuff like the steam piston update. Where I was super excited to finally make fancy (somewhat) realistic trains. Then I spent over a day making my biggest train yet. Only for it to fail to choo-choo out of the junction outside the train spawn I was using. About a week later it still didn't work, even if I had done dramatic changes to it.

Only several months later when I checked on the state of steam pistons was it working.

Now, it isn't just the side-show things that are broken upon release and way further into the game; but also the main parts of the game.

The main idea of certain DLCs already existed way back, when I didn't even know of the game, and way before the first DLC. Like animals, which were already in the vanilla game before the 2020s.

And this new space update really screwed things up, since the devs didn't really seem to separate space from everything that is not space. (Like earth.)

So you can fly with fire extinguishers and every time that you open a door it uses the same visual effect as when water is leaking in through it.

And about that ''main game/core game'' being ruined. In this case it's the ships.

You know, the things with whirly whirlies in some shape (archimedes screws, propellers, waterwheels, etc) that go across the water. The thing that cover a very, very big part of the map.

Well now the barely float. And even after their community-demanded fixes. Quite alot of the still don't work right.

Stuff like boats filling up with water when the hit the water. Or boats just magically losing several tons of weight and bobbing up and down. This is alongside the already exaggerated, slow gravity. Which causes things such as cars not touching the ground with their front wheels at somewhat small frontal winds.

I even have some experience with this. Since I'm making a U-boat. And a couple months ago I did a big interior redesign. The past interior made it very top-heavy. Yet it floated just fine. But now, with a (I think, I don't have very good memory) less top-heavy design, it just rolls over onto its side like a sleeping dog.

The whole ''more bite than you can chew'' thing that I said in the beginning is shown over the years.

Stormworks already had some problems from unfinished updates. Yet they were somewhat managable.

Now, they added a whole fucking vacuum surrounding the map, with a massive natural satellite.

Yet they just made it look well done, never actually doing anything to the map, where the average stormworker will be if they don't buy the DLC.

So the state of the map and game for non-DLC playing and even DLC-playing players is ruined because they tried to take a big bite with a small mouth.

Even with this whole text I still have one more thing to add. This game isn't really about making your own fancy creations that can do cool stuff. It's about making pre-designed systems to attempt to make something that'll work.

The game never allows you to fully go outside the box with your ideas. The building grid doesn't even have to be a necessary thing that you can only remove by tampering with the files. It's only there so that each of you creations doesn't perhaps, maybe partially disappear when you spawn it if it's too big and overcomplicated.

Yet people have made full-scale replicas of the Antonov-225, massive hindenburg-like airships and flying aircraft carriers without any problems. Because they kept them within the limits of the game engine.

If the game perhaps had a tutorial, abit more physics than just for premade parts, or allowed players to have the build grid be recommended to them, but still have it be optional, then I feel that the game would be more attractive to people who truly want to build. Instead of downloading things off the workshop and doing whatever with them.

Though I can't blame them, if a game changes drastically in some way, then the community will too. This went from a search and rescue game with building aspects. To a broken exploration, fighting, horror (krakens, megalodons, zombies) game with a small amount of the community building stuff to provide the rest of the community with stuff to do so.

There might be alot of things that this text is missing. And if so I apologize, since just like this games newer updates, this text is half-baked and not checked for mistakes.

Also, this game wasn't even designed to succeed, it's just a cash cow for the devs now so that they can fund their other projects.

I hope that anyone who actually wants to gives me criticism, feedback or something to add, since I this text doesn't have that much evidence behind it.

This is one of those reviews, that is cognitive of personal bias; but chooses to be fair and accurate.

EDIT: 10/17/2023: Following the ""Release"" of the Space DLC (which I didn't even purchase knowing it would be a disaster), they have migrated all the game breaking changes to the main game, if you thought it was the Space DLC that broke your game, think again, the workshop is now full of vessels and equipment that will never work again. Every old Submarine, Jet, and Train no longer works. Not Buying the Space DLC by some miracle doesn't ""opt out"" of the new 500m/s Speed Limit OR the new ""2500 FT Alt Flame-out"".

The Game itself:

A fun, very authentic, very realistic vehicle simulator. Which despite it's lack of vanilla content has been a source of hours of enjoyment for me.

The Developers and Moderaters:

These people destroyed the game for me. Not because of Fancy DLCs that cost too much, or because of lack of effort, but because of supporting people who personally attacked me. It is one thing to moderate a game forum and issue bans for that forum. It is a completely different thing to take bans from the forum and apply them to the game. I know I'm a hair trigger when it comes to my emotions; my permanent ban from the forums was most likely nothing wrong; what MY issue is, is they take that freedom of speech offense, and use it to encroach on my ability to post content for their game OFF the forums. I really don't care what the existing community in part thinks, but I know this: The moment you cater to the idea that gameplay and feedback are inseparable, you start to lose your sense of morality as a developer. My addons, have since had to be uploaded by a third party (JerryFanFan - who generously agreed to post some of my more popular mods in spite of the ban). It was never about credit for me; only about serving the community that I catered to; but these events have left me in such a state that I can no longer upload ANY creations to the workshop for Stormworks; far from being fair or just, this is discrimination.",1553159789,1698456615,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Surely our technology has no limits, but a simple built-in automatic transmission? Do not speak of such myths. They don't exist and can NEVER exist because REASONS! ""But every other vehicle building game on the planet has-"" SILENCE! Thou shalt not speak of automatic transmissions! THEY. DO. NOT. EXIST!

I want to love Stormworks so badly, but it's just ridiculous that the game has come so far, yet it's lacking in one of the most basic things... ever. A simple, built in automatic gearbox item. The whole community seems to laugh at this idea and that baffles me to no end. ""Build your own and solve the problem!"" they say... Do hot rod builders go and mine the iron ore and silicon and smith the gears and computer systems themselves and build a gearbox? No! They buy a gearbox. There are whole engines in this game, but no whole auto gearbox? This makes zero sense. As for making my own...

Go and look up the (Very VERY few) tutorials for building your own automatic transmissions. Have you seen the controller data you have to mess with? It's massive, crazy and super complicated. I'd need fifty college degrees to understand that crap. All for what every other game has BUILT IN! 

So for a normal person, building one isn't an option. Your next thought would be ""Go to the workshop then, smart guy! There are tons there!"" There are either giant examples that won't fit in normal cars, whole cars that kill the point of building my own vehicle, or controllers that do nothing on their own. Without knowing how these things work, I can't do anything with the last two options. There's just nothing that can be done here. Manual controls are just awful. You have to max rev your engine 100% of the time, (Heating it up way too much) and only control the clutch to move. It's not realistic to how vehicles actually drive.

To Sunfire/Geometa, the devs of Stormworks, I beg you to please just give us a simple automatic gearbox part with changeable ratios like a racing sim's tuning. The masochists and rocket scientists can still build their own and brag like naked fists only Soulsborne players, but normal people could finally play the game. Iv'e had this game for years and haven't been able to enjoy it because of this one stupid thing. It has been super frustrating seeing so much great content being added to the game that I'm basically not allowed to play. Space is just the pinnacle of comedy here. ""We can go to space, but we can't have automatic transmissions for our cars on earth."" Talk about running before you learn to crawl.

Come on devs... Help us out... Even if it's paid DLC. I will buy it in a heartbeat and sing your praises as a savior. The cult of Geometa.",1578381870,1698406288,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While there have been a great number of excellent updates, it feels like no effort has been put towards making the game playable with larger vehicles. Both my CPU and GPU are very high powered, yet this game runs awfully with anything larger than a boeing 777. I am very disappointed with the developers and how they only focus on adding new content (in the form of DLCs because ofc.). I don't mind the new content being DLCs, as I know they need to make money somehow. But I can't recommend this game when the devs keep disregarding a fundamental part of every game (multi-threading) in favor of adding more stuff that only makes the game perform even worse. 

Old review:

I have been playing this for a good amount of time. Great game! There are major downsides involving performance (cpu wise). You need a great cpu., This game does not support multi-threading, so you experience major physics slow downs (literal slow motion) with large vehicles. Other than that, one of my favorite games!

I came back to the game as the last time I played this was when I believe the game was in early access so I was coming back with almost no memory of how the game functioned. I tried to build a simple boat, now I played and love From the Depths so complex building mechanics are not unfamiliar to me but at least From the Depths has in game tutorials on how the blocks function and how they are supposed to be placed. It took me about 4-6 HOURS to make a simple starter raft and only a couple videos and even then it runs like crap because it feels like the water is made from molasses and any attempt to run an engine on a 3:2 power results in it stalling more than a zoomer in a manual car. After a lot of other frustrating things that are not explained like trying to build a simple truck for another 4-5 hours. Like it's 4 wheels and an engine, so many things went wrong because I had no idea how to properly throw things together BECAUSE THERE IS NO TUTORIAL, and yes, I looked, it's only some crappy youtube tutorials that you need to go to the devs youtube page to view, nothing in game. Later tried to make a helicopter because I wanted an easy way to get around and transport people. Took me an ENTIRE DAY just to get a chopper that could fly me around because once again explanation on blocks and building needs are either community made which they commonly miss out on important details like the heli gyro needs to be placed facing upward, or the tail rotor needs to be on the left side of the craft are commonly missed as well and no explanation of the effect of the rotor blade selection and options.

Unless you have a friend with a PHD for building in this game and have the 5 years to learn how everything works to build anything you need, don't get this game. If you want it to build your own rescue craft and do rescue missions, try a cheap unity asset flip simulator game. If you want to mess around with the weapons DLC, get SimplePlanes. You want to go to space with their new DLC? Kerbal space program. All of these other options are better than the LONG hours just understanding how a simple mechanical block functions one youtube video after another and also may just be cheaper than this game + the DLC you want to try.

As for me, I apparently am a masochist and will be continuing to curse the devs for their absolute lack of in game explanations as I continue to try to build abominations that should not function but by pure Mcdonald employee determination and duct tape they somehow do.",1698027083,1698027083,False,3,0,0.512658238410949707,2,True,False,False

1. Multiplayer issues. For example. If the host opens the map, all the other players will lag, always. NPCs will sometimes be in different locations for different players. 

2. Missions bugs. For example. Rescue missions will occasionally not complete when you take a NPC to their safe zone/destination. (worse in multiplayer)

Although there is one thing that bugs me, the auto-save feature. I feel like it's too situational and needs customization with it in the settings or something to make it more frequent because if anything happens that causes you to reset the game, you are forced to go back to when the auto save was or even worse, the base. 

I also would like to address the weird save files, It feels unorganized and there are no photos of the save game so since all the games are set to the same world name (unless you change it). I just wish there were photos of the save so it wasn't confusing.

I love this game for it's simple art style proving a game can be fun even if the graphics are from the PS1. 

Last thing, I really wish there was role-play servers for this game because it feels like this game thrives in a multiplayer environment. I don't have friends who play this game all the time so if there was a better multiplayer environment, I think it would increase the player count if the game supported that.

Stormworks is a unique sandbox game made by some of the most incompetent, low-effort, scammy developers ever. i cannot express my disappointment in the direction of the game enough.

Multiplayer was never fixed despite their promises to do so, its still a broken laggy mess even moreso now, and they continue to release half-baked poorly made DLCs for any extra profit they can squeeze out of this community.

Leaving the earlier for posterity.

They added weapons, so great! But I'm keeping it 7/10 though.

I'm a big nerd boy who is a big fan of space.... But this isn't what the game needs.

Pressurization and different gasses. awesome! But you can have loose objects in an enclosed space and the pressure up to near 500 but loose objects wont budge under ""explosive"" decompression. so no cannons to launch stuff. Maybe a engine limitation.

But my biggest, largest hangup is the lack of pulleys in this game. Want a small-ish vehicle with a decent tow line? Cant put the winch under the deck, no aft deck for you.

[list]
[*] Spawn any airtight ship and shoot it. Watch as it becomes a black hole sucking everything in. This makes most combat basically impossible.
[*] Now imagine the same thing as above but now it's in the form of a box that people spawn to grief servers. Instant black hole.
[*] Steam engines are extremely weak now and barely operate.
[*] They broke most relevant missions with lua with zero warning because idk funny (see: vehicle id changes).
[*] Added a radioactive fluid that you're able to XML into fluid tanks. It is fluid ID 15, hereby called Fluid 15. It basically hits the float limit for radiation. It cannot be despawned manually, takes actual centuries to despawn naturally, and irradiates a large area. Low effort server griefing. Thanks Dan.
[*] As far as I'm aware despawning oil spills (which lag badly) through code still crashes the game.
[*] There is still no way to non-xml / non-cheating delete C02 from sealed containers. Same with nitrogen. You can technically do it with industrial centrifuges but you need the industrial DLC for that and I feel like that's not intentional regardless. You also can't get more oxygen on the moon despite comments about ice mining on the moon (as far as I've seen, there's no ice or ore on the moon). This means all space trips are on a time budget before you suffocate.
[*] Ground clipping is infinitely worse than it's ever been. GLHF if you hit the moon slightly too hard because you'll be stuck in the ground.
[*] Infinite saving bug happens frequently now making it impossible to quit the game without task manager. Everything is lost on shutdown.
[*] Most pressure systems / nozzles / pipes leak. A lot. This is non intentional.
[*] An unbelievable number of sealed spaces either vacuum air for no reason as soon as they spawn and don't stop or launch you into space on opening despite being not filled with anything.
[*] Sometimes sealed compartments just crush you for no reason. This isn't ""i'm suffocating"", this is ""holy shit im inside a vacuum chamber / hydraulic press"". Why does it do it? Who knows. Honestly more likely to crush than suffocate now, they nerfed the suffocation rate.

The cry and scream to drive the game completely multiplayer and shy away from the single player side of it. There is only so much optimization they cam work into a game engine.

Devs fixed their game, and it only took them one day to roll out the hotfixes.

[h1]General review[/h1]
Stormworks is a vehicle building oriented sandbox game.
With a logic system and an in-game Lua scripting system for both vehicle logic and game addons.

[h3]Addons[/h3]
The game is also highly customizable with it's addon system:

[b]Don't like natural disasters?[/b]
Turn off the natural disasters addon, and the natural disasters option in the missions addon.

[b]Don't like warfare?[/b]
Turn off the weapons AI

[b]Default addons not good enough?[/b]
Look up improved versions of the default addons or any other on the workshop.
(Toastery's Improved Conquest Mode is a perfect example of this.)

[h3]Difficulty[/h3]
The game might be a bit intimidating to new players, but rest assured... it is.
But not in a bad way, after the first several hours you'll have your first vehicle.
And it will most likely not be up to your expectations thus tempting you into developing
and honing your vehicle building skills so that the next one will be.
[b]This game might not be easy to learn but it's hard to master (the latter being a good thing).[/b]

It has a variety of stuff to do, you can kinda build any land, sea or air vehicle you can think of...
though the physics might be a bit off... or maybe a bunch. As of now there's no actual armour block.
But you can still achieve something similar with spaced armour and banning HE. As for the high drag...
for some reason increasing the weight of a vehicle decreases it's drag.
So there's that if you wanna go supersonic. It might not be 100% realistic (or even 75%), but it's still
somehow a very good simulation game.

[b]I definitely recommend this game[/b]",1697153262,1697774544,True,0,0,0.536029458045959473,0,True,False,False

I am [b]disappointed[/b] by the lack of intuitively understandable and interconnected gameplay mechanics. In Stormworks, there is an interesting structure for building mechanisms, but for independent creativity, one needs to rely on YouTube tutorials. The developers at [strike]Geo[/strike][b]Urinemetra[/b] chose not to include comprehensive training in the introductory process, apparently considering this feature unnecessary. [i]Sarcasm*[/i] It's truly fun and exciting to constantly interrupt the gameplay to look at an out-of-order instruction manual for building a ""bicycle"". By the way, the mini-map is also missing, probably for the sake of realism.
[quote=Geometra] Stormworks: Build and Rescue is [b]a rich and dramatic physics playground[/b]. Take your custom-designed, block-based and programmable vehicles into fierce oceanic storms. [b]Plan and execute[/b] thrilling rescues in a variety of challenging crisis scenarios. [b]Export and share[/b] your meticulously designed vehicles and missions with other players via the Steam workshop.  [/quote]
[b]""A rich and dramatic physics playground""[/b] actually lacks any landscape features and consists of monotonous plains that pose no challenge. [b]Physics is absent[/b], and attempts to do something unconventional quickly come to an end. A small building block behaves the same as any other massive structure. It is merely an arcade game claiming to have quality execution but without any distinctive features. Regarding the issues of water or air transportation, everything has already been said before me, and I don't see much point in repeating it. I will only say that judging by the reviews over the past few years since the release, practically nothing has changed.

[b]""Plan and execute""[/b] consists of a simple task [b]X[/b] with a random location of event [b]A[/b] and a final route to point [b]B[/b], followed by receiving financial reward. And that's pretty much it. You can start over and repeat the algorithm again and again until you get bored. The generation of random events in itself is strange and inconsistent. No planning happens, of course, especially considering the randomly generated victims with an invisible timer that kills them when it ends. And this could be a challenge if the game had a more clear reward system. However, in reality, there are no consequences and you can skip such missions indefinitely.

""[b]Export and share[/b]"" if you are willing to spend dozens, if not hundreds of hours watching video guides from a third-party platform. Otherwise, you are left with using ready-made build templates from other people. Need I explain that with this approach, things are not so simple? Instead of enthusiastically and greedily consuming game content, I have to start from scratch every time I want to do something on my own. The game literally provides a sandbox and a form, but does not explain how to use them.

Based on the outcome, the following picture emerges. The developers made serious mistakes with the recent update, which drew excessive attention from players. Interestingly, they were unable to compensate for this with their presence. They quietly released minor fixes and left everything else as is. According to [strike]Geo[/strike][b]Stupidmetra's[/b] logic, I should meekly endure the release of a broken product at full cost. What is even more discouraging is that none of the developers have made any mention of there being anything in the new expansion that could even slightly justify its final cost. They simply ignore this fact and refuse to respond to players' questions and requests. Frankly, such an attitude is disappointing and breeds distrust.

The activity of the community surrounding this game is also very concerning. Judging from the reviews and discussions, the game is almost dead. Players express their disappointment, leave negative reviews, and warn others not to spend their hard-earned money on this game and its expansions, which are absolutely not worth the money.

So, if someone has read this to the end, my advice is to not support this [b]crap[/b], and don't spend your money on a product that is far from perfect and doesn't deserve your time and attention. And, of course, I will repeat my argument from the beginning. If the game was a product of [b]early access[/b], there would have been significantly fewer complaints. However, since it positions itself as a complete work, the demand for it should be accordingly. I would like to specifically draw the attention of [b]supporters[/b] with hundreds and thousands of hours of gameplay, as well as [b]creators[/b], to the fact that indifference on this matter often leads to [b]projects folding[/b]. It would be nice to have a thorough review, but who am I to ask for it. Thank you for your attention.",1697376531,1697670138,False,4,1,0.46331489086151123,0,True,False,False

Then this is the game for you!

Overall, the fixes are nice but there's piles of problems yet to be fixed still, and there's 0 transparency from the devs on any of it. 

I suggest not purchasing, not until the devs fix their communication issues, and failure to make fixes to the community's issues.

Also we're still waiting on an apology from the devs for this mess.

EDIT:
Whoo boy, they made the Apology, and guess what, they're blaming the people whom make criticisms and whom also ask for some genuine Quality Control, even going so far as to place criticizing their game at the same level as physical threats. Seems the devs have learned nothing and are only looking for the quick way out!

Haven't said a single threat, made a single review because I want a better quality of game, and apparently I'm the problem? Despite the lack of quality for the past several updates and blatant money grab DLCs?

Good luck, you're gonna need it cause idk how much longer that the rest of the community is gonna stay under you if you treat the people trying to actively improve the game with criticism this way.

I suggest watching these for a proper understanding of the drama: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_GnE752j3M

But using your personally builded is not less pleasure :) Very interested thing is microcontrollers, using easy, lots of features and possibilites. A control pannels is builded by player, its have large amount of blocks to work at, much amount of creative experience & easy-to-understand wiring iterface. The power machines (engines, modular/steam/electric/nuclear) is the part to mid-easy understand and one of the first priority: you can't run without power... Or can ;) With your legs or wind force :) There are solar cells, but it maded real-life like, so mostly useless (except low-power devices, like lamps, logic etc).
As resume: just at least try it, build your very-first very-simple ship/car/train/plane (NOT! Plane is more coplicated, would not recommend to start at this point), drive it, understand upgrades to your vehicle/vessel, upgrade, drive again and so on :) It can take you hours/days in exchange for much ingeneering experience and fun!
Add: yeah, liquid physycs (water, salt water, oil, gasoline, jet fuel) at the best, you can use build-in tanks, but can create just enclosed (or not) colume for that and lunp it in/out (which lets you build huge ships, consuming megaliters of fuels, or purposes vessel balance/sinking, like a subs - or create a sub! Why not?)
Opt: Weapon expansion is fun too, especially in multyplayer (did I mention multyplayer? Not? Well, it is here & works fine :) )

The devs then made an announcement saying they admit they should have tested the non-space update part of the game (the part people had already paid for), but they were too focused on the new features. Props for at least admitting failure, however, this is not the first incident like this... they fail to learn from their mistakes. Let me remind you that [b]there is no publisher forcing deadlines[/b] on the dev team - the deadline to release the DLC was put in place by them - so they chose to release the update and DLC [b]knowing large parts were untested[/b]. They then claim the review bombing of the game was a targeted attack by a vocal minority that was unfair. In my opinion, if you release broken, bad, updates, receiving bad reviews is absolutely par for the course. They then complained about receiving ""death threats"", which, fair enough, is terrible, but they seem to have taken it as a chance to (again) invalidate a lot of the [b]very valid[/b] criticism (even the non-extremely phrased criticism). Many people are very passionate about the game, they want to see it become better and better - updates such as these lead to extreme tension between the community and developers. The devs are notably [b]terrible[/b] at receiving, accepting, and improving from criticism.

They have had testing branches before, they get rid of it every time after not receiving ""the feedback they are looking for"", whatever that may be.

[b]If the above is to tell you anything, it is to indicate the continued trends of the game and its developers[/b].

------ Previous review from 28 Mar, 2021 -------

I [b]do not recommend the game[/b], however, I will start with the good to be fair.

[h3]The good of Stormworks:[/h3]

- A pretty amazing community around it that has 100% kept the game alive. You can find people who can help with design, logic, Lua, and much more around the community and the majority of people are nice and willing to help. 

- One of the absolute best logic systems I have seen in any game. You get a lot of control over different sensors and components and you get to wire them up with AND gates, OR gates, binary composite, Lua programming, etc.

- A very interesting concept where the player creates their own vehicles for their own company/organization to complete missions

- Custom mission creation which [i]could[/i] allow the creation of lots of different awesome games within the game

- The ability to build many types of vehicles from tanks, to trains, to planes or even random things like wind mills, generators, buoys, etc. Chances are, you can find a way to build nearly everything in the game, take a look at the workshop

While all the things listed above make the game sound amazing for programmers, artists, and engineers, the devs have been leaning on those positives as a crutch hoping the good points of the game can keep the community content and entertained. Lately, the devs have been working hard on implementing new features, however, there are many, many problems with the game that are much more urgent than adding nuclear engines.

[h3]The bad of Stormworks:[/h3]

- There are [b]countless[/b] unbalanced parts in the game (super drag, low buoyancy, completely ineffective solar cells, etc.) that have been dismissed by the dev/admin team for seemingly ridiculous reasons. For example, when asked why certain things didn't weigh realistic amounts of kg, the admin team responded by removing the kg from the game in order to, and I quote: ""stop discussions of mass""

- There are [b]countless[/b] bugs that have been dismissed, ignored, and I suppose just silently made lower priority than adding new features (that will certainly come with more bugs)

- The game left early access out of nowhere and the stability of the game has not improved much at all. The stable branch is like any other game's experimental branch and the experimental branch is like a dev testing branch, just public as the devs don't appear to do any internal testing for many, many parts of the updates

- The [url=mcro.org/issues/1]issue tracker[/url] used by the devs is absolutely unacceptable. It is very slow, insecure, violating of privacy and data laws, and just an overall mess. The search bar was removed from the site after someone performed a XSS attack that replaced it with a rick-roll, making it even more unusable. This, combined with the frequency of bugs, is enough reason to not play the game, it's that bad

- The devs only leverage one YouTuber for promotion/tutorials/Q&As (with the devs) and their name is MrNJersey. They have become basically an untouchable figure in the community as the devs will support them endlessly and they will support the devs endlessly. If the devs make a mistake and post a very broken update, MrNJersey will post a video acting as if everything is working as intended and a [i]small balance[/i] will be coming soon. Jersey's tutorials were also put into the game and there is even a function in the addon Lua API to see if a player has been notified about their existence in the game. Jersey also hosts the Q&As with the lead dev, Deltars. The videos are 45 minutes of Jersey pitching absolute softball questions and letting Deltars smash every answer out of the park, no addition questions asked. Jersey will ask how the new issue tracker is coming, Deltars will say it is on the way and will be better, Jersey will not ask how it will be better and just say ""amazing!"" and continue to the next question. It is almost like a dictator's propaganda at this point, it's that bad

- Many players, including me, have left the game and community recently as we are tired of the above issues and there is no improvements in sight. Some of the smartest, most helpful, and best players in the game have left recently either on their own accord or due to being banned/muted on the dev's Discord server

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]
If you only plan on messing around in other people's creations, the game could maybe be worth it for you. If you want to actually build stuff in the game, you will spend the first 1000hrs understanding the basics and improving but you will quickly come to the same realization many of us have soon after. Perhaps the game will improve in a year or two...

If you want even more context, I highly recommend reading this:

The physics in this game are so, mindbogglingly janky, there's atleast a 50/50 chance when trying to climb onto your boat you'll launch yourself out of the water like Aquaman, fly right over and then get stuck underneath. 

If you buy this prepare to fall off your boat and get run over by it more than once, it was funny the first time I guess but goodness me does it get old quick. Eventually you'll manage to rescue a few people and then realise that every single mission is basically the same thing. ""Go here, put out fire, pick up person, put them in boat, go to hospital"" and if you decide to try and offload patients at a hospital ship I hope you're wearing your patience-pants because the aforementioned physics are going to actively work against you. I suppose if you're into pain you'll enjoy the experience but I'd rather just do something else.

Asking on the official Discord doesn't help, the community seems real nice but they only really seem to want to talk about pressurising gasses in the new space DLC. There are a ton of videos online but even the ""beginner"" tutorials are frustratingly complicated.

There are countless forum posts complaining about the devs removing features and not fixing stuff that's broken. Apparently you used to be able to use a HOTAS in this game but when I plugged mine in my throttle axis were mapped to rotational view. I spent a while spinning in circles before I figured that out and it may have been the most fun part of my experience. Oh and you can't remap that, not that it would help if you could because you can't map an axis to the throttle input, only keypresses.

Since the entire point of the game seems to have changed to blowing things up and going to space, (DLCs), if you want to play it for the SAR aspect like I did you're probably not going to have a good time.

If you want to build your own ships and blow stuff up just play From The Depths and if your aim is to go to space then KSP still exists.

This game is honestly as shallow as a puddle and even though I bought it on sale I still feel like I've been robbed blind. I feel like I should have been paid for playing this game.",1697483214,1697483214,False,5,0,0.478220641613006592,0,True,False,False

I want to like this game so badly. I want it to be good and fun and realistic and challenging. I've spent a lot of time building various crafts and testing them out and figuring out how all the systems work. And it was in this part that my experience started to sour. The physics break down badly once you start tinkering. Being able to custom-build my own modular engines to my exact specifications sounded amazing until I started to realize that the physics make no sense and produce painfully inadequate power for their size/weight. And don't get me started on the insane mechanics of jet engines or the nuclear reactors and their boilers/turbines. 

When I manage to build something that works well enough AND that doesn't exploit some super-cheesy nonsense physics, I am disappointed again because I take my wondrous new craft out into a world that... just doesn't reward or interest me. The default frequency of disasters, combined with their extensive variety and the time it takes to get anywhere with our awful power-to-displacement ratio, means the map will perpetually be covered in various disasters, most of which I simply cannot do anything about realistically. As an example, if I built a submarine, why am I being given forest fire missions? If I built a search-and-rescue boat, why am I being fired upon by random other boats?

Instead of trying to fix it and flesh out the core gameplay (the career search and rescue) they completely abandoned it, added in a war DLC which was poorly thought out and doesn't work well, added an industrial DLC which is okay I guess but is limited to one island, and now they are going far and way from the original concept by adding space.

So to start of, I've played the game since 2018 and took a break in 2020 and after 2000 hours (4k at time of revision) I think its time to actually write a proper review.

Gameplay:
3/10
The game [b]USED[/b] to be a challenge, the missions were challenging and had you made specialized vehicles (especially the tanker one) and they had variation. This all changed with the mission update, which didn't add content but removed the old decent content and replaced it with go to x on map locate vehicle put out fire and bring npc's to a hospital, which was ok the first 2 times but it gets old really quickly. Then you might say ""but the workshop fixes this"" in which you would be right to some degree the workshop missions are decent, but that's not the point the old missions were fine why replace them with these boring missions.
But in the end this entire section literately doesn't matter because no one plays career lol.

Editor:
9/10
This is [b]GOLD[/b], out of the games that I've played this has the best editor. It feels intuitive, has the right tools & seems to be fairly stable. There is only one thing I wish the devs would add in the editor: Saved toolbars, like in minecraft have saved toolbars so that you can quickly switch between the blocks you want.


But why is this review not recommending the game?
It feels like the game only goes downhill, the new radars are bad for what i use them for (which is missiles and yes they are supposed to be used with missiles) so I use the old ones which get jammed by propellers, only have 1 target output & only have one axis of measurement to use. an other example of the game going downhill would be the lastest update (as of 10-2-2022) which completely broke aerodynamics and allowed vehicles to go mach jesus while they shouldn't be able to do that.
More things in this list:
[list]
 [*]Modular engine's are insane to cool
 [*]The air has the consistancy of a well known white sticky liquid
 [*]It feels like the devs don't test the game, more on this later.
 [*]Update brakes my missiles, like every time (not only missiles at this point)
 [*]Devs are not in contact with the community
 [*]Game is still in beta (well its technically not it certainly fails like it)
[/list]

Recently (as the latest update to this review) the space DLC has released and with that the pressure update. The pressure update doesn't through out a system it's on a component basis (susceptible to tick delay and causes really weird issue's related to fluids (gasses and liquids), beside the way the fluid system rework is done the launch (of the update/DLC) is absolutely botched while they have started fixing the game it shows the absolute attitude that has been given to the update and what is wrong with the games update cycle. Beginner (one of the devs) has admitted to not testing the core components of the game before releasing a major patch, how is that supposed to work??? They work on a update for months and don't test it, that seems like they could've made a pre-release version of the game public for beta testing, which we had at one point why is it gone we should have/get this asap.
Then there is also the bi weekly minor update, this is a non-maintainable pace for the game in my opinion, I'd rather have medium sized updates once per 2 months or maybe once per month, where quality is a number 1 point instead of a after thought.

These things have made me think about if I should recommend this game, and I don't feel like I should. While I absolutely love this game it has its more then fair share of problems, and it feels as if they aren't being addressed, which just is kinda depressing.

Much love,
Connor

[list]
    [*] The game is mega focused on MP, and feels downright dead if played alone. The barrier to entry for basic construction of vehicles requires a nation wide effort with the help of YouTube, Google and, hell... Reddit.
    [*] Adding to the previous point, after all that research is done you'll just realize that an update made that your boat don't float.
    [*] New content, say the Industrial Frontier one are pretty bland, and add things that in my opinion should be in the base game, but that's put behind a paywall.

Many bugs, updates adding half baked features and little interest in fixing them. Many incomplete/buggy/useless features and a two paid DLCs after 1.0 release and the game feels worse than before 1.0

Buy only if you enjoy finding desing workarouds to overcome game bugs and other weird ""features"".
Weird? yes. Unrealistic? Doesn't matter as long as it doesn't feel ""incorrect"". The average player would expect better performance from a nuclear reactor powered ship than a coal steam piston ship, less drag from more streamlined designs, ability to swim backwards.... Not in this game. There are many unexpected (note I don't use the word unrealistic) behaviours. 

Refrigeration for modular engines is a joke. Mission system seems void and repetitive. Natural disaster system is funny for the first 2 hours, after that, a new tsunami every 40 minutes is a serious call for natural disaster deactivation (sorry, you have to begin a new game for that).

On the positive: You will enjoy playing this game if you  like to design and build vehicles, test your creations, tune them for better performance or usability and decorate them, if you don't care about some bugs and the apparent unwillingness to fix them. 
I would like to recommend this game, but, sadly, this is another forever-beta tittle.

This is perfectly represented by the game's most recent DLC as of writing this, the Space DLC, which the devs admitted themselves has to use a lot of really cheaty workarounds in order to make it fit in with the actual code foundations of the game. 

You might think this isn't inherently an issue, but what baffles me is that they decided that they would make a second game, also based around vehicle building, and not have the space features to be integrated with that game, built from the ground up, so that it may have a more stable implementation in a game that was built with those mechanics in mind.

Instead, they have put these features into a game that is already struggling to keep up with the ever-increasing amount of features that go completely unpolished before being released to the public inevitably breaking the game.

The game is fun and playable again, and the devs gave an apology while taking full responsibility to what happened. (Which is the most mature thing they could've done in that situation). 

I've played this game for two years, and it is by far one of my favourite games. It allows a lot more freedom and creativity than found in many other games, and I highly recommend it. Stormworks is one of those games that are hard to learn at first, but after a week or two of playing, you quickly start to get the hang of things. (There are plenty of tutorials and examples that you can look at to get a better understanding).

Ignore the comments that say: ""Stormworks is bust and the devs don't care.""
Like I mentioned above, the devs have fixed things and gave an apology. Stormworks is 'relativity' back to normal now. 
Also, quick advice: The best DLC to buy (in my opinion) is the 'Search and Destroy'. The other DLCs in terms of CONTENT are okay, but still fun to play. Only buy a DLC if you ABSOLUTELY want it. (Then again, I guess you could always refund it if you don't like it).

Space DLC just dropped and boy is the game broken, although the devs are actively fixing the game as I write this review.

The main reason I dont suggest getting this game, is because it tries to do everything, and it just doesnt feel like a sandbox build and rescue game anymore. The best way i can accurately describe the game is an all you can eat resturant; the resturant has everything you could possibly want and you can eat as much of it as you want, but the food isnt great. I feel like at this point in the game, career isnt the same anymore because you are constantly running around servicing rescue missions, and the dlc's dont correlate at all. One minute you get a mission to rescue a stranded boat in the middle of the ocean that is on fire, the next your getting a space mission of a stranded space station? and having to fend off against the enemies in the weapons dlc? It just doesnt fit.

Another thing is every major update, you end up needing to relearn everything, i havnt been playing that long, but ever since the update with the space dlc came along, i have to worry about pressure inside the hull of my ships and whatnot, which ends in my ship having vacuum chambers in each compartment, which is pretty fucking wild if you ask me. 

So yeah, i kinda dont feel like relearning the entire game, was fun while it lasted, hope the devs are able to fix the game!

gotta note, i only own the weapons dlc so my review might be biased, but thats pretty much what i got from the dlc

This is a Super fun game and i highly recommend you play it especially if you like engineering and building things the only thing that sort of sucks is the bugs that come up but they usually fix them fairly quick.
But even with the bugs its still very fun game to play as you can probably see with the amount of hours that i have in it. 99.9999% would recommend!)

New Review:
I still kinda agree with that review, but that was 4 years ago and 1.0+ has been out for a long time now. The Devs have still not gotten their act together with there updates, every update still comes with some sort of game breaking bug. And this most recent Space DLC update is no exception, This update is just the straw that broke the camels back for the community and they are getting a lot of backlash for it, as they should. They keep acting like their the victims, like they did nothing wrong and they do not deserve the criticism. They absolutely ignore the community at every turn and only choose to listen to their Simps. I WISH I could love this game again but I just cannot deal with this BS, I cant be having all my creations breaking in one way or another every couple weeks. This game had great potential The Devs just shit on the game thought, the only thing they care about is that sweet sweet cash. I have looked on the UK Company Registry multiple times and they are making pretty good bank now. Its honestly just sad because as you can see I have gotten so many hours of game time(almost 2,500 hours) so it clearly is a good game. I just cant be having this kind of childish behaviour from them. Things Like Banning people from the Official storm works Discord for speaking up, Reporting and deleting Discord servers where these banned people go to, Not supporting modding in any way what so ever, even thought it makes the game so much better; And then going on to ban a lot of those Moders from the Discord too. It is completely Unacceptable.

Anyway I could keep bringing up more and more points, but I will stop here Otherwise this will get way too long.
And if the Devs do get their acts together then I will Update this review to be positive, because to be honest this type of game should deserve it. but it just doesn't right now.

The only good dlc is the weapons dlc that was actually good as it added a whole new thing that we have been asking for in stormworks for a while and thankfully we got it. The Industrial dlc was a bit boring as all it really did was add a new section to the map which is alright I guess. But its our fault because the criticism for denouncing the game after a team of utterly ego driven developers (not saying all of you are but who ever thought the idea of releasing that announcement certainly is)

We've been having issues with storm works for a while now laden with bugs and glitches and poor optimisation. That still hasn't been fixed.

Deaths threats were never necessary and everyone should be mentally mature for saying that ♥♥♥♥ isn't right. But review bombing is certainly justified by this disastrous launch. Here's what you should of done from the get go. TEST THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UPDATE. Have a open beta program and/or a closed beta program because gamers know that it's in testing and they'll give you a heads up before you publicly embarrass the entire the dev team. For ♥♥♥♥ sakes guys learn from now on to test your ♥♥♥♥ before you release it. Most developers when they test miss a lot of ♥♥♥♥ that gamers do so that's why there is open/closed betas for people besides the developers to test the game so they can spot things that developers of the game can not. DONT RELEASE A NEW DLC NEXT YEAR. It'll completely ♥♥♥♥ up your PR if you mess up that one three times in a row.

The addition of AI vehicles has not helped with the illusion of a living world as the captains of these vessels will blithely attempt to land during a tsunami or sail straight into a tornado, once their vehicle is wrecked an sunk they will simply sit at their controls and attempt to restart the engine over and over until you get far enough away for them to despawn.

Ok, let me start with the current state of the game, at the time of writing this review. Wow. Just wow. Is all I can say about that. Literally, almost everything is FUBAR. Devs say they changed one small thing right before release, which caused this. I highly doubt it, and if so, shouldn't a release be postponed if you are still making changes so close to release and you cannot test them properly? (Tip: don't ask these kinds of questions on the Discord)


History:

I was an active builder and had quite a few workshop items, with a niche crowd that liked them. I also often assisted people with issues on the forums. On the other hand, I was vocal about the things I would like to see improved in the game on the forums (more missions, some basic AI for the sock puppet survivors, more management aspects, more wedges/windows, better physics, etc.).

There were many players like me, who were involved in this game, but also unhappy with the state of it since 1.0 (beta) release. Even players actively working with the devs, for example in creating better documentation on LUA. At some point, many were either banned for speaking out or quit, because they couldn't put up with it anymore. This led me, personally, to go on a ""quest"" for justice. This was at the time of the dumpster fire incident, for those who know.

In my quest, I encountered hordes of f*nb**s (the SW mods utilize this word as an excuse to silence you, hence the *'s). Some of those showered me in personal attacks. I then did (or did not) report them for this and I was (or was not) subsequently banned by the SW Steam mods for spam reporting and trolling.. banned.. for life. I tried (or didn't try) to appeal this harsh decision. Alas, the need to silence me was too strong, as I was getting too much support from other players who were also fed up.
So no more workshop items for the community, no more helping new players out with my 3k hours of building and LUA experience. A sad state of affairs. Of course this deserved a scathing review about the state of the game and the way the dev team and moderators handle their business.


What happened next:

However, after the industry DLC dropped, I felt that the devs were finally picking back up the work of fleshing out the career mode again, of which they scrapped most of the meat at 1.0 beta release (it's interesting to go look at the steam guide that lists all the old missions). Thus, even though the devs had treated me and many others so poorly, just for stating our opinions, I removed the previously written scathing review, as I am someone who believes in second chances.

Fast forward to the release of the ""what is this doing here"" (space)-DLC. Which is not even why my review is negative. Everybody can want or not want space in this game, it is a moot point to me at this junction.


Why it IS negative:

The problem with Stormworks is this:

The devs are like a Jack Russell with too many toys, they didn't stick to the formula of the game after 1.0, they didn't stick with any of the DLC they introduced, none of it even has much interaction. To illustrate; just some examples of what could be interesting off the top of my head:

- You could make containers with nuclear waste for the logistics portion of the game, that would require you to be prepared for a potential nuclear waste spill, should something go wrong.

- You could add military vehicles as some form of special transport missions.

- There could be an ""event"" where the AI can commit some form of atrocity (intended or unintended), so there's a mass casualty event that requires more than [put out fire, toss meat slabs in boat, bring them to hospital].

But OK, enough of that. I am sure you get the picture.

Their lack of any type of attention span also causes any and all updates and DLC to come out somewhere between averagely- and severely broken. And a lot of things that are broken do not get fixed, because.. lack of attention span. Lack of attention span is my most optimistic view, more nefarious reasons could exist on their part in reality. For example, when you try to report bugs that I suspect they don't want to fix, they are marked as duplicate of something wildly different, or they cast the ""cannot reproduce""-magic spell to make it go away.

Meanwhile, each and every time some or all of the above happens the following situation is the result:

1- Players with a lot of experience, who have witnessed previous FUBAR situations will be fed up and take to the forums and Discord to express their displeasure.

2- Players who have not been here that long and/or who don't build that much or build without a certain degree of complexity will have no idea of the annoyances you encounter as an experienced builder and will take the devs' side. Mind you, I am not blaming these players. If you don't know, you don't know, it's that simple.

3- That then causes even more frustration with the experienced players, who then become more persistent in their efforts to expose Geometa for their practices and/or attempt to get them to change their ways.

4- Said experienced players get banned.. EVERY TIME.. And from what I am observing, I am guessing this is often a long or permanent ban, like I did (or didn't) get. I can only conclude that there is actual nefarious intent there, in order to stop people who have witnessed their previous behavior to spread the word to potential new buyers.


Therefore, my recommendation is now firmly:

Do NOT buy this game or any DLC or even a different game from Geometa until such a time that they consistently, over a longer period of time, have proven that they have bettered their ways. Meaning that:

- They do not release clearly un- (or barely) tested updates/DLC.
- They consistently and promptly fix/implement their HUGE backlog of bugs and requested features.
- Furthermore, the banning of critical voices MUST STOP! I, too, was (or was not) silenced and this is (or isn't) my last and only method to warn people.


Whether you are someone who uses mostly workshop creations or someone who will likely be attracted to the engineering aspects, this negative cycle WILL at some point affect you.

- If you are a downloader, your favorite creations might randomly stop working because of Geometa's actions, or disappear completely from the workshop, because your favorite creator was banned.

- If you think you will really enjoy the engineering side of things and you absolutely MUST buy it because.. reasons, then I can't stop you. BUT KNOW THIS; it will be a wonderful ride at first, truly. You will discover things about logic, coding LUA and a whole slew of real world principles that you will randomly stumble into studying for hours on end. You will smell roses and the sun will shine every day... BUT... You WILL hit a wall at some point. A wall of bugs, glitches, hours and hours spent trying to find workarounds for flaws in Geometa's systems and the incredibly sour feeling when they randomly change something that is not in the changelogs that completely breaks something you worked on for hundreds of hours. Furthermore, you will at some point start to notice that there isn't much else to do, outside of building things. You build them, but there is no gameplay loop in place for you to enjoy what you built for more than a few trips/missions. At some point, it will start to feel like an abusive relationship. You keep getting hurt, but you keep wanting to come back, because you experienced how wonderful it can sometimes be and there's nothing like it. But it will never feel the same as it did in the time of sunshine and rose petals...

Consider yourself warned!

As of now, bouancy is more generally screwed ; a barge should never be flipping over, but it is what is happening

This game has lost all of his charm in one update, it was the only game to offer this kind of gameplay [i](from what I am aware of)[/i], and it was a blast playing it, but now unless a miracle from the devs,

I was very disappointed with the beginner experience and I feel misled by the videos on the store page. I determined that Stormworks is a sandbox for building vehicles and provides almost nothing in terms of a guided experience. The tutorial is very poor and left me thinking ""Is this how this is supposed to work?"".  The starter boat looks like it's filled with water. The game also gives you no other boats, you have to go to the Steam workshop to get something pre-made. After the very short tutorial you are set loose with no anchor. There are no packaged missions like I expected, just a career mode with generated ""missions"" filled with jankyness.  Right after the tutorial I get a notification of a boat in trouble.

There are many, many negative things about it because it basically screwed up the whole game and obliterated hundreds and thousands of hours of people's time worth working on creations. Youtuber Icemonster360 has a whole video about this which will be linked here for more explanation on the recent update: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wE-SAtQszo

Further more, it wasn't just the space update that broke things but just about every single update ever released has the potential to break everything and has in fact happened before thousands of times. Needless to say the community isn't happy about all of this in the slightest and if anything are outraged. But unfortunately the devs don't care nor pay proper attention to people's opinions which is a reason people get banned on the game's discord server for critique and feature suggestions and don't even give a single crap about their game and community making matters a hell of a lot worse. The game not only has various bugs but has many unrealistic aspects as well such as terribly unrealistic engines, vehicle damage, vehicle damage from small bumps on the ground with road vehicles specifically, and I could keep on going for eons about this game being terrible and unrealistic.

Edit: As of 12/10/2023, with the catastrophic launch of the Space DLC, the Stormworks devs have managed to break* the majority of current (unrelated to space) systems in the game. While they did overhaul the subgrid and pressure mechanics, which would've had an effect on how things such as submarines behave, this change has somehow found its way to the surface and is causing the already unrealistically low buoyancy of ships to sink (pun intended) even deeper into absurdity. Along with ships, subgrid interactions, jet engines, diesel engine cooling and nuclear/steam boiler cycles have been affected as well, in ways that should not be happening given the changes made. How problems this crucial to the basic game mechanics weren't caught during testing is unknown to me.


*The biggest problems have since been fixed, with work ongoing to fix the smaller problems. However, this is not the first time this has happened, and most likely wont be the last. I can only speculate what went wrong at Geometa for bugs so glaring to make it all the way to release.

I have been in major support of the devs in the past, however, time and time again they have proven that they are either incompetent, or do not care for this game. With this current DLC launch, they have made major changes to the base game in order to comply with this new content, yet neglected to play test any of it. The result: a load of bugs and other issues that have ruined many, if not all, of the creations many creators, like myself, have spent months working on. Their response: ban the majority of people who raise these concerns from their discord, and shadow ban them from the Bug Reports and idea suggestions. The DLC has been out for a couple days now, and the Devs have released a couple ""quick fixes"" that resolved a couple of the issues, however, there are MANY more that still need to be tackled. Its also abundantly obvious, that the developers took no time to try and optimize the DLC and these new mechanics in any way, shape, or form. I am not a developer, but when you have creations that normally ran at perfect frames now running at less than half, that is a serious issue. Im praying that the developers get around to it,l but I am highly skeptical. I, personally, am now refusing to support these developers until they get their act together and realize that they should not release updates and DLC until they have, at the bare minimum, tested the entire game for any bugs or issues that may come from it, and then spend some time sitting down and fix the long long list of bugs that are already in the game that they refuse to address (that was a run on sentence, I apologies). I mean it when I say I love this game, and I do not want to be annoyed, or pissed whenever the devs release a new update.

""Feature Creep"" is a problem this game suffers from first the weapons dlc then the industries dlc and now space? that's a huge jump for a search and rescue game. the devs have put far too much work into these and in turn have neglected features that are much needed such as basic optimization of physics, a borderless windowed mode which is necessary for some of this games more in-depth features that are *VERY* well done 


instead of fixing bugs or adding features that the community have been *BEGGING* for, what do the devs do? add guns, animals and space... What? Why?

Generally the devs seem much more focused on features *no-one* asked for and ignore what needs to be done 

TLDR: Feature Creep and general lack of polish. until the devs fix all the issues, don't buy this until they do i will be probably not be putting more hours in. unfortunately

However, the latest update has prompted community outrage including review bombing (which was completely deserved by the way). The bugs have mostly been fixed by now, though they should never have existed in the first place, and the devs have apologised. 

I'm changing my review because I don't see how it helps anymore. I do not regret my negative review in the least, but, frankly, the review bombing is over and, at the end of the day, I still love Stormworks and would recommend it to anybody.

The game is great, but the devs don't care about you until you start costing them money. Found a bug? Good for you; you can keep it. God knows no-one is actually gong to fix it. 

Sometimes review bombing works. Sometimes you need to know when to stop. The update was untested and broke everything, and that is unacceptable. But it's fixed now and a negative review helps nobody. 

No, I'll save my negative review for the next update when we can experience all this again.",1697128320,1697302272,True,2,0,0.526881694793701172,13,True,False,False

Without going through the entire history of this game, Geometa has thrown away the artistic vision they once had to shill poorly planned and horribly executed DLC's, while breaking core mechanics at every turn. For a game that was focused on SAR and Exploration, adding weapons was definitely a choice. The Space DLC went about as well as anyone with half a brain cell expected -- horribly -- breaking [i]buoyancy[/i] of all things. Nevertheless, why these big-ticket items were (poorly) developed before [i]sails[/i] or anything else the community has been begging for, is a question only Geometa can really answer. 

Geometa claims that they tested this update extensively and just [i]missed a few things before launch[/i] but it's clear that this update did not see any serious testing time by a competent QA department. If it did, either the project manager didn't care about the bugs and shipped it anyway, or the version the QA department got was so sanitized that it bore no resemblance to the product shipped. There is no way you can argue, with a straight face, that jet engines not working over ~200 feet ASL slipped through the cracks, or that ships sinking due to broken buoyancy values was just ""missed.""

Either way, these problems are endemic, and are not exclusive to the company's mind-boggling DLC choices. For a game that you can really only have fun with by building and testing vehicles (and the workshop that handily provides resources for both), I don't think Geometa has once asked themselves whether or not any arbitrary update they make breaks core concepts of they very game they're updating. There have been countless non-DLC updates that break every vehicle in the workshop, either by accidentally breaking established systems, or by randomly fixing long-broken systems whose dysfunction you could depend upon.

Workshop creation compatibility is obviously less important than core features working as intended, and this point is more to show that there is no sense of stability, consistency, or reliability when it comes to Geometa's scattershot and opaque approach to development. Why spend 40 hours handcrafting a ship when in 2 updates you'll have to start over from scratch? Why spend time coding a complex radar system when in 3 weeks the radar system is entirely overhauled with brand new components? 

Additionally, physics are janky and have really only been getting worse since the hand-held item update. Hoses and ropes have constant ""retraction"" effects, dragging creations together slowly. Heavy aircraft slide around on the ground because wheels have no side-friction, flying is just generally impossible to do in a realistic manner, pressures can glitch inside sealed vessels at moderate speeds, crushing the player erroneously, etc. etc.

There have been several announcements in years past which, in dealing with the fallout of yet another botched update, Geometa snidely dismisses genuine criticism. As of this posting, the Space DLC hotfix announcement has them claiming that users conspired to review-bomb their products. Its not a review-bomb when its on topic and angry about changes -- it's a review -- which this most recent fallout largely has been. It's unprofessional and a bad approach to crisis management communication. 

The whole thing reeks of inexperience -- inexperience in developing long-term projects and inexperience in dealing with an active community. Stormworks had some serious potential in its early stages of development, but that potential has been strained by this dev team. I genuinely hope Geometa goes on to making bigger and better games, but I'm calling it here, this one's a wash.",1697302107,1697302107,False,50,3,0.739637672901153564,0,True,False,False

But over time it became clear that Geometa(the developers) dont have a clear goal in mind for the future of this game. Besides that, their communication with the community is incredibly bad. They outright refuse to communicate and when they do cherry pick  heavily. 

Regarding the actual gameplay: there sadly isnt any. What you see on the steam page is marketing, not actually happening in the game(anymore) The search and rescue, fire fighting and similar activities are broken and have been for a long time. When you want to build anything, no matter if car, plane or watercraft, you have to use exploits to make them work. Good example would be, boats and their bouancy. If you want to build something thats bigger than a jetsky, you will need to look up how to use certain bugs, otherwise it wont float. When you have a big boat and manage to get it to float in some logical fashion, chances are very high it sinks like a rock if you open a door. Seriously. If your cargohold is sealed, you will float. If you open a door on the deck to it, you will sink. 

Multiplayer:
Yes, it offers multiplayer. No it doesnt work. Not for me or any other person i honnestly talked to. There are signifiacnt performance and desync issues. Which are know since the release of the multiplayer and supposedly were fixed a dozen times by now. There are people who can play Multiplayer and enjoy it. Sadly i aint one of them.

DLCs:
Essentially fancy new blocks with little to no gameplay. Industry that doesnt really work, Weapons that are entirely cosmetic. Space... oh no... dont... Its bad. In a game where the basic fundamental gameplay has been broken for years, they added Space. BUt wait, not in a meaningfull way like youd expect. Its not like Kerbal Space Program or others. It is essentially a sandwich. you have the square, flat, earth, and an euqally square moon surface above in between there is alot of space, or rather nothing. There are some supposedly orbital mechanics. But the issue is, there is nothing to do there, no reason to go there.

This game has become a total crapshow. While it has completely departed from the search and rescue aspect, this isn't a crazy big deal, it just isn't the main focus anymore. The issue is that the devs are currently nothing bought money hungry liars, basically. Every single update is untested, which requires an update to fix the update, which is also untested, which then needs another update. Half the time they don't repair their shoddy work, so your creations just completely stop working. The DLC's they produce are completely untested and have broken the game several times. For example, the new Space DLC completely broke buoyancy mechanics! (This has since been hotfixed, but what does that say about how much work the dev's are putting into their DLC's?)

The devs never listen to the community, and when we only request bug fixes, all we get are more and more parts. It seems that their entire goal is to cram up the games inventory with parts that don't work or barely work at all.

[b] This game and it's developers are great. The concept is very cool, and the execution is great for how complex it is. [/b]

With the release of the space DLC the entire game broke, but as they announced, they're working on it. I myself am a game developer, and i know how much can go wrong with a code base as old as this one. You fix something very simple and tiny on one end. Test it, and it seems good. But somewhere else unrelated. suddenly everything is broken. At this point, your time is going into 75% testing, and 25% actually fixing bugs. Which is not what you want when you have acommunity waiting for updates and fixes.

So please, have respect for these people. They're doing their best, but working on code this old is a GIGANTIC task. If you've decided that you don't trust them anymore, or feel like you should make them feel bad. Take a look from their side. And if you think this was just for the money. The game is not expensive. Just take a look at so many other games that came out shit, but were priced at 60 Euro or higher. But they too took their time and effort and eventually fixed their issues.

They ignore most bug reports because they think ""It's not a bug"" or ""It's a feature"". They used to ""cherry picking"" suggested features or bug reports and leave urgent bug fixes behind. Delaying urgent bug fix causes chaos to vehicle builders, who are the most of the playerbase.

Sometimes they fixes a bug after long time from first report, the point when most builders already fixed their vehicles work properly even with the bug.
Players always be worried about update because sometimes it makes their creations broken.

When the community discovered XML editing method, they also found that they can edit buzzer sound by XML editing. Many builders used this to make their creations more fancy. But after few weeks, They blocked buzzer sound editing for no reason. Numerous of vehicles became broken. After this, one day, Devs took a Q&A stream. Deltars was there. And he said XML editing is part of building game. Then why you blocked ""A part of the XML editing""?

Even the community suggested new blocks and windows for better building experience, they also ignored them.
Square pyramid block was a most upvoted(or mentioned) feature by players. But Devs ignored it. With no reason at all.

Before the announce of the Space DLC, They leave a comment : ""This new content has been years in development"".
Is this a conclusion of ""Years in development""?
Did you forgot to fix game breaking bugs and adding useful features or blocks for years because of this worthless DLC's development?

Fix the base game first. Listen to the community. Add features what they need. Fix bugs what ""spammers"" reported and respect their works.

From the past to the present, Devs and Mods always ignored community's voices. This will continue forever when you forgive them because of this hotfix.
Don't forgive them until they listen to your voice and take the real action continuously. Until then, Don't believe them.

                                                           ----AN EDIT----

I still have faith and hope in the Stormworks Devs in that they care to fix Stormworks and make it more fun by actually being *playable.* I can hugely appreciate these kinds of small update efforts they make. It's just that other people believe they should completely prioritize optimization efforts and make it the paramount focus, which I think is a solid idea and will enable far more content than ever before. Additionally, this will save the devs from having to patch the holes their unstable engine creates whenever new shit gets implemented. I have faith and optimism, it will be a while, it will be difficult, but it is possible to fix Stormworks and it's inherently broken engine. 

Side note, the hitboxes are okay, they work, but they also limit you with occasional unreason. Maybe the devs can address these too, in a ""Hitbox Optimization Update""

CURRENT STATE EDIT:

Many mistakes and decisions have lead this game down an ever darkening path. The most recent Space DLC being one of them. In general, while I love the game and what it brings, it seems as though the development team has their priorities backwards, and is trying to extrapolate money from the playerbase.

From now on this game will sit in my library to collect dust, I am never touching it again- in fact, I am hidding it completely.

I think I can say for stormworks players that we have put a lot of time and effort in to this game. May that be though playing with friends or building creations which can take days to build. Though prototyping and the iterative process of creativity. Essentially making a successful build impossible is a failure on studios part in regard to quality control. I wouldn't expect this lack of standards within a business environment in relation to customer relations so why is acceptable here. Furthermore an admission of ones mistake goes a long way.  

On the part of the devs, releasing a DLC which makes the most of the workshop creations useless destroys what little faith I have in the devs. It looks like you're working in an echo chamber with no reflection on how the player base will be affected. 

A final point
I'll speak for myself but I never wanted a DLC like this. How about improving the missions, making them more complex and larger in scope or something like that. If you're releasing a DLC early, maybe because the studio is in need of a cash injection. How about doing some user research. What do the players want? I'm quite sure that if you made a DLC which overhauled the missions and made a better game play experience  people would buy it. Now that would be a good way to win trust back.  

This is my previous review below


Stormworks is a great game; the game is enjoyed most when playing with someone as the missions are geared around a multiplayer experience. If played solo, it's still great fun trying out workshop creations and doing missions, but you can't beat a co-op experience where players need to communicate and use teamwork. 

In short:
Positive things
The game is very enjoyable in multiplayer 
Fantastic active community with great creators who keep the game interesting with new builds
The graphics style is nice
Devs do regular updates 
The map is very big
The DLC industries is really good 

Short falls
Multiplayer can lag and destroy a game 
While there is an element of random generation, the main landmasses stay the same it's just the islands around that change
The designer feels clunky (this could just be me) 
Lack of exciting geometry blocks to create interesting shapes 
Missions lack complexity and normally revolve around variations of a 7 missions. Thats not me saying the missions types are boring but making them more complex and adding an element of problem solving within the mission would be interesting. 

There's more positives and negatives but for now, I think this gives a good representation of the game at its current state. 

I would also say the game isn't worth 19.49 maybe 15",1673979067,1697238714,False,0,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

And to the community: Stop whining about every single mistake that happens which doesnt fit into your perfekt litte world. They improved the system with the engines.

Give it some time. There are a lot of big changes and they made a bit of a screw up. We already got 2 fixes just the day after. Please, give the devs some time to work on it before losing your temper. There is no reason to promote violence.

Real review here:
While in some cases I would like to give this game a negative. I cant, this game has helped me so much in my career path, and while I still got a few years to go before uni, it has helped me so much already. 

Stormworks: Build and Rescue, isnt really a rescue game anymore. With the recent dlcs that have been released, it has become a sandbox game, with SAR elements. Which I like.

Unfortunately, the devs dont listen to their community, which in turn creates conflict between the community and them, which make the devs not listen to them even more. We need to break this cycle so this game can become better, and currently this cycle is getting worse. With the recent Space DLC, they made major changes to the physics, which has broken nearly every workshop creation. They have had a few recent hot fixes and brought ships back from the seabed (literally). 
HOWEVER, when they announced the physics changes coming, they did say that it would break nearly every workshop creation. The community was mainly like yeah lets do it, but now they are mad. IF they community truly didnt want it, they should have said no (kindly) back when it was announced - this may have not changed anything but still.

While Stormworks: Build and Rescue (in its current state) is a bit of a mess, personally, I would still buy it while its on sale (its never on sale so get it cheap while you can.)",1567144620,1697229310,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Misc/Extra Notes: 
- Computer needed depends on the type of creations you build/spawn. If you load a large creation you need to have a fast and beefy computer.
- The workshop saves stormworks, along with search and destroy but that is a DLC.
- I really recommend using a workshop creation, as it nearly impossible to build starting out as the build is insanely complex.

Don't waste your time on whiners: yeah, the game passed recently (October 2023) by a huge update, with some heavy stuff added into its core mechanics, and of course those things messed up against several existing things. But it has been fixed, and it's always being fixed.

Although there isn't an actual tutorial inside the game, if you don't wanna spend time by learning things by yourself it's REALLY easy to find both quick and long tutorials on internet.

It is NOT an action/adventure/puzzle game. It's a building/fabricating game, with a nice prone to exploration and some cool simple rescue missions within.

Regardless you need some tutorials or some nice gameplay to watch before make your mind, here are my favorite suggestions for it (these on youtube).

Stormworks has always been an empty game the NPCs do nothing besides stand there and all the animals don't do anything besides try and kill you and there is no hunting or fishing and exploring caves has nothing in them besides maybe one or two crates of money and there is no hunger system so career mode is easy just get a small speed boat with rescue and you can use that forever and what can you really do in this game, fly a plane drive a boat? Yeah that's fun but alone it's boring there are some AI boats that drive around but even the hospital boats you cant even go inside them like sorry what? I can go inside to heal and they don't stop for you it's insane how empty this AI is and how it does nothing besides try and kill you.

As a person who spent most of his time playing this game which is getting worse every update I really dont suggest even trying this game.
At first it might seem a cool sandbox game but the more you get into it, the more you ask yourself what type of substance the dev team has been smoking these years.
It seems like they're TRYING to screw up every update, not even Battlefield 2042 was this bad since they are trying to fix, even with a shitty release, yet this game is still getting worse.
Take for example the Space DLC, Broke basically everything:
-Missiles
-Boats
-physics
etc..

Many people use the excuse of: ""Umm. .. actually the devs tested space related stuff"".
This shit aint valid since in the update we got the new mechanic where subodies are counted as vehicles (ex: missiles, bombs etc..).
So my question is: Did they even bother testing this addition? 
This isnt even space related and again, this is broken since now subodies arent even synced correctly.
This shows how testing is dealt in this game that is to say: just test the related stuff to it (In some cases they still dont) and post update with no prior general testing.

Im not a game dev but I know without testing there is no fixing in first place, if they were even bothered fixing the issue",1629646310,1697197497,False,1,0,0.510489523410797119,6,True,False,False

The dlcs in my opinion aren't worth it, the new space dlc brought tonnes of bugs which broke most creations, fixed a bug which the community needed to make large boats float due to Stormwork's bad buoyancy system. Not to mention the Industrial update which is mostly barren, it brought mineral mining but nuclear now needs uranium and you cant get that without the dlc, Weapons dlc is OK but only really if you're into dogfighting. Friends do make the experience better but thats about it. IMO, the devs are mostly just making money grabs and don't care for the community and refuse to do big bug fix updates (only minor bugs and total game braking bugs may get fixed).

I really love this game. Yes, there are times when I don't go into it for a month, but it still remains my favorite game since 2019. I remember updating the generators, after which all my ships broke down, it was painful, but it was an impetus for my development. There is a new mechanics that you need to cope with, understand and adapt to it.

the weapons DLC was ambiguous for me. On the one hand, the community wanted this (how many crafts there were on this topic in the workshop). I stuck to the fact that the game is more about ""rescue people"". But after a while I got into it, I realized that this is just a new area in which I can implement my ideas. That the game is becoming more versatile.

Industrial DLC is a new huge island. That's basically all I needed. I haven't got into trains yet (who knows, maybe this day is close) But this update brought all the same emotions. There are new blocks, new tasks, new cases that can be solved in different ways. Improving your vehicle every time to achieve maximum optimization.

And now it's new. Space DLC, should I say that the game needs it? Yes, definitely. Why? For me, this is a new horizon that can be conquered. I am not a supporter of playing on other people's vehicles. (There are a lot of impeccable and simply amazing buildings in the workshop, a bunch of controllers, etc.). My approach is to come up with something of my own. Yes, it will not be perfect, but there will be a reason to improve it. And I'm looking forward to conquering space and the moon.

Nothing is perfect, and now the situation from 2019 is being repeated (like it was then), when the update broke everything for everyone. Yes, it hurts. But isn't that a reason to understand the new mechanics?

About bugs (Space DLC and more) Development is not an easy matter. And the development of the game is especially not something simple. Especially in which they try to create physics close to real.

This is not an excuse for developers who allow bugs in the game. It's still their mistake and they have to sort it out, we still paid for the game.

But be patient, fixing bugs is a big time-consuming process. Which are not solved by replacing one variable in the code. Especially when a new game mechanics is introduced, and not just a nerf of some parameter.

The conclusion of a new DLC for the game is a planned process that is extremely difficult to transfer. The financial condition of the game developer's company depends on it. As well as sponsors. And it does not always work out to release everything on time and without problems. We need to wait a bit.

I'll note it again. This is not an excuse for developers. Everyone makes mistakes. I urge you to be more patient. After all, this game gave me emotions and joy more than any other.


Я провел в этой игре уже 1400 часов. И мне есть что рассказать. 

Я правда люблю эту игру. Да бывают моменты когда я не захожу в неё месяц, но она все еще остается моей любимой игрой с 2019 года. Я помню обновление генераторов, после которого все мои корабли сломались, это было больно, но это стало толчком для моего развития. Появилась новая механика, с которой нужно справиться, понять и адаптироваться к ней. 

weaphones DLC  было неоднозначным для меня. С одной стороны комьюнити этого хотело (сколько крафтов было на эту тему в воркшопе). Я же придерживался того, что игра больше про «спасение людей». Но спустя время я проникся им, понял что это просто новая область в которой я могу реализовать свои идеи. Что игра становится более разносторонней.

Industrial  DLC Новый огромный остров. Это по сути все что мне было нужно. Поездами я пока не проникся (кто знает, может этот день близко) Но это обновление привнесло все те же эмоции. Появились новые блоки, новые задания, новые дела которые можно решить по разному. Улучшая каждый раз свои постройки, для достижения максимальной оптимизации. 

И сейчас новое. Space DLC, сказать что оно нужно игре? Да, однозначно. Почему ? Для меня это новый горизонт который можно покорить. Я не сторонник играть на чужих построек. (В воркшопе много безупречных и просто потрясающих построек, куча контроллеров и тд). Мой подход, это придумать что то свое. Да будет не идеальным, но будет повод это улучшить. И я с нетерпением хочу покорить космос и луну. 

Ничего не бывает идеальным, и сейчас повторяется ситуация из 2019 года (вроде тогда это было), когда обновление сломало все у всех. Да больно. Но не ужеле это не повод разобраться в новой механике?

Про баги (Space DLC и не только) Разработка это дело не простое. А разработка игры это тем более не что то простое. Особенно в которой стараются создать физику близкую к реальной. 

Это не оправдание разработчиков, которые допускают баги в игре. Это все же их ошибка и им это разруливать, мы все же заплатили за игру. 

Но будте терпимей, исправление багов это большой трудоемкий процесс. Которые не решается заменой одной переменной в коде. Особенно когда вводится новая механика игры, а не просто нерф какого то параметра. 

Вывод нового DLC к игре, это запланированый процесс, который переносить крайне сложно. От этого зависит финансовое состояние компании разработчика игры. А так же спонсоров. И не всегда получается выпустисть все в срок и без проблем. Нужно немного подождать. 

Еще раз отмечу. Это не оправдание разработчиков. Все совершают ошибки. Я призываю быт более терпеливым. Ведь эта игра подарила мне эмоций и радости больше чем какая либо еще.",1697192788,1697193127,True,1,0,0.479063451290130615,0,True,False,False

The developers have a terrible attitude to adding new updates. Every time major features get added, expect to not play for a couple days until fixes come out. Also expect many vehicles to stop working entirely... it's actually rare to spawn a vehicle that's a couple years old, and see it work correctly. This, by itself, is not such a big issue, but the developers claim they cannot add certain updates because they will break too many vehicles, then proceed to release a different update that does exactly that.

Another major issue is the direction the developers are taking the game into... or lack thereof: the major updates and DLCs are all over the place. I understand that this is no longer the coast guard simulator the game was intended to be at launch, but the earlier expansions made a lot of sense. Larger islands allowed for wheeled vehicles to get more use, forest fires added another (very tense) mission you could do, and so on. Weapons were somewhat fitting: the multiplayer feature, already present in Stormworks, made PvP vehicle combat an extremely enjoyable activity, while the damage system made it so the weapons worked quite well without having to change much at the core of the game. The Arid DLC really just added more land to explore, more railways to play with, and so on. However, even before the Arid DLC launched, there were many updates that just did not fit in.

For example, there were several updates that just added animals. Sure, it makes the world a bit more interesting, but most people I know play with them disabled anyway. Instead of working on improving the multiplayer experience, instead of fixing the countless irritating bugs, instead of pushing a fix for monitors on some AMD GPUs (all they have to do is periodically reset the monitor), instead of fixing the performance and stability issue on Linux since the anti-cheat update released... they added crocodiles. The oil spills they added recently cannot be turned off, even in creative (now called ""custom"") mode, and they create serious issues even after one or two planes get damaged (very common considering the weapons DLC), and require closing the game and opening a brand new world. A simple ""clean oil spills"" button, like the one that already exists for radiation, would solve this.

The new space DLC update is an extreme example of this trend. The Stormworks world is flat, so the developers quite literally had to bend the game to get it to work. The update (whose game-breaking changes appear regardless of whether you buy the DLC or not) also came with sweeping changes to the gas system, breaking planes, ships, et cetera. If you don't own the DLC, you just crash into an invisible wall after reaching a certain altitude. There is also no way to see this wall, so expect to fly around and suddenly explode if you don't own the DLC, or joined someone's world without the DLC enabled. It also does not fit with the theme of the game at all. Imagine if tomorrow, the devs of Kerbal Space Program announced a new DLC that adds fighter jet parts, and a dynamic fighter jet campaign to the game. There have been a ton of space-themed games coming out recently, and Stormworks just shouldn't be one of them. Space gameplay will always feel half-baked, as the game engine cannot handle non-flat planets or a solar system. Meanwhile, many would be extremely happy with a DLC that adds fishing, for example. This update and DLC are just not needed, and do not fit with the game.

It pains me to leave such a negative review on what used to be my favorite game after 6000 hours, but I feel it is necessary. I tried to be positive about the decisions the developers made in the past, but they've just made it more and more difficult as of recent.",1537208913,1697189845,False,2,0,0.526813864707946777,2,True,False,False

Devs bloated it with new feature after new feature, every one of which only 90% working, and then never went back and fixed more than the absolute minimum to avoid hard crashes.

There's many long standing bugs that the community has known about and complained about for literal years, but the devs have refused to fix, either claiming that to do so would break a lot of vehicles that ""relied"" on those bugs to function or just outright refusing to acknowledge them.

And instead, they burned development time on a Space DLC, tested NONE of it, and dumped it on the community. The accompanying update for everyone (including those who don't have Space DLC) then broke around 75%+ of the vehicles on the workshop. Many systems just outright don't even work anymore (such as cooling manifolds, required for engines to not literally catch on fire, not accepting any coolant).

Oh, and Space DLC? apparently it's a disappointment, too. According to the Dev's own Dev Diary, you can't even go around the back of the moon. It's a Space DLC without the Space. One which took all their dev time so they couldn't fix the issues that have been plaguing the game since before its first DLC.

Concept and replay-ability is certainly there - who doesn't like a great building game. Problem is there's so much that's broken from one week to the next, no one can keep up with the developers nose-bleed antics.

Perhaps when it's no longer treated and regarded as an Indie - since they've planned DLC releases already - is when this title will mature; might have to wait a couple of years for the devs to catch up to that maturity model.

Editor is very limiting causing the community to edit game files which the Developers claim can cause performance issues even though no one has even had a drop in performance with edited game files.

The Search And Destroy DLC is very half assed with practical weapons being migraine inducing to build and the included A.I having aimbot level accuracy but no spatial awareness leading to them often colliding with each other and getting stuck and causing ridiculous lag.

The Frontier DLC fell short of expectations due to it only introducing wildlife.


The Developers themselves, they are completely disconnected and not interested in the community which leads to a lot of tone deaf decisions and issues going either ignored or unresolved

As of 7/1/2023, Multiplayer has seen  improvements but latency and input delay is still previlent.

This abomination is an identity crisis put into a ""game""
its trying to be a coast guard, shipping, war, physics sim, builder, tycoon, logistics, sandbox game all at the same time.


Overall, wouldn't recommend getting it unless you have spare money that you just don't care about and the DLCs are just not worth it.

One last issue that isn't with the game itself but the official community Discord sever, It's ran like a dictatorship, any discussion about anything not relating to stormworks is forbidden, speech is highly censored, moderators default to muting every time without any warning prior.

Overall, Stormworks IS a great concept that's held back by bad developers

You can test all you want in staging and development environments, but there's no substitute for testing in production. That's where the real users are, and that's where the real bugs are.

Testing in production helps you to:

Catch bugs that you never would have found in staging or development. This is because staging and development environments are never perfect replicas of production. There are always subtle differences in hardware, software, and configuration.
Improve your software's performance. Testing in production helps you to identify performance bottlenecks and other issues that can impact your users' experience.
Reduce the risk of outages and downtime. By catching bugs early and addressing performance issues, you can reduce the risk of your software going down.
Improve your users' satisfaction. By delivering a reliable and bug-free product, you can keep your users happy and coming back for more.
Of course, testing in production is not without its risks. You need to be careful not to impact your users' experience, and you need to have a plan in place for handling bugs and outages.

But the benefits of testing in production far outweigh the risks. If you're not already testing in production, you should start today.

I completely understand why there is so much frustration and anger directed towards the devs.
Unfortunately they never seem to understand why the community backlash happens with updates and DLC releases.

My own opinion is it's because Geometa refuses to directly interact with the Stormworks Community. They hide behind the motto of ""giving the community the tools"" to allow them to interact with each other as a self-supported community.
I think this is wrong, and it makes things worse.

I'm aware that the community of course will always be unhappy with some aspect of an update or change. However, I believe it amplifies all the negative knee-jerk responses simply because Deltar and Geometa literally hides from direct community interaction.

For example, Instead of coming out today with the release and doing a live stream explaining what changes were made, why changes were made and why they believe the changes made are for the better of the game - they dump massive changes and a dlc for the game and runaway.

This behavior is not new and Deltars has done interviews where he states that they intentionally stay away from interacting and acknowledging the community and it's various groups and members. (Roughly - the idea is a community that supports itself)

Of course they send out keys to content creators with numbers to boost Geometa's sales and maybe once in awhile drop a name in a Friday update as long as said name is a cheerleader, but for the most part speaking with and talking to the ""actual"" community is something Deltars and Geometa avoids outright.

Currently there was some talk they are working on a hotfix(s) for today's DLC and Game Update. Something that really shouldn't be needed if the game was actually tested.

And when I say tested i mean tested with community builders that have countless hours interacting with the game systems. Instead I believe the game was internally ""tested"" which I'm guessing revolves around implementing a feature and ""testing"" if it works as intended and not testing the game as a whole. I don't think they actually test changes by interacting with various builds and then communicating how the update is/will impact previous workshop content directly to the community.

And of course as mentioned above - even if this were to occur, Deltars and Geometa does not interact with the community. Communicate directly with the community and walk us thru changes and how they may impact older builds and more importantly - why builds may have issues and how to approach the new changes and possibly update older builds.

Instead as stated above - they drop giant changes and runaway leaving the community to do quality assurance and try to support each other without a clear understanding of the ""why"" and ""whats"" of the update.

Anyway, in short, the bottom line is they need to stop hiding from the community and directly communicate with community and i don't mean fluff PR Friday update text copies. No other Dev at this level would behave this way with a community that truly cares about the game,..

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME


Ok, look, I'm going to be honest here. the game is a dumpster fire. the game is constantly half broken, the devs do little to no bugfixes, and treat the community like trash. if you want to play it, don't buy it, go pirate it. really. I am ENCOURAGING YOU to do so. Just so you can see how broken of a game it is. Plus, now they are adding guns as a PAID DLC. Meaning I'm going to be paying EVEN MORE MONEY into an already BROKEN GAME. If you want to play this burning dumpster fire of a game that should have never left Early Access, by my guest, this is just a review. But don't say that the reviews you read were all really positive.

Shit, with the nearly 200 extra hours I've put in since I initialy posted this review, I only keep playing because this is one of the only games of it's kind

Many hours later, this all still applies.

The new update broke literally everything, and to make matters worse, the DLC is terrible.
The Space DLC has added barely anything, yeah space is cool and all, but like, why? in the first place it's not needed, and continuosly adding content to a game missing features that the community wants, means more work down the line when they do eventually (Maybe) add the feature.

the DLC adds nothing, and once again, $14.50 AUD, ridiculous price, you're literally paying them to break the game.

don't buy this game until they actually do what people are paying them to do.

[b] stay away from these greedy developers. [/b]


As fun and amazing as I do find this game, the developers are almost as greedy as Triple A developers.

As of writing this review, there is 2 paid DLC with a third on the way, with the base game costing $36 AUD, and both DLC's subsequently costing $15, that's already $66, it's ridiculous, with third DLC in mind, assuming it costs the same:

[h1][b] THAT'S $81 AUD [/b][/h1]

This kind of monetisation is seriously just corporate greed, and sadly, both DLC's don't even add THAT much to the game, it's a fun thing to get on, take a look and then just not care, it's not worth it and seriously is unfair to people who support this game, why not make the DLC's free? hell, at least make them cheaper, I've never run across a game made by a small company that tries to rob you blind as much as this game.

the base game itself has it's charm, but as all sandboxes do, it gets boring quick unless you keep shoving down different builds and what not down your throat, it's a good game, but my god are these developers greedy.

if you're gonna buy this game, keep in mind it's not just the base price, it's also the DLC's, that way you can play the game ""as intended"".",1696652783,1697166046,False,3,0,0.458015263080596924,0,True,False,False

I understand peoples frustration and anger towards the devs. I hate what they have done to this game. The community was one of the highlights for this game, but now it is the only one.

1. Give an honest review of the game, not some bullshit like bad game. Outline what you think is wrong. Make it known why you are doing this
2. Inform others of the situation going on
3. (if you can) refund the DLC
4. Stop playing the game entirely 

I personally just did 1 and will be doing 4. It hurts to right a review like this, but it is in the hope of a better future of the game. As previously stated i will no longer play this game. 

One final message
Please do not threaten the devs, violence is not the only answer. Change can take time, but that doesn't mean we should already plan for harm. Be patient, but don't just standby. Be the change, be the better person, and be the better future for stormworks.

but this time, this most recent update, along with a DLC release, has killed the game, boats no longer work, you know, one of the most important things in this game, jet engines are screwed and will stall out after 200 meters. but sure, space works.

Despite being ""1.0"" some of the most basic things are broken, unfinished, unbalanced, and desperately needing polish. It crashes at seaming random times doing random things. The constant dealing with bugs and non-working features. And yet the Devs want to add more things that will most likely brake whats not already broken. The discussion of adding weapons, and nuclear reactors to search and rescue game is too ridiculous, the whole transportation theme is a bit of a stretch, but makes some sense, life can't all be rescuing someone. The integration of transportation of bulk fluids and containers is not too far off from the original setting. But why must every game include weapons, and really, nuclear reactors, really? I can think of a couple of reasons why that is ridiculous. 

First, ships rarely go over the size where nuclear power is a better alternative to jet or diesel. Second the reactors are either going to be massive to even resemble their real world counterparts or be small enough that there is going to be no reason not to put a reactor in a ship. One of the major reasons why nuclear reactors are used is for their ability to go for seemingly forever on very little fuel, and thus subs and aircraft carriers have one less thing to worry about in a situation where the supply chain is in question or have to be away from port for extended periods, other than that there is not great reasons to go nuclear, especially in Stormworks where fuel is not in short supply nor in scarce locations. The only way for that to work out is the adding of long range missions which might get boring after pointing in a direction for hours on end.

And ""Vehicle Weapons"", there are a plethora of block/voxel based games with weapons built in from the start why not go play those for f***s sake. From The Depths, Space engineers or Robocraft and the list goes on and on. Theses are games built with the promise for weapons and destruction and combat. How are you going to connect laser guided rockets, ship mounted artillery pieces, and high powered machine guns to a search and rescue game? Yes the whole train aspect is really pushing it but its not incredibly out of the scope of the games premise. 

""Why not just not use the weapons when they add them? Its your choice to use them or not.""

Because this game is already in need of bug fixes and patches, re-balancing and other things, and the adding of guns and such is going to drive away the people that will stay around. The ones calling for guns will just jump to the next game that lets them build their own tanks, planes or whatever-else.

The closest thing to a connection I can think of for weapons is the Coast Guard, but they have no need for giant and devastating weapons, because they mostly have to use them on smugglers and I cant think of any smugglers with a standing navy. And what use would weapons have in the campaign? Would the Devs add in enemy AI to fight? Enemy tanks, planes, and boats that you would have to destroy for a mission? At that point just go play a game that is built around combat, not one that will have had it shoehorned in to appease the vocal minority that joined in the discord. 

I would wager that if the Devs ran a poll inside the game so that every person that played it saw it rather than the many who knew about the discord, the few who cared to join it, and the fewer that payed attention to it, and the even fewer that actively interacted on there. There would be a good difference in the results.

1st EDIT: So i bought the Weapon DLC just to give the devs a second chance, I thought maybe with releasing a whole weapons DLC they would have tried to iron out some of the most basic bugs plaguing this game. The game just crashed after I pressed ctrl+z. That is such a basic operation, I may not know the ins and outs of game development but how does a bug like that even make it out of the beta? Mirror mode I assume has something to do with it, but that is such a basic feature, how after all this time, after the 1.0 update, after the weapons DLC, does something like that even still exist? I get that this DLC just released today and the ""day one patch"" but this is just embarrassing.

2nd EDIT: I decided to do an experiment and see how many game crashing bugs I could find. To be clear I was not looking for bugs I was just building and playing like a normal player would and on average I could not go for more than an hour or so before a game crashing bug, this is beyond embarrassing this is almost neglect, how in hell did this pass Q&A testing. How did no one catch any of this? And the piss poor optimization is outstanding.

---Detailed Review---

It should be clear by now that I think this game is exquisite and a must have. However, while I am a relatively new player, it is hard to disagree with older players that the dev's progress, despite releaseing numerous and consistent updates, seems glacial. Some touted features, such as the supposed procedural generation of the islands, are simply lies at this point. Yes, your starting island, depending on whether you choose and island or mainland option, will vary in position around the mainland. However, this will be at a relatively consistent distance and like a clock will be either 11, 4, 1 or another other clock-like positioning, but otherwise is the same, leading to a functionally static map. Similarly, the arctic mainzone, the mainland and the connecting railway, plus the diving atoll are essentially static. I understand that such complexity is hard to procedurally generate, but it has and can be done, and in a game such as this, with no story, it is quite important that map variability feature prominently. Similarly, missions, though recently expanded and augmented by mods, tend to be repetative and stale. They should be more complex (toggelable) and have some kind of randomisation factor. Landing, putting out a fire and transporting casualties is a formula that can become very dull over extended periods.

Additionally, the tendency of the devs to introduce updates that break existing vehicles can be frustrating and lead to irritation and creator brain drain. Though, I appreciate the physics complexity at play. What the devs cannot be faulted for is how hard it is to build, as some of us manage truly breathtaking designs. In this vein, it is the community that makes the game what it is. It is supportive, creative and gifted. 

Aside from these limited issues, this game is a jewel and can take hours of your life. I would buy it, especially so if on sale, and let your inner sailor, pilot, engineer and soldier (if you get the DLC [also recommended]) loose.",1659466055,1697142955,False,1,0,0,9,True,False,False

then i got into the actual game. it was fun. i got to build shitty cars which i was proud of, then i built my first plane, and that was pretty god damn awesome too since i actually got to see the world from above for the first time on my own plane.
then, here, two years later and 2.6k hours into the game i've got some shit that im really proud of myself for building, ofcourse with some failures here and there. i enjoyed the game despite the bugs and whatnot. i just built, experimented, fucked around with friends and that ofcourse was fun, again, despite the bugs and glitches.
but the constant fucking neglect the devs display towards the game and its community is just insanely insulting, it honestly quite saddens me to see that the game was in such a better state two years ago when dlc wasnt even a consideration.
there are things i want to build, things i still need to finish, but i wont. why? because the fucking space DLC, just like every major update, breaks fucking everything. 
remember the oil update? yeah, that one is still fucking broken. you cant clean the oil. you explode a cessna 172 5 million km away from the center of the map with half a tank of fuel? yeah, the entire play area turns black.
why? because fuck you. 
the devs just throw constant hostility towards any criticism and actual suggestions or bug fixes, which are always met with a ""mark as duplicate"" on the bug tracker and then completely shoved under the rug and left there to rot, never being added.
the community isnt doing much to force a change either, some people are trying to get the devs to fix it but that wont happen with this little people.

While Stormwork's building mechanics are great, it's gameplay leaves more than a little to be desired, especially if you don't buy the Weapons DLC. Jobs are repetitive, have no sense of achievement and have minimal in-game reward. The only time I've had fun in StormWorks is when building random vehicles and comparing those vehicles with friends. You can't treat StormWorks than anything more than a sandbox game with no objective because it has none.

If you do play Stormworks as a sandbox, you will find it incredibly frustrating at first, as the learning curve is non-existent. There are some video tutorials you can watch, but they teach you the surface-level basics of the game. If you understand and watch these tutorials, then the game can be fun for you. The design process for vehicles is fun. The logic is not fun. If you progress to the stage where you start doing complicated logic, the game gets progressively less fun as the game has no way to debug microcontrollers and logic.

If you want to play this game and design basic vehicles, go for it, you'll have fun. Wanna do anything else? It's gonna be repetitive, not that rewarding and difficult.

Recently dedicated server hosting has become difficult and servers are starting to die because of that. Some server owners/hosters such as myself have become demotivated and tired as a result of these updates.
There was one time where I contacted a developer about several people using cheats in the game and I got a response which was good however with the recent update making servers crash or have a memory leak I have not received any response to. (and I'm not sure if they fixed that or not)

I enjoy this game for its freedoms with logic, mechanics and building (with or without XML) and I love it for its ability to utilise scripts for vehicles or servers which no other game does to the same simplicity stormworks does.

Multiplayer is such a fundamental part of stormworks but the TPS being so low and Input delay (for example: +1000f) it kills the game so much.

It is such a shame that this game is starting to die and the communities are starting to become less active.
On My server, D&A and so many more.

I hope the devs will focus on fixing the game and ironing out its imperfections instead of adding more features which only make it more unplayable and features that we just do not need or ask for.

I hope this new game I heard that the Geometa devs are working on is like stormworks but much better in terms of performance.

I used to call it the game i had always wanted as a kid, a vehicle building sandbox with almost endless possibilities. Through this game i have improved at both designing and programming, and my life would probably be very different if i had never found it, for better and for worse. anyway sentimental crap out the way this game means (or meant) a lot to me. 

yeah okay the stuff:
the devs do tend to mismanage the game at times. I used to have Patience for this and would usually just enjoy the aspects of the game that i could. Incredibly annoying unremovable oil spills dont stop me from making boats (i love making boats). HOWEVER, the recently released update/dlc combo, which has broken both buoyancy, and the exploits necessary to overcome it, is testing this Patience. To have the SAR aspect of a game (a game mainly marketed as Search And Rescue) be almost completely wiped out by an update that has supposedly been in the works for years, doesnt exactly leave a good taste in the mouth. I bought and still play this game to make silly boats that i can drive with my friends, but now i cant do that anymore. 

I, personally, was hoping the pressure changes would make creations a bit more interesting, and to a degree was willing to cope with some broken creations to pay for it. Unfortunately a boat needs to be able to float to make use of these new features. Which is a bit hard to do now. I was willing to accept a space DLC (very unfitting for the base game theme, and also hard to implement in a smooth way), but not at the cost at which it came. And its not like its easy to go back to a previous version either, something which should really be standard for gamechanging updates like this. 

Even if this is fixed, you cant patch broken trust. 

Leaving a negative review on this hurts. I cant recommend this game i love (or used to love) because of the incredible lack of care the developers show towards the core community. I would be WAY more pissed about this if my ridiculous hour count hadnt given me some real life skills, but to have one of my main creative outlets be spat on like this, managed in a way where cant keep playing, doesnt reflect the developers attitude towards community well.

2nd Review (January 2022) [Negative]: Look the game itself is decent, there are numerous bugs that are present that have been for the game's 4 year lifespan but they aren't that problematic for general game play.

If you want this for multi-player i would say just don't bother, unless you are playing with one other person and can afford to pay for a dedicated server/have a spare computer.

What is problematic is the Dev Team's numerous bad decisions. First off they ignore community feedback, both that which is done through their official discord, in which they hide themselves among thousands of people without roles to avoid attention and criticism.

Next they recently introduced two game breaking bugs, firstly they made it so steam power is so efficient that almost any boiler will explode, making it so any steam propelled creation will no longer work, the other was a Microcontroller CoM calculation error which through off the weight of pretty much every creation. And another issue was they ""fixed"" a collission hitbox that was missing for over a year which ruined pretty much every ground vehicle on the workshop. Now this was fixed, but not before the weekend had passed, which meant many could not play properly, an acceptable timescale for an Early Access title, not for a Fully Released game.

Since the Weapons DLC there was a feature request on there official bug tracker which they have since ignored which would vastly improve the DLC, and another issue was made by one of their Admins criticising the games development and lack of community interaction, also subsequently ignored.

This was followed with a petition with a lot of support being made by said admin for a volunteer community manager position to be made to open up the lines of communication between the developers and the community, which would also involve criticism of updates and suggestions to improve the game.

Like an official group of testers and experts before, this was ignored and the admin was removed from his role.

I think this video sums up the game's development process: https://youtu.be/zjedLeVGcfE

3rd Review (May 2022) [Mixed]: Another 800hrs since my January Review, would I reccommend it? Still no, the devs have to their credit done a good number of bugfixes since January, which has made MP useable and even fun sometimes. However, the game still suffers from major issues listed above.

4th Review (June 2022) [Very Negative]: Another 91 hours and the new ""Underwater Update"" where most of the content, what little their even is, is on the Surface. The new parts look utter dogwater, seriously no effort on them at all, and the devs broke floating point precision, effecting everything from radars, sonars, axis sensitivity inputs, shadows, and even the game's camera, the issue gets compounded even worse as you get further away from the centre of the map. They still don't test their updates.

5th Review (December 2022) [Very Negative]: The devs deleted the game with an update and claim they test their game. Any suggestion that they improve quality control is met with silence, or gaslighting

6th Review (October 2023) [Very Very Negative]: The game is now completely broken. Jet Engines don't work over 200m altitude, fuel is more dense than water so any ship sinks, among everything else.",1628893663,1697132734,False,5,0,0.547867774963378906,0,True,False,False

Update(July 5th, 20):
There has been an update about adding items that you can equip that has been talked about for some time. The devs have talked about it with like 4 or 5 ""News"" updates about how it's an upcoming update... Now normally there is not much of a problem, just that the update is taking a while. I get it if they want to hype it up to get more people to play the game, but there is a suggestion that would fix this. ADD MOD SUPPORT! If there was mod support to make custom blocks, than so much energy could be put on the community. Does someone want a block that is not avalible in the standard game? Add support so that they can add the block themself. I'm not trying to hate on the game, I think the game is amazing! I just think that the updates should be handled better(?) I don't know, I'm not a game developer... 
Some suggestions for the developers:
  -Mod support...
  -Items
    -A fluid/fire hose/better handling for connectors
    -(I'm not sure if it's what I saw, but if not...) A hand-held controller to control mechanisms remotely over radio or other

I will probobly update this list later on....

For example, a very common and noticeable issue is the terrible multiplayer experience. The devs announce updates ""fixing"" the issues, but the improvement is only marginal. Large craft or vehicles that are completely broken/are glitching cause your physics to slow down tremendously, making the game unplayable. The game also crashes often and every time it crashes it starts in a ""safe resolution"" (windowed 720p). My hardware shouldn't be an issue at all, I have a Ryzen 5 2600 and RTX 3070.
The game is generally unplayable now, with an unoptimised physics engine and poor user interface. Selecting what addons you want to use is hard, and loading craft larger than the workbench size requires you to load it as a mission. You best have one ready before you create the world, because you can only have one custom mission (from in-game) spawned in at a time.
The workbench has it's own issues too, for example its hard to scroll through workshop creations when the game is already lagging, and trying to take a look at a vehicle's logic when it has more than a couple hundred nodes is difficult.
Overall, I've started to play this game less since other games have started to become more entertaining than this power hungry pile of junk. I might play more if the devs manage to actually fix their physics engine.

-Multiplayer latency (Multiplayer is unstable and doesn't allow for reasonable game play users can be on the same network and still have tons of delay)
-Vehicle buoyancy needs to be fixed a large number of vessels no longer can float because the devs have changed the calculations. Ships are too heavy now.
-The Air is soup. Aircraft that once flew at reasonable speeds now cant achieve anywhere near their original speeds pre dlc. to the point where a prop aircraft at 1000meters up looses 50% of its speed. This makes no sense

The game is supposedly meant to be one that everyone can play, but some aspects of building vehicles require the player to know algebra, a type of math that most people only learn in high school/secondary school, and some other aspects require the player to know the Lua programming language. There have also been many updates and a couple of DLCs that have brought pointless and half-baked game content instead of fixes for things that have been broken for years. Multiplayer gameplay is a laggy mess if you aren't within 1,000km of the host server, and/or if you don't have a ping of less than 100ms to the host server. Also, the game only uses one CPU core despite all modern CPUs having at least 4 cores, which only increases the lag problems.

The game is also quite slow sometimes since it mostly runs of 1 CPU core but the creators cant to much about that. And i abosolutly hate the NPC following AI it's sometimes so terrible.

    When I first bought this game I was enamored by the depth of the building and logic system and it seemed like I found out something new with every passing hour I played. Before I knew it, I had spent my entire weekend from dawn till dusk playing this game. And now every time I boot this game back up im struck with another ray of inspiration and a feverish drive to bring a new creation to life, twice as good as the last one.
 The game also, while simplistic has a nice aesthetic to it that is much easier on the eyes than similar games I've played like From The Depths.
 After playing the career for some time the core gameplay is also very solid, giving some kind of reason to use your vehicle which many other voxel building games (*cough cough* Space Engineers *cough cough*) fail to implement, hoping to succeed solely on the statement of ""YoU cAn Do AnYtHiNg"" However its not quite as fleshed out as I would like it to be...

The Bad:

    While there is what I consider to be a bare minimum of variety in the missions depending on where you go, progression doesn't feel very real after the first 10 hours or so. You do some missions, grab some boxes and then boom you have enough money to buy a new piece of property and the ability to make pretty much anything you want with it. In addition to this, doing the missions feels pointless. There are no NPC interactions of any kind. You just randomly get assigned missions after a certain amount of time based on where you are and in my opinion this makes things feel pretty aimless. Also the two DLC's currently available seem to add very little to the game in my opinion. I don't know if I was just encountering lag or a bug of some kind but after buying the search and destroy DLC, I decided to do a fly-by of an enemy base to test out the damage system. But unfortunately despite me flying a very slow prop plane, the enemy AI was not able to hit me even once. Even after I got out and stood still right in front of an enemy vehicle it was unable to hit my character.

My Suggestion:

    Stormworks team, please consider adding the following if it lines up with your vision:

 1. Introduce a reputation system.

    What I would feel would help greatly is a way to build reputation with different organizations to get better missions. Imagine a menu accessible through a radio for example, that would allow you to track your reputation with different companies and accept increasingly difficult missions as you increase your standing. Potentially even having a large scale and very difficult but very profitable mission that would be available once you maxed out your reputation with each company. This would create a very tangible feeling of progression in the career mode that I think could help with motivation to play greatly.

 2. Replace boxes with items, and make it less lucrative / more rare.

    I find the boxes to strip a lot of motivation to play the game in my opinion, since you can easily make 2 or 3 times as much money as would from your average mission and with far less time investment. In the career mode, I've probably made about 70% of my money just from grabbing boxes I find in between missions. What I suggest is 1: Making the system more interesting by swapping out the crates for different valuable items such as a floating note in a bottle that could trigger a mission, or some jewelry found on the sea floor that you need to sell to a merchant. And 2: Making the items you find far less valuable than the illustrious potential $10k you can get from a single box. Adding these things would make missions far more financially viable while also maintaining the bit of extra cash you can get to cover fuel costs or slightly accelerate progression.

 3. Make research an actual system

    When I first tried my hand at playing the game outside of the sandbox, I was intending on playing with the research system but it ended up just feeling like meaningless grind and waiting. I feel that If you made purchasable properties that had research stations that you needed to deliver increasingly difficult to handle supplies to in order to unlock new technologies, it would feel much more like an gameplay loop. Also having an easy to read tech tree similar to something like Kerbal Space Program, would make it a lot more approachable and easier to pin down what to research first. And finally, please get rid of the research timers. 45 minutes minimum to research anything is rediculous. This research overhaul I feel would also make it much easier for new players to slowly acclimate to everything the game has to offer.

Closing Remarks:

    This game is such a shining gem, but I really want to see it break free of the trope that plagues all other building games in which an incredible building system is presented, but no good reason to use your glorious creations. Please consider my suggestions, I feel that most will agree that they would be a massive improvement to an already marvelous game.

Where there was once major updates, there is now DLCs which promise the world but add nothing of substance. You might get the impression upon viewing this game that it is a search and rescue game, but the core search and rescue gameplay loop is poorly designed and is not the devs focus, they are more concerned about ensuring there is a constant stream of poorly thought out content so that content creators can shovel the 20th ship sinking video out to their audiences, which is essentially the major thing driving sales. What is possibly the most disappointing of all is how little the devs care about their players, as with every update they use screenshots of user created vehicles which they do not ask for permission to use nor credit the creators.

tl;dr: The game is a buggy mess constantly getting half baked features shovelled onto the top of it, and the devs don't care about the community.",1696709049,1696709049,False,4,0,0.52911674976348877,0,True,False,False

I like to play this game, but it is just impossible. The devs of this game are just ignoring users and adding useless features like ""oil spill"" instead of trying to optimalize stuff.
For me, this game concept is amazing and has a lot of potential, its just that this studio is not the right group of people to develop this game, they are not listening to the community and add updates that break stuff even further.

""Stormworks: Build and Rescue"" is an exhilarating and highly creative sandbox game that invites players to design, build, and operate a variety of vehicles to tackle challenging missions. Developed by Sunfire Software and published by Green Man Gaming Publishing, this title offers a unique blend of engineering, exploration, and rescue operations that will captivate both budding engineers and thrill-seekers.

At its core, ""Stormworks"" empowers players to let their imaginations run wild as they construct vehicles from the ground up. Whether you're building a rescue helicopter, a speedy boat, or a versatile submarine, the game's robust building mechanics and extensive library of parts allow for endless customization. The sense of achievement when your creation takes shape and successfully navigates the game's dynamic and ever-changing environment is incredibly rewarding.

The game's missions provide both structure and excitement to your engineering endeavors. From daring sea rescues to thrilling firefighting operations, ""Stormworks"" challenges your problem-solving skills and your ability to adapt to rapidly evolving situations. The variety of missions ensures that gameplay remains engaging, and the procedural generation of the world and weather adds an extra layer of unpredictability.

""Stormworks"" shines in its attention to detail, particularly in its physics and weather systems. The dynamic weather patterns, complete with thunderstorms, high waves, and fog, can turn a routine mission into a nail-biting adventure. The physics engine adds realism to vehicle handling, making it a joy for those who appreciate the technical aspects of simulation games.

The game's multiplayer mode is a fantastic addition, allowing friends to collaborate on building and operating vehicles. Co-op play enhances the experience and enables players to tackle missions as a well-coordinated team.

However, ""Stormworks"" does come with a bit of a learning curve, especially for players new to engineering or simulation games. Building and operating vehicles can be complex, and it may take some time to become proficient. Additionally, the game's user interface could be more intuitive, making it easier for players to access information and controls.

In conclusion, ""Stormworks: Build and Rescue"" offers a captivating blend of creativity and challenge that will appeal to a wide range of players. Whether you're a simulation enthusiast, an aspiring engineer, or simply looking for a game that encourages creativity and problem-solving, ""Stormworks"" has something to offer. While it may require some patience to master, the sense of accomplishment and the thrilling missions make it well worth the investment of your time. Strap in and prepare for a maritime adventure like no other.",1610955316,1696525409,True,0,0,0.481744438409805298,1,True,False,False

They add minor updates every week, and major updates every month or so, I'm sure custom windows are somewhere down the pipeline. Anyway, I would totally recommend this game.

October 2021 Update.  Well...no need to sugar coat this.  Think long and hard before you buy this game.  It is much different than the pre Version 1.0 release.  The new weapons DLC is, in my opinion, disappointing.  And isn't worth it's price.  Updates are always being pushed.  Which typically is a good thing.  But the updates often break things in the game.  Sometimes rendering entire builds useless.  Builds you may spend hours building.  That is extremely frustrating.  You will need a hefty CPU to run this game smoothly.  And multiplayer....HA!  Good luck.  Multiplayer is horrible.   Nearly unplayable.   After nearly 1500hrs playing this game from pre-1.0 to now I can say I am disappointed at best.  Angry at worse.  This game does have a lot of potential.  The concept at least.  But with the current team of Dev's I don't see it getting any better.  I truly see it become less and less playable with every update.  Until a major optimization update I personally would stay away from this game.  You will get it, build some basic stuff, enjoy it a lot and then you will get better at building more complex stuff.  And then, the lag monster will arise and you will begin the slide down the slippery slope of frustration.  

I dislike writing all of this.  I really do.  And I will still play it.  Even after this rant of a review.  But with each play I get closer and closer to stopping playing all together.  It is a true bummer.  Of course, this is just my own opinion.  People will disagree with me.  People will become very defensive and say I have no idea what I am talking about.  And that is totally cool.  Everybody has their own opinion and I appreciate that.  However, there will be people that agree with me 100%.  I suggest you watch some youtube.  Check out MrNjersey for great tutorials and highlights of what this game is about.  Keep in mind he has a very high end PC.  Then go watch Endoskull.  He highlights flaws in the game.  He also has a high end PC.  Watch others as well.  Educate yourself before spending a dime on this game.

(yes i'm that old) The triangle on the screen you had to type instructions to make it draw lines...GOTO and such?  I never made circles.  Just straight lines across the screen BECAUSE IT WAS EASY.

Why is almost every game made since the invention of MINECRAFT following this disgusting game design model??
Why, if you are trying to make a graphical pleasing to the eye game, that has mechanics that allow you to build vehicles, with the intricacies of how they need to work, would you model your game off of the early years of Microsoft Flight sim (1-5 at least)??

This idea that games should follow this simple rule : [Lego's rule], baffles me.  I loved playing legos when i was young.  Now, I would like to play games that are immersive; suck me in to the environment.  It doesn't have to be realistic.  If that was the case I'd go outside.

And then I realize, the graphics are this simple, because of the budget needed to fix the game they already released...

Multiplayer is a joke.  I have a 4090, 24 GB Ram, 13900K w/32 GB of RAM, and this game slows to BS speed (1-4 frames a second), when someone spawns a ship, and it makes me wonder about my computer when someone spawns a ship that ""has too many lights""?  Stutter central.  The game runs great when there are no vehicles on the screen;

getting frustrated when the mechanics of the game breaks:  ""This switch literally worked not 1 minute ago when I touched it , now it doesn't even move, and when it does...nothing.""

And don't get me started about the godforsaken MAP. (actually lets start:) Why can't I see my teammates when I'm zoomed out on the map, instead of spending 3 minutes at really close zoom and needing to scroll around??...not that hard to fix.

I don't think I would play this game single player, so this review isn't about that.  It's how you may play it with friends, and the expectations of a decent game to play for a few hours and relax.

NOPE.

The popularity of these ""voxel"" graphics and retro style games doesn't fall deaf on me.  I have enjoyed a few. But, if the game developers think this game suits or warrants more money, through an expansion or DLCs, they better make damn sure the base game works first.  Pile on crap on top of crap hoping that it's not crap doesn't make people, that aren't really attracted to this style of game play, pay money to play the game. (and it's not even close to being there.)

(And they proved it when they said their game isn't based on a sphere, its based on flat land. So good luck on that space thing.  More Lego's anyone?)",1695739380,1695740553,False,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

Came back to find my rescue simulator now has weapon DLC's and a nearly useless industrial DLC
None of the bugs were fixed, swimming and jumping into your boat is still clunky, multiplayer servers are still poorly optimized and will lag when one or more large vehicles are spawned at once, regardless of your own ping or system specs, rescue NPC's will still gladly sit on their boat while it's on fire instead of hopping into the water with a buoy or life vest. The singleplayer still has no progressive story or career, just procedural generated missions that come and go.
Did I mention they're adding a space dlc, while the majority of the game is still in this state?
The developers need to rename the game at this point, as it seems they have split into several other directions, using the base game as a sandbox.

The games controls overall feel decent at most, but I feel like the main selling point of the game is the fact that it's open world, with almost limitless building possibilities, at least if you know how to build. There is a fairly big learning curve, so unless you do have patience for building and essentially programming things, it MIGHT not be the game for you. You can still mess with vehicles the community has made, which there is a lot of, and usually they are fun to play around with. There are also plenty of fairly well made tutorials that are up to date with logic micro controllers and everything so yeah. I'd give the game an overall 7-8/10.

One more thing, the multiplayer. In It's current state, It's very laggy for the person that Isn't hosting in general and especially if you spawn big creations, or of course spawn 1000 krakens (which is pretty funny btw ngl). But yeah it can be almost unplayable in multiplayer sometimes even when not spawning anything big in. Again this is the current state of the game, hopefully they fix it up in the future because if so it'd give a bit more replayability.",1584774692,1695359934,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

For example making a wind turbine generator is pretty much impossible without doing some weird hacks.

Its a great game honestly, but I have spent so many hours making something that ultimately fails that would completely work in real life with 0 issues. It would even work in other games. The physics are so weird in this game it has a lot of oversights and quirks

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

""Stormworks"" is a game that has captured the hearts and imaginations of gamers worldwide, and with the addition of the Weapons DLC, it has become an even more compelling and exhilarating experience. As a passionate player myself, I can't help but sing praises for this phenomenal sandbox game.

""Stormworks"" is a game that seamlessly blends the excitement of engineering and exploration into one captivating package. Players are given the keys to their own customizable vehicles, ranging from helicopters and airplanes to boats and submarines. The freedom to design and build your own creations is not only satisfying but also educational, as it fosters creativity and problem-solving skills.

What sets ""Stormworks"" apart is its dynamic and unforgiving weather system, which adds an incredible layer of realism and challenge to the gameplay. Navigating through raging storms and treacherous waters is both thrilling and nerve-wracking. This game truly shines when it comes to simulating the unpredictable forces of nature.

The Weapons DLC takes the already immersive experience of ""Stormworks"" to a whole new level. It introduces a wide array of weapons and defensive systems, allowing players to engage in intense naval battles and aerial dogfights. Whether you're patrolling the open seas as a coast guard or engaging in high-stakes combat scenarios, the Weapons DLC injects a shot of adrenaline into the game's veins.

What players appreciate most about ""Stormworks"" is the community-driven nature of the game. The Steam Workshop is a treasure trove of player-created vehicles, missions, and mods, expanding the game's content infinitely. This vibrant modding community ensures that there's always something new to explore and experience, making every gameplay session feel fresh and exciting.

One of the most significant achievements of ""Stormworks"" is its commitment to realism. From the detailed vehicle systems and physics to the convincing weather effects and complex engineering aspects, the game truly makes you feel like a skilled engineer battling the elements.

In conclusion, ""Stormworks"" is a masterpiece of a game, and the Weapons DLC enhances it even further, catering to players who crave action-packed adventures on the high seas. The game's emphasis on creativity, realism, and community-driven content makes it a must-play for anyone seeking a unique and engaging gaming experience. If you haven't tried it yet, do yourself a favor and embark on a thrilling journey with ""Stormworks."" It's a five-star adventure you won't soon forget.",1695062320,1695062320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is turning into a block builder and completely forgetting the SEARCH AND RESCUE part entirely. Wooh, Space DLC, just like the real Coast Guard… space. Not to mention the DLC’s in this game are overpriced, for what… a $10 dog? Oh and did I forget to mention the bugs and how the devs don’t care? Well you’d be shocked to find out that’s entirely true! From over simulated 1x1 physics, or to the lack of physics in everything else… the games code is outdated, and for what it wants to do, vs what it can do… are two entirely different categories that don’t work together… plus the lack of attention to the actual game from the devs just makes it worse.
It’s a fun game if: 
-	Your looking to build random builds
Its not a fun game when:
-	Everything is lagging, not like in frames but in delay between clients + simulation caps.
-	90% of time is building or towing a boat 900km
-	The game says Search and Rescue, when really if you want to do that you have to do that with friends… and find them…
-	Bugs everywhere
-	Bugs
-	Did I mention bugs?
-	Oh and features no one asked for
-	Oh and removing or capping features we did ask for…

The graphics are great to look at, yet they have their own flavor. The game also has flood physics, in case you're interested in that.
Now, here's where the problems start.
This game is a laggy mess. To run it, smoothly, at 40 FPS, without changing resolution, you'll need a VERY good PC. The optimization is a nightmare. Sometimes the game has low FPS, sometimes the movement feels like you're on the moon, etc etc.
My only other complaint is that the building plots are relatively small but that's just personal preference.
I've tried, time and again, to come back to this game. The concept is great, but the execution could be better. It can be enjoyable, but if you have a normal PC, you will most likely struggle to run this game.

The game preforms poorly and continues to get worse after every off topic DLC regardless of if you buy them or not. Its so close to being a decent game but I find the career gameplay useless. You cannot effectively make progress due to the way the physics fails. The fact there is basically no way to complete a mission that isn't endlessly tedious due to the need to be so far from the target to prevent the possibility you sink both vessels out of fear of the terribly implemented collision physics. The Devs appear to have no real intent on fixing these issues in place of making useless DLCs and has in turn made a very good vehicle builder with no real reason to actually build the vehicles.

I love this game... as much as I hate it.
With over 1K hours I can't really say ""no, I don't recommend it"", including DLC I'm at close to $0.03/h.  This game has allowed me to build so much that would either never function in similar games, or would have needed to be far simpler in both design and functionality.  The nearly endless options always leave me with something more to do and keep me coming back.

However...
Every time I come back I am promptly reminded of how excessively difficult basic tasks can be, how unintuitive and terrible the builder (in a building game) actually is, and just how much will power it can take to continue a build to the end.  Not to mention it could be very well argued that in several ways notepad.exe is a more advanced tool than the ingame builder... for example:  If you save a file in notepad and then hit close, it closes.  If you save a build in Stormworks and then hit new, it reminds you that doing so will cause you to lose all unsaved progress, as it doesn't recognize you've made no changes since your last save.  Don't even get me started on copy/paste.


PROS:

Building game with consistent updates and new content.
 - This is wonderful as it avoids stagnation, brings players back, and since it's often DLC it helps fund the devs.

Lua scripting
 - I feel that this speaks for itself, however it's worth noting you can make scripts for both your ships... and the game itself.


CONS:

Building game with consistent updates and new content. (Yes, the first pro)
 - This is also a terrible thing, in a way causing the stagnation it avoids by pushing away players who spent days/weeks/months on builds that no longer work, and to get the full benefits of the update that borked your build, you have to pay for the relevant DLC.

Pre-determined and size limited building spaces.
 - Most similar games that I can think of, you can build anywhere, you don't need to worry about getting too far from the workbench.  Survival should be this way, I agree, but not creative, please... not creative. (oh right about that)

No pre-set creative mode.
 - Your options for gamemodes are Career, Classic, and Custom.  Custom is as close as you're going to get, and to make it a decent creative save you'd need to click ""Enabled Addons"" and disable pretty much, if not everything.  Once in game you have to open the custom settings and turn off player damage, freeze time, disable weather... etc.  Please... Just add a creative mode... I realize it would just be a preset of Custom with the settings left on, but that's literally all Career and Classic are... so please... please...

SUMMARY:

If you're seeking an upgrade from Scrap Mechanic or Trailmakers, I highly recommend Stormworks, as I'm unlikely to return to those games or others I've tried.  That being said, Stormworks is a tool first and game second, if you expect to enjoy all of your time playing and want the game to hold your hand, stay way.",1693686213,1693686213,True,0,0,0.491803258657455444,0,True,False,False

The creativity this game has is almost unlimited. however there is nothing very entertaining aside from being creative. I would recommend this game as it is constantly being worked on and many of bugs happen dont effect playbility. however several do. making this game absolutely unplayable at times.. hence the reason for thumbs down.,1690559064,1693678221,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can certainly enjoy this game by just downloading other people's creations and doing the missions but for me it really shines when you buckle down and try to make something yourself. Jumping into the lua scripts unlocks a whole new level of depth of what you can achieve. Learning the art of PID tuning is certainly a love/hate experience. While not perfectly true to life (it is a game after all), there's a lot this game can teach you about the real world parallels. The core game usually gets lots of free upgrades/updates whenever they drop a DLC and they're pretty fairly priced IMO.

All that said there are a LOT of bugs and issues. Some of them seem like really easy fixes, like one of the workbenches for the trains just straight up spawns things in the wrong place. Why don't train signal switches also transmit their current signal (they should pick up the one in workshop that does)? Why are rope and winches so jank? Why do I need to figure out XML editing to make windows that don't suck? Why are block shapes so limited? NPC AI is some of the worst I've ever seen.

If you're willing to overlook some bugs and issues and have a passion for engineering/building stuff, there is a lot to love here, but a bit more polish would really go a long way.",1693677778,1693677778,True,12,1,0.628518342971801758,0,True,False,False

GPU: ASUS ROG RTX 3060 V2 12GB OC.
CPU: Ryzen 7 5800X,
RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO (32GB, 3600MHZ, CL18)

And with nothing spawned in, i get 60 fps,
With something large spawned in, 55 fps,
With two things spawned in? 30 FPS?
With something that goes 100km/h spawned in and moving? 25.
This is because physics is bound to the CPU, and only a SINGLE core, So you could have a two core processor with the same speeds as a Ryzen 7 5800X, and it would probably run, the same. (Badly).
Another problem, is multiplayer, you can't go faster than 100km/h in MP without phasing through your seat, even if you, and the host, are in the same province, and same country, using the same ISP.

The devs do not playtest anything they do to the game. When someone makes a vehicle they can make tool tips so you can easily reference controls, this menu is OPEN by default when you get in a vehicle. The devs did a ""bug fix update"" where they messed up this menu and the controls were no longer listed correctly. 2 minutes of testing the game wouldve found this bug.

This game has terrible performance, and the devs know it. when pressed about it they said ""don't spawn in crafts too large for your pc to handle."" For the low low cost of $10 the devs will spawn crafts too large and too numerous for your pc to handle, so you don't have to!

one time the devs pushed a lighting update that broke steam engines and said ""no we didn't"" when asked. After three months they pushed an update fixing ""bugs"" that quietly fixed steam engines.

whenever the devs make posts, they use images of vehicles from the workshop and don't credit their creators.

If you get the base game there are 3 things for you to do;
1: grab people and bring them somewhere
2: put out a fire
3: fix a vehicle and tow it somewhere

for $10 the weapon dlc will give you guns that shoot ammo so poorly implemented, that wherever the bullet lands, there is an explosion that deals a set amount of damage in a sphere, and the game will spawn a bunch of vehicles after the devs told you not to spawn too many vehicles, or vehicles too large. lets not forget the new activity;
1: shoot thing.

for another $10 you can get the industrial dlc that will add an empty continent, some animals, more rails for the trains that the devs break then don't fix for months, and no new activity, because ""bring things somewhere"" is very similar to 2 of the activities that we already had.

they've announced a space dlc, you know for their coast guard game. instead of fixing the issues the game has and making new free content that would make their game better, they are just banking on you paying an extra $10 every few months for some random ""update""

fix the dam game, devs.

UPDATE:
the new dlc is cool and all, but im still not recommending this game. the devs need to take a break from all the damn DLC's and focus on fixing the main game

here are my thoughts:

time to time, i find myself actually wanting to build Search & Rescue vehicles, but when it comes time to test them, like 95% of the missions are just... dead feeling. no sense of urgency (rip sharks) no sense of real success either since they are usually stupidly easy.

I've been with Stormworks from almost very beginning, long before the official release. It was my first purchase on Steam, I was a penniless student back then but still decided to support the game I had seen a great potential in. But soon, they started prioritizing weird things, mostly just because some players were very vocal about these things.
Weapons, steam and nuclear engines, complicated layouts, mining, oil and now space... Every update brought a lot of new content to the game, but along the way it completely lost its focus (and traded it for numerous bugs).
If you really want to make a game very open ended, you enable community to do some real modding. The way modding exists in Stormworks is just mere scripting with tons of restrictions (no modded components, no UI modding) so you cannot really add things there, while almost every of these updates they prioritized over the years made me think ""it could have been a mod"". If it would, developers could focus on really important core features instead which the game still lacks and will never get - gameplay is just a couple of repetitive missions, the open world is mostly empty land with nothing to do and so on.

It may seem wrong to write a negative review for the game I spent so many hours in (I mostly play offline so it's even more than Steam counter shows you) but there's nothing left to me at this moment. The game still has a great vehicle builder, but if you're looking for something more than just that you need to look somewhere else.",1693306119,1693306119,False,4,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False

There are still basic geometry pieces (like a 3x1 wedge block, a ton of window shapes) that aren't in the game. Three years after release. Instead, the devs release DLCs that don't fit the core of the game, like a warfare DLC. Most recently it's a space DLC. The game doesn't properly handle flooding and sealed compartments beyond the most basic shapes, but we're going to space. Great. 

Of course, the fanbase for games like this is around 60% people who would do on an IQ test like I would on a pacer test; maybe get ten points. They mainly download vehicles from the workshop, drive them around, then get bored and download something else. Of couse, these people Looooooove this update, because they get to scoot around for five minutes in a new environment. 

People building creations are stuck with the same frustrations as over a year ago though, not even the most basic shapes are available, interior spaces aren't handled right, flotation is abysmal, parenting doesn't work right, the multiplexed connections don't forward signal metadata, and core search and rescue missions aren't added.

However I can't forgive some things you have 1x1, 1x2, and 1x4 blocks but no 1x3s for whatever reason. Also if you like to build small things this games not for you, an example of what I mean can be shown very well in the modular engines where if you make them big it doesn't matter but if you make a small engine your cooling system well likely be bigger than the rest of the engine combined. The game is also terrible in the beginning as the tutorial sucks and doesn't teach you thing about building your own builds and as that's all there really is in this game as the SAR elements are super limited im suprised it building doesn't have a tutorial.                                                                                                                                    Now then with all of my ranting out of the way I can talk about my main issue with this game which is the devs and the update cycle. Their updates are very inconsistent and sometimes the minor updates will include actual useful blocks and other times our biweekly(once every 2 weeks) update will just be adding some inventory slots. You'd also think that the devs would try to avoid messing up vehicles too much with future updates but it feels like it happens all the time.                                                                                                                                    
      Im sorry but 2 more things I need to add here before I can wrap things up. First off you'd think that a smaller and lighter vehicle would go faster than a bigger and bulkier one but no your speed is capped by mass so there's a good chance you can go faster by adding more weight which I don't think makes sense but maybe im wrong. Secondly there's XML editing now by no means is this a bad thing it's just file editing to make some parts bigger or smaller but with the sheer amount of things it allows you to do it really feels like it should just be in the game base.                                                                                                                                                                                So if your here for SAR gameplay i wouldn't recommend it at all if your here to build it might be the game for you just expect to get frustrated every now and then.

This game started off as Stormworks Build and rescue, but now it is more like Stormworks build stuff and do random things (I added to someone else's idea of a name). This game went from many different mission types to less mission types and tools, to many things you can not get rid of useful only for sandbox such as meg and the kraken. You can not remove these items they are stuck in your world no matter what. then after that they started the downwards spiral, adding weapons(which I like but many do not) mining so you have to suffer to get your builds in career, to now space which if you read the comments on the post many do not like. 
This game started off really well, not catering to the children and adding good updates. But now its as if they don't listen to the community. People want updates to fix bugs and add to existing content not more things people have to pay for. And for this space dlc it was mostly children that wanted it, not the loyal community that has been here for years. But they still add it straying farther and farther from the games original intent. 
The only good major updates for the game was the addition of submarine missions and natural disasters. As this game gets farther and farther from its original premises the closer and closer we get to a decent dev making a competitor game for rescue. Stormworks please listen to your community, we want better S&R not space, or some alien thing for Halloween. We don't want more zombies, or more massive beasts in the ocean. We want more rescue missions and sea related things. 
As to leave this on a good note I will discuss the good things Stormworks has done. It is one of or the only good rescue game where you build your vessel how you want. You can choose your own path, you want to get a fast boat to get jobs done on the water you can. You want to make a plane or helicopter and rescue the idiots in boats of the sea, you can (if you can fly a plane). And with that I shall conclude with a rating.

This game gave me really high hopes, but left me severely disappointed in some major ways.

I would love to recommend this but I honestly can't with the current issues plaguing the game.
This game feels very much like an early access title. Yet is is supposedly already in a full release state.
[h1]Issues[/h1]
[h2]Controller support[/h2]
Controller support is listed as partial, which could be considered correct since I can setup my controller and it is recognized in the keybind menu, but it doesn't work for controlling any craft. Controller support is essentially neutered because the game has to switch between a keyboard mode and controller mode. That switching is done upon some arbitrary button push criterion. There used to be a simple hotkey to press to switch the modes, but that has since been removed, essentially killing controller support.
If the devs would bring back the switch button, as has been requested many times on their issue tracker, this would be resolved quickly.

[h2]Campaign mode[/h2]
Honestly I loved this mode, until I discovered that after a while the missions spawned require you to go so far away from your base that even with a highly fuel efficient vehicle you wont turn any profit because the fuel cost is more than the reward for the mission.
There are many ways to resolve this, the simplest would be to add some kind of mission reward modifier that can be set preferably per save to increase (or decrease) all mission rewards by some fixed percentage.

[h2]The devs[/h2]
I'll start with my own observations, later i will get into stories I've read online which raise more pressing issues.
To me it seems the devs don't really care about the present issues with the game and are stuck in a state of producing more 'features' and fixing minor low hanging fruit type bugs.
The recent announcement of the ""Space"" DLC only confirmed this for me, I was baffled and severely disappointed.
I love space games, and have put many hours into KSP and Simple Rockets 2. If done right, the Stormworks variant could be totally awesome.
But why focus on a brand new DLC that expands the game FAR beyond the scope of ""Build and Rescue"" if the ""Build and Rescue"" part of the game still has some not quite gaping yet still quite large holes in it.
For a game that claims to listen to feedback and sports large and obvious feedback and bug report buttons in the menu, it sure feels like that feedback is not taken seriously. Actively hindering or ignoring your community is not a good way to manage one. Work with us instead of against us. There will be many who cannot put things into perspective, but i think most community members want this game to become as awesome as the potential it has.

[h3]Now on to the hearsay.[/h3]
Keep in mind this is just stuff I've read, but the quantity and consistency of the reports does give it some credibility.
Take all of this with the appropriate skepticism.
I've read many things about the devs, but one thing that seems to be consistent is that some people are allegedly getting banned form the Stormworks discord just for mentioning their gripes and grievances with the game. This combined with the silence of the devs when it comes to reported issues does suggest that the devs do not tolerate public discussion of things the community considers wrong with the game.
A dev banning someone for speaking up about the issues present in the game, whilst also claiming to actively collect and review community feedback is simply inexcusable. This review might put me on to the alleged naughty list as well.
But until I have experienced this personally I cannot be certain any of this is true.


[h1]Good points[/h1]
[h2]Vehicle builder[/h2]
Vehicle customization is incredibly detailed, maybe even a little too complex for the average gamer.
But for me, as I am quite technically inclined and have a good bit of programming experience this is not much of an issue.
Compared to a game like From the Depths this game allows for a lot more fine grained detailing, since a basic cube has a side length of 0.25m whilst FtD has 1m. This means you can fit 64 Stormworks cubes into one FtD cube.
I have only 3 somewhat minor remarks regarding the building mode. 
[list]
  [*]  [b]Block options[/b]: The devs might want to take a look at the block shape options From the Depths offers. There are a lot more different options to make shapes that feel more rounded  in FtD even though Stormworks has a smaller block size.
  [*] [b]Glass and windows[/b]: The glass and window options in this game is way too limited. You can make it work, but that will either affect how water resistant your vehicle is or look as if some intern quickly built a glass birdcage around the openings. You will have bars where you don't want them and odd corners and protrusions just to make it work. There is a mod that fixes this, but honestly there shouldn't need to be a mod to fix this basic stuff.
  [*] [b]Logic clutter[/b]: Some things are unnecessarily complex to get done, requiring multiple sensors, functions and micro-controllers just to get some basic information that should have been a block of its own. All of this results in hundreds of logic connections of all types running through your vehicle. If you enable that view on even a moderately complex creation you are met with a spaghetti of green, red, purple, yellow, ... lines. Yes you can filter some of these out, but it still takes me way to long to figure out how the data flows in a specific creation. Composite lines help somewhat but those have the issue where it is not clear how the processing of that signal actually works and where it begins in case you connected it in a loop (which is entirely possible)
[/list]
[h2]Graphics[/h2]
They might look a bit basic at first, but this is quickly forgotten when you start playing.
Suddenly facing a giant wave in a thunderstorm at night is actually terrifying.
[h2]LUA scripting[/h2]
This opens up an essentially infinite amount of options in vehicle customization and behavior. This is unlike anything I've seen before.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I think this game is priced relatively good as it is. €21 for the base game and €8.20 for the DLC does not seem too much.
Yet the issues mentioned above still make it hard to recommend.
If the devs were to finally take the community feedback seriously and actually fix main the reported issues instead of some small bugs I might even be fine with a €30 base price and €10 for the DLC.
If you are fine with the issues mentioned above, feel free to give it a try.
If you are fine with being along for the ride in a game where the devs seem to think their opinion of how the game should be is the only correct one, and honest constructive community feedback is ignored at best and stifled at worst, go right ahead.

I am severely starting to regret this purchase. Getting so invested into a game only to have it disappoint you with issues that really shouldn't exist in a 'full release' game.
