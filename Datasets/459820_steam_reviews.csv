The 'titillating' portion of the game is tame. Ok, wow, you completed one section of the game, ok, woo, you get a picture, oh, wait is that a nipple, oh my god, I've never seen anything like this, I'm very excited.

This is in no way offset by the gameplay, because if anything, it's even MORE boring - on purpose. As with any game like this, there's a ceaseless effort from the devs to try to pick your pocket to speed things up or get new uninteresting content.

I loved the rebirth mechanic and I really enjoy the pop up events for unlocking characters and specific glamours. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy idle games. That all being said, I have a number of complaints. 

One: The story is bad, if at times extremely cringy and unfunny. It feels like it's written for 12 year olds. 
Two: The art is mostly inoffensive for any SFW content, however the NSFW art work looks distorted and wrong, much like art done by people who don't really know how to draw the lower female half. My husband and I have made memes of some of the art to make it look like a pussy was talking. That's how bad it is. 
Three: I ABSOLUTELY hate the stupid text message mechanic, it doesn't really add anything and you have a stupid notification bothering you the entire time.
Fourth: This is not a compliant for this game but I'm adding it here in case anyone likes this game and wants to play Blush Blush, this game receives a lot more care and attention than Blush Blush which is truly a disservice to the other game. This game receives events like the pop ups and holiday events, I've NEVER seen that in Blush Blush. It was shocking to see it once coming to Crush Crush because I played Blush Blush first.

You can probably get access to all the content for free over time, but I decided to support the developers by purchasing in-game boosts & currency [as well as some of the 'buy' only ladies]... not that you need or have to, but even after pumping a silly amount of money into this title, I don't feel cheated... the writing and characters were worth it, IMO, even if the scenes are just a few frames.

Plenty of other H-games out there feel like a straight up money grab, and while the game does encourage you to spend money to speed up progress, its not hard-locked behind pay walls. Granted, there are plenty of extra and limited time ladies you have to spend money [or in game currency, ""Diamonds""] on, but those are totally optional and there are 20+ ladies you unlock through regular game progression. You can also earn diamonds at higher relationship levels, so if you're willing to invest a boat load of time, you can play totally for free and still get boost from the Diamonds you earn... totally up to you.

The phone call/message aspect lends a refreshing take to an otherwise saturated genre, and also provides you with some nice pics to view at your leisure as you get further along in your ""texting"" relationships with the ladies in your phone book... my only gripe is having to be on a single conversation for it to continue progress [otherwise you get one message, go back, etc]... wish the ladies would just FINISH their convo and wait for your response, its an annoying progression-gate, devs!

All in all, a great ensemble of ladies from different genres and fetishes, all lovingly written and nearly all of them have actual voice-overs.

If you decide you're only going to spend a few bucks on the game, I highly suggest buying 'Catara' for her speed dating perk, it helps reduce quite a bit of clicky. You could also buy 'Suzu' for access to faster money-making early on, which can also help quite a bit.",1644014631,1644077188,True,9,0,0.609666585922241211,0,True,False,False

Overall/narrative
This is an idle clicker game that is FREE-ish more on that later. the game is just that a clicker game so anyone who has a mountain of time on their hands and isn't scared playing basically a ""mobile game"" which is available on the google play store and potentially the apple app store. (im not sure if it is or not) and the story is basic but gets the job done. you are a  humanoid marshmallow creature who is ether man or woman by default its set to male so that's what i went with (also im a man so there is that but the option is a pleasant one.) you meet Q-Pernikiss, a goddess of love looking for a vessel to fight back an evil being known as the The Dark One. and by fight i mean seduce her. ya see the way you become a ""Pure Vessel for Q-Pernikiss is you must become so masterful of seducing woman to be able to seduce The Dark One. in the end the portal the dark one came through must be closed and only a pure body of love can close it doing so they must sacrifice then selves. ya see sense your a pure vessle of love and what not you fit the bill to close the portal so at the ""end of the game"" you have a choice to sacrifice yourself or Q-Pernikiss and then the world lives happy ever after good job. however the end isnt really the end ya see in order to complete the game there is a soft reset mechanic going on where you restart your progress with all the girls but your stats increase this stat is called a reset boost which increases the speed of which you do jobs, level up you hobbies, and how fast you can do dates and other stuff. as the rewind boost increases to a max of 2048 you get faster and better at everything so the replay ability is endless if you want to keep playing the game for the ending however i found this more repetitive than fun then again i found a glitch to increase speed on everything (for the developers i will describe how to do it later hopefully they fix this so they can milk all your diamonds out of you for things that the glitch bypasses) it got to the point of me doing 2 or 3 runs through the game a day and then i got burned out of it for the day. in all its a steady game with interesting mechanics that i thoroughly enjoyed

Cast
in crush crush you meet an assortment of characters ranging from the New York inspired sassy filled Cassie to gamer girl Mio to a BEAR named Bearvefrly yes a bear. and everyone in between the cast is very diverse and very well rounded being added to every couple of months or so with more DLC characters. this game is filled with personality and charm each character being more memorable than the last a full list of characters is available online if you wanna meet each girl and what they are about. HOWEVER some DLC characters are only available for a short period of time or are seasonal only so if you wanna meet each and every character dont get your hopes up at the time of posting i only have less than half the DLC characters and i just missed out on one of the limited time event characters from a part of the game called the phone flings more coming up soon on that. but its very frustrating running out of characters to go though which is sad sense they all add to your reset boost when you do a soft reset. without DLC characters i was getting about 150 reset boost on average around 1000 reset boost already collected however once i PURCHASED the DLC characters that were available on December 15 2021 it doubled to over 300 reset boost each run. 

The Phone Flings
a major part of the game is the phone flings. what is a phone fling i hear you ask well a phone fling is where you talk with ADULT woman over the phone which devolves to the girl texting you like 10 times you respond once with a 2 choice option which by my awareness dose nothing but a few changes in dialog until the girl sends you a risky photo and rinse and repeat 3 to 6 times per girl. now i may be sounding like the phone flings are a bad thing but to quite the opposite actually the phone flings have more character building than most of the girls in the main game and the cast of characters are just as stunning as the ones from the main game. some of which if you finish the phone flings give you a chance to purchase main game equivalents to them that continue on in the main game one of which and from my understanding is the only free one of these main game continues is Peanut. she is a collage girl you meet in the phone flings that is continued in the main game. there are plenty of characters in the phone flings that make an appearance in the main portion of the game however catching them when they are available is no easy task your options are whatever the devs decide on whats avalable at that time. which is not very fun if ya ask me if i had my way id make all the characters avalable but at increased prices and have the ones you want to sell more of go on sale but that's just me. oh and dont worry a sofr reset will not reset your phone flings in any way other than the ability to start ones if a certain criteria is met an example i had was if you needed a hobby at a certain level and you got it up to that level and didnt click on the character even though you met the criteria if you do a soft reset you will loose the ability to play that character if you dont click on the character untill you meet the requirement again\

the DLC
there are 2 types of dlc in CRUSH CRUSH the first is in game DLC which includes buying diamonds and characters for real world money buying characters for diamonds and buying time slots and other boosts for diamonds. most of which i already covered. The second type of DLC is a 1 time purchase of 7 US dollars to unlock the 18+ Naughty content which includes alot of stuff. the first major difference is when you reach lover level with a girl you are gifted a sex scene which includes 2 slides with voice acting from the main character this can ranged depending on which character you seduce but the basic premises is fist slide is a picture of the girl in a very revealing pose with dialog describing you making love to the girl some times with voiced dialog sometimes without if you click on the girl in the first slide it will change this pose slightly which is a nice touch i didn't realize until like 300 reset boost its a small detail you can easily miss that i thoroughly enjoyed the second slide includes the girl on your bed laying down and you two talk well she talks and you listen with describing dialog included. overall its a very impressive improvement over the basic free lover level experience this isn't the only bonus for purchasing the DLC you get some of the clothing options unlocked for every girl including in game purchased DLC characters including a nude option and an underwear option this is another nice touch for those with particular intentions with this game. all other clothing can be bought with a one time purchase of each outfit INDIVIDUALLY so there is no one time buy to get everything unlocked you have to manually buy each outfit you want for 10 diamonds. this DLC adds a few more things such as making most photos from the phone flings NSFW and much more revealing luckily there is a toggle to turn the DLC on and off depending where your playing the game just flick the switch and your game is reverted back to the ""Free version""

But roses gotta wither so I'll live forever instead
And now I can't get rid of all of these storms in my head
Bring on the hemorrhaging
I guess I'll live inside your memory
Another distorted story that ignore the deceased
I'll live inside of a castle, pray I'm never released
I'd rather kick it in the dungeon 'cause I'm that kind of beast
I'll bet my heart on the cards because I trust me the least
(Let it die)
Pressure mounting, but I'm doomed without it
Precious moments zooming by, don't doubt it
Rest is ephemeral, scream and shout it
The best don't sleep, I was all about it
(Let it die)
But reaping keeps you tucked in the shadows
This creeping feeling of identity battles
Closing in on every side of me
Red tomorrow, red today
Dread, sorrow, can't turn away
(Can't turn back...)
Time, I'll always be a prisoner to my ambition
As petals fly, I'll dance your tune
But hold your breath, guess who's running the show?
And when this red runs black I'll
Ask you, was I everything you imagined?
When the time's finally up, the sun's falling down
I'll turn to stone again
Every day's a fight to stay relevant
And it cannot last, so relish it
Our planet's vast, but this hole's a ditch
Toss out the past, and strike it rich
Nobody asked if the mask is not the right fit
In this fiction, it's no disaster in spite of it
I said, curious, what comes after it?
It's mysterious, and yet I exist
Hold on
Stay beautiful, stay young
There are blades to be swung yet
Rising soon
Regard the moon
Reflected in the crimson tone tonight
Red tomorrow, red today
Dread, sorrow, can't turn away
(Can't turn back...)
Time, I'll always be a prisoner to my ambition
As petals fly, I'll dance your tune
But hold your breath, guess who's owning the throne?
So come alive now
Once again, so I can chase you down
We are five minutes away from...
The end, it's come
Continue slashing forward I must
Or else just fade away
There's a drive to strive inside all of us
A never-ending ouroboros
It can weigh you down and it's all because
Yeah, thinking that reaping is all there was
(It is now!)
I gotta find a way and escape how fate
Has a funny way of shaking the weak down
Am I gonna peak now?
Future lookin' bleak, wow
Somehow incomplete after all
(Can't turn back...)
Time, I'll always be a prisoner to my ambition
As petals fly, I'll dance your tune
Don't hold your breath for me!
And when this red runs black I'll
Ask you, was I everything you imagined?
When the time's finally up, the sun's falling down
I'll turn to stone again
So come alive now
Once again, so I can chase you down

People gotta eat.  Yet I still much prefer to know what I'm paying for up front than to get bled to death with the slow, tempting allure of in-app microtransactions.

So let's just get this out of the way: if you're the kind of person without a lot of either disposable income [i]or[/i] patience, don't get this game (assuming you haven't already learned this lesson with one waifu gacha game or another).  But if you're up for the challenge of balancing a small purchase here or there with a healthy dose of delayed-gratification conditioning, you could certainly do worse than Crush Crush.

Conceptually, Crush Crush is a simple idle game.  You meet girls, work jobs, practice skills, and earn money over time (real time).   The money can be used to purchase gifts for your ever-growing harem, allowing you to attain higher and higher relationship levels with them, which in turn leads to unlocking more girls, jobs, and skills.  You also earn diamonds from advancing with different girls, which are the [i]real[/i] currency in this game, allowing you to purchase things from the store (like time skips, speed boosts, and additional characters), and can also be used to substitute for the in-game money you earn from working jobs.  Of course, extra diamonds (generally) cost extra money.  And if you want to speed things up, you can soft-reset the game for a faster track back to your current spot and beyond - the speed boosts are permanent and you can soft-reset as many times as you like.

What really stands out with Crush Crush is the production values.  First and foremost are the characters.  Rather than being the usual hentai cutouts, they're engaging, well-written, nicely drawn (save for a few serious cases of anime bug-eyes), and exquisitely voice-acted.  With self-conscious humor, smart cultural references, and (generally) non-gratuitous sex appeal, they put girls from other idle games like ""Booty Calls"" to shame, and you'll likely find one or two CC girls which you desperately wish were real (sigh ... Peanut ...).  And the great thing is that the Panda team is constantly adding new ones, and finding new ways to do it - most recently with the addition of ""Phone Flings"", where you ""text"" with the girls instead of ""talking"" with them, and they send you naughty sex-pix in return.  And on a couple of occasions now they've held fan votes to write PF girls into the main game as datable characters.  Overall, it shows a lot of commitment and care by this team, which is how a good idle game should be (what with them being the cash-cows that they are).

Of course, you don't have to go broke playing this game - so long as you are willing to wait and spend your money wisely.  Diamonds come from reaching new relationship levels with different girls and by direct purchase in the store, but you can earn one or sometimes three each day by logging in and hitting a one hour counter (you have to remember to come back later to claim your prize, though).  (Incidentally, this is also how you get access to the additional girls beyond the base set, which generally require a login every night for two weeks to hit a one-second counter that lets you immediately claim credit without coming back later.)  As performing soft-resets is a big part of the game, you'll want to avoid spending your diamonds on things which don't persist through a reset, like gifts or time skips (as opposed to, say, speed bursts or extra time blocks).

Once you finally make it all the way with a given girl, you're rewarded with a still-photo sex ""scene"", which you can replay later on at will.  It's reasonably satisfying, but the real fun is in the journey, just listening to the interesting lines you'll get as each relationship progresses, and seeing how each girl reacts to ""tickle attacks"".  Overall, it's a rewarding experience - and that's saying something in an oversaturated niche of mediocre cash-sinks.",1580995987,1580996400,True,43,4,0.762310564517974854,7,True,False,False

That aside for about $7 you can get the ""Naughty DLC"".  Right now I am not sure what to think as you probably need to put hours and hours into the game to get to the real ""naughty"" content (early on it does seem to give you some nip-slip type footage).

Pros:
* Its free.  So unless you want the naughty bits its here to play.  It is ""freemium"" however, allowing purchases of premium currency to accelerate the game.  It really doesn't offer any game play aside from mindless clicking.
* Voice acting.  It has some decent voice acting and even some goofy lines delivered straight out of pop culture.  Like the one about a heart full of neutrality or boobies being the most erotic part of a woman (Futurama).

Cons:
* Limited gameplay.  Aside from mindlessly clicking and occasionally managing hobbies or jobs there isn't anything to really do but wait.
* Freemium Content.  So its not a deal breaker for me really.  I even paid the 7 bucks for the Naughty DLC but if that unlocked anything beyond naughtiness I didn't notice.  Would be nice to throw the people who did get the Naughty DLC a bone in the form of a boost or something to commemorate their support of Naughty DLC...just saying.

In all if you want to kill time and are into the waifu simulator, to the extent of basically talking and dating (not a lot of dress up or customization though there are a wide variety of anime girl tropes from Ditz with Huge Boobs to Emo Catgirl to Anime Otaku Hentai Perv Girl) you can do worse.  The voice acting is the main reason I can recommend it, without that it would be an exceedingly dull game.

Edit:  After playing for a while I can confirm the naughty DLC does add quite a bit of naughtiness.  However I have also discovered the game absurdly curves requirements.  Just about 2-3 days of idle play into the game and it now requires close to $100 million plus in cash to advance some stories.  This means basically 5-10 days of straight idling with the job mechanics to get that kind of money or spending the ""premium"" currency, diamonds.  It skews a bit too hard for my liking.  But since its an idle game I don't really care, but it does stunt the games fun a whole lot.",1568411705,1579655059,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The girls are pretty diverse, with one exception, so there is something for everybody. The events in the game are pretty easy and reward loyalty, so if you have time to log in once a day, you can get lots of fun rewards, including getting more girls for your roster. There is some small plot going on, though it happens pretty late in the game. You have the option to have nudity in the game or not, if you buy the patch that allows nudity, and then turn it on in your game menu, so if that's your thing, they do have it. That's the positive. 

Now the negative. The game doesn't have any black women as main characters, and I actually don't remember any phone flings that were black either, though there were a couple women of color. I think literally two. And similarly, most of the fully fledged characters are also white, with three or four exceptions, out of nearly thirty characters. So if racial diversity is important to you, this is not your game. Furthermore, on the subject of race, the characters of color tend to have really bad, exaggerated accents that are clearly being done by people who do not have that accent, which is uncomfortably close to a racist mockery. The only thing that saves it from being blatantly racist is that they also fake the British accents very badly, with the actresses slipping in and out of the accents a bit, and just altogether sounding more comical than sexy or enticing. However, faking a British accent is very different from faking the accent of someone from India or Brazil, and carries with it a racist undertone that made those characters a really uncomfortable experience to play. Just get someone from that part of the world to do the lines! I'm sure there are many people who would offer, rather than have really awful and racist accents show up in the game.

On to the art. The costumes are fantastic. Hair, great and beautiful and varied. Faces are also pretty good! But I'm 99 percent sure that the person who does the art has never seen a vagina in their life. Every single one of the girls looks like her vagina was glued onto her body, like it's sitting on top of her body like a pair of underwear rather than attached to her. It's disturbing and unnatural. Furthermore, Bonnibel's pubic hair is horrifying, she looks like she has a literal red, bloody streaked rash on her vagina. Basically, the ladies look like they glued a seashell to their crotch and it is really bad. Why are they so huge and puffy? Honestly, the nudity patch is almost not worth it because of this, so if you're really into that kind of thing, I'd pass on this game. 

TLDR: So essentially, it's a fun game with an upbeat tone! But it is a little racist, and the nudity is comically bad, but other art is just fine!",1573633639,1573633725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros

● Unlike many dating sims, this offers nearly full vocal dialogue.

● Has hobbies to train your skills, such as motivation, wisdom, lucky, and nine more, giving a sense of time needed to improve.

● Ability to work multiple job and train hobbies at the same time.

● Can reset the game to increse the speed at which stats, jobs or relationships level up.

● Free to play, but gives the option to buy diamonds, a special in game currency, if you want to.

Cons

● Once you get to higher levels in your relationship, stats, or jobs, it takes much longer to level up(six hours to level up a skill from 44 to 45 at the fastest multiplier for speed increase).

● The game gives you a cap on the number of actions you can do at one time, dependent on the number of available ""time blocks"" you have, and the cost of these actions. Later on you need to train multiple skills at the same time to progress to certain points in the game. If you don't have a lot of time blocks, training those AND working jobs can be impossible, meaning you may have to switch back and forth.

● Can be considered similar to a freemium game. Meaning it's free to play, but you have to pay to progress quicker. Again, quicker, not quickly.


Conclusion

If you don't mind the pay to progress aspect OR the much slower leveling, you will enjoy this game. If this style of gaming is not for you or you don't like the concepts I listed, I recommend looking for a different game.",1545937936,1545938274,False,4,0,0.553539812564849854,0,True,False,False

How should I put it... this game is actually like one of those Facebook ""waiting game"" and a clicker game cleverly disguised as a dating sim. When you actually have the game opened, your time will be spent getting the required criteria to ""level up"" your relationship with a girl. When you run out of money or lack the skill level to further improve relationships, you'll need to earn (in-game) money and train your skills, which happen in real time. Therefore, you can either leave the game idle or just close the game with the meters running; you'll reap the rewards the next time you open the game.

So here's the thing: while I said it's a cleverly disguised dating sim, it is not, in fact, a dating sim. That's because your ultimate goal is to max out the relationship with all the available girls, so you don't really make any important choices like picking one girl over the other. There are no negative choices you can make that will ruin your relationship with any girl, no quizzes with right and wrong answers. It's just a grind from start to finish, rinse and repeat kind of game. Probably the only things you do in this game are clicking on the girls for hearts [spoiler](which is something easily accomplished with an auto-clicker software)[/spoiler] and planning your activities efficiently, the latter which gets stale late game when you have more than enough time blocks.

The plus side about this gem is that it has a somewhat nice art style. That, and the girls' not-so-subtle reference to modern pop culture. You have your standard line-up of a [i]tsundere[/i], a gamer girl, and a ""cosplaying"" cat girl, but there are also girls who are also right out of other genres ([b]SPOILERS![/b]: [spoiler]Ayano is from the Yandere Simulator game, Iro is a reference to Rainbow Dash from the My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic cartoon[/spoiler], etc.) so if you're a modern day geek like me, you'd give the game points just for those.

I would recommend this game, since it's free anyway; you have nothing to lose but your virginity. Wait, scratch that last part...",1488273978,1488273978,True,20,7,0.666630029678344727,0,True,False,False

The game itself is incredibly charming. Fantastic dialogue, the characters are unique, and the art is enjoyable. All these exceeded my expectations for a free game, and because of that, I actually spent a bit of money. Support people that do good work.

If I spend $10 in the free to play game's store, I expect to be able to reach the finish line in under a year.

I guess it is closer to a thumbs up than a thumbs down, but this is a lame finish to what started off as interesting.

I love Crush Crush for it's art, it's humor, and it's gosh darn addictive quality (Having played every single version from the Kongregrate original on the day it first came out to the Steam Version also on the day it first came out to the Nutaku version also you guessed it, on the first release day) . Having invested at least over a day in active play time with this version (And possibly a lot more in the kongregate version and less in the Nutaku version since I wasn't in the mood for a grind) and with the two last girls still on my to do list, I can personally say I've invested a lot of time into this game. As for the recommendation?
Well that's a bit more of complex subject. Although I love this game and I hate to say it, but that recomandation is based on my personal style of play. So you only need to ask yourself a few questions as to whether or not Crush Crush is for you;
1) Are you a perfectionist?
2) Do you have free time?
3) Are you addicted to achievements?
4) Do you like anime waifus?
If you anwsered yes to one or more of the above questions, congrats, Crush Crush is for you.
So here comes the part where I lay into Crush Crush...
So the biggest problem I have and many others like me, is that the difficulty curve for this game, in particular at the end game, is H*CKING high. You will grind, you will farm, you will grovel on your knees and beg for mercy. But those last two girls Karma and Sutra will burn your soul alive. (And Luna to because the mystical slippers literally can not be bought without a massive grind of cash or forking over a diamond). I am not joking in saying that despite having near max multiplier AND store diamond based multipliers, it STILL takes a silly amount of time to get anything done for those last two girls. The difficulty curve is just to darn high. That in itself is my only real complaint for the game. I love everything else. But if your not playing this for the long haul and or are not willing to fork some real life cash for diamonds, the end game hell awaits you. (Which technically is my other complaint but I don't mind forking over a little cash to help the devs.)
(But seriously, I love this game and recommend you give it a go. Just don't expect any breaks once you get to the end game because buddy, your in it for the long haul.)",1487057284,1487057284,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

well... where do I begin? It was a bright and sunny tuesday morning, the birds were chirping, and the sweet morning dew covered my front lawn. The crisp cool air, rushed through my hair, as I walked down my front steps to go retrieve me mail. I opened the mailbox door and pulled out the papers within. Running my fingers along the lightly damp envelops I noticed a peculiar letter. ""To whom it may concern,"" it read. ""This coming Friday Feburary the 10th great things will happen."" That is all it said; nothing more was to be found within the envelop except for that letter. I looked up and turned around to retire to my home. I waited three days until that friday, and that's when it all started. When I woke up that morning I felt odd. Something wasn't right. I could feel it. I went about my day, tending to my spice garden, and tinkering with the toys I once played with as a child, reminding me of the days when resposibility was as distant figure standing in the shadows, only to emerge years later as a grotesque beast, that would entomb me. The memories of a long lost childhood, returned for a moment, allowing me to experience the joyous days of years past. I looked up from my desk full of toys only to notice a shimmering light coming from behind me. I turn around only to notice my computer had awoken from sleep, only to display what would be the most terrifying entity in existance. The screen simply read, ""crush crush."" I walkover to my computer and pull my chair out from my desk. I take a seat and put my hand on my mouse. I move the cursor to the button that would forever change me; ""play."" I press my mouse down and the screen goes blank. An instant later a creature with horendous bodily proportions appears on my monitor. My stomach immediately began to churn and my room began to spin in my head, The nausea, although overwhelming, could not stop me from noticing the pain given to me from the game from enslaving my eternal soul. Like a demon from the eternal fires of hell it latched onto my soul, morphed it, violated it. Before I could think again the most vile creature that I have ever encountered. The ears stood tall, but the body stood taller. the creature, a neko girl. My heart raced and a sharp pain raced down my arm. My breathing grew heavy, then silence. My pulse was no more. I shattered the screen with the last ounce of strength I had. The screen went blank and the glass that made up the panel was shattered into thousands of shards. I looked at my monitor and could see my distortred reflection in the fractured panel of glass. I watched as I took what I was sure would my last breath. My vision went dark along with my thoughts. I awoke in a hospital bed. lines from bags of saline ran down and into my arm. The doctor walked in. ""you're lucky to be alive he said."" ""what happened?"" I ask him. He looked at me, then glanced down to the right, ""crush crush.""

Please save yourself the pain. If you value your life go nowhere near this detriment of a game. Stay strong, stay safe, and goodluck if you refuse to heed my warning.

It revolves around Speed Boosts to do anything in the game and since there is a max of 2048 that you can get by restarting the game, you're beginning to be forced to pay for the additional multipliers.

No matter how much a game requires you to pay for things to get further, I'm a cheapskate and will sit and alter the years on my computer in order to speed up the process. I'm pretty sure I already sped the game up by more than a 1000 years.
1,000 years of waiting and still not have the last two girls like me.
Much like real life.

If I weren't such an achievement whore, I'd have dropped this game, smashed it to pieces with a hammer, let a homeless man use it as toilet paper and sent it back to the devs.
Because it's a pile of shit.

You have resources (time), you allocate these resources to gather goods (money or hobby levels), you use goods to gather more resources (more time blocks). You hit a ceiling at some point in which more resources cannot be obtained; then you ""reset"" and in the next incarnation certain benefits take place (prestige bonus) that allow you to break through the previous ceiling.

This category of game is very little about gaming, and more about managing resources and achievement hunting. Usually the premise doesn't play any role, but CrushCrush tries to shine in its market by offering the ""dating simulator"" premise (which is VERY questionable), kawaii waifus and a very, very, VERY pink interface. But by far the most attractive point of CrushCrush is the fact that it is ""F2P"". Quotes intended.

As I said, the premise doesn't matter for this kind of game, but it has its touch of humour at some points which is a plus. The art is okay, awkward sometimes. What kills it - beware my friends - is the fact that there is a limit in ""resetting"". And it is not of the reasonable kind.

After the obtaining the modest 2048 multiplier, your resets give you no further benefit and by all means there is not a reason to reset anymore. Alternatively... you can keep going further by affording Speed Boosts in the ""$$$ Store <3"". Of f***ing course. Let me give you an idea of [i]how bad[/i] it is, shall I? So if you spend, let's say, 10$-ish and get a x64 Speed Bonus, you'll have a 2048x64 multiplier. Having in mind the wooping 2048x8192 multiplier, it doesn't take a genious to realize that Speed Bonuses are [i]absolutely necessary[/i] for this game. As a F2P you can afford some of these Speed Boosts with bonuses you get along the game, but nowhere near the 8192. Sadly, I did buy the bonus at the beginning before I realized that this game was unreasonably unbalanced.

Don't go on trying to defend the game devs by throwing the ""it is supposed to last forever!!"" kind of cards. According to the maths in the official forums, a F2P player would need, after obtaining the maximum Prestige and free Speed Bonus, 2 years to unlock the last two girls. I am not talking about two years of fun, dedication and love. I am talking about two years of [i]not playing the game[/i], because there is absolutely [i]nothing[/i] more to do there, other than [i]waiting two bloody years[/i]. Even for a game that it is [b]*not*[/b] about gaming, this has crossed the line between the ""lulz"" and the ""wth? O.o""

Advice to the devs: tune your game down, Karma and Sutra are unreasonable. It takes about a week for someone with MAXED stats to get Golden Slippers. I'd wait a week if your game had something else to offer during this week, but when instead it literally tells me ""forget me, come back next week"" I might as well not come back at all. Lift the Prestige Bonus Limit, or at least raise it. A Lot. Add more girls in between Karma and Luna to help F2P to farm Diamonds for Speed Boosts.

Also, personal advice: this game is hosted somewhere else, a website which has been rumoured to scam customers with ""fake drop ratios"" for some of the other games they host. I have witnessed some of it myself and ever since never logged back.",1485368071,1485368635,False,47,2,0.591994941234588623,0,True,False,False

In the tags section of this game, you may have noticed a word called nudity, and maybe that was the driving force that sent you to check this game out, 'Oh boy, time for me to enjoy some good hentai!' But unfortunately, you'd be terribly mistaken. Because as of writing this review; there isn't any nudity. 

""Crush Crush; yet another clicker game that demands you to waste your life sitting in a chair in your room clicking your mouse furiously with the ultimate reward of wasting your life.""

Now for such a game, you'd think that it surely should have nudity. No. It doesn't.

So, what is the point of this game then? Well, the point of this game is to spend roughly two hours of sitting in your chair, secluded in your room, clicking furiously trying to woo this girl becuase you think that you will be rewarded with a pair of jugs. Nope. After roughly two hours (it really depends on how enthusiastice you are on seeing those jugs....not that there is any) All that happens is you achieve the status of her being your girlfriend. But once you have made her your girlfriend, what the hell do you do now? There is no more progression after that; unless you want to start all over with one of the other girls (which there are plenty of). But i''m sure as hell not sitting here, furiously clicking on my mouse for roughly two hours, when i don't even get to see the slightest piece of nudity in the end. Therefore, it really is rather pointless and is undoubtedly, a waste of time and, your life.

But that isn't all there is to the game! There is music and there is sound effects, though unsurprisingly, it is rather gay sounding; thankfully though, you can easily mute it on and off.

So, i've shared my piece on the games nudity, but that pretty much sums the game up itself in that paragraph. What do you do in the game? In layman terms, Crush Crush is a girlfriend simulator. You start off with a girl that you coincedentally meet somehow, and your ultimate goal is to keeping wooing her until you reach the status of her being your girlfriend. That's all. Naturally, as you progress through the different stages of the relationship (acquaintances, frenemies, crush, girlfriend) you require more points and skill points in order to advance. That is either a hell of a lot of clicking, or just wait 'till you have enough money from your job, and then take her to the movies which usually gives you all the points you need. But apart from the points, i also mentioned skill points; which you gain from hobbies that you undertake. In some cases, you need a certain skill point level to progress with a girl. You also need to have a job that they want. So, you need to change jobs frequently to meet their needs, obviously, different jobs have different income which you can spend on gifts and dates. 

The game really is self explanatory in it's own way, so you don't need an instruction manual on how to play the thing.

That's about all there is to the game. You spend hours wooing a girl and you get nothing in return. Oh i suppose you get achievements, maybe you want to get a 100% achievement rating for a game; in that case, this game shouldn't be too hard to get that achievement.

But the game itself, really is pointless. Unless they release a nudity mod/patch or whatever, which quite possible could happen, (nowing the weeaboo community). But then again, it's a lot easier and quicker to just go on Google Images and search up hentai.

Crush Crush is free, so there is no harm in giving it a try, but; what on earth is the point of it?",1485028868,1485028868,False,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False
