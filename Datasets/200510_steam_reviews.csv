[b] 5/5 [/b] 👽👽👽👽👽
XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a gaming gem that [b] redefined turn-based strategy, [/b] a title that blends tactical brilliance with heart-pounding (close-up) action and suspense seamlessly. From the moment you're tasked with defending Earth against an extraterrestrial invasion, the weight of command rests squarely on your shoulders.
[h3] Makes you a true tactician 😎 [/h3]
The depth of strategic decision-making in XCOM is unparalleled. Every move matters, every decision carries consequences. Whether it's [b] managing your base, researching new technologies, or engaging in turn-based combat, [/b] every aspect is finely tuned to keep you engaged and challenged. The tension of not knowing what lurks around the corner, combined with the satisfaction of executing a flawless plan, creates an addictive gameplay loop that's hard to put down.
[h3] Some words about your Adversaries and your Allies 👿😇[/h3]
The variety of alien adversaries keeps you on your toes, each requiring a unique approach to overcome. [b] The first time you see a new type of alien is always a stress- and fearful moment because you don't know yet what they can do and how to fight it. [/b] And the progression system, as you develop your squad members and unlock new abilities, adds a layer of personal investment that makes every soldier's fate feel significant.
[h3] Graphics - pretty decent and lovely zoomed-in action 🌄🔫 [/h3] 
Graphically, while not groundbreaking by today's standards, the [b] aesthetic holds up well, [/b] and the [b] atmosphere is brilliantly crafted, [/b] immersing you in a world on the brink of destruction.
[h3] Are there any CONs? 😥[/h3]
However, XCOM isn't without its challenges. The [b]difficulty curve can be punishing, [/b] especially for newcomers to the genre. Losing beloved squad members to a single wrong move can be devastating, but it also adds to the game's intensity and makes each victory all the sweeter.
[h3] Buy it! Especially on Sale:) [/h3]
Enemy Unknown is a timeless classic that deserves its place among the (turn-based) strategy gaming greats. Its blend of [h3] deep strategy, compelling gameplay, and intense atmosphere [/h3] make it a must-play for any fan of the genre.

So I'm going to talk about EW, and then I'm going to talk about the single greatest strategy game ever made.

I'm probably not going to go over the basics of XCOM because I have other things to say and plenty of people have already done that well enough in these reviews. (This is a fancy way of saying I don't feel like it.) Suffice it to say, vanilla XCOM is: Go on whatever missions the game hands you, get up as many satellites as possible, defend them/shoot down UFOs. There's of course more to this incredible game, but I want to talk about something even more interesting. Enemy Within is: Try to balance haste and caution during missions as you attempt to track down two special resource canisters, randomly spawned throughout most standard mission types, without dying horribly. You then use this resource to commit war crimes against your fellow man for betraying his genome... You can just as well use it against aliens but I had to make a joke about the fact that you can just make actual walking warcrimes in this game. There's also a few new enemy types and I think probably some other stuff too. (Again, never really played the base game because I picked up the game when Enemy Within was released and why would you ever go back) If it sounds like I'm rushing, it's just because I want to get to the good part.

Now to tell you about the greatest strategy game ever made! Long War. Long War is a total overhaul mod for XCOM that adds such an unspeakable amount of depth to the game that I'm genuinely unsure if you could master it in only 10,000 hours. Don't believe me? I'll give you an example. The aliens have resources. No, you don't need to reread that. The aliens straight up have tech and resources just like you do, and they have to do missions in order to further their goals. Want to attempt taking on a landed large UFO in March? (first month of the game) Sure! Just so we're clear, large UFOs have a high crew count and are extremely difficult and risky to take on, even in March, when the aliens are just starting their progression. Nevertheless, there are people who will successfully pull this off. On the hardest difficulty. These people are also known for being very unhinged and named Beaglerush. I'm getting off track. Here's the best part: Do you think you merely get loads of resources for taking the UFO, just because it was a large? No. Long War would never, COULD never be that shallow. That UFO was gathering resources... (presuming that was its mission type) And no one was ever counting on XCOM storming the UFO and taking out its entire crew compliment. If you pull this off, it will cripple the aliens- (temporarily, although considering that XCOM also gains from this, and that I'm pretty sure aliens need resources in order to do their progression, I think it would have some form of snowballing effect, possibly even a significant one.) Forcing them to send mediocre units into battle, as well as inhibiting really anything that they need resources to accomplish. This should make your life easier in almost every way, except for EXALT. EXALT is cringe. We do not like EXALT. But remember, that's what warcrimes are for. Oh, also if you cripple the aliens they might not send out units you want/need so I guess that could make your life a little harder, but the aliens get screwed over far more than you do. (Editors nots: EXALT is the human terrorists who are trying to side with the aliens. They're from Enemy Within.)

That was just one example of Long War's depth and brilliance. There are surely countless others, and lots and lots of details that I didn't mention. Sorry if this is a little disjointed, I'm a bit tired. Honestly just kind of shocked that I've never written any form of review for this game. Maybe I wanted to wait 'til I had 1000 hours or something. Felt that Long War was more in need of reviewing than the base game. I'm barely even qualified to review it. I don't have that many hours on Long War. And I hope it wasn't too technical, I tried to make things sound as straightforward as I could.

Also, the game is stupendously buggy. Long War seems to... Exaggerate this. But if you've read this far you probably already know that :P


Anyway, I suppose I should give my summarized review of this game. I think the description of Impossible difficulty in the base game does it best:

""For those who find joy in suffering."" This game is shit. I love it. You're going to get attached to your soldiers, and they're going to die. They're going to die even after you've learned all your lessons the hard way. You're going to be sad and discouraged and maybe even quit; and then you're going to go back and keep playing. Because Earth needs you, because war crimes I mean MECs are cool, but most importantly...

Because you've finally found an experience worth a damn. No other tactical or strategy game will ever hold a candle to this one... Even if they have a better airgame. And you know why? I can tell you why. It's because you missed that one 99% shot. Your best laid plans will be laid to ruin, and honestly? I've never known another game-- Hell, another experience that can consistently leave a pit in my stomach like this one does. And I don't think I'm the only one.


May you find joy in suffering... And good luck, Commander.",1707626747,1707626747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

xcom: enemy unknown is a 2012 turn-based tactics game developed by firaxis games, an american developer best known for developing the civilization & xcom franchises, as well as many games bearing sid meier's name. it was published by 2K, who purchased firaxis in 2005 (firaxis was founded in 1996). this is a 'reimagined' & 'rebooted' version of the classic 90s x-com games, namely the 1994 classic x-com: ufo defense. the player controls a worldwide military organization called 'xcom' during an alien invasion of earth. you control troops in the field during tactical turn-based missions, but between missions, you direct the research and development of technology using things you recover during missions in the field. after a failed reboot attempt in 2003,  development of what eventually became this began in 2008 and lasted over four years. while it was initially envisioned as an exact remake of the 1994 game, the dev team streamlined various gameplay mechanics and introduced improvements to modernize the franchise for a new audience. it was revealed/announced in january 2012, and ended up releaseing in october of that same year for pc, ps3, and xbox 360. mobile ports came at various points between 2013 & 2014, and a ps vita port released in march 2016.

this 2012 reboot stands as a monumental achievement in the turn-based strategy genre. firaxis masterfully blended intense tactical action, deep strategic gameplay (in multiple ways), & and a genuinely gripping narrative. aesthetically, the game is way more polished and stylized compared to the 90s games, using way more realistic graphics overall (going from the 90s pixel graphics to early 2010s animations was a huge jump in quality obviously), and the isometric view gives a good vantage point to view all the detailed environments. the audio design further elevates things, as the soundtrack complements the ambiance, whether you're in the middle of tense combat or in eerie calm moments exploring the map.

the biggest strength however lies in the turn based tactical combat. the game strikes a delicate balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for strategy enthusiasts like myself, especially given difficulty variance. the isometric grid-based maps provide ample opportunity for tactical maneuvering and strategic tactics. the variety in soldier classes allows for diverse squad compositions and personalized playstyle(s) no matter what. the macro-management experience of the geoscape offers further strategic elements of the game. making critical decisions on research priorities, engineering projects, and more adds an interconnectedness to missions and keep players engaged throughout the entire campaign. it would be remiss if i didn't mention permadeath, which heightens the stakes in every way during every mission. mis-clicks, mis-judgments, and any kind of (even minor) mistake can lead to losing a soldier, which can be genuinely heart-wrenching and helps emphasize to players the importance of careful planning and keen decision-making. 

the narrative is slightly generic, as a rehashing of the 1994 classic nit still does an amazing job introducing new players as well as veterans to the rich lore, conveyed through a combination of in-game events, research discoveries, and character interactions. the urgency of the alien threat is effectively conveyed, and the player's emotional investment in the fate of humanity grows as the narrative unfolds. the simplicity of the plot and quickness in which it can be completed leads to the game offering substantial replay value. the dynamic nature of the campaign ensures no two playthroughs are exactly alike, encouraging exploration with different soldier classes, strategies, and research paths. there is also ironman mode, which disables save scumming, enhancing the challenge and replayability for those seeking an even more hardcore experience. there's also a ton of mods, but as i played the entirety of my playtime in vanilla, i can't speak much more to it than i know there's a solid modding community compared to most games. 

xcom: enemy unknown stands as a testament to firaxis games' ability to revive a classic franchise while maintaining its core essence. the immersive presentation cements its status as an early 2010s classic not even just in the turn based strategy genre, but in gaming in general. regardless of whether you're a fan of the original x-com series or a newcomer to the xcom games or the genre as a whole, this is a must-play title that should continuously be celebrated for the depth of strategic gameplay.",1707018774,1707018774,True,17,1,0.638992488384246826,0,True,False,False

That being said, I can never relax playing this game as every move has the potential to completely destroy your team. On harder difficulties, this typically necessitates restarting if your high ranking soldiers die because you fall behind the curve and cannot catch up. You can save-scum, but this really goes against the spirit of the game as it clearly wants you to try and continue in these situations.

What truly sours the experience is the weak marriage between the meta game and the in-mission battles. Ideally, you would have been able to choose exactly where to launch your missions and select the rewards according to a long-term strategy. Instead, XCOM is essentially just a game of tactics, responding to events as they pop up and never really feeling like you're on top of what the game is throwing at you. Why can't I manage several squads at once and send them on multiple missions? Why are classes assigned to soldiers automatically instead of allowing me to choose? Why can't I station some soldiers in a particular country to respond quickly to panic? These are just a selection of controls that you don't have access to, thereby severely restricting the strategic aspect of this game.

Then, of course, is the actual squad management in mission. When you spot a bunch of enemies, they all immediately take cover whilst your soldiers do not. Full cover is not cover. Enemies hit my soldiers so consistently as if they were standing out in the open. Damage is variable, so your shotgun blast is not a reliable way of killing the enemy. Hit chance is variable, so a shotgun blast at point blank range is not a reliable way of killing the enemy. Panic sets in so easily that your hardened marines are not a reliable means of killing the enemy. To the game's credit, it [i]does[/i] have some interesting features: suppressing fire, elevation bonuses, breakable cover, etc. But many of these are accessible/useful only at a certain rank where it should have been a default feature for all your marines. 

The point of the game is fairly clear - war is completely unfair. You can do everything right and still end up with a poor outcome. However, it is a game after all. Would anyone want to play a game where [b]you[/b] are an XCOM marine, given their life-expectancy? In order to make that idea workable, many features would need to be changed so that you can be the `hero'. Making something realistic simply for the sake of being realistic is a better design philosophy for a simulation than a video game. XCOM thrives when the 'realistic' elements intersect with what the player understands as being fair. For instance, a marine caught out-of-cover is dead meat whilst a marine behind full cover is safe. Suppressing an enemy and/or flanking them is the best method of attack. Instead of building on these rules, XCOM focuses on features which obfuscate them. ""Your guys are getting hit constantly behind full cover? Best to camp in a corner of the map until they decide to come to you"". ""You're not on the exact tile line of the enemy when trying to flank? Tough luck then, you have exactly the same chance to hit as if you were in front of them."" 

It's not a bad game by any means, but it's a very frustrating experience that I do not recommend to the casual player. Each component of the game is well done but interact with each other poorly, making for an inconsistent experience. I quit and came back several times, remembering one or two good experiences from earlier sessions but always finding it just wasn't worth the time. However, if you are okay with probability-based games then it may be worth picking up on a sale.",1705763333,1706552700,False,2,0,0.498907119035720825,0,True,False,False

XCOM: Enemy Unknown stands tall as a strategic triumph, seamlessly merging turn-based tactics with an enthralling storyline. The game's strategic depth is commendable, immersing players in a global defense against an alien invasion. While its difficulty spikes may challenge some players, they add a layer of intensity to the overall experience.

The game excels in creating an immersive atmosphere, skillfully blending sci-fi elements with tactical gameplay. Visually and narratively cohesive, it draws players into the intense fight against extraterrestrial threats. However, occasional graphical glitches and mission environment repetitiveness slightly diminish the overall immersion.

XCOM introduces an innovative character customization and perma-death system, injecting personal stakes into each soldier's journey.

It comes mostly to the battles. It's the moment where all your soldiers miss their shots so that the enemy can kill your soldier on first try. Or the Panicked state which is just pure bs. Or when they spawn from the direction where you are not covered. Or just the spawning itself - spawning on the go makes it way more difficult to plan properly ahead. Outside of battles, it's the constant choosing which country to help. It feels like devs wanted to add another layer to the game but sadly this makes the experience just worse.

You have to manage everything from resources to panic levels to making sure your troops come back in one piece after a battle gone wrong.
For first time players,play on the lowest difficulty and check out the community guide if you need any help.

The tactical gameplay, featuring regular danger for every character involved, does give the overall feeling of intensity and valor displayed. The decisions made as the campaign progresses all matter. And there's no real ""best"" approach either, as most choices will have you leaving something unexplored, or progress the story beyond the point of no return.
Gotta praise the gameplay some more, as the strategic placement of your troops matters. Their skills and equipment matter, as well as their morale and experience in the story.
Your base of operations also receives notable advancement, allowing for a customized approach to each run, or just a relatively unique experience for your big playthrough.

It is somewhat difficult, so keep that in mind, as you decide on the next strategically-inclined title to jump into.

[list]
[*]Almost everything you do requires many days to complete, almost to excess
[*]You're always playing catch up with money, materials, research, panic levels -- and there's really not much you can do about it. You're required to be exhaustingly deliberate with the tiny budget you're given.
[*]I noticed gear would still be on an injured soldier, and I couldn't find a way to get into that soldiers inventory to swap their things onto a fresh one.
[*]For someone like me, the constraint on doing much of anything in the base for so long was unenjoyable. After every mission you come back to base, nothing has changed and there are no more actions that can be taken until the next in-game month.

[quote][b]Field Operations[/b][/quote]

[*]Controls take a little getting used to but aren't terrible
[*]Accuracy is either hit or miss, even if the weapon being used fires multiple shots. I'd have liked to see something more like Valkyria Chronicles, where each individual shot can be a hit or a miss.
[*]I found in a majority of missions that stacking mostly Assault classes on the team was the way to go. They're fast, can still shoot after dashing, and can avoid overwatch shots, letting you get right in the enemies faces and unload on them with very little risk.
[*]There are objectively correct decisions to make on the skill trees for your soldiers. I feel it would have been better if both decisions were tactically sound choices, rather than one clearly outshining the other.
[*]I'd have liked a different method of ranking up soldiers. Not only is losing your high ranking soldiers a setback, but to then have to hand hold a new recruit through a few missions is tedious. Perhaps a buildable training facility that unlocks later on, that you could throw a few soldiers at a time into.

[*]The game crashed on me a few times but no major bugs. 
[*]Default difficulty seemed appropriate, perhaps a bit too easy with a little bit of planning. 
[*]I'd have liked a campaign from the Aliens as well, like Starcraft where there are story campaigns for each race. I took a glance and it looks like you can play as the aliens in multiplayer, but that's not really the same.
[*]In the end it's a decent way to kill a little time, and I'm intrigued enough to look into the other entries of this IP at some point.

It has a few bugs and can lack proper scaling from time to time, but it is a diamond in the rough. Xcom 2 perfected the formula and you should definitely buy that if your computer can run it. 

Good luck Commander. Not every soldier is your best soldier.

[b] The Positives [/b]

+ Smooth Turn Base Game Mechanics
+ Excellent Voice Acting/Soundtrack
+ Wide Range Of Unit Customization 

[b] The Negatives [/b]

- Awful roll of the dice chances of your characters attacking successfully majority of the time.
- Awful Autosaving feature.
- No Microphone Online Voice Setting For Multiplayer.

[b] Singleplayer Aspect [/b]

You play the commander for the secretive global military force called the ""Extraterrestrial Combat Force"" otherwise known as XCOM which is ran by an elite society of shadowy figures that run the world which are only known as ""The Council"". You start with a handful of weak units that get progressively stronger the more you play through the game. After you complete or fail a mission you will be brought back to your underground secret base will you be given some time to improve your units fighting capability's as well as expanding your base of operations. The longer you play the harder it gets as the enemy's eventually fade out from being easy to kill to hard to destroy tank like beings that eat up your soldiers like an appetizer. 

[b] Multiplayer Aspect [/b]

The only multiplayer aspect of this game is a 1v1 with another friend because trying to queue for a 1v1 with a random just isn't going to happen since the game's multiplayer part is dead. If you can find a friend to play with you will be given the choice to fully customize your units and what they are. You are given a set of points which you are allowed to spend a certain amount creating your team. You are not limited to just humans you can also buy aliens as well to spice up the gameplay a little bit. After you both select what units you will be battling with you will select a map and start the match. If you are lucky you should be able to fight your friend till only team remains standing. If you are unlucky like my however some match's will never be finished on account of how the turn screen just freezes and never continues.

[b] The Games Value [/b]

This game is a must buy for any RTS lovers out there looking to waste 30+ hours of there life fighting an opponent using loaded dice. Certainly give it a buy if it goes on sale.

The expansion adds new mechanics such as genetic modification of your soldiers, and attuning your soldiers to use mechs in deployments. There's also a new enemy faction & mechanic that gets introduced. 

The base building/management aspect is still just as fun. Having things go your way feels really good in these games because you feel your progression in multiple layers (in fights, base management, research & development, gear & global defense upgrades etc).

A bit buggy here and there -- might've been due to the uncapped framerate. I crashed like around 10 times and reaction shots were VERY unsynced sometimes. The UI also just feels delayed and a bit consoleified compared to the first game. Hoping the sequel to this game has a more responsive UI.

Enemy Unknown, I give a thumbs up. On easy mode, it's not so STUPIDLY IMPOSSIBLE as to be unenjoyable. In fact, I liked it a lot, and the way it turned out ending for me was incredible (a guy that I had arbitrarily nicknamed ""Hero"" some 40 hours prior ended up shaking off mind control just in time to kill the enemy boss and save the planet!). 

After that fun experience, I eagerly started Enemy Within.  Up to a point, it was even BETTER. There were new objectives that added some variety: gather ""Meld"" from the landing sites, use it to augment your troops either with bio-upgrades or mech upgrades. Do anti-terrorism missions against some human alien sympathizers.  Other than the fact that research seemed to be A MILLION TIMES SLOWER than in Enemy Unknown, it was all good.  Then came the base infiltration, and within a couple of hours, I uninstalled the goddamn game.

The base infiltration is not a mission you can skip.  The way it goes down is this: after some cutscenes of seeming humans sabotaging stuff and attacking the people next to them in XCOM HQ, you find about three of your normal troops and a couple of low-level NPCs taking on a formidable but not unbeatable alien force.  You lose the NPCs in the process, but you defeat the first wave.  Some reinforcements arrive, including some more NPCs and one of your main troops.  But now the alien attack is RIDICULOUS.  It's three of those floater discs and the drones that repair them, plus some other crap.  After the first fiasco, I reloaded a prior save and started the whole scenario over again, fought my way cleanly to this round (still lost the NPCs, oh well) and set my troops up in cover with overwatch on.  Here come the aliens... EVERY ONE OF MY DAMN TROOPS MISSED THEIR REACTION SHOT.  Got one of the floaters down to 1 HP, then EVERY TROOP MISSED THEIR SHOT AFTER THAT, even with 85% and up chance to hit.  Meanwhile, all my troops are taking MASSIVE damage, up to 16 HP down on my tank.  OK, well I'll keep going.  Next round, I'm gonna start by taking down that floater with 1 HP.  NOPE!  Everyone missed, again in spite of 85-97% hit chances.  Are you kidding me?  

And I already knew from the last failed attempt that this was only round 2 of about 5 or 6, and the last round was going to include multiple commanders who can put huge HP shields EVERY TURN on the enemy and can mind-control (i.e. steal from me) my own troops.  It's absurd.  

At it's best, this game is an action-management game where you are -- except on the easiest difficulty setting -- always at a pretty severe disadvantage.  But at its worst, including in this HQ invasion scenario, it's just frustrating and the opposite of fun.  Watch your troops miss every shot, nullifying all your best-laid tactical plans, while the enemy gets 7 extra HP per turn from shields and your own troops get turned into enemy zombies or mind-controlled to fight against you.

Screw this.

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
[list]
[*]Thankfully the game allowed me to play around with base expansions and side missions while ignoring the main quest.This allowed me to level up the base without getting too stressed. This sort of freedom is always appreciated.
[*]I gave all my soldiers pawn star names. It was entertaining to see some of them gain nicknames and climb the ranks to become Colonel. 
[*]The game offered a research path called Shivs which I never used. Additionally, it also provided a path to using laser weaponry. Multiple progression paths like these were most appreciated, even though I never used some of them.
[*]Gameplay options to reduce difficulty were welcome.
[/list]
[h2]Cons:[/h2]
[list]
[*]There was an issue with the manual save system. After about 20 manual saves, new save files were not being created. I had to overwrite my older manual saves.
[*]Autosaves did not function correctly, loading them would load a point several hours prior to the current mission and so ultimately they were unreliable.
[*]The concept that XCoM is strapped for cash is ridiculous. If humanity loses the war, it will be due to meagre funding.
[*]Useful camera rotation feature. However, it has only 4 angles and in internal spaces it failed to display positioning clearly.
[*]The game did not allow deciding the squaddie’s class. That is assigned automatically and based on a ruleset that is never revealed.
[*]There is only one way of playing this game: edge forward meticulously about 6 tiles at a time (on overwatch, which incidentally always misses). Don’t dash forward as enemies will randomly spawn at the most inconvenient places every single time.
[*]So many UFO shootings and forced landings; so many panic reduction missions and so many extraction missions. The game is grindy, probably to pad out the length of the game.
[*]The mystery surrounding the story is what kept me progressing. The gameplay was frustrating and I was glad each encounter was over.
[*]There is never any satisfaction of a well executed plan. All plans fail, every single  mission.
[*]There is no scouting information on the location of the mission to decide what squad mates and equipment to bring. All those XCoM satellites are just idling in orbit.
[*]Snipers and Heavies not being able to shoot or fire rockets after moving to cover is a trash implementation. Only serves to pad out the length of the game.
[*]None of the reaction shots or overwatch shots hit; all of that strategy and careful positioning felt pointless.
[*]I took a break from this game years ago (at the 40% mark) as it was so painful to play. I resumed playing recently to see if I could at least finish it to get my money’s worth.
[*]The final mission does not match the rest of the game. The other missions are shorter in length. The final mission is simply a challenge gauntlet of all the previous enemies encountered. My squad was severely weakened at the end allowing only a slim opportunity to achieve victory.
[*]Why is it that 3D action games with sci-fi guns work so well, but turn-based games with sci-fi guns fail so hard? Perhaps it's because guns are too powerful to balance in a turn based setting.
[*]Turns out that the 2nd game renders all the player effort in this game obsolete.
[*]There are specific builds and upgrades that are essential, e.g if you get stuck in a level, all the online advice will be to use a particular set of builds as if they are obvious; they are not.
[*]I was able to push through the game with my squad builds but they were suddenly not good enough for the final battle.
[*]There are certainly entertaining concepts here such as: base management, research management, procurement, squad customization, but this game is so frustrating. I have read that the 2nd game adds timers on top of these frustrations! I held off on buying XCoM 2 as I had a bad hunch about this game; turns out that was well founded. I can’t envision going through these frustrations all over again under the guillotine of a timer.
[/list]
[h2]Advice:[/h2]
[list]
[*]Seek out a sleek internet guide for the game. There is a fixed way to play this game that new players wouldn’t know about. So follow the guides for the best squad builds and research paths. Play the game if you must, but avoid the slog.

Wouldn’t wish the tedium of this game on my worst unknown enemy.

The game looks great. Its armors, weapons, planes, aliens. It definitely achieved the action figure look that they were going for. Soldiers have voice lines and personality now. Ground combat is intense, far closer ranged than general combat in UFO and TFTD. 

Psychic powers are nerfed so that the user needs line of sight to the victim and they can only grab one at a time. 

UFO weapons are fixed so that your planes are always in range, no matter what weapon they have. Which makes the new Firestorm with high health much more useful against the bigger UFOs. It also helps that ""fuel capacity/range"" isn't a factor.

Cinematic story cutscenes effectively drive the plot along with great chemistry between the three XCOM departments. Plot is actually centered around psychic powers. Aliens are better developed compared to UFO Defense, with it being extremely clear why they came to earth.

""Ant Farm"" base looks cool. Autopsies  and live interrogations all give you a benefit, in the form of new items, or research credits and intact plasma weapons. 

Alien weapons break when the user dies. You have to make the effort of tazing aliens if you want to get plasma weapons.

Tons of character customization options compared to UFO which had none except for naming. While limiting, exclusive class abilities give each soldier a defined role on the battlefield. And while limiting, class exclusive weapons mean, yes, you will need to use things other than laser rifles and heavy plasmas.

Yes, I'm talking to YOU. Reading this review.

BAD: 

The game feels somewhat limited, especially on the Geoscape or Mission Control. You can't buy scientists, you get them from missions. Engineers can be ""bought"" with workshops. Only one plane can attack a UFO at a time and UFOs appear according to a script. 

You can't have multiple transports that respond to simultaneous missions. Abduction missions screw you over in terms of panic. The five point panic bars means ignoring a country even once can easily have them leave the council.

Geoscape panic management is entirely dependent on getting satellites. Because Abductions happen in countries without satellites, covering most of the world with them significantly reduces your missions. The AI doesn't give you more UFO missions or Council missions to compensate.

If you are able to, you can avoid putting satellites on one continent. You can still get some abduction missions that way, and the country you don't go to won't panic. But, again, it's like the AI realizes it can't screw you over with panic now, so abduction missions become very rare.

Many, many restrictions compared to UFO, without mods or Second Wave options. 
Only 4 and then 6 soldiers. 
Weapons entirely restricted by class. 
Soldiers of the same class get the exact same stat progression and stats are capped at Colonel rank. 
Only ever one inventory slot for any unit that's not a Support. Units can need certain perks to be able to fire more than once.

Leveling up low-rank soldiers in mid/late game is very difficult. 
They have low health and aim, and few perks. 
Primary enemies at this point have small to large innate defense even before factoring flight defense bonus and cover. 
Weak enemies become scarce, save for Thin Men in Council Missions. 
Because only kills earn XP, you find yourself babying the enemies so the low rank can get the kill. 

It's a much easier time if the low-rank is a psychic, because Mindfray ignores cover/defense, and Mutons, Elites and Heavy Floaters have low Will. 

UGLY: 

I absolutely hate the panic check system. 
In UFO and TFTD, panic checks happened when morale gets low after psi attacks or losing many soldiers in a short space of time. 
Here, there is no morale bar. 
Panic checks happen when you shoot 2 out of 3 Muton types, take any damage, or a soldier dies. 
If one soldier fails a panic check, others also get a panic check. Because the Will stat starts out low, expect to see it a lot, especially on the harder difficulties. 

Combine this with the fewer soldiers, with each of them having one attack per turn without certain perks, you have a domino effect where a string of bad rolls gets your entire squad wiped because these hand-picked, elite soldiers are freaking out because one of them took 1 damage from Acid Spit. Long War doesn't make it much better.

Conclusion: Truly a fantastic game. I had never heard of XCOM until Firaxis took their crack at it. Thank you for introducing me to a fantastic series. Yes, it has problems, but even some of the limitations made some kind of sense. This is a game about following the spirit of XCOM, not the letter.

Can't believe I missed out on XCOM for so many years. Every time I read strategy games reviews, I always see at least one mention XCOM. I'm very sure it was a revolutionary game of the strategy genre at the time and it still holds up even until this day.

The gameplay is excellent, and I can see that many other strategy games that came out later were inspired by XCOM's system. Very hardcore and satisfying progression that really does require the player to think, do the correct moves and suffer the consequences from errors. Everything need to be extremely carefully planned, from the soldiers in the field to the resource management and upgrades in the ship.
Really crazy to see the probability working in this game with soldiers missing shots with 90%+ hit probability on enemies just 1 square ahead. Now I can see where the 99% hit probability meme comes from lol
The controls on PC are excellent and make great use of the mouse and keyboard, including hotkeys and the mouse side buttons. It's actually the first time I see a game make use of the mouse side buttons, wasn't expecting to see it being used in any game, especially in one that is 11 years old. Really impressive how everything was really well done.
Game took 32 hours to beat playing on a mix of normal and easy difficulty.

XCOM is a great example that a good game is good forever, even years after.
I had a blast playing it and could't put it down. I got this game for less than $1 but would pay full price for it any time.

It is a tough game as you have to balance a lot of things and make important decisions that impact your game. There are two main things to manage and plan, on the battlefield and your base. If you fail on the battlefield you lose people; if you fail at your base management, well....let's just say it is not going to end well. Multiplayer is almost non-exsistent sadly, but you can ask for matches and when finally get into one they are really fun. The multiplayer is like chess, but luck is involved.

The game is a remake of the classic X-COM: UFO Defense, but with updated graphics, gameplay, and story. The game puts you in charge of a secret organization called XCOM, which is tasked with defending Earth from an alien invasion. You have to manage your base, research alien technology, train and equip your soldiers, and send them on missions around the world. The game is challenging and rewarding, as you have to make tough decisions and deal with the consequences of your actions. The game also has a multiplayer mode, where you can pit your squad against another player’s in a head-to-head battle.

The game’s strengths are its immersive atmosphere, its strategic depth, and its replay value. The game creates a sense of tension and urgency, as you never know when and where the aliens will strike next. The game also gives you a lot of freedom and customization options, as you can choose your base location, your research priorities, your soldier classes, and your tactics. The game has a lot of variety and randomness, as each mission is different and each alien encounter is unpredictable. The game also has a high difficulty level, which forces you to think carefully and adapt to changing situations. The game is not for the faint of heart, as you will face many losses and setbacks, and you will have to deal with the permanent death of your soldiers. The game is not linear, as you can choose different paths and outcomes, and the game has multiple endings depending on your performance. The game also has a lot of content and modes, as you can play the main campaign, the standalone expansion Enemy Within, the DLC Slingshot, or the multiplayer mode.

The game’s weaknesses are its technical issues, its interface, and its balance. The game has some bugs and glitches, such as crashes, freezes, and graphical errors. The game also has some performance problems, such as long loading times and frame rate drops. The game’s interface is not very user-friendly, as it can be confusing, cluttered, and unresponsive. The game also has some balance issues, such as some classes, skills, and items being overpowered or underpowered, some missions being too easy or too hard, and some enemies being too predictable or too unfair.

Overall, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a game that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys strategy games, sci-fi games, or challenging games. The game is a masterpiece of game design, as it blends different genres and elements in a seamless and engaging way. The game is a tribute to the original X-COM, but also a modern and innovative game that stands on its own. The game is a game that will test your skills, your nerves, and your emotions, as you fight for the fate of humanity against a ruthless alien threat. The game is a game that will keep you hooked for hours, days, and weeks, as you explore, experiment, and experience its rich and diverse gameplay. The game is a game that you will not regret playing, as it will leave you with a sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, and awe. The game is a game that deserves a score of 9.5 out of 10.",1700849607,1700849607,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I do have one major complaint though: Much like the original the late game is pure tedium. This time instead of battleship spam and nonstop infiltration missions it decides that a small scout should have an Ethereal, 3 Elite Mutons, and 3 Heavy Floaters and; and if the ship is larger? Have fun with 10+ Elite Mutons and a Sectopod! I'm not saying there shouldn't be late game enemies on ships in the late game but when every ship including small scouts have an elite strike force in it then it's just not worth doing the crash site missions.",1699813336,1699813336,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

XCOM enemy within gets stuck somewhere after the turtorial, I think. It is hard to know when the tutorial ends and the real gameplay begins.

-- To few options in settings for the user. A couple of examples;
-Quick change selected team member is hard coded to be ""tab+shift"" which also opens steam overlay. 
-Can not turn of the tideous cut scenes, that you are sick off after the waayy to long tutorial. 
No way to turn of action scenes when opening doors or running fast etc. So there is slow motion action captures all the time.
-- Auto saves is not default. For a unstable game like this it really should.
-- Clunky controls.
-- Can not zoom out enough. This makes it harder to use long range weapons. And with the clunky controls on top of that, every time aiming a shot with a rocket launcher f.i. is a horrible experience.

This game is a poorly programmed version of the old good XCOM - UFO defence, with so many cut scenes and zoomed in actions scenes the player is unsure if it is really playing or just going threw a story game like the walking dead game series. The atmosphere from the old game is not here either. Some of the ideas from the original game is still excisteing and even built upon like how you can build satellites that covers parts of the world.  But the whole concept with an covert multiinternational unit get thrown out the window after 30 min of gameplay when aliens attack major cities and it is sent live on news channels. 
But this is not even the worst part. No the worst part is that the feeling of the game is gone. Probebly thanks to the bulky weapons and futuristic armor. Someone, probebly an market analyst, thought it looked cool, but it ripped the sould out of the game.

The difficulty of the game is quite high on classic+ difficulties, even without Ironman.  Overall a must play for anyone who loves strategy games. 

It will take more than 150 hours to get all achievements.  There are several challenging achievements.
- A continental fellow: requires at least 5 runs and the achievement is bit buggy.  The achievement did not pop for me after my latest run.  Then it pops after I loaded all five saves and watch all endings again. 
- Ironman classic+:  this is the best achievement in my opinion.  Definitely a big challenge and not recommended in the first run.
- impossible:  not as difficult as ironman classic+ since save / load is allowed.  still difficult especially for the first two months.

The turn base is well revisited in this game, very dynamic and fun. However, it has a major flaw that is that enemies are ""triggered"" once they are spotted, as if the fog of war was removed for you and them simultaneously. The consequence is that you can't ambush each enemy independently, read their movement and so on, they immediately take position once you spotted them. This severely limits the strategy in the game and it falls back to a series of small tactical encounters that are very enjoyable but repetitive. 

I prefer the original X-COM series for their depth and difficulty during battles. 

X-COM 2 is a bad copy of this game, and I recommend X-COM over its sequel.

That's the kind of affection players develop for XCOM: Enemy Unknown.

This game is a must-play for anyone who appreciates strategy and tactics. It's a profound experience that keeps you engaged for hours on end. The gameplay is compelling, offering choices and customisation that make each playthrough feel unique. You can delve as deep as you want, immersing yourself in a modern twist on the X-Com legacy.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown captures the essence of probability. It's a game that teaches you that probability is just a number, and in this world, probability is anything but predictable. You'll quickly learn that God doesn't play dice, but XCOM does.

The game may appear as a simple turn-based strategy, but it's so much more. Whether you're a rookie or a seasoned player, XCOM: Enemy Unknown offers challenging and satisfying gameplay. While it might have some quirks and a few bugs, its allure remains intact, even after all these years.

The game is as good as ever, and its graphical style, though slightly cartoonish, still holds up well. And, for those looking to expand their experience, the ""Enemy Within"" DLC is a must-buy. It enriches the gameplay and fills the gaps, making the entire XCOM experience even more captivating.

I really want to recommend this game.  I love the game play, the soldiers, the weapons, etc.  However, the game locks up while in combat mode so often that it is rather frustrating to play since you have to save OFTEN so as not to repeat all your actions over again.  The lock ups that I've seen seem to occur on the last team member's turn.  The camera still works, but the keyboard and action buttons you can click on do not respond.  The only way out (since ESC doesn't work) is to SHIFT-TAB and get back to the desktop and kill the game via the Task Manager.

Many games have changed their core principles in order to earn an extra buck with a different audience, but XCOM keeps it real. Unrelenting, cool, and satisfying (but only because of how brutal the losses are).

The game does have it's shortcomings, however. Enemies may randomly spawn during a mission, and I'm left wondering about some of their design choices. For example, the unmanned weapons platform that can replace a soldier in your squad is criminally inaccurate, and it lacks the ability to use cover. The UFO vs. XCOM aircraft system is lame.

I have loved ‘XCOM: Enemy Unknown’ since I first played it on Console so I had no doubt I’d enjoy following up on this classic.  As always though time and experience concern me and found myself with trepidation at starting this game up again.  Was my hesitance well founded?  Let’s discuss!

Welcome Back, Commander:  Anyone who doesn’t know XCOM Enemy Unknown is a turn based squad tactics game that pits your team of expendable soldier’s verses an alien invasion.  At the core there isn’t much to explain; your soldiers alternate taking turns against AI controlled opponents in a atmosphere heavy but story light world that is challenging and rewarding.  There are a number of missions with stories in them but most of the game is going to be spent shooting down UFOs and clearing out towns under attack.  The reason a lot of this doesn’t sound too exciting is that this game was kind of what launched the renaissance of the tactics genre.

Tactically Timeless:  One thing I want to touch on is the level of modding on this game.  I did not play with any mods this time around but there are pretty much mods for anything you could want, it is truly a unique experience every game you start with modding.  The game also has almost endless content, even though the core game only has 4 classes you can unlock Robot assistants, the psychic sub-class and just play around with many different builds of characters.

Brought here to Lead, not Read:  My criticisms might be a bit more than I’d like but this comes from someone who absolutely loves this game but I have to acknowledge that most, if not all, of these criticisms probably have been addressed through mods of some kind.  If I had to settle on the one biggest issue is the customization of characters, there are effectively 3 things you cannot change (or determine, outside of re-rolling); Nationality, Sex and Class.  I get the intent to giving the characters a since of self but you let me change their voice, name and racial background…but changing their nationality is too much?  The second biggest issue I had was the inverted difficulty, I’m sure this isn’t the case on harder difficulties or for someone who doesn’t spend a dozen hours getting their soldiers exactly where I wanted them but it was kind of annoying that the beginning missions were the hardest.  You also can’t customize your SHIV and that would have been a nice addition.  Finally, movement placement can be a big pain, especially around ledges and when you accidently misclick a move it can be a death sentence for that soldier.

Overall, this game still holds up very well, though admittedly not as polished and effective as XCOM2 is but I still very much enjoyed the game.  I’d recommend it to anyone who (for some reason) has never played it and likes tactics style games.  Highly recommended, enjoy!",1694967680,1694967720,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have never  beaten it but I don't think I will need too because the amount of content it has  is amazing (and it was amazing even before I installed countless files, changed several words, and clicked many buttons) hell, I am insane because I actually jumped the shark and swapped straight from EU to LW, without even trying out EW. I have played several other games inspired by and modifying how this game works (othercide, the sequels to XCOM, pheonix point{which is one of my favs on this list} just to name four) and while they are all cool and different, none of them are as fun as this one. This XCOM nails all of the attributes solidly, it has great music, setting and story is [METAL GEAR] solid and a great catalyst for all of the action sequences, gameplay is great in every mode, whether you like the base maintenance, tactical combat, or even the air combat{that one is actually kinda boring but to each their own} it is fun to play and keeps you on your toes, and it has so much mod-ability, you don't even need to use nexus mods to mod it, just open up the .ini and get to work. (there is a steam guide that will help you do that) oh, and uh, while I have never played multiplayer (because of my modding) I have played a lot of chess, so if you do play multiplayer (for whatever reason) I think it would be fun, if you like chess (you probably would if you like this game anyways, the only difference between the multiplayer and the singleplayer is who is on the other side of the table, same rule applies to chess. singleplayer chess players have and will continue to exist despite anyone's saying that they don't.) just guessing here, I have never played the multiplayer, but I might try it out (if I ever remove all of my mods, unlikely.)

It's a lot more ""gamey"" as opposed to the sim-like original.  The campaign is more story driven.  The game is more simple overall.  You're encourage to build up a small elite squad as opposed to a large roster of cannon fodder like the original.  The bad thing about that is you simply can't afford to lose a high level trooper so there's a big incentive to save-scum.  This is especially true of harder difficulties and the Long War mod, which is much harder than the base game.  

One other thing I don't really like is the tendency for many different alien types on the same map.  The original was more thematic - for instance a given UFO would contain only sectoids or mutons rather than a menagerie of like 6 aliens.  I think they missed an opportunity to allow you to bring different weapons and tactics to different fights where the aliens would be fielding different combinations of units.  Instead, it's common for them to field EVERY type of alien in the same battle.

Where the game shines: 
1)The story is generally interesting and has been mostly copied 1-to-1 in almost all other games made within the genre. I'll go into more detail on the story toward the end with spoilers 
2) mechanics are smooth and deeply enjoyable
3) customisation option cause you to form bonds with those under your command. 
4) interesting base building elements mean you can play slightly differently every time!
5) maintaining public order is of importance! If the people start to panic your mysterious benefactor may loose faith in the project and pull support
6) Difficulty is enjoyable and well scaled with time!
7) game environments are unique and well designed! From open rural areas to the hearts of cities or even inside UFOs! 
8) the Game concept is fantastic and perfectly well executed. You're a commander looking down on your people, during your turn you issue commands. Move here! Shoot this! Keep a look out and shoot anything that moves (called overwatch)! The map is shrouded in a fog of war, if your people can't see it, you can't see it! 
9) it has an interesting mechanic where you have to scramble aircraft of your own to intercept and crash hostile UFOs. You then have to mobilise your team to kill the UFOs occupants and claim the tech for the project. 
10) multiple objectives! In some missions you have to:
- Just kill all the hostiles
- in some you have to protect and evacuate civilians from a war zone. The aliens may engage in terrorism in an attempt to break humanities spirit (because if recent history is anything to go by that always works so well on humans *sarcastic eye roll*)
- Protect and escort people of interest back to HQ
- Capture grounded UFOs and their tech. Its similar to just killing hostiles but you have to be careful not to damage the valuable tech you plan to capture
- side quests: taking an alien back to base alive for further testing

Where the game falls short:
1) as joked about by other reviews, 99% accuracy isn't as certain as it may seem! It sometimes feels like you get unlucky more than just chance should allow. 
2) There are a variety of awesome environments to play in but the UFO assaults specifically can get kind of tedious. This is causes by two factors: 
- There are only 7 UFOs and they are same every single time and their layout is just generally predictable. 
- the UFO's layout means you sometimes have to search for the bad guys more than I'd really like
3) while corrected in Xcom 2, Xcom 1 is missing some vital customisation options for its soldiers. Most notably, nationality and gender. It could be argued this is realistic, but I'd really prefer as much control over customising my people as reasonably possible.  

Xcom is amazing! There are so many games like it these days but honestly you just can't beat true Xcom! Would very highly recommend it to any who enjoys tactical or strategy games. Xcom so consistently hits the mark and in my view is still an amazing game to this day! Its no wounder it has given birth to a great sequel and a whole genre of near identical games lovingly made proudly in its shadow. 

A deep introduction into the story:
*** Beware of major spoilers for the first 3 quarters of the game ***
[spoiler] Xeno-scum attack Earth, our home, and your job is to make sure either we are victories or that by the time the dust settles their victory tastes as bitter as defeat. As you engage the hostiles you collect their kit and most interestingly the bodies of those you take down in battle. This is where it gets really interesting! Calling upon the greatest minds of the generation you reverse engineer their tech to serve your own purposes, kitting your soldiers out with the latest in Xeno killing weapons and conduct autopsies on the bodies. They seem to quite clearly share human genetic material. Perhaps all life in the universe is in someway terrestrial in nature? Evidence of a great creator like written about in religious texts maybe? perhaps there is just something intrinsic about all life the causes them to follow an near identical genetic path? ... Or *shudders to think* these lifeforms have been made using your fellow man? What do they want? Why are they here? As you fight on more you get hints of a strange power. Psionics! These beings have some sort of biological or technological power unlike anything we've seen before! We must harness it, control it, weld it if we hope to win this. You set up a research project to augment your own people to use this power. Changing them into something slightly different. maybe slightly less human? A devils advocate in your rag tag team of brilliant minds can't help but ponder ""Are we on the same path as them? Were they once just like us? were they confronted with this power like we were and craved harnessing it for themselves? If we continue to follow this path will we become just like our oppressors?"". Maybe if things were different you'd hear those warning out, but desperate times call for desperate measures, if this is a mistake we'll have to cross that bridge when we get there...

XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a perfect blend of strategy, tactics, and sci-fi. The game is very immersive and engaging, as I felt like I was really leading a secret organization against a terrifying alien threat. The game has a lot of replay value, as I can customize my soldiers, choose different research paths, and face different scenarios and enemies.

The game is also very challenging and rewarding, as I had to make tough decisions, plan carefully, and deal with the consequences of my actions. XCOM: Enemy Unknown has a lot of depth and variety, as I can use different weapons, abilities, and items to suit my playstyle. This game also has a lot of tension and suspense, as I never knew what kind of alien I would encounter next, or when they would launch a surprise attack on my base. The game has a lot of atmosphere and emotion, as I cared about my soldiers, mourned their deaths, and celebrated their victories.

- Fun skills and soldier progression system

- Maps feel small

- To-hit % is completely out of wack. You may have clear view of an enemy and have 15% chance to hit. Infamous 99% misses and several under 20% hits. It just feels weird
- No base building, just satelite deployment... and you loose your satelite if you loose a region?!
- Soldier loadouts are also ""peculiar"". Wish I knew a soldier needs to throw away his grenade so he can equip armor. Feels like a stop-gap mechanic, as if accessories and inventory were an after thought just before the game's launch.
- Unskipable tutorial/cinematics

2. It has a modest learning curve, but sufficient challenge on higher difficulty levels
3. user interface is simple but effective
4. Upgrades are readily achieved, so resource collection/research/construction are manageable even on harder levels

CON
1. It can be a little predictable and focus is on sniper units which are the main damage dealers in the game,
2. You do have plan abit, but the AI is a little predictable
3. The maps are abit small (but necessary to keep each mission in a reasonable time frame)

Overall it was a fun game, not too difficult but not too easy. But ultimately snipers are the key in this game.

XCOM was my first foray into the world of turn-based strategy, and thus I certainly don't have the knowledge to claim it as the best in its genre. However, I can confidently state that my experience with this game has been exceptional.

The sci-fi plot revolves around an alien invasion threatening life on Earth. We assume the role of XCOM, a secret military organization tasked with countering these alien incursions. While the game doesn't prioritize narrative as its core focus, the storyline, though straightforward, unfolds in an engaging manner, presenting intriguing elements that demand constant reflection. The narrative build-up also leads to a pleasantly surprising twist at the end.

XCOM sets itself apart with its depth of gameplay, offering management mechanics as well. We can expand our base by digging underground and constructing new structures, hiring scientists and engineers to conduct research and develop weapons, armor, vehicles, and more. Managing global panic is crucial to secure monthly funding for our project. Refusing to intervene in alien attacks can lead to losing support from allied nations, reducing our available resources. This aspect of the game requires careful planning to ensure long-term success.

The control room, represented by an enormous globe, stands out as one of the most intriguing features. Activating it initiates monitoring of alien activity on Earth, with every second representing a day of research. Managing time wisely becomes crucial for completing projects and research since they require real-time progress. The presence of alien activities necessitates our immediate intervention, which is carried out through captivating turn-based battles.

The combat system, while turn-based, offers a variety of challenges and strategic opportunities. Instead of commanding large armies, we lead a group of up to six soldiers. Customizing equipment, including weapons, armor, and accessories, adds an additional layer of tactical involvement.

The post-combat reward system is well-structured: by recovering alien corpses and weapons, we can exploit alien technology to our advantage, reproducing advanced weapons or developing new devices. The ability to engage UFOs in flight adds an exciting component, with vehicle and weapon choices being crucial for mission success.

While XCOM is an outstanding title, some technical imperfections are evident. Occasionally, soldiers may aim at an alien but shoot in the opposite direction, still hitting the target. These moments can be amusing but are clearly flaws in the game.

Another issue lies with the BERSERKER, a type of enemy that causes game slowdowns while walking. Fortunately, this bug does not affect missions.

In conclusion, XCOM proves to be an exceptional experience and comes highly recommended for turn-based strategy enthusiasts and even those with experience only in real-time strategy games. The title is equally perfect for newcomers to the genre. The depth of gameplay, management mechanics, and thrilling battles make XCOM an engaging and captivating gaming experience.",1486907017,1690829713,True,2,0,0.554367184638977051,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★½

XCOM Enemy Unknown is a game that stands as a remarkable testament to the enduring legacy of turn-based strategy games. With its intricate gameplay mechanics, engaging story, and immersive atmosphere, it successfully reignites the excitement of classic alien invasion narratives while delivering a solid foundation for the franchise's future installments.

One of the most commendable aspects of XCOM Enemy Unknown is its strategic depth. As the commander of an elite paramilitary organization tasked with defending Earth from extraterrestrial threats, players must carefully manage resources, deploy troops, and make difficult decisions that have far-reaching consequences. The blend of base management, research, and tactical combat creates a sense of urgency and tension that keeps players on the edge of their seats.

The game's combat mechanics are particularly noteworthy. The turn-based battles provide a satisfying balance between strategic planning and unpredictable outcomes. Each encounter presents players with tough choices and tactical dilemmas, forcing them to consider cover positions, flanking opportunities, and the effective use of various soldier classes. The sense of satisfaction that comes from executing a well-coordinated assault or narrowly escaping a deadly ambush is truly unmatched.

While XCOM Enemy Unknown excels in many areas, it falls just short of perfection. The graphics, while functional and serviceable, lack the visual polish and detail that would elevate the game to the next level. Additionally, the occasional technical hiccups and AI quirks can occasionally disrupt the immersion, albeit to a minor extent.

Nonetheless, XCOM Enemy Unknown lays the groundwork for an exceptional gaming experience. Its success in revitalizing the turn-based strategy genre is undeniable, and it paves the way for even greater adventures in subsequent titles. With its addictive gameplay loop, compelling narrative, and engaging mechanics, this game stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of strategic decision-making and tactical combat.

In summary, XCOM Enemy Unknown is a great base for things to come. While it may have a few minor shortcomings, its overall package is undeniably captivating. Fans of the genre will find themselves engrossed in the challenging battles, tense decision-making, and captivating narrative. With three and a half stars, it's a strong recommendation for both strategy enthusiasts and alien invasion aficionados alike.

With its deep tactical gameplay, challenging strategic choices, and immersive atmosphere, Enemy Unknown stands as a true gem in the realm of turn-based strategy games.

One of the standout features of XCOM: Enemy Unknown is its addictive and engaging tactical gameplay. Players assume the role of the commander of XCOM, a global defense organization tasked with defending Earth against a mysterious alien threat. The game seamlessly combines turn-based combat with strategic base management, creating a dynamic and rewarding experience. Each mission presents players with strategic choices, such as positioning their squad members, utilizing cover, and selecting the most effective abilities to counter the alien forces. The depth of tactical options and the ever-present risk-reward decisions keep players on the edge of their seat, making every encounter a thrilling and strategic endeavor.

The strategic layer of XCOM: Enemy Unknown adds another layer of depth and immersion to the gameplay. As the commander, players are responsible for managing the XCOM headquarters, researching new technologies, developing weapons and armor, and training their soldiers. The ability to customize and level up squad members, as well as build and expand the base, provides a sense of progression and personal investment. The strategic choices made outside of combat directly impact the outcome of battles, creating a cohesive and immersive gameplay loop.

Visually, XCOM: Enemy Unknown delivers a gritty and atmospheric experience. The game's environments are meticulously designed, from the desolate urban landscapes to the eerie alien structures. The attention to detail in character models, animations, and special effects adds to the immersion, capturing the intensity of the battles and the high stakes of the conflict. The sound design is equally impressive, with atmospheric soundscapes, intense combat effects, and a fitting musical score that heightens the tension and drama of the gameplay.

The narrative in XCOM: Enemy Unknown is engaging and compelling. The game combines global strategy with personal narratives of individual soldiers, creating a sense of attachment and investment in their stories. The game's well-crafted storyline unfolds through mission briefings, cutscenes, and in-game events, keeping players engaged and motivated to save humanity from the alien threat. The sense of urgency, the moral dilemmas, and the unexpected twists and turns add depth and emotional weight to the gameplay experience.

Furthermore, XCOM: Enemy Unknown offers a high level of replayability. The game features a branching campaign with multiple difficulty levels, allowing players to tailor the experience to their skill level and preferences. The procedurally generated maps, random events, and the ability to customize squads and soldiers offer endless variations and strategic possibilities. Additionally, the game's modding community provides a wealth of user-generated content, extending the longevity and enjoyment of the game even further.

In conclusion, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a strategic masterpiece that combines deep tactical gameplay, challenging choices, and an immersive atmosphere. Its addictive and engaging gameplay, alongside its visually stunning presentation and compelling narrative, make it a standout title in the turn-based strategy genre. Whether you're a fan of the XCOM franchise or a newcomer to the series, Enemy Unknown offers an unforgettable experience filled with tactical brilliance, strategic decision-making, and the thrill of defending humanity against an alien invasion. Prepare to take command, lead your squad, and save the world in the face of overwhelming odds.",1442431162,1689404094,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When this reboot game was announced, I was jazzed and hoping to snag a copy with a bonus. Imagine my surprise when I booted up Steam and my brother had gifted me a pre-order copy as a gift because he was just as jazzed about the game as I was.

11 years and many play-throughs on at least 4 different systems (PC, 360, PS3 and PS4) later, I can honestly say this is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. I am consistently presented with challenging scenarios, impossible odds, and the lure of that shiny alien tech. Every game is a mad blitz to the overseer, with the same excitement I felt as I was playing the original back in 1994 at 6 years old. Of course, I have a much firmer grasp on strategy now, but I'm still no wizard.

We all have those games where we have a special moment. For me, it was the conclusion of my first playthrough. Madeline ""The Missionary"" Roux, a sniper from Canada, ended up being my volunteer. The impact of the sacrifice made the game's gravity shift, and I have to say... I loved it.

The gameplay is pretty solid. Battling EXALT, aliens and public opinion in and of itself is a delicate balancing act. Strategy applies to more than mere combat maps. You have to strategize every step of the way. What continent should my base be on? Should I buy that Officer Training School upgrade? Would I be better served launching the satellite in France or Australia? Do I have enough interceptors to handle a large UFO? These are the decisions the Commander of the XCOM force must make.

Multiplayer is surprisingly fun, and surprisingly still up! (Which is weird, because XCOM 2's multiplayer servers are down for Windows, but still up for Linux and Mac.) The point-buy system of the multiplayer balances things out wonderfully and creates infinite strategy, a never-ending list of combinations to try, and a new thrill every time you match with someone in the lobby.

Graphics can be hauntingly beautiful in this game. Watch an Outsider emerge upon contact, or an Ethereal mind control your soldier with the highest will. Watch the car explode after being hit by a stray laser or plasma round. Take it in as the Muton beats its chest. Crap your pants the first time a Chryssalid gores an unsuspecting civillian and then... well, you know. Admire the craftsmanship that the graphics designers put into this game.

Sound is decent, and it got even better with the Enemy Within expansion. I really love the touches of the soldiers from various countries being able to respond to orders in their native languages, and the effects are top notch. The voice acting is superb, and all of the VAs did a fantastic job... even the one for Dr. Vahlen, though I have never quite pinned down if she's meant to be German, Austrian, Swiss, what have you (the accent varies occasionally).

Controls are pretty basic on PC. You point. You click. Keyboard shortcuts exist, but are largely not necessary. I do utilize a handful, but it's primarily because they line up perfectly with the keyboard macros from my day job. I can rest my hand in the same location of my keyboard in order to react. It doesn't get much simpler or more intuitive than this.

Overall, this game is a modern classic. Every serious gamer should have a strategy game in their library, and this is a stand-out choice in the genre. Those with tactical prowess and those without (like me!) can both appreciate a game that was crafted with a deep, obvious love by the developer. It's a hell of a challenge, but I don't want the 350 hours of my life I spent earning all 85 achievements back. That final achievement is my proudest gaming accomplishment, and I have no regrets (except the facepalming during my impossible campaign).

Super fun, tactical, strategic, immersive, long, and rewarding.

Not perfect, but holds up well in 2023 and represents fantastic value on sale. Still better than most of the clones that came after.

BTW, this review is for both Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within, which come packaged together. And I'd recommend playing both, in that order.

Overall they're both fun though slightly flawed games. The turn based strategy is both exciting and relaxing as you can play at your own pace. 

The base building and tech research 'mini game' is a fun diversion in the game which allows another level of strategy and customization of your characters, to whom you'll get really attached. The story is servicable if not great.


Minor Gripes:
-The camera in Enemy Unknown is fixed which is a bit annoying, but there is a mod which unlocks the camera which I'd highly recommend. Enemy Within fixes this and updates the graphics. 

-The Save Game system is obtuse. It likes to overwrite your saves. See solution below.

-Sometimes the RNG can seem a bit unfair. So save manually at the start of every map, when your characters are on the ground and you have not yet moved. Do this again *every* time you reload a save game. 

-The Engineering Build/Buy menu where you buy armor and weapons and ships etc, will tell you the materials requirement to say build one plasma rifle but does not tell you how many of said materials you already have. So you'll have to do a little menu toggling. 

-Some positions appear to have line of sight to a target but don't. Use the camera mod mentioned above to move the camera to make sure you have a shot, and you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly.


Conclusion:
Overall the complaints are minor and the gameplay is fun and engaging with good enough graphics and great immersion. Often on sale at great discounts and presents a terrific value.

It's kinda creepy in terms of atmosphere, music, and enemies, but there's also this driving heroism beneath it all as you send your soldiers down to do battle with the invaders. 

I think what I love most about this game is how you can fail a mission and still try to win. There are multiple ways to lose but most of them are a result of repeated failures. It makes everything feel open-ended, like there's still hope in spite of your losses. 

And you're never sure who's going to make it to the end. You get invested in the fates of your best soldiers. There's something grimly satisfying about fielding late-game squads and realizing only one of your original veterans remains, where once he was part of a full team of badasses who took down major foes and won critical battles together.

Fantastic turn based, squad based strategy game with a heavy dose of sci fi.
never liked these games growing up, but this one is spot on.  Definitely get the enemy within expansion pack.  Being new to the genre I play it without the expansion first, just to get the hang of it, then I play enemy within, which has many more game play elements.

Let me explain, even 11 years after launch, this game stays good and will remain a classic for the years to come.

How to have fun:
1st : you play the game, it needs 30 ish hours to finish.
2nd : you download long war, it gives you an extra 100 hours of pure fun.
3rd : you download long war rebalanced for an extra 70 hours (you got better).

Than you play other games like xcom2 (long war 2 and lwotc included), pheonix point (terror from the void included), xenonauts (and the 2nd in a short time) a little battle brothers, battletech (included roguetech) and maybe a tactical rpg like arbiter's mark.

hold up even now, won't blow your socks off but get the job done without looking dated.

The class system is pretty good with a enough depth so that you can vary your playstyles within classes.
In addition to the usual military classes, there's also a psionic power system that's pretty good in supplementing the existing classes.
Accuracy system however is unremarkable at best and irritating at worst, soldiers consistently miss shots even when they're firing on enemies standing in the open with no obstacles in between.
The game weirdly gets easier as the game progresses into the storyline as you research and engineer a medley of armours and weapons.
Controls are a mess especially when you need to switch between levels to send your character up or down, the terrain bugs out often.

Combat can sometimes be overwhelming, with more powerful enemies rapidly appearing out of nowhere. But focusing on efficient strategies and conserving resources can help turn the tide of battle.

The game is unforgiving; any wrong move can have dire consequences, making it easy to lose a battle. But the game rewards those who think carefully and use what they have wisely. Just like in LIVE DIE REPEAT, there’s a limited window of opportunity to make your last stand against the enemy while making the most out of the limited resources you have.

Overall, XCOM: Enemy Unknown provides a captivating experience that captures what made LIVE DIE REPEAT so memorable. The game not only gives you plenty of strategic depth but also offers plenty of replay value thanks to procedurally generated maps and random missions. Even after several playthroughs, the game still remains challenging and rewarding, making it one of the best tactical strategy games released in recent years.",1487363971,1685763532,True,3,0,0.470266252756118774,0,True,False,False

It is very fun for a person that likes the strategy behind games of chess mixed with a bit of chance.
Reminds me sort of like Dungeons and Dragons style game play. Doesn't matter how strong your character is, there is still a chance for failure and having to replace the character.
You get attached to members you spend time building. It can be difficult to deal with the loss so much so, some will make a save before each time they go in, just so they don't lose a character they like.

The first couple of play thru's you'll love, but there is only so much variability in the game, so after a while it gets stale. So replay ability isn't eternity, but you'll enjoy it a while. Depends on the person I guess.

[b] Sniper Class [/b] - The Sniper class is just nuts when you get them elevated in the right place which helps in later play when they get a Jet Pack so be patient in building a couple even though they are weak early on.
[b] Support Class [/b] - Medic and so important later in the game.
[b] Assault Class [/b] - Short range but seriously deadly.
[b] Heavy Class [/b] - A tank with a big Gun. Personally I don't run them. They are just not nimble enough for the way I like to play.

[b] My Preferred Load Out [/b] - 2 x Assault, 2 x Support, 1 x Sniper
[b] Late game [/b] - I don't think it matters what your load out is. I would get everyone that tested positive ranked up till my team all had Psi abilities. Then its like your in God mode and you just crush them all. That part is also fun.

I am actually getting ready to revisit the game and play thru it, see if its still enjoyable to revisit. It's been a few years, so I'm sure I'll enjoy it.
It might even make me curse myself and my choices later tonight.

If you're easily frustrated and not into role-playing being the main narrative component, this game is a bit hard to enjoy. Some frustrations I've encountered:

> This game doesn't really seem to have a story or narrative. You're just thrown into missions and the ""narrative"" is built on the skills trees, research, etc and what you choose to do, what you fail to do, etc. I noticed this when I had gotten a mission to escort some VIP, and after failing I thought ""oh, well, I guess I won't get whatever thing he had"". Then literally the next mission the same thing popped up. I'm sure to some this feels really interesting, but to me it feels like whether I win or fail doesn't really matter other than the nebulous ""panic levels"".
> This game does not have a good tutorial. I'm generally not a fan of games where the best ""tutorial"" is a friend who's trying to help you out rather than the game itself. Weird unexplained mechanics galore.
> I can't really tell where the ""tactics"" choices are in this game. I was expecting missions that resembled more like puzzles -- there are a bunch of ways to tackle the objective, and you get to choose how you get through the mission. Instead the ""tactics"" seem to just be saving the game repeatedly, reloading when something doesn't go your way, and playing extremely cautious lest an alien spawn right next to your soldiers. I don't like savescumming, and it feels like you get punished hard if you don't.
> The interface and UX is terrible. It's really not that hard to have a movement spot follow your cursor, but this game seems to delight in how far off you often need to aim to hit a certain spot. Some elements that seem clickable aren't, and vice versa.
> When you're bound to fail a mission, you fail hard. And the game forces you to watch it all unfold right in front of you. I was in a ""rescue civilians"" mission, and it started okay, but eventually too many civilians got turned into zombies. I spent a minute watching the zombies and the walker guy just... kill my soldiers. Can't fast forward, can't skip, just watch them die in real time. Sure, really sets the dire mood the game seems to be going for. Also isn't fun.

I'm not going to pretend that I'm a huge fan of turn based strategy games. I tried this game to see if I could expand my horizons. This is not the turn based strategy game you give someone to turn them into a fan of the genre. I'm sure it's a great game for those who are already fans. I wish I could turn off the part of my brain that can't help but think ""just shoot him, he's literally right in front of you! why are you waiting!"", but I can't. This might just not be my type of game, and that's okay. Just means I don't personally recommend it.

This game is set on making my soldiers barely get out of missions alive, somewhat similar to Darkest Dungeon. Whilst some people like that concept, it's too stressful for me.

I ended up starting a new campaign on the easiest difficulty and save-scumming a lot during missions. Ironically that was when I had the most fun playing it, though it sometimes made the missions too easy. Unfortunately it was short-lived and I did not finish the campaign due to a lot of crashes when loading saves, especially saves in the middle of a mission. This was obviously very inconvenient for my practice of save-scumming. Note that this was also a problem even without save-scumming however. 

Other negatives:
The panic system which makes you lose the game if too many countries get a high enough panic level. Too anxiety-inducing for me.
The forced cinematic animations during combat. I wouldn't mind if there was a button I could click to skip these. I have to say they looked very cool sometimes though.
The seekers which turn invisible and can instantly kill soldiers.

I also had at least two other issues that I can remember:
I could not click where I wanted to click on the grid during missions when using ultrawide resolution.
Random crashes during combat not related to saving or loading.


I gave this game multiple chances and started several new campaigns on various difficulties and settings before doing the save-scumming thing but I just couldn't get into it unless I save-scummed. This along with the crashing issues made me conclude that this game isn't for me, and if you get stressed out in games that constantly try to corner you, it probably isn't for you either.",1684500082,1684500082,False,1,2,0.49602121114730835,0,True,False,False

As a fan of the original UFO Enemy Unknown game, I was excited to try this modern reimagining. While the game doesn't quite live up to the original, it's still a worthwhile buy for any strategy game enthusiast.

One of the strengths of Xcom - Enemy Unknown is its engaging gameplay. The turn-based combat system is intuitive and strategic, and the game offers a variety of classes and abilities to customize your soldiers and build your squad. The game also features a base-building mechanic, where you must manage resources and research new technologies to stay ahead of the alien threat.

However, Enemy Unknown does fall short of the original UFO Enemy Unknown game in some aspects. The gameplay is not quite as addictive and memorable, and the atmosphere is not as intense.

That being said, Xcom - Enemy Unknown is still a solid strategy game that offers hours of challenging and enjoyable gameplay.

For me, XCOM is a series about achieving a near-impossible task of overthrowing a full-scale alien invasion, which is why I enjoy the permanence of playing on ironman. But when I get hit by a bug that causes a sectopod to mow down all my experienced troops several dozen hours into a campaign, it's hard for me to enjoy the journey that is the rest. And, while I did not encounter them this time, I know that there are other bugs that can softlock the game entirely or otherwise corrupt saves during critical story missions.

Thankfully, someone told me to buy the game on PC and I freaking loved it.  It almost felt like this game had ironed out all the problems I had with its sequel.
Overall:  I lost to this game several times before I beat it and never once did I feel cheated, I had tons of fun even if I lost, and its one of the few games I have bought over multiple platforms.
Pro:
-One of those types of games that when you make a mistake, its your fault.
-The difficulty is very well set and I never felt overwhelmed or frustrated.
-It does a great job of teaching you the game without an overstayed tutorial section.
-Even if you make  mistake, you can recover with a good strategy.
-Every class feels pertinent
Cons:
-The sniper class is a bit overpowered.
-Don't look for a story rich game experience here.
-Some enemies who a VERY strong enemies are thrown in at ""awkward"" moments (for lack of a better term)  and felt more like a difficulty spike as opposed to a natural progression.

- 2 action points instead of 50-70 like in the original, soldiers normally just walk once and shoot once. This takes away some depth yet makes you camp less 
- can only take 6 soldiers in a mission instead of 14 -> faster turns but fewer tactical options 
- night missions have the same visibility as daytime ones, no flares -> easier, but micromanaging flares was fun and night missions used to be real challenge 
- a strange cover system: when a mob is behind an edge of a wall, it still can be shot at, yet with a high penalty. Most battlefields are filled with tree logs, groups of stones, stairs-like elevation levels which makes the battles mostly about running from cover to cover and staying on Overwatch 
- critical hits are important -> more randomness 
- soldiers have no stats (which grew from ""usage""), instead the game randomly assigns them to specializations (sniper, heavy, assault, support). Specializations offer a few special abilities though 
- after getting max rank (""Colonel""), soldiers won't improve anymore (only psi abilities, if they have psionic powers), which doesn't let you train super-ninzas and forces you to send new soldiers to let them train as well 
- a few new types of missions which are heavily scripted and linear, usually with a turn limit 
- can only build facilities in one base, no storage limit, no ammo -> less micromanagement but feels too casual 
- mobs' facing doesn't play any role: they see equally well all around them, and attacks from behind don't inflict more damage (though usually a mob won't have a covering object behind it and will be considered ""flanked"") 
- no arctic/desert/jungle maps but many varied urban maps
- a soldier can take just 1 extra item (e.g.1 grenade) in addition to main weapon and pistol 

The bad: 
- most battles are scripted and not randomly generated. Enemies appear when you pass trigger tiles and take a free move to get behind cover right after they appeared. Some fall directly from above (out of thin air) behind your troops, switching to Overwatch and pinning all your soldiers down. Some will run very close to you, all while you're waiting for their animation to finish. This takes away much strategic feeling as all your battle plans are trampled by script. Worse, it makes playing on higher difficulty or iron man mode pointless, as it feels unfair to lose when you didn't know in advance a scripted situation
- camera always tries to zoom in on the next selected soldiers which is very annoying if you want to keep camera zoomed out for a tactical overwiev 
- camera sometimes fails to correctly detect the tile under the cursor -> it may take many attempts to open a door with V key (and rotate the camera for that a lot), or sometimes the solder will run to a wrong tile which is on a different floor and visually behind the one you wish to go to 
- if a soldier sees an enemy during movement he doesn't stop and can even lose sight of the enemy by the end of the move (it was the same in the original XCOM but there you could walk tile-by-tile, and in JA2 soldiers stopped when seeing a new enemy) 
- no base defense missions 
- although everything is destructible you can't shoot at objects, except if your weapon misses an alien and hits an object instead, or you throw a grenade or fire a rocket launcher

It is a great game. At first. Until you notice that everything is RNG. The hit chance is part of the problem but at least you know what the odds are. The big problem is everything else: Which map you get, which enemies, how many and group positions. Flanking is always a gamble. If you go a bit to the right or left there could be another group, so you gamble. People seem to not understand, that whatever you do, it's always gambling. Every move is a dice roll. This leads to the difficulty on 'Classic' ranging between 'Normal' and 'Impossible' changing every turn. How am I supposed to learn the game? If I never know whether what I did was good or not? Did I do something bad and got lucky? Did I do the best move ever and it was impossible? People agree that those things can happen and they like it O.o
My first game on 'Classic' (after fooling around on 'Normal' with the terrible tutorial) was a total success, no reloads and I thought I got the hang of it, killing all the endgame aliens, no problem. Let's try again on 'Classic Ironman' and it was a total disaster. What happened? How can this be?

Example:
I got devastated in high cover, only one dude left. I just said ♥♥♥♥ it and ran out in the open field to die. The enemy missed and I killed him. Mission won. This is what the game is teaching me. That that was a great move and the right thing to do. Was it? Cover is bad?

I then started multiple new games and played just the first mission. Sometimes no one dies, sometimes all die and sometimes some die. Same difficulty.

The majority of excessive details and vast areas of free choice were removed, e.g. Time Units, RPG-like inventory slots, ammunition items, free selection of multiple bases, and their layouts. The player, therefore, has a limited pattern of actions and fewer choices, but it somehow became more convenient to play and less fastidious, especially suitable for non-old school fans. Some elements, like alien races, were redesigned or even reimagined.Several new mechanics introduced in this remake are considerably inventive. For instance, the cover stance and soldier classes offer a totally different experience for old X-COM fans. Unlike remastered products, this is a whole new game worth playing.The storyline is slightly altered but mainly enhanced to become more cinematic. Characters with decent names, histories, dialogues, and cutscenes bring the events of the first X-COM to life again in a more lively way. The background music is also greatly appreciable.This remake is much different from the 1994 original version, but it is well-made and still very addictive, thus becoming another pièce de résistance of the franchise itself.

FIrstly, I want to point out that this game is enjoyable on a PC with Linux and Intel (10th Gen) integrated graphics, I wouldn't have a chance to experience it if it wasn't as optimised. This was possible only due to 2K/Feral making Linux ports, so that it can run natively, and not through emulation/Wine/Proton.

What I really like about it is the atmosphere and the ambient. Battles take place over thematically-unique areas each time, each with their own visuals that feel more like real places than playing fields, which accentuates the feeling of going all over the world to fight aliens. I'm amazed by the way the game mechanics work — even though the playing field looks two-dimensional, it is soon revealed that line-of-sight, elevation and projectile trajectories make the player consider the whole aspect of the terrain. I LOVE how the terrain is destructible, and in ways that affect the gameplay (holes in the walls offer new paths of movement, for example), this feels really ahead of its time for this game. Units gain experience over time, and become irreplaceable part of the squad, but the threat of losing a unit due to bad positioning, or merely bad luck, is ever-present, so one tries really hard to find a way to get everyone to survive. Also, ""random encounter"" missions pop-up every so often, with unique objectives, which makes for some unique situations which make the gameplay diverse.

There are some small things that I dislike about the game: the whole base-building part of the game feels tedious at moments, because it always feels resource-constrained, like you're on your last dollars when buying weapons and facilities, and you have to wait until the next ""paycheck"" to make further purchases and upgrades. I'd much prefer a system where there is no base-building aspect, but you rather get facilities by progressing through the story, and get money from every mission you successfully complete. That, and the micromanagement of the gear between soldiers are some of the aspects that need quality-of-life improvements (that are hopefully present in the next games in the series).

I had just completed Xenonauts after many restarts and loved the challenge it offered. Yearning for more, I bought and installed this game.
I played the campaign without any mods for a moment and felt the game to be too simplified, limited and stupid at times.
Uninstalled the game and let the time pass.
After some months I discovered the Long war -mod, installed it and gave the game another try. With the mod it felt like a completely different game. I played for about 60 hours (on the default settings) and realized that I had botched something important in my fight against the alien threat and had to restart the campaign (this time on the shorter version of the long war). Completed the game (with the Long war mod) and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, although many hours were ""wasted"".

Near the end of the game I had a bug that made one of the buys screens move to other menus and before I noticed the bug I had accidentally put myself at -$2000. If I wasn't already basically done with money it would have ruined my game completely. There was also a bug that spawned some enemies in glitched and they crashed the game but luckily it fixed on reload. So the games not super buggy but if it does bug on Iron Man it could waste tons of hours of game time.

The game's story is nothing special but was entertaining, the gameplay is pretty fun and challenging at times. I felt like the game was fair most of the time and all of the losses I had were from mistakes in my decisions during missions or with the upgrades I was choosing. The game does have a lot of the same fun of the original XCOM with you slowly building up to face the higher tech and powerful enemies and trying to save what you can of the world.

XCOM is a game that I should enjoy. I love this genre of game typically. Final Fantasy Tactics (PS1) is one of my favorite games to have ever been developed. I really enjoy the theme and game play of tactical RPGs that both XCOM and FFT are designed around.

What I don't like is the extreme unexplained difficulty spike that occurs at some point during XCOM, and just about every version of it, I've played more than one of them. I do not have the patience, nor time, to waste dozens of hours researching the best way to play the game on wiki sites and trial and error involved with developing the right team. The game is simply not approachable for the average user. The game NEVER explains at ANY point why the difficulty just happens to sky rocket. You complete several missions and it's all fun, your squad is leveling up and gaining ranks, unlocking new abilities, you learn new tech and upgrade their equipment, then, randomly, the next mission you go on, the aliens absolutely wreck you. If your team makes it out alive, they are all gravely wounded. Healing them in fights doesn't matter either, even if they all leave the level with full health after getting injured, they'll be wounded on the after mission report.

The worst part is, you can't recover from mistakes.  If you hit the difficulty spikes and your team gets wiped out, you are screwed.  You likely don't have another full squad of experienced soldiers.  You can't grind up some other soldiers doing random battles either.  The game moves on.  Your next mission will be the same level of difficulty, or harder.  Only this time, you won't have your experienced soldiers anymore.  You have to load an earlier save file, or restart entirely.  THAT'S NOT FUN.

The 'get gud' crowd can ignore this review, because ya'll don't get it anyway. I'm not a stranger to difficult games. I've mastered the Souls games and Elden Ring, among others. Those games are fair, it's your fault when you lose. XCOM isn't fair, it just rapes you when it's ready to do so, without telling you what you did to trigger it.

Passed that, the game mechanics are fun, other than the difficulty; sound design is good; visuals are good, not great, but its a 7 year old game now. I know a lot of people will pick up these old games after hearing from their friends or online reviews that they are worth purchasing during a Steam sale, but I don't believe this one is. It's on sale right now for $6 USD. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it for even that price.

I know there are a lot of rabidly devoted XCOM fans out there. This is your game, enjoy it. I don't care, it's not for me.",1676781737,1676781852,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the idea of this game. Alienes are invading our planet, countries can't establish a good countermeasure, a secret organization is trying to protect the earth but it needs funds from all the countries... If you don't help a country, they will withdraw from the project and will no longer pay for your services. So you need to make some difficult decisions when your soldiers are wounded, but some country gets invaded...

And if you run out of funds, the game is over. 
It all sounds great, but god damn, this is stressful. Like IRL, you can't please everybody and eventually, you will lose some countries, which is great, I love it when you can't have it all. So you gotta chose the countries that you want to protect and spend some shomeny on it - either for your soldiers or some satellites or other passive protection systems. What I didn't like tho, is the not-so-clear protection systems that you can get. Should you just keep buying satellites? Maybe jets to protect them? Upgrade the weapons of the jets? Maybe fuck it and invest in soldiers? Maybe invest in upgrading your base? They are so many options but yet, but it feels like there is just one good strategy, and the rest is not so profitable. But everything is expensive so you gotta know where to invest into. 

So, I was really excited about the base-building aspect of this game. I found it the most interesting, and in a way, I'm not disappointed or even amazed. But I still feel like there are too many options that don't do much, everything is kinda expensive and some base customization would be welcome

Regarding the fighting aspect of this game - it's fun. Customizing your squat is fun, losing a member sux but in a good way, tactics are fun and overall the fighting is fun. BUT, I don't like how slow it is sometimes. If you wanna do it right, you gotta spend turns waiting for your other squad members, then reload everybody, set them up, and so on.... And that could take 3-5 turns, which is kinda a lot

The complexity blended with comic book visuals made for a unique experience that was much tougher and deeper than the cover art on the box would have suggested. It was a delightful experience that the run of sequels and spinoffs through the late 90s and early 2000s failed to live up to. 

Along came the remake, streamlined for console play and sadly lacking in the depth and complexity of the original, I felt somewhat let down playing the more action oriented Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within updates when I finally got around to playing them.

Let down, that is, until I applied the brilliant Long War mod and was returned to the brutal struggle for survival against a mysterious alien invasion where the survival of our species hangs on every sniper bullet and panicked run across an open space while shadowy extraterrestrials with vastly superior weaponry lurk in the fog beyond the known.

Long War is the XCom that fans of the classic game wanted, and it delivers in every way that the remake did not in its attempt to be more accessible. Strategy/tactics simulators of the past didn't attempt to appeal to action gaming enthusiasts, they were the domain of history nerds and chess aficionados. The deep statistical play of the Koei franchises didn't do much for players who just wanted to pew-pew their way to victory, they brought you into a world of real warfare, where a single turn of serendipity can turn a winning campaign into an utter disaster regardless of how well planned and perfectly executed your strategy is.

No plan survives first contact with the enemy, and in Long War you'll learn that in a way that strategy players haven't often been able to experience since first booting up the ocean of spreadsheets old time war simulators were based on. In Long War no plan will see the other side of any engagement, and if you want to tear victory from the jaws of certain defeat you better have a contingency plan for your 10th contingency, because fate is a fickle adversary and the gods sit waiting to laugh as you detail your plans for victory. 

In the first XCom game brought to our bulky CRT screens in the 1990s we felt the fear of the uncertain. We watched as our star soldiers, groomed through hours of gruelling combat got butchered like plump hogs on the abattoir floor when a single moment of hubris unravelled 40 hours of meticulous preparation. Long War brings back that experience, where caution and bravado must dance the delicate ballet of warfare and heroes are born on the ashes of bellowing fools with each knuckle biting moment of unrelenting bloodshed.

Long War is indeed a long war, and one you'll be better for having fought in the event you manage to scrape victory out of the hands of fate with determination, grit and at least a little bit of sheer luck.

If you want to play XCom the way we knew it before 3D graphics and high def flat screens find Long War on Nexus and get comfortable for the beating you're about to endure. Better than the improved graphics and shiny interface Fraxis used to replace deep tactical mechanics, you'll almost smell the blood and cordite on the field of battle while you struggle to survive an invasion by a technologically superior menace that attacks you unprepared while politicians bicker over how much investment a true existential threat deserves.",1627038001,1675962275,True,1,0,0.51530611515045166,0,True,False,False

It is a great game. At first. Until you notice that everything is RNG. The hit chance is part of the problem but at least you know what the odds are. The big problem is everything else: Which map you get, which enemies, how many and group positions. Flanking is always a gamble. If you go a bit to the right or left there could be another group, so you gamble. People seem to not understand, that whatever you do, it's always gambling. Every move is a dice roll. This leads to the difficulty on 'Classic' ranging between 'Normal' and 'Impossible' changing every turn. How am I supposed to learn the game? If I never know whether what I did was good or not? Did I do something bad and got lucky? Did I do the best move ever and it was impossible? People agree that those things can happen and they like it O.o
My first game on 'Classic' (after fooling around on 'Normal' with the terrible tutorial) was a total success, no reloads and I thought I got the hang of it, killing all the endgame aliens, no problem. Let's try again on 'Classic Ironman' and it was a total disaster. What happened? How can this be?

Example:
I got devastated in high cover, only one dude left. I just said fuck it and ran out in the open field to die. The enemy missed and I killed him. Mission won. This is what the game is teaching me. That that was a great move and the right thing to do. Was it? Cover is bad?

I then started multiple new games and played just the first mission. Sometimes no one dies, sometimes all die and sometimes some die. Same difficulty.

The gameplay is great and challenging at times, since I didn't permit myself to savescum. Savescumming would have definitely broken the game for me. The combination of base building/management and the missions was just about right. A couple more different mission types would have definitely been quite an approvement though. The leveling up of the soldiers and being able to upgrade their weaponry kept the gameplay from going stale.

The story is quite bland and predictable. It could have been better with some more depth and perhaps a plot-twist or two.

The graphics and audio (design) haven't really stood the test of time. And I dare to say they weren't that exciting back in 2012 as well. It's not that they're bad, but they're simply really, really plain and boring.

All in all, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a proper reboot and to me it feels like a solid blueprint for the later XCOM games. I will definitely be playing the DLC (Enemy Within) and will most likely check out its sequals (XCOM 2 and Chimera Squad) as well. I'm curious to see how Fireaxis have improved on what they've done here.

I played hundreds of hours in this game's sequel, XCOM2, and I wanted to give it's predecessor a chance, but for technical issues (I'm using a 2560x1080 monitor for this), I couldn't do more than an hour of it. While back in 2012 this game might have been fine, in 2023 the UI just doesn't seem to work with wide-screen monitors. The game gets incredibly zoomed at the XCOM base for certain menus, such as when viewing soldiers for example. In addition, I've noticed my mouse position doesn't actually match up where the game thinks my mouse is (If I hover over a tile, the game will select a tile about 3-4 tiles away instead. Also, it feels as if this game was designed to be used on controllers only (which it probably was, considering this game is also on PS3 and Xbox 360), considering due to the aforementioned mouse issues, I was forced to use the arrows on my keyboard to navigate most of the menus. There might be mods that fix these issues, but as far as the base game without mods is concerned, these issues prevent me from finishing the game.

If you really want to get into XCOM, just get XCOM 2 instead (Or even Chimera Squad if you want to get a smaller, different XCOM experience for a lower price), it's much more polished in comparison and it runs perfectly fine on modern systems (Along with modding support for both games if you want to try out mods). If you're worried about story and things getting spoiled by playing the sequel first, don't be.

XCOM Enemy Unknown doesn’t even attempt to use the former as an insult. Rather, it embraces the latter and applies it to all levels of the game. You can kill the stupid alien overlords who were sent here by God himself but they will still try to blow you up with plasma lasers. You can take out the smart alien leaders but they’ll try to outmaneuver you. And so on and so forth.

377 hours and I STILL haven't beaten it. 

If you're reading this, don't keep hammering away at Classic Difficulty Ironman like I did for years. You will just get frustrated and quit (unless you use walkthrough/spoilers/cheese). Just play on Normal difficulty until you can (finally) beat it. You'll probably lose your first few games on Normal if you go in without walk-throughs.

Just play it blind. It's extremely difficult (blind) even on Normal, but still fair.

The mechanics are initially very simple; move a character on a grid, see a group of enemies, try your best to move to a good covered location and get the advantage on your foes, and roll that 95% and lower hit ratio to miss half the time and then get critted in the face and have your party all perma die. Then go to base, spend all your money on a research that never comes in early enough because you're getting the sh!t kicked out of you and you need these items now, not in a week. 

And... That is the charm.

It's not for ragers, for sure. But if you enjoy a challenge that rewards good choices to a T, and every now and again get a curve ball against you... This is one of the best.

The game has a deep and strategic combat system, with a variety of units and abilities to choose from. The controls are tight and responsive, and the game has a good difficulty curve that keeps things challenging but not frustrating.
One of the standout features of XCOM: Enemy Unknown is its character customization. The game lets you customize your soldiers with a variety of different skills and abilities, allowing you to tailor your team to your playstyle. It's a fun and innovative gameplay mechanic that adds a lot of depth to the game.
The graphics in XCOM: Enemy Unknown are excellent, with detailed character models and environments. The game's music and sound effects are also top-notch, adding to the atmosphere.
One downside to XCOM: Enemy Unknown is that the game can be a bit repetitive. You'll be doing a lot of the same actions over and over again, and the levels can start to feel a bit samey after a while. That being said, the game has a high replay value, and you'll probably find yourself coming back to it again and again.
Overall, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an excellent turn-based tactical RPG that's a lot of fun to play. Its deep combat system and character customization make it a game that's worth checking out. The occasional repetitive gameplay can be a bit of an issue, but it doesn't really impact the overall enjoyment of the game. If you're a fan of turn-based tactical RPGs, you should definitely give XCOM: Enemy Unknown a try.",1672542554,1672542554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fraxis streamlined it too much and the focus on combat balance harmed other aspects. It's a travesty that a game made in 1993 had deeper combat mechanics than a modern one. You had night missions in UFO, where aliens could see more than you so there was a need to use flares or molotovs. Action-Point system allowed for more flexibility when it came to running and shooting. Different modes of firing each weapon(Should I snap a shot at the alien then runaway? Or try to empty the entire clip?) whereas in Enemy Unknown there's only one way to use your weapons. There's also too much limitations on inventory. Soldiers having to choose between having a medkit or grenade is just dumb. One of the tactics in UFO was to use an array of smoke grenades to make way for your offense. In Enemy Unknown only a specific class can throw smoke grenades and he can only do it in limited times. I don't even want to talk about the ""Fate of the world rests in your hand but you can only send 4 ppl at a time""...
Yeah it's more challenging, the older games had this problem of getting too easy in late-game, but EU with trench warfare being the only way to win has sucked the fun out of the game.

Kind of sucks when the original game was probably the best tactical game made at the time. Having eight soldiers and a tank fighting a horde of aliens in an environment that is pretty much completely destructible is something I guess we'll never get a chance to see again in this series.

Hell, I'm an old UFO fan. UFO: Enemy Unknown was one of the few strategy games I could run in my crappy Pentium 1 PC, back in ye olde toyme when we could still count the pixels in the screen with the fingers of the hand. 

At this point I've played... practically all the franchise, and all its weird clones and offshoots and spinoffs and, finally, the reboot. 

Firaxis did... a lot of things with the franchise. Some things I am glad to have happened, and back then when this came out, followed by XCOM 2, I was elated to finally see XCOM back in the land of the living, with all the bells and whistles, with the geoscape management and the tactical combat, with its branching research paths and punishing gameplay.

And I'm still glad that it happened, but looking back at it, I see more flaws than good. 

There was a serious attempt to streamline the old formula, but I feel a lot of the game was lost to simplicity, and what remains is a hero-tactics with horrible RNG, soulless character, forgettable music, unnecessary action scenes, slow-af animations, and generally unsatisfying mechanics.
Everything that I liked about the old UFO games is not here.

You can play at low difficulty for a casual experience or max if out for pretty challenging play.  The AI is pretty good.  Graphics in the game are quite lively for its age and I really can only offer ONE big complaint.  The game camera gets just a little NUTSO now and then.  When your sequence ends (that depends on how many soldiers you have trained and sent on a particular mission) but like i was saying when your sequence ends the game will just randomly pick a place on the screen (or off screen) and that will be your view while the aliens do THEIR 'sequence', issuing orders to each soldier...   the camera sucks sometimes.  ok.  pretty badly.  I like to see what the 4 aliens are doing in response to my having them trapped in a tight spot but the camera will jump over two 'run lengths' away and show me THAT instead...

otherwise i love the game and i've only played this one so far.  there are many dlc's.
the replay value alone of Enemy Unknown makes it one of my favorites.  many games don't offer much replay value.  this one does.

It's always nerve wracking when a classic is reinvented for a modern audience; nostalgia is a powerful drug; as it's more common for people to remember the good parts and completely blank on the bad. However I'd say 2k and Firaxis really hit the mark with this by delivering a great experience.

First the good: This game does well to capture the high points of the original. Moving into an unknown area worried you'll hit aliens is alive and well in this game. Watching rookies grow into your favourite squad mates is another; alot of little shout outs have also been made; with the global map, council reports and so fourth. 

Now the Neutral: A major change, which I still don't know if I like it overall; is that Action points are basically a ""two actions per turn"" sort of deal; more like a tabletop RPG style game rather than a random number of action points. This strangely steals a bit of the character from...well the characters really; as it removes a bit of headless chicken run around more in favour of a ""tactical"" approach.

Now the bad: Sacrifices have been made to streamline the gameplay significantly. Where as in older games it could take a good hour or so to do a mission (or literal seconds if a damn Sectoid threw a grenade into the skyranger); most the missions in this game are no more than 20 minutes or so only really lengthening towards the end into the 1-1.5 hour mark. Next there's now tighter loadouts with the class system - you can't just throw gear on people and stuff their pockets with items and slowly learn what they are good at; instead you get pre-defined skill trees and gear preferences. Finally the base building - it's nice they kept a base building mechanic; but in all honesty I felt it was really lacking any kind of value other than a tech-tree gating mechanism.

Is it worth playing though? Yes.

The story knows what it's doing, as it plays heavily into every sci-fi alien trope you can think of: from grey aliens and flying saucers, to the monumental breakthroughs discovered from reverse engineering the alien technology.

The enemy variety is on par with the best of the halo franchise and will leave you war stories about how your team barely escaped through the skin of their teeth.
A personal example of mine comes from my first civilian rescue mission: All my officers were recovering from wounds of the previous battle save for one, leaving him with a team of under-trained rookies. When touched down, the entire squad was baited into an ambush by floaters and chrysallids, picking the rookies off one-by-one until the last rookie hunkered down with the officer, and secured a strong enough defense to mow down the straggling zombies. I gave that surviving rookie the honor of turning him into a mech trooper.

Though, the saving system is absolutely defunct! SO A BIG NO.

More below. 

Game Saving System: 

- Save files' order is completely broken if you keep more than 50-100 save files.
- If there is more than that, game must be relaunched to access recent saves.
- Occasionally, save files are randomly deleted. 
- Sometimes, game is not saved, no matter how many times you press Save.
- Sometimes, one save file is loaded instead of any other. Game must be relaunched. 

These problems started showing in just 2 days after I started playing.
A game with so many substantial problems with its saving system wasn't worth any of the money!
..................................................

Now, to game mechanics. 

 There are a few game mechanics points that do not make sense at all, e.g., aliens are able to cut through covers like butter, their aim landing is much better than the player's forces since the beginning of the game, and they can land shots from almost every angle, and only one shot from them can almost all the time kill a soldier, while the player faces disadvantages in all of the areas all the while. In late game, a number of enemy units will ALWAYS, without exception, hit your soldiers if they are not in full cover- and this is when they are in range from the enemy and not flanked!

The difficulty levels might have to do something with this, but changing the most basic mechanics in favor of the enemy to THIS extent doesn't bend the game, it breaks the game. 
.........................................................

Game Design 

What's even more, recruiting better body armor for the soldiers takes so long, recruiting even stronger weapons that can kill the aliens in two turns and not in 6 turns or in forever takes too long, and being able to equip strong anti-UFO weapons on your birds takes forever, while the aliens bring saucers to your sky that no amount of birds can shot down before you can even finish researching the rudimentary weapons.

Game design rationale says that you should make it possible for the player to be able to achieve a rational level of countering power. On higher difficulty levels, they should be more careful in managing research and other elements so that they can achieve that faster. Making it so they face literally unbeatable enemies sooner is not a smart design, it is a lazy one.  It will make it so that they can beat those monstrous enemies at very high costs, which will lead to them lagging behind from further progress in the mid-term, and getting weaker still until they are obliterated. 

This is not a good ""strategy"" nor a management game design.

The combat sections are what make this game what it is. The mechanics are interesting, and combat is easy to grasp but still has a real need for tactics. The permanent death system for soldiers is interesting and made me consider any action before I decided on it, though I told myself that I wouldn't save scum for the best possible outcome while playing on easy. Though I haven't played any other games in this genre, this is probably the standard that I'll hold all others to.
The geoscape/base/campaign mechanics make sense. They do a very good job tying the effects of combat into greater scale conflict. The research and development parts are cool and trying to get your money to last a whole month before the next pay day requires some pretty strategic planning. 
I didn't understand how half that shit worked for a long ass time. I was getting outpaced by the aliens because I rarely had enough funding to keep research in pace with enemy developments because I didn't realize that I relied on satellites to gain money. By the time I finally did realize, it was too late and I needed to build a shit ton of additional infrastructure and tech to even put satellites in the air. It took me like 120 in-game days to get back on track.
Of course, if you aren't brain-dead and can remember what the tutorial tells you, you'll be fine. I'm sure if I played through it again, I'd beat it in far fewer days and with less pain.

I could tear apart stuff like the complete absence of inventory and looting system during missions but this game isn't even worth the effort.

if you want an actual xcom game, stick with the UFO series and there are other games which I haven't tried yet but look like they do it wayyyyyyyy better, I think one of those is xenonauts

If your whole squad dies and you lose a mission...the game continues on. There is no redo (you can save scum, but that's not recommended). That squad of experienced XCOM soldiers is DEAD, and you will likely sorely miss them in your next battle as rookies break under the stress and get themselves killed. You will also lose approval with the UN and likely lose funding as well, making your path a little harder. 

And this all sounds very punishing, but that punishment is exactly what makes winning feel so amazing. Perfectly ambushing an alien party feels amazing. Winning a battle with no casualties (or even with no injuries sometimes) feels amazing. Putting together an elite alpha squad of soldiers whose names and accomplishments you remember feels amazing. I can still remember a lot of my best soldier's names and best moments in battle.

-absolutely garbage camera controls
-command a custom squad on missions in turn-based combat
-rogue-like permadeath for your soldiers
-earn funding from countries through choice of actions/missions
-manage your budget
-fund research of new tech
-build a satellite detection network and equip interceptors to shoot down UFOs
-very fun 10% of the time to build/manage your UFO defense agency
-shitty tactical game-play 90% of the time with LITERALLY fake ""% chance to hit"" indicators (extensive testing revealed there is no actual RNG whatsoever; some other random mystery game mechanic determines whether you hit or not*) AND very poor indicators for cover and line of sight leave you absolutely mystified as to WTF is going on - funny since this game is based mostly on its turn-based combat but a simple isometric rpg like the Shadowrun rpg series gets it right and is actually fun...
-can't ALT-F4 to ragequit, and this game needs it, BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN EASILY DELETE THE GAME...

*test this yourself if you want: enter a mission, save the game, take a shot, re-load the save, take the shot again = same result EVERY SINGLE TIME, OVER AND OVER... SO WHY HAVE AN INDICATOR FOR ""% CHANCE TO HIT"" AT ALL?! WTF GAME DESIGN?!

BRUH... WORST TURN-BASED COMBAT I'VE EVER SEEN ASIDE, HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO HAVE GARBAGE CAMERA CONTROLS IN AN ISOMETRIC TURN-BASED GAME?!?!

Playing the game is a chore, losing squad members to very crappy game-play mechanics where you basically rely much more on the luck of predicting where aliens will pop than any actual tactics, since the aliens literally materialize from thin-air. MOST GOOD TACTICAL TURN-BASED GAMES THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF BEING TACTICAL IS TO SEE WHERE THE ENEMY IS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT TO DO ON YOUR TURN, but not only can you not figure out if you're covered properly from enemy fire, but you have no idea where the enemies are gonna be suddenly appearing in full overwatch mode so that they hit you as soon as you move = enemy pops behind you where you aren't covered, ok, then they get a free clear shot at you (and it's VERY easy to die, you can only take a couple shots max before your soldier is permanently dead). Also, their idea of ""Normal"" difficulty is a total joke, and you'll have to make sure to save your game every few turns and be willing to repeat the same long turn-based encounters over and over to succeed without losing any squad members. It's just not fun, and seriously, when you have 4 levels of difficulty, a seasoned gamer should not have trouble completing missions on level 2. This is just braindead game design. Ultimately, the game is not friendly to anyone who isn't an expert in how to quickly acquire all the satellites and gear they need to survive AND IT IS JUST NOT FUN.

That said, the presentation is pretty cool, and the overall feeling of running the UFO defense group is interesting. I tried to enjoy the turn-based combat equally, but it's pretty bad honestly. It's barely enjoyable enough to continue with the overall game. I understand that the game is supposed to have you losing squad members so that you are forced to replace them by recruiting more, but it doesn't seem like every mission should cost you squad members on ""normal"" difficulty. When the game progresses this way, and you're relatively new to it, you find yourself broke, and basically losing the game, with your resources being drained faster than you can rebuild your X-Com agency, but this isn't something you realize right away, and you only find out many phases later that you didn't take the right actions or develop the right tech to have any hope of succeeding. = NOT FUN.

6/10

I BARELY recommend this game, and only because I thought it was fun at first until I realized that on top of the piss-poor cover indication system the RNG turn-based combat was rigged and the ""%"" chance to hit was utterly meaningless, and I have no idea how they determined which of your shots hit or not, but it was NOT the ""%"" chance indicated on the screen, that's for damned sure, as I mentioned discovering after rigorous testing... guys... like... your game kinda sucks. 

Could easily have been a 9-10/10 with MUCH better tactical turn-based combat with better indicators of wtf is going on cover-wise, and ACTUAL FUNCTIONAL RNG WHEN IT SAYS RNG RIGHT ON THE FKING SCREEN, and FAR better game balance. the game is just insanely infuriating for a new player.",1653419022,1665257405,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

Ten years after release, this game is still one of the most addicting yet punishing games I've ever played.  It's a turn based strategy game that still feels unique despite its imitators - adding the depth of base building, management and unit customization like no one else. The game has its problems but the steady drip of rewards through good plays on the field and at the home base can really make for quite a few late night ""eyes locked to the screen too long"" adventures. When I finally did beat the game after having it mock me in my library for far too long, it felt better than the last ten games I completed. 

That all being said, Enemy Unknown isn't prefect - at times feeling like a execution that only got through 80% of a sectoid's neck. You know that good old 99% shot missing meme? That doesn't really happen but what does is inconsistent percentages for seemingly similar situations throughout the missions. You on the other side of the door from an enemy? Like literally could smell their breath close? Sometimes its a reasonable 90% of above chance hit, other times it's only 40% - and this will be on an enemy as thick as a truck and doesn't dodge much at all. 
This is one of the many instances where it feels like the gameplay doesn't match up with the presentation - the other main one being the proto-concealment system that the sequel would utilize : it feels finicky and inconsistent, making it unclear at points what one movement of your soldier will reveal. This gets really annoying in interiors, even up to the final level which is covered in darkness, even for the most basic doors. You could go ahead blindly but that takes away from the strategic value when you're just bumbling into encounters that never stop being deadly. Another argument for save scumming.

One last gripe on the gameplay is the RNG. It is central to the game but it can lead to the difficulty and encounter rate getting kind of funky in the beginning and end of the game. The amount of attacks at the end of my recent playthrough got so low, the crew could have assumed the aliens started retreating behind our backs. RNGesus also makes some enemies appear really early, so invest in those plasma and energy weapons ASAP because you do not want ballistic based snipers in these situations. 

A minor gripe would be the story, as unimportant as it is in something like this. The dialogue could have been as artificially generated as the random soldiers for how much it matters - coming off as bland, redundant and characterless. 

Overall though, this list of gripes didn't stop me from mainlining the game for over two weeks. The DLC additions are ok - one being essentially an early difficulty spike but having worthwhile rewards (Slingshot) and the other main one being an alternative way of playing the same campaign (Enemy Within). Augmented soldiers and mechs are cool but it doesn't change enough in my opinion to warrant a playthrough right after finishing the main game. 
So buy the game when you can, build those satellites early and mourn as your soldiers perish against caustic middle managers in suits and the cost of the memorial grows ever larger...or just reload a save until you get everyone out alive every time.

*The Good stuff*
- Challenging even in normal difficulty.
- It makes you constantly think of a plan for your next move.

*The not so good stuff*
- Frustrating af, especially if you try to keep everyone alive. 
- A bit before mid-game, if you have been grinding materials, you'll notice everything gets so difficult out of the sudden with heavy armored aliens that can wipe your soldier in 1 shot, so you better invest in some good armor ASAP. Also upgrade your aircraft ASAP as well! The game will punish you if you don't.

I tried all known workarounds against the random crashes, black screens, dramatic drop on FPS, and nothing worked, even lowering all settings to the lowest possible (despite having a specs that far surpass such which is required by the game). A real pitty because the game seemed really great. Asked for a refund and was dennied it on the grounds I had ""played beyond 2 hours"" without taking into consideration I was actually testing the game stability, the workarounds and that game crashes totally at random (meaning I had to replay the tutorial mission 4 times). So much for quality service...

UPDATE 1: I managed, after tinkering a lot, to make the base game playable by setting the NVIDIA Control Pannel V-Sync to ""Adaptive"" and can run the game even at full settings (sans the own game's Framerate Smoothing and V-Sync). Unfortunatelly, this all is for naught as soon as the ""Enemy Within"" expansion is installed, as the game will randomly crash, no matter how low the settings. A real pitty because, like I said, the game is really cinematic on it's approach to missions and everything.

UPDATE 2: I found out that disconnecting all non-critical USB devices (mainly a gamepad controller in my case), helped a lot with the stability and completely solved the FPS drop that, otherwise, happens around 1 or 2 hours of continuous game with the expansion installed.

I was looking for an alternative to D:OS 2, and although the combat system has its similarities... THE STORY. My God, my honest experience was that I enjoyed the tactical and careful gameplay for each mission (soldiers are permadeath), the story just sweeps you up from under your feet and you find yourself attaching to your favorite soldier/s and think of yourself as an actual Commander. You will want them to succeed, you will want to put an end to the alien invasion to protect everyone, and by God you will do everything within your mental power to do so. Your soldiers are very, VERY loyal to you and will do whatever stupid, regretful, or brilliant decisions you make. It just entertained the hell out of me how I feel like a real commander after finishing the game. It was hell of an emotional rollercoaster, but I'm looking forward to the next installment of the series in my library. Enjoy the game and buy it whether on sale or full price. It's actually worth it.

TL;DR: Combat is fun, challenging, and tactical. Soldiers have permadeath. You will feel so much pain for losing a Colonel. Story takes a little bit of puzzling together at first, but as you play along does it sweep you up your feet and you will want to eliminate this alien invasion once and for all. If you like tactical, turn-based gameplay with a good, GOOD story, get this. On sale or not.

PS: Definitely play XCOM: Enemy Within if you have it when you first play the game. It has all the contents of Enemy Unknown multiplied by 3.

I can recommend this game to avid SLG players, with some caveats. Firstly, the negatives.

Compared with DOS-era XCOM titles, this one is way more restrictive. In the older titles, not only did you have a lot more macro level play options, there was also some sort of RPG experience mixed in. As you grind your rookies to level up many varied attributes and give them better equipment, they go from die-of-heart-attack-at-seeing-the-first-alien, to superheros who bring death to enemies casually with confidence. In this installment, the enemy's HP/abilities are more or less scaled to your own levels/game progress. You barely have any chance to feel elated with your superiority before the game ends. And indeed if you do, the next instant you will regret it, when your ass is handed to you with multiple of your best guys dying left and right. Cautious, cautious, and always be cautious in this game.

This game can be viewed as a very carefully crafted cinematic experience. You have very little actual freedom to play creatively or at your own terms. There's always some sort of imminent danger here and there, and you are always on your toes.

So, the pro of the game is also exactly that. Cinematic, tense, a gripping experience from start to finish. Except some similarity at the tactical layer, this game cannot be too different from its predecessors.

No auto save during mission turns can cause some rather frustrating replays when your 95%, 82%, and 75% chances to hit all miss. The panic system just seems designed to punish you. If not for the randomness of where abductions and terror missions pop up, one could strategize around this, but the RNG is all that ends up mattering. 

Also, having to individually make every weapon and piece of armor and then individually swap them around on soldiers each mission is a huge pain that simply doesn't exist in XCOM 2, as it allows you to make ""squad upgrades"" rather than going through the painstaking process of individual gear swaps constantly. Going back to this system is awful.

It is also far too easy to get a flanking angle in XCOM 1. Also, you're not able to jump over or drop down nearly as fluidly as in XCOM 2. 

On the flip side, XCOM 1 and Enemy Within does a better job of having fighter craft down UFO's, and with Enemy Within, you can train up and launch covert ops, which makes the ""Gunslinger"" path of the sniper a legitimate choice, unlike in XCOM 2.

Sam Song was just a regular recruit at XCOM HQ. His first mission was to go help with data retrieval on an EXALT cell. ""It's going to be an easy mission"", Central thought, they had dealt with an EXALT mission before, and the squad that was going was mostly veteran soldiers, along with a rookie to train.

As they arrived on the scene, it was very quiet for a few turns. No enemies in sight. But as soon as the squad made it to the roof of a building where the encoder for the mission was, it started to go to shit.

First, our Sergeant Sniper got dropped by an unfortunate crit. XCOM always prepares in case of a soldier death, no biggie. Every turn thereafter, more and more EXALT members rushed in, and Sam Song's squads firepower was not enough to staunch the flow of incoming enemies.

One after one, Sam's allies dropped dead trying to protect the encoder and later the transmitter to ensure that the mission would not fail. In the end it was up to Sam and the covert operative for the mission. The covert op was some form of miraclemaker, as they would not get hit by conventional fire. She dodged at least 9 shots from the enemy (including flanks) before succumbing to a grenade and a shot right next to her

Sam Song kept dropping the enemy troops like flies for those last moments. With the help of his 5 squad member's and the covert op's sacrifice the last enemy had to reload at the critical moment when they would have had a flanking shot on Sam.

Sam finished the mission alone, ranking to a sniper but it was not enough. The loss of almost all of XCOM's vets caused his death on his next mission.

A true soldier to the end. Never forget Sam Song.",1452114763,1660258450,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The remake of one of the golden oldies of the strategy genre. Naturally this made it quite difficult to satisfy the fans of the original as well as to attract new players in equal parts.

What Firaxis did well, was the graphical style and presentation, XCOM offers the style of the first UFO games, while bringing it in the new era. Nothing extraordinaire for sure, but fitting graphics with the one or other really nice possibility to take a screenshot or enjoy the headshot with which your sniper eliminates this pesky alien.

Regarding the gameplay they tried to keep the balance between streamlining and complexity.

The maps are handmade, offering some nice details and mostly destroyable enviroment, but since the random element is gone, they keep on repeating themselves after some playtime.

The same can be said for the progression of the game itself.. your soldiers are basically divided into classes, which have fixed perk trees to choose from on level up. Without the added options of ""Second wave"" and the additional possibilities from ""Enemy within"" to enhance your soldiers with mech or gene modifications, this brings up a similiar problem to the maps, the soldiers are very similiar to each other. As mentioned the add-on options change this in a positive way, beside the modifications you can for example enable that each soldier has different starting stats.
Still this does not reach the complexity of the original X-Com soldiers, but helps the diversity significally.

As for the base management and battles themselves.. once again it is the mix of old and new. The Action points of the old soldiers are gone, now each soldier has two actions per turn (with the right perks, it can be way more though) one for moving, the other for shooting. Again perks as well as equipment can change the possibilities of a soldiers actions.
This system together with an intelligent cover system works quite well and makes for interesting battles.
The base has fixed fields, which you have to fill during the game. Also with the add-on the possibility of the enemy invading your base returns, though as a scripted event.


What gripes i have with the game is, that for example it forces you to go a certain way in science and engineering, besides the story elements themselves. If you don´t rush satellites for most of the states you have a hard time to survive. Same with the interceptors. A bit more freedom and variety would be helpful, especially for a game with such a possible long time motivation. ""Enemy within"" helps in this respect, but cannot eliminate the weaknesses in full.

Nevertheless they did quite a good job, bringing the alien hunt to the modern age.

I always find that mean to say to people that like this game. If you like this game, nothing against you, but I have no clue why. I'll put my bias on the table, but still try to provide information here.

[h1]Serious UX Issues[/h1]
This game plays like an underfunded janky indie game. It's death by a thousand cuts. Every single animation takes forever, for no conceivable reason. Everything moves so slowly, the responsiveness of your cursor is low. It's genuinely a step down in control since 1994, which is impressive. Zero effort has been put into respecting the player's time or having the user experience polished in any way. You have to mod this shit and play it at 2.5x if you don't want to get bored or go insane, depending on how poorly you handle seeing the same 3 second animation for the 5000th time.

Sometimes you can't take two steps in mission without the game completely locking you in place so it can deliver a bland voiceline from a bland character that nobody could possibly like. 

If you can handle a game playing way slower than it could, then this might be OK, but for me it's torture.

[h1]Look & Feel[/h1]
The visual aspect of the game is bland and forgettable, from the design of the aliens, the look of your weapons to the sub-mediocre voice acting. The art direction is borderline lifeless. It's not incompetent, and there were many ways to mess it up worse. But I struggle to find good things to say about it.

One upside the game has is that it allows substantial visual customization of your troops, which is always a neat feature to have.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The plot outright makes the game worse compared to if it were totally absent. It would take too long to explain why and spoil it, but I felt like it added nothing to the game. Not really worth talking about. It's a forgivable sin if not for story missions blasting you with bland voicelines.

[h1]Gameplay Mechanics[/h1]
The amount of strategic and tactical depth this game has is low in vanilla. And it's not great in Long War mod either. I think XCOM: EU and EW are a fundamental step back from XCOM (1994). Instead of taking what was a good about XCOM and vastly improving the user experience and making the game more digestible for wider audiences, they created an almost minimalist turn based game with some weird game design choices.

The amount of options you have during a fight go up towards the end of the game, but they're never great.

However I can say that the core gameplay can be reasonably enjoyable when certain aspects align. Especially if you are a patient player and haven't had your expectations set by other entries in the genre, you might have fun with this.

[h2]Pod System Is Questionable Design[/h2]
XCOM: EU/EW is probably the first game I've played that actively punishes you for moving on the map to this degree. This is due to the pod system. In XCOM 1994, all aliens were active on the map at the same time. In XCOM: EU/EW enemies are distributed into groups (pods) of patrolling and stationary aliens that do not participate in a fight unless they make visual contact with your troops.

The game is balanced around you greatly limiting the number of pods active at the same time. In essence this means that you are always trying to exploit sight increasing items to avoid triggering pods in bad situations, but that's not always possible. You'll be in many situations where there's an awesome tactical opportunity to flank and you just know you can't use it because there's a 50% chance a pod will accidentally see you and make the fight from 4v3 to 4v6 which can and will absolutely kill you on harder difficulties. This encourages a slow and boring playstyle, it feels like playing with handcuffs.

The safe style of playing, which is also the correct style, is made so much worse by the aforementioned slowness in unit animations and the poor responsiveness of the game.

[h2]RNG[/h2]
The RNG of the game no longer makes me angry, but there are some serious problems here. You will see a lot of people complain about this but not manage to explain what the issue is.

In XCOM (1994) you could load 14 soldiers into the Skyranger on your first mission. In this XCOM you start with 4. While this has the benefit of making turns require less action from the user, the downside is that player agency in the face of bad luck is greatly reduced until you get your hands on certain tools.

Until you understand what those tools are, the game will seem arbitrary. This is a huge design flaw in the game, but it is surmountable by installing Long War mod and taking time to understand how to play in a way that mitigates RNG.

[h2]Geoscape aka Strategy Layer[/h2]
In this game you're supposed to go between the Geoscape -- this planetary strategic level where you control bases, interceptors, research and manufacturing -- and the Battlescape, the turn based tactical part of the game.

While the Geoscape has a few nice choices it lets you make in terms of what you're researching first, it has this persistent unpleasant feeling of being very... safe. Very controlled, like you're in a padded room.

XCOM (1994) allowed you much more freedom. Do you want 4 workshops to crank out laser weapons as fast as possible which you sell on the black market for a huge additional income stream? Go for it! Do you want to build 3 additional bases just to work as sensor outposts? No problem.

XCOM: EU/EW has none of this. There are no ""crazy"" things you can do. Overall, I think it has limited player expression, but it's not all bad. I just really wanted more.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
This game feels like a prototype for a better game that never existed. I resent it for failing to be bold or truly competent on any axis because the fundamental idea represented by XCOM has great potential.

I think it's highly rated because the amount of easily accessible games in the turn based tactics genre is pitiful. But, you deserve better than this. If you're not patient by nature or don't have a deep seated ability to appreciate this genre, you'll likely be wasting your time with this game.

If you want a similar but slightly improved experience try XCOM 2.
If you are okay with older games get OpenXCOM and experience the joy of the original XCOM game adapted to modern systems.
If you want an absolutely crazy and rich experience get the XPiratez mod for the original XCOM.
If you want a much (apparently) simpler turn based tactics game with more combat depth and very good UX, try Into The Breach.",1658698169,1658740316,False,4,0,0.48333740234375,1,True,False,False

Perma-death for the units you recruit, customise and send out to save the world from this alien threat is such a good mechanic....even if I had to deal with the loss of many a great soldier (wiping away a tear for my boys Vinnie diesel and Nikki Cage...RIP you legends!) Watching the enemy outflank a unit you rushed forward without doing the smart thing of gathering intel is a rough ride, but you quickly learn from those mistakes and mobilise your units effectively. As with all turn-based titles, and one of the reasons I fell out of love with some, you have to deal with some promoted attacks missing wildly despite being in a good position and having a clear shot. Thankfully I didn't find many of these moments in this game and felt that most of the time it was my bad positioning that led to missed shots and damaged units. This is how it should be, not missing easy targets to drum up fake tension. The level designs make combat interesting and later levels really push your units to their maximum abilities as stronger and stronger enemy units flank, change levels and swarm your squad. The upgrades to your units also extends to your base, allowing you to gather better intel and learn more about the aliens you are fighting. 

This game offers you plenty and kept me entertained for many hours during a time when it should have been the last game I wanted to play, so if that isn't a great endorsement of this game I don't know what is! If you love turn-based tactical strategy games where you can blow apart invading aliens then you are at the right place to get your fix.

As I said, this game is different from UFO: EU(X-com: UFO Defence in america) it is however not worse or dumbed down. They may have simplified the tactical combat, but simplifying is not the same as dumbing down. Dumbing down is making the game easier and losing strategic depth in the process, simpifying is making a game easier to understand while trying to maintain or improve strategical depth.

And XCOM: EU does the latter. The strategic base management is probably even more complicated than it was in the original and the tactical combat is, while streamlined and symplified, just as deep or even deeper than the original game.
It now involves units working together instead of having 14 nearly identical soldiers just scouting if every direction. Ammo is now more important unlike what many 1993 fanboys are saying. Guns still need reloading you just don't need to equip your soldiers with ammo anymore. And most of all there's the completely new cover system. Now, when you move your soldiers, you actually need to think about flanking aliens, because shooting aliens in full cover isn't going to kill them. I've come across a situation where my assault soldier tried to flank an alien but revealed another alien in the process which left him exposed. I then moved my support soldier in to throw a smoke grenade to protect my assault and used my heavy to suppress the flanking alien to avoid him shooting at my assault... Tactical situations like that would almost never occur in the original X-com so i completely disagree wit people who say this game is dumbed down.

The things that were simplified are mainly things like Time Units and i think the new system is actually better. It might kill the nostalgia a bit but this system is faster, easier and makes every decision more important and rewarding.

So, to come to a conclusion: I think this game is absolutely brilliant!",1349802794,1658635157,True,1,1,0.421962171792984009,0,True,False,False

This is my first ever Xcom game. I never played any other game relating to Xcom so it was interesting.
I basically entered the game not knowing what to do but after realizing that it played similarly to Fire emblem I was in my wheelhouse. What’s difficult is not knowing how the story progressed and that everything is random 

It took me Over 30 hours to realize that I was building my base wrong and so I looked up online 
Also I would like to tell new players if you are going to go in to this game brand spanking new look up how the Headquarters is supposed to be built for an optimum build so that everything runs smoothly and fast. 

After getting to the ending and seeing what I have to do I pretty much waited till I upgraded everything in my base that being the equipment and some of my soldiers that has been alive the longest 

Oh also to add after the 30 hours of how to build my base properly I was able to build the high end weapons and armor and I did see a significant improvement after I got all those items my soldiers lived longer battles was faster 

what bothers me is how you cant train your soldiers to be certain classes but luckily it was fixed in xcom 2  oh also to add during my play through I lost France and I think the UK so that was great -.- I didn’t realized that if you lose support from a country you cant get them back so I had to trudged forth with the remaining country’s which was not to hard 

rating 
8.5/10 alien scum bodies.... I lost the other half when I blew up its corpse.... hopefully the black market will take it full price hehe

There's diverse gameplay, what with the fighting and the managing, there's a killer story with tough decisions where someone's going to be having a bad time, and you're the guy who has to answer to all of it. When your Medic you've had since your first mission dies to a thin man, you'll cry. You loved that medic in his bumblebee colored armor. And now he's dead.

Honestly, a lot of what I can say here applies to both XCOM EU/EW and XCOM 2. They're hard, make you think, and are all about minimizing the effects of luck on your carefully laid plans that fall apart after you miss that 85% shot. Many other reviews have done a much better job of explaining this game, so I will instead help you, dear reader, choose between this and it's sequel.
[hr][/hr]
XCOM EU (as I will refer to it and it's expansion, Enemy Within, from now on) is a slower game, where timed scenarios might crop up once or twice in your entire campaign, and serve as a break from the slow and methodical missions that make up the bulk of the game. The ""doom counter"" (essentially, the way the game shows you how close you are to losing) is simply how many Council nations have left/surrendered to the aliens. With careful play, you can [i]heavily[/i] slow the progress of this counter. By the time I finished my first playthrough, I'd only lost a couple countries, and the counter was barely past the halfway mark. However, it [b]cannot[/b] be reduced. This led to me constantly panicking about it, and never once letting it progress when I didn't have to. Your mileage may vary, but overall, it's more of constant slow pressure forcing you to keep an eye on it.
[hr][/hr]
XCOM 2, on the other hand, just feels like a more modern sequel that tried to completely do away with the slow nature of the first game, opting for fast, aggressive combat, but ended up being [i]too[/i] fast. Other than story missions, essentially [u]every[/u] mission in XCOM 2 is timed, forcing you to make aggressive plays and take huge risks, even if you'd rather not. In this game, the doom counter is the mysterious Avatar Project, introduced early on in the game. If this completes, you lose (except that there's a small grace period to act and push it back down before your campaign is over). However, it can be reversed partially to slow it down, but never halted. This game's timer is a constant mountain of pressure - whenever you're not researching weapons technology, you [i]have[/i] to be progressing the story to slow their progress. I'm... not a fan.
XCOM 2 has one thing going for it, though. Modernization. Better soldier customization (beyond armor color, hair, helmet, and name), better graphics, better mod support that is integrated into the Steam Workshop and doesn't require crazy backwards methods to install, etc. etc. Still, I will never forgive them for replacing the badass MEC Troopers with shitty SPARK units. Or making CO Bradford sound like a cranky old man (I kid on this point).
[hr][/hr]
Overall, I would highly recommend this game, and just say try XCOM 2 on a sale/free weekend if you like this one. RNGesus will [i]not[/i] screw you over as much as the memes would make you think, and the story's even pretty good, too.

Impossible difficulty I couldn't break through in about 20hrs, so I just finished this on Classic (hard mode) Ironman.

In fact, XCOM Enemy Within has aspects that are unique and arguably better than XCOM2, and that's coming from a big XCOM2 fan. Both are amazing games, and XCOM2 certainly has some improvements. But overall, the games are very similar, superb turn-based tactical combat with a strategical/upgrade layer. If I had to choose I would choose XCOM2, but they're very similar. Besides the cheapness of getting destroyed on Impossible difficulty, I would say that the biggest problem was the game length. The frequency of missions was a bit much and I would try to rush the missions just to try to progress the story in some way, then another mission would kick in.

The game itself is brilliantly designed... except for some of the sheer BS rage-inducing combat mechanics that you need to be aware of. For example, you can have one of your guys sneak up to the roof of a building, crouch behind obstacles, and hunker down defensively... yet somehow an enemy can shoot him from the other side of the map, from an angle that should be impossible, (through the wall/floor), with a pistol. Meanwhile another alien appears between a group of SIX of your well trained marksmen who were all sat waiting, waiting for this creature to show his face so they can blow it to kingdom come, only to see the words, 'Missed. Missed. Missed. Missed. Missed. Missed,' on your screen, before the alien insta-kills your best soldier. Sigh.

Okay, **** happens. I get that. But in this game it happens *ALL THE TIME*, often without logic or in complete defiance of physics. It seems like both aiming angles and range were simply overlooked in calculating hit percentages, or considered to be very small variables, (suggesting Jack Reacher is always more likely to hit me with a water pistol from 200m away while I'm ducking behind a barricade on a rooftop than I could hit him with flak cannon at point blank range). If you're okay with this frustrating element of the game, then the game itself is a fantastic blend of base-building, squad management, tactics and storytelling. It's a one of a kind masterpiece that could do with a serious gameplay overhaul. (Unfortunately X-Com 2 took things in the opposite direction, imo)",1589171459,1655197662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The physics in this game is not the best, and sometimes people or aliens would float while they moved, or their corpse would float around on the battlefield. Those visual bugs and glitches are fine. They were not too distracting, and they did not do anything else than look funny, but I did encounter one bug that was game changing in my latest playthrough. One of the special missions that you can get from the Council seemed fine at first, but whenever I finished that mission and was in the loading screen after the mission it would crash to desktop. I tried many different things to get through that hurdle, but I could not figure it out and had to skip out on that mission, which means that I both missed the reward for completing the mission and had to take the negative that came with declining a Council mission and that could have ended that playthrough if I had been doing a bit worse.

The game does drag a little bit towards the late middle/ending of the game, once you have all of the tech/armor/weapons unlocked. At that point, you've probably already figured out how to deal with every type of enemy that could appear, so that did affect the sense of tension.

Combat consists of cover that doesn't feel like it changes much, and glitchy-twitchy shooting and cutscenes that feels like it could be replaced by rolling hand-fulls of dice. There's another level of the game, your home base, that packs on the seriousness in the form of resource management  that can punish you hardcore for mistakes. The dissonance between the high randomness and high punishment for failure combines with the occasional forced-mission on an increased difficulty curve to create a potentially enjoyable cocktail for the right player.

XCOM Enemy Unknown and it’s DLC Enemy Within is an incredibly immersive and brilliant game.  It’s one of those games where you can’t set it down.  Organic gameflow, tactical ground missions, and base building all blend seemlessly together.  The game presents a unique challenge as you learn to battle an unknown foe.  Very little handholding is provided as the game gives you a fair challenge, but a challenge nonetheless.  If you can bring yourself to it, I heartily recommend you turn on the ironman setting.  It prevents you from loading previous saves and forces you to overcome your mistakes and/or bad luck.  Randomness is a core mechanic of the game and can feel unforgiving at times but this also adds lots of replay value.

Unfortunately, this game is hopelessly broken. More than once I have had the game totally freeze on me with no recourse except to start over entire missions in order to keep progressing.

I am just warning you if you buy this game make sure to save before each mission so you can start with a good save, but i wold not reward a company that leaves such a glaring hole in such a great game.

It completely changes the game and turns into the best that this game can be. 

Thought the game was too easy when you got the upper hand? Not here, aliens run their own research so it is a constant arms race against an intelligent foe you must adapt to

Thought some classes were useless like medic and snipers over powered? Now everyone is overpowered in their own way you better bring a balanced team though because every soldier, if you properly equip and upgrade them has their uses

Thought most of the equipment is useless? It still kind of is but they certainly help. Never leave home without an acid grenade. 

Thought mechanics were simple? Unless you learn how DR and defence works prepare to get 1 shotted with 25 damage crits. 

Thought upgrades are simple? By early game each unit has about 1-2 abilities that are unique by mid game each class is defined in what they do best and ranges they do it best. By late game your units and enemies have entire spreadsheets worth of abilities and passives you better know almost all of them because elite units need some galaxy brain moves to take down 

Thought most of the fancy abilities like suppression fire and sentinel overwatch were un necessary? Good luck winning a single mission without suppression fire and multiple sentinel overwatch users


Thought the aerial combat was almost pointless? Not here, you send squads of planes with expanded weapons and positions in the air. If you do not keep up in the air, the ai will adjust and will just bomb cities into oblivion before your ground troops can even touch an alien cheek

MORE CLASSES MORE TECHS MORE ABILITIES, in base game you got psionics upgrade, genetics and MEC soldier upgrade paths, here there are also officer upgrade paths which gives you FREE ACTIONS. You get to much more information aliens have abilities and similar to your classes. This imo is a direct upgrade on long war mod. 

At the time of writing, I am 288 hours in. I have just took down the command UFO I have about %20 more of the game to go at least and while it can get frustrating with bugs, you can debug lots of things with console commands. This is hands down the best XCOM experience ever 

Protip: Just like in base game RNG  works on a seed basis that is set at the start, restarting the mission rerolls it so if you want to play ironman, select bronzeman option so you do not get screwed over by unfair RNG ( all of your shots miss while %5 to hit shots by aliens crit etc) .",1650653816,1650653816,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The last time, I've encountered this many gamebreaking bugs, was when I tried launching gothic 1. Sure, you can argue, that bugs are random, but I do not see myself going back to play this game.
The story is basically; defend earth for 30 hours and you get 3 gamemodes: kill aliens, defuse a bomb and extract a person of interest. The soundtrack consists of about 3 tracks. Even though, they're good, they get stale after about 10 hours. The graphics have aged pretty poorly, but that mostly stems from the artstyle. The gameplay, while engaging enough to make you want to play with strategy, falls apart through the difficulty. You can literally kill the final boss within one turn on the normal difficulty. Increasing the difficulty doesn't make it more difficult to play the game, it just messes up the chances of hitting a target. This way, you feel like playing a luck-based game instead of a strategy based one. A more difficult option would have been, fighting from a less ideal spawn, being forced into a disadvantageous position and overcoming it. Rather than fighting with soldiers, who haven't hit a shot in 6 turns, immeadiately panic and shoot their teammates.
I just wish, it had more enemy types, music and strategic difficulties. All in all 4/10.",1650574761,1650574761,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- There is no asymmetric vision. If you spot enemies, they spot you and vice versa
- The camera controls are meh. I just want to be able to lock the camera at a certain angle but the game won't give me that.
- The economy is dumb. the worse you play (and slower you progress the main story), the stronger your soldiers end up. Research is bottlenecked by items never research time. If you have normal human levels of skill you will end up progressing the main story way too quickly and be vastly underequipped for enemies.

-Don't try to get everything perfect, just own your mistakes and move on.
-Build Satelites, really, just get that cash flowing.
-Flanking is in the game for a reason, nearly every time I lost an operative it was because of a dumb move on my part, not rng.

I had to kill the game using the task manager. Lost the progress. And there are other bugs as well, like getting stuck in a black loading screen, for instance. Other than that, the game is hard, and in a bad sense. It is a ""miss"" festival. Two of your best soldiers and a sniper, all of them fully upgraded, all of them in overwatch, all of them trying to hit an enemy running in the open, no cover at all, and all of them miss. And then the enemy gets close and hits for a critical killing one of your soldiers. You'll see ""miss"" even when above 95%, even if it is your sniper aiming. That's ok provided it is rare, however high percentage misses are too frequent to be tolerated. In contrast, your troops will be hit even when they are in full cover and using hunker down. A miss in a turn based game means you waste your time since you have to wait till next turn to do another action with that character. A quite unlikable and outdated feature to people who have something else to do with their lives beyond playing video-games.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An ode to the best game ever made
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I started the mission and found a small sectoid.
Threw it a flashbang and left it quite annoyed.
Its friend cast a mind merge, another cast mindfray...
Next time I hope rookies have HEs to go play.

Then came a drone, buzzing high in the sky,
The rookies took shots, might as well flung a pie.
The rounds barely made it past damage reduction...
Next time I'll bring a sniper to the abduction.

Then came a tense bomb disposal with thin men.
With motion trackers I planned everything, when
out of their mouths came a poisonous acid...
Next time more med kits will make everything placid.

Then came end of March a shiny landed scout.
Rookies asked for a chance and I gave them a shout...
...but they couldn't hit flying floaters if they tried.
Next time I'll send gunners to suppress their pride.

Then came full on terror - a chryssalid pack!
They ran at civilians, then all the way back.
I thought that my scout was sat out of their range...
Next time I will bring CCS for a change.

Then came the appearance of many a seeker.
They'll strangle, we'll alt+o, couldn't be weaker...
...except for that one hidden on overwatch.
Next time lightning reflexes prevents a botch.

Then came the outsider in shining bright orange,
One run-and-gun shotgun and he's now a lozenge.
Except that all pods then converged on the scene...
Next time activate LAST or you might lose a spleen.

Then came the green muton, hulking his great bulk,
Shot him down to one health then he raged in a sulk.
The panic check failed, soldier died the next turn.
Next time don't neglect Steadfast, so onward I learn.

Then came the majesty of a cyberdisc.
It flew high, all shots missed, we were at major risk.
One grenade, cover gone, quite tempting to resign...
Next time holo + heat leaves no reason to whine.

Then appeared the mechtoid on its overwatch.
Caught out of position, my team needs a scotch.
Now shielded by sectoids, we've not enough power..
Next time disabling prevents things turning sour.

Then came the beserker charging at full sprint,
I shot it fives times but it didn't take the hint.
So stoked with DR I just couldn't kill them.
Next time I will research and bring along chem.

Then came the high will of a sectoid commander.
Out mech mind controlled: we couldn't understand her.
Hidden back behind indestructible high cover...
Next time I will psi inspire them like a lover.

Then came the throw range of high heavy floater,
With bombard it reached our team sat by the motor.
A stray shot blew up the remainder of the truck.
Next time there's a wall further back with some luck.

Then came the red blaze of a muton elite,
Need corpses for rigging, so we're happy to meet.
Except that I can't hit through their innate defence.
Next time bring more psi, least that's my ten cents.

Then came a massive stomping black sectopod,
One disable later, I looked to the squad.
They fired and whittled it, but drones repaired...
Next time blast the drones first and mechs will be spared.

Then finally came the ethereal threat,
It was the toughest encounter I had yet.
It ran and it lanced and it rift and we died.
Next time I'll ask reddit, well, after I've cried.",1648198695,1648198695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once you'd played Final Fantasy Tactics (or Tactics Ogre, which several developers who worked for Square had made before working on FFT), you'd really played them all. 

XCOM: Enemy Within is the only successful game I've seen within that specific field (excluding RTS games) that has done anything new, and it's done it well. I don't think I'd even played a turn-based strategy game since 2003, when Disgaea came out, and it was so anime-bland that I just stopped completely. Most of what's being (re)introduced in XCOM: EU, and it's expansion, Enemy Within, is so far left of the typical gist of these types of games that it usually takes a few short, sweet, and most importantly FAILED, runs to get a total grasp on the mechanics and how to use them properly to beat the game. 

There is, however, a lack of dynamic design in enemies you'll encounter. Even old games (and their ripoffs) like FFT have some differentiation because of the classic Job/Class system, whereas in XCOM there's only roughly 10 enemy types with one or more variations. Even then you'd think the maybe 16 total different potential enemies that you'd encounter would be enough, but I can assure you, it gets repetitive FAST. 

XCOM also has an RNG system like other turn-based strategy games, but seems to force you to accept whatever decision it's made about how each shot will connect. You could reload a save 20 times and always get the same result. This seems PERFECT for the genre, but let me tell you, as you get started playing, whatever methodology going on under the hood to determine if a shot misses seems pretty janky, at best. Other games (like XCOM 2) have attempted to remedy this. 

Where this game shines brightest is how each turn is laid out. Unlike so many games before it, XCOM has the player determine what each unit will do before their turn ends. You can no longer game the system so easily by improving some arbitrary stat like haste and correcting each misstep because you'll have a unit ready to prevent a troop from dying because only a single enemy unit has had the opportunity to attack. It's do or die, and really forces the player to engage on a new level of planning to win a single game. This alone, sets XCOM apart from every other turn-based strategy game on the market.

The game also lacks any sense of ambiance. You could argue that the slow nature of the game effectively acts as ambiance, but the sound board begs to differ. It honestly reminds me of an old 1990s video games where you ambiance was the accompanying battle music. 

There's also a extremely high quality mod for this game called The Long War (which members of Firaxis Studios, who made XCOM: EU/EW, helped work on) that adds a Cinematic Mode where shots miss less. I think for my next playthrough I'd just use that, because, man, with proper ability point allocation and planning, in-the-field strategies like flanking (a very basic mechanic, not nearly the meta these types of games can offer) can quickly seem completely useless.

8/10

If you can pick up multiple XCOM entries as part of a single Steam sale like I did, then buy it. Otherwise, buy XOM 2 instead, the updated procedurally generated maps alone are enough of a reason to pass on Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within and jump straight into the sequel.",1647775573,1647822709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

XCOM: Enemy Within is a separate game in its own right, and is essentially an expansion of the original.

Maybe that one achievement, Ironman - you would need to play 5 times through. One day I might get that one. But that's achievement hunter babble.

If you played since the 90s, you probably know XCOM already. 1994 the first game came out.
I was hooked immediately. The misterious aliens. I need to study them - for that, I need to kill them first, of course.
Not many games had such an atmosphere. It was very hard to play. For that, I like that you can put it on the same level, should you dare. 

XCom: Enemy unknown is not quite there - but comes very near in terms of atmosphere.
Even the graphics are not bad, considering it is from 2012. Many games before 2013 have horrid graphics from today's point of view. 

Bit by bit you shoot UFOs, make extraterrestrial reasearch, study them. ""What, you want one alive? How the heck? - Okay..."" Later in the game, there is also a surprise event. As you progress, your armory/technology gets better and you have amazing options how to progress. you can a) make genetic modifications in your agents b) cybernetic/robotic modifications. Both options are just great. Amazing to see that in action.

What else? Ah well, it's turn based.
As I did not yet play either Xcom2, nor Chimera Squad, as of now, I can't make comparisons.
But I have both in my library and might update my review.

If you are a fan of turn- based sci-fi strategy titles, this might be a good start into the franchise.
Starting at XCOM 2 might also be an option. I can't tell, but I am eager to know what it's like.
Chimera Squad is said to be a spin off.
There is another title, something with ""xcom bureau"" which you should avoid at all costs.

Using the unconventional tactic breaching my way into a ship, via the blaster launcher and flight suits (to avoid Chryssalids) was fun to say the least.  Boarding an alien ship always had the foreboding fear of instant death for my soldiers; as turning a corner and coming face to face with a Chryssalid was enough to make a full grown man cry. Death was mostly inevitable at this point for the unlucky bastard who had such an encounter.  I also miss the different forms of fire (snap, auto and aimed) a soldier could take to gun down extraterrestrial enemies.

There is a focus on turn based strategy here, but luck plays a bigger role. 

I've been next to an enemy several times with a 97% hit chance and missed. I've also had 27% hit chance several times and killed the enemy.

Skill doesn't play much of a factor. Yes, increasing your hit chance by adjusting position and weapon load out can affect the outcome. But never enough that I'm not crossing my fingers before every shot.

You might like XCOM. Many play to this day. Just know that your success will largely be decided not by your ability as a player, but by a random number generator outside of your control.

This game is the greatest strategy game I have played so far. It is better even than the sequel (XCOM 2, which I am currently progressing to beat). Gameplay and story will be fascinating for any fan of sci-fi turn-based strategies. The RNG system regarding actions, like shooting, is often frustrating, but also very rewarding and satisfying equally frequently. The game in general is quite difficult and requires a lot of patience, sacrifice, and strategic and tactical skill in order to reach the end. I, personally, had problems even on the easiest difficulty. But I consider that an asset.

And the Enemy Within DLC adds lots of new and original concepts, like soldier genetic and cybernetic modification, or the new EXALT threat - an organization, which tries its strength to baffle XCOM and its plans to save the planet.

I would love to criticize this reboot based on the original series to have a more objective point of view, but unfortunately, I did not obtain those games. If I ever manage to lay my hands on the original games, I will try and update this review.",1645997887,1645997887,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, from a 2022 perspective I do wish I had played this game when it originally came out. I can see how back when it was released this game was a breath of fresh air.

Graphics are decent, if outdated by 2022 and the facial animation is again definitely of its time, but the environments are crisp and the effects still hold up well. The animation of the various aliens and characters are fantastic.

The story is standard alien-invasion fare with a couple of twists and turns to keep you interested. I would definitely recommend that if you're playing this game in 2022+ to make sure to play with the Expansion content 'Enemy Within' as it adds further missions and interesting scenarios to the original's storyline.

The game-play is where XCOM continues to shine in comparison to other games. The gameplay is strategic and every move you make, unless you're a save-fantatic, can be fraught with peril as it could lead to the death of a well-loved squad member. This is especially true late-game as the enemies become tougher and deal more damage. The abilities available and the range of different soldiers you recruit lead to a huge range of different options during the scenarios. The addition of the 'Enemy Within' content further widens the tools you get to play with to the point where you can approach any scenario differently every time with different soldiers and abilities and loadouts.

You will sometimes get attacked or have the opportunity to attack UFOs which requires you to deploy your aircraft. I do wish this was a bit more strategic than just watching your plane duke it out against the UFO as it led to me rushing to get the better aircraft available mid-game. Once you've got those, the UFO problems disappear.

The base-building, research, weapon manufacturing, satelliate placement etc during the base section of the game was also interesting. During the early to mid-game, the order you build, the satelliates you place and the research you carry out can have a bearing on the difficulty of the missions in the late-game.

For my part, without given spoilers away, I did find I was able to 'cheat' the game slightly and managed to make it in to the final mission with my soldiers fully powered up, tech'd up and kitted out for most the aliens to be no trouble at all.

Which leads to me stating exactly why I would recommend this game in 2022, but with a caveat. The game is still as strategic as it was when it was released and holds up well today. The graphics and story are decent but nothing to write home about. The game was definitely enhanced for me with the additional content from 'Enemy Within'. The caveat being that the game does become very repetitive. I found myself waiting and waiting for research and manufacturing to be completed, which by the late-game began to be drawn out. I had nothing left to do but wait and run through random missions thrown at me by the game. I had no use for Invasions as I didn't require any more money or soldiers. As you can imagine, this became tedious and started to drag the latter part of the game which feels like something that probably shouldn't happen in 2022. This is a shame as until then I had enjoyed the game.

So I recommend that if you haven't yet, play this game at least once! The gameplay holds up, but be aware the late-game can drag if you're like me and, as a RPGamer, I want everything I can find. Missions can become repetitive but the strategic options open to you can keep it from becoming entirely stale. That being said make sure you do purchase/play with the 'Enemy Within' content.",1645630957,1645630957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

XCOM was going through some changes, BIG things; the Psionics Lab was working overtime to assess all high-ranking officers and recruits for psionic capabilities; having several dozens of missions under their belt, the most vetted and elite operatives came forward, not a one below Colonel rank.. This was no ordinary squad however... each soldier had seen their whole squad wiped out before their eyes (being on ironman mode) and came out on top- from eagle-eyed Snipers to Heavy indirect fire support the team was solid.. or so I thought. Standard issue for this playthrough of XCOM, each soldier was outfitted with plasma weaponry and either Titan or Archangel armor (with 2 slots ofc for an added layer of protection by nano-fiber vest...) 

Operation Burning Sword, much akin to hellfire, Muspelheim, and the Angel that guardeth Eden, ended in f******* disaster. Not a single operative would make it back alive... Genetically modified supersoldiers, down to their secondary hearts (to prevent death on loss of all health) and Neural modifications to negate mind-controlling effects, they had never met an enemy they couldn't defeat... until the dark day.. until i realized that sending them in to be assessed by the Psi-Labs UNEQUIPPED their weapons... The snipers could only pew pew away with focused lethality and anticlimatic bullets worth 3 damage against relentless mutons with 10HP and flying mechanized enemies that always got that elevation hit bonus, shooting through the smoke cloud of my support with derision.. before he could make the extra blue-grid movement to stabilize the fallen Assault class, ""Axle"", the codename lovingly chosen by some higher power upon his promotion to SGT class, would be mowed down and left to bleed out as the flying enemies outflanked, harassed, and made lucky/skillful plays against my elites. Behind a door and away from the main conflict, the Snipers kept up their barrage with their pew pew S*** rifles instead of with the precision and power of their normally-issued heavy plasma sniper rifles.. Col Wilson emptied her clip in a checkers-esque use of killing enemies outside of cover (as drones are wont to do) only to switch to her pistol too late, as a Mechtoid hidden from view in a stairway not 10 feet away (it was the elevation difference that hid it from LOS) emptied it's clip in a friendly hello.. because that f****r had to be smiling sentient AI or no I felt it smile.. One by one, my 6-man elite squad, invested in, recruited, trained, and vetted in the fire and anvil of futuristic warfare, bled out TURN BY TURN with nobody to revive them. ""Alpha"", a soldier from Norway, was first to fall. ""Axle"", support from the US, got a faceful of mechtoid rounds for his efforts to stabilize his fallen comrade.. ""Zulu"" the aforementioned sniper that never got to return the hello, was the proverbial puddle in the rear.. the other sniper died as well.. panic sets in, I groan, and I watch with horror as ""Mad Man"" got taken out by a Sectopod from it's maximum range volley attack... the Heavy ""Diesel"" would shortly follow, her bonus dmg against robotics enemies being unmet potential as none of her shots failed to connect at a mere 55% hit chance.. but that was all I could really do. Again, I watched in horror as the massive cannon carved a giant hole in her stomach.. *Beep, Beep* the sound went as another operative lay bleeding out and dying.. Jesus Castillo AKA Desperado was the last one from the whole squad, and as much as I would like to say he died valiantly, like a man yet not quite the savior I hoped he would be, I can't blame him for it... When he got lasered to the brain, I couldn't weep, I couldn't angrily beat the desk holding the monitor in front of me.. I must've stared at that screen, my best 6 ""guys"" KIA in a routine mop-up mission against a downed UFO.. and when you get WIPE WIPED, the voice actor who plays Central (the only other one apart from the german chick and engineer dude that you can hear true soul in,) calls STATUS BLACK CONFIRMED.. and right then my heart broke and a little piece of me died inside...
10/10 would pew pew again and watch the world burn before I'd have let ""Prophet"" die... my extensive use of skipping missions until I had scouted a full Psionic party gave me a horrific call from the Council I'm not likely to forget D:

I recommend this game because it IS a good game. And it actually is a very good remake of the original 1994 game. I was actually hit with nostalgic blast from the past when reading some of research information. Some of those lines were took directly from the original. Very nice touch.
However I'm a tad disappointed by some of the changes to game mechanics. 
1.	One base. In original game I setup numerous bases. Some with radar and interceptors. Other purely for storage. This allowed for more freedom of choice and. Here you are restricted to just one location based on continent.
2.	One assault craft. In original you could research advanced assault craft with bigger troop capacity. This allowed for bigger battles with more soldiers.
3.	No more action points. In original each soldier had a number of Aps determined by his stats. This allowed for precise planning: move 2 spaces, pick up plasma rifle, take aimed shot. Here you just have 2 actions. This feels like a restriction rather than improvement.
4.	Soldiers don’t have inventory. This one is tragic. A soldier is given a scope and therefore cannot have a grenade? Oh come on!!
5.	Unlimited ammo. Oh come on!! In original you needed to have ammo in your inventory. You had to manage it. That was much more realistic and deep. Here you can reload as much as you want. Too much simplification!

In summary: while I enjoy playing this game I feel its too scripted for a proper strategy and too simplified for a proper tactical combat game.",1644919716,1644919857,True,1,0,0.481680065393447876,0,True,False,False

The overall atmosphere  is a brutal game even on normal setting. I would compare this game vibe align more with darkest dungeon and maybe Divinity 2 but it is an alien invasion.  let's break down the game in more of components of quality which are graphics, lore, game play, stability and price.

Graphics: The graphics in the game has aged great. It still competitive to modern standard that come out today. Maybe not as good as Dark Souls but is more isometric hybrid with some animation cut scene that flow quite well as the story tickers along. I did see any weird graphical bugs that was ridiculous or just creepy.

                                                                           **minor spoilers***
Lore: The story take place on earth but alien have invaded earth and The X-Com has been hired as elite bad asses to eradicate the enemy. But we (human beings) do not why they are here and though out mission is to collect evidence and learn from these aliens.

Game play: It turns out that this is a unforgiving difficult game with military type tactics which find to be plausible .This is turn_based game with very steep learning curve. just find cover and where to place on where to place the soldiers for cover can be very sobering learning experience. But nothing is satisfying than killing, seek and destroy the egg -head shaped aliens. The game also has a base building feature to improve the the soldier's weapons and gear.I find that to be most relaxing, The soldiers are sent out  4 man..mankind squad team. combat is intense and do not get too attached to your heroes because they will die =(. luckily the you can always buy more meat shields..I mean soldiers to add to your roster.

Stability: It crashed once but nothing game breaking. Although there was a time one of soldier was would not move anywhere but that might of been a condition and not bug. It has a turn based fluidity so do not expect too many bugs even 
on older machines.

Price: Wait for it to go on sale. This game may not be your cup of tea. It is not everyone but that depends on the Eye Of The Beholder.

Overall: The game is fun but must the gamer must  have thick skin. I tried it, and it sobered me up but I sure there is audience that love game. give it chance and I am sure there is wonderful experience if one is patient.

Gameplay missions are boring to play. Early-game is a matter of stat checking your squad, with their guns and explosives, against the aliens, and late-game encourages you to fight as uninteractively as possible by thinning the aliens with snipers, then finishing them off with assaults.

Once you finish the mission, you can rank up your soldiers to give them skills, but there is no decision-making involved. One of the two skills is better than the other.

Research has a clear, ideal research path, removing it as an outlet for the player to make decisions. No game situation can alter the ideal research path.

Engineering is done well. Resources are scarce enough so you need to choose who you want to equip with the newest equipment first, however, once you equip your soldiers, it becomes a non-mechanic.

Creating the base in a grid is a well-designed system, but there aren't enough buildings to make base design something of much consideration past the very early game.

The difficulty curve of the game is highly early game weighted, which makes no sense. People installing the game will experience 1-2 months in game of difficult (stat checking) encounters, followed by 4 months of boring repetitive gameplay.

The story is non-existent, or unclear at best. Somehow the developers managed to go to [i]XCOM: 2[/i] without retconning any of the “story”, but all of the “story” is just shoehorned in on literally the last mission.

The one redeeming feature is the animations. It’s hard to not cheer on your soldiers when they take a shot against the aliens, but this novelty eventually becomes tedious, as there’s no way to skip the animation. Additionally, the customization available to your soldiers does matter, and you can have unique soldiers who may be named after your friends (though, maybe don’t tell them that).

Overall, [i]XCOM: Enemy Unknown[/i] and its accompanying expansion [i]Enemy Within[/i] abstracts away too much of the strategy in this “strategy game” in favor of admittedly flashy animations and customizable characters. I don’t recommend you play this game. If you want a better experience play [i]XCOM: 2[/i] which expands on every mechanic.",1644077483,1644177175,False,2,0,0.520512819290161133,0,True,False,False

It's a masterfully simplified re-imagining of a classic turn-based strategy game with an engaging gameplay loop that is very well tutorialized and easy to understand. Maybe you've never touched a game like this in your life, but you may just discover your new favorite time sink here.

Fan of tactical/strategy games? You've probably played XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but if you haven't then you should. Its simplified interface and tactical systems belie a surprising amount of strategic depth both in missions and in the long term base management game. And if that's not enough for you, a bevy of unlockable Second Wave options and the developer recommended Long War mod can add thousands of hours to a game that can already easily steal 400 hours from you.


Positives

- Stimulating gameplay loop: Go out on missions, kill aliens, get better materials, build better weapons, kill bigger aliens. It's the stuff dreams are made of, and it's addictive as all get-out.

- Tactical depth: An easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master turn-based movement and combat system, combined with ruthless enemy AI and a decent variety of maps make for hundreds and thousands of hours of alien killing fun

- Enemy unknown: An interesting enemy force to face and learn about through the research tree along with a decent story will spice up your first playthrough at the very least, although the cutscenes leave a lot to be desired


Negatives

- Jankiness: No game works perfectly, and this game is no exception. After 500 hours with it, I've encountered a lot of glitches related to line of sight and a few related to critical wound stabilization that killed a particularly important Ironman run for me. I've had to reinstall it a couple of times as well.

- Difficulty: I like my hard games, but difficulty can be a double-edged sword and XCOM seems to enjoy straddling the razor. An XCOM campaign's first couple of months are the most challenging, followed by a nice breezy middle few months, and wrapped up with a moderately challenging final stretch of missions, and this wonky difficulty curve is only further exaggerated on higher difficulty levels.

- Story execution: This is a minor nitpick, but the attempts to characterize your three main helper people in the cutscenes as part of a larger story were, I don't know... misguided maybe?

This was my first game from the X-Com/UFO Franchise, but certainly not my first Turn Based Tactics Game. And it ticked all the right boxes! Although not being exactly beginner friendly, once you get a grip at everything, it's very satisfying. It kind of strikes a perfect balance between challenging you to the point of frustration, then makes it up to you by being very rewarding if you succeed. An admittedly delicate balance, but they pulled it off. It keeps you on your toes most of the time and the moments of victory are so satisfying, since you've really earned them! Clever tactics really pay off and high-risk manoeuvres provide high rewards, IF they succeed. Very well done.
The RTS part of base building is a nice addition but could have been more transparent in the beginning. It's fun, has a huge impact on your success and really adds to the game. But early mistakes can spoil it a bit. Also, they really managed to grow a connection with your team. You choose them, you develop them, you don’t want to lose them! Weapons-, Mod- and Skill systems also work very well and lets you create a team after your taste, whatever that may be.

The only drawback in terms of balancing is, when you stay patient and try to complete as much as you can on the world map, before progressing the main story parts, you will reach a tipping point where you become a bit OP. The game has some mechanics, that’ll push you, make you hurry and rush… if you can manage to not give in, you’ll become quite strong in the second half or late game.

Overall, a fantastic Turn Based Tactics Game! One of the best in my opinion.

 [u]Pros:[/u]

- very good, but borderline balance between challenge and reward
- nice story, actually (no, really…yes, alien invasion and the likes, seen a hundred times, but this is actually ok)
- the constant change between combat missions and base building / research adds welcome variety
- good design, at least I personally like it
- good balance between turn based tactics combat and real-time base building
- individual team members really grow on you
- base building is fun, once you get a grip on it
- mostly good and reliable combat mechanics

 [u]Cons:[/u]

-  can be very challenging & frustrating at times
- patience required, you need to like this sort of game
- base building could be better explained
- hit chances sometimes feel a bit off, not according to the numbers (just bad luck?)

 [u]Tipps:[/u]

-although it is designed to lose people in combat, I played without a single lost team member (except for the tutorial, which is impossible to avoid), so it’s possible and very rewarding to never loose anybody. It requires a lot of repetition and patience but is possible. Try at least, as it will make your team stronger and save resources no needing to recruit, develop and teach new members for it!
- resist the pressing urge, the game creates in base building mode. Be quick, when necessary, but take your time when possible. It’s worth it in the second half!

If you want a tactical game, I'd suggest skipping it in favour of a more robust gameplay experience like licking a flagpole on a cold winter day. If you want to play some kind of janky gun chess where cover only covers if you have your gigantic side of beef chest pressed against it and concealment doesn't meaningfully exist, maybe get it on a deeply discounted Steam sale.

When everything works and your squad actually hits their targets, your plan works and you have enough money and resources to upgrade... that's when you get into the flow of just one more round, one more mission, one more research project. And to be fair, that's the majority of the time - depending on the difficulty you select of course and potentially a lot more punishing in 'Iron Man' mode where you only have one save game!

But there is also the,more frustrating side of the game. It's when you trigger a swarm of enemies by just moving your character one tile too far. Or, my 'favorite', when the game spawns opponents behind your position out of thin air. And speaking of favorites, those panic missions where you need to rescue civilians, are by far my least fun part of the game.

As far as content goes, the base game 'Enemy Unknown' is already plenty long but you really want to get the 'Enemy Within' DLC as it easily doubles the size and adds a ton of new research and upgrade options to the game. Not to mention another faction, new mission types and all in all a lot more depth to an already great game.

First off, the gameplay isn't just centered around creating some characters, finding or creating goodies for them, leveling them up, and completing missions. There's all this side crap you have to do, and this is what absolutely kills the game for me. You have to fund, build, and maintain rooms in the human base. The same goes for aircraft and a satellite network (all of which I consider to be timed since, if you wait too long, some major catastrophe will happen).  You also have to spend resources controlling ""panic"" around the globe (more panic equals less money for you). So, while you're spending all of your hard earned loot on this garbage, your characters are faced with tougher missions, and now lack the weapons, supplies, and armor to get the job done. I was constantly losing all of my decent soliders because of this, and frankly, that is just bad game design. 

To a lesser degree, I also don't agree with the fact that you can't choose what class to make a particular soldier. Um, if my sniper gets killed, I really want another sniper; don't force my new recruit into being an assault class. There is literally no reason for the game to do this type of thing.

Finally, there's the difficulty level. I've been playing this on the easiest level and it's frickin' insane. Even with the best armor, weapons, gizmos, and abilities, my team was constantly getting their asses handed to them by severely overpowered enemies. If you're looking for challenge, not impossibility, then this game is not for you. 

Sorry, folks. I know everyone thinks XCOM is one of the best games ever, but I'm disagreeing. Take all that junk out and you'd have yourself a winning game. Right now, at best, it's a 6/10.",1511322369,1640989992,False,0,0,0.383521944284439087,0,True,False,False

Xcom:Apocolypse was better in some ways;  there was a sense of real mystery as the maps were huge and you never knew if you really had gotten rid of the aliens on maps.  This open-endedness continued in later maps when you could eventually travel to the alien's realm.   In Xcom: Enemy Unknown, the missions are more clearly defined in the sense that it's urgent that you eliminate or capture aliens at each encounter.   Because if you don't eliminate or capture, there are serious ""political"" consequences that directly effect your ability to advance and build your technology and resources.

There are 2 big key components to the game, the first one is the management of the base and the second is the tactical combat. 

The management of the base is simple but offers enough to be interesting and rewarding with research, crafting items, upgrading items, building rooms, recruit and train units and augmenting and enhancing units both added with Enemy Within. Early on, the higher the difficulty the more important the decisions on where to spend the limited resources available making a significant difference during missions which is important for an engaging experience in my opinion. Something about this game makes character customisation compelling, it's not very in-depth unfortunately the more characters the easier it gets to see that they start to look the same but creating your own squad of characters is fun nonetheless to make the experience that much more unique.

For the tactical combat, the gameplay is fun and doesn't over-complicate itself remaining on an easy to understand level mechanically while requiring more on the strategy side. I feared the RNG would be rough but thankfully It's exaggerated and while the occasional streaks of bad luck do feel like everything is going wrong the amount of good hits landed vastly overshadow the missed hits. I believe my overall accuracy was around 75% so it's fair to say the RNG is actually player-favoured and simply having a good strategy will make the biggest difference at the end of the day. When it comes down to the camera I have a small problem with it in closed spaces with elevation when moving units sometimes it's necessary to rotate the camera at the right angle to get the desired tile highlighted which in the early hours made things a bit annoying since I had to reload a few times. The auto-save system is a bit buggy, it randomly stopped working at times and did overwrite some recently made auto-saves when reloading resulting in frustration and some lost time so I simply went back to my habit of manually saving a lot. Those are minor issues however, repetition is probably the flaw I can see some people disliking and it comes from the maps and enemies thankfully with Enemy Within more maps and mission types are added. The enemies are not bad but it's simply that most of them can be handled the same and all of their variants are essentially the same but with better stats so the strategy is kind of identical throughout the course of the game. I can't say it made the game any less enjoyable but I did notice how I wouldn't think much anymore when I was mid-game because I already met the first iteration of every alien so the rest weren't much different to handle. Aside from those small flaws which may not affect most players it's satisfying to do missions as they give off this uneasy feeling of exploring the unknown with the creepy ambient sounds and atmosphere it suits really well the theme of an alien invasion with the saucers and the aliens with the big eyes and slender body in a space suit so well done on overall.

To conclude, pretty good game for someone looking for a turn-based strategy game with some base management on the side and the setting was surprisingly more interesting to me than I anticipated given how simple it looks I did expect that, it was probably helped a lot by the atmosphere of the unknown alien threat that was well executed. 9/10 I also highly recommend to get Enemy Within as well for the added content to make for a great experience.",1639622730,1639622798,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First X-Com game was released in 1994, and my first gaming experience was X-Com: Terror from the deep that was released in 1995. After that first contact with X-Com, I was bought, I had to try out every of those. Sure, not of all X-Com games are good, some are plain bad (The Bureau: X-COM Declassified for example), but it rarely happens that some gaming serial does not have a black sheep of the family.

X-Com Enemy Unknown is actually a very good game. The game is divided into two phases. You have your base of operation that you can build and upgrade, and then there is actual action when something happens, you go with your team and need to fight off aliens in excellently made turn-based fights. For me, a very positive thing was that game wasn't based only on territory of USA. It is interesting how many TV-Shows and movies actually suggest that aliens would invade only USA. The rest of the world is basically never ever mentioned. So I liked it very much when you can engage the aliens through out the globe.

Also the fighting which is the most important part of the game is very intuitive, with some nice touches of new ideas, that became standard afterwards for turn-based games. (Like ambush option for example). Also there is a lot of cover on every battlefield that is actually useful. Some missions are very hard, but the winning them is so much sweater. I still didn't play X-Com 2, but it is on my ""To play"" list. If you maybe missed this game, I can only recommend it, you will not regret any minute of it. There is also an alternative to X:Com Enemy Unknown, it is game called Xenonauts. But it is basically poor man's X-Com game.",1639069631,1639211420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My main problem with XCOM is repetition. The battles are decent fun at first but they lack variety in both terrain and enemies. The tactical level was far shallower than I was expecting. You'd think destructible terrain and a versatile cover/flanking system would lead to interesting battles but often they just... don't. Your soldiers are slow, fragile, and inconsistent fighters at best, especially in the early game when you're learning the ropes. This encourages careful, conservative strategies which never really lose their effectiveness despite being mind-numbingly tedious. Luring aliens into ambushes loses its luster rather quickly. Don't get me wrong, fun and surprising things can happen, but so many of my battles were one-sided slaughters (not always in my favor, of course). This would all be fine if XCOM was a much shorter game, but in a 20-30 hour campaign its gameplay wears thin rather quickly. Seen one crashed UFO in a forest, seen 'em all.

I've heard plenty about the famous XCOM rng over the years. I didn't have much of a problem with it tbh. I had a few moments where I missed 95% chance shots or hit 10% shots, so it balanced itself out. Thankfully the aliens are just as vulnerable to bad rng. It does contribute to the conservative playstyle I mentioned above, however. Why bother with close combat when I can lure enemies into my sniper's line of sight for guaranteed hits and massive damage? Taking risks feels too, well, *risky* in most scenarios.

The base-building and strategy components feel pretty good. You research technology, construct upgrades, facilities, and weapons, and you manage XCOM's funding and diplomatic relationships. None of this is especially deep but it's enough to be engaging. I really enjoyed the feeling of mastering the alien tech and gaining intel on my enemies -- the journey from Enemy Unknown to Enemy Known Inside and Out is XCOM's strongest aspect by far. The actual story is pretty straightforward. ""Understand the aliens, kill the aliens"" works perfectly well for a game like this, so I have no complaints here.

Overall, as I've said, I don't hate XCOM: Enemy Unknown. But its pitfalls ultimately outweigh the things I like, so I can't recommend it. I understand why so many people like it so much but it's just not for me. I've heard XCOM 2 fixes a lot of issues, but frankly I'm not interested in continuing the series.",1638914004,1638914004,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spectacular turn-based strategy game. Great graphics and sound assets, good story from start to finish, plausible / pragmatic, with short but concise cut-scenes that do a nice job of setting the tone for the game-play. 

True to the original X-COM it's very unforgiving and challenging to the very end. It implements a tactical turn-based combat system - in isometric view - which is really quite fluid and adds to the immersive, cerebral experience.

If you units move too fast into uncharted territory, if you don't mind cover and lines of sight judiciously, if you spread your squads too thin across too many theaters of a firefight, you will lose units. These units are easily replaceable, but their skills not so much, and the time invested in developing them - as well as the emergent stories of their role in the campaign, which aren't narrated but can easily grow on the player - are not at all. Cultivating a squad of veterans, particularly in the higher difficulties, requires caution, temperance, and luck. 

At the same time, the game is quite good at stimulating tension and impelling the player forward despite the risks here. Managing the global politics of the XCOM project often forces the player to take on tougher missions than ideal for the circumstances in order to prevent panic from spiraling out of control and the withdrawal of nations from XCOM. The Enemy Within expansion (which I fully recommend) adds a valuable resource needed for advanced soldier augmentations, Meld, which must be found on the map before it expires in a random number of turns. Saving civilians in terror missions, and doing any good at it, means getting to them before the aliens do and using your own troops to draw their focus instead. 

Purely as a strategy and tactics experience, XCOM is quite nice. It also has an excellent story, graphical aesthetic, and soundtrack to boot - and while the game is (visibly) nearing on ten years old, that experience remains quite a trip. If you are fond of tactics, squad-building, unpredictable challenges, and shadowy organizations dealing with aliens, XCOM is a game for you.",1638327994,1638327994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Said so, it is a great game but definitely get the DLC, since it adds so much more tactical opportunities.
The battles are great, the enemies all unique and the base building combined with the world panic management really adds some flavor on what you want to focus.
Seeing how your soldiers become stronger, the story, how u finally get the situation under control and push the aliens back gets quiet addicting. The 30h you need to complete the game are just perfect tho.

Just remember to save every turn of combat because the the possible hit roles are allready determined at the start of the round (at least for visible enemies).

Had a save with a 95% hitchance on a big bot to stun him vor capture. Reloaded that save around 15 times and it never worked.

Another thing to note is ALWAYS stay in cover. ALWAYS!!!!

The AI can and will cheat. Enemy round starts - still not seen enemy moves almost his full movement distance - said enemy enters your viewrange - enemy gets another full movement to his preferred cover.

So ALWAYS use cover and activate sentry mode, when you have nothing to shoot or just a low hitchance.

I'm generally very wary of reboots because they're usually terrible, and most of the current wave of reboots of classic 90s games have been abysmal cash grabs.  This game is the exception.  This game does NOT play like the original X-COM: UFO Defense from the 90s, but it is a very good game in its own right.  It's a reimagining and modernization of the core concept in the best possible way, coming up with a very different game from the original.  I was so pleased that my initial impressions from the pre-launch trailers were wrong.  This has become one of my favorite games of all time and there are very good reasons I've put 1000 hours into it.

If you've never heard of the original and are wondering why you should play this game, well, this franchise is the benchmark for the turn-based squad tactics genre.  All other games in the genre get compared to the XCOM franchise, and for good reason.  XCOM has a solid balance of squad management, RPG progression, and fun and challenging tactical missions.  You'll bemoan every failure and celebrate every success.  Victory is hard-earned and this game is not easy, but it does reward the player who learns from their mistakes and improves their tactics.

The story is perfectly paced and tied well into progression and gameplay.
But it isn't the story that is told, that is important, but the stories that are untold. Meaning the stories of your soldiers.
You'll get attached to your troopers. You'll celebrate when they perform well, get promoted and get better equipment and weep once they bite the dust. What this game did better than the sequel, is the choice to have The Chosen One be one of your soldiers, instead of you, The Commander personally. 
Despite all the quality of life improvements the sequel made, there are other choices as well, that make me to always prefer the original.

Eräs kaikkien aikojen lempipeleistäni. Enemy Within:n (sekä muiden lisäosien) kanssa entistäkin parempi. Tarina tahdittuu täydellisesti ja sulautuu luontevasti etenemiseen sekä pelattavuuteen.
Mutta itse kerrottu tarina ei ole tärkeä, vaan ne kertomatta jääneet. Siis sotilaiden tarina.
Sotilaisiinsa kiintyy. Juhlimiseen antaa aihetta heidän hyvä suorituksensa, ylennyksensä sekä uudet paremmat varusteet, kun taas sotilaan kaatuessa nousee tippa linssiin. Toisin kuin kömpelössä jatko-osassa, tässä pelissä Valittu on yksi sotilaista, eikä Komentaja, siis pelaaja, henkilökohtaisesti.

With each turn, the newest entry in this beloved strategy series heightens the sense of tension, and each defeat of a hovering alien craft thus becomes cause for celebration. But don't get too intoxicated by the faint scent of triumph: nothing is certain until you've ripped your last enemy to shreds. Getting cocky and rushing ahead is a fool's strategy, and until the alien threat is eliminated, your guard must remain up.

Enemy Unknown isn't a simple remake of the original X-COM: UFO Defense, but like that game, it cannily instills a sense of fear. Earth is under attack by aliens, and the game makes no attempts to humanize the attackers. This isn't District 9--it's The War of the Worlds, and extraterrestrial invaders are to be annihilated, not welcomed or bargained with. This might be a modern rendition of an older game, but developer Firaxis relies on old-fashioned fears to drive its narrative. Almond-eyed greys and floating saucers ripped from popular culture need no explanation: they're clearly not of this world, and they're clearly out to destroy us. And so it's up to you, the commander of the super-secretive XCOM organization, to make Earth a safe haven once again.

Gameplay is divided into two portions: base management and combat scenarios. Near the beginning of the game, you select a location for your base of operations from one of several possibilities. The choices are more limited than the ones in the original X-COM, and this is the only base you manage through the course of the game. If you're a fan of the original, being limited to a single base might seem cause for concern, as might the subsequent loss of the oft-challenging base invasions. It may not share the full breadth of the game that spawned the franchise, but it would be difficult to accuse Enemy Unknown of ""dumbing down"" the core gameplay. Nevertheless, if you crave a relentless challenge (if not quite as relentless as the nail-biting X-COM: Terror From the Deep), you should play on classic difficulty, rather than the default difficulty level.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a wonderful and worthy strategy game with a layer of campy charm that makes the stone-faced seriousness of the game's characters all the more endearing. It's also remarkably accessible, thanks to a great interface that feels comfortable whether you're using a keyboard and mouse or have a controller in your hand. Enemy Unknown packs dense amounts of dramatic tension into each turn. And so it's time to eliminate the alien threat, commander. Select a location, build your base…and save humanity.

Having played through XCOM:EU/EW and XCOM 2 multiple times, I still think XCOM:EW is the better game overall. Enemy Unknown, while still a great game, allowed for too much passiveness during combat. Enemy Within tries to add a level of urgency during battles so you can't just turtle. The reward for that urgency is the ability to modify your soldiers with incredible, game-changing upgrades: like giving your soldiers the ability to turn invisible at times or chopping off all their arms and legs to put them into a giant anime mec (cause why not?). XCOM 2, I feel, they went a bit overboard with the urgency mechanics. To the point where the game just felt stressful to play all the time. 

XCOM:EW strikes the almost perfect balance. It still allows for a bit too much passiveness which can make combat slow. The reverse difficulty curve is also something to know about going in: the early game is definitely more difficult than the late game by far, even on classic difficulty. There is also no procedural map generation like XCOM2, so you will see the same maps multiple times. 

Still, I've played through this game at least 5 times now on every difficulty up to classic and I still want to go back and play it again. So, it must be doing something right.",1466711494,1633955318,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Truth be told I had to start over and over again several times, untill I was able to find the strategy that suited me best.

There are moments when a 98% chance to hit the enemy is more like 40% chance and vice versa... Aside all the negative stuff you could attribute to the games AI or chance to hit engine, this is a real jewel of a game. This is a remake of the old XCOM for those who didn't know.

You get Four Classes from the base game, plus gene modifications and Cyber upgrades later on greatly improoving your tactical choises in the field. The gameplay works fine, there are very few bugs and overall it is a great investment. It is guaranteed that it will keep you busy for many days!

Graphics and sound are good, the story is preety basic, yet it makes you feel like your troops are real heroes and saviors of Earth.

My advice for new players? Buy full package for starters, once you begin the game play on classic difficulty 4 members only, it might seem hard at first but it is a cost effective gearwise plus you get to upgrade troops a lot faster since the kill rewards are concentrated on fewer members. Finally regardless of what you think, go all out for satellte coverage! Once 3/4 of the planets countries are under your protection you get tons of money for buying proper gear, aircrats, weapons etc. Infrastracture brings mid and late game benefits which outweight the early game hard difficulty... Also I used to play with a roullete where the skills of each soldier were randomized... Yeah it might seem cool, but using the vanila setting offer more specialized troopers who end up being a lot more efficient. Random stats are good, you need them to have as high as possible aim the rest are useless more or less.

[b]In Short:[/b] [i]This game marked the beginning of my exposure to strategy turn-based industry with tactical gameplay elements. Modern gaming industry owes an appreciation to this game specifically for popularizing this genre and bringing attention to it, which was how I learned about this awesome series. This game has aged when compared to its sequel, XCOM 2. If you are considering purchasing this game in 2021+ for the narrative before playing the sequel, I do not recommend spending your money. Purchase it only if you genuinely enjoy the genre of turn-based strategy, but do be warned this game can be harder and more punishing than XCOM 2. More challenging![/i]

The review is organized by categories with additional notes if I have something to add.

[b]Game's Visuals (Graphics)[/b]
[ ] Beautiful
[x] Good
[ ] Decent
[ ] Bad
[ ] Poor

Personal Note: I love cartoony style! I'm biased. That's all I have to say. To most, it may look decent, but it's definitely not bad. I find this artstyle pleasing to the eye without ruining the immersion, atmosphere or feeling of [i]realism[/i].

[b]Game's Sound Design[/b]
[ ] Beautiful
[ ] Good
[x] Decent
[ ] Bad
[ ] Poor

Personal Note: Solid sound design. Not a masterpiece, but it gets the job done. Weapons sound fitting, the alien sounds match, voice-actors are fair, and so on. Plus, this game provides voice-acting for soldiers on multiple languages, including Russian! [i]The language the second installment didn't include...[/i]

[b]Gameplay Mechanics[/b]
[ ] Beautiful
[x] Good
[ ] Decent
[ ] Bad
[ ] Poor

Personal Note: For its time, this was a [i]one-of-a-kind[/i] turn-based strategy. There were not many options on the market with similar gameplay to XCOM. Now, it's a different story. However, if you wish to experience one of the [i]Founding Fathers[/i] of the strategy turn-based games, you will definitely hear about XCOM!

[b]Story/Narrative[/b]
[x] Beautiful
[ ] Good
[ ] Decent
[ ] Bad
[ ] Poor

Personal Note: If [i]taking charge of an international organization, that is similar to the real life U.N., in response to an alien invasion in order to combat the foreign and unknown enemy as humanity unites in its darkest hour[/i] doesn't sound EPIC to you, I don't know what could impress you! Personally, I've really enjoyed the narrative and story. I felt engaged and curious about the intentions of the alien invasion. In some cases, it was even brutal. Again, it's not a masterpiece, but I really enjoyed the story this game told me as I, the player, progressed it forward.

[b]Replayability[/b]
[x]Yes!
[ ] Kinda
[ ] None

Personal Note: Definitely! The story never changes, it ultimately comes down to your victory or your defeat. However, the journey to the end of game in each campaign will be different. The nature of this game will never have the exactly same experience, with an exception of few scripted mission. There is no direct Steam Workshop for this game, but there is a well-known mod for this game known as ""Long War."" Recommended if you wish to change up the gameplay.

[b]Final Note:[/b]
One of the best strategy games out there, hands-down!

The story is intriguing and engaging. Strategy and tactical gameplay is the strongest appeal, though. I also enjoy any game that offers character customization, and here you can personalize each soldier under your command! However, be prepared to dedicate a long-term strategy and time since this game takes careful planning. Of course, you are at liberty to rush in and see what happens, but trust me: it's a very punishing strategy.

Don't be ashamed when your favorite soldier, [i]friend[/i] or [i]relative[/i] dies to a ridiculous chance and you are forced to reload a save file. We all know you will do it, we all know you did it, and we all know that we would do the same. ;)",1480192273,1632606785,True,0,1,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

A game that's been around for forever....but that's the thing, if a game's been around for years upon years, there's no reason for it to have as many bugs as it does.  The bugs range from long pauses during attacks on your troops, and on the enemy, to clear graphic corruption during maps.  I've had issues launching the game a few times.  Even when the game is running smoothly, you'll see that each map is kinda tedious - it takes 2-3 and even 4 turns to find enemies.  Your turn is always followed by an Alien turn, where you're forced to watch and hear off-screen aliens move about.....which is highly irrelevant if you're nowhere your Alien opponents.  Even when you're actively fighting the aliens, you can't skip/fast-forward through their turn.  Sometimes you'll be putting the finishing touches on one enemy (and you know it's the last enemy on the map)....and you'll still be forced to watch.  If you've played alot like me, you've seen this kind of scene 1000+ times, and you'd rather just skip it.  As you can see, I've played alot (109 hours).  Great game, but I can't say it's solid.  I'm not sure if there's ever been updates since launch, but I can say that I've never seen any update since I've owned this (2 years), and there's still loads of bugs.

This game has a great premise. Unique mechanics, cool environments. I spent hours and hours building my roster, customizing and upgrading the team, and using them to smash the enemy. It's really a fun game and worth playing, very satisfying despite the slower pace. It's a turn based squad tactics game.

It's extremely addictive, and a really unique version of the alien invasion theme. It deals with body horror, and evolution. Cool. If you can get past the huge learning curve, winning this game is extremely rewarding.

CONS:
It's frustrating; the physics and imbalance issues are at times too much to take. In the early game you can expect your soldiers to literally cry like babies when they're shot at, and kill each other in a panic. Also, guns are almost useless in higher difficulties; the soldiers miss almost always, and barely do any damage. You are at an unfair disadvantage early on, to the point where it IS comical, if not pathetic and infuriating.

I'd say buy it on sale. It's fun, but might test your patience too much if you plan to finish it.

Update: I tried this game again, and eventually beat it. VERY REWARDING. But the physics are still nonsense. I recommend it, mostly.",1613510189,1631825594,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Somehow they feel slow, and I just want to unwind without thinking about things too much. But Xcom managed to pull me right in. It succesfully mixes turn based strategy with a bit of management, and,... guess what ? It's great fun !

Xcom uses a certain graphical style, which reminded me a bit of Team Fortress 2. It's not super detailed by any means, but I still liked the clean look of things.

The combat is brilliant, with the camera zooming in when a certain action is taken. It makes the combat feel exciting. Completing missions and killing enemies will level up your soldiers. You'll learn to take care of them, because when they're a higher level some of their abilities might just save you and your squad.

The story is nothing special, but the way the whole game is executed is just amazing. You'll have to make some difficult choices (concerning building certain items/facilities and the missions you choose to accept), none of which are right or wrong.

The sounds and music also add to the atmosphere of the entire game.

Also, for a single-player game it's surprisingly lenghty as well. It should take most players well over 20 hours to complete, especially if you mess up your first few games (like me). 

Highly recommended !

3) The grappling hook is completely bugged and useless now. I can barely get my soldiers to use any tiles on a space ship.
4) It's a constant struggle to get my soldiers to run to the furthest yellow tile. The amount of times where the soldiers have just dashed to some random place that is miles from where I clicked is astonishing.

This game has an incredibly dedicated mod fanbase which helps keep it fresh and interesting (i.e. increasingly brutal). If you've never done a single hex edit in your life, the how-to guides make it totally doable for a dedicated neophyte.

The game play curve is severely front-loaded. Getting the hang of the early game can be frustrating but made me feel like Sun Tzu and Rain Man's biologically and temporally improbable offspring once I made it through a whole playthrough without losing a single country. Consequentially, a front-loaded game tends to have a bit of a boring or repetitive late game, and XCOM is no exception.

And considering that you can still miss point blank shots only to have the alien to smash your guy to pulp I'd say that this does have the feeling of the old game.

If you start having problems saving your game (probably about 10-15 hours into the game), just delete most of your previous saved games. You can delete them from within the game (no need to find folders and files).
If you can manage to have a max of around 10 saved games at any one time, saving shouldn't be a problem.
At least this worked for me.

TIP: If you buy this game in a bundle with the expansion DLC ""XCOM - Enemy Within"", just skip to the expansion immediately. You'll be playing the base game, just with more variety (more stuff to research, additional different maps, additional types of enemies etc.).

Oh, and the game is really good!
It's basically 50% a resource management game and 50% tactical combat. Both parts are well done.
Sure, the game doesn't have much depth and is pretty repetitive - but what it does, it does very well.

If you can live with some technical issues (crashes, problems with saved games) and you like turn-based tactical games, this might very well be up your alley.

Hmm, I beat XCOM EU when it released; however, I purchased Enemy Within and #whoa, mind blown.  They added a TON of content that it literally feels like a new game.  I'm happy I purchased it, but it tripled my play time (thanks devs).  

I'm a huge XCOM fan.  From customizing your troops, selecting which research you develop, or who carries what equipment, XCOM fulfills it all.  It's like a RP/strategy/SIMS game.  If you haven't played one, definitely grab XCOM: EW.  I can guarantee you'll love it (insert chris farley w/tommy boy guarantee clip).

Dislike: F***ing A, my game started to randomly crash so I had to constantly save... Really annoying.  Oh, and make sure you develop satellites quickly or you're going to have to restart.  I had to restart *thrice* and that sucked because I dropped like 6+ hours into a campaign I couldn't even finish...  I don't remember the original being so ""world saving"".

As MOST of the Time: when its an ALIEN'S Turn, and they have ""LINE OF SIGHT"" with one of your Troops,
They will Strategically Position them selves however the computer decides its going to, and then will Begin Firing at your Soldier, AND WILL CONTINUE TO FIRE Either until your Guy Is Shot And Killed, Or, you Hit the Reset Button becuase the Alien has been Shooting at you for Almost 30 minutes Now???
they NEVER run out of Ammo.
OR TIME UNITS...

In Enemy Unkown, This is NOT the Case Anymore.
how your Base is Built, or What you Research isnt anywhere near as important as it was in the other Titles.
in Enemy Unknown, its more important to KNOW your Soldiers Capabilities, what they ""Can"" and (PROBABLY) ""Will Fail"" at Doing, and Where They Should Be Positioned To Be The Most Use,
my First Play Through, i stuck to my Own Personal ""Thing"" and REFUSED to Use NON-Human Equipment.
And Was Still Blowing Them Away :)
which IS FREAKING AWSOME TO WATCH!!! ""if i must say"" :)
I ""LOVE"" The way the Aliens ""Die"" :) as Morib as that sounds... Lol...

Seeing comrades fall after missing multiple 95% shots in a row is a traumatising event which is always an iconic experience in Xcom and I had to deal with that many times in my 12 attempts at beating this bullsh*t run. Yet, seeing your valiant soldiers do the unthinkable and roll high damage shots or hit a <15% shot is such a magical moment that can never be forgotten. Alas, I finally defeated the alien menace after 635 days of non-stop pain and the shedding of much blood, sweat and tears - finally the Xcom Project with barely a few nations backing it after the second month had eliminated the Elders. This campaign, while probably giving me grey hairs from stress, was such a fun experience that I have nothing but fond memories of.

Many XCOM or UFO stamped games have since been released, but many have not proven to be better or similar to this mythical ancestor.

Then Fireaxys the studio of Sid ""Civilization"" Meier's it is leaning on a title which will be the worthy heir of UFO. The background is now commonplace (this was not the case with UFO at the time), an alien invasion that threatens humanity, a para-military organization funded by a small group made up of many countries around the world.

Two big changes are noted all the same, which seem abused on paper but ultimately not so useless given the hardcore difficulty of the title at its highest levels.

Firstly, the management of the xcom base, in UFO we could manage several tactical bases, there a single main base like HQ, that may not seem like much but it is largely sufficient, because over the course of the game several bases would be very difficult to manage. For the rest it is similar to the other xcom and ufo games, with military buildings and other scientific complexes, everything is there to counter this invasion.

Second point and not insignificant (at the beginning of course), the composition of the squads for ground operations. Fireaxys wanted to make the game more tactical than its predecessors with squads made up of 6 soldiers maximum as opposed to 24 on UFO. At first glance really too little but in the long term it is judicious, it allows to better prepare its strategies, 24 soldiers would be too heavy to manage.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown is epic, very cinematic and incredibly violent in terms of urban combat, it shoots at all costs for nervous and stressful gunfight, it panics, it dies and there are moments of bravery worthy of the greatest war movies, pure happiness. Served by many scenaristically successful cinematics but less design level (unlike the whole game).

There are side missions that are well entrenched in the original storyline, like the board missions, which gives the game a bit of a revival, and the recent enemy within DLC adds even more side missions and gameplay.

You want epic, listen to the soundtrack during the travel, preparation and mission phases, this is the orgy.

Count 30 hours of easy play but multiply that by 10 in impossible or marathon mode.

First, since I want to find the aliens as fast as possible, I fan out my units. This means that when I do find enemies most of the units are far away, and for the next few turns I spend half my commands telling them to move closer to the battle.

Second, It feels like it forces me to be less strategic, as my desire to keep troops in good cover conflicts with the incentive to find and kill the aliens as fast as possible. For example, I might either move my unit twice and uncover enemies, who will shoot that unit, and I cannot do anything to protect that unit since I have used all moves. On the other hand, If I keep my troops in cover, I move much slower, and find out 6 turns later that I could have just rushed it in 4 turns, and now won't finish the mission fast enough.

To avoid these problems I reload the save and move with the benefit of hindsight. Following this gameplay cycle felt boring and repetitive after a while. This really took out the tension and atmosphere of the fear of ambush, but not reloading saves meant I would never find and kill the aliens fast enough to salvage the bonus resources, and spend half my turn just telling my units to get closer to the fight. Essentially, the game incentivised me to more or less kill immersion, which is a real shame, cause the music and the sound effects really made me feel anxious for when I would encounter the aliens. To fix this I would make it so such that the aliens are alerted when you drop your troops in, if you don't find them they will find you, and once contact is made with aliens, they communicate to the other aliens to come and help them. This way I would spend a lot less time trying to find aliens and more time fighting aliens instead. It also would be entirely realistic. These guys figured out space travel but didn't figure out calling their army buddies for help when attacked? We use radio, surely they at very least use radio!

Moving on, the combat was also boring, again due to the fog of war. When the aliens are attacked they don't communicate to the other aliens in the building to help, so they mostly fight you in small groups at a time. This meant that much of combat was simply overwhelming the small group with my firepower.

Comparatively, enjoyed the combat in Great Little War Game far more, simply because there was much greater variety. You had to worry about certain armour being better penetrated by certain ammunition types, so you would want to ensure specific types of troops would want to fight specific other types of troops to maximise the matchup advantage, but there's no such concept in this game. There aren't enemies weaker to laser beams than bullets, or weaker to a melee weapon that a ranged weapon, so when I encounter small groups I only need to consider which enemies are in whose range. I don't have to consider shooting this type of alien with a laser instead of bullets, this type of alien with a grenade instead of lasers, this type of alien with a melee weapon rather that ranged weapons.

Now when I encounter large groups of enemies I do have to be strategic, and then the game becomes much more fun, but overall the amount of time I spend being strategic in a combat mission was small enough that I got bored and stopped playing. This is not the case in Great Little War Game, where I have to be strategic even when wiping out a small group when I have superior firepower, so I feel like the game would have been far more enjoyable if they had added something like this.

Other than field operations being somewhat boring due to how little time I spend on strategic thinking compared to just moving units around and autopilot combat, the rest of the game is great. Building a base, maintaining finances, strategically equipping gadgets and weapons, choosing research priorities, I did find these very fun. But at the end of the day all these activities are meant to enhance your ability to fight aliens, and for most part I don't find alien fighting fun.

Now perhaps you might enjoy the combat in spite of what I wrote, and also enjoy the rest of the gameplay, then you'll probably enjoy this. Given how acclaimed this game is it probably isn't a bad game, but it's not something I'm enjoying much sadly. And I went in really hoping and expecting I would enjoy this, since I loved Great Little War Game, another turn based strategy shooter. Truth be told if not for all the great praise this game had received I would have quit far sooner. That I got bored of it is a real shame.

The graphics are also better than I expected and the action is almost cinematic when your characters move, so it was more visually exciting than your average Fire Emblem game. [/strike]

EDIT: I have currently gone through several missions (I mean, two, but I keep reloading saves because of stupid rng so I feel like it's been ages) where my soldiers overwhelmingly miss shots of 70+% probability and shots at point blank range. Meanwhile, the aliens can shoot my guys from across the level. I've also encountered a game breaking bug in one, particular map where an alien gets caught on a ledge and the whole game freezes...and how long has this game been out? Still a fun game, for the first few hours. Absolute bullcrap after that, it seems ):< Note: I'm only playing on Normal. Maybe there's a bug? But The difficulty level seems to jump twice when you get to a certain point in this game. Same thing happened to my playthrough back in 2015. I abandoned it thinking maybe I was just being stupid in my youth. Nope. Still suddenly ridiculous

For example, I was absolutely sure I was cornering the last enemy alien on the map and many of my men were injured because the aliens kept landing shots and my guys couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. I just needed to kill this last alien and my guys could go to the hospital. I ran one of my assault guys, the guy with the shotgun, up to two spaces away from the alien and fired. Miss. I had my guys what were 5 spaces or more away from the alien. All misses, except for one hit that only damaged the alien. The alien killed one of my guys. In my next turn it took all of the combined forces of my squad to shoot that one stupid alien. How does that make sense? These creatures are here to be dickheads and my guys are fighting for survival. What, are they all blinded by tears? I wouldn't be crying if the survival of my race depended on this!

I can only hope that if an alien conglomerate tries to invade Earth in the future it'll be more Halo than Xcom. For the love of--!",1487154440,1626830440,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What really made me enjoy the game was naming my soldiers after myself and my friends :) Very fun informing my friends if they sucked or not as soldiers and telling em shit like ""holy fuck Rudis hit a 20% shot to save Jessie"". I didn't enable Ironman mode but I basically played it that way, only 1 save and if someone died, they died.

I finally completed the game after 170+ hours.  This was on normal difficulty.  The game's difficulty curve is quite erratic, and sometimes unfair things happen just randomly.  But the rule seems to be, in almost every area that is not time constrained (95% of the time this is the case), then the slower you go the better.  Make sure there is cover and use overwatch mode frequently.  I finally didn't mind zombies so much - but the first time I saw them they were a bit too cliché.  Not everything in the technology tree is important, and some items are must-have, and once this all makes sense, the game goes fairly smoothly.  The first hour or so of a game seems to be the hardest part, and it seems worth letting countries leave to avoid losing troops early on.


UPDATE:
I forgot all about the zombies.  There's something about zombies in a science fiction game that just breaks my immersion.  It's like the game stops taking itself seriously at that point.


ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I played this heavily when I first got it.  It does get a little repetitive even though it unfolds new content excellently.

The learning curve can take a long time, which was why I put the game down after hitting yet another level that felt like a wall.  [That's just my personality - if I notice I'm going to lose a bunch of units in a hopeless battle, I don't want to play much more.]  But the fault was that I hadn't understood what research needed to be done early and how to balance the economy - learning how to do this can take some time and it's less intuitive than many other games, because income doesn't flow in as much as every month there is a larger payoff.

Tactics is excellent in this game - well just watch some youtube videos and you'll have an idea if that is your cup of tea.

There is a linearity to the game in contrast other Sid Meier's titles - a story is unfolding as you play, and there's not very much parallelism other than unit levelling.

All the tactical maps are pre-written, so once you understand the layout, it gets just slightly redundant - but it's not bad.

The technology tree is quite blind - all you know is the duration of what you're about to research, but no details about how that new thing will compare to what you're currently using.

As a personal preference this game is not my favorite, but it's good enough to come back to and get right back in and try out some new ideas.

Will I buy XCOM2?  Almost certainly.  I might wait for a sale price, but XCOM: Enemy Unknown has sold me on the franchise.",1442103465,1626548872,True,0,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Like many games in the genre, the types of missions you go on is limited, so it can get repetitive at time. However, as the game progresses, new enemies are introduced and upgrades become available, which keeps it interesting enough to enjoy. The expansion, XCOM Enemy Within, adds extra upgrades and gameplay mechanics to increase replayability. So if you are considering buying this game, search for a bundle deal that includes both.... The package deal was only $2 more during the Steam summer sale.

I have 2 minor issues with this game. 
1) A couple minutes after I launch the game, the game minimizes and I see my Windows desktop. The game is still running, and i just have to click the icon in the taskbar to return.  It only does it once per launch and never causes actual problems.... so it is a minor annoyance.

2) I get the impression that it was developed for consoles with mouse-support added in. In the Console version, you use the controller's sticks pan around the map or to aim certain weapons that affect large areas (like grenades). That works well. However, the PC version uses the mouse for both of these things. If the mouse gets into a region close to the edge of the screen, the map starts to pan to that side.....but that can cause problems when aiming grenades or rockets at things in those regions of the screen. Also, game occasionally seemed to have problems mapping the x,y coordinates of the mouse to the x,y,z coordinates in the games. These thing rarely  cause actual problems in gameplay, but it can happen and it is annoying in those few times. I haven't tried playing it with a controller on the PC yet.... maybe that would eliminate these issues.",1625554115,1625554115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But its got some SERIOUS flaws that keep me from giving it a perfect score.

Overall, its a solid game. A simple turn based squad tactics game.
Most of its flaws seem to originate from the utterly stupid idea that console players would be interested in a hardcore tactical strategy game. And the even stupider notion, that the game's controls and design need to be crippled to support playing with a gamepad over KBM.

Lets get the nice out of the way, the tactics are good. Balance is nice. Being able to design my own troops and customising their load outs with bad ass alien kit is just awesome. I really can't stress just how well this game nails combat, its fun and balanced such that if you actually have a brain pulling off flawless missions is entirely a test of your abilities. 
Yes RNG is a component, but unlike other games I could *Mordheim* I mean mention. The deck never feels stacked against you. Yes their are objective missions, but they don't just throw infinite hordes at you. And never once in all my hours of XCOM did I get hit with a -200% hit chance debuff. 

You also have to build and design the XCOM HQ. Which honestly, feels a bit Fallout Shelter. Not just in appearance but also design. Almost nothing is done instantly, its all done on an in-game timer. Which feels VERY Fallout Shelter. 
The difference is Fallout Shelter makes you wait just to torture you. At least here in XCOM the waiting is balanced such to make you think through all your building decisions and try to lay things out nice and neatly. Sadly since optimisation is key you can't really build your base however you want. Eventually you're going to gravitate towards efficiency and since the only way to pass time is to stare at a big hologram of Earth you can't even enjoy it like an ant-farm, watching your little minions run around your base. Doing tasks here and there. Not that I think they even animated much to look at anyway.

The music is also solid, it really puts me in the right mindset of being stressed but not overwhelmed, it's not something I can listen to outside the game. But it does a good job getting and keeping the player engaged.

Visually the game is a mixed bag. The enemy aliens are very distinct and each design carries a great a mount of visual information. You look at a Muton and you know it's going to wreck havock. Then the support characters chime in and give you the inevitable baby's first explanation of what a big scary monster is and does. While the armour and vehicle designs look cool, the guns look like something out of a bad anime. I swear the starting rifle is 4 feet long but the average weapon is bigger than the torso of the guy/girl using it.

So the bad?

Well, I have a lot of nit picks that don't mean much. 
But where else can I talk about them? 
I wish Central would stop babying me with tutorials. 
I wish Raymond and Valhen would shut up and stop telling me how to think and feel about things. 
The graphics aren't ugly, but the weapon designs are straight from a cartoon world. (seriously, every gun must be 5-6 feet long.) 
Being able to customise your soldiers is nice but whats the point of having them be from different countries if they all speak perfect English with heavy American accents? (Unless you buy the Enemy Within expansion)

But then there is the real issues.
The game is still incredibly buggy. 
On most missions the camera is a bigger threat than the enemy. Its in this weird-semi fixed state that was clearly designed around a controller. So you can't freely rotate it. Only move by quarters and pan across the map. Your zoom is also fixed by only letting you control what floor/layer of the map your looking at. Being fixed like that makes it very hard to get an idea of the battle field at any kind of speed. And often leads to having to click at odd angles that make it very difficult to tell exactly what a new position for your units will entail. 

Since the camera is always shifting around to show case animations, the game never knows where to render icons like status effects or damage numbers. So often those things get layered on top of each other and then you can't read them.
Both player units and enemy animations will often just fail completely, causing them to fire bullets in every direction. Side ways, angular, even completely backwards. 
Hits often don't render properly and bullets will take bazzar paths vaguely in the direction of the target but get stopped by a wall or something. 

Also nothing is displayed by numbers, units don't have an HP number. They have a little pile of blocks which are very tiny and hard to count in the heat of things. I don't want to have to count how many blocks my guy has and figure out if a grenade will kill him or not. Just tell me a number and I can compare that in my head much faster.



I admit these sound like minor faults but they all add up to make the game very unreadable at times. 
When one of my units dies, I prefer it to be because I made a bad move. Not cause the camera snapped in some unpredictable way that caused me to miss-input and move my unit out onto uncovered ground.

The game also completely lacks any sort of comprehensive inventory. 
Sure you can go to the foundry and look at how many you have built/purchased over your campaign. But it doesn't tell you if those items are in use or who by or anything like that. 

Lastly abilities and upgrading your soldiers.
Every time a soldier gains a rank, you can choose between two abilities.
These are in my opinion, utterly false choices, as often its a choice between either a highly situational ability that might maybe benefit you on a percent chance. Or a guaranteed upgrade that confers increased stats or a massive boost to damage.
(Seriously, combine Rapid Fire and Close Combat Specialist on an Assault and they can fire 3 15 damage shots in one turn. Or put heat rounds on your Heavy Weapons Guys and watch them one shot almost every mechanical enemy in the game.)

Honestly, in the end.
I'm really not sure how I feel about XCOM.

I enjoy the combat, and the base building. 
But I hate the waiting for new missions to appear.

I love customising my units.
But I hate that a Irish alien hunter will speak like a Californian and yell ""OORAH"" like a cliche US Marine.

Getting a soldier to max rank feels rewarding as hell.
But the perks are so poorly balanced that every single one plays exactly the same.

I think your millage with XCOM is entirely dependant on how hardcore of a strategy gamer you are. Its probably best for people who enjoy Starcraft, or like me just suck at anything more complex.
Buy it on sale, don't bother playing Enemy Unknown. Stick to the much better Enemy Within expansion since that's where the REAL customisation and unit verity lies.",1455517740,1624148254,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even changing the options is something you have to fight the game for. In any menu, if you happen to use the scroll wheel, it triggers the test voice for the voice option, even if you're in another screen. The keybindings menu bugs to high heavens, change any key and you're back at the top of the list (the whole list is about 4 or 5 pages long). If there is a conflict, it won't offer to switch keys, just delete the conflicting one, so you have to scroll all the way back down again. When not playing on a QWERTY keyboard, that's lots of wasted time. 

Then, once in the game proper, couldn't rotate the camera even though the bindings had been done, except that one time when the game's tutorial specifically asked me to. Never before, never again. When you try customizing a soldier and change their ethnicity, other options change randomly, the most annoying being the helmet that often pops out of the blue, which basically gets in the way of effectiveley customising your soldier. Can't launch a grenade at the enemy, game won't let me, but won't let me cancel launching the grenade either, effectively locking the mission. Had to use task manager to kill it because nothing else would work.

Basically, everything that should be fun is made a chore by an extremely bad interface and bugs. After 70-ish minutes, I couldn't even finish the first mission, I barely could start it, actually.

Wish there were better soldier customization.  Like you can have all the colors of the rainbow to paint your armor, but how about some practical war type cosmetics.  Like I'd rather put my soldiers in camouflage armor than have them fall from the sky like a handful of skittles for the aliens to eat up.  Also I could have sworn you could change your soldiers nationality and gender, so you can create a more diverse army, or like me create real life friends as characters. LOL.  Sadly however, there is no such options.  I'm glad they allowed you to in XCOM 2 at least.

A lot of stuff doesn't make sense, like you're the last line of defense, but you have to scrape and claw to get table scrap funding from the countries who invested in this project.  They each want you to cater to their needs, but guess what??? You ain't got the $$$ early to mid game so they start losing hope in you.  Well fork over the dough you stingy, whiney, biznatches!!!

Also some game mechanics (I'm sure if you searched the internet you'll know) are outrageously FUBAR in this game.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME if you are prone to anger outburst and/or have a beautiful head of hair on your head.  YOU WILL want to pull your f---ing hair out with this game.  Whoever programmed the hit chances in this game is either the most ingenious troll or the f---ing worst programmer in the entire world.  Not sure which yet.  YOU WILL constantly miss 80% hit chance shots and up.  I have consistently missed 95% - 97% hit chances as much as made them.  The numbers you see as your hit chance on screen are visual lies, an the program uses a hidden code for ""actual"" hit chance.  It ties in to how well you're doing in the mission and if your soldiers have been taking damage like good little men and women are supposed to.  Too many healthy soldiers means ""Oops!  You just missed a 95% hit shot, but next round your enemy didn't.  Now your poor soldier is injured and out for days or DEAD!!!""  LOL.

You'll constantly have enemies drop from the f---ing sky, just so they can be conveniently behind you.  LIKE IT'S CHALLENGING RIGHT??? YOU DIDN'T EXPECT SPAWNS FROM NOWHERE RIGHT??? IT'S CHALLENGING???

Ok explanation in game ""They were dropped off by the mothership.""  OK. OK. That makes a little sense.  Later on in game you're on a f---ing mothership and enemies still drop from the sky to conveniently surround you.  LIKE WHO THE F--- DROPPED THESE MFers OFF??? THE FATHERSHIP???  LOL!!!

-Got XCOM as a gift from a friend who thought i'd like it - turns out I did
-I have played this for over 825H and will likely continue to come back to it periodically.
-If you enjoy a wargames experiences, this is hard to beat 
-Don't let difficulty deter you, that's why there are difficulty settings
-11/10, S-CLASS, just go get it 

XCOM is divided seamlessly into what I would see as essentially 2 games - The tactical battles your soldiers fight out in the field at you command, paired with the strategic management of XCOM from HW/overworld. 

One of the reasons I love this game is because it creates its own narrative naturally depending on how your experience goes. here is an example:
Were you surprised by a new enemy - on a day when your best soldiers were recovering in the hospital? 
That opens the door for a narrative where the rookies banded together to survive and triumph, or they failed terribly, leaving a lone survivor hardened enough to join the other vets? And what were the longer term consequences of that loss/win?

There are a number of features about the original XCOM: Enemy Unknown (and the expansion, Enemy Within) that I consider unfair and even broken. Sometimes my troops miss shots with 90%-chances, or activate two alien nests in one move, or one bad enemy round costs the life of my only leveled medic on the team. There's an odd duality to XCOM where it is the title I'm both most likely to rage quit after a run of bad luck and also the title that I'll rebound back to afterwards - it is both enthralling and infuriating at once.

The plot is described in many places, but I'll cover it briefly by describing your character as the Commander of an elite force that protects the Earth from an ongoing alien invasion. If that sounds to you like a trope that's been done before in movies and games that's because it has, and the game itself is not shy about offering even more B-movie cliches to this already familiar premise. The alien physical forms resemble the typical ""grey"" aliens from abductee descriptions, they pilot actual UFO saucers, and they abduct persons to experiment upon. The XCOM project is also led by a council of World Nations represented by a certain Illusive Man (?) who has humanity's best interests at heart (Mass Effect 2, anyone?)

To be clear, I am not making any complaint about the title lacking originality and, even if I were, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a remake of the original Microprose title so the design team can only exercise so much creative flexibility compared to the original material. XCOM is an interpretation of a modern-day UFO invasion with the alien models, objectives and ethos taken right out of 1950's cinema (or even H.G. Wells literature from the 19th-century.) The player should not expect the soaring philosophical inquiry and introspection that usually comes from contemporary titles where 'Man's Place In The Universe' is an open question - your job is to go kill aliens, Commander. The objective is survival and peace was never an option.

In addition to the several deployable soldiers supporting you in this task, the XCOM project also includes a German scientist and Japanese engineer (?) who provide the upgraded equipment and facilities that will be needed as the game difficulty inevitably ramps up over time. The raw material required for this is taken from both successful missions and currency paid by protecting countries from rising panic levels, both of which you can only indirectly control. For nearly all decisions that occur during the base-building half of the game, the Commander will need to economize decisions to get the most value out of finite money and inventory.

This is an important point about the intersection of the 'Gameplay' vs. the 'Plot'. Given a choice between the two, XCOM chooses 'Gameplay' absolutely every single time. That's the right choice I think but it leads to peculiar outcomes if you are playing for immersion. My logical brain tells me that if the combined forces of the World were truly invested in their own survival, they would fund XCOM with infinite support and an army of Heavy Infantry. Instead, the XCOM project is operated on a shoestring budget that is 'earned' by protecting wealthier countries (sorry, Egypt) and selling looted alien tech onto a Grey Market of interested buyers. While creating a great sense of strategic depth, it's hard to explain how you failed to save the planet because XCOM couldn't afford to build a sub-basement and went over it's budget buying soldiers (and who is profiting from XCOM 'buying' soldiers?)

But the turn-based battlefield is XCOM's bread-and-butter. This is where the men are separated from boys and heroes are molded. The strategy and complexity are the single best feature of the whole game and both the level design and tactics required to win are Dead Solid Perfect. As Commander, you can perfectly feel both the benefits of upgrading soldiers and the threat of new and dangerous alien forces. Sometimes there will be only open ground between Point A and Point B and only a swift dash will protect your character. Other times, the cover is only partial or at odd angles that hardly protect the soldiers at all (especially on alien ships) and soldiers will need to advance forward heedless of their own safety. It's all very stimulating and both a game of strategy and chance.

While I approve of most the battlefield mechanics, it also drives me absolutely nuts sometimes how desperate things can sometimes feel even with good strategy, and how far you can fall when you hit a run of bad luck. There is a strict cap of 6 soldiers (after Officer upgrades) in any engagement no matter how difficult or how many enemies (sometimes 20 or more) can be deployed. Every (presumably Elite) soldier to join XCOM starts as a Rookie with no abilities and no specialty - these are earned only through combat and specialties are assigned randomly so your team (like mine) could have up to 1/3 Snipers and only 1 or 2 Supports. The experience costs to obtain good soldiers are obtained over many missions but it takes only a single mission for an irreplaceable soldier to be lost from enemy fire. A single moment like this could cost a multi-hour playthrough as it becomes harder to persevere without specialist troops against alien elites.

Other complaints include soldiers who jeopardize a mission by missing near-perfect shots, characters who can shoot through walls with relatively high accuracy, and closely placed alien nests that can activate high numbers of nearby enemies. For an example of the last, Mutons and Chrysalids in later levels can be activated by moving into their observation zone, but they immediately approach the player and can even surround an XCOM soldier immediately after being visible. This is when you know that you are going to lose your scout today. Sometimes the game seems badly balanced and, if you are playing on Ironman mode, there is no going back to an earlier save - you own every bad decision even if they happened by chance.

When XCOM works, it is a beautiful work of art and absolutely perfect in it's design and execution. I've spent hours and will probably spend more (then quit in frustration and start over) defending against the growing threat of the aliens. I wish there wasn't such awful finality when a misplaced step can fail a mission, cost lives and imperil the whole campaign. But the game is worth the investment of time for those moments when you are successfully pushing back the alien threat, feeling like the Avatar of Humanity defending the human race against the approaching apocalypse.",1623631264,1623631363,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The 'product' feels like a demo of a game. Almost every single part of the game felt undone or limited and left me dissatisfied.
Battle is kinda pleasant if you ignore clumsy soldiers who are supposed to be the world's elite.
Simple move/action system feels good but together with pleasant graphics it's unfortunately all good I have to say about the game.
Customisation of soldiers is limited. You can not pick soldier's class, gender nor nationality. That hurts. Class is chosen randomly after leveling up and this hurts in tactical game.
Elite soldiers are missing enemies standing next to them, shooting ceiling instead.
The only non-limited thing in the game is ammunition. Except for reloading you don't have to worry, just shoot.
Altogether everything hurts the immersion too much to treat the game seriously.
You can give it a try at 90% sale, but instead of feeding another studio go grab some indie game and leave the money to someone who make games, not business models.

1- You will spend less time playing than watching slow animations over which you have no control in the settings nor can you stop/skip them.

2- Similar to 1, it is very annoying not to be able to get the menu at any time, including for example if you misclicked and triggered animations and/or the whole enemy turn to end and now you have to wait forever before you can hit escape (and let us not talk about menu access during the tutorial when you may only hit Alt + F4 if you want to stop anything )

3- The probabilities of hitting/missing are totally randomized. I am not sure how they coded and how they seed but it feels stupid and gives you a bad experience at times. In any case I don't like the idea of having random stuff all over the place, better give damage adjustments based on offense/defense/cover...

4- When there is an enemy next to a wall, but you and the enemy are on the same side, basically the wall is not covering him from you, don't celebrate that you flanked him. The game tells you he is in High Cover because reasons. In contrast, I never felt it worked the same way for my troops.

5- If you get spot by the enemy (or you step on some trigger) they get to play twice once during your turn and another during their turn, which is stupid. This gives you incentives to reload and move less (even if one square less) just for the sake of playing around that dumb design. In contrast the game becomes stupidly easy when you realize that enemies don't really push toward you if you don't rush them, allowing you to exploit the design (groups of enemies have separate triggers of when it is time to attack)

6- Very early into the game you will realize the best thing is to rush getting more satellites (and normally you will screw up because you don't in advance that it takes forever to build them and that you won't be able to enjoy early research while still keeping all countries financing you). I think it is not necessary at all to save all countries but I don't enjoy losing stuff while playing optimally  it gives the feeling that I lost, and is not satisfying, that is why I restarted after a few missions once I understood that they also implemented some bullshit randomness. For example you see a country say UK at a panic level 3 ( a fresh 3) and Russia at 4 and has been at 4 for long, you might think Russia is more urgent, you play a mission that affects neither but guess what after you finish all of the sudden the 3 becomes 5 then they stop giving  you any mission that could help reduce it and you will probably not be able to send a satellite in time. So you better delay research and rush engineers and satellites for the sake of saving countries meaning making yourself play with weaker weapons and have less fun.

7- Lack of an important Quality of life Feature such as showing line of sight in a clear way.

8- For no reason, you may not pick all 5 continents then you google to find out that you are supposed to start a new game and that you have to disable the tutorial otherwise you will get screwed again and won't be able to pick (really? why can't choose any continent in the first playthrough?)",1623342752,1623344130,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[olist]
[*]In the beginning there is only one strategy that works and it's painfully tedious. See [b][u]Details[/u][/b] below.

[/olist]

[b][u]Details[/u][/b]
In the beginning game there is only one strategy that works because the way the game mechanics work and because the maps are way too small. When you start a new map you must move three soldiers to immediate cover and place them in overwatch. Then move your last soldier to cover which reveals a little of the map.

If you encounter any aliens they will react by moving to cover, which will trigger your first three soldiers in overwatch to take reaction shots. [u]This is the only time the aliens are vulnerable to your soldiers fire[/u]. Once they get to cover ([u]even half cover[/u]) your newbie soldiers will never hit them and the aliens will tear your squad apart [b]([u]even if your squad is in full cover[/u])[/b].

If you don't encounter any aliens then you repeat the process (move 3 to cover and overwatch then move the last to cover that reveals a bit more of the map). 

If this sounds painfully tedious, YOU ARE RIGHT, IT IS... But that is the only strategy that works. I have tried everything and nothing works.

Once your soldiers find the first aliens:
[list]
[*]If you try to rush the aliens you run into 1 to 3 more groups immediately behind them, because the maps are way too small. The battle just went from [u]4 vs 3[/u] to [u]4 vs 6[/u], [u]4 vs 9[/u] or [u]4 vs 12[/u]. All your soldiers die.
[*]If you try to flank the aliens the same thing happens. Your soldiers run into 1 to 3 more groups, it's now 4 vs 12 and your soldiers all die.
[*]If you retreat to full cover and put your soldiers in overwatch to shoot when the aliens advance, the aliens will just pick your squad off from long range [b][u]EVEN IN FULL COVER[/u][/b]. All your soldiers die.
[/list]

Once you get to the mid game you have a couple more options tactically. Some of your soldiers can choose abilities to destroy cover to expose aliens. Some of your soldiers can choose the suppression ability to pin down (neutralize) the most dangerous aliens giving you trouble.

However all tactics become moot mid game once you unlock psychic powers and the difficulty becomes a joke. Just mind control the strongest alien and use it to decimate the rest. Then the challenge becomes a joke and there is nothing left driving the game. Just keep doing the same missions, grooming your stable of soldiers until you decide to take the final mission. The final mission was a huge let down BTW. It's just a long hallway of chambers and each chamber has a progressively ""challenging"" group of aliens.

The game is not terrible, it's moderately enjoyable on normal difficulty, but normal difficulty should actually say VERY EASY. And Hard difficulty should actually say UN-ENJOYABLE PAIN IN THE ASS.

The only original aspect to the game is freaking your soldiers by splicing them with alien genes or cyborg-ing them into robo abominations. But it doesn't make up for the fatal flaws, which again are severely limited tactical options and ridiculously tiny maps.",1493146739,1623313300,False,0,0,0.439024388790130615,0,True,False,False

+ The graphics are also still pretty good for 2021. 

- Ultrawide support is a bit problematic, though. The mouse cursor is pretty off. It will sometimes make you misclick, which can lead to wrong moves or attacks. 
- There are also a couple of rare bugs in the game (CTDs in a specific mission and I had one freeze during ""alien activity"").

However, there are some elements you have no control over and I can't accept: 
1) You only get one squad of up to 6 soldiers at a time, which means you can't tend to multiple countries being abducted at once.
2) Skirmishes are VERY dependent on RNG. Percentages of hitting might as well be rolling D20s. I've had encounters where multiple 65%+ chances miss and one 25% chance passes on the same enemy.
3) When your squad lands in an area, you don't see where the enemies are. If you send one soldier ahead to scout the area and you happen to get surrounded by 6+ enemies, there is nothing you can do about it.

Unfortunately, the challenge becomes too much easier as new technologies and weapons are discovered. The worst thing compared to the original is that XCOM lacks strategical depth (the geoscape is almost non existant and base building is poor) and everything is too railroaded, the aliens don't have an agenda and simply periodically send cannon fodder. All while you for some reason can only have one Skyranger and one base, which I understand is a design choice to bring in a specific type of challenge, but I would have preferred something akin to the classic game (or to Xenonauts).

Enemy Unknown feels fair and balanced, and the research element of it (Discover alien tech, research new guns, use guns on aliens) is something that adds a lot of depth and fun. This is an old game but its a very good game and I recommend it.

- One of the first terms is that real agreement is on take2 website (link in the agreement), and by playing game you automatically agree to it.
- Last revision for the agreement Steam displays is January 22, 2018.
- Last revision date for the agreement on website is HIDDEN but switching to any language other than English would reveal it is July 13, 2019 and there are some key differences, including the fact that you cannot sue company in court, only through individual binding arbitration.
- Once again, by hitting ""I agree"" and running game you agree to whatever is written on website, even though it is different from the text shown to you. I don't think there is any way to revoke your consent, so once you  hit ""I agree"" you are on hook.

So knowing that there were several titles that following the original game, I was surprised to find out that this was a reboot of the original. (I did not follow the entirety of the original)  I ended up liking it since it was updated and better graphics. But instantly I knew it was programed specifically more for consoles due to its style of playing. (but these days, the money makers are in console games not PC's)

The original was more PC based with many screens for management (I would say keyboard and mouse, but on my PC it was  MSDOS under Windows 95 and that was all keyboard only).  If I remember correctly, the original was much more harder to play. I remember many hours of play on the original and having to restart to relearn everything just to get to a certain point. Sometimes to the point of actually getting pissed and slamming the keyboard. 

After playing this version, I found it a little easier. Maybe cause Ive played the orignial and expected most of the circumstances OR, maybe the game was tailored to be a bit easier for console players. Im not sure, maybe Im getting too old and its just an old mans ranting of ""Back in my day...""

Still though, I found it hard in the begining since alot of my troops kept dying, but later in the game after you research and build your troops get better tech and start dying less.

Beat the game in about 60 hours compared to the original game which took years of replaying to get somewhere.

All in all, a very good reboot of the original and worth playing.",1620721967,1620799223,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Play Enemy Unknown on Normal: Save and load often, get the hang of things.
2 Play Enemy Within (great DLC!) on Normal Ironman (autosave only): Get that adrenaline kick, learn caution, screwing a mission up badly, watching your best soldier die and moving on.
3) Ultimately it will probably feel too easy, so think you're great at it and move to Classic Ironman.

The graphics, yet old at the time of review, are neat and crisp, with nice effects from explosions and gunfire. The sound effects are great and best played with headphones for some of the music if you would rather have a sleepless night thinking the aliens are outside your window. Some of the map music sticks in your head in fact after you've done playing, it's one of those. The only complaint I have is that regardless of camera angle changing, it doesn't easily let you click some of the movement tiles, and can sometimes make you miss-click when attempting it. That can be really irritating if you're in a tight spot like a flanking enemy. You can sort of avoid this by playing with the Xbox controller instead, which although it integrates nicely with the game, who wants to play an isometric view strategy game without a mouse?!

After looking for some fun and cosmeticly appealing real-time management games, I happened to stumble across the XCOM series, and specifically: Enemy Unknown.

The game offers brilliant strategic gameplay, that emphasizes trial and error, and luck. Shots you take will be thrown into a probability calculator to determine how likely your shot will hit, and how much damage it will actually do. This mechanism is not only an incredibly fun way to play, but can as well become incredibly frustrating on some missions.

If you've played this game, you cannot tell me truthfully that you haven't reloaded a save file in the middle of a mission after 4 of your soldiers missed 90% shots and all ended up critically injured or dead.

The game has a fun gameplay system that mirrors a real life game of chess, which offers a fresh take on the strategy genre of games.

It expands on the lore of the original. I do still recommend playing the original DOS XCOM and also this one - you'll see there is fun to be had in both and both are equally challenging in different ways. If you play close attention you'll notice the devs have probably read the notes of Bob Lazar about area 51 , and some of the Dulce alien base conspiracy theories. I didn't really like at first how the newer generation XCOM deviated so much from the original appearance of the ""Sectoids,"" which originally are based off the ""Zeta Reticulans"" or ""Greys"" that so many people report in UFO sightings on MUFON and search but I'm able to forgive it, it's all artistic interpretation. I have the highest respect for the amount of effort that went into the design concepts and art, and I think it really gives a lot of insight to how humanity would actually respond to a hostile extraterrestrial invasion. The difficulty can be ramped up to make you pull your hair out or to be fair and comfortable - so it has something for everyone. I'll most definitely be buying XCOM 2 next.  I also highly recommend getting Enemy Within expansion DLC because it adds so many more maps and quality features to the experience.

Whenever I decide to play a turn-based strategy game, I always put XCOM as the first on my most enjoyable experiences.

I've spent so much time in this game that I don't regret it. I also got the Log War, but after 100 hours in the game, I decided to put it aside and jump on XCOM 2 to experience the amazing upgrade, graphics, and story.

➕Pros:
+ Amazing story
+ If you like Turn-Base Tactical Strategy games, you'll love this
+ Gameplay - you have so many units, and it's just an overall fun experience
+ If you want to enrich your game experience, you can mod the game
+ Have not enough of XCOM - well, you've got Long War Mod

➖Cons:
- Unites may feel a bit weird, and there's not much customization
- Long War Mod can feel too long

⭕Conclusion:
XCOM delivers an amazing job, and as a fan of the franchise, I looked forward to replying this game probably over 10x times by now. If you finished the game and felt that the Gameplay was too short, give the Long War Mod a try. It may be long, but you can tweak it.

The game is interesting, but get ready for a buggy ride!

- doors that cannot be opened
- unselectable units
- random crashes
- units that stay wounded forever
- buggy menus that will force you to close the game

Otherwise the game is OK.

The tactical side is interesting, but the game doesn't explain well the cover system. Sometimes you'll move your unit thinking that they'll be able to fire, only to find out that you wasted an action for nothing.

Glancing at the units you cannot really know their current state (is that enemy on overwatch?).

You also need to manage your base, build facilities, launch surveillance satellites and intercept UFOs. It adds a bit of management tasks to the game but they're not very complex.

The first missions are really difficult but afterwards the game gets progressively easier.

The music is ok and fits the mood but gets a bit repetitive, there's not a lot of variety.

MY FINAL ADVICE: SAVE YOUR GAME BEFORE AND AFTER EACH MISSION.",1617054047,1617105821,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is a bit easier, but definitely worth playing and after some practice You can beat the aliens. What I would recommend is to take the time while playing this game, as many small encounters seem to omit You while You are speed up.  And then You land unprepared for the the more tough battles.

I have more than enough time in this game to prove this ain't just raging cause I wiped in my first couple missions cause I suck. Here's the thing, even with all this time and beating the game 5+ times, I have never played a game above classic difficulty or on ironman mode. This is because the game at that point becomes entirely luck and doesn't work.So what you end up with is the game is either WAY to easy or you end up having an entire party wipe beacuse an enemy cyberdisk (high dps enemy) phases out of existance and can shoot at your people no matter where they are, but there is no unit there, but you can't end win because the game thinks there's an enemy left. I've seen 100% chance to hit miss, same with 100% crit. I've seen it where I clicked for a unit to go to one tile, then they went to some random ass one a mile away. I've seen overwatchs and CCS (triggers a reaction when an enemy moves within range) just not trigger so you end up getting destroyed by the person charging at you who your units just decided not to shoot even when they should. Not to mention, on top of all this the LOS system is complete shit, sometimes in your favor, sometimes not. So all I can say is expect to have no challenge because you have to play on an easier difficulty to make up for random BS getting you killed, or play the game on a higher difficulty where no amount of strategy can savev you from the some divine being deciding it doesn't like you and making you lose via a bug or a unit doing exactly the opposite of what you tell it.",1616850491,1616850491,False,1,0,0.493921935558319092,0,True,False,False

This is a tactical turn-based strategy game that is very difficult, but very addictive. I myself, a very small-brained individual who prefers FPS and action games, over something very methodical and small like this. But still, XCOM was an intriguing game for me, and even me with my stupidity really got into this game. Of course I never played the classics, and probably never will, since it's even more brutal than this one, but EU, and more specifically its expansion Enemy Within, is a very interesting and deep game, that can be entry for the genre that most people can enjoy.

The story is simple, aliens are real, but they are very evil and cruel. Their next step in the galactic conquest is Earth. To stop them, the collective government of the world launch the XCOM project, to combat alien threat. You are the Commander of the XCOm and you ahve full control of what is going on in this project. With the help of team of talented scientists and engieneers, and a batallion of soldiers, you will have to find a way to stop this menace once and for all, and save the Earth. 
The overall presentation of the story here most of the time tries to go for this action-horror vibe, your enemies are disgusting and vile in their nature, going as low as possible to achieve their goals, while your soldiers trying overcome their limits and fears for the greater good.
I feel like there was geniuine effort to make this game something more than ""Alines bad, go kill them"" with the deep lore and stuff, especially at the last mission, but everything leads to suvh an anti-climactic ending, that you don't even understand what's going on. Did we win? What happened to my squad on the ship? But overall the story is not the reason you are going to play this game.

The graphics of the game are solid for their time, but it shows its age. Everything looks simple and smooth, but lacks certain details. The fact that camera is so zoomed out from the action really helps to mask imperfections of the visuals, but try to zoom in and you will see some stuff must've been sacrificed for more stable performace. The soldier models look especially bad up-close. In some cutscenes, if your soldier is not a unique unit, saved on a special mission, will look like a total mess. The best part are the alien designs. they all unique and interesting, but some of the later stage aliens I'm not a fan of.
OST is actually pretty good, but lacks variety and hearing same songs over and over during the course of 20-60 hour campaign can get really tiring.
Also the game has some bugs. My saves got corrupted couple of times, and the would crash. Sometimes the game won't load certain textures, or sometimes units on the field. So probably use auto saves, and hope that your Ironman run won't be ruined by something like this.

The game is split into two parts, management of your XCOM base, and actual on the field missions controlling the squad of soldiers. And there is A LOT of mechanics with each of them. With the base you have to manage your resources, control panic levels of each country, assign research projects for the science team, build new rooms and facilities within the base, and there is so much of all of this that you will probably be overwhelmed at first and you very first run will definentely be a disaster. As someone who tried to play all this, my first 3 runs failed simply because I didn't understand the importance of satellites and your aircraft. A couple of guides an d abandoned attmpts later I got almost perfect game on Normal difficulty, which is perfect for a low IQ individual like me, don't judge.

On the ground you control the squad of 4-6 soldiers, each with their own unique abilities. At first the only diffrence are the classes but later, with the expansion, you can change them even more by introducing genetic modifications and mechanical augmentations into the equation. But still, your soldiers are just people, and they are prone to fail. Something that the game makes very clear at the start, and even in the tutorial, your soldiers will die here, you can't save everyone. You will lose people in fights and you have to come to terms with that. That being said, no one is indispensible. If you play right, you will have plenty of capable soldiers that can the place of the lost unit and help you win this war. Just try to have a rotation of soldiers that will attempt different missions and have them at hand in case you need to replace wounded/dead unit.
The game is really hard at first. You have awful weapons, aim of your people sucks, they panic at the sight of their own blood, you have limited funding with no resources, and you don't even know what enemies are capable of. Eventually, with a lot of careful planning and preparation, you will get stronger and start actually getting somewhere, and the endgame actually will be pretty easy despite enemies introducing more powerful units. Just be patient and smart, and everything will pay out at  the end, when all of your squad being outfitted in most powerful armor, armed with plasma weapons that will one-shot most enemies in the game.

So yeah, this game is hard as hell, but rewarding and satisfying. If you never played turn-based strategies and want to give genre a shot, this is a perfect start. 
Also veterans of the genre seem to like this game as well, so if some dumb idiot that struggled with this game on Normal is not a good enough recommendation, look at the loyal and vast community that this game garnered and incredible mod support it has.",1616785610,1616785610,True,9,0,0.650468766689300537,0,True,False,False

I was hungry for more unfair turn-based combat after nearly 6 years of 3.5 D&D, and he recommended XCOM, with little knowledge of the deep dive I was about to take. Not to split hairs here, I ate this **** up. Funny enough I had played The Bureau 3 years before, and had known about the series through that lens. Disregarding my poor misconceptions, I gave this game a try. Thinking I was a real gamer, I ticked off ironman and impossible, and started my first game. If you have read the other reviews, you'd figure this ended very quickly. This is not the kind of game that many of us are used to. You don't need to play the hardest difficulty for a challenge, you need to play rookie so you can scrape by while a superior military tells you who is boss. In more ways than one, this is a challenge the likes of which you will not be prepared for, which is not unlike what the Earth might face against a legitimate alien threat. In fact, the next game assumes you lost this one, and is in many ways, harder than this one. But when you do win, you will feel an amount of pride and satisfaction that is hard to emulate or describe. There is a point where these games turn around, where you get the game, where your soldiers give the aliens a run for their money and you win, and win hard.

This review is a truncated version based on the upper character limit for Steam reviews. For the full version, watch the video.

A few months ago, I played a game where I compared its turn-based tactical gameplay to XCOM’s. At the time, I didn’t think much about making this comparison, but it soon dawned on me that I only knew the gameplay of XCOM: Enemy Unknown through second hand experience and pop culture osmosis and that I’ve never actually experienced the game I was using as a point of comparison.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown puts the player in the role of the commander of the titular XCOM organization, a military and research outfit created by a global council tasked with defending earth from alien attacks. Since the title of the game is Enemy Unknown, this is exactly what the player is up against over the course of the campaign.

You have to figure out who the alien menace is, how they operate, what their goals are, research their physiology, biology and technology and most importantly to stop them from reaching said goal by involving them in the previously outlined tactical combat missions. During those missions, you control up to six units and are usually tasked with killing all the alien units on the map. There are a few other missions thrown in there where you have different objectives, such as rescuing civilians, escorting VIPs or capturing an alien specimen alive for further study, but mostly it’s about combat.

The gameplay of those missions is fairly simplistic, the actions you can take range from firing on enemies with in range to using items like explosive or smoke grenades or replenishing health with medkits and you can also just hunker down behind cover and put your units into a state called overwatch, where they basically wait and ambush any enemy unit that happens to cross their line of sight. The game rewards cautious play over recklessly charging in guns blazing. This is doubly true because of the fact that soldiers can get injured or killed during these missions. Injured soldiers will need to recuperate for a few in-game days. Soldiers killed in action will permanently stay dead, meaning you’ll lose all the abilities you’ve unlocked with them and you’ll have to train with a new rookie to get them levelled up again.

I think a missed opportunity here is the fact that losing soldiers is only seen as a downside regarding gameplay. Because even though every soldier gets a randomized name, face and country of origin and they can even be further customized by the player, they don’t actually feature into the narrative in the slightest, they’re little more than literal canon fodder.

The only characters in this narrative are the people at your XCOM HQ, who talk at you from time to time. But the thing is that all of these interactions are mostly expository in nature. Your character can’t talk, so these people either talk at you or amongst themselves, but there’s very little characterization given to them, beyond very basic archetypal traits. Every piece of dialogue is always about the current task at hand and nothing else and as such, the whole affair seems kind of lifeless. 

I mean, the basic gist of this game is that it’s supposed to put you into a desperate role where you have to fight for the survival of humanity against a technologically superior alien menace with very limited resources. And this is only compounded by the fact that many missions are structured in a way that have three missions happen around the world simultaneously and you can only choose to engage in one of them. The catch is that every country has a panic indicator that rises when something happens and you don’t address it. If the panic level rises too high, the country will pull support from the XCOM project entirely, therefore taking away all their funding from it. This retreat is treated entirely as a financial consequence for later operations, not in terms of how humanity actually reacts and deals with this on a civilian level. I mean, it’s not like the fact that aliens are invading is some kind of secret operation, this is clearly public knowledge. How does humanity adapt to this scenario? And why would it choose to only give limited funds to an organization tasked with protecting the planet against such a threat? This is never really addressed, the alien menace is treated purely as a generic foe for gameplay to happen, not to explore any themes, which I think is a bit of a missed opportunity.

Outside of missions, you can research and manufacture equipment at your HQ, customize soldiers and their loadouts and excavate and build additional facilities to generate enough energy for future installations needed to research and build stuff faster. There’s also a grey market where you can sell alien tech and corpses to generate additional revenue in order to pay for all those gadgets. 

This constant repetition with very little in the way of narrative flourishes means that the game largely looks and feels identical for vast stretches of playing and as such I eventually lost interest in continuing on after around 15 hours without completing the campaign. I mean, even though the game is called Enemy Unknown, there doesn’t seem to be a lot to learn about said enemy in the first place, and if there is, it takes way too long to actually get to those parts. At some point it just kind of ran out of steam for me, even though for a few hours it did have that addictive quality of doing just one more mission or just one more turn.

But eventually, this feeling faded away and it also gave way to a few annoyances that kept cropping up. I’m not really a fan of the fact that enemies seem to be able to do way more during their turn than you. You seem to be severely disadvantaged on pretty much every front, be it either by enemies having abilities that seem to hit 100% of the time or even just enemies having way more health than even your most advanced soldiers. And again, I get that the game intends to put you in a defensive role where you’re forced to react to an overly powerful enemy, but sometimes the playing field seems too much stacked in the enemy's favor.

It also doesn’t help that for some reason, unless you have a specific upgrade, firing your guns means ending your turn regardless of the fact that you still have unspent action points. I’m really not sure why this is, why can’t my soldier fire off a shotgun blast while they’re right next to an enemy that has walked up to them during their turn and then retreat behind some more distant cover, rather than first having to fall back and then attempt the shot with a now way lower chance of hitting the intended target?

Another constant annoyance was the rate of missing shots. I’m aware how percentages work and that a 90% chance of a hit still means that it can miss. And I also know that these percentages aren’t cumulative, so you can have a 90% hit chance and still miss 9 out of 10 shots, because that’s how statistics work. But regardless of how statistics work, it feels terrible as a player.

I’m not sure how to conclude this review. On the one hand, the core gameplay loop is fun, even when considering the frequent misses. It really does have an addictive quality to it. But the previously mentioned annoyances regarding frequent misses and the bewildering design decision of not allowing movement after weapon discharge, the lack of any strong narrative throughline, the random and very repetitive nature of the missions mean that I’m not sure if I can unequivocally recommend this game. Maybe it’s just me. Strategy and tactics games aren’t my preferred genres to begin with and it’s a miracle that XCOM: Enemy Unknown managed to draw me in with its core gameplay loop, so you might want to take my opinion with a massive mountain of salt. But unfortunately, after everything is said and done, I have to conclude that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is at best slightly above average.",1615934294,1615934294,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Being a turn-based strategy game, I expected more from the gameplay strategy options. The combat is so simple that the only difficulty stems from acts of randomness (like aliens spawning randomly over the map, soldiers randomly missing or hitting) and one alien type being invisible. That results in a simple strategy to always win - keep your soldiers together, so they can protect each other, and hope that you hit. If a soldier tries to flank, they'll get punished or even die, so just don't do it. Also, equip each soldier with a leg transplant, which regenerates health every round, and you're soldiers will basically be invincible. I could be braindead and win with this strategy every single time...

Also, I find working with the base extremely silly, it's way more complicated than it really should be (from UI perspective), and it doesn't really add anything to the game (at least for me). Most of the time, I'm just waiting there and hoping to finally get some action.

The game is very much not in your favor at the beginning but once you start your engine then things really start to work well. The synergies between different squad mates could be better... After playing Xcom 2 i started noticing that much more. I feel the way the game randomizes freak outs from your squad mates very frustrating.. especially at the beginning. When your squaddie sees someone die they then proceed to kill other squad members in a hail of bullets... ya that's a hard restart. Luckily a mod helps with that kind of thing but still.

So I never played the original ones for Windows 95 but i hear they are a lot more complex than this one. I hope the next iteration of xcom will incorporate more of those strategical elements into the game and less handicapping. I wouldn't be opposed to another reboot but more authentic to the original. 

Then again i could just play xenonaughts if i wanted a more authentic feel..

Now, to preface, I must say I absolutely loved the original X-com UFO defense, having a hundred hours on the steam version and probably a couple hundred in open X-com. The original X-com is an absolute masterpiece. It captures its intended vibe so effectively. With that said, this reboot is somehow even better. It streamlines things (in a good way) and adds a whole heaping dose of new content. Furthermore, the campaign actually has some semblance of a story. The original one kinda just had a loose amalgamation of objectives that would eventually result in the final assault on mars. This game, on the other hand, has a full-blown story with a good amount of cutscenes. From this point forward, there are some light spoilers ahead: The first time I saw the base defense cutscene, I was blown away. In the original UFO defense and terror from the deep, the assault just happens if you don’t shoot down lurking battleships. In this game, it’s a full-blown assault from the aliens rather than just a group of sectoids with rocket launchers. On top of that, your supervisor friend dude in the green fleece sweater provides ample entertainment throughout the entire game. He’s cheesy as hell, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. The rest of the cast isn’t as fun, but they’re still rounded out enough to get the job down. Gameplay-wise, the game is amazing. Long gone are the days of being physonicaly attacked from across the map or facing the line of site bug. Everything just makes sense. Just like its predecessor, the late game is pretty much just your squad absolutely destroying everything in their path, and its absolutely marvelous. Seeing a squad of decked-out cyborgs and op soldiers just melt the shit that had given you trouble at the early game is just so satisfying. Granted, it may get boring if you’ve done multiple runs, or you’re doing a playthrough where you purposely never finish the game, but damn is seeing a cyberdisc get one shot o-so satisfying. The only real complaint i have about this game is that some of the animations aren’t properly sinked, and the rigging on the particle cannon is wrong, so it does this weird movement thing after you fire. Other than that, the game is effectively perfect. (unless you think it’s too hard, which is a fair complaint, but honestly I don’t mind. It just makes the late game more rewarding.) To conclude, buy the damn game. It’s great, and it goes on sale for super cheap, so you don’t have to worry about losing too much money on the game if you don’t like it.",1615033300,1615033489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can get a lot of enjoyement from this game. I bought the complete edition for only 6€ on sale and I think It's absolutely worth it.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
- The storyline is pretty good.
- 20+hrs of gameplay
- Base management / upgrades
- Character customization
- Many weapons to choose from.
- Soldier classes with unique abilities.
- Ironman mode (which is, you cannot save the game on your own, you can only use autosaves. This way you can't load back at every mistake you make and the game feels more intense and challenging.)
- Losing good soldiers actually feel bad (Especially if you play on ironman)

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- Sometimes characters can shoot through walls and covers. (In 1 mission, through an entire huge rock)
- Character customization is not that deep.
- Some enemies feel unfair and way too OP (Like the Sectopod)
- Berserker attack lags the game
- Graphics sometimes look a bit outdated for today's standards.
- Sometimes NPCs will miss from a 1 tile distance from the enemy. (This is just nit-picking but it's a thing)

[b][u]Bonus:[/u][/b]
- If you really enjoy the game and you don't want it to be over, download the ""Long War"" mod, which makes the game much longer and changes the game a little bit for diversity.
I didn't try out this mod I'm just saying that this kind of mod exists for those who want to get many more hours out of this game.

[b]9/10[/b] Absolutely worth the money.

The Good
- Tactical class with diff abilities. When combined properly it helps to overcome great challenges. Nice combination of abilities
- DLC makes it even better with extra mods to your troops
- Wide variety of weapons, making strategy a complex battle. Spoiler: You get self guiding RPGs
- Fun turn based battles. 

The Bad & The Ugly
- UI not responsive. Some buttons don't respond to clicking if you're off center. Like the X on mobile games
- The snap to squares are terrible, especially in elevated terrains. It will move your troops or open a door which you didnt select at all or even when its really far away
- Disappointing story and bad acting. Like it doesnt give you the feel of a secret military organisation. Infact the whole fantasy is utterly disappointing
- Even more disappointing aliens, especially the UFOpedia. Previous xcom games have this over the top UFOpedia. If you played xcom apocalypse, you would know the beauty. Here it seems they skimped ALOT
- And the biggest FAILURE of this game - LINEAR
  = Everything you do in the game is linear. The way troops and planes are equipped. Hell, there are only 2 planes total in the game and you can only have one troops transport instead of multiples. Only one base and your troops no longer have bagpack inventory
 = Alien AI is useless. It is a turn based game BUT when you meet aliens, they get to move IN YOUR TURN!!! This is the biggest turn off of the whole game. Not only that but the aliens are always in groups. They NEVER try to seek you out and stay in their general locations, waiting for you to find them. This alone is the main reason this game is terrible
 = It is so linear the start of the game what you do is actually scripted, that is if you played the game before. To prevent losing the game from losing the council members (which is very easy by the way. and this distracts you from the main game) you have to follow very strict, linear steps. If you do play, I do advise to read on ""How to maintain xcom council members"" before starting.
 = Even the tutorial is terrible. Killing my squad is part of the tutorial. And the tutorial gives you a free satellite which you dont get if u skip it. Which is pretty dumb. 
 = The animations take alot of time, and wastes even more. As aliens have an advantage over you, from both tech, configuration and the cheating moving during your turn, you spend alot of time moving slowly and going into overwatch. I got so fed up of it I just save/load and rushed in to save myself alot of time and sanity.

Overall, it is fun enough to complete but so terrible that I would never ever play it a second time. Pls get this game on discount. The best fantasy feeling still comes from xcom apocalypse.",1614428611,1614428611,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

My opinion about this game is mostly based on these two mods, The base game in comparison feels more like a long tutorial to get the hang of the basic mechanics (flanking/cover/abilities). It has depth but cannot be played as varied, since many skillset/equipment choices are simply less viable than others. This issue is fixed by installing one of the mods (both at the same time won't work properly).

There are plenty of atmospheric maps and mission. There's so much one can do wrong in this game, there's so much to do right in this game. Countless of tactical and strategical decisions and variations on how to approach different situations. So many tightly balanced abilities, skills & equipment to choose from. 

The purchase is a no-brainer for anyone with even the slightest interest in turn-based strategy games. Can't recommend this gem highly enough.",1614369227,1614372030,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I personally recommend this game with the caveat that you also purchase the complete pack containing all DLC, as I did this time around. More clarification on the DLC further in this review for now I’ll start with the pros/cons of this game:

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list][*]Easy to follow alien invasion plot containing familiar science fiction elements
[*]Substantial & compelling campaign enhanced by DLC missions
[*]Missions take place within a variety of detailed, visually appealing environments
[*]Incredible atmospheric soundtrack/SFX
[*]5 distinct soldier classes to choose from with unique abilities depending on their specialization
[*]Surprisingly robust character customization for soldiers (using presets)
[*]Diverse roster of enemies requires appropriate tactics & keeps the player carefully planning their next move
[*]4 difficulty levels allow for accessible or challenging gameplay & offers replayability when paired with ‘second wave options’ included in the DLC
[*]As the game progresses, the player is forced to make more difficult & impactful decisions in order to advance
[*]Strong sense of progression as you complete missions & steadily upgrade your soldiers[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list][*]Key objectives to story progression are not always clear
[*]Most maps lack complexity resulting in repetitious linear advancement towards the objective
[*]Reliance on fog of war where enemies typically remain in place instead of actively seeking out the player
[*]Unnecessary, awkward initial encounter animations (e.g. witnessing a sectoid doing the whole deer in headlights act for the umpteenth time)
[*]The fact that you will inexplicably get fu**** over at some point playing this game, like getting shot through solid cover or missing a shot at point-blank range (I’m definitely not salty I lost my ironman progress). To be clear this has nothing to do with the RNG elements of the game, I’m referring to instances where the actual mechanics were never explained or clear to begin with.[/list]

[b]Review:[/b]
8 years on and XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within is still able to deliver a fun and engaging turn-based strategy experience on par with the vast majority of alternatives out there. It’s a testament to developer Firaxis successfully rebooting and modernizing XCOM as a series. Pioneering isn’t the right term, but this game was definitely at the forefront of the genre on release and the gameplay still holds its weight to this day.

In terms of story the alien invasion trope has been handled well here, while playing through it struck me in terms of how likely this scenario is IRL. Just imagine aliens are invading and instead of humanity banding together to face this new unknown threat you have a single decentralized organization being funded by 16 individual nations. All of a sudden Argentina is butthurt (typical) wants to pull funding and drop out because they didn’t have their request for satellite coverage fulfilled. Jeez I’m sorry Argentina but what the actual f*** are you going to do after you drop out? FINE THEN LEAVE, I’M SURE THE ALIENS WILL HAPPILY USE TANGO TO REFER TO YOU AND NOT YOUR STUPID FU***** DANCE!

Politics aside though, as the game progresses you will feel a sense of urgency to fulfil council requests and maintain panic levels, keeping individual nations happy is important because it can lead to continent bonuses which are quite the incentive. Aside from that managing resources isn’t too much of a challenge if you’re sensible about things, just focus on how you play the missions and you’ll do fine.

In XCOM the real adversity you’ll need to overcome is the loss of a good soldier, not only does it tend to be a setback in terms of progression, you’ll also find yourself becoming attached to your battle-hardened veterans. Without telling you how to have fun, my suggestion would be not to save scum if you get the urge, at least not on your first playthrough. I feel like part of the intended experience is learning the hard way from your mistakes, evidenced by the presence of the memorial facility which commemorates fallen soldiers.

The final thing I need to mention is the DLC, let me break it down for you:
[list][*]Enemy Within: Must have expansion that adds so much content to the game
[*]Operation Slingshot: Bonus Missions
[*]Elite Solider Pack: Cosmetics[/list]
If you must choose between them then you should prioritize getting Enemy Within, however make sure you buy it on sale, full price is not worth it.

Overall I enjoyed every aspect of this game in some capacity and it served its purpose priming me for XCOM 2, which I’m looking forward to playing in the near future. Definitely glad I took the time to revisit it and if you haven’t played this game yet add it to your wishlist and buy it next time it goes on sale for a more reasonable price.

Highly reccomended to get the expansion as the added tactical and strategic considerations are very good and make the game's gameplay loop much more fun.

If you've experienced the game and want more I'd also highly recommend the mod Long War Rebalance as it  fixes my one gripe with the game, that of the reverse difficulty curve as in base game the hardest missions are when your starting as you have limited tactical options and rookies that can't hit the broadside of a barn, but if you play well and learn to use the mechanics you'll eventually find that endgame missions are much more easy than your initial missions; but with the mod I'm recommending it makes it so that the difficulty curve is actually always at a satisfying pace all the time

An absolute classic that is a must play for turn-based strategy fans. XCOM is brilliant because it separates your victory conditions (kill aliens) from your defeat conditions (worldwide panic), making it possible to win the battle but lose the war. Combat is very challenging, but careful tactics will nearly always give you an edge. Replayability is high due to several different soldier builds, multiple victory strategies, well scaled difficulties, and expansions with more development paths. While XCOM is one of the best games I have played, it is not perfect. Satellites trump all other developments; labs are next to useless; soldier panic during combat is maddening; and pacing in the expansion is really off.
[hr][/hr]
XCOM is a true classic. Back in the Paleolithic era – when people were actually [b]good[/b] at giving directions and 64 MB of RAM was hot shit – turn-based strategy games were everywhere. Once FPS and RTS titles took over the market, turn-based strategy games (that were not also 4X) had a stigma of being too simple and boring. XCOM proved that turn-based strategy could be challenging and fun, and it literally rebooted the genre. Very few games have had as much impact on their genre as XCOM, and that is why it is a must play for turn-based fans.

XCOM is brilliant because they completely separated the victory conditions from the loss conditions. You win by building a team of soldiers to kick the aliens into next Tuesday, but you lose by not managing strategic assets that prevent the world from falling into panic. In all senses, you really can win the battle, but lose the war.

Deep management strategies are required, and you will be pushed to the limit. You have to balance base logistics with technology advancement/production with soldier support with soldier advancement with support personnel with worldwide panic. You can’t just pick the mission with the best reward; you might have to pick the mission to Brazil to prevent Argentina from falling into panic. You will run out of money; you will run out of alien alloys needed to build tech; you will have to pick which country goes into panic; you will not have enough power in your base; you will not have enough engineers to build the satellites that will keep Russia from falling to panic; and you will do all of this when you are doing it right. Then, with the spare change you got from sifting through the couch, you can pick a couple ways to make your team better. 

Eventually you do hit a turning point where the war of attrition is over and you can start taking the fight to the aliens. Making it that far is the challenge.

The tactical part of the game is also very challenging and well done. Aliens are better equipped and have better stats than you. They can rock your world until your first armor upgrade…and then you can [i]usually[/i] take [b]a[/b] hit. You will have casualties, make peace with that. 

The good news is that if you play the tactics carefully, you will always get 1 turn worth of actions before the aliens. From there, squad combat is all about making good use of basic tactics and your soldier’s abilities. Advance under cover and with fire support…but don’t open up fog of war where more aliens could be hiding. Grenades and other explosives are your friend. Smoke grenades and suppression are much more useful than a shot with a 40% to hit. Etc.

Most class abilities are balanced (except for you, Flush shot). Some abilities will be very easy to use effectively (Lightning Reflexes), while others are individually weak but strong when combined with related abilities (Suppression oriented abilities). This gives you a lot of choice to build a very diverse team that suits your playstyle.

Replayability is high because you can choose different builds and tech development for your soldiers, and higher difficulties kick up the challenge enough to make the game play differently. Normal is soft enough that you can afford to do several things inefficiently. On Classic you need to keep your eye on the ball…assuming you know what the ball looks like. And then there is Impossible…even if you do everything correctly, you will frequently loose early due to random chance. Ironman helps you to resist the temptation of loading after a really bad turn…well, ok, the temptation is still there, you just can’t do it.

Despite how much I love this game, it isn’t perfect. I hate the “panic” mechanic…especially when your team starts shooting at each other. It both breaks my immersion (how are these Earth’s “best”), and it creates a completely random way to screw you (which is counter to the entire concept of a great strategy game). Fortunately, someone on the dev team knew how stupid it was and made it virtually impossible to fail the check once your soldier hits level 3.

There are also a few strategies that are much more important and effective (satellites, satellites, satellites), and a few that are next to useless (laboratories). This makes your strategic options more limited on a replay. While you still get some choice on how to develop your team, you will probably feel like 90% of your grand strategy is the same.

Line of sight rules, weapon ranges, and explosive zones can also get squirrelly at times. At some point you will move a soldier up only to find you can no longer ""see"" your  intended target. Most people condone save scumming at times like these.

I enjoyed the pacing of the original game. The Enemy Within expansion adds two super cool soldier development options and new mission objectives. This adds a lot of fun for veterans, but it really screws up the game pacing. You get tougher aliens and missions much, much earlier. This creates a higher probability for a tough mission success (wounded soldiers) leading to a tough follow-up mission with nearly all Rookies (who are essentially dead without experienced soldiers supporting them). So, if you are actually new to XCOM, I highly recommend that you turn off both “Operations” in the options menu (if you have them) and not playing Enemy Within on your first playthrough.

What about XCOM2 you say? Yes, I think XCOM2 is better. It cleaned up a lot of the more subtle, clunky aspects of XCOM. But if you haven’t played either, my vote is for you to play the one that revived an entire genre first. Plus, the XCOM2 story is much more fun if you’ve experienced XCOM first.",1614056102,1614093550,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most examples from the beginning of the game, later game features lessening most problems, but that just shows this problems are created, the game designed this way.

What is good:
- As a tabletop game, it is excellent. If you fine with it then forget my review, go and buy it.
- Soldier classes are fun. They are very different and soon you will love their abilities.
- Game is very narrative, in base management the team leaders has their own perceptions and opinions.

What is bad (because it is just a tabletop game):
- From the multiple alien attack sites you can send help only to one, angering everyone else. In X-COM you can send multiple squads all over the world.
- The ""do what you want"" Action Points system replaced with a ""move and action"" system. You move closer then shoot at the alien and now it their turn, bad luck if they survived your attack! In the old version you can shoot again or just retreat and hide behind a cover, before they can react. This deadly hide and seek was fun and the aliens use it as well!
- Only four soldiers in a squad (later six), that limits your tactics and losing one of them can be crippling. In the old version, you can have more than a dozen soldiers in a squad.
- Forced tactical rules, camping is punished by lower accuracy, flanking is rewarded by extra critical.
- Most of the time aliens do nothing until contact, but will spot you immediately and move behind cover in ""your"" turn. It is like placing figures on a tabletop, because your soldier figure stepped on an ""encounter happens"" tile. In X-COM aliens moving around, resulting unexpected contacts where the badly positioned side could die quickly.
- No inventory management, there are few equipment slots to place equipment into them. For example you could choose an extra armor, an aim system for your weapons, one grenade or one medikit. But you can choose one only of them, because they are all ""item slot"" types. In X-COM you can overload your soldiers with various equipment, if you see that fit. That gives a lot of possibilities, like frag buildings because that was less dangerous than walk in to fight the aliens room by room.
- You can't pick up items. The fallen Nurse Betty will die with a medkit on her belt, because others can't access it. Private Brave can't pick up the dead heavy soldier's rocket launcher to send that dangerous alien robot to hell. Meanwhile in X-COM several soldier was saved and battles was win, because soldiers can pick up items.
- You can't shoot objects on the map, in X-COM making entrances through walls was a valid strategy.
- While all of the above problems could be overlooked as a tabletop game rules, the worst one ruin it all. It seems - too frequently  - your soldiers miss the aliens while the aliens can kill your soldiers unexpectedly. You can't win a battle with your best moves when all of your soldiers miss their targets from few steps away and the aliens kills your fully covered soldiers from far away.",1613835540,1613835874,False,0,0,0.473372787237167358,1,True,False,False

The only (but critical) downside is the unbalanced game difficulty. The game starts super easy but the enemy precision escalates ridicilously fast. It is a bit annoying to realize that your naive mistakes in base management at the beginning of the game causes a chain reaction, resulting in an unbeatable playthrough hours later. Some might annoy this kind of risk but I don't. That is why I chose to play on normal difficulty (still hard to manage at some points). 

The game requires two playthroughs: one trial and error play in which you will definitely be annihilated and another you will win if you learn from your mistakes. This might sound too much investment, but the effort is worth it.

If you are a fan of strategy games like I am, I cannot recommend XCOM enough. Every combat encounter feels super intense, due to the music, and the fact that permadeath is a major feature of this game. After missions, your soldiers will often earn the opportunity to gain new abilities based on their class. Combine this with the fact that you can completely edit your soldiers' names and appearance, and you will be totally invested in their survival, making their deaths that much more tragic. Nothing is more painful than watching a soldier go from Rookie, all the way to Colonel, only to watch them get gunned down by a muton because you made the wrong move.

I will stress that this game can be very difficult and punishing at times. Every combat encounter involves a fog of war, limiting your view of the battlefield, obscuring the aliens from view, until one of your soldiers spots them. My advice is, do not rush into battles: be slow and methodical. Once the aliens are spotted, they essentially get a free turn to move, regardless of where you are in your turn. This might mean that sometimes you might find your soldier moving into good cover, only to discover that a couple of aliens you couldn't see a few seconds ago are now flanking that soldier, meaning that he/she will probably die.

While I really like this game, it is not perfect. The base building kind of slows the pacing a bit, since in order to advance the game, you need to build certain facilities, which means that you might have to wait a few in-game weeks in order to advance the story. All of your attacks are based on a percentage of hitting: for example, when you decide to attack an alien, the game will tell you that your shot has a ""70%"" chance of hitting. This percentage is decided by how good the enemy's cover is, as well as how close your soldier is to their target. In general, this works, but sometimes it feels like the game deliberately makes your soldiers miss when you need them to hit the most, causing you to lose a soldier. To be fair though, it sometimes works in reverse, where aliens will miss shots that they should have it.

In conclusion, I am a huge fan of XCOM, and I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of sci-fi or strategy games.",1613531954,1613531954,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-High replay value 
-Long war mod(100+hours campaign) for serious TBS people who are looking for a challenge,after completing vanilla at least on classic difficulty
-low system requirements back in 2014 my old AMD 6670 ddr5 could+dual core AMD CPU ran it maxed 60fps,
-still looks somewhat decent
-good atmopshere Imo it is better than the one in Xcom 2
-it also features aircombat unlike Xcom2 I like it,many people find air game lackuster though.
-very fast loading times even on HDD less than 5 seconds.

Neutral:
-The game has no steam workshop support,it has way less mods than Xcom2.
-The game is hard and there is rng in it,some people may find it frustrating,there is a good chance that your first campaign will fail.
-Hardest difficulty during first 2 month has balance issues compared to hardest Xcom 2 difficulty like first month bomb missions.
-Xcom 1 and 2 has reserve difficulty,many times early game can be harder than late game.
-Maps are handcrafted,eventually you will see repetions(very very unlikely in a single playtrough).

Cons:
-Imo Enemy unknown alone by itself is not worth it,teleporting aliens bug,not many items,no gene mods,exalt,mechs etc.
-Sometimes win 10 updates can break the launcher forcing you to troubleshoot your game,usually solved by verify game files steam function.

I suggest to play XCom EW which is basically improved Xcom EU with less bugs,expanded research and other options like gene modes+new alien types etc more difficult upper 2 difficulties,less difficult lower 2 difficulties.

Good luck Commander!!

- It is really well balanced. All soldiers classes and alien races have all perks that make them unique.
- The graphics aged really well for a 2020 game. The artists made a really good job, whether on the chara design, the music or the levels.
- It is a game with a difficulty that is not found elsewhere. I normally dislike very hard games, but this one has a balance that makes it 'hard but fair'. But in the beginning of the game you really feel this 'unique pressure of command'. One big mistake and the game is lost.
- It blends management and strategy. Despite it somewhat procedural aspect, the NPCs and special events still put some life and some scenario behind it. 
- Turn by turn combat is just great. I wish Obsidian would consider it :/

I was eager to buy XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but was quickly disappointed with the simplicity of of it. That was on the back of having just played a lot of the old X-COM Apocalypse (1997).

It' not like all the X-COM games have been good so far, in fact some of them that I've tried or seen are quite lackluster. Of the older ones, I'd only recommend the first (X-COM: Enemy Unknown, 1994), second (X-COM: Terror From the Deep, 1995) and the third game (X-COM: Apocalypse, 1997) in the series.

The newer XCOM: EU is just so streamlined, that it feels very shallow to me. Maybe I'll just have to get used to the new simpler home base with less personality, guns that don't require ammunition management, the new time unit system (action per turn as opposed to time unit points to spend) and so forth.

The best way I can describe it is that It just doesn't have that captivating, exciting, classic X-COM feel anymore. Not to me.

It's an OK game, but it seems after 20 years all that has been achieved is an incredibly dumbed down version,with a huge lack of playability... though the graphics are better.

For those that like reading, here is my list of issues with this poorly implemented game:
- Only a single base, meaning no base defence missions or task tailored bases.
- No way to sell old gear and equipment, even at a huge loss (picture tons of crap clogging inventory lists).
- Automatic troop class determination. What if I simply don't want five 'heavies'?
- Imposed restrictions on what troop classes can employ. Why can't a heavy use a standard pistol?
- Awful tactical engine. Where to start... this is so dumbed down that tactics don't really come into it. 
- Ridiculous inventory limitations. Seriously, a soldier can't wear/carry more than a single item along with his gun?
- No real ""skill"" progression. Skills basically just cover for lack of equipment variation (e.g. ""heat ammo"" skill), the limited inventory (e.g. ""additional smoke grenade"" skill) or unbelievably dumbed down tactical engine (e.g. ""Bullet Swarm""... an entire skill just so you can shoot before you move)!?
- Expensive basic actions. Reload, turn over. Shoot once, turn over. Use medkit, turn over... and so on.
- Small squad size of only 4 (6 if you pay for it), with tiny gun clips and one item each (think of an alien base assault)!
- Bugs. Mostly minor irritants, but years after release the UI hit percentages still don't always display correctly.

I really wanted to play this and waited ages for the 16.7GB download to complete, only to be disappointed at how bad the developers, supposed ""die-hard"" X-com fans, had made it. They created a game that sounded great on paper, but is devoid of most choices, options and tactics present in the original all those years ago.

To me it seems like just another awesome PC game butchered to be a cash grab and appeal more to the console generation.

If you're wondering why I've put so much time into this game, it's because I kept coming back hoping I would start to like it due to how much I enjoyed the originals.

Whenever your team successfully returns from a mission, you can promote a soldier who's managed to score a kill. So level up is based on how many kills a certain soldier did. Oh and you can change his name, appearance, etc. The combat is classical turn-based and can be really fun. There are different classes available to hire, like assault, support, heavy and sniper. So each has it's own strengths and weaknesses, so there's a lot of variety.  If RNG doesn't spoil your gameplay experience this game can be tons of fun. And there's base building, which was fine I guess. Those who like to micro-manage stuff will like it. Well there's not much else to say, since most of the players here already know the series.

That daunting proposition is at the heart of XCOM: Enemy Unknown

Strategy game from Firaxis and 2K. 
Players manage the paramilitary XCOM project, deciding what new projects to research and what new technology to produce so that the XCOM troopers go into battle with the best equipment possible.
Do well and the funding nations will pour even more money into the XCOM project.
 Do poorly and the nations will pull out, leaving the project with even fewer resources to fight back the alien invasion.

The absolute best aspect of XCOM is the sense that there’s never enough time or resources to do everything that needs to be done. 
Do you pull a trooper off of active duty to undergo psionic training or do you keep him out in the field where he can get better at his core skills? 
Do you spend your budget producing satellites to help locate UFOs or do you spend that same money producing interceptors to be sure you can shoot down the few UFOs you do locate?

Every moment of XCOM is defined by these either/or decisions where every move involves some sort of sacrifice or compromise. 
When you combine that with the overall tone of the game, which emphasizes a DEFCON style countdown to a complete alien takeover, the whole experience is fantastically tense and engaging.

Unfortunately, in order to create that tension XCOM ramps up the difficulty and leaves you in the dark about some pretty important goals. 
That doesn’t necessarily count that as a criticism, because the pressure of having to keep pace with the escalating threat and learning from your catastrophic mistakes is part of the game’s charm. Still, a few of the essential choices are presented in an either/or format and you may not realize the choice you ought to have made until it’s too late to do anything about it. 

Even your basic goals are largely open-ended at the beginning of the game, despite the presence of key research and infrastructure decisions that are vital to your early success. It’s best to think of your first game as a learning experience.
You want to make the right decisions because that’s what’s going to keep your soldiers alive. In between the strategic management phases, you’ll lead small squads of XCOM soldiers in turn-based tactical battles in a variety of locations – from cities to fields to highways to alien bases. 

As your soldiers gain experience, they also unlock valuable promotions that open up new abilities. 
It’s a great system, not only because it gives you a constant sense of progression as you open up new powers, but also because it allows you to tailor each soldier’s abilities to your own playstyle.
For the ultimate in personal attachment, you can even rename your soldiers and change their appearance to match your friends or co-workers. 
There’s nothing worse than seeing your best friend fall under a hail of plasma fire.

The missions are challenging, primarily because of the enemy AI and the way the individual enemies are designed. 
The thick-skinned Mutons, for instance, not only have thick armor, but can even become enraged and interrupt your turn with powerful cries that make your weaker-willed soldiers panic. 
The emaciated Ethereals can use psionic powers to shield themselves and even take control of your own units, forcing you into the terrible position of having to take down one of your own soldiers. 
Since each type of enemy has different abilities, you really have to adapt to each and every encounter, which is made even more challenging when more than one type of enemy gets involved in the battle. 
Choose poorly and you could be bringing home your soldiers in body bags.

Death is a big deal in XCOM and, by midway through the game, your Memorial to fallen soldiers, complete with bagpipe music, should have plenty of names on it. 
At harder difficulty levels, it can be tough to recover from the death of an experienced officer, but the tactical game virtually requires that death be a real and, more importantly, a recoverable error for you.
 It’s all part of that feeling of being two steps behind the aliens and frantically trying to catch up. 
Thankfully, later in the game, your new advancements and high-level recruiting options mean the project can still live on even if two of your best Majors suddenly die in the field.

Within the framework of what XCOM is trying to do, there are really only two serious missteps in the tactical game. 
The first is that the enemies don’t seem very mobile until they see or hear you, meaning they won’t ever really surprise you. They simply sit and wait for you to get into their line of sight before moving to attack. 
This makes most of the levels in the game feel a bit like haunted houses, where the scares just sit and wait for you to come by. 
You’re generally free to reload and heal up in between taking on these small groups, which lessens the mission’s tension. 
To cheat around the possible exploitation of the aliens’ immobility, XCOM actually gives them a free move phase the first time they’re discovered. I
t’s an inelegant solution to the problem of predictable enemy placement.

The lack of elbow room compounds that problem. 
Instead of letting players exercise their tactical muscle through maneuver and exploration, here the tactical decisions are heavily weighted towards just picking the right abilities and managing your cover. 
This tendency leaves you essentially playing an RPG that feels more like a cover-based shooter than a strategy game. 
To be fair, position matters and you can flank enemies and destroy their cover, but there’s never enough room to really get inventive with your tactical positioning.

That said, the sheer destructibility of those environments is phenomenal. 
By the time you and the aliens have finished shooting it out you’ll have set cars on fire with your laser fire, blown walls out of supermarkets with rockets, and exploded rows of gas pumps with an errant grenade. 
It really sells the power and intensity of the battle to see these buildings reduced to flaming rubble. 
Better still, the cover created or destroyed during the battle can quickly change the tactical situation, which adds a much needed unpredictability to the battlefield and slightly alleviates the predictability of the enemy placement and lack of maneuver space.

So far, this review has avoided direct comparisons between this game and the original 1994 Microprose classic, partly because the expectations of today’s gamers are slightly different, but mostly because this title deserves to be judged on its own merits. 
But for those of you who were fans of the original, you should know the remake shares many of the themes and mechanics of the original but it’s still not as deep, tactically speaking. 
The streamlining certainly makes for a more convenient overall experience, but some of the finer details and sense of control have been lost.

Recently Firaxis has been very willing to try new things with its franchises, and it’s great to see both the revival of the XCOM franchise and the extension of strategy games on the consoles. 
You’re still likely to want a bit more depth and surprise in the tactical game, but the campaign is full of tense moments that are sure to keep you coming back for more.

XCOM is a great addition to the strategy genre, complete with an engaging campaign full of tension and challenges. 
The characters grow in satisfying ways, but the tactical game doesn't ever quite give players enough room to make the most of their abilities.",1610330239,1610330239,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

The OG dev team is good enough to balance the game while modders, mostly, will only add distractions instead of making game funnier as they claimed. They make games ridiculously sophisticated and redundant. As an example, there are 3 RNG tests u need to pass for a normal shot: first is about if u can hit them, this is easy as it is always shown; second is about your weapon damage, which is likely to be very low if no critical hit is guaranteed, the last one is about the amour of alien. The amour ranges from 0-4 for a seeker, the second mechanical alien combatant you will meet. As a funny example, i have a squad(6 ppl), everyone with 60% hit or more, struggles to kill a 5 health seekers in a full turn. And also LW Xcom has their grenades and rocket launchers made in china, which will solidify your belief in RNG god. Vanilla game, on the contrary, made a good balance between RNG and tactics and enjoyable. I'd say the original game is not perfect, some classes are not balanced(support are not as strong) and some aspects are over simplified(psi ability for example).

While looking for another game I figured out the SteamPlay thing and now it's working. My expectations were low based on what I had heard of the maps being ""tunnel vision.""
The maps are smaller than most XCOM games, but they are definitely adequate. There's no worry about getting fragged leaving the Skyranger as you are placed outside on the map from the start with no aliens in sight. The trade-off from time units to the new system isn't nearly as limiting as it seems, and the troop bonuses for leveling up are actually kind of nice. You squad doesn't start off as a bunch of sissies that can't hit a building from 10 squares away.
Another nicety is that grenades go where you expect them to. So much so that it seems to be a bit unfair compared to other weapons, but if you are in a pinch, you can lob a grenade and at least level the playing field.
All in all, so far, I like it. I've only played one terror mission and just unlocked lasers (which are awesome) but it has really decent overall playability, and this is from an old XCOM fan.

Then new enemies got introduced and I could either start over or suffer a long death.

At its surface level, XCOM presents itself as a turn based strategy game where each one of your choices can make or break an entire game play segment. Good choices offer you satisfactory results, and poor choices will result in the death of one or more of your units quite quickly. During the normal difficulty of the game, this cycle allows for a great deal of creative thinking as you tackle the individual missions and progress through the campaign with your fully customised roster of soldiers.

With a vast array of research choices, unit abilities, and map sets, every encounter feels almost unique. The satisfaction of taking a mission on and seeing the fruits of your strategy come to fruition makes this a wonderful pick for any tactics lover, especially in the early stages of the game where you positioning is crucial to your success.

As you progress through the game, the different enemy types and grand level design in conjunction with your ever-evolving squad of alien hunters is enough to keep any strategy-lover entertained for hours on end. Once you hit the penultimate high point of the game however - a point less than 4 hours in - the difficulty drops severely, and with it, so to will your passionate urge to fashion strategies around a group of enemies with intellectual capabilities comparable to that of a grapefruit. Realistically, once you pass this breaking point, the game becomes a joke for any competent player.

To anyone who garners a great deal of entertainment from a challenge, Normal mode fails to deliver, and the higher difficulties simply lack anything of real substance. Rather than introducing unique improvemens to the A.I. that scale with your progress, or anything at all that would warrant praise, XCOM ramps up difficulty by cranking the influence of RNG to a ridiculous high, and effectively diminishing the player's options down to a very select series of viable strategies. 

All viable strategies for a successful Classic+ play through are quite straight-forward, mind-numbing, and make the game a sluggish mess. As with most games in this genre, once you determine the dominant strategy, the game becomes mundane and uninteresting. For those who fail to discover the viable strategies used to careen through the higher difficulties, all you're going to face is frustration, especially when the game encourages you to try out [b]useless[/b] tactics in its tutorial. Every single interesting mechanic in the game is undermined as the 'difficulty' continues to bloat.

Upon locking in 'classic' or 'impossible' difficulty, every single dice roll is over-zealously bloated to account for the pedestrian AI. If you find a great deal of enjoyment in unlocking a straightforward and mundane puzzle that forces you to play the game at a snail's pace, where your only viable options boil down to 'blitzkrieg' or 'retreat' in almost every situation, then you'll likely enjoy the chaotic, edge-of-seat dice rolls that these difficulties have to offer. Don't be too upset as all of your plans go to waste when a 3% chance at failure effectively destroys your chances of success in a matter of seconds, though.

Ultimately, [b]XCOM: Enemy Unknown[/b] is a fine strategy game that fails to achieve anything remarkable. The insane prominence of RNG takes something that could have been a masterpiece, and dumbs it down to a mind-numbing series of frustrating puzzles that all end up having the exact same solutions.",1608369619,1608369619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A sufficient story that neither gets in the way, nor annoys, gameplay that's intuitive and deep, and gut wrenchingly tense tactical moments create a one-of-a-kind game that all strategy fans must play. The difficulty levels offer different levels of intensity, depending on how you like to experience your games.

Admittedly, the game does have some problems. The fact that aliens always get a chance to move after you spot them makes ambushing difficult. The base management part of the game can come off as shallow if you're used to the old XCom: UFO Defense. 

Something to bear in mind is that the game is difficult to mod, but a dedicated community created Long War. This mod greatly extends the life of the game, but really should only be played after you experience XCom normally once. Also, the game is distinct from XCom 2 and plays totally differently. 

I would recommend this game for tactics fans who haven't experienced this amazing game, or for tactical FPS players who want to lean more heavily into squad management at the expense of the FPS aspect. Strategy game players might have a harder time with it, because the base management part of the game is a little on the shallow side.

The only thing this game does well is the fighting. Everything else is just underdeveloped. 
I truly do not understand how this game earns so much praise.

The story
In short, aliens attack earth and you are in command to defend. 
Hence, you shoot down your first UFO, catch your fist alien, understand it was the wrong alien, so next time you catch the right alien and after a while you've caught them all. Then you assault their base which in turn allows you to build a new facility to detect a very special alien craft that you shoot down at the next best occasion. You assault it and the loot allows you to build once again a new facility, which with all the psionic stuff that you have by now, is the key to the end game boss fight. 
The story line can't get more linear and more boring. There are no deviations, no side quests, no real story is told, actually, you don't even know to what end your doing the council missions like asset recovery or personnell protection. They could have at least spun a story around that, but nah, it'll be fine. 
Once you arrive at the last story line task, namely assaulting the temple ship, and you just don't do it then the game becomes really boring. The aliens never get pissed off and never put up a fight. You never ever have to defend neither your base nor your satellites. Except of winning the rare encounters you are not forced to do anything.

So, what is it that you do in this game?
You manage your single base by spending earned resources and you go out to fight aliens that obviously earns you the resources to spend. The base management comes down to building facilities, taking care of what some shady council wants, managing your soldiers, and managing science and engineering projects. Management takes about 1/5 of the play time and fighting about 4/5.

The fighting
The fighting and the AI are the single thing that do stand out. The AI does not really play stupid. Actually, it understands cover and it tries to play its troopers to their abilities. For instance, when the AI gets the chance it will frontally attack you with mutons, where 2 mutons search for cover and the berserker just rushes towards you to draw your fire. At the same time it tries to flank you with lighter units such as floaters. 
The AI realises when being outgunned and withdraws. 
It will try to kill your weakest trooper first when all of your troopers are spotted. 
To play without casualties you need to observe under what circumstances the AI will attack. It pays off to excessively use the overwatch mechanic and cover, or, ideally, to remain unspotted. It is wise to keep your troopers toghether and focus fire on selected enemies to reduce the number of enemy guns quickly.
While the AI plays well I do criticise other aspects of the fighting system: One, friendly fire only exists for explosive weapons such as rockets or grenades. This is bad if you must kill a mind controlled alien and you're out of explosives. You can't stun a mind controlled alien. The battle does not end if the last alien alive is mind controlled. Why not? Two, we cannot target specific body areas of an enemy and reduce mobility, aim, or anything such. Three, it is unclear what exactly critical hits do. Four, combining all of this it obviously became unnecessary the develop alien research more in-depth as it is not imporant to know where the alien's weaknesses are and yet the game's German scientist lady states at one point how urgent it is to understand the enemy. Without any doubt somebody at the dev studio thought about this, however, it seems the idea never made it further than to being outspoken. Earlier XCOM games did that. Certain aliens could be fought better with incendiary rounds, other better with explosives. There is no such distinction in this XCOM game. Five, when your own or enemy units are injured their fighting abilities remain normal. Why?
I don't know why the game lacks so many features in the fighting system. It is not fine like that! It is not fine because of how strong the imperative is set to fighting in this game!

The managing
I won't go too much into detail of the management of the base in terms of builing facilities or managing resources as this is underdevelopend and boring. Underdeveloped, as there is i.e. no storage required to store all the battlefield loot. 
The one management aspect that requires a bit more attention is the troopers. The trooper progession system consists of two distinct segments. One is health points, will and aim, the second are abilities. As you don't have much influence over the first segment, the second segment is better developed. Both are granted, or, unlocked, with battlefield promotions. Abilities split into aggressive or defensive skills, where always one of each can be unlocked per promotion. An aggressive skill would be 'run and gun' that you can use to finish off an enemy by rushing him, and a defensive would be  'tactical sense' that increases the trooper's defense for every enemy he can see. This is a very good idea that gives you more tactical options. 

Science and engineering
By building labs, a foundry and workshops you get more of the corresponding personnell. The number of employees also depends on how successful where in the world you do missions. The science texts are boring and meaningless. They would be meaningful if they gave a hint on the weaknesses of your enemy. Same goes with engineering. Worst of all, when developing and manufacturing better weapons you cannot look up how good they are until you build one. 
Summarized, the curcial information is missing while a lot of meaningless blah blah fills the text fields.

Conclusion
Although underdeveloped the fighting system nonetheless is good because of two elements. The AI and the aggressive/defensive abilities in the trooper progression system giving you more tactical choices. The rest of the game is heavily underdeveloped, be it the very poor story line, or the poor base management, or the poor science/engineering part. Why on earth did this game even hit the market?",1606923511,1606930665,False,0,0,0.430107533931732178,0,True,False,False

If you're reading this, you've likely already heard about the difficulty of the game, about the intense tactical experience, about the frustration of missed shots due to RNG, and about the general feeling of excitement that the game evokes. So I'll keep it simple: XCOM 2012, while not a flawless game, is still one of the most well-designed strategy games I've ever seen, because it sticks to its core design choices and executes them superbly. It's extremely easy to learn and understand, while inviting ample opportunity for growth through extended play. Even in the endgame, if you get there, with the increased resources that you probably have by then, it never loses its sense of smallness, of this being a small, elite team trying to hold on against a vast and terrifying enemy. From start to finish it allows the tension to ramp up with your own advancements and skills as the enemy is always throwing new things at you. And through aesthetics, bonuses, and story arcs, it always maintains its sense of internationalism, that this is truly a threat to humanity, and that humanity as a whole has to fight back together, or is at least try to [spoiler](indeed, Enemy Within's focus is on exploring what happens when this isn't the case, and how it has to be dealt with)[/spoiler]. The core principles, of being easy to learn while still having depth, of tactical intimacy and constant tension and fear, and of camaraderie, hold throughout and together deliver a fantastic game experience.

Enemy Unknown is still one of the best tactical experiences I've played, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who likes the genre. You'll quickly find that it's worth your time.",1597063421,1606801637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's campaign begins as a global alien invasion begins. Prior to the start of the game, a group of countries called the Council of Nations has banded together to create XCOM (short for Extraterrestrial Combat Unit), the most elite military and scientific organization in human history, tasked with defending them from the alien attack. The player assumes the role of the commander of XCOM, and proceeds to engage in a war against an extraterrestrial enemy with overwhelming technological superiority. That's XCOM in nutshell.  Firaxis has deftly blended management, tactics and the sort of gut-level, throaty encounters usually reserved for fast-paced action games. The mixture is potent enough that you may occasionally forget that the most critical moments boil down to nothing more than a percentage and a choice. On any other day, betting on a 60 percent chance might seem like a no-brainer. When the fate of the world hangs in the balance, you'd better think twice.

I will freely admit that I have little to no experience with classic X-COM, and so I cannot speak for the old-time fans of the property. However, the 2012 reboot is certainly a legendary game in its own right. 

As the commander of the eXtraterrastrial COMbat unit, or XCOM; you are tasked with defending the planet Earth against a full-on alien invasion. The game starts you off with a team of four rookies, clad in kevlar vests (which might as well be tissue paper as far as the aliens are concerned), and armed with puny assault rifles. Meanwhile, the aliens are packing plasma-pistol armed Sectoids, and will gradually deploy more deadly units as the game progresses. 

You won't be beaten back so easily, however, and as soon as you get the ball rolling; your troops will be equipped with increasingly more advanced weapons and technology. The game forces you into a desperate arms race, one which keeps you on the edge of your toes, and never hesitates to stomp on those toes if you get cocky. You will find yourself becoming attached to certain troops, and the joy of customising and personalising your squad is one of the best parts of the experience. 

As far as gameplay goes, XCOM: EU and the expansion Enemy Within feature some of the most streamlined and enjoyable gameplay of the strategy genre. Each troop has two action points that they can use to move, shoot, and perform certain actions. Your squad has infinite ammunition reserves, but will have to reload their weapons when they run dry. You and the alien AI take turns moving your troops, and the AI never felt stupid throughout my playthroughs. There were a few times that the melee AI for the Chryssalids and Muton Beserkers fucked up in certain situations, but I found those situations few and far between. 

Story is by far the weakest part of the game, although it's still carried by stellar voice acting, likeable characters, and is really only dolled out in snippets anyway; meaning that you're free to derive your own conclusions from certain events during the story. However, I do feel that certain bits and pieces (such as the motivation of the aliens) were rather weakly laid out and established, and were not adequately explained in both this game as well as the sequel, XCOM 2. 

In terms of more technical parts, the game runs decently on both Mac and PC; although it suffers performance issues and long wait times during some moments in the game. The score is amazing, although it is overshadowed by many other games. Graphics and textures are decent, but are dated by 2020 standards. Level design is nothing to write home about, but is at least navigable and looks good. There are a lot of bugs relating to clipping, a few issues with physics, and some occasional C2Ds after long periods of gameplay (at least on MacOS), but most of these won't disrupt the flow of your game. 

In any case, I wholeheartedly recommend XCOM: Enemy Unknown, as well as the expansion XCOM: Enemy Within. Taking the best lessons from the strategy genre, and adding in a healthy dose of challenging gameplay, high-tension combat, and streamlined mechanics; this game is certainly one you won't regret purchasing at full price.",1605056444,1605056444,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I never had the chance to delve too deep into the original game so I cannot directly compare the two, but it seems Firaxis had huge shoes to fill and giant expectations to meet. Fortunately, I can say that they suceeded and XCOM is one of the best strategy/tactics game around.

Split into two main sections, the game pits you agains a global alien invasion. Taking the role of the military organizarion known as XCOM, you control a squad of soldiers with various roles and abilities, in classic turn based combat, traversing or taking cover in a variety of maps, investigating UFO crash landings, abducttion sites  or saving helpless citizens from the alien threat. 
Where things get really interesting is during the second portion of the game, where you have to  manage your base with actiuons such as: maintain world stability by launching satelites, researching new weapons, performing alien autopsies, expanding your defenses or the base itself with new research rooms etc. All while you struggle to maintain low costs, gain funding, use the available energy you have and all kinds of different management options that give an extra depth to your strategy more than having to simply rely on training your soldiers and fight random battles.

Graphics and sound serve the game well, while nothing mindblowing, the various cinematic camera angles during the battles give an additional layer of excitement to the already tough battles (the game can be pretty tough with some questionable accuracy issues! but there is plenty of difficulty options to choose from, from casual up to true hardcore stuff!) all while you hear some tense ""Michael-Bay-ish"" music whether you run through devris, or discussing your next step with your fellow scientists in the underground HQ as you look through the red zones on the world map.
The presentation is top notch.

If I have one and only one big gripe with  this game, that would be the actual story of it. It can get a bit repeptitive and is definitely as bland and generic as it can get, with the only characters having any sample of persoality are the three main colleagues you see on cutscenes (The base Commander, and the two main scientists). However i can understand that a deep story and characterization is not what this game aims for so I cannot fully blame it for my own personal preferences. With the way thegame works regarding your squad, obtaining nad training new solldiers, it was never the intention to add any depth on them, however sometimes I admit i wish they had soemthing to carry on the majority of the game, as the more I progressed I started getting the feeling that I was playing a collection of well designed but random tactical missions that a coherent central plot. 
That isn't to say there isn't one, and some pivotal plot points do happen throughout, but contrary to the deeper personal dramas and political machinations you see inother similar game sof the genre,  the main focus of the game is to deliver top notch strategy and resource management, and it passes with flying colors. 

I only encountered one bug throughout the game, that unfortunately it could lead to some major problems (one of my squad refused to move forward in the map and I could not get her moving) but apart from that mishap (that fortunately didn't stop me from finishing the stage!), the game had a stellar performance. Kudos for making it playable with both a traditional keyboard+mouse, and a gamepad (the game can be addictive, so being able to rest the wrist during long play hours did wonders!)

A DLC expansion called Enemy Within adds lots of extra fluff, like new missions and upgrades, and although from what I hear it' s not as different from the base game, extra additions are always welcome.

XCOM definitely succeeds in reviving and old classic and bringing it into the modern era, and I highly reccomend it for fans of the genre.",1602613720,1602614290,True,3,0,0.557144045829772949,0,True,False,False

   Typically to Firaxis, the game is a bit ""gamey"" (unnatural  mechanics thrown in for the sake of complexity or because they couldn't do it better). For example you have 2 actions in place of the old Action Points system, only one base, and a pretty limited squad (both in number and items). I guess it's pretty hard to make a game balanced and not (too) gamey.

 Pros: big improvement(s) over the old ones.
 Cons: gamey , only one base, pretty limited squad
 Rating: one sticky alien that likes getting prodded.

If you are someone that was disappointed in Civ V and Skyrim for 'streamlining' the game, and enjoyed the original X-Com, you will be extremely disappointed in X-Com Enemy Unknown. You might even hate it, because it goes much much further than those two titles in 'streamlining' X-Com. 

It has a class system. Each class can't be chosen by you directly, though can be manipulated by what a 'rookie' soldier does in combat (IE running up to an enemy and shooting them point blank gets Assault, shooting them from far away gets Sniper, etc.)

Once your soldier has a class you can't reassign it and their weapon type is locked. What's that? You want them to start using an assault rifle again like they did when they were rookies? Sorry, Assault uses shotguns only now, Snipers can only use sniper rifles, Heavies can only use heavy machine guns and forget about giving them a pistol as a side arm it has to be a fucking bazooka now. You are too dumb, foolish player, to make that sort of call yourself. Your agency doesn't matter. 

Hey remember when you could put your base anywhere on the planet? No sorry that was too much choice, you can only put it in the middle of the United States, in western Brazil, in Eastern Europe, in the Congo, or in the middle of China now. Still too dumb, ignorant player. What difference does it make anyway, that is all the major continents right? Who cares if you are a weeb and want your base in Japan, or a proud Frenchman and want it in France. That is too much choice- and over such a silly thing. 

Hey, remember when you could build more bases in the original? You can't here, just assign satellites over more countries and interceptors to shoot down alien craft there. You don't get an additional transport and soldiers stationed elsewhere to react to problems closer to them. But hey, it isn't like the game makes you do something crazy like choose which country you are going to bail out where such a thing might be useful and logical. Except it does. Semi-frequently in fact. And the countries that you don't help get angry with you. 

There's more than this, more little annoying things that make this game feel like a step backwards in comparison to the original. No, Skyrim and Civ V felt like steps backwards. This one feels more like someone shoved you backwards down a flight of stairs. 

More things to slap you in the face and remind you as someone that likes doing things like that are no longer the norm and complexity is something your niche heart no longer requires because it might confuse someone. I won't lie, the original could have used a lot of streamlining- ACTUAL streamlining, a more intuitive UI and base operation for starters. 

Even there it kind of fails. Some of it is much cleaner, but actually trying to fire a rocket or throw a grenade sometimes has the mouse jumping all over the place and you have to try multiple times. If you lose your patience (I did two or three times) you might end up blowing up the wrong thing, wasting your turn, your ammo, and maybe killing someone you shouldn't have. Ironman mode is available but I would recommend against using it for this reason unless you are okay with 'freak accidents'. 

I do like myself some character customization and while you can't decide their class, stats, or weapon loadout you can pick their race, hair styles, a few faces, and armor colors. No swapping genders or heights or builds though, so it hardly goes far enough in that regard to make this at all that much of a positive. 

This isn't even getting into the story, with characters that will randomly start naval gazing over the most insipid and banal of subjects. ""Y 4 aliens do this 2 us???"" is something you are going to hear CONSTANTLY. So I dunno, maybe if you are one of those hipsters that die on the hill of gameplay being secondary to story because 'videogames are art! politics are inseparable from art!' you'll hate this one too.

Go play the first one, despite its ages and dated graphics it is one of the best turn based strategy games ever made, though it can get a little monotonous. But so can this one, so whoopty shit.",1602339283,1602339283,False,3,3,0.488524317741394043,0,True,False,False

The story is moderately entertaining, but it's really the micromanagement that makes this game shine. You'll find yourself saving often, because small decisions can have big impacts. Outside of battle, should you have prioritized building the facility you did instead of the other one? Maybe you could have benefited more from researching a different technology, or selecting a different perk for one of your units. And in battle, a simple impatient move can result in casualties. Which unlike a lot of games, the little nicknames(which you can change if you don't like) and perks your units receive as they level up makes you grow attached to them, to where losing a single unit in a battle makes you want to reload your last save file and deny it ever happened.

That daunting proposition is at the heart of XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Players manage the paramilitary XCOM project, deciding what new projects to research and what new technology to produce so that the XCOM troopers go into battle with the best equipment possible. Do well and the funding nations will pour even more money into the XCOM project. Do poorly and the nations will pull out, leaving the project with even fewer resources to fight back the alien invasion.
The absolute best aspect of XCOM is the sense that there’s never enough time or resources to do everything that needs to be done. Do you pull a trooper off of active duty to undergo psionic training or do you keep him out in the field where he can get better at his core skills? Do you spend your budget producing satellites to help locate UFOs or do you spend that same money producing interceptors to be sure you can shoot down the few UFOs you do locate? Every moment of XCOM is defined by these either/or decisions where every move involves some sort of sacrifice or compromise. When you combine that with the overall tone of the game, which emphasizes a DEFCON style countdown to a complete alien takeover, the whole experience is fantastically tense and engaging.

To clarify I finished XCom 2 a few times and did so with some finesse in repeat playthroughs, so I knew the basic tactics at least going into playing XCom.
I'm liking the management side; planning, prioritising research and building facilities much like XCom 2.
Combat mechanics:
I knew from XCom 2 that the rookies and squaddies wouldn't be able to hit a barn door when stood inside a barn constructed from barn doors, but this is ridiculous.
I reached the stage where I was to assault the alien base but the hit chance of soldiers up to the rank of Captain was still really poor, as in 65% at best.
Unless the aliens run directly into their sights the snipers are nearly useless, their pistols when used once they've relocated to get a clear shot are pathetically weak, and that's if they hit their target at all.
The heavies have the same problem, they can't use their rocket launchers unless the aliens decide to cluster in front of them around a car, but at least if they have the holotargeting skill the aliens they likely miss with their LMG are a little easier for their squadmates to hit.
At the time where I had a squad of 5 and the opposition were exclusively mutons, 8 at once but I hadn't advanced far enough to trigger the arrival of so many, and Mutons with plasma grenades when your squad's cover is almost entirely cars has likely only one outcome...
At this stage it's not a game of skill and tactics, but of sheer dumb luck that the aliens miss and your soldiers don't especially when the hit chance is low even when flanking the enemy.
It means a lot of reloaded turns and going back to the last Geoscape save because a mission with absurd odds doesn't have an autosave to roll back to on mission commencement where all moves don't lead to the death of half the squad.
The combat system means I don't feel I can progress through skill as easily as with XCom 2.
However since I'm too stubborn to give in I pushed on and levelled up Colonels of various classes and in doing so improved their aim, but the key I found was being able to make it through a couple of months and use the reward funds to improve the armour so 1 or 2 shot deaths were less common.
Once PSI operatives were found amongst the squad the risk of being killed by an enemy at the point of death almost evaporated.

In summary, the combat mechanics are not as varied as XCom 2 (but how else would the sequel have been made as it was?) so that and the distinctly lower hit chance makes this very challenging, so I recommend this for those who are looking for a strategic challenge.

A simple but engaging premise that is used to great effect in the gameplay, with different alien types having different abilities and strengths and your soldiers being able to capture and utilize the more advance alien technology to develop better weapons for your operatives. The game can be quite difficult at times and unforgiving as the aliens will often outnumber and outmaneuver your soldiers. One of the hardest parts of the game is seeing one of your soldiers go from a green recruit to a hardened badass only to die in a harsh battle, the death of your XCOM soldiers is permanent and helps give you a feeling of personal stakes in each engagement.

Edit after more hours in the game:

- It's not a fully polished game, or realistic.
- It's not a complex strategy game, either, but still somewhat difficult.
- Graphics sometimes make it difficult to move units.
- Trying to toss a grenade starts a see-saw of haphazard camera movement.
- Units sometimes miss near point-blank shots, or hit through obstacles, ie. the combat is unrealistic.
- Some of the cut scenes get repetitive and the combat needs a quick mode.

This is a great strategy game and I usually hate strategy games as I am not really good at them. It has a style of its own where each troop has its own action timer to make their move and get closer or further from enemies to better position themselves for attacking.

The troops can be personalized and after a few missions you will grow attached to a few of them, then watch them get blown to pieces making you reload your save to save them. I played this one saving quite a lot...

One of the main things everyone mentions about the game is how hard/frustrating it can be because the calculations for a success hit are not really accurate and you can end up missing a vital hit that you needed that had 95% chance of hitting... but its also part of what makes the game fun and unpredictable.


I completed the whole campaign on regular difficulty then again on classic difficulty, and that was challenge enough, normal mode was fun and let me learn the game, classic had the right amount of difficulty and frustration (with quite a few rage moments) but there is also ironman mode (no saves, just seems impossible for me) and even a higher impossible difficulty. Be sure to select one that matches your appetite for difficulty because higher difficulties can get incredibly frustrating and unfair if you are not super careful and strategic with your approach... and even so you can get really unlucky  and end up getting whipped by RNGesus.",1599231070,1599231199,True,4,0,0.583281278610229492,0,True,False,False

Not for the faint of heart or the casual gamer; this game really requires you pay attention to your moves, learn your enemies and the maps, expect the unexpected (and the obnoxious), and possibly have to save-scum a few levels.

Xcom has the great fortune of having a very dedicated list of Mod devs who can keep the game going after you beat vanilla. In my opinion, a good idea would be to learn how to adjust game code, then go change the game to your preference. In my recent Long War playthrough, I ended up adjusting soldier health and will to scale up better for late game scenarios.

XCOM is a great game of strategy with a lot of luck in it, but I love that about it. 
Sometimes you set everything up perfectly and things go wrong. 
Sometimes you make a horrible mistake and somehow things still work out. 
Why? Because luck is a factor in the game. 
But luck is not what defines the game. 
If you play the game right and persist in learning about tactics, and always ensure to have at least 6 backup plans in case that 90% chance shot misses for the 5th time in a row, then you should be fine. 
In the long run, you will lose soldiers. Sometimes, it will be due to things that are completely out of your control and not your fault. But at the same time, that is all part of the fun. After all, if you played perfectly and there was never any risk of losing, could you even really call that a game? The whole reason why there is a mental stress about which decision should be made is exactly because you don't know what the outcome will be. Should I take the risk? Should I play it safe? In XCOM, sometimes even playing it safe will lead to risks. If you don't kill the enemies and let hide under cover while they shoot at you over and over, you will eventually get hit and lose. You gotto put your men forward, sometimes putting them at risk, if you want to achieve any results. 

Anyways, I love the game. It's a whole lot of fun to build up a strong roster of people and defeat stronger and stronger aliens, even though it can be frustrating at times when you lose someone who you put so much effort into.

With a superb tonal presentation and ease of accessibility, the turn-based gameplay loop proves to be addictively entertaining. The modular nature of the game also allows for beginners to enjoy themselves, while strategy game veterans can enjoy the brutal, harder difficulties. While the game can go on for too long to some, it will keep players coming back for more throughout.

While story isn't of particular consequence in this title (aliens invade; you command a military squad to repel them and maintain order on Earth), tone is everything. The game functionally plays out like an arms race, demanding that your military team keep up with the ever-dominating, increasingly more dangerous alien menace. In this way, the game proves to have a flavor of horror to it, which creates an especially immersive experience.

Many gameplay ideas are derived from classic alien invasion tropes. Players may gun down aliens, capture and interrogate them, dissect their corpses, and shoot down their ships (some of which are designed with the classic flying saucer blueprint). The gameplay itself is divided into two formats; the first, and most prominent, is the turn-based combat, where players will command a squad of 4 to 6 soldiers with varying skills/abilities to eliminate small groups/regiments of hostile alien forces. The second is base management, where players will maintain the facility which houses the titular international military operation, repel alien spacecrafts, and respond to various events which occur around the world. This aspect of the game proves to be less immersive, but adds variety overall.

The only major issue of the game can be the lengthy playtime for a single playthrough, which can take anywhere from 15 to 30 hours, depending on player skill and priorities. This can prove to be a tad long due to the repetitive nature of the game after some time. This is especially felt by some enemies that appear in the latter half of the campaign who have inexplicably higher defense values. As such, many players may find themselves wanting to start a new playthrough more often than reaching their current playthrough's endgame.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown (And by extension Enemy Within) has proven to be hugely influential to turn-based video games, setting the standard for squad-based combat. Its rewarding and intuitive gameplay loop has caused players and critics alike to compare countless other titles with similar combat to be described as ""Like XCOM, but..."" It has its shortcomings, but its influence and quality can't be ignored.",1595988079,1595988079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After putting another 60 hours into it and completing the campaign on impossible difficulty for the first time, I have to say that this game is great. And that's despite minor UI bugs and occasional corrupted saves. I have played this game in October 2012, July 2014, September 2015 and July 2020, each time completing the whole campaign. The number of choices is pretty large with all the expansion packs - 4 basic soldier classes, each of which can be PSI and augmented; you can convert your soldiers into powerful MECHs or build unmanned firing platforms to deploy instead of soldiers.

After completing the game you unlock Second Wave options, which allow to for example randomise the skills between classes - no two snipers will have the same skills available anymore. Or soldiers can have different mobility and be able to move between 7 and 9 tiles. All of this makes finding best soldiers very interesting.

[h1] Original review[/h1]

[list]
[*] low choice of weapons' types (conventional, laser, plasma)
[*] infinite ammo for primary weapon
[*] infinite mag in pistols
[*] no equipment management: armor does not define how much equipment soldier can take, every soldier has primary weapon (shotgun/assault rifle/machine gun/sniper rifle), secondary weapon (pistol/rocket launcher) and 1 utility slot for grenade or passive buff (2 slots after research)
[*] soldiers get extra equipment via skills, e.g. smoke grenades, extra rocket for the launcher or a utility slot holding 3 grenades instead of 1
[*] majority of story line missions are always the same every game
[*] small choice of maps
[*] panic management:
[list]
[*] if at the end of month panic in the country is at maximum, the country withdraws from the XCOM project
[*] deploying a satellite over the country reduces the panic so you have to wait until end of month to decide where to deploy satellites
[*] you have to calculate what and when to build to deploy satellites every month: excavate, build power plant, build satellite uplink, build workshop (building satellite requires certain amount of engineers that workshop provides), build a satellite, deploy it - each of the steps requires time and being late by one day can cause countries to withdraw from the project (loss of funding and continental bonus)
[*] one of the common events forces you to choose 1 out of 3 countries to help - in the 2 other countries (and whole continents) the panic will raise
[/list]
[*] no economy - you cannot build and sell equipment like in original [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/7760]X-COM: UFO Defense[/url] from 1994
[*] strategic map pretty much doesn't exist:
[list]
[*] a single base only
[*] intercepting UFOs is always 1v1 fight
[*] only two interceptor types available, both can equip a single weapon (of course infinite ammo)
[*] only one transport aircraft
[*] distance and travel time do not matter - your aircraft will always reach the object in time and no new event will occur when it's flying
[*] aircrafts don't have fuel
[*] the only way to detect UFOs is satellites, there is no such things like sending aircraft for patrol
[*] no enemy bases (except one unique story line mission)
[*] no base defense (except one unique story line mission where failure equals game over)
[/list]
[/list]

Despite all of these disadvantages, game is quite addicting. The story line is interesting. Building a base and promoting/equiping soldiers is somehow enjoyable. The missions are more dynamic than in original UFO due to 6 soldiers limit and 2 action points per soldier - there is no spending an hour on looking for a single alien that got stuck somewhere, enemies are rather easy to find on the map.

Very clear and responsive interface, you can issue the order and go to the next soldier while the previous one is still moving.",1440775998,1595085693,True,1,0,0.486227512359619141,0,True,False,False

Probably the most notable one is that I can't build two Skyrangers, and respond to two events at the same time -- I could accumulate enough people to crew them, so that always felt very arbitrary, designed to force you to lose some measure of support through an artificial mechanic. 

The shooting mechanics and combat in the original were more adaptive, too, where you could deliberately shoot away sections of terrain, or accidentally shoot your own team-mates if you picked a bad shot (or, if you were awful but lucky, miss one alien and hit another one). The pure strategy of the original game was probably its biggest strength.

However, one of the mistakes I first made with this XCOM was to *not* realise that it wasn't trying to emulate that original game's combat. Despite its similarities and obvious inspirations, this game is doing its own thing -- it's a cover-based squad strategy game, rather than a semi open map one, and that decision makes for some very interesting changes to combat, where you can position your whole squad to set up an ambush that will be triggered when the aliens try to run to cover after your opening attack, for example, which is something that works better here than it ever did in the original. Once you're used to it, you realise that this XCOM isn't better or worse than that 90s one, it's just something different.

The research process is fun, too, but it's the story of this XCOM that is the most notably superior to its ancestor. That's to be expected, of course -- games had less room to work with back then, and so story often took a back-seat to raw gameplay. But those story-driven elements also mean you also get some combat objectives that are more varied than those in the original, which can help to mix things up, and make this game, if not more engrossing, then perhaps more involving than the 90s version. 

It's easy to highly recommend this game -- I still prefer it to its sequel, and overall, despite my nostalgia, I may even like it a little better than that 90s classic. That being said, I'd definitely recommend that people should pick up both versions (and install the OpenXCom extension for the original, to let you add a few pleasant mods to make the old game a better modern experience) and give them a whirl.",1594879860,1594887532,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, let's start from the beginning. XCOM is a game based on tactical, turn-based battles - we command a squad of soldiers to kill UFOs attacking our planet. Combat system is done well - each soldier, depending on class, has his individual set of skills which evolves when he gains new rank. There are heavy units specialized in brutal attacks, long-ranged snipers or helpful supports. Combat heavily depends on taking cover - without it, soldier will almost surely die or, at least, take heavy damage. Thus, we are forced to think before every step - even a simple mistake may mean death to our soldier, because the game heavily punished for these mistakes.

But XCOM is not only about tactical battles - in addition, we have to manage our base to make our squad more efficient in fight. We can research new technologies to upgrade weapons and armor, we can hire new soldiers, we manage aircrafts that interrupt UFOs attacks. Our moves are observe by the conucil - a set of countries that pay us for our work. Whenever country is not satisfied (e.g. we ignore alien abductions in this country), it leaves the council, and this may impact our resources. In addition, base management is definitely not trivial - it's extremly easy to screw something up, this part of the game is as important as raw combat.

Both combat and base management are kinda good, so... what's wrong? Well - problems are in the game flow. At some point, difficulty level rapidly increases - from kinda easy battles it suddenly goes to nearly impossible ones. This could be acceptable if difficulty was fair, but... well, it's not. By ""unfair difficulty"", I mean situation when map is nearly impossible to beat without knowledge of all enemy unit's positions. Aliens move in groups and if we do even one bad step, a whole group joins a battle. This is especially annoying when aliens group is found by soldier whose turn is the last one. Whenever it happeened, I was forced to load the last save and use newly gained knowledge to prepare another tactic.

From some point, this permanent and unavoidable save and load tactic just becomes frustrating. In addition, being forced to use an extremly defensive tactic makes battles too long. After more or less tries, I was capable of winning almost every combat - but after each one, I was rather exhausted than happy. In addition, at some point I had to win many hard fights one after another. That's why I had to take a long break and I have not finished the game yet.

I think I'll finish it earlier or later - XCOM is not that bad at all and I still want to know how the story will end. But the game flow is something that definitely needs polishing. And I played on normal difficulty - I tried on harder one first, but if it's your first time with this game, don't try it.",1594761845,1594761845,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

XCOM: Enemy Unknown is the best squad-based, tactical turn-based shooter I've had the pleasure of playing. It simultaneously scratches that Aliens and Final Fantasy Tactics itch in a single, masterful stroke. I also wholeheartedly recommend buying its expansion, XCOM: Enemy Within as it adds a level of variety I wouldn't play without.

5 Pros:
- Engaging tactical and challenging strategic gameplay.
- Stylish graphics and animations.
- Plenty of squad & base customisation options.
- A menacing and often tense experience. (Especially in Iron Man mode; permanent death is terrifying.)
- Great replayability. (Campaign options, maps, squad loadouts, difficulty settings & second wave game mechanic settings.)

5 Cons:
- Some graphical bugs.
- Lacks multiplayer options (PvP is an afterthought and there is no Co-op mode).
- The difficulty reduces significantly towards the campaign's end.
- You cannot alter a recruits gender or country of origin.

First a Pros and Cons list:-


[u]Pros:-[/u]


-Amazing Atmosphere (soundtrack especially captures the tension/epicness of the story)
-Deep Progression (EW and Long War add a ton of choices for progression)
-Amazing Replayability (again, EW and Long War adds a ton of replayability)
-Easy to pick & play (mission time can vary from 20 minutes to an hour)



[u]Cons:-[/u]


-RNG heavy (this con is mitigated with Long War)



[u]Overall rating: 7/10 (8/10 with EW and 10/10 with LW)[/u]


Xcom is a combination of turn-based-strategy and meta strategy wrapped into a single package. The base game takes about 20-30 hours for a single play-through with varying difficulties for replayability. The expansion adds another 5-10 hours along with various extra toys to play with. The icing on the cake is the Long War mod. The mod completely overhauls the game by adding more classes, more items, diverse enemy variety, etc for tons of replay-ability.

My only critique of the game is the chance to hit system making it RNG heavy. Long War addresses this to an extent by improving your options to disable aliens while you close in for better shots.

Also keep in mind that this is coming from a plebian whose only experience with turn-based strategies are SM's Civilization, Fire Emblem, and games with attack-based battles, such as Pokemon and Persona. 

This game is everything I've been yearning for from within my heart. Multiple difficulties to allow you to find the perfect balance of luck and strategy. I love nothing more than to be punished for my own stupidity. Good old Operation Crimson Daze, where I thought I'd use the medium class UFO crash as an opportunity to train 3 new squaddies alongside my most experienced soldier, my dedicated medic, as well as Giorno Giovanna, a man with a 4 missions to 1 kill ratio.   Missions/combat are exhilarating. I'd often find myself clenching my fists in addition to my ass with each new encounter, praying to a god that Giovanna, my beautiful, beautiful, useless fucking sniper clad in pink armor, could hit something for once. Needless to say, he didn't. Everyone except William Williams, the medic, was either dead or down within two turns, at the hand of that godforsaken weird flying disc alien. One dash away from the extraction zone, it is with regret that I say, Cpl. Williams took some plasma to the knee, and died, thus marking the first time I had failed so miserably as a human being with a functioning brain.

Story is linear, but not necessarily bad. I usually skip cutscenes after 5 seconds because I can guess what they're talking about. Base management, panic management, and fund management are all great features to the game, allowing you the freedom to make choices outside of battle that have consequences. 

tldr: great combat, good out-of-combat management stuff, ok story.

As I retire, I surrender all my responsibilities to you. From this point on, you will take charge. You will lead the troops on the battlefield. You will repel the alien invasion and bring peace and prosperity back to Earth. 

Remember, mistakes are unforgiving. Percentages are merciless. There are no such things as apologizing, trying over or hoping for a miracle. If you do not use all your leadership capabilities, you are doomed. If you fail at strategic or tactical planning, you die.

- Troop deployments
Finding the right balance between experienced troops and less experienced troops can be difficult. You don't want to just send out your rookies for each mission because they'll just get cut down, but you also can't rely on a single group of experienced troops to carry you throughout the game

- Research
Where will the tech tree lead you? Hell if I know!

- Facility Building
You need to decide how to allocate the limited space you have in your bunker. Do you use that free square for a new lab to speed up your research team? Or maybe you decide to build a psi lab to see if any of your troops have latent psychic ability? Or maybe you just need more cash and opt instead of a satellite array. Finding a winning combo of facilities can be difficult.

- Supply Lines
You get supplies from two primary sources - nations/regions donating to XCOM, and satellites. Satellites arrays are cash, but as I mentioned before, it can be daunting deciding if a sat array is really more important than any of the other facilities you can build.

- Panic Level
Each participating XCOM nation/region has it's own panic level, and if it gets too high, they're gone. You lose the valuable supplies they provided you, and there are occasions where you'll have to decide between damning one nation or another.

I'm sure there are a lot of players who didn't struggle with all of these points, and I'm stoked you were able to hop in so quickly. But for me at least, it took a fair amount of save scumming, campaign restarts, and reading guides before I felt like I was starting to understand how to manage all these mechanics.

Incredible strategic depth, butt-clenching encounters, and plenty of difficulty options to tailor the game for the challenge you seek. I still alternate between Enemy Within and WOTC. It might be older, but it still plays well and has it's own vibe. Now that I have the series on Steam I'll likely play more for years to come. Oh, and that OST by Micheal McCann is GOD TIER.

A more petty gripe, you can't open the main menu in combat unless it's your turn. So if you do want to reload, or just adjust the interface or something, you may have to watch all of the enemies take their turns first. Big deal in later levels when there's 20 enemies. The interface is pretty terrible overall. Aiming frags and rockets is entirely obnoxious. By default the order of your characters turns is almost the opposite of what it should be.

- Customization of characters and building squads
- Very careful thinking on your turn. It's like playing chess, but much more complex
- The developers really put efforts on the main DLC and the price is totally fair. I highly recommend playing with Enemy Within
- Story is really nice, you defend Earth from Aliens. It shows humanity learning from the enemy and stealing their technologies, so we have a chance against them. It also has some deep concept about aliens and why would they attack Earth, it's very interesting
- Very difficult, almost all missions are not perfect. Some soldiers may get wounded or even die

Some of the things that I don't enjoy much:

- the RNG sometimes is a bit frustrating. It's like 98% aim and you miss the shot, while the enemy do some crazy shot and hit with an unbelievable critical strike
- you have to play safe constantly. Sometimes while in a fight, one more step forward and you just rushed, causing more enemies to spawn and now you have too many enemies to handle at the time

The voice actors with different languages feel definitely nice.

THERE ARE HALF A DOZEN THIN MEN WHO WILL COME AT YOU ALL AT ONCE, ALL OF WHICH WILL CRIT APPROXIMATELY EVERY SHOT EVEN IF YOU ARE A MILE AWAY IN FULL COVER. ENJOY! 

a game can't both treat troops as expendable, useless drones and then not give the player enough of said troops that a single casualty screws the whole mission, especially when the tactical situation boils down to ""lol cover who will RNGesus love more today oh not you never you but bless you my slithery children have some crits."" maybe if you save scum long enough for a few soldiers to live to develop abilities beyond USELESS SMOKE GRENADE and HEADSHOT THAT DOES MORE DAMAGE OH BUT YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY HIT ANYTHING EVEN WITH A S.C.O.P.E.

good on firaxis for learning their lessons for XCOM 2, but this game is hot garbage by modern standards.

edit: having save-scummed to get those additional abilities, the game does in fact become fun once you have decent units. which ironically enough underscores why i can't recommend it as opposed to XCOM 2. there's a reason sharpshooters start with squadsight in that game, and why rangers don't get run and gun and rapid fire until much higher ranks. this game quickly becomes the assault show, wherein the most effective tactic is to just rush everything down with constant rapid fire barrages (plus some close and personal of course). meanwhile, your snipers are useless until corporal rank, which takes forever to reach because they can't kill anything reliably until they get squadsight without exposing themselves to at least one turn of being murdered, your supports are stuck jacking it in a smoke cloud and your heavies get to join the supports in the circle jerk after they fire their rockets since they can't hit anything with their LMGs and can't crit even if they do. sigh. for all that xcom 2/wotc may have gone too far with hero units at least basic units are sufficiently competent at their tasks in that game to be useful. if you can sit through several hours of getting screwed you can find a good game here. or you can just buy xcom 2 and get a good game to start with",1593287800,1593459531,False,1,1,0.425087094306945801,1,True,False,False

There are lots of comments surrounding X-COM's difficulty, so you should be aware of this before diving in. It's incredibly hard, and it's not in a Dark Souls kind of way, where you feel as though it was ""fair"", and that if you merely up your skill in the game, it won't happen again. That's not X-COM's difficulty. X-COM is hard in an unforgiving, the world is out to get you and you will suffer, kind of way. There are moments where it feels harsh, like you didn't ""deserve"" what you got. There's an expression in the community, ""That's X-COM baby!"" What it means is, you will experience the heartbreak of loss. All that said, I actually feel like it's done quite well in X-COM, and it made the experience more satisfying.

The reason the ""unfair"" difficulty is good, is that you don't just all of a sudden lose the whole game. You'll experience moments of deep loss, where a soldier you've become connected with gets into a tight spot, and ends up dying. You feel like there was nothing you could have done to save them. But you need to move on. The way the game works, you can lose soldiers, and even lose missions, and still be able to continue (albeit, it hurts your chances of survival overall). In fact, it's pretty much impossible to beat the game without ever having had some kind of loss. So it's not like games that create artificial difficulty by just one-shotting you. A unit might get one-shotted, but you still have a chance to pull yourself back together, and struggle forward.

This aspect of the game actually creates a new dimension in the gaming experience; mental fortitude. It's not purely just a ""sit down and have a good time!"" kind of game. You actually have to push forward, overcoming your grief, pick yourself up by your bootstraps, and continue fighting. That's the difficulty of the game.

This game is a turned based Sci-Fi strategy game. It has a bird's eye camera view like Starcraft. 

What I like
- acquiring alien weapons and parts has good synergy with base building
- balanced classes
- good replay value
- interesting DLC adds gene and mech mods to soldiers
- Long War mod

What I don't like
- You lose necessary alien artifacts when you kill aliens with heavy ordnance
- Can't identify which tiles are on overwatch when enemy activates overwatch
- Mimetic Skin is a useless and expensive gene mod

TL; DR: 
XCOM: Enemy Unknown should rather be called ""SAVE SCUM SIMULATOR WITH ALIENS: THE HIT PERCENTAGES ARE A LIE EDITION"" 

First off, the good things:

- Different classes, even though you only get the absolute industry standard: Medic, Sniper, Explosives Guy and A CQB guy.
- Technology that you can research so you get stronger over time.
- You can capture enemies to question them 
- The alien-centered story is somewhat interesting, but don´t expect any Nebula awards
- Some feeling of urgency is generated through panic levels rising
- New enemy types are introduced frequently
- VIsuals and sounds are satisfying, especially the guns, violence or aircraft noises
- Basebuilding is fun
- SHIVs are a fun idea. 

Now let´s get to the awful stuff, and there is a lot in this game: 

- EXTREMELY repetitive missions, because there are like 4 mission types
- Rookie soldiers that are not snipers are complete shit at shooting anything that isn´t 3 metres away. How did they become soldiers in the first place? 
- Enemies are always great shooters and hit almost every time. 
- There should be a gym / sparring room / firing range / simulation chamber building to slowly level your soldiers up while they aren´t away on missions. 
- Ufo plane chases are very boring
- No auto unequip gear button
- Many problems with terrain visibility / seeing enemy line of sight because something is always not displayed properly or is blocking your view
- Why does questioning an enemy not also complete the autopsy since they are dead at the end of the questioning? 
- Money is always highly limited, why am I not drowning in cash as I am the only capable defender against an alien threat? 
- If countries drop out of XCOM, they are gone forever. Even if you maintain low panick for the rest of the game, they will never rejoin you. 
- Cutscenes can´t be skipped
- Enemy will randomly be dropped onto the map, basically falling from the sky. 
- Ethereal enemy type that can deflect all types of projectiles 
- Huge mechs that can shoot twice in a row
- You can only hire rookie soldiers. How about an option where I pay much more than 10 bucks, but get a higher level soldier? 
- Why are there no airstrike options in outdoor maps? That would be the obvious thing since you have fighter jets anyway. 
- Why does no one except the medic have more than one inventory slot? Backpacks are a thing, you know.
The last mission was also pretty bad, you only get to fight all enemy types again and get a totally obvious ending. 
- Why do I have to reload laser weapons and plasma weapons even if the research description states they do not require reloading? 
- Why do some missions not display difficulty?

--> Absolute gamebreakers:
- The game can not handle more than 100 saved games an will lag more and more the mor new save games you create. 
- Steam Cloud saving fucked up and overwrote three hours of progress once. 
- As soon as the turn is finished with 1 guy, the game will zoom away from that soldier even if I wanted to do something with his buddy who stood 3 metres away.
- No smart quick way to swap between soldiers.
- Hit percentages are complete BS. The game might as well not display them: I frequently had 75% shots miss against enemies about as tall as a van. WTF? If I repeatedly reload the game and still fail that 75% shot 6 times in a row, that means that it is predetermined that I will miss and the game doesn´t roll the dice every time, as 75% would indicate. So why bother with the percentages?  Also, how can you miss shots if you are literally poking your gun barrel in an enemies nostrils? (Yes, happened several times) 
- Enemy turns/ Own turns can´t be sped up / be completed instantly. I wasted so many hours of my life watching people shoot aliens in Slo-Mo or evade shots in Slo-Mo or run to cover in Slo-Mo or be struck with plasma in Slo-Mo, WTF? 
- There is no stealth option: As soon as you cross a trigger line / get into enemy FOV, the enemies will instantly activate and will get several move turns and will safely get to cover without you being able to interrupt them doing that unless you have someone in the back on overwatch AND within line of sight. 
- Enemies that you haven´t seen before because of some sort of fog of war will take potshots at your guys while they run for cover. 
- The difficulty is way too hard AND badly balanced most of the time. I am a sucker for hard, but fair games. I completed all Souls games and Bloodborne with relative ease and had a blast: These games are tough, but very rewarding. Sadly, this game is doing a horrible job at balancing the difficulty. The game simply isn´t rewarding enough to suffer through anything more than easy difficulty and not savescum like a MF. 
IF you don´t savescum the hell out of this game, your guys will die like flies, you will fail catastrophically and you will have a very, very frustating time with this game. I was glad when I finally finished it. 

I thought about playing the Long War mod, but the game simply isn´t interesting or enjoyable enough to spend more time on it as far as I am concerned. 
IF I should absolutely play Long War because it is more interesting than the base game or because it adresses some of the  flaws mentioned above, please leave a comment.",1592002424,1592054460,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played at least a dozen campaigns now. I think this title is better than XCOM 2. The alien interrogation, base construction, and story were all more compelling to me in this title. The combat feels similar, and I think it's well worth picking up this title for any turn based tactical combat fanatic. Because of it's age, there are great sales regularly.

I know some people hate the randomness of UFO encounters, the loss of support for XCOM because it's literally not possible to stop threat from increasing around the world, and the rapid scaling of enemies both from difficulty and their tech advances during a campaign, but really, you can manage it. I even enjoy the challenge.

Yes, there is a hero for XCOM that completes a noble sacrifice to save humanity, and no, it isn't you, the Commander. It's some random soldier you train and direct in the field. Someone you have grown to love having on your team because they were a total boss that time they killed that big alien monstrosity. That time they survived that ridiculous ambush. They have been there for you and the mission through months of ceaseless fighting, and they put a stop to it. Your plans got them there, and you will never see their like again.

All in all I recommend this game because it is very entertaining. But there are parts of it that I really, REALLY, dislike.

Yes the game is not always supposed to be fair, and I always play on harder difficulty levels. However there are times when it is just down right ridiculous, listed in order RAGE factor:
1) The Random number generator (RNG). A common problem for RNG implementations is clumping. That is returning a string of numbers in a similar number range. Now the problem with clumping in XCom is that a string of great numbers generally doesnt make much of a difference since taking low probability actions is dumb. Rather than take a 20% shot you are better off hunkering, repositioning, or going to overwatch. However a string of bad numbers makes a big difference. Ive lost count of the number of times every member of my squad has missed on high probability to hit odds, or the enemy hits with numerous successive crits at long range when Ive had full cover.
2) Enemy positioning. Ive loaded into missions and on turn one moved one unit a short distance forward to cover and triggered 10, yes 10, enemies. Complete wipe. No chance.
3) Turn limit missions which cannot possibly be completed because of the distances to travel and the placement of enemies.",1590986307,1590986307,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not quite like XCOM2 though if that's why you're here. The combat is much more laid back, there are no turn limits, it's all in all not nearly as difficult, and has a generally much more cartoony and game-y feel to it but it's still really good.

You star as the Commander, the leader of a military spec ops group whose objective is to protect the planet from unknown threats (thus, Enemy Unknown). Well, that threat has come to bear in the shape of an alien invasion that starts abducting people out of the blue so now you have to upgrade your base and gear and send your merry band of hapless soldiers to be murdered by the enemy.

XCOM. EU is a tactical, turn based strategy game. It can be gruesomely difficult and the random hit chance can and will make you want to tear your hair out in frustration some times but save often, keep calm, and bump the difficulty down if necessary and you will find yourselves with a good game and a good (partly self-created) story in your hands.

On the technical level I sometimes experience a crash but not too often. I think I only crashed twice in all my playtime, including with the expansion Enemy Within. The expansion, by the way, changes the gameplay, but not the story (not much anyway). So if you buy it do not expect new missions. Just new gear/objectives/gameplay. Which is fine.

I recommend this game for fans of the genre but also for newcomers looking to step into the franchise. Just don't be afraid to go for the lower difficulties if needed, this game is difficult.",1589447510,1589447510,True,1,0,0.501846373081207275,0,True,False,False
