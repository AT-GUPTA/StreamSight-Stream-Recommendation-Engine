the set-up in the beginning couple hours of the story ends up being a huge curve ball and i always loved that about it. haytham is my favorite ac character and one of the most interesting characters in gaming (imo). i could sit here and write for hours about him, but you get the point. connor, while yes, bland, i think is perfect the way he is; it's his personality - a rock-solid exterior that he's formed in response to his childhood and forthcoming trials. people just missed the charm of ezio, which is fair, but connor is really a great assassin that is largely overlooked.

i think my biggest gripe with this rerelease is the dropping of steam achievements. i was actually replaying this game to 100% it, and realized that there weren't any achievements for me to get. definitely ruined my night.

but, if you haven't yet, give this game a go. the combat is fluid and super satisfying and the characters and settings are really enjoyable. i would purchase this on xbox/ps for achievements, however, and i'll go a step further in saying you'd be better off playing the original 2012 title for the better atmosphere.",1708757806,1708757806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game changed a lot, all the games that came before it really built on each other and could be seen as one long game, considering how similar they ""felt"". This one is simply different, it really feels like a new game which (at least to me) isn't a good thing in this case. I feel like they took a risk with this one and in my opinion, it payed off:
The combat is really different but in a good way. Many say its too easy but I love it. They added Rifles & Pistols really well, the animations are great, there are different enemy types, different kinds of weapons and much more, I don't really get why they removed the block but other than that I don't see anything bad about the combat, It's great.
The Stealth is weird. It seems to just never work. NPC's spot you very easily & even though there are some stealth tools, it seems as if the most important ones where removed. You really notice that they heavily focused on the combat.
Parkour is alright, i guess. I can't think of anaything thats missing but it's just not as good as the games before.
The Story is really good to be honest. Definitely my favorite out of the Desmond Games. Connor's relationship with his father is really interesting and his hate for Charles Lee is apparent. Because of his father, all of his connections to the Templar felt really personal. It's really a shame that most Assassination Missions for most of them aren't that good.
All in All, the game has amazing combat and a great story but it somewhat lacks in Stealth & Movement / Parkour: 7/10

One problem with this game is that it's the remaster. For some reason, you cannot buy the original which is kind of stupid. While playing this, I could really tell that the game was probably better before getting remastered. The Graphics look a bit odd, seems like all they did was make the faces weird and turn up the brightness & contrast. For what it is, it requires oddly high Graphic Power.

Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered is already included in AC3. It seems a bit like a scam they don't mention that in the  Assassin's Creed Liberation description as warning before buying it.

There are some, generally subtle, differences between the two, although I think  Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered's lighting may be a bit improved and less flat.

The story gets better and better as the game progresses. As I think everyone already knows, you play as Connor's father for the first few hours. It takes a long time, but it's very well integrated. After that, you briefly play as the teenage Connor and then more or less grow up with him. Up to the point where Connor is accepted into the ranks of the Assassins, however, it takes around eight hours. As I said, that's okay though, as it all makes sense in the end and you're left with the feeling of how incredibly weak you seem to be between all the intrigues and the strength of the Templars at the time.

I also enjoyed the so-called homestead missions much more than expected, where you build and colonise more and more houses in a section of the map.
Overall, the map is very beautiful. There are more or less two large map areas, which are in the countryside, and Boston and New York, but they are not as varied as the other two.

I was also told that AC3 runs on the same engine as AC2 and co. However, you don't notice this so much in the game, as the parkour runs much more smoothly in many places. Many sensible improvements have been implemented here compared to its predecessor. 

The most obvious is, of course, the ship driving. It's really fun and is very sensibly embedded in the overall setting.

More or less at the very end, the tragic story of Desmond Miles, who has accompanied us through five games, comes to an end.

All of the little QoL features that they implemented into the base game unfortunately don't outweigh the glaring issues the game and it's DLC as well as AC:LIberation have: bad controls with mouse and keyboard, camera that does whatever the hell it wants, a terrible and I mean TERRIBLE plot for Tyranny of King Washington as well as AC:Liberation and (optional) mission challenges that make you want to rip your hair out because of the godawful controls.

Why are there so many pointless chests in Washington DLC? Why is the story so godawful? Why is it episodic?
Why is the plot of Liberation all over the place and barely coherent making you wonder in the middle of a main mission what exactly the end goal here is? What is it with the pointless collectibles?

Answer to all of the above: incompetent and arrogant projectmanagement that wanted to sh1t out another Assassin's Creed ASAP so number go up this quarter. Pathetic.

My personal ragequit moment in AC LIberation: trying to do the challenge ""not take any damage"" while on one of the last missions with your mentor. The game ignores its own rules here: usually enemies that are immune against specific counters are identifiable because of their looks. Not so in this mission. Have fun GUESSING what this enemy is immune against to beat this challenge. Bad game design, obviously not thought through, just released it with no second thought.

The absolute worst Assassin's Creed game of the entire franchise (see Liberation below). It seems like the developers of this installment went out of their way to painstaking make the most frustratingly finicky game possible. It's like they sat around a campfire on some company wilderness outing (picture that Office episode) devising ways simply to piss off anyone playing the game. And it's easily the most bugged installment of the franchise as well.

Oh, look, there's an NPC. Let's go see what he has to say. Oh, great! Three other NPCs talk over that NPC.

ME: Oh, hey! Look! A rock on the ground. Let's jump over it horsey!
HORSE: Ummm, no thanks. 
ME: How about this log here!
HORSE: Ummm, not really feeling up to it, bud.
ME: What about that nice fence over yonder? 
HORSE: Ummm, come to think about it...I'm not really the jumping type of horse, you know?
ME: It's becoming vastly apparent.
ME: Well, how about walking through this stream?
HORSE: Ummm, that sounds like A LOT of work.
ME: It's pretty shallow. Barely ankle deep. I could EVEN walk through it.
HORSE: Well...you see...I don't really like getting wet.
HORSE: And since you CAN walk through it...
ME: Okay, well, maybe just trotting up this hill over here? It's not really steep?
HORSE: Ummm, I use to do things like that.
ME: But...not anymore I take it?
HORSE: It's an AWFUL lot of work!
ME: Well, how about just running in a straight line without stopping for no apparent reason AT ALL other than to piss me off? 
HORSE: Ummm, well that's kind of my entire point in the game, son, sorry!
ME: What!? To stop running for no apparent reason!?
HORSE: Oh, no! I like running.
HORSE: I run ALL the time!
ME: You do!?
HORSE: Especially when you're not looking.
ME: Hmmm...
HORSE: I'm just programmed to piss you off.
HORSE: Perhaps walking would be easier?
ME: Yep! I think I'll throw away that whistle that's already a pain in the ass to use!
HORSE: Sounds like a plan, chief!
HORSE: How about some oats?
ME: Try the redcoats, tubby.

Whoever designed the tree look out points ought to be...I hope a car runs...falls down a flight of...contracts a flesh-eating...chokes on a...

Oh, cool! I heard about this nifty little sword in the middle of an ancient temple of a lost civilization, so I sailed who knows how long, spent who knows how much money to get here, but I finally found the sword in a sarcophagus. It was surrounded by  a ton of gold coins, probably worth millions of pounds, easily, but me, personally, the sword was the only thing worth taking away after my LONG, LONG trip. Single-minded! That's me! Laser-like focus! Hmmm...come to think of it, I probably could have picked up maybe just TWO of those gold coins and bought a better sword than the one I found. Perhaps in the next installment or even a DLC I'll mysteriously grow a brain, sail back to the temple, and pick up all the gold.

CRAFTING LOL! I've NEVER seen a more pointless crafting system in ANY of the 100+ games I've played. WOW! Don't even spend a minute looking at it, it is absolutely 100% without even a tiny fraction of a infinitesimal sliver of a doubt so utterly pointless as to wonder how could ANYONE, ANYONE AT ALL have been paid to do it!

-----

Since you can't play the Liberation HD without accessing it through Assassin's Creed III in the game library, you can't write a review for Liberation alone, so this next bit is for Liberation.

Assassin's Creed III in general is a terrible game, but Liberation is hands down the worst installment of the franchise. There will be many spoilers in this review, but seriously, read them because you're simply wasting your money by buying this.

First and foremost, this installment doesn't add anything to the main story line. It has nothing to with Desmond or the modern day events whatsoever. They try to tie it in with Connor in one sequence, but it's a ham-handed job that rings completely hollow.

You are not in an Animus, and you aren't reliving an ancestor's memory. It's simply: here's a crappy character we liberals who programmed this game know that you won't connect with or even like, but we want you to play it for no other reason than the fact that we want to inject our identity politics into a game.

The only bit that relates to anything seen in the main story line is that somehow or another the crappy character that you're forced to play may or may not be a descendant of Eve.

This installment feels completely linear as opposed to an open world.

The missions are simplistic, but you'll still have plenty of ""Assassin's Creed III: Restart Last Checkpoint"" for 100% sync.

All of the collectibles are not needed, nor necessary for 100% sync.

The economy of the game can be completely ignored.

They added a persona system into the game so that you play three distinctly different roles that have limitations that simply make the game retarded, and seemingly, the other reason they were added was so that you could play as a slave.

While the remaster addresses some of the shortcomings of the original release, it introduces new elements that enhance the overall experience. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons:

Pros:

Visual Overhaul: The most noticeable improvement in Assassin's Creed III Remastered is the visual upgrade. The remaster boasts enhanced textures, lighting, and character models, breathing new life into the game. The revamped visuals make the historical setting even more immersive, with improved details and realistic environments.

Technical Improvements: Many of the technical glitches and bugs present in the original game have been addressed in the remaster. Players can expect a smoother experience with fewer interruptions, contributing to a more polished and enjoyable gameplay experience.

All Downloadable Content (DLC) Included: Assassin's Creed III Remastered includes all the original game's DLC content, providing players with additional missions and narratives. This comprehensive package adds value for both newcomers and returning fans, offering a more complete and expansive gameplay experience.

Updated Parkour and Combat Mechanics: The remaster takes advantage of advancements in gaming mechanics since the original release. Parkour movements feel more fluid, and the combat system benefits from refinements, providing a more responsive and enjoyable player experience.

Naval Warfare in 4K: The naval warfare, a standout feature in the original game, is even more breathtaking in 4K resolution. The remaster allows players to appreciate the beauty of the open seas and intense naval battles with greater detail and clarity.

Cons:

Limited Innovation: While the remaster improves upon the original, it doesn't introduce groundbreaking innovations. The core gameplay remains largely the same, which may leave some players hoping for more significant updates or additions to the mechanics.

Character Animations: While the character models have seen improvements, some animations may still appear slightly dated. Facial expressions and character movements, while better than the original, may not meet the expectations set by more recent releases.

Repetitive Mission Structure: The remaster inherits the original game's mission structure, which can still feel repetitive at times. Some players may find certain side quests lacking variety, though the inclusion of additional content helps mitigate this issue to some extent.

Stealth Mechanics Unchanged: Similar to the original, the remaster's stealth mechanics remain somewhat basic. Players seeking more nuanced and sophisticated stealth experiences may find the mechanics lacking depth.

Performance on Older Hardware: While the remaster offers an enhanced visual experience, it may struggle to run smoothly on older hardware. Players with less powerful systems may need to compromise on graphics settings to maintain a consistent frame rate.

In summary, Assassin's Creed III Remastered successfully revitalizes the American Revolution adventure with a substantial visual upgrade and technical improvements. While it may not introduce groundbreaking changes, the inclusion of DLC content and refined gameplay mechanics make it a worthwhile experience for both returning fans and those discovering the game for the first time. The remaster strikes a balance between nostalgia and modern gaming expectations, offering an enhanced journey through the pages of history. Yet i still cant recommend this title due to game breaking bugs.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Assassin's Creed III Remastered is a remaster of the original AC III, including all it's DLC and AC Liberation.
In the present day you, once again, follow Desmond Miles in his efforts to stop an impending disaster that could destroy humanity. To do this Desmond must relive the memories of another of his ancestors, Ratonhnhaké:ton/Connor, a Native American driven to join the Assassins in order to protect his people and avenge the burning of his village.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]Combat is probably the best and most brutal of the original games.
[*]Naval combat is great.
[*]Good weapon variety. There are also new weapons like the bow and the rope dart.
[*]Graphics are a huge improvement over Revelations and, for the most part, an improvement over the original.
[*]Good story.
[*]Connor and Haytham's debates about the differing ideals of their factions, which help to shed a new light on both the Assassins and the Templars.
[*]Parkour is an improvement over the previous games. You can now climb trees and rocks.
[*]Homestead missions are great and show another side to Connor's character that the main story doesn't.
[*]Connor's suit is my favourite.
[*]The Tyranny of King Washington is a good DLC, although the map feels empty.
[*]Modern day missions are pretty good.
[*]Fantastic soundtrack.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]Poor optimization. Relugar fps drops in Boston.
[*]Characters' faces look like they're made of wax. A huge step down from the original AC III.
[*]Some of the rock textures in the Homestead area are really bad. The texture's pattern repeats far too often.
[*]Enemy shooting markers don't work properly. I got shot regularly even though the marker wasn't bright red yet. It also doesn't show up at certain angles.
[*]The longest intro out of any AC game.
[*]Poor story pacing. Some important reveals are made off-screen.
[*]Optional objectives. They're a blight in AC games.
[*]Terrible modern day ending that pretty much killed the modern day storyline.
[*]Having to use the tunnels to unlock fast travel stations.
[*]Viewpoints don't reveal the whole map. You have to walk around to fully reveal it. Terrible decision.
[*]Collectibles, though not as many as the other games.
[*]AC Liberation isn't interesting.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Assassin's Creed III Remastered is a decent upgrade over the original, although some things are definitely downgraded, and comes bundled with all it's DLC and AC Liberation.
The game itself isn't perfect but it has a good story, great combat and a fantastic soundtrack that, in my opinion, rivals the Ezio trilogy.",1706751555,1706811185,True,87,0,0.868485331535339355,0,True,False,False

Connor is still the most boring protagonist ever, he has as much personality as a dull knife. While Haytham made some compelling arguments, Connor still decided to go with his indoctrination.

With Connor it's the same as before - Give me Lee or give me death! I have no idea who put this idea in his head that Charles Lee is the worst human being ever, despite his actual father being the head of the American Rite of the Templar Order. 

The change in the graphics is subjective - some things look better and some look much worse for the wear. This is one of those many Assassin's Creed games that are just forgettable.

- Flailing clothes and other fabrics as if there's an ongoing tornado in cutscenes at all times.
- Audio cutting out and ruining some dramatic moments.
- British soldiers firing through walls, and detecting the player through walls.
- They did something to combat and its counter indicators, sometimes they don't show up, they often show up late, not an issue I recall with the original.
- Teleporting british people that seemed to come back and forth from the shadow realm (bonus feature from the ones who respawned seconds after death multiple times, ruining stealth approaches on forts).
- Lighting ruins some scenes being either too dark or too bright, also everyone looks smooth like they're made of playdough.
- General animation glitches and the parkour feels way more finnicky and buggy than the original.

Poorly designed missions, bad or inconsistent event/action triggers, a main character thoroughly lacking in character depth, and a historical story that lacked any of the history of the events in the New World or connection to the greater brotherhood that would have made it more engaging.  The mechanical problems should have been cleaned up with the remaster to bring the game closer to Black Flag, which feels much better in many of the regards that annoyed me with this one.  

The worst mechanic is in the Washington DLC, but thankfully not the main game.  If you get detected in the open world more than a dozen enemies spawn out of thin air around you to attack you.  It is horrible.  Another problem that I had only in the DLC is many enemies were not marked in red on the minimap.  The mission design in the DLC is also much worse.  It is baffling that this was released twice is such a bad state.  

The stories in this time period would have been better suited for the post-Origins style of games, as well as with a better main character.  Or even the same main character with a bit more personality and better writing.

After a long time of absence here is the review of the game [b]Assassin's Creed III Remastered[/b] the story is primarily set during the period of the American Revolution, with a protagonist named Connor Kenway. I remind you that this is my personal review, all my evaluations are based on my personal opinion, if you do not agree with certain points, it would be interesting to talk about it. But first you have to become an Assassin.

[h1] Assassin's Creed III Remastered [/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Assassin's Creed III Remastered[/b] is the fifth installment in the Assassin's Creed video game series, developed by Ubisoft. It is an action-adventure, stealth, platform, combat and adventure game. It was published on October 30, 2012, as the protagonist we find Connor Kenway (Ratonhnhaké:ton): An assassin of Native American and British origin, whose role is crucial in the fight between the Assassins and the Templars.

[*]As for the historical context, we find ourselves during the American Revolution (1754-1783), the game takes place during this tumultuous period, where the American colonies revolted against British domination.
[/list]
All original single-player DLC including The Tyranny of King Washington, and Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered are bundled with the game.

[b]Note:[/b] Multiplayer mode no longer available, servers are offline.⚠️

[h1] Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered [/h1]

The remastered version of the original [b]Assassin's Creed Liberation[/b] game is provided with the game, I am not going to review this game in addition to this one, to find the review of Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered, click here:

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
[list]

[*]To begin with, the main character's movements, whether on foot or by climbing structures, are generally fluid, contributing to an immersive experience. I can say that the combat system has also been improved to offer more fluid interactions, with more varied counter movements and attacks as well as even more spectacular eliminations than the previous opuses.

[*]Well, as always (otherwise it's not funny), the artificial intelligence of the enemies can sometimes seem predictable, which can reduce the perceived difficulty of certain sections of the game. And I'm not even talking about the weakness of the allies to certain missions.

[*]Naval missions add interesting gameplay to the game even if we can't do as much as we want, but our navigator or pirate will be present in the next game, the remastered version has benefited from improvements, offering a more refined experience and entertaining.

[*]For the side side of the game, I'm not going to talk about the story to avoid spoiling future players but some side missions are repetitive and without much interest or purpose, it's the kind of mission that gives you an objective without really subsequently affect the player experience or the flow of the story.

[/list]
[h1] Graphism [/h1]
[list] 

[*]This remastered version benefits from an improved graphics engine, offering sharper graphics and improved visual details compared to the original version. This version resolved several stability and performance issues present in the original game, providing a smoother gaming experience. Lighting effects have been improved, contributing to the game's more realistic and immersive atmosphere, especially during dynamic weather changes.

[*]I find that the character models can seem dated by current video game standards, which is respectable for a game from 2012. Certain animations in particular can sometimes seem stiff or off, affecting immersion. Some locations may suffer from uneven lighting, which can alter the visual experience in certain parts of the game.
[/list]

[h1] OST [/h1]
[list]

[*]The soundtrack features a variety of musical styles, ranging from more contemplative and emotional pieces to more dynamic and energetic compositions, thus adapting to the diversity of situations in the game. An epic and immersive atmosphere, perfectly complementing the key moments of the gameincluding certain musical themes are memorable and well integrated into the plot, reinforcing the emotional impact of key scenes in the game.

[*]The presence of repetitiveness in the soundtrack, where certain themes may appear to recur frequently, which could potentially diminish their impact. The integration of music in some parts of the game can feel uneven, with times where the music can seem intrusive or poorly coordinated with the action on screen.
[/list]

[h1] Do I recommend the game to you ? [/h1]

If you are looking for a breathtaking gaming experience, I recommend the game if you want to immerse yourself in a captivating historical epic, if you want to explore breathtaking environments and feel the intensity of the fights between Assassins and Templars. This game is made for you, I'm not going to say too much, I'll let you discover this game, and describe the secrets it contains, we'll see you very soon at the brotherhood, future assassin!

[b] The Positive's [/b]
+ Two Fully Fledged Story Campaigns

[b] The Aspect Of Games & DLC [/b]

[b] Assassins Creed III [/b]
[i] At the beginning of the game you play as a grand master templar Haytham Kenway who's goal is to seek out a hidden vault in the colonies of America. In the later half of the game you play as tribesman now assassin Ratonhnhaké:ton AKA Connor with the goal of stopping the templar activities in the American colonies. [/i]
 
[b] The Tyranny Of King Washington [/b]
[i] You once again step in the shoes of Ratonhnhaké:ton AKA Connor playing a three episode adventure of a different reality where Washington becomes corrupted by a piece of Eden and he must be taken down at any cost... [/i]

[b] Assassins Creed Liberation [/b]
[i] Step into the role of Aveline de Grandpré the first playable woman assassin who's fights for the New Orleans brotherhood. Who's goal is stop templar activities in the region while finding her lost mother in the downtime. [/i]

[b] My Two Cent Review [/b]

[b] Assassins Creed III [/b]
[i] This is actually the second time I have played and beaten AC III. I decided since I was going to attempt to play every AC game from to start finish I should take another look at this game from all those years ago. AC III isn't an amazing game but it is a good game. There are parts of the story I really like and then there parts of the story I really hate which same could be said for the missions you undergo. In the second half of the game you manage an estate and a trading business that I never cared enough to get off the ground fully. Some of the characters were just as memorable as when I first played the game many years ago and other characters mostly templars and anyone who isn't in a memory sequence for more then 4 missions. Lot's of collectibles just like other assassins creed games which I don't know who likes spending there free time looking for pages of an almanac but it's there for those who are bored enough to do so. Despite everything this was still a fun adventure! [/i]

[b] The Tyranny Of King Washington [/b]
[i] Oh boy this DLC is all over the place... You play as Conner in an alternate timeline where George Washington becomes king of America betraying every belief we have come to know about him in an epic three part episode. Through all three episodes one thought kept on going through my head and thought is ""WHAT THE FUCK AM I PLAYING?!"". You get a new super power each episode that will help you take down king George and his goons. [spoiler] Once you get the power of flight you can forget about parkouring for the rest of the game that power is just too damn OP. It's like playing Saints Row IV and getting superpowers I mean why use cars and planes anymore when you can just wall climb and fly in the air which planes and cars were a main mechanic in the other saints row games. So why parkour in AC when I just click a button and fly to any rooftop close by within 3 seconds?! [/spoiler] The endings about what I expected honestly for the DLC. This is not a DLC I will be revisiting anytime soon... [/i]

[b] Assassins Creed Liberation [/b]
[i] Gotta be honest wasn't a big fan of this one. Story was boring and the character was okay to play as but it didn't really stick to me like the other assassins I've played as in the past. They brought back that damn trading company side business you can run again which I never cared for originally. There are of course collectibles it wouldn't be an assassins creed game without them. [/i]

[b] The Value Of The Games & DLC [/b]
[i] It's a great thing to buy when your bored and want to waste some time but only if it's on sale. I do not believe this worth full price despite you getting two games and a DLC out of it. [/i]

Context: I bought all the AC games in a summer bundle, so I've been playing all of them for the first time back to back in release order.

I don't have much good to say specifically, but I did enjoy sequence breaking by killing bears with the animation of a hidden blade without having earned one yet. I did complete the game satisfied with my experience and willing to play it all over again in future. The actual interactions between Assassins and Templars was refreshing and I hope future games do it more often.

Biggest gripe: Horse movement. I don't expect Skyrim levels of off-road travel, where the horse can scale a mountain, but I'd at least like to ride around trees and hop down a small rock ledge, instead of getting a brake slam and whinny. I have pivoted around and tediously picked my way around rocks and snowbanks, in the name of filling in the map completely (Viewpoints are nerfed insanely when it comes to map discovery).
Personal gripe: I never quite adapted to the movement systems when they changed High Profile (Right click -> Shift), but there's parkour bits where Connor bends over a little or slides along the ground where it is VITAL that you are only pressing shift and forward, or else Connor wouldn't slide. Once my hands got used to pressing more buttons, I could side and back eject almost like previous games, but it always felt heavy/plodding.

Spoiler gripe: I wish I could have stabbed Lee instead of it being a cutscene.",1703237121,1703237121,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I guess the first thing is the damned audio levels, they are all over the place, no two scenes have the same audio levels, hell even in regular gameplay it seems that the audio levels are all over the place between NPC's walking past you, you constantly have to go into the settings and adjust the audio levels so that either you can HEAR what someone is saying, or so you don't get your eardrums burst from the character or SFX being louder than a jet engine in your room.

issue #2: the controls seem to have been messed up during this ""remaster"", by messed up I mean that the controls are slightly wrong when it comes to direction and speed. if you hold (on a controller obviously) straight forward, sometimes Conner will inexplicably veer slightly to the left or right at random moments, and this is something I have tested across multiple different controllers, and this isn't such a big deal when just running on the ground, but when you are parkouring across buildings like you do constantly in this game, then at points you will just fling yourself off in the wrong direction which a lot of times means that you are now no longer on that building and instead are on the ground. 

the third and final BIG issue I have with this ""remaster"" : the game crashes randomly during cutscenes or loading screens, I have tested disabling any background processes, tried running the .exe as admin, hell I've even verified the games files multiple times, fresh installed the game and started over on a new save. now while it's maybe 2-3 crashes in each ""act"" of the game, that is 2-3 more than there should be. 

in short, this ""remaster"" is a pile of steaming hot, rotting, shit covered, festering garbage.",1703184445,1703184445,False,11,0,0.557377040386199951,0,True,False,False

So far no crashes as other reviewers have complained.
You can put 21:9 aspect ratio but in menu, scenes and HUD is 16:9.... :(( atleast could of put HUD in 21:9
Edit:
20 hrs of gameplay - Mostly NPC buggs, like:
Spawning same multiple NPCs inside one NPC.
If you are in a city and run behind a house guards will see you and will try to shoot trough the whole house.
Same If you attack fort guards outside fort will keep shooting trough walls even If you are on the other side of the fort.
NPCs spawning in carts, inside stairs that are in forts that lead up to the walls.
Sometimes NPC will start sliding at you with their attacking animation.
You can get stuck in some places of forests between trees and rocks, so you need to restart from last checkpoint.
Parkour can glitch a bit, like you jump forward, you grab the edge and you get teleported 90° to the other edge of a building, wall or tree.
NPCs can spawn 10m-20m in front of you which is a bit anoying.
Dead soldiers can get resurrected for 1 sec and then go back to their dead position.
With animal attacks you will die in 99/100 times you fight them in close combat.
Stealth attacking animals is very buggy, you freez mid air so that animal gets speed up and runs away and you miss your target.
Fighting multiple enemys you get like cinematic camera with motion-blur and low sensitivity which is anoying.
Quests might fail, you need to kill target, you kill but nothing happens, after some time quest resets and you need to go do It again.
When there's mist and wind, next to houses with candles, If you go next to candle your screen will start to flicker from gray'ish mist to yellow and yes, flicker not something else.
Bells in forts don't really work as It triggers only good If half of the forts army.
If you shoot with bow at guard from stealth he can be invicable and will be getting only some knockback.
Some guards can start shooting at you, not being triggered and not being able to see you, they will shoot, stand for 1-3 sec and take out weapon again and shoot again. (You will receive damage.)
Guards mid fight might just start going away as If nothing happend while others fight me.
If you kill guards in stealth other guards will think that they sleep and won't do anything.
Horse can jump over 2m tall fallen tree but will stop at 20cm-30cm rock.

But all of that is kinda nitpicking, overall I like the game.",1700663044,1702396295,True,2,0,0.467496544122695923,0,True,False,False

Graphics: ★★★☆☆
Assassin's Creed III Remastered brings an improved visual experience to the critically acclaimed action-adventure franchise. While the graphics are undoubtedly upgraded, there are a few noticeable shortcomings. Character models and environments generally look great, but texture quality can be inconsistent at times. Overall, a visually satisfying experience that delivers a fresh coat of paint to an already stellar game.

Gameplay: ★★★★☆
Assassin's Creed III Remastered offers an engaging and polished gameplay experience that retains the essence of the original game. The parkour mechanics, combat system, and stealth elements all work seamlessly, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the expansive historical setting. The addition of some quality-of-life improvements and refined controls further enhance the overall gameplay experience.

Storyline: ★★★★★
As an integral part of the Assassin's Creed saga, the narrative of Assassin's Creed III remains as compelling as ever. The story follows the journey of Connor, an Assassin during the American Revolutionary War, as he battles the Templars to secure the freedom of his people. The depth of the characters and intricate plot twists keep players engrossed from start to finish. This thought-provoking storyline is an absolute masterpiece.

Audio: ★★★★☆
The audio design in Assassin's Creed III Remastered deserves high praise. The stirring background music, voice acting, and ambient sounds successfully create an immersive atmosphere that brings the historical setting to life. While there are occasional audio glitches that break immersion, the soundtrack and sound effects elevate the overall gaming experience.

Content: ★★★★☆
The remastered edition brings forward all the original content from Assassin's Creed III, including the main campaign and various side quests. Moreover, players will also get access to the bonus DLC content. This wealth of content offers countless hours of gameplay, making it a value-packed experience for both returning and new players alike.

Conclusion: ★★★★☆
Assassin's Creed III Remastered successfully revitalizes the classic game for modern consoles.

Fans of the franchise and new players alike will find much to appreciate in this gripping journey through history.",1702390194,1702390194,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

But I really like the story and the gameplay. The remaster definitely improves the chunkiness a lot. Controls are very responsive and it's a great game to play on the steam deck.

Finally, this is the one thing that might be make or break for many people. It's the Field of View (FoV). WTF is this shit. It took away so much from my enjoyment of the game.

The game is prone to crash on launch if not quit the game window not to let you access it again (Borderless gaming, switch to front/go to in task manager aren't solving the problem).
How about controller support ? Nope.
How much better are the graphics compared to the original ? Way worse, downgraded instead.
Is it at least stable ? Framerate is but all the rest is broken enough to make Todd blush !

It's a damn shame...
The original game in itself is excellent, narrative is close to 10/10 gameplay 7/10 (still clunky at times).
This version removed a part of the game (Not a long one but a key moment).
I'd advise to grab the original on PS3 (which to this day ia the best version taking all platforms and version in account by far).

PS3 version : 9.5/10
This port 0.5/10

 Assassin's Creed 3 is the second AC game I've played, and boy were my hopes dashed. I'll mention here I completed the whole story, every side quest I could, and got 91% completion on the game. I won't mention the uPlay launcher issues, as that's expected in every Ubisoft game.

[h2] Pros: [/h2]
- [b]Guard AI. [/b] The AI seems to be quite a bit smarter with guards compared to AC2, actually being able to hurt you from further away, mainly because of guns, but more enemies will climb up to you as well, making roof tops far more dangerous compared to AC2.
- [b] Naval combat! [/b] My favorite part of this game, the introduction of ships and naval missions. Firing cannons can be a little janky at times, but the missions feel fresh and a nice change of pace to break up the main story line. Add upgrades to your ship and you've got a great gameplay loop in a vacuum.
- [b] Side Characters. [/b] Achilles and many of the other side characters that get included in your homestead missions are people you can actually get invested in. You meet most in a dynamic way, in the middle of their lives falling apart, similar to Connors life. You give them a better life, hopes, and dreams of the future in conversations that make you care about them. It'd be even better if Connor wasn't a brick wall of a conversation maker.

[h2] Cons: [/h2]
- [b] Connor. [/b] He's about as plain as a cardboard box. His comments are few and add little to anything he's apart of. He's an annoying character despite that. I somewhat understand why they've done this, but even contrasting with Haythem, who can be witty but serious as the same time, it's a massive downgrade compared Ezio in AC2.
- [b] Level design. [/b] Despite the worlds being larger compared to AC2, it feels more empty due to less shops and buildings you can go into. Shops are all in one general stores now, instead of separate weapon, art, doctors, and clothing stores. There's no brothels or thieves guilds either which helped break up the skyline. They counteract this with minigames, which are quite common, but lack any flavor or real reason to play them. No story tid-bits, gossip, and terrible rewards when offered.
- [b] Crafting system. [/b] Just like AC2, you get a ""city"" to be in charge of. This time being a homestead, where via quests you can gain new people to offer new materials to craft with and trade for profit. Worry not though, we'll make it as painful as possible to use. Everything costs money, which your fellow homesteaders don't produce at all compared to AC2. Plenty of weapons are locked behind crafting requires that I feel most players will ignore entirely. The highest level of crafting also isn't unlocked until the very end of the game, Sequence 11-12.
- [b] Restrictive tools. [/b] The game teaches you to use ranged weapons like muskets, pistols, and your bow to deal with enemies from afar. Of course to enforce this extension of your range, they include lots of chase missions where you kill the person upon catching, but aren't allowed to use said ranged weapons. As an example, during one of the missions several of the templars you are sworn to kill are easily within range of your weapons, but if your ranged weapons are just fully restricted instead of proper level design. The game picks and chooses when you're allowed to use the tools you're provided, which just causes frustration.
- [b] The Story. [/b] It's quite predictable, switching between Real world and Connor missions. In the RW it's a man with daddy issues and a team of characters that do nothing but complain during a 2012 end of the world event. In Connors case, it's a naive man trying to kill people who are targeting his people, and get this, more daddy issues.

[h2] TLDR: [/h2]
  AC3 lacks a compelling story, main character, and environment. City development took a major step back, ranged weapons are heavily restricted, and the crafting system is tedious and outdated to use. I wouldn't recommend it, as AC2 is a far better game, and AC4 has better ship play if that's what you're looking for.",1701901415,1701901415,False,4,1,0.490960210561752319,0,True,False,False

TL;DR Genuinely an awful experience. Cyberpunk on release was less buggy than this (slight exaggeration). If you do decide to get assassin's creed 3 regardless of this review and many others, Good luck. 

The first 4 games were a rocky road to say the least. The first game playing more like a concept than anything, but the 2nd game had so much pull that you wanted to see it to its end and overall it was a good experience more or less. I am glad I got to play Ezio's trilogy despite its flaws. I was rather hoping to finish Desmond's story, and I'm sure I will when I can face it. 

I haven't played the original AS3, mainly because you can't get it anymore. I'm sure the remake has taken away from the experience rather than adding to it (unlike its price tag). The bugs coming from a cheap reproduction of an already finished game. Awful animations instead of charming 2010 limitations like the first few games. It's really sad to see, I hope the games of now are handled with more care when it's time for them to be remade.  

As far as story well I'm no critique especially when it comes to genuinely good story telling, pacing and overall quality, but I know what I like and this ain't it if I'm honest. I'll leave it there as like I say I'm not a critique or at least not a good one. I like bad stories and I dislike good ones sometimes.

This will be forever one of my favorite AC games. The game came out during my 11th/12th grade year in High School right when I was taking US History. It was absolutely EPIC to learn about the revolution in school and go home and play it in Assassins Creed. I adored experiencing the story of the American colonies and the events in Boston on school and then at home so much, I barely even had time for my girlfriend. Being able to experience history through both mediums made this a 10/10 when I first played it.

Remastering makes a good game better, there are very few cases where a bad game gets better with a simple remaster. AC3 was always fantastic, Remastering it just made it shine more. 

The world looks miles better, the people look like total s**t. It’s kinda buggy on controls but the combat and climbing’s still good as ever. Colonial America looks completely transformed. Gone are the grey filters and lifeless streets. Now It feels like Boston and New York are actual cities with very unique personalities.

It has all the good parts and bad parts of the original version when it comes to gameplay. For example, the combat is extremely smooth and fluid while attempting to play stealthily is still a pain in the ass due to the oversensitive detection meter of the guards.

Connor was my personal favorite character in all of AC. He's hyper focused, loyal, and stoic yet kind and deeply sensitive and understanding. He was slightly hindered by the writing of the story, but you can definitely see his character shining through.

I also love how Ac3 is kind of cinematic. It is more touching and handcrafted in its cutscenes. I was blown away by how some simple stuff was made interesting and ""artful"" on Haytham's initial segments. 

On a whole, I would definitely say that it's worth the money. If you enjoyed the original AC III, then you're sure to enjoy the remastered version as well. If you've never played AC III, I'd still wholeheartedly recommend this as long as you keep in mind that this is mainly a combat game and not a traditional AC game where stealth is very important.

Maybe it's because of the remaster version because I don't originally remember this game being this bad, but it's still the least liked game in my book.

It has interesting moral debates similar to AC1's post assassination discussions. 

It has pretty funny inter-character dialogue and chemistry on the same level as AC2.

The parkour of this game [i]can[/i], I repeat [i]CAN[/i] look good, but the game trips and falls constantly. Often, enemies you chase run in efficient straight lines. Spending any time climbing up and down is a massive waste of time and the only option is to run like normal person. [i]Normie's Creed 3[/i]. Even if the enemy was slow enough to catch with parkour, there are times when there are no parkour-able objects nearby. The real problem, is the choices of locations for this game. Boston and New York suffer from [i]city planning[/i] and as a result have pretty consistent straight lines and common unparkourable wide streets. And casual parkouring through the forest is a pain. Tree Parkouring, again, can look good, but it is quite the learning curve to know what is and isn't climbable.

The combat of this game is more cinematic, in both good and bad ways. The main character has to do a complete flurry of attacks to kill somebody. So if, god forbid, you stab someone in the abdomen only 4 times instead of 5, that person is completely healthy and will go back to attacking you. To put this victim down you have to stab him 5 or so times in a chain, not in total, so the theoretical amount of stabs someone can take approaches infinty. This may be a personal skill issue, but I did not understand how counterkilling worked in this game until the second to last mission. Unlike AC1-R, to counter kill you have to hold the counter button and the attack button instead of just tapping them, i think. I dont really know, but after I started to hold these buttons, combat felt way better.

Dont bother with the Ubisoft Checklist of collectibles. Dont bother with synchronization either.

The visuals in this game range from ok to bad. Mostly ok. This is due to the limited heights and weird fog in the developing cities. Some characters look horrendous like the boy from the theater and Juno.

The set pieces are usually very cool and fun. Running through burning ships is cool! But sometimes, either the runup to or the entire set piece doesnt really feel Assassiny. I dont think an assassin should run directly at a line of muskets...

Ship gameplay is in its infancy here.

The DLC is very weird in a good way.

[b]AC III[/b] : very good, I'd place it third after the original AC and Revelations. (I haven't played further AC games as of this review.)
[list]
[*]What I enjoyed : The combat mechanics feel insanely good in this game. Enemies are harder because they can block and counter you, sometimes unforgivingly so, but finishing them is always violent and bloody. Very, very satisfying. There are forts to take over that require combat skills, stealth skills, a bit of thinking and planning, so it's super rewarding when you manage to capture one. I liked all characters, they all have a lot of personality. The relationship (or lack thereof) between Haytham and Connor was all at once interesting, funny, and heartbreaking. Most sidequests are related to the plot so it did not feel like sidetracking to do them. And if you don't want to engage with side mechanics (like trading or crafting) it doesn't take away from the game. Finally, the environment and characters evolve throughout the story so it helps feel immersed in the world.
[*]What I didn't enjoy : The story took SO LONG to start. Spending three chapters establishing who Haytham is and what he's doing is just too long. Spending two more exploring Connor's past is just too long. That's almost half of the game ! I spent my time pleading ""just get to the point !!"" And once the story started it was a bit confusing to follow, in part because the Assassin/Templar divide does not always line up with the conflict itself, and because it feels like the game assumes you're familiar with the people and events. Which I am not. Finally, at one point you enter a new city but you CANNOT explore it because you're immediately caught in an inescapable quest, that takes the whole chapter to resolve. It's an important event and emotionally charged, but I spent my time shaking in frustration just wanting to explore. So extremely bad timing.
[/list]
While writing this review I realised there are lots of negative points (I didn't write everything), but overall I truly enjoyed playing it and I like the game as a whole.

[b]Liberation[/b] : mostly good, but mixed feelings.
[list]
[*]What I enjoyed : Finally playing a female character in a story with important female characters. The fact that missions can be resolved differently depending on which persona you choose to play. The very dynamic combat like in AC III, while keeping stealth as an important mechanic. Regarding the plot, while some things were easy to guess and others I was simply spoiled about, I had a few unexpected surprises that made sense in retrospect, so that felt good. The easy to guess things are easy only if you pay attention, so it's rewarding when you get to the point when your theories are confirmed.
[*]What I didn't enjoy : The story was incredibly confusing. While I understand the different characters' goals, I did not understand how they related to the missions I had to do. And the whole thing about Erudito showing up to tell you how things really happened adds to the confusion because it comes with no context (fortuntaly I was spoiled about that). It was also tedious to have to use one specific persona to do some missions, because you have to find a spot to change and you may be restricted in what you do. And when I stumbled upon a side quest for one persona while wearing another, I simply did not bother to do it^^'

After playing from AC1 to AC Brotherhood ,I was pleasantly surprised to not be fatigued by the gameplay and mechanics yet ,so i was excited for AC 3. Oh boy ,for every step forward it does 2 steps backwards. It felt like a soft reboot made by a different companie.
The specifics:
-The weapon wheel is gone and has been replaced with a menu screen where you can change your main and secondary weapon .
-You now need to change your ranged weapon to be able to call your horse for some fucking reason.
-Now most of the map is just woods and cities where most buildings are too far from each other to jump form rooftop to rooftop so you will do much much less parkour then any other AC games that came before it.
-Unlike previous installment when time elapse you just sit there and wonder why would your character just sit there and wait for things to happen and not further its cause, it doesn't feel justified in the slightest.
-The father son relationship is barely addressed in the entire game and the only missions you do with your father are the only missions where your character doesn't stop blabbering with the other character your with.
-Alot of missed opportunity with cinematic that could have been interesting playable set piece.
-Many stupid plot point made to make the game artificially longer.
-Removal of alot of mechanics like sending your assassins on mission to replace with mechanics that you wont need for the entirety of the game.
-Low incentive to do any side mission or trading since you all you can do with the money is buy different main and ranged weapons.

If you wish you can check my review for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/recommended/208480?snr=1_5_9__402]Assassin's Creed III[/url] and my review for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/recommended/260210/]Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD[/url], where I ""talk"" about Assassin's Creed III & Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD as ""whole"" games.[/i]

Assassin's Creed III Remastered offers a bundle of two games, Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD. I'll break down my review into the good and bad aspects.

Starting with Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD, the remaster delivers noticeable improvements in graphics, environment, and lighting. Bugs were significantly reduced, making for a smoother gaming experience compared to the original. While some textures weren't replaced, this doesn't detract from the overall positive impression of the remaster. The addition of new features from the ACIII remaster, such as the mini-map, is a welcome enhancement.

As for Assassin's Creed III, the remaster impresses during outdoor activities like parkour and combat, offering stunning visuals and a vibrant atmosphere. The updated lighting adds a refreshing touch, although some may find certain instances of orange lighting to be overdone. The remaster includes new implementations missing from the original, like double-assassination from behind, killing from bushes, and improved free-aim with ranged weapons. These additions enhance the gameplay significantly. Additionally, some textures have been updated, adding to the overall positive experience of the remaster.

However, the story-mode faces some issues. The lighting at times breaks immersion, especially indoors, and weather effects occasionally act inconsistently. But the most significant problem lies with the character faces. While some remain the same as the original, others have been reworked and appear downgraded. This discrepancy is noticeable when comparing the original to the remaster, and it becomes the most substantial complaint about the remaster.

Furthermore, the remaster disappoints by not updating all in-game textures. Many textures remain unchanged, resulting in a clash with the improved lighting and visuals.

Another letdown is the locked 60fps cap. While the original allowed higher framerates, the animations from the original were not meant to be played at higher than 60 fps and they would at times break. The remaster fails to repair this, instead falsely presents the option to change the hz in the settings, but the fps stays capped at 60. 

A a big disappointment for me is not including Connor's amazing monologue. Check it [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5bNt2LAfm8]here[/url] if you don't know what I mean. It's a missed opportunity not to include it, as it was also missing in the original, and it has been requested since forever.

Regarding multiplayer, the remaster does not have it at all, which may disappoint fans who enjoyed that aspect. Not me though. Although Ubisoft's decision to remove the original games from purchase is a really horrible move. Only to force players into buying the remaster. Offering players the choice between the original and remastered versions would have been a fairer approach.

Despite these criticisms, the remaster mostly shines, offering a stunning experience during 90% of the playthrough. For newcomers to the series or those who never played the original, the remaster provides an enjoyable experience without any complaints. However, for players familiar with the original, the downgraded character faces remain a significant concern, overshadowing the otherwise positive aspects of the remaster.

In terms of price, the remaster offers a good deal comparing to the prices of the two original games + their DLCs they once had. Best of all, you can get this whole remastered package for free (check if still available) if you purchase the Assassin's Creed: Odyssey Season Pass. 

For achievement hunters: on the downside, the lack of properly implemented achievements on Steam is a letdown. Although present in the remaster (84), players cannot see them in-game or on Steam, making it difficult to showcase their accomplishments. One can only see them as [url=https://imgur.com/gallery/iGRbtNj]screenshots[/url], on [url=https://www.backloggery.com/games.php?user=ciocolici&search=Assassin%27s+Creed+III%3A+Remastered&console=&status=&unplayed=&rating=&region=&own=0&alpha=1]Backloggery[/url], and written by myself on my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/]Steam profile[/url]. The only place where you can see your achievements officially is Ubisoft Connect, but unfortunately, at the time I am writing this, they have still even to this day not implemented a way for people to see your achievements there, only you can do it. On top of that, (again: at the time I am writing this) you don't even get in-game notifications when you unlock/earn an achievement, with or without Ubisoft Connect's overlay on, with or without Ubisoft Connect's notifications options enabled.
If you go for 100% sync and do everything there is to be done in the game, you will end up with only a handful of achievements missing. These handful of achievements are though some of them not the easiest to complete. Especially ""Original Gamer"" and ""An Extraordinary Man"". And, of course, doing everything that's optional in an Assassin's Creed game, and going for 100% sync, is a challenge and time-consuming feat itself. Completing this game is not an easy task at all.",1680516402,1696201764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Past reviews have mentioned it had quite a bit of negative feedback, and as you play along you can see why many hate this game in comparison to other AC series . Its true- not really much of remastered, it still feels old and glitchy. But if you do get a chance to download the game keep you expectations low and you will have a good time exploring colonial America which is made quite nicely in comparison to everything else in the game

[h3] Gameplay [/h3]-  it has a big learning curve for occasional gamers, meaning theres too many concepts to learn as you play the story, which seems nice in the start but you will realize you will have to wait for instructions every time and will never feel confident on the controls which may make you feel a bit irritated. Then adding to the discomfort of this is the non Intuitive movements of the character(s) through obstacles, just be prepared to keep restarting the mission if you want to finish the challenges and the mission in a smooth way, this honestly felt it wasnt at all developed to a final stage.
Few details regarding graphics were nice, tree movements and animals attacking make it less stressful at times. It gave a nice feel of Colonial America. Also extra activities and board  games played during that time were added which is a nice break from stressing on not able to complete a mission.

[h3] Storyline [/h3]- Okay now this is subjective, but in short- they could have thought a bit more on the character development, thats really missing as you play along or it doesnt come out strong as you end the game. The excitement or drama is missing for a long story telling process. One aspect for this missing element is that we don't engage much on the story line as a player- it passes of as cutscenes so we dont engage too many elements that feels like being a bi stander
Tho the ending does seem to wrap up nicely with a nice touch of drama  but finishes quickly with a lot of conclusions all cramped together.

[b] In conclusion [/b]- dont buy it as a standalone or in full rate, do play it or atleast try it out for a short while if you are a AC series fan cause its still a bit of Assassin in it tho maybe a lot weak in comparison to its previous series.it has a lot of flaws but again its a n AC game so if you want to play for the knowledge of what the story is  can try it out for a while before you give up.

conner is such a good MC and i love him, easily my favorite assassin
the other characters are all also done amazingly and feel so real
voice acting is some of the best imo, conner and haythem especially are top tier
story is soild, nothing great but not bad either
the open world feels great and the attention to detail is nice
combat(when it works right) feels so cool and smooth 

CONS-
janky game, nothing works right,ever,
freeruning is so horrible and feels like you have 0 control over where you go and you will accidentally jump to your death
combat is awful 7/10 times, feels like batman arkham origins, but WAY worse, you have to counter before the counter indicator shows up otherwise you just get hit, its guess work figuring out how to counter some enemies as some will just block your counter and punch you in the face, if your using anything other then a heavy axe youll have to hit someone 5+ times in a row before the die, if you break your combo using a sword or blade then you have to restart the combo over as enemies dont have HP rather just how many times you hit them.
unresponsive controls, ill press a button and for whatever reason it just wont register the input

Most people I know if you asked them about the British Empire they would look upon it with a mixture of pride and shame. We know we were massive dicks about things but it’s ancient history now.

Anyway, AC3 is the fifth instalment, Ubisoft apparently forgetting how to count, set during the American war for independence and is the start of what I think of as the second generation of Assassin’s Creed games defined by an improved free-running engine, open wilderness over sprawling cities and a de-emphasis on the struggle between Assassin’s and Templars in favour of exploring the setting. It’s almost laughable how you just stumble upon every major character and event from that time period. Every plot point is contrived coincidence just so they can crowbar in what feels like fan service.

Desmond’s woken up from his coma in the last game and has travelled to a precursor control room that will apparently save the world in some way. He’s got no idea how to use it but thankfully, the ghost of Juno knocks him out and his mated plug him back into the animus because it’s the only thing they know. They’re like those 18th century doctors and leaches, their only bloody solution to every problem is to plug you back into the animus. We also get to do some free-running segments outside the animus as he looks for batteries to power the machine, which is nice because so far the series hasn’t made much use of the potential for a modern Assassin’s Creed, running up the side of skyscrapers, infiltrating stadiums and slaughtering his way through Abstergo facilities.

For the first few hours, you play as Haytham, a composed and often bewildered British gentleman with an undercurrent of violence always ready with a sarcastic quip who sails for America searching for a first civilization storehouse, which may confuse anyone who looked at the cover art and saw a Native American in assassin whites. In the first scene of the game, he stabs someone up for a key that Desmond needs to turn the machine on, and that Haytham eventually discovers is no use to him as he can’t get past the door.
The game then shifts to his son Connor, a half-Mohawk boy whose mother, whose name I won’t even try to pronounce, is killed when the Templars burn his village down. He then goes off to join the Assassins when a glowing crystal ball says it’s the only way to protect his village from the encroaching European settlers and then we’re just stumbling from event to event doing everything from the history books about the independence war. The line that had me in hysterics was “How could this happen?! We destroyed the tea!” It’s a shame because Haytham was full of personality and I was enjoying playing as him, whereas Connor is a bit of a blank slate with no charisma.

It sound’s strange, but I didn’t feel like I was playing a game with this one. It’s more like a movie where I occasionally get to play the concluding scene. There’re lengthy cutscenes setting up a mission, and then the mission will be an extremely linear set of instruction following with little room for improvisation where often the support character does the work for you. And then it’s back to lengthy cut scenes to conclude the mission. This is a video game. You’re supposed to weave the narrative into gameplay, not just make me sit here watching your pre-animated movies.

Also, I don’t think they did a good job marrying the main Assassin’s versus Templars plot with the Civil War plot. You’re supposed to help out in the war to get closer to your targets but events unfold with a kind of inevitability that to me didn’t make any sense. I was struggling to see why everyone all agreed throwing tea into a harbour would solve all their problems. I think maybe we were too close to events, or even possibly too far. All the decisions are made by people you’ve only just bumped into or some minor secondary character and Connor just goes along with it and we end up with no agency in the story. The plot was strongest when it avoided the civil war stuff so I think we should have been either stabbing people up while a war happened in the background, or maybe we should have been leading it. Round about sequence 8 the game picks up for me but that’s a hell of a slog to get there.

I’ve mentioned it before but I really don’t like the environments this time round. They’re wooden ramshackle towns separated by a sparse, and yet somehow compacted, wilderness with no interesting landmarks to explore. Running through the streets of Constantinople, the entire map was built around how fun it is to scale buildings and towers from multiple sides, and leaping from roof to roof because the streets below were a maze. You don’t get that here. The maps have been built with historical accuracy in mind and often the only free-running sections are linearly laid out taking away the go-anywhere freedom that has defined the series. It’s a real shame.

Free-running has been much improved. It no longer requires me to hold down two buttons to run. Now it’s just hold down the trigger and you’ll sprint up a tree. Oh yeah, you can climb trees now, seeing as we’re a wilderness sandbox and there’s not many buildings about, along with rocks. I was impressed the first time I learned I could climb vertical crags, not sure why. But it created a freedom of movement that wasn’t previously available so I guess I just appreciated the step forward amongst the rest of the game’s flamboyant summersault backward.

Some complexity has been put back into combat requiring well-timed button pushes to counter enemy attacks, and it still flows well. I quite liked the feature where you can use an enemy as a human shield when you’re being shot at. This is the 18th century so muskets and flint-lock pistols are common, and I was surprised to see the game go for a realistic approach to reloading them, meaning it takes about fifteen years so you’re probably better off just grabbing a fresh one off a corpse. There’s also a new range of assassination tools to play with, which are interesting but that I never used because it’s never as efficient as just stabbing them.

Rather than buying up the whole of Rome, this time you’re given a manor house and its surrounding land to manage. You can unlock new buildings, upgrade existing ones and trade resources for money which is done in a similar way as to how sending your assassins on mission was done in the last two games and is kinda necessary now normal missions don’t pay out. This brings me to the point that one of my favourite parts of those games were the assassin recruits who grew as you used them and, while that’s still here, it’s been scaled down to just certain specific characters who don’t grow or evolve which is disappointing. But I don’t mind that because what they’ve been replaced with are naval missions where you upgrade your ship and sail around blowing up anything that looks at you funny and it’s a whole barrel of fun. These missions, for me at least, are easily the highlight of the game. You have to pay attention to wind direction, fullness of sails, rocks, enemy vessels, all sorts of stuff. I particularly enjoyed the stormy mission where fifty-foot rogue waves threatened to ruin your day and you had to duel a boat in between them.

The core issue with Assassin’s Creed 3 is that for a good portion of the game the player is just a bystander to the main plot and as such it’s impossible to be invested. Assassinating the Templars and arguing the philosophy was interesting and it should have lent more into that but the ending wraps everything up nicely and conclusively ends the Desmond arc, I suspect so they didn’t have to keep crowbarring him into whatever setting they wanted to do next. Despite all its faults I did enjoy the game but I definitely think it’s the weakest of the series.",1694426257,1694426257,True,3,0,0.510819554328918457,0,True,False,False

I got this for free with Assassin's Creed Odyssey, but I had played it previously on the PS3 and decided to give it another crack on PC.

Desmond Miles returns as our core protagonist, along with the Animus, which is again being used to uncover the past and the conflict between Assassins and Templars. The game is set around the time of the American Revolutionary War and centres around a Native American ancestor of Desmond's named Connor, beginning with his early life and training as an assassin. You'll explore the burgeoning cities of New York and Boston, as well as the wilds of the American frontier, participate in some notable historical events of the Revolutionary War and sail your own ship on the Atlantic.

The PC port is nothing spectacular and features a varierty of bugs, graphical and audio issues, some rather embarrassing control issues when using a mouse and keyboard... it's definitely far from perfect. But for those who've played it previously or who've enjoyed other Assassin's Creed titles, I still think it's deserving of a buy, when on sale.

There is nothing wrong per se with AC3, but aside from the new setting and protagonist, it does not offer much new to the franchise (except perhaps the sailing mini-games). As a player, to enjoy this game, you have to find your balance and/or threshold for enjoying the main story versus trying to complete every arbitrary achievement or every menial side quest. Still, the game is a solid Assassin's Creed game, when compared to the prior games in the series. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]
No real revelations since Revelations when it comes to gameplay mechanics with the exception of the sailing missions--but even those are not a new in-game mechanic but rather separate mini-games, albeit pretty good ones. The Remastered version may have introduced some other changes, but overall the mechanics are mostly the same as in the prior three games. In the frontier section of the game, there are some hunting mechanics not found previously in the series.  The expansion of the homestead, the protagonist's base of operations, was a nice addition and did provide some moments of levity and quiet.

[b]Characters/Customization[/b]
The new protagnist has a reasonably interesting story arc as a character, but unfortunately the voice acting performance lacked the correct rhythm and energy to entice me as the player and perhaps some of the ""angst"" dialogue written for the protagonist did not help their cause. So while the protagonist was great in a fight, I did not particularly look forward to the dramatic performances during cutscenes. In terms of customization, the new protagonist has pretty large assortment of outfits and weapons, although I pretty quickly settled on one outfit for the majority of the game. 

[b]Story/Atmosphere[/b]
In the early going, I found the new setting to be fresh and remarkably polished (perhaps courtesy of the Remaster). The New England setting during the days leading to the American Revolution should have been a rich source of inspiration. Colonial cities of Boston and New York are reasonably well represented, but at some point repetitive architecture and the mobs of cloned civilians and British soldiers start to dull the mind.  The ""frontier"" component of AC3 is also bit hit and miss--pretty landscape but not too many memorable landmarks: just a big patch of land with a few colonial buildings.

Overall the story of AC3 is pretty much par for the series except it does contain a remarkable plot twist, certainly the best one in the series to this point, certainly more intriguing than those non-sensical sci-fi events occuring outside the Animus.  The main story does try to tangentially touch on events that were taking place during the American Revolution with mixed success.

[b]Graphics/Sound[/b]
The Remastered version of AC3 looked and sounded good (although I did not play the original AC3, so I cannot say if the Remastered version looked or sounded better. For the most part, the engine seemed fairly similar to the one used in the prior two games.  I did not encounter any bugs that come to mind.

[b]Replay Value:[/b] None.  At the time of writing this review, I have not embarked on the DLC yet and still have some unfinished side quests--namely sailing mission--and I am undecided whether I will complete those or not before moving on to the next game in the series.

[b]Overall Score:[/b] 7/10

This surprises me, not because the game is exceptionally good, (it's not), nor that you need to play it (you most certainly don't), but because it seems to be at least a minor improvement on the games that came before it, which themselves were, at best, mediocre. While I've not played any subsequent releases, the plot is just as engaging as the Ezio and Altair entries. The voice acting is solid outside a scant few characters (I don't speak Mohawk, but the clan mother's performance is as wooden as the forest.)  The main line missions are varied and often fun. The new sea-faring battles are probably the best and most original gameplay element in the series up to this point, period,  Building a town in the homestead is a novel and worthwhile variation on how to add a ton of side-quests, and all in all, it works.

For completionists, the game can be a grinding slog, with many nearly meaningless collection side-quests and tasks, but in a wilderness outerworld, a developing town, and two colonial cities, that grind seems a tad more varied than similar quests in the games before it.  Dropping some of the previous quest typess, namely feather collection and assassin guild training, would have made the game more fun, but it appears that Ubisoft wants to keep growing the individual games until they're bloated.

Like I said, I do think the plot is fairly strong, but this is despite the main character, not because of him. Besides occasional anger issues, Connor is too much of a white knight, and he can be aloof to the point of icy and idealistically naive, emotionally pushing away many of the parties he's trying to help and save.  Avoiding spoilers, there is another, far less heroic character (or three) that if adjusted to be less fundamentally immoral, could have made for a more interesting protagonist.

The controls are a bit glitchy, but the combat and stealth, for the most part, work.  The battling like all games in this genre, becomes monotonous, but there's enough weapons, environments, and enemy types, to keep it borderline entertaining. 

To reiterate, the game is not great.  But I read of players who consider skipping from Revelations to Black Flag, and frankly, it's not bad enough to justify such a course.

After AC1 left a bad taste my mouth, having abandoned it after multiple attempts, I avoided the series throughout the Ezio trilogy when they were first released. Yes, a thing I regret later on. The trailer for AC3 got me so hyped up to kill redcoats that it drew my back in. I'm a sucker for American history, being from here of course. And being from the NY region that the game was set made it even more relatable. When I finally began playing I found a far more polished Assassin's Creed experience. The combat was a blast, the story was engaging and coherent, everything was improved! And then... that opening twist! Boy howdy this game had me hooked.

I was shocked to find that it was a fairly popular opinion that this was a weaker entry to the series around it's release. But it seems that over the years, public opinion has grown far kinder to it. And this remaster certainly helps. Upgraded graphics, cleaner UI, bug fixes (though not all of them, this is still a Ubisoft game after all). The lighting in particular makes such a difference. Don't be turned off by the hideous screenshots you may see of facial animations during cut-scenes. Yes they are there but they're such a small part of the game-play experience. When you're actually in the game and playing as Connor, the improvement of the world is far more appreciable. I'm not really sure what happened to the faces close-up though.

Also included in this remaster was Assassin's Creed: Liberation. I had played this one before and also replayed it now. And both left me kind of... meh? Not a terrible entry but also nothing exceptional. If it weren't for the remaster I likely would not have replayed this one and stuck strictly to the main-line games. Makes me wonder if I want to replay Freedom Cry. I'm sure this was a good game for portable gaming or on the toilet. And the remaster certainly makes it more playable for modern desktops.

Overall, Asssassin's Creed III is a must play entry to the series. Be it the original or the remaster. Liberation is probably a pass unless you're an AC superfan.",1692684275,1692684275,True,1,0,0.507692337036132813,0,True,False,False

I didn't play this title when it originally released because i wasn't interested in the franchise at the time, but bought the remastered version some time ago to play when i was ready.

What i was not ready for, was what met my expectations from other releases.  To put it simply, and in modern terms, this remastered version of the original game, released in 2019 as you can see in the page, is nearly as clunky and clippy as cyberpunk when it first released.  Ubisoft, you do yourselves no favors attaching this to Ubisoft Connect as well, requiring pointless, redundant validation.  I understand you are told what to do, but if you want to make good games, you need to stand up to the marketing team.

The combat system gets very confused, especially when the player is on uneven terrain, to the point where my character was stuck in certain sequences during combat until i pressed the original key that started the move again.  I could go on, but encourage players to find their own ways of breaking this...very volatile combat system.

The game feels like I am in a hallway.  I understand there needs to be backstory between Desmond and the AC lore, but I feel the game was robbed by pre-shaping the protagonist and storyline so much.  I wanted to meet those historical figures on my own terms, and as they were, not as someone else wanted them perceived, when they wanted.  I feel you regained this magic in Odyssey, but it is not here.

There's new weapons, new mechanics, new maps, and new ways to play the game. AC Brotherhood builds even more, giving you upgrades to your old weapons, and the ability to build a team and call them in to strike when you need someone else to take out a target for you. The storytelling is the best part of these games though, the way they explain what's happening by showing, not telling is masterful. They let you understand the story from the perspective of the character you play as, and reveal information as they would know it.

AC 3 rewinds a lot of things. The UI looks like Time Splitters 2, the ""remastered,"" graphics are hot garbage, they didn't build on anything AC2's trilogy had to offer, like mechanics, weapons, or anything, and the storytelling reminds me of those old hood movies like Baby Boy and Juice, where they narrate the entire time. Fucking boo, I'm loathing the game and moving on.

Also, I skipped Revelations because it wasn't in the AC bundle for some reason. No idea why, but Brotherhood ends with someone getting stabbed and I have no idea how Desmond's dad got here.

[b] Assassin’s Creed III [/b]
Assassin’s Creed III is the fifth installment in a third-person stealth franchise that uses historical drama to tell its narrative. The story follows directly after the last game, where Desmond has woken up from his coma and is using the memories of a different ancestor. This time we explore the history of 18th-century Colonial America at the beginning of the American Revolution. You take control of an Indigenous American who, for brevity’s sake, we’ll refer to as Connor.

It’s immediately evident that this game is much more ambitious than its predecessors. Using a brand-new engine with a much larger world and an expanded range of game mechanics. However, they have prioritized flashy combat over the stealth mechanics featured in earlier titles.

The choice of setting AC3 in Colonial America, not only limits the architectural features to admire but also compromises the parkour aspect. The camera is positioned closer to Connor, creating a sense of confinement and he feels less responsive and more sluggish to control, particularly when compared to previous installments.

Despite these complaints, there is a glimmer of hope in the form of AC3's innovative addition of naval combat. While deviating from the traditional Assassin's Creed gameplay, this feature is a welcomed addition largely absent from video games at the time, save for top-down strategy games. You face formidable ships and battalions whilst contending with stormy weather and large waves. It’s both thrilling and claustrophobic, whilst you learn to anticipate the delay in maneuvering your large vessel. 

Sadly, I have very little to say regarding the narrative, other than a clever bait-and-switch that I’m not going to spoil, there wasn’t much intrigue to be had. As someone not as familiar with the finer details of early American history, I’m not qualified on the accuracy of the depicted events. It mostly felt like a slideshow of all the significant events, with Connor serving as the sole driving force behind each part of the American Revolution. 
However, I must commend the portrayal of certain historical figures, such as Benjamin Franklin, who, from my understanding was a chauvinistic and generally unpleasant guy.

[b] DLC: [/b]
Tyranny of King Washington is a brief non-canon narrative that is included in this edition of AC3. For what it’s worth it’s a bit more experimental incorporating more fantastical abilities in the form of animal spirit guides. The Eagle ability made rooftop traversal a much more pleasant experience, something the aforementioned core game didn’t manage to do. 
While not an essential component, it is a worthwhile addition.

[b] Assassin’s Creed Liberation Remastered [/b]
Originally released on the handheld console Playstation Vita, the gameplay resembles AC:2 albeit with some minor adjustments. Set in 18th-century French Louisiana, the game follows the story of Aveline, the first black female protagonist in the franchise. 

The narrative delves into the transatlantic slave trade and the player is required to experiment with Aveline’s relation to class and gender. 
Aveline can alter her appearance to suit specific social circumstances, which can either limit or enhance her combat capabilities. 

For instance, her dress may impede her movement but enable her to blend in with the upper-class society she belongs to. Alternatively, she can don a slave or assassin disguise, which provides her with greater mobility but also restricts her movements in certain areas. Despite its small scale, the game manages to tell a more captivating story than the one it was bundled with.

[b] Conclusion: [/b]
AC3 is my least favorite game in the series thus far. This is unfortunate as the opportunity to explore the American Revolution from the perspective of an Indigenous person presents a wealth of potential for an engaging and thought-provoking experience. Despite efforts to improve upon previous titles, AC3, unfortunately, retains the series' most unfavorable aspects, which not only detract from the enjoyment of this game but also negatively impacted AAA game design for years to come. 

Anyways just watch the SMOSH song parody of the game instead.",1691625814,1692378013,False,3,2,0.516057074069976807,1,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

Review:
Assassin's Creed III aduce o experiență fascinantă în lumea Războiului de Independență a Statelor Unite. Cu o poveste complexă și un protagonist memorabil, jocul combină acțiunea asasinilor cu istoria reală într-un mod captivant.

Puncte forte:

1. Decorul istoric impresionant: Jocul reușește să creeze o reprezentare autentică a Americii din secolul al XVIII-lea. De la străzile aglomerate ale orașelor la peisajele pitorești ale pădurilor, fiecare detaliu reflectă atenția acordată istoriei și autenticității.

2. Personajul principal memorabil: Connor Kenway, un amestec între amerindian și britanic, adaugă o nouă dimensiune seriei Assassin's Creed. Evoluția sa de la un tânăr curios la un asasin hotărât este captivantă și te ține angajat în cursul acțiunii.

3. Mecanici de luptă și navigație îmbunătățite: Sistemul de luptă a fost revizuit, oferind o gamă mai variată de mișcări și abilități. De asemenea, navigarea prin mediu a fost îmbunătățită, permițându-ți să explorezi lumea cu mai multă fluiditate și ușurință.

Puncte slabe:

1. Probleme tehnice sporadice: Chiar dacă jocul în sine este bine realizat, există momente în care tehnica jocului poate întâmpina mici probleme, precum bug-uri sau anumite aspecte de clipping.

2. Ritm narativ neuniform: Povestea jocului poate părea dezordonată în anumite secțiuni, cu un ritm narativ neuniform între evenimentele dinainte și din timpul Războiului de Independență.

Concluzie:
Assassin's Creed III reușește să aducă o nouă perspectivă asupra seriei, transportând jucătorii într-o epocă istorică captivantă. Cu o poveste complexă și îmbunătățiri semnificative în mecanicile de joc, acest titlu este o alegere excelentă pentru cei interesați de aventură, acțiune și istorie. Chiar dacă întâmpină unele probleme tehnice și ritm narativ neuniform, experiența globală merită cu siguranță explorată.

I was first introduced to the franchise with AC III and Bloodlines (PSP), and I appreciate that Ubisoft remastered this game. However, please understand that this version is a REMASTER, and not a REMAKE. Big difference. As such, you cannot expect the gameplay to change much from what it originally was - the fact that they improved it as much as they did is quite surprising. You also cannot expect graphics on the level of Unity, or the later games. This is because the devs are working with the same engine as they did back in 2012, and to update that would mean recreating the game from scratch, at which point it steps into remake territory. 

That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with the improvements made to the game overall. The graphics look much better (although the character models in some scenes could do with some work), and the gameplay is less frustrating than it originally was. I am quite bummed that the story doesn't really change much, though that's really what's to be expected - This is a REMASTER, not a REMAKE, after all. I was also slightly put out by the lack of Steam achievements.

In summary, do not expect this to drastically change the older game - it doesn't. Do not expect gameplay on the level of the concept footage - it won't happen. DO expect a somewhat better visual experience, and less frustrating gameplay. DO expect a more seamless, less buggy version of the original.

Assassin creed 3 remastered.
Assassin creed liberation Remastered.
Assassin creed the tyranny of king Washington.
So its impossible to finish all of these in 11 hours. 

Firstly, assassin creed 3 remastered, The last game which talks about Desmond Miles. It had a bit different game play and the graphics are good in this one compared to the old. Even though i prefer the trilogy AC2 game play but this one isn't bad at all.
8/10.

Secondly, Assassin creed liberation, for me to be honest, it might be the worse one you can play. the game play is alright, at least better than the AC3 for a bit, but the story is so slow and poor, it feels like it was forced.
5.5/10

Finally, Assassin creed the tyranny of king Washington. It is just a short DLC for AC3. Its alright, if you wanna just cover your boredness you can play it because its too short. The gameplay was too weird, it felt like a fairy tail. 
6.5/10

In the end, I only recommend to play Assassin creed 3 and just skip the others.

Rating: ★★★★★

If you're a fan of the Assassin's Creed series, prepare to be blown away all over again with Assassin's Creed III Remastered! As a long-time follower of this franchise, I couldn't be happier with the care and dedication that has gone into bringing this classic gem back to life.

The first thing that struck me was the jaw-dropping visual overhaul. The attention to detail is astounding – from the intricacies of the environments to the characters' expressive faces, everything has been lovingly revamped. Boston and New York have never looked so vibrant, and the sprawling frontier is now a breathtaking wilderness waiting to be explored.

But it's not just the graphics that have received a facelift; the gameplay enhancements are equally remarkable. The controls feel smoother and more responsive, making the parkour and combat sequences even more thrilling. I was thrilled to rediscover Connor's unique fighting style, and the naval battles are an absolute blast with their revamped mechanics.

The narrative, one of the highlights of the original game, remains as engrossing as ever. The historical backdrop of the American Revolution is captivating, and the story's twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. With the Remastered version, the already engaging narrative is now supplemented by even more detailed character models and animations, further immersing me in this rich world.

The addition of all the DLC content is a fantastic bonus. I got to experience the intriguing alternate history scenarios of the Tyranny of King Washington, adding extra depth to the game's lore.

In conclusion, Assassin's Creed III Remastered is an absolute triumph. Ubisoft has truly outdone themselves by revitalizing this beloved classic. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a newcomer to the series, this remaster is a must-play. It's a nostalgic trip back to a pivotal chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga, now brought to life in stunning detail.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered breathes new life into the iconic 2012 installment of the Assassin's Creed franchise, delivering a visually stunning and polished experience that revitalizes the epic tale of Connor Kenway during the American Revolution.

The remastered version pays great attention to the game's visual fidelity, enhancing character models, environments, and textures. The result is a significant improvement over the original, with crisp details, improved lighting, and vibrant colors that make the game world more immersive and captivating. Players are treated to breathtaking vistas of colonial America and the bustling cities of Boston and New York, bringing the historical setting to life in a way that modern gaming technology allows.

The core gameplay mechanics remain faithful to the original, with the smooth parkour and combat system that the franchise is known for. Players can still enjoy free-running through trees and engaging in thrilling stealthy assassinations. However, the remastered version includes some quality-of-life improvements, making the overall experience more fluid and enjoyable.

The main character, Connor, is a complex and layered Assassin with a compelling personal story, grappling with themes of identity and justice. The narrative explores the turmoil of the American Revolution, showcasing the morally gray nature of the conflict and its impact on Connor's journey. The game's historical accuracy and attention to detail in recreating notable events and figures of the time add an educational aspect to the gaming experience.

The inclusion of all the original game's post-launch content, including the Tyranny of King Washington DLC, is a welcome addition to the remastered edition. These expansions provide players with extra hours of engaging content that further enriches the story and adds new challenges.

The remastered version also benefits from improved performance, offering more stable frame rates and reduced loading times compared to the original release. This optimization contributes to a smoother and more enjoyable gameplay experience.

While the remastered version breathes new life into Assassin's Creed 3, some aspects of the game may feel dated compared to more recent entries in the series. Certain gameplay elements, particularly the combat mechanics, may feel less refined compared to newer Assassin's Creed titles. Additionally, the pacing of the story and certain mission structures could have been improved to align with modern gaming standards.

In conclusion, Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered is a nostalgic trip down memory lane for fans of the original game and a fresh opportunity for newcomers to experience the story of Connor Kenway in all its visual splendor. The enhanced graphics and additional content make it a worthwhile investment, and the historical setting provides a captivating backdrop for an engaging and immersive gaming experience.

I miss Ezio and every element he brought to the franchise, but this game is worthwhile in a different way. First of all it's the final chapter of the Desmond protagonist in a quick and unsatisfying manner. Still, the modern story line throughout the rest of the game branched out from previous games and actually made me excited to leave the animus. In the revolution story line, Conner was a far less interesting character than I expected, and I really enjoyed my time playing as Haytham, or with him, significantly more. There is a lot of lost potential with many of the characters and overall the plot felt shallow. Enough of the negatives. Overlooking the downsides, the combat system was completely reworked in a very good way. It makes way for a lot more cool animations and keeps me on my toes, having to pay attention to who I'm fighting to change my play style accordingly. The parkour feels lacking with the loss of my hookblade, but the actual climbing style is a nice touch, appearing more realistic as a human scampering up the side of a building (If only the cities were more dense to enjoy the parkour). Most of all the immersion provided the aura of excitement. Having learned about the events of the Revolutionary War in history, here I am living vicariously through many significant events like the Boston Tea Party and the Battle of the Chesapeake. Would recommend playing and a worthy successor to pick up after leaving behind our beloved Ezio.

All this culminated into me playing the crap out of this game and man oh man i felt like i was actually living this game at that time. The story about the Ancients and the artifact and Desmond at the end was classic and iconic. Hands down this was the best assassins creed game in my opinion. Of course i played it originally on playstation 3 back in 2011.

I bought all the DLC and the DLC was even better. I love extra story DLC and i have never had a problem with paying for story DLC. I feel like its a good fair way for the developers to make extra cash by simply expanding on their work and offering players more content. Theres nothing wrong with that.

Really good continuation concept for the series but even with the remaster there are still some bugs and choppy transitions.

Again, they let interns design missions, like the Paul Revere mission where you have to cart him around, the horse cant fucking run with 2 people (shocking), and instantly aggros NPCs when the side objective is to not initiate combat.

This game design isn't challenging. It's tedious and annoying. I'm forcing myself to enjoy the game (sick and twisted I know) only because I can grab my phone and go AFK.

Assassin's Creed III to me always felt like a very underrated game in the series, and overhated as well. To me the story was very interesting from beginning to end (although somewhat depressing in certain areas). The American Revolution was a great theme and something I'm deeply interested as well.

The remaster leaves a lot to be desired though. To me the game looks and feels no different from what I played back in 2012/2013 and the game is still as buggy as I remember. There were a lot of points in the game where I got soft-locked and had to reload a checkpoint. If anything, this remaster feels like a way to re-release an older game for a 40 euro price tag.

But shoving that aside, the game itself is extremely fun and engaging. You get a lot of content with this remaster (the DLC + AC Liberations), it runs great on both my PC and Steam Deck, and in the end it's worth playing and picking up if you haven't done so already.

First, a lot of people disliked Connor after the charismatic Ezio. I won't lie, Connor is different enough to be pretty jarring, but he's actually a really interesting character for a number of reasons, and anyone who says he's dull doesn't understand the point of the character or his culture. Second, the game shipped with a bunch of bugs. Early patches fixed a lot of them, but some are still present. It's really luck of the draw whether you encounter one any more. I've played through four times, the only occasional thing I've seen is npc pop in. Third, the cities are laid out based on actual maps, making running over rooftops continuously more difficult. Personally I think it's cool they did something like that to make their historical representation more accurate. Fourth, they introduced new things that met with mixed reactions. They changed the way parkour works, they put in ship combat, and they put in tunnels to unlock fast travel. The new parkour is awesome when tree running, the ships are a cool experiment that gets even better in black flag, and the tunnels were at least fun for me, but I like mazes and puzzles and I guess most people don't.",1689314977,1689314977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is total nonsense. You can't counter properly, he'll keep hitting random targets or not hitting people at all. You cannot buy a better weapon till you progress in the story, Which, by the way, I was quite far through.
Rifles found throughout forts stay unloaded between reloads. The rewards from the Ubisoft club thing do not unlock until way late into the game. Trying to lure a whole squad of enemies over an exploding barrel and actually being able to free aim and shoot that barrel is a right arseache.

DO NOT BUY THIS. Just don't, You'll lose your mind with anger. I don't often get angry at games these days, but this one fills my stomach with a violent sputum that I just want to hurl all over the screen and hope it kills Connor.",1689164351,1689164351,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

The whole last part of running around the cave and watching cutscenes that I don't care about was so excruciating.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

To the point I looked up how many sequences there were to decide if I could put myself through the torture of completing the game like I really wanted to. I'd already decided I was doing straight main mission and nothing else to get through the game as fast as possible. BUT, once you get Ratonhnhaké:ton I actually pretty much immediately started to fall in love with the game. It actually opened up and turned into a *game* instead of the world's longest tutorial and the moral issues I'd had with some of the perspectives at that point disappeared. I'm enjoying a lot of things, but I haven't finished yet. I will edit again when finished.

Edit: Really loved this game overall. Honestly one of my favorites I've played so far. I absolutely love Connor and I love the perspective of this game and the way it doesn't sugarcoat history or glorify the founding fathers too much. 

Also really enjoyed Liberation. It was a quick, fun play, and I loved Aveline and the story. The optional missions were fun to do and the umbrella and whip were fun to play with. I also really enjoyed the Citizen E parts.",1685587517,1688096456,True,4,0,0.528349041938781738,0,True,False,False

First, buy this game in the bundle with AC: Odyssey, even if you don't play Odyssey it's still the better deal. You will have to open Odyssey first for the game to link to your Ubisoft account though, so just keep that in mind.

The first game I played was AC Liberation, which comes as a part of this bundle. Don't waste your time with this one, it's honestly just really bad. I went through and did all the collectibles and all the story and full sync and everything. It sucked. They had an interesting idea with the persona system which would be interesting to see come back. The combat was also good, but that's because it's identical to III's combat. The movement and parkour in general are pretty janky, and all the side content to this game is just not fun. The story is super flat too, the characters suck, and the plot ends without leaving any real impact on the player. DO NOT BOTHER WITH LIBERATION.

Here's the real meat; AC III is actually a pretty good game. The plot is pretty fun imo, and even a lot of the side stuff is relatively fun too, particularly the naval missions. Connor is a good character too, and Haytham is a badass. Desmond's real world sections are more action packed than in the Ezio Trilogy, and I found them to be very fun. The combat is awesome and feels a bit more polished (and easier) than in the Ezio Trilogy. However, it's not all good news. The parkour has been simplified, but somehow it feels like you have even less control than you did in the first games of the franchise, and it sometimes felt like you had no control in those. Like in all Ubisoft games, there's a lot of side content that just isn't that fun. Tons of collectibles, lots of exhausting open world challenges, full sync requirements that sometimes come straight from the pits of hell, and a LOT of bugs that weren't fixed from the original game despite this being a remaster. Overall, I wouldn't try to 100% complete this game, but it's definitely worth a playthrough.

Lastly, the Tyranny of King Washington DLC. Honestly, super fun and unique! My verdict is basically the same as with the main game, you should definitely play it but I would not advise doing 100% completion. I'd do the memory fragments to help better understand the plot, but don't bother going for the side quests (they can be kinda buggy and really boring) and don't bother going for the full sync requirements (although none of them are that bad in this DLC)

TLDR; Buy this game in the bundle with AC Odyssey. Don't play Liberation (it's bad), and don't bother with 100% completion for III or its DLC, but definitely play the main story missions and any side content that you find fun.",1687324236,1687324236,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

     - Solid conclusion to the Desmond Miles story arc (not the best but defiantly not bad)
     - Fluid and fun assassin's creed gameplay, up to this point it's some of the better implementation of it all 
        mixing a solid balance of the aggressive and stealth styles
     - Good amount of content, the original game plus the DLC is a solid amount to get through
     - Liberations is better than expected, not amazing and definitely could have been so much more, but for 
        what it is, solid
     - Overall a fun gameplay experience

     - The ""remaster"" part seems a little weird, some portions of the game don't look like much of a remaster 
        at all, some look better. This is definitely more evident when playing the DLC which seems to have no 
        been remastered? 
     - The DLC while solid, leaves a lot to be desired, the Tyranny of King Washington just feels like it's tacked 
        on and doesn't provide much there. As mentioned above, Liberations is decent to play through but 
        100% could have been a great entry and just never got fully realized
     - Bugs, nothing game breaking this time around, but plenty of strange ones. Most common was people 
        randomly walking backwards, and random visual glitches that fixed themselves when pausing and 
        unpausing
      - The story definitely gets a bit tedious, but still relatively satisfying when figuring things out
      - I feel there's a missed opportunity here to make the hunting a more involved piece of the game

Overall Assassin's Creed III Remastered is solid enough. The remaster portion means kinda little as it doesn't seem that upgraded or remastered from the original content. It's definitely slightly improved but nothing even close to ground breaking. The overall gameplay is good fun, it's Assassin's Creed after all and I think they did a great job once again of just making a fun overall game. The free running is still finicky but definitely a cool addition to add the more forested areas. 

At this point you're likely someone who's already played the first bunch of games and if that's the case, it's a worth entry to finish off this particular story line. It definitely could have been better. The bugs could be toned down, the overall story could feel a bit better paced and more involved, and I think there could have been a deeper dive into the Miles story line. Some of the gameplay just gets a bit frustrating but I think it's bound to happen in these titles. I felt like the first time around I definitely enjoyed every element of this game, but now experiencing it nearly 12 years later it just falls a bit more flat than I remember. Still overall a good and fun game, with a solid amount of content.",1686794929,1686794929,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

Despite encountering a handful of bugs throughout my playthrough, I still managed to have a blast with this game. The exceptional storytelling kept me engaged and motivated to push through these setbacks.

One of the major annoyances I faced were the NPCs occasionally getting stuck during tail missions. It could be frustrating to have to restart or find workarounds to progress, but the intriguing narrative helped me stay committed. The horse mechanics also suffered from some notable bugs, which could disrupt the flow of gameplay when attempting to ride them. These issues did detract from the overall experience, but they were not game-breaking.

My decision to play Assassin's Creed 3 was primarily driven by my desire to experience the entire series in chronological order. Despite the frustrations caused by these bugs, I'm glad I embarked on this journey. The game's strengths lie in its compelling storyline and the rich historical setting it offers.

Considering the bugs, I find it unlikely that I will revisit this particular installment. However, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try, especially if you're a fan of the Assassin's Creed series or enjoy captivating narratives set in historical periods. Just be aware that you may encounter some technical hiccups along the way.

Assassin's Creed 3 is undoubtedly a great game, marred only by its occasional issues. If you're willing to overlook these bugs, you'll be rewarded with an engaging experience that will leave you hungry for more of the series.

I have mixed feelings about this game because there were so many things to process:
  - Templar main character
  - Character changed to an assassin
  - I don't like the father-son relationship with Connor and Haytham
  - But Desmond and William's father-son relationship is great!
  - Boring sequence #4 and #5
  - I like sailing a lot (excited for Black Flag)
  - I hate Charles. I feel like he ruined this game.

Updated AC ratings:

> Assassin's Creed II: Exceptionally executed sequel, scoring a well-deserved 9/10.
> Assassin's Creed Brotherhood: Unfortunately, the multitude of bugs hampered the overall experience, reducing the rating to a 6/10. It's worth noting that in the absence of these issues, it could have easily matched its predecessor's score.

First of all, I love how the game will sound like salt and pepper unless i turn windows spatial sound on, and then off again every single time i launch it. I also find the 3-4 times ive managed to get stuck in between objects to be absolutely thrilling gameplay. But what really got me is that damn modern day cave vault door; the ONE thing youre supposed to care about as a player. ""What is this door? what secrets lie behind it? is there anything that can save us in there?"" which would be cool and all, except the door is actually invisible, just leaving the cave with this giant skybox at the ass end of the cave at all times. Yeah, its a petty reason, but if youre gonna waste my time with an 80% broken game, you can do me the courtesy of animating a blue fucking door properly.

Edit: I decided to play through and 100% every Assassins Creed, but after even further hours of play ima have to drop this one entirely. These bugs are game breaking at this point, a camera locked in place until my character gets attacked, jumping off of a moving wagon, and end up jumping 3.5 stories to the top of a building's ledge, even an invisible (and incounterable) ghost slowly hitting me to death.

Playing now, i truly wonder if its better at all than the og AC3, and in some cases even worse than i remember.

The upside, though, is how they revamped the combat system in this game. Comparing to its predecessors, the game is much more polished. Mechanics are better implemented, although it wasted all of our time practicing parkour with the W and right-mouse from all the previous games.

I played the original Assassin's Creed game of Xbox 360 and this game was my first attempt to play some of the older titles. Odyssey and Valhalla have been the games I'm more familiar with. 

Onto the game itself. Wow, the critics were certainly right about the main character of this game. Conner is one of the most boring and uninteresting characters I've seen in a story-driven game in my life. He is nothing but a plank of wood that speaks, he either has no emotion at all or is brash and angry, with no in-between or depth. When it comes to the gameplay, there is definitely some left to be desired. I personally struggled with the social stealth mechanic, however, there were certainly times where the enemy detection was quite ridiculous and unfair, especially on the medium difficulty. 

When it comes to the word 'Remastered', they used it quite loosely, the main differences is just an updated lighting engine and upscaled textures. The models have absolutely no change in terms of polygons and the faces are still quite rough around the edges, quite literally. I would've liked to have seen a bit more when it comes to the remaster, even if it meant adding in some stuff from the other games that came out after, such as making the naval combat more similar to Black Flag which is, to some, more superior than this game's is.

Summary:
Assassin's Creed III is the fifth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, developed by Ubisoft Montreal and released in 2012. Set during the American Revolution in the late 18th century, the game follows the story of a new protagonist named Connor Kenway, also known as Ratonhnhaké:ton, a half-British, half-Native American assassin.

The game begins in the 18th century, where a Templar named Haytham Kenway travels to the American colonies to retrieve an artifact that holds great power. He establishes connections and forms alliances, ultimately leading to the birth of his son, Connor, with a Native American woman named Ziio.

As Connor grows up, he witnesses his village being destroyed by colonial forces, leading him to join the Assassins in their fight against the Templars. Under the guidance of his mentor, Achilles Davenport, Connor trains to become an assassin and seeks revenge against those responsible for his people's suffering.

Throughout the game, Connor becomes involved in significant events of the American Revolution, including the Boston Massacre, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the signing of the Declaration of Independence. He encounters historical figures such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson.

Connor's primary objective is to find and eliminate Templar targets who are manipulating the conflict to further their own interests. These include Charles Lee, a high-ranking Templar and the main antagonist of the game. Connor's journey takes him through various cities and wilderness regions, from Boston to New York, as he uncovers the Templars' plans and attempts to prevent them from achieving their goals.

As the story progresses, Connor discovers the existence of an ancient First Civilization temple and a grand conspiracy that spans centuries. He must navigate the complexities of the war and confront the ethical dilemmas of the Assassin-Templar conflict.

Assassin's Creed III combines elements of open-world exploration, stealth-based gameplay, and historical fiction. It explores themes of freedom, justice, and the blurred lines between good and evil. The game received positive reviews for its immersive world, engaging storyline, and innovative gameplay mechanics.",1589557780,1684497358,True,20,0,0.599636971950531006,0,True,False,False

After looking up other reviews, both here and on other forums I've concluded that this particular version on steam is the actual problem.

I feel AC3 is starting to become more appreciated these days. I like the setting, Connor as a character and a more ""grey"" story. While the remaster is simple cash grab, it's definitely worth it if you get it through the Odyssey edition.

[h1]Story[/h1]
[list]
   [*]The first 5 hours or so are you playing as Haythem Kenway, coming to like him and his companions, especially Charles Lee. I appreciate what they have done here as I've gotten older. Showing you a different point of view of the world.
   [*]Essentially a second prologue takes place when you swap to the actual games protagonist, Connor or Ratonhnhaké:ton, his actual name. This feels tedious, and you essentially get taught how to do all the same stuff as you did with Haythem.
   [*]I like Connor as a character, he's Stoic, Stubborn, and focused. Which are traits he shares with Altair but he is also Naive, inexperienced and bitter, which it makes sense considering what he experiences through his life.
   [*]Instead of creating a brand new story in a historical setting, Ubisoft has essentially forced these characters into well known events, while being really cool to witness, it's awkward and makes no sense, especially for Connor. 
   [*]Scenes were Haythem and Connor are together are by far the best in the game, they challenge each other and are a great dynamic.
   [*]Modern day, has us continuing right off the previous games, and to be honest i did not like the direction it headed. Desmond's story did need to end, that was a given, just the whole premise of it felt rushed.

[list]
    [*]Animations for parkouring look so much smoother and fluid then what we have had in all the previous games and It all flows nicely together. Unfortunately, it's not utilised well in the game, it's quicker to just run in the streets most of the time then go via rooftops.
    [*]Connor has the ability to jump through trees, which is a really cool addition, it makes sense with his character as well. 
    [*]Certain open windows and doors you can run through which will show a little in engine cut-scene of you passing through the building, it's a cool way to get around when needed.
[/list]
[b]Combat[/b] 
[list]
    [*]Has phenomenal animations, tools can tie into executions as well, and pulling off a multi-kill execute is amazing. Connor feels powerful and ruthless, while still feeling nimble.
    [*]Massive array of weapons. From his new signature weapon, the tomahawk, to war clubs, a bow, guns, swords, with even more to buy/craft and pickup.
    [*]It does feel way to easy to combo executions, and with large icons appearing above enemies telling you exactly what they are going to do, with ample time to respond you never feel truly in danger.
[/list]
[b]Stealth[/b]

    [*]New assassination potential with the rope-dart while in trees, corner assassinations, and being able to crouch in low bushes and move around.
[/list]
[b]Questing/side content[/b]
[list]
    [*]Hunting has been introduced with the ability to track, bait, snare and take down animals, even having some ""legendary"" animals to take down which make for some neat sequences. 
    [*]The ledger is a new feature where you can buy/sell resources, craft new equipment or upgrade existing gear. I barely touched this feature, the menu for it is awful and most of the time you sell things means you have to run across the map just to save the convoy.
    [*]We are introduced to Naval battles and these are short and sweet, have a clear objective. They give you a taste of what's to come in Black Flag.
    [*]Peg Leg missions are some of the best in the game, they have you go off and exploring a completely new environment. Feeling very Uncharted/Tomb Raider like. 
   [*]Homestead missions are great and shouldn't be missed. Each character is unique and completing them also shows a different side to Connor. The more of them you complete for each character will unlock more upgrades/craftables based on that characters respective trade. Completing them will also visually add to the homestead. 
  [*]You can recruit members to the brotherhood as well, but it's done in such a cool way. Each one you recruit is a unique character with their own story, and ability. Once you recruit them they will actually show up in story sequences.
  [*]You get to play as Desmond and go on actual missions, but outside of the skyscraper one they are mostly pretty boring sadly. 
  [*]Assassination contracts are boring and have you running across the map just to kill someone that's walking around, and they all look the same.
  [*]Liberation missions have you completing a bunch of the same tasks over and over again depending on the area. It get's tedious pretty quickly.
  [*]Forts are a pretty fun experience, take out the leader, blow up a cache and replace a flag. It doesn't feel like there is to many of them and they are all different and allow you tackle them how you want.
  [*]Of course collectables are back and starting to get very obnoxious. Although i do always enjoy being able to collect outfits and weapons. It's everything else that can feel like to much.
[/list]
[b]Difficulty[/b] 
[list]
    [*]This game is by all means not hard, it gives you plenty of tools to get by and enemies make their actions clear.
[/list]
[b]Length[/b] 
[list]
    [*]16 hours just for the story, i did just about everything, aside from the DLC and spent 25 hours in the game. I imagine 30 or so hours with the DLC content.
[/list]

[h1]Visuals, Audio, and Performance.[/h1] 
[b]Visuals[/b]
[list]
    [*]With the remaster, characters faces have lost all detail, faces are smooth and just bright, it looks genuinely awful.
    [*]The environments in the open world look stunning, especially with the weather system and having seasons actually change.
[/list]
[b]Audio[/b]
[list]
    [*]Assassin Creed games never fail to disappoint when it comes to the soundtrack, picking up and creating tension, and drama when needed, or slowing right down to give you that ambient backdrop as you explore.
    [*]Audio in general is done really well, marching bands, animals, cities, and gunfire all draw you into the game.
[/list]
[b]Performance and Bugs.[/b]
[list]
   [*]While being capped at 60fps, it runs well. No bugs either.

I loved Assassin's Creed 1 through Revelations but I have to actively force myself to play this game since it's really frustrating. I probably won't cover everything that bugs me about this game but I will cover most things that truly ruin my experience.

I AM PLAYING THIS GAME WITH A PS5 CONTROLLER CONNECTED TO MY PC VIA CABLE. SOME OF MY ISSUES MAY OR MAY NOT APPEAR FOR M&K PLAYERS.

The camera: For some reason the camera in this game keeps on focusing on useless stuff that you don't even want to look at. The camera then locks itself and you're unable to move it for around 1 second which get really annoying once you need to do some stealth climbing. And if the camera manages to move through your input, it just focuses on the next point of interest which is often up to 180° away from the point you were trying to look away from. Small camera adjustments are almost impossible to do which makes navigating horrible.

The combat: Overall combat feels nice, but sometimes the indicator to parry just doesn't appear or appears too late which makes it impossible for you to do long combos of killing. Also the ""human shield"" mechanic when you're being shot at also seems to work only 25% of the times you're trying to do it. 
Then there are the quick time events. When you're traversing the wilderness a lot of wildlife keeps interfering with you, which wouldn't be a problem if the quick time events would actually work. It isn't a hardware problem since my controller is working fine in any other game other than that one. When you get attacked by wildlife I press my button to parry but it doesn't work and when the wildlife pins me to the ground and I have to spam-click a button to free myself it also only works about 10% of the time.

The missions: Oh god the missions. As someone who loves to 100% games this game really is a pain in the ass. Go on and tell me it's a ""skill issue"" but in my opinion there is a fine line of ""challenging"" and ""stupidly hard just so the player has to reset 30 times"" which this game managed to overstep by a wide margin. 
The other AC games had their fair share of challenging mission if you were to try and 100% them but so far the only mission that really made me ragequit was the Da Vinci's tank mission in AC brotherhood but for some reason AC3 managed to make every other mission a chore to 100%.
""Go on that boat and make it go boom. Also don't get seen by a single person on the ship. Oh and also kill a grenadier through an air assassination but good luck getting to the high ground because the enemies can see you wherever you are! And don't bother trying to kill one of the four grenadiers in a different way because as soon as you kill one of them you lost the challenge!"" This mission was so utter bullshit that it was my wake up call that maybe I shouldn't try to 100% this game. I tried and tried and tried and even watched a YouTube video where someone managed to do it but I just couldn't get it to work. Was it a skill issue? probably. But IMO you shouldn't make such bullshit missions in the first place. Remember what I said about the camera? When you're trying to climb up the ships (you need to do it twice) the camera just keeps focusing on the wrong point and makes you jump somewhere you didn't even wanna go. To make things worse sometimes your character decides that he doesn't wanna climp anymore and just starts standing on some invisible ledge on the ship which in return makes you visible to the enemies. 
Just everything about that mission was so utterly frustrating that I even considered skipping this game entirely and just moving to Black Flag since I really wasn't having any fun at this game.

The bad camera paired with quick time events that only work 50% of the time and a mediocre story which isn't even fun to explore since the missions are designed badly make for a experience that really isn't worth the price. The only reason I haven't skipped the game is because I want to see the ending of the Desmond arc by myself and I don't think it's even worth it.",1682937177,1682937177,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll admit though that I'm coming from later games in the series and that is probably why I'm having such a hard time getting into this game. For a ""Remaster"" it doesn't seem to really update anything to put it in line with more modern AC games and bugs that were in the game 10 years ago are still in this so-called remaster; how is that even possible? I've counted at least 5 or 6 bugs I looked up online where the threads were from 10 years ago. One of the most annoying aspects of the game is the combat. Enemies fight like trained ninjas blocking at least half your attacks and they all take too long to kill. And kill streaks constantly get interrupted. One of the worst things is hacking at a Hessian soldier 20 times only for him to grab your arm and slap your face. That's what this games combat feels like: A slap in the face. Another thing I hater is the environments because in many places you're surrounded by mountains and trees that cannot be climbed. That makes exploration extremely difficult and time consuming since you wander the maps looking for ways to move vertically. And don't even get me started on the horse riding. If I didn't know better I'd say this game invented the horse riding mechanics because it's just so terrible. Again, how is this a ""Re-Master""?  If the game was going to fix anything it should be the horse riding. The horse oftentimes moves slower than you running, the ""Spur"" command only works for a few seconds and for some reason the horse will just...stop for no reason. 

Another problem are the aforementioned bugs. I've had to restart just about every mission, especially the numerous escort missions (I assume this is the game that spawned a lot of the memes regarding escort missions), because either someone gets stuck and doesn't movie or a random NPC or animal knocks them into some water or off a cliff or something and they die. Even the very last mission in the game bugged out on me. Twice.  The usual error I've run into is reaching a specific point in the mission and a cut scene fails to trigger. 

Finally, there's plenty of minor tweaks they could've added to the remaster that wouldn't have taken any real work but would've improved quality of life. For example why not have Eagle Vision actually highlight stuff? There's a lot of hunting in the game but unlike AC 4 using Eagle Vision doesn't highlight animals. And it would be nice if there was some way to tell what can cannot be climbed. As I said earlier there's so many cliffs that can't be scaled despite all of them having some sort of objective on top of them. Eventually you'll come across a place you can climb but it's never obvious.

All in all I'd only suggest this game for true fans of the series. Otherwise if you're a casual AC fan like me stick with later games in the series.",1681051576,1681648308,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I also never realized that Achilles, the old man who trained Connor and the person who gave him his English name, named him after his dead son.

Так, графіка виглядає трохи краще, і вони зробили бій трохи більш плавним за допомогою кількох додаткових комбо, але це приходить із випадковою зміною кольору AI, не дотриманням шаблонів мовлення та випадковим відходом під час розмови під час місії, і ви будете fail bc ""ПОПЕРЕДЖЕННЯ ЗМЕНШИТИ ВІДСТАНЬ ДО ЦІЛІ""
2.

ДЯКУЮ UBI за це!! Я знаю, що не всім подобається ця серія Assassins Creed, але як великий шанувальник цієї серії ігор, я просто мусив пограти в цю. підвели масово.

Truly the next step in advancement, Assassin's Creed III is a beautiful game, full of advancements in the series. The story is probably one of the most rich in terms of twists and turns, that it left me unable to predict where it would move next.
Took me roughly 70 hours to 100%.

Assassin's Creed Liberation Review:
A much shorter Assassin's Creed game compared to all others in the saga; however, I truly believe that because of the shortened length this game is, it has received a ton more polish. Experience ""flowy"" combat unlike any other of the Assassin's Creed games, and a story not unlike Assassin's Creed III's. Out of all the games prior to Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, this is the greatest.

AC III itself is a fine enough game, with a refreshing take on the AC formula, with many high highs (e.g. the combat) and a few low lows (e.g. the stealth).

[b] First few words [/b]
I see most people not giving actual reviews to this game but giving warnings about how to purchase it the “right way”. I’ll get into that at the end but for now I’d like to give my take on the game itself, gameplay, bugs, and ofcourse the steaming pile of crap that is the remastered edition.
This game was amazing, it may not beat the megalopolis that is Black Flag or Brotherhood, but it does okay.

[b] Story (Spoiler Free) [/b]
It’s one of the best I've ever played, up there with greats such as the GTA Series, Mafia Series, Red Dead Redemption Series, etc. Hell, even God of War. The writing, as in pretty much all AC games, is nothing but stellar. It’s only enhanced even more by the game changing performances of the actors. They are so good at the roles they play that I just want to jump into the screen, enter the AC3 world and have a chat with them. Honestly some of the most believable performances in gaming, up there with Roger Clark as Arthur Morgan.

Though the story may be a bit slow paced, and I do admit it could’ve been sped up a little. It doesn’t stop you from feeling the emotions of the characters. The story is long so you can feel, bond, and attach yourself to these characters, making for a better experience.

It’s a very serious and dark story, that of the likes of GTA IV. Granted, we may not be meddling dope and doing odd jobs for multiple crime families in search of the lost diamonds. But we are however in search of freedom, freedom for Connors people to be treated like normal. The type of freedom that says the American Government can’t take the land we rightfully own. [spoiler] If you’ve played the game already you’d know this didn’t work out [/spoiler]
It’s a very sad and gripping story that latches you into the world the moment you meet Haytham. You play as Haytham Kenway (Edward Kenway’s son) for around 4 - 6 hours give or take, depending on how much you grind the story missions. During this time you learn about the character and the many people he surrounds himself with. One being Charles Lee, I won’t go into detail because you’ll have to play the game for yourself. 
Once you’ve finished playing as Haytham Kenway you’re immediately dropped into playing as Connor (Ratonhnhaké:ton) A child living in an Indian village with a mostly carefree life, but that all changes after a Hide and Seek game with his friends goes wrong. You play as Connor for the remainder of the game and play as him from childhood to early adulthood. In this timeframe of 23 years you watch him endure pain, grief, and rare strokes of happiness. On the other side of the spectrum you see him commit acts of Murder to those who “deserve it”. Justified or not, it serves as a major point for growth in his character, and it succeeds very well at doing so.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
The gameplay is the typical Assassin’s Creed style of gameplay. (excluding the reboots of course)
Your typical, [i] Go hear - follow this person/travel somewhere - gather information/eavesdrop on conversations to garner a location of a target - find that target, kill them (you made endure a chase sequence) move onto the next mission [/i] Of course I am exaggerating, but that’s only the jist of a very small portion of the game.

Your primary weapon is no longer swords but rather a hatchet. Hidden blades are still in the game of course, along with many variations of guns. You may still take enemy weapons if you so desire.

[b] Bugs [/b]
Unfortunately being a Ubisoft game, comes with an incredible amount of unpolished material. I won’t go into the details but more so mention the common bugs that can occur so you may avoid these.
A lot of glitches occur with[i] wanted posters [/i]. Typical things that may happen are posters not disappearing when incognito, getting stuck on walls when interacting with posters[i] (fast travel to escape)[/i], posters that cannot be interacted with despite indicating they can be, etc. Honestly the list goes on.

Other encounters can be the following, during brawl sequences in missions, after defeating all enemies the game may not realise and keep you in the sequence, allowing you to move around but unable to progress.
Animals and NPC’s having a brain freeze in their AI and getting stuck and multiple objects and places of scenery, Trees, Tables, Barrels, etc.
Floating Objects such as, Cannelballs, debris, apples and other items of detail.
Mouths not moving and audio and sound effect may not be synced or not be there at all.
Invisible walls being misplaced during missions.
Some objects are not solid whatsoever and NPC’s will walk right through those objects. I once watched a redcoat walk straight through a table like he was a ghost or something.
You get the point, there are a lot of bugs and glitches that can occur in this game and unfortunately Ubisoft decides to ignore it, even in the “Remastered Edition”. Yes, at this point bugs are kind of a staple for the AC franchise, but too many just really get on your nerves.

[b] The Remastered Edition [/b]
There are so many things I could say about this, so many uses of profanity, so much to say, but really it’s boiled down to one thing. [u] Greed [/u]
Ubisoft is by far (maybe) the most money hungry, stingy, greedy, arrogant, and brainless company in the history of gaming.

I’ve been playing the AC franchise for as long as I can remember, (ever since I watched my Dad play it when I was like 4 or 5) and to play this ""remastered edition"", is nothing but pain and a chore. Ubisoft forces their TERRIBLE launcher upon you, without which you cannot play the game. 
Here's a pro tip for anyone making a game. If you decide to put your game on steam, LET STEAM TAKE OVER! Don’t try to create unnecessary garbage to ensure you get an extra dollar. Unnecessary garbage that us as gamers have to keep on our desktops downloaded at all times.

To revive an almost decade old game, put in some brightness and “improve” graphics on an already stunning game, yet don’t do a single thing about the bugs, whilst slapping a $60 price tag on it, and also removing the original version from anyplace it can be purchased is a really scummy move by Ubisoft. The Graphics make the game look extremely glossy in a way. You’ll see what I mean just by looking at any of the character models in the game.

[b] This game gets an 8/10, the remastered edition gets a 3/10 [/b]

[b] P.S. [/b]
Here's the bit where I talk about the right way to purchase this game. Assassin’s Creed Odyssey Gold Edition comes fully kit with AC Odyssey Gold Edition of course, but also copies of AC3-Remastered and ACLiberations-Remastered.

TOP 3 FUN THINGS TO DO:
⭐️Exploring the 18th century.
⭐️Battling in ships.
⭐️Doing more than just the main story.

THE UNIQUES:
💎The SHIPS!
💎Great 18th century vibe.
💎Native Americans.

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼Open World.
💼Assassin.
💼Parkour.

VERDICT:
I received this game from purchasing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, it's certainly the weakest one I've played to date and I can see why a lot of people gave it a negative review but does it deserve all this criticism? They've polished the game in terms of graphics but left some bugs lying around which can frustrate you during any kind of mission but it didn't ruin my gameplay in the slightest. A lot of other reviewers are saying the game isn't playable which is NOT true, the parkour isn't as good as the previous game but they've improved the open world and added ships which has to be the best side of the game.

The story to this one doesn't even touch the sides to the previous titles which is a huge let down in my opinion, the DLC story was better than the main story, I hope this isn't the ending for Desmond Miles or else i'm gonna be PISSED!
Total Score = 76/100.

Assassin's Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. It is the fifth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and a direct sequel to 2011's Assassin's Creed: Revelations.

	As in most games, you use right click to aim, and left click to shoot (talking about using a bow this time), but after the arrow shooting animation ended, it immediately send an input to start the assassination of the nearest target, despite me not touching the keys anymore.
______________________________________________________________
-Poor Optimization
	On a PC with RTX 2060 and Ryzen 7 3700X, the 1% was around 50 fps, altough everything was maxed. (not using an ultrawide monitor)
	(The 1% in games is a measurement about those extremely low fps you get every once in a while in game, as games are not made uniformly, some levels, graphics, mechanics, etc are different in every part of the game)
	For a 10 year old game that didn't get as much of a glow up for the remastered version, but a minor upgrade in graphics, this is poor performance.

The main plot is also good.
Gameplay is quite good and also has few bugs:
- horse control mechanism is quite stupid, you will easily get stuck on rocks or trees :)).
- there was 1 time cornor died and the game reloaded with cornor dismounted and in the tree :)) --> of course I can't control except dismount :))
- cornor is very strong but 0 must be invulnerable as rumored :)) In the sequences after there are more types of soldiers you will use more buttons!
- ubisoft should separate the flute and other features out. For example, you can actually climb the wall while sniffing the flute -_-.
- the missions are easy but some missions will be hard to achieve 100% sync (like every other assassin creed -_- ). Sometimes side objective is created to make it difficult for the player (maybe some stupid programmer thinks it's fun :) ).
- This game has the bad eagle vision. When enable it, I can't see the map. everything is gray, no animals, people (except enemies) are highlighted in very faint blue.. It help a little but almost poor. I think Connor is very good assassin because he can't need poor eagle vision to kill enemy.

- DLC washington provides very cool skills. But I find it much more prone to bugs than the original game :(.

Many side missions are very good and do not repeat:
- Davenport homestead gives a warm feeling, people seem to be really living, working, interacting, going to sleep (unfortunately it repeats the next day :)) ).
- hunting and exploration missions are also very nice.
- I like ship battle (but Black Flag do this better), hunter (better than Black Flag).
- Common man is very suck, it took of me 4 hours! I don't know what is funny with this type of missions. Many activities are only scanned in the summer :)) Many activities are rarer than others and you should do it as soon as you can. It will take you many hours to complete after the main story is finished :( (don't be like me).

Some stupid missions:
- try scanning Common man every time you start the game :)).
- the rock climb in new york underground never work with your guide move, you need tell user more control keyboard.
- homestead stop the fight, it is very suck and make I hate this game.
- win mini game: the easiest way is to play ball with the lumberjack. Don't try other mini games, it will take a lot of your time and energy (unless you like it because the AI is pretty well programmed to win you at every board game :( ).",1672585897,1674835063,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
The interactions between Haytham and Conner were really well done.
Ship combat was an amazing addition to the franchise.

Cons:
Both the modern and the animus stories were incredibly boring.
Horse riding in free roam was a good addition, but stumbling over every rock got very old, very quickly.
The game took WAY too long to get to the good stuff, and the good stuff was incredibly short-lived.
I'm a history geek, and I still didn't enjoy their version of the American Revolution.

This game for me is the definition of mediocrity. 

I found myself bored or annoyed almost the entire time playing. There were some objective improvements of many AC mechanics, but even though I really tried liking this game (as the AC community gives it a bad wrap), I can't in good conscience say I recommend it, or that I will be revisiting it in the future.

Overall, a 5/10, wouldn't recommend.

- The reflex shots using pistols and the bow and arrow

Performance: 
Game is poorly optimized. I constantly fight with bugs glitches fremedrops. My gpu is like 40% occupied and takes like 20wats and the game drops to 45 fps.  And yes i did this whole troubleshooting with affinity and priority each time i started the game. Didnt help much. 
Story: 
The story of the game drops right after you played this first character (no spoilers) which is so awesome and is the best character so far. Conor main character is so unlikable and boring. The story is so lazy written when it comes to details. ex the first armor is with feathers and is indian style done. Like someone knew that conor would be indian. Realy the setup in the world is so good. 
Summary:
This game would be a 7/10 if the game would not fight all the time with you. its like 4-10. If you would like to learn that the faar better character is taken right away and replaced with something sooo boring you would not even care. Then go for this game. If you like boring fights which mostly are kill steak chains... this is so boring. And the bodies... and the bodies fly up like rackdolls in glitches constantly to the sky. Is this a remake? Go AC1 and fight some guards. You needed skill. And here you just block counter kill chain... and everything looks.. nice but it glitches during an automated sequence where the player can just click X to kill chain again and again. Not even that works. I cannot go further and am quiting it now. Will watch the story on youtube and play the next game in the series: AC4 BF. Dont buy AC3R.

I heard that there is a lot more bugs on this version, however I only experienced a few at the end. So, I will pretty much just do a review in my current style.

I first heard about this game/franchise from Smosh's AC3 Rap, I apparently liked that song back then (I don't know why either) then I saw some gameplay on Smosh's gameplay channel. I really started to like this game, because I am a history buff and more specificity American Revoultion history buff. So, this game was perfect. I didn't get to play it until much later. The gameplay is very good classic Assassin Creed Gameplay, with even more social stealth. Connor's outfit is amazing and I don't know why we haven't seen it since Unity. If you love Classic Assassin's Creed get this game.

This review is a little weird for me to write. ACIII was my introduction to the series and growing up it was one of my favourites, and I didn't understand why this game got such a bad rap. But playing this ""remaster"" really put into perspective how undercooked, janky, unfun, and sometimes downright unplayable it is.

Let's get the good stuff out of the way first. The story is pretty good, with some really emotional moments and impactful storytelling. The modern-day component is also a lot more interesting, as Desmond actually gets to go out and do stuff. The characters are great, with ACIII even providing probably the best villain in the entire franchise. I also really love the time and care Ubisoft put into portraying the Kanien'kehá:ka (Mohawk) people and having characters speak the language, hiring a cultural consultant to ensure that the details were right. The movement system also got a much needed upgrade, completely changing how your character moves parkour-wise like allowing him to climb through trees, and introducing the ability to make running kills, making everything much more fluid and intuitive. The switch to arkham-style combat may be a bit simple, but the combat animations and finishers are extremely cool and stylish. The soundtrack is also one of the best if not the best in the whole series. 

Now the bad. ACIII feels like a mishmash of game mechanics that really feel out of place and are essentially pointless, stretching the game out to feel like an incoherent experience. I have only engaged in the hunting system in the tutorial and never again. Same with the convoy trading system. The assassin management system seems really tacked on and could be missed by most players. The naval missions, while fun, are also stuffed in some menu that could be missed by many players. Even certain weapon types feel gimmicky and unusable in most parts of the game. A lot of the side content is literally reduced to a list of challenges, making this game a completionist nightmare because there's so much boring stuff to do. There are also a bunch of optional objectives for some of the missions that are excruciatingly difficult to achieve, sapping the fun you may have trying to complete them. It really feels like the devs threw as much ""content"" as they could into the game to distract people from how undercooked and unfinished it felt. I had very little actual fun playing this game, and when a game makes you feel like you're working rather than enjoying yourself, something is terribly wrong. 

The presentation side of things is also extremely sloppy. The dialogue audio is very low quality, clothes clip through characters even though that's the only set of clothes they wear the entire game, and the lip-sync and animation quality for some side conversations and missions are absolutely horrible, just to name a few. It could just be the setting which I personally have no interest in, but I found the cities and locations featured in the game to be unappealing and monotone. The quality of the game varies dramatically, almost as if multiple different studios worked on it (hmmmm I might be onto something there). 

ACIII is also definitely the buggiest game in the series (yes, I'd say even more than Unity). The bugs are too many to name, but it includes dialogue overlapping and cutting in and out, looping music that also gets progressively louder to the point of deafening noise, NPC pathways just bugging out, flickering screens, incompletable objectives, and so much more. I've had to reload saves countless times, and the bugs in general detracted from the whole experience significantly. I don't think I've ever stared at my monitor in bewilderment and threw my hands up while playing ANY game as much as I did while playing ACIII.

Now, the remaster itself. The only thing I can confidently say that this remaster does well is make the environment look better, with more vivid colours and much better textures. That's it. A lot of people talk about the overhaul of the lighting system but I think it made things worse: some scenes are nearly pitch black or blazing white, and characters look like smooth wet plastic dolls. And seeing as this remaster really made me realize how buggy this game was, bugs were not fixed, and even perhaps new ones were introduced. 

In addition to the base game, this package also includes the ACIII King Washington DLC and AC Liberation HD. The DLC is good; it has a fresh story and introduces some fun new abilities, if at the cost of recycling locations and repetitive filler content if you choose to do it. AC Liberation HD is a pretty solid short game that honestly seems more coherent and polished of a game than ACIII, with a really interesting and unique ""persona"" system and creative ways that the story is told, but some of the repetitiveness of the side missions and collectibles (if you wish to do them), awful framerates in certain parts of the city, lack of musical variety, and frustrating objectives needed for 100% sync hold it back from being a standout in the franchise. 

[b] TLDR; While getting some things right in the story and parkour/combat department, ACIII feels like an undercooked and bloated mix of different game mechanics rife with bugs and issues not at all fixed by this ""remaster"", which made some visual changes that make this game even worse. AC Liberation HD Remastered is a really nice inclusion in this package but it has a few (admittedly more minor) issues that hold it back from being a great game.

AC3 Remastered, I enjoyed and I loved the change of date covering the time of the American Revolution. Whilst not all the new introduced mechanics I enjoyed such as the crafting, there was plenty I did like due to my love of that particular time period. The story was good and the axe and use of muskets and pistols was fun.

Washington DLC. I didn't really enjoy this dlc. The whole dlc is based on an alternate timeline/reality and for me it just didn't work, but its worth playing just the story and not bothering with collectables etc.

AC Liberation, I really didn't enjoy. I realise it was made for the PS Vita, but it didn't engage me storywise the whole 3 outfits mechanic didn't for me add anything other than annoyance and I honestly was playing this just to finish the game rather than getting any enjoyment out of it.

What makes me angry about the UI: It is so cluttered that I don't recognize when vital feedback and tips are displayed.
What makes me angry about the gameplay mechanics: I never have the feeling that i'm an adequate asssassin, being able to stealthily use my environment and surroundings to my advantage in order to dispatch my targets and get out unscathed. Brutal overt offensive works better at too many times due to the lacks in stealth gameplay. (Rhetorical question BTW: Why is it called Assassin's Creed?)
But maybe I shouldn't expect a Dishonored or Thief. And maybe I'm too tired of Open World-style gameplay with parts of the game locked behind gazillions of collectibles just to stretch playtime.

AC 1 gave me the most fun, the fun to have in all the following games fizzled out around the edges of their bloated content.
Dear Reader, I'll invite you to tell me that I'm wasting my time with these games in the comments

[original review follows:]
I have only bad experiences with this game and I didn't even enter the tutorial course and anything that will come after it:
My wired Xbox360 gamepad is not recognized (it works absolutely fine in AC:Odyssey and RDR2, just checked) .
To start AC3:Remastered I had to register it in Ubisoft Connect. To register it in Ubisoft Connect I first had to download 80GB+ of AC:O and start it once.
I've spent two evenings of my precious time just for the above.
Cannot recommend and strongly advise against until Ubi comes forward with a better way.
[update 2021-04-27]
Ubisoft provided me with a solution to my Xbox360 controller issue:
manually edit Assassin3Remaster.ini in the \Documents\Assassin's Creed III Remaster\ directory and replace the [input] section with

[Input]
SelectedPad=XBOX 360/ONE For Windows (Controller)
KeyboardMouseEnabled=0
AutoSwitchEnabled=1

Works also in the original AC3! I'm going to play some more (at least the main story) before I come back and eventually change my verdict.

Update Jan 2023: Nope, the only reason for me to play on is to progress in the AC lore. There's nearly nothing else for me in this game.

Sadly, that is where the good parts end.

The combat is janky, some attacks simply can't be mitigated because the indicators don't show up and with that you're unable to parry. Sometimes inputs get flat out ignored. Fighting near cliffs is dangerous as the animations may cause you to roll into open air - with gravity kicking in once you've left the animation.

The menus are the most horrendous style choice I've seen so far.

Buttons like 'B' on the gamepad are overloaded with context sensitive commands while other like 'Y' on the gamepad barely do anything.
E.g. B is responsible for:
 - interacting with objects
 - starting quests
 - looting
 - picking up
 - dropping weapons
 - parrying
 - whistling

Y is reponsible for:
 - reloading
 - shooting

Stealth is abysmal - sometimes guards see you through walls, other times you kill the person next to them while looking them in the eye and they do nothing. In one mission I've had a whole group of guards follow me around without doing anything - no matter how many people I killed.
It also seems like guards automatically know where you are if you're wanted and exit a hiding place. I can't imagine how else a mob of guards would immediately sprint to the other side of a building.

The game keeps spawning enemies in in your vicinity while you're wanted, making hiding and fleeing extremely cumbersome and not fun.

The boston underground was fun for the first half but got just tedious and annoying very quickly.

The climbing is definitely the worst in the entire series. In the few cases where it works it feels good - but I've never had that many ledges where the MC just refused to climb further or where the AI just decided to jump somewhere else entirely.
In the frontier a couple of the synchronization points are the _same_ tree over and over - this tree is terribly unintuitive to climb and feels like it was specifically designed to be terrible.

The list goes on, but I'm not wasting more of my life on even writing the review.",1672485061,1672485061,False,2,2,0.514056205749511719,0,True,False,False

The only positives I can think of are the voice acting, the homestead, the music, and the nature. Conner is a fine character but due to his stoic ass-holeness he is not that likable.

Meanwhile, the nature parkour is buggy at the worst times, the AI is broken (elk can't see you 1 ft away yet guard can see you while his back is turned), the combat is buggy with indicators showing up after attacks or not at all, the in-cutscene graphics are horrendous (lee getting his ring), and the majority of the new mechanics are uninteresting or unnoticeable.

I wanted to like this game. I *really* wanted to like this game. My HUSBAND wanted me to like this game.
And it started off so well, with so many improvements over the previous games. Weather animations and animals in the world and i could PET the ANIMaLS. And it had a lock that kept me from jumping off cliffs while I was running through the trees. It even told me how many damn sequences were in the game so I knew how far along I was. All awesome things!
A native american main character, and actual native languages being spoken throughout the game? Absolutely incredible, I was so excited!
Plus the game was gorgeous. I'd seen a bunch of people complainin that the remastered version was pretty much no improvement for a lot worse lighting, but to me it looked awesome!
Other nice points:
-Actually lets you return to the game after it's over so you can finish grabbing collectibles.
-Checkpoints actually work now for getting full synchs.
But then...all the infuriating things about it started overshadowing the pretty, sleek, interactive parts.

I literally have so many issues with this game that I can't possibly fit it in a review.
To attempt to sum it up;
-Contradictory and confusing characters
-Horrible running mechanics (too slow by far, and spurring your horse is disabled whenever you're in a 'city' even if you're on the outskirts where it's nothing but fields and hills and no fast travel points.)
-[bold]Horrific fighting mechanics [/bold] ENemies coming in wave after wave with limited ability to kill streak and the E key needing completely abused to survive any of it, since the only healing is time-based.
-Zero exposition or reasoning for 95% of side quests. Kill dog. Kill person. Deliver mail. Collect item. No purpose or meaning to it.
-Quest markers and collectibles markers that just break and stay on screen when there's nothing there, or disappear without letting you get to them. I was going through the epilogues and it told me one was in boston. I go to boston. No more quest marker. Guess it's over?
-Extremely repetitive gameplay (gives you an entirely new city to start from scratch in when there's only 3-4 sequences left in the game)
-Homestead missions and outfits and gear are extremely sequence locked, pretty much completely unavailable until sequence 7.
-Tons of glitches, as always with ubisoft. Got stuck in walls, and it rained indoors. Animus notifications were borked and constantly threw old information at me like it was new.
-Inflammatory characters whose sole purpose seems to be being a jerk. And im not JUST talking about shaun, though he's obviously the biggest culprit.
-Constant lack of proper explanation for how to actually accomplish objectives. ""Follow me to this tunnel to avoid the guards"" character is following YOU and there are no directions except an objective marker.
-Homestead convoy premise was grindy, boring, and not worth the money it made you, plus upgrading the homestead made everyone ELse's homes look better and expand, but did nothing for your own house, which looks barely lived in right up to the end.
-Bizarre controls for everything from fighting to calling for your horse
-Stupid mistakes with voicovers and cutscenes, even for main story stuff that cut off speakers or started them midway into talking, and voices in side-quests that randomly got far too quiet, or Connor just began shouting his lines as if he thought u were across a field from him.
-Meaningless scenes treated as vitally important. The whole naming scene is completely pointless. He's supposed to take the new name and pretend he's spanish so people actually listen to him and dont realize he's native american. Except then everyone in the game knowws he's native american, and they never even bring up the 'spanish' thing again. so what was the point of the new name?!
-Even the guy whose entire introduction is about how minorities deserve more respect, flat out refuses to attempt to pronounce Ratonhnhaké:ton's name. Didn't even TRY. wtf. The only person who ever cared what it even was was some random dude named Duncan in a bar in Boston. He made a whole point about it, and then Still didn't say it.
-And most importantly, i nearly broke my stupid pinky holding the shift key for the entire game. It was agony compared to just holding right-click, as weird as that control was. :(

TLDR; I wanted to love this damn game, and it just didn't happen. If you want an assassin's creed game to play, I just can't recommend this.

After playing the old one (since I havent completed the first and second AC Ezio Trilogy) feels this has better parkour mechanics but sometimes the control is bad.

The graphics better than the original, sharper, more color, and more importantly the lighting is better than the original. The mechanics was also revamped, you can now whistle behind your hiding spot like AC4.

Some QoL also improved, like some sound effect from animals, even crying babies. It also gave some atmosphere when you're in prison, that the prison is place you dont want to go.

Connor is a badass but sometimes also idiot. He learn so small until the end.

Found some music bug sometimes when Synchronize, the music from Synchronize didn't stop and repeat.

Not yet finished the Liberation packed inside this game, only the first Sequence. So far not really have good impressions for me personally. Some of the mechanics are somehow revolutionary (especially the clothe change, like Hitman series), lil bit shame they did not bringing that to their next game.

All in all the story is pretty great; the way it flows through the immense history of the American Revolution is impressive. However, the game-play is utter garbage and buggy: 
First, if you happen to exit the game during a cinematic there is a good chance the next time you log in to play it will crash every time and that save will be ruined- it happened to me twice: once early on, and another halfway through!
Next, the combat system is not well refined; here's some examples: The warning icon (letting you know an attack is incoming) does not appear multiple times during engagements causing you to get hit or shot when if it would just appear when it should you would be fine. It's so bad I've learned not to rely on it, and I'm sure most have too. When an enemy is about to shoot you: you have the option to use a nearby enemy as a human shield, but half the time you press the button and your character will just break the defense of that enemy or do nothing -SERIOUSLY-
Still on the topic of combat; Animations: This one isn't as big a deal as the rest, but it's worth mentioning that the animations for the daggers are the same as the tomahawks?! They are completely different weapons yet you will see Connor awkwardly hacking enemies down with a skinny little knife; it just looks horrible, again not game breaking just lazy on the developers part.
Parkour: Oooh now this is a big one. The parkour in Assassin's Creed III is ""wow"" bad. You have significantly less control over your character's actions than in previous AC games. Even after spending a few hours mastering the movement system of AC III you will still find yourself jumping all over the place, and jumping down instead of out, climbing up instead of passing over, glitching sideways and grabbing onto a random wall 6 feet away instead of running straight?? I've heard from a few sources that the parkour had an update a couple years after release that jacked it up, but this isn't a review of the way game was, it's a review of the way the game is. Now I will admit that Ubisoft added some cool new parkour features such as the room traversal cinematic or the slick passing over animations (which as previously stated don't always work), but that's not enough to make up for the rest of the sh** we put up with.
Missing missions: When completing a sequence (such as Sequence 7 or 9) certain side missions will become available to you, however if you happen to complete another sequence before those side missions those missions will disappear! And no this isn't a feature most players never experience this bug but it does happen sometimes and it is definitely game breaking. Not only do you miss out on some good content, but you need these missions to craft and unlock certain items, such as weapons and capacity upgrades.
I could honestly go on about various other things, but I said this would only be a 2-3 minuet read. I truly hope this review helps you and it is very disappointing to me that a game with such great potential has so many issues. I hope you have a great day and find another way to experience the story like through a cinematic montage off of YouTube or maybe a Let's Play; that way you can get the full story of this amazing franchise.

Then, yes, get this game.
I believe I got this free with the Odyssey bundle a year or two ago. The ""remastered"" version plays worse than AC2 ever did for me. Buggy and glitched. I just left when my char got stuck in a doorway. I was hoping by Chapter 2 the pace would pick up. It does not. 

Edit: I played up to chapter 7. The pace does pick up (I'm being generous when I say that). I'm like ""oh maybe I can finish this story!"" I like completing games. I started playing a mission where you need to escape on horse. The horse literally FALLS OVER every 3 seconds, even when there isn't a shot fired by the enemy. The gameplay gets even worse as you need to actually, you know, do stuff. 

It's not just that we have higher standards today, but this game came out bad, they polished the turd, but it's still just a turd. If anyone at Ubisoft is reading this, when you go to ""remaster"" a game, don't just sharpen the graphics, please make it run a little better. Or just leave it where it needs to be.

1) Amazing main story.
2) Best side missions in the franchise. I really liked how we develop our village, how characters came to village, their stories and our interactions with them. It was so good that after completing the side missions you get connected to the characters. Whenever I came back to homestead after missions, it truly felt home cuz we saw it grow.
3) I loved the hunting missions (don't like hunting in real world though), they were challenging and sent you on different beautiful locations.
4) The graphics were superb and hence the maps (my fav were frontier and homestead) were really pleasing to explore. Also, the weather and time changes of day added to the pleasure.

the game is as broken as i remember as well as infuriating i would not recommend playing the game unless you are wanting to follow the story of Desmond 

my biggest gripe of the game is how sticky the climbing feels i grab on to everything but what im trying to climb on and when get to where I'm needed to get to i feel it takes way longer then it needs to 

the combat is very repetitive and i have not bought any upgrades to weapons or firearms then what was given to you at the start of the game, i don't even think i ever even went into the store except for the one mission you have to in the beginning of the game

the towns and the side missions seem pointless and don't have any feel to them, the towns seemed crowded more of redcoats then the npc that ""live"" in them 

the redcoats seem more aggressive then any of the other enemies in the past games which feels annoying and takes away from the game as a whole you feel like you are punished when you climb on top of the buildings like you have for the past games, because the redcoats are so quick to notice you

all in all i was kinda wishing for more when i heard assassins creed 3 was getting remastered but once again i was let down again,

my only highlight from finishing this game in 18 hours is that now i get to go and sail the 7 seas as a dope pirate

The reason is that the advantages and disadvantages of this work are particularly outstanding. Its plot and task settings are the top level of the whole series. In addition, it also has a large number of feelings bonus - it is Desmond Saga, the end of the Desmond saga. In the early generation, the Akalin protagonist, who was hated by all the players, fully demonstrated his personality charm and even became the hope of mankind. This work is also the beginning of the North American trilogy (liberation is 0.5, rebellion is 0.5, which adds up to just three), and it is also the beginning of Ubisoft blurring the position of the Temple and the assassins, and abandoning the previous binary opposition between black and white. There are two chapters in the game when Connor and his father sea cucumbers act together. Although they also have resentment, they have a lot of conversations and are trying to understand and protect each other - just like all the weird, ordinary and touching feelings of father and son in the world. The similar feelings were used by Yubi in another very unfortunate work two years later. There, the temple and the assassin once again had a chance to bridge the gap between them. 
However, the end was still a disaster, and a pair of miserable mandarin ducks were buried with them. Many of the plots in this work can only be understood after playing with the later works, especially the master of the manor, Achilles. When I first played, I only thought that this was an old man who was making a fool of himself, just like the master in Chang'an Chaos. But after playing mutiny, I realized what kind of past he carried in every word. In the mansion of Davenport Manor, Shea once left his footprints, probably also left his laughter with his brother Liam, his roast about the serious Indian Kensegoworth, and his vague affection for Hope. In 1781, the man ran on the streets of New York for his great goal. Twenty two years ago, Shea ended Hope's life in the same street after a close pursuit. So far, the North American Brotherhood was nearly wiped out, leaving only Liam and Achilles who were desperate. Hope's mansion was destroyed by the fire in New York in 1776. In the same year, Shea went to Paris, ending the life of the old Dorian and the childhood of the young Dorian. Since then, Shea has also embarked on the journey of looking for the artifact everywhere, and has hidden himself from history. In 1781, when the man set foot on the land of New York, time seemed to have erased the traces of these predecessors. This is a connecting work in the plot. It is more obvious to play again now. This is the greatest part of AC3.
 In addition, this is the most abundant work in the whole series, without doubt. In addition to the main line, there are two secondary lines. One is the obvious home task, and the other is the obscure and weak sense of regional liberation task. The doctrine of assassins has been the tradition of attacking strongholds since the Brotherhood, but this work has split the stronghold invasion and attack in the Brotherhood and the Revelation into a series of regional liberation missions focusing on dynamic tasks and fortress invasion missions focusing on sneaking in, which is quite an interesting attempt. My personal evaluation of this attempt is still good, but it's a pity that this method has not been continued. However, considering the map of Heiqi, it is probably impossible to do so.

However, the awkward aspects and shortcomings of this game are also very prominent. Compared with the above feelings, it is quite a bit of sugar and shit. I don't pay much attention to the image quality, so I don't think this copy is too difficult to accept. But in fact, as far as the host platform is concerned, there is no improvement compared with the original version in 2012. No matter how touching the above stories are, they will be discounted with their rough pictures and weak expressiveness, especially when I played the Odyssey six months ago. This work also has bugs, but they are not fatal. Apart from the fact that I had to reopen because the farmer was stuck in a tree during the homestead mission, I didn't encounter any major problems. So what became such a controversial masterpiece? Personally, I think it is mainly because of two awkward points and one really bad point. One of the two awkward points is the strange feel of this work. The combat feel of this game is probably the most weird and difficult to grasp in the whole series, especially compared with the first three games. The main reason here is that the feedback after the player presses the key is very long, that is, the man's action animation after the player presses the key is very long, which makes it difficult for the player to grasp the time to press a key. At the same time, the enemy's offensive desire is also stronger than that of the trilogy period, and they will also compete with players for frames. Therefore, players are easy to be beaten if they don't grasp the key timing properly. In addition, this action has reduced the player's attack power. Even if it is an ordinary soldier who directly attacks the weakest, the man will have to cut for half a day. The significance here is that every time you cut a knife, the player has to press the key once. The more keys you need to press, the more likely the player will make mistakes. In combination with the extremely long animation, the timing of the keystroke requires completely different counterattacks, weapons unloading and blocks. In addition, the players' active defense breaking and throwing skills make the changes in the rhythm of the keystroke very complex. In addition, the offensive desire of the soldiers is much higher than that of the trilogy era. The combat difficulty of this work is actually much higher than that of the trilogy.This combat system was finally polished after the mutiny (in fact, the three generation climbing system is also), so the sense of mutiny is the best in the North American trilogy. So maybe someone will ask: Since that man is not very hard and the fight is more difficult than the previous one, why is this one so famous? The answer is simple, because it is very difficult to sneak in, especially when fighting blockhouses. Oasis has a song called Don't look back in anger. Although the life I want more now is the title of their other song: The importance of being idle.",1670809738,1670809738,True,1,0,0.506578981876373291,0,True,False,False

I have a special place in my heart for these shitty games but I will have no nostalgia for AC3.

Where to start... ugh, ok, the price tag. They still want to charge $20 for this I guess because it was ""remastered"" in 2019, although that doesn't mean much and the game is much older. I am not even sure why this qualifies as remastered other than maybe some slightly smoother graphics and better lighting? idk, I actually didn't play the original so whatever. And it almost NEVER goes on sale even when all the games after it are 75% off, so they are really proud of this crap for some reason.

The game engine is unchanged from 3 games prior and somehow actually worse. The fighting is terrible but stealth also doesn't work because the environment and controls are so damn finnicky and buggy you have no idea what your stupid wooden character is going to do. It's an all around mess to be sure.

The only saving grace this game has is the naval combat, which you can easily skip out on in lieu of playing the much more polished AC4 which is a masterpiece in many ways. All in all, save yourself and skip this one.

Стал проще в управлении. Теперь можно с легкостью с дерева на дерево прыгать. Добавили механику кустов. Очень помогает в преследовании. Появился животный мир, правда особого смысла в нем не вижу, так затрагивает частично сюжет, ну а так в целом для лутеров или убить время. Прекрасно реализованы времена года, сразу чувствуются сугробы при передвижении. Можно заниматься мореплаванием, что очень доставляет. Увы экономические сделки здесь хромают, очень слабо, проще сундуки лутать. По поводу Liberation: является неким комбо 2 части и 3. Где вновь доступны магазины, которые можно купить. Механики торговли намного интереснее реализована чем в 3 части. Покупай новые корабли, отправляй грузы в другие города, получай прибыль и по новой. Увы в 3 эту штуку убрали. По поводу оружия для Эвелины отравленные дротики это основное оружие для дальнего тихого убийства при помощи трубочки или зонтика, есть еще дротики-берсерки. У Коннора же больше лук, хотя присутствуют ядовитые дротики но это больше все же ножики. Шэнбяо - самый интересный инструмент 3 части, при помощи него можно легко подвешивать жертв на какой-нибудь ветке. У Эвелины аналогом есть кнут, который так же можно юзать в битве, но подвешивать на нем нельзя, зато можно прыгать дальше цепляясь за ""специальные балки, лианы, ветки"". Животный мир в Liberation также есть, но не такой богатый как в 3. Есть механика каноэ, такая же как и во 2 части, увы 3 лишена такого. Ну и следует отметить главную механику этой прекрасной игры - переодевание. У нас есть 3 личины: ассасин, госпожа, рабыня. Каждая обладает своими преимуществами и ограничениями. при этом рейтинг обнаружения у всех разный (но заметьте для ассасина всегда рейтинг 1). Также рабыня при переносе ящиков и бочек получает инкогнито. Возьмите на заметку. По поводу графония и звука во всех частях все нормально, ""не вырви глазно"". Что по поводу багов и вылетов? Увы Liberation в этом плане проигрывает. Есть и то и то, также немного технически недоработанное управление. Также пропадает при каждом запуске звук диалогов, мне приходилось перед запуском удалять файл options чтобы послушать озвучку, а то как-то не камильфо, рот открывается, субтитры идут, а звука нет. В 3 части намного лучше, хотя тоже баги есть, при чем в отличии от Liberation немного бесячие (например, я застрял в дереве и пришлось грузится с контрольной точки). Кстати для Liberation придется выучить английский или сидеть с субтитрами, тут русской озвучки не завезли☺. По поводу сюжета. В обоих случаях наши герои хотят добра и делают все на максимум, чтобы дорогие им люди (индейцы или чернокожие рабы) были свободны. И каждый в своей очереди сталкивается с тамплиерами и их взглядами, немного бунтует против философии своего наставника. И мне реально нравится наблюдать над этим, что у них есть свое мнение. А теперь детальнее. Коннор (Радунхагейду) по подсказкам Юноны находит старого ассасина, обучается и по списку пытается их всех уничтожить, даже своего отца. Все клешировано, но довольно интересно, есть поворотные моменты, которых никак не ожидал. Но не забывайте, что здесь главным героем также является и Дезмонд. Концовку которую, как по мне, слили. Может бюджета не хватило. У Эвелины - ее история, является игрой, а точнее воспоминания Объекта 1, которые ""изменили"" и представили перед публикой. Но ""хорошие"" хакеры решили взломать игру и выдают в определенные моменты правдивые сведения, для активации нужно просто убить цель ""Э"", как простой триггер. И все скрытое станет явью. В конце концов мы тоже убиваем тамплиеров (но не по списку), а как это было во второй части. Начинаем исследовать, искать. Кстати в Liberation попытались немного усложнить механику детектива, где кроме следов можно изучить улику и восстановить цепочку событий.
Как итог, мне обе игры понравились, оценочки для AC3 - 8.3 из 10, ACL - 8.7 из 10 ( было бы выше, если бы до ума довели бы техническую часть.",1670510943,1670510943,True,0,0,0.479041904211044312,0,True,False,False

this one is annoying for a lot of aspects
- the protag assassin making dumb decisions basically from the start to the very end, so much that you truely hate him for how naive he is, naivest MC i ever seen in a game
- the game decides the worst path in front of you to jump or climb, your worst enemy is the game
- optional objectives suddenly pop up on intense moments, and you might not notice it till you find out you failed it. then you battle yourself to either ignore completion or redo the whole mission 
- the remaster did a lot of AI, movements and timings wrong
like enemies spotting you when there's a lot of things in between you two, or from a huge distance
-optional objects had tight timing in original
this remaster makes them almost impossible, unless you repeat the section for an hour until you magically complete them
and sometimes the optional has a change to occur
like objective might be something the enemy should start, like enemy attack or shooting, or a very specific part of ship gets destroyed, and you need to repeat the section again and again till it happen
and sometimes starting from checkpoints takes 4 second of the tight timing you had, at start of load.

this is the first AC game that was against me having fun
5/10 because it's still an assassins creed game, not a RPG with minimal AC elements",1670431726,1670431726,False,9,2,0.529102981090545654,5,True,False,False

-Remastered version really did improve the graphics.
-Combat is satisfying.
-Good story. It has many flaws and irrational scenes but overall good story.
-Connor is a badass. He is the one man army, the terminator, the destroyer. (except sometimes he acts like an idiot)
-It is the first AC game that introduced the Naval battle and it is good.

Things I don't like: Oh boy, Oh boy...
-Juno looks so creepy I shit my pants. 
-NPCs are so stupid and obnoxious. It seems developers didn't really care about improving their AI. 
-Parkour is bad but still better than latest RPG ac games lol. But still controlling is bad.
-I just didn't have any feeling or urge to play the side missions. They are boring as hell I just decided to rush main story
-Stealth is very bad. It's better to just march in and slaughter everyone.
-Upgrading, Crafting weapons are kinda useless cause you can just one-shot enemies with counter attack.
-Sound of this game is terrible. The fighting and the sound don't match. FUACKING stressful music plays every time you get in a combat. Yeah I give credit for them adding sound to every single detail of the game like dog's barking, people talking, people working etc. They tried to make the game to feel alive but AI is so fvcking stupid it doomed the atmosphere of the game forever.
-Desmond's character design is so badddddd, man WHY! just why UBISOFT! I'm sure Desmond doesn't deserve that.
-A lot of bugs.
-Same textures are just copy pasted over and over again.
-Juno's character design is so terrifying, I couldn't sleep at night. 

Overall: 6.3/10 Would recommend it if you are AC fan or starting to get into Assassin's creed games.

The story in general is, however, quite fantastic, if not one of the best in the series. The ""villains"" are much more complex and ""gray"" than they were in Ezio trilogy, each with backstory and goals that are not entirely unsympathetic. The homestead and its side missions was a great feature most players likely ignored that really filled out the story and made it all feel more alive and dynamic.

It also brought so many new things to the series after a relatively stale previous entry (Revelations). The tree parkour, rebuilt animations, the new combat system, the ship combat, animals, and so on. The Remastered version here too got a lot of negative attention due to a select few scenes getting a lot of attention where one could argue the original looked better, but by and large this is the definitive version with far superior lighting and improved mechanics (you can now whistle from hiding places, like in Black Flag, for example).

I remember loving that game and the same for the second. I distinctly remember on Christmas day opening this game up for my Xbox 360 and playing the game all day long. I can remember everything from that day, the sights, smells, and feelings of warmth and happiness. To my delight when I first popped this game into the disc tray and played it I felt transported in time. I truly felt like I was Connor, and I felt like I could see the sights taking place in the game as if I was there and the same goes for the sounds etc. I think this game is easily IMO the best Assassin's creed game. To be fair I only have dabbled in the games after this one. Anyone is certainly welcome to argue with me and I am sure they will have their valid points. To me this is one of those games that you never forget. It is a game that you can lose yourself in and never get bored of and if you do you will inevitably find your way back to it just like I did.

The story line is brilliant as always and with a new protagonist to run around revolutionary america. Lots of new mechanics were added to this game and so is very different to the Ezio games.
Some mechanics are really great and fun like being able to steer a ship and using the rope darts and blow pipes. Hunting and skinning animals were an added touch that worked really well with the native american overarching story. 
Free running became a lot easier somehow than previous titles and made the whole running and jumping from one thing to another far more fun than before.

Also big shout out to the davenport homestead. The homestead missions were brilliant and you feel like you're part of a community, it really is a joy to watch the village grow.

The fast travel underground was definitely a weird take on the fast travel mechanics and after spending a couple of hours fleshing the whole map i definitely needed a nap, they could have made it more interesting.

Now to the bad stuff. I absolute can not stand the long riflemen. They are certainly one of the most annoying aspects since the arrival of the gun, they can spot you a mile off and will annoy the heck out of you, definitely one of my more hated newer elements to the series. 
Another one i misliked was the almanac pages. My god i hate running after these sods and then you just happen to jump at a wrong angle and you've fallen and lost the page.
Finally the battle missions were just rubbish i didnt care for using cannons to kill oncoming armies, i didnt care for dodging behind one rock then another whilst an army is firing towards me and i definitely did not care about ordering a firing line at an oncoming army. it just sucked and didnt feel very assassin like and more like a general or officer of the patriot army.

I remember the first time i played this i enjoyed it a lot more than i did this time round. With some mechanics being downright annoying it really knocked my nostalgia. However despite that there was a whole bunch of new mechanics that really felt true to the assassins and to the expansion of the universe.

Lastly, i have to say the game is easy to play(mostly) and i enjoyed yet another assassins story [spoiler] and for a time a Templars[/spoiler] However this was the last game in the Desmond arc and i was very sad to see our modern day protagonist leave the franchise.
[spoiler] I was sorry to see you go Desmond but you'll live in our hearts forever and thank you for saving our world. Laa shay'a waqi'un moutlaq bale kouloun moumkin. [/spoiler]

Liberation
It's definately an inferior title to the previous ones. 
Swamp environment filled with trees did not fit the franchise at all. 
No fast travel to synchronised locations is a bummer. 
It leaves the player with constant rowing, swimming, running and tree climbing. 
Although it's interesting to play as a female character, the whole slave theme did not win me over as it was used before.
I wouldn't reccomend it. 

Ac3
It does add to the story as a whole, hence why I would say It's worth playing if you don't want to miss out on anything. 

However I have to add that I did not enjoy the game itself...
Compared to other AC games it somehow felt clunky? The MC moved slow even when he ran. 
It's the only AC game that sat on my backlog and I had to constantly force myself to play it.

Gameplay is fluid, the plot is somewhat cinematic. The difficulty is just right (not hard, not always a cakewalk), but some parts can be pretty challenging if you go after 100% sync.

The graphics is nice, music is forgettable, but not annoying. Main character is rather naive, voice acting could've been better, IMO. It's okay, but I liked the main villain more, to be honest.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience. Especially after getting through some of the hardest challenging objectives (also known as ""optional if you don't care about 100% sync""). Almost done with achievements (they're not available in Steam, only in Ubisoft Connect).

It's ugly to look at;
Character models look like clay or plastic Barbie dolls;
Character model eyes are detached and soulless in almost every scene;
The Ubisoft Club outfit fittings for Connor is horrendously out of proportion with his head either looking twice the size of his body or in some scenes the outfit completely affects the face animations and makes his face look like its glowing;
Some Club items still do not appear in game even after reset (have not attempted re installation);
Some cut-scenes are broken, where it is like you got hit with a flashbang just as it started and it does not go away until you exit to main menu and return to the game;
The game is even buggier than the original! How can you make a remaster that is in worse shape than the original??? You just had to make the game actually look good and you could barely even do that!; 
Assassinations from bushes are bugged to where Connor either no longer blends whilst crouched or just refuses TO crouch in order to blend;
Enemy pursuits are broken with random enemy NPC pop-ins around every corner essentially making it much more of a pain and hassle to reduce notoriety;
Missions bug out frequently with kill targets, followings or tailings not being tracked properly or accurately displayed;
Random de-synchronisations after fast travelling to a mission location and stepping a few feet away from the location you spawned at;
Counter indicators tend to not show, counter actions are randomly cancelled out meaning you still get hit after pressing the button, and chain kill attacks are bugged where it stops Connor mid animation;
Performing too many dynamic actions like sprinting, attacking and twirling weapons causes Connor's arms to become straight and stiff to where it looks like he is just using the power of his mind to defeat enemies;
At the Battle of Moulton Hill there is no greater demonstration of awful remastered graphics than here, with the 'gruesome' scenes ending up looking hilarious rather than SOMEWHAT brutal. A soldiers blown off legs look like low poly bread sticks dipped in comical ketchup and another soldier's 'burnt face' just looking like the guy tripped and fell into mud or brown shoe polisher which just made him very very shiny.

I have played the original since its release back in 2012 on the PS3 and have beaten the game at the most, 3 times. I enjoy the story and the combat has always been fun. But this opinion stays true to the original. This so called 'remaster' has caused me more f&*$£@g brain trauma from the sheer overwhelming issues than if I were tackled by Shaq whilst he was wearing Spartan armour. 

Do. Not. Buy. This. Unless you got cash to burn because it is on a very high sale, just use the money to buy the original game and then mod it or something. I got the AC Odyssey Ultimate Edition, thus receiving this for free thinking it was a pretty good deal, but now having played and tried it?

I'm a hardcore AC fan and take it from someone who's been playing AC games for a log time, this game is great!
here are some key points to be noted about this game.
- This is the first game in the franchise to experiment new combat mechanics implementation.
- This is the first game in the franchise to use new game engine
- This game is the reason AC games have NAVAL COMBAT!!!
- This is the first game in the franchise to try new navigation mechanics.
As you see this game was an experiment ground for the devs to lay out the foundation for [b]Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag[/b].
Black Flag is just a better polished version of this game.

So there were bound to be a a lot of bugs and From the points of Customers I can understand the frustration. 
but if you can look past the plastic looking face models and some silly bugs that makes you wanna smash your keyboard a few times It's a beautiful game with lots to offer.

The story is beautiful.
The character development of Ratonhnhaké:ton and Achilles is wonderful.
the game environment feels smooth with  the new parkour mechanics. sure it removed the agency over manual complex parkour movements like in the previous ac games but feels more cinematic and the transitions are way smoother.
Combat is now also cinematic that changes the game-play experience from previous ac games.

LOOK, if you're gonna keep comparing this game with Ezio triology to meet your expectation then you're going the wrong way.

[b]Comment:[/b]
[b]AC3:[/b]
This review is about changes from the original, that review is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/artibius/recommended/208480/]HERE[/url].
You still play as Haytham and Connor. Haytham's part has been limited as the collectibles and side missions were reduced. Chests are distributed along the chapters and not all at once. Visually it is better in some regards but not the characters. They became too waxy and/or mannequin-like with eyes looking like glass. Improvements were done for icons and fast travel in Homestead and most other areas too. UI looks smoother. Multiplayer has been removed but apart from the Wolfpack mode it was not that great anyway though some people may miss it. Playing it a second time to 100% (kill me) I realized why the only parts from AC3 that are memorable to me are the Desmond & Homestead parts. Because the constraint are so damn glitchy, difficult and downright annoying in some missions ... that you just focus on the objectives instead of the stories. Especially because checkpoints are made by Satan himself so the game saves just as you fail an objective so you have to replay the entire memory. Epilogue was slightly changed, it removed some vital info/closure for Desmond's memory. But here is where the issues start: Store icon bug (icons are swapped, the ones you visited will say 'Not visited' and vice versa); Almanac pages not showing up so you chase the icon. The same glitchy AI plagues the game; Final Desmond cutscene glitched and did an Alt+Tab; And many MANY more. Considering I write this 1 year after the remaster came out I doubt they will still fix some stuff. Possibly it would have been better to make a GOTY version where they fixed all the bugs and glitches. Instead they remastered the visuals but left all the issues from 2012 still in there...

[b]AC3 - Tyranny of King Washington:[/b]
Reviews of the original DLCs: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/artibius/recommended/227130/]The Infamy[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/artibius/recommended/227131/]The Betrayal[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/artibius/recommended/227132/]The Redemption[/url].
Looks better, just like AC3. Thankfully bundled so you avoid the DLC store mess the originals had. It is still as difficult as the original though, to 100% it you will do missions over and over. Same bugs are still present, unfortunately. Like ""Chain 3 Eagle Flights, twice"" constraint working properly only with gamepad. Or convoys not having prisoners in Boston (you need to exit the game and load it again). Or when a selected weapon is not being used, just fists instead. Or falling through the world map if you air assassinate from a certain angle. Or that sometimes it doesn't allow you into tactical mode in the damn checkers mini-game. And finally, the game behaving weirdly with heavy weapons and their chests after every mission or save load (removing the weapon and showing the icon again). This DLC was a hot mess when it came out and it remained that mess even when remastered.

[b]AC3 Liberation Remastered:[/b]
Review of the original version can be found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/artibius/recommended/260210/]HERE[/url].
Definitely more visible graphical and movement improvements than in AC3. The UI is much smoother and the areas had much more life added to them. Probably the combat and parkour had the best rework. Bayou had added light but it is still just a bunch of shades of brown, even remastered. It is a terribly designed area that you have to endure without any fast travel options, even remastered. The collectibles also don't stay on the map once discovered, only when you are near them. The cutscenes are skippable now and trade system has been fixed. Side objectives are still not viewable on main screen (need to open map for that) but this is a problem of the series. So this remaster threw a new coat of paint but left many of the issues. Unfortunately, one of the new things added are also compatibility issues. The ""Your connection to the Ubisoft servers has been lost."" message appears with start of the game (but uPlay rewards and achievements still work). Exiting the game also always crashes the application. By the way all of the DLC and uPlay unlocks are still present.

[b]TL;DR:[/b]
Overall, if you take quantity over quality approach there is a ton of content here - all the items, DLCs and AC:Liberation; so you can spend plenty of hours playing this game. And because they removed the original AC3 this also is the only version that you can buy to finish Desmond's story. [b]So, while I give it a thumbs down, I'd say the best way to get this is to [u]acquire it via the AC Odyssey - Season Pass[/u][/b] (you need to install and activate that in uPlay first before starting AC3) or a super deep sale if you are a fan. Otherwise just ignore this game entry, it is a disappointing remake that had potential but squandered it and is not worth the money...

[b]P.S.:[/b] [u]uPlay unlockable DLCs:[/u] Alexios' Outfit (skin for AC3), Arno Dorian's Outfit (skin for AC3), Bayek's Outfit (skin for AC3), Edward Kenway's Outfit (skin for AC3), Ezio's Outfit (skin for AC3), Jacob Frye's Outfit (skin for AC3), Shay Cormac's Outfit (skin for AC3), Pirate Armor Pack (2 weapons for AC3; 1 weapon for AC:L), Initiate Pack (1 mission for  AC3; 1 mission for AC:L), Assassin Pack (1 naval mission & 1 pistol for AC3; 1 weapon for AC:L), Master Assassin Pack (1 naval mission & 1 skin for AC3; 1 weapon for AC:L), Extra Tool Pack (upgrades for AC3 and AC:L), Obwandiyag's War Club (weapon for AC3), Upgraded Naval Convoy (naval upgrade for AC3).

Crap mechanics, the Charles Lee chase through the ship bugged and I always fell to the sea for some reason. Fixed it by restarting the game.
The games crashed multiple times per session, the cutscenes were bugged.

Now story-wise I did not connect with Connor and his story. The Desmon mission saving his father was completely unencessary and could be done another way. 
Really predictable story with little entrigue. I did however liked how Connors and Lee's story ends.
Desmond story? Meh... 

==============================
Original review:
I am still going through the game but I had to already not recommend it.
There are many graphical glitches (as shown in my screenshots) It's taking me out of the story. Also the voice actors for the native scenes are really rubbish or I am just no acostumed of their way of speaking (keep in mind I'm from central EU).

But the visuals are amazing and the towns are beautiful.
Climbing trees is bad - several bugs and glitches. The stores are several menus and submenus? Who designed that.
The ""mini-games"" during main missions are bad and uninspiring.

What I thought was the best AC when I was a kid turned out to actually be the most boring one. The stealth seems overlooked, and the naval combat is just plain not fun in my opinion. At 20 hours in and New York, I struggle to enjoy this game. The story is good for the most part, and the combat is very good, but stealth and assassinations were the staple of previous titles. It feels like they focused on combat the most, while it is nice for the player who rushes in, leaves the player who wants to remain anonymous feeling limited. The notoriety system is somewhat interesting, but I feel as if it builds a little too fast (maybe that's just me). Finally, the the amount of content in the Frontier area is lacking, despite its vast size. Think AC Revelation's Constantinople but 70% of it is forest - That's the Frontier. 

I just think that the previous titles do Assassin's Creed a lot more justice. It feels half baked for an AC game. By all means, get it on sale, but even at $20 I think I should have let memories remain memories.",1665265282,1665265282,False,6,0,0.524361908435821533,0,True,False,False

There isn't much improvement other than the lighting engine, but I couldn't care less if it looks like gold considering this is the only version I can have. The biggest issue, and it's incredibly glaring, is the audio, the mixing is all wrong, things are significantly louder than others when they should be equal or quieter, and the dialogue audio sounds like it went through a compressor 10 times to sound worse than a PS1 game. Graphics are nice, but audio is just as important, when your first game has better audio quality than the remaster of your 5th entry, I think something's gone wrong. I've been playing through the games in order, and seeing the first hour of gameplay here, it's just sad, especially compared to the game just before it. I remember playing this when it came out on the PS3 and seeing it treated poorly like most ubisoft games now, it sucks. I wouldn't have bought this on its own, I got it in the big bundle of games when it was on sale, but with Ubisoft and where they're headed, none of the games are worth it.

TL;DR
If the game wasn't busted it'd be a 7/10, but with it in the state that it will die in, it's a 4/10.

A chance to dive into a fictional story set in a fixed history period. I loved every AC title.  Played the original ACIII on PC back in the day and really enjoyed the end of the trilogy, the Desmond story coming to an end, and the new gameplay features introduced were a blast. This review is based on a recent replay of the remastered version on PC (tried the remastered on Series X but is way too inferior to the PC remastered,  recon modern titles like AC Valhalla have great performance on consoles but these older AC entries really shine on PC)

The colonial American setting was brilliant. The game starts in 1754 during the French Indian War that led to the 7 years' war. But the majority of the game events take place during the revolutionary war, starting in 1775. You get to see the main character connor / Ratonnagethon take part and even influence the most historic events of that time, he gets blamed for the Boston Massacre in 1770 and takes place in the Tea Party 1773 when the king's tea gets tossed into the sea by angry citizens.  I really enjoyed comparing the game events and battles to the actual historical records and seeing how they implemented fiction upon a solid historic framework. After completing the game, I compared my notes taken during gameplay with events during the John Adams miniseries and the movies The crossing and The patriot, both released in the year 2000.

There is still a problem with some new gameplay mechanics, The headquarters/homestead evolution system is nice compared with previous entries but still feels incomplete. I can't tell how some of these mechanics were improved upon in the remastered. The convoy trading system is something I ignored completely in the original, and with the remastered, I wanted to give it a try, but it is just dumb and serves no purpose. The main problem is the progression, I guess. I had redeemed some weapons packs from Ubisoft club, but the game would not let me use them ""you need to complete sequence 6"" but after doing that you are almost in the final part of the game. Weapons are way too expensive you need to complete the game 1st and then do some forts and side activities to get the money to buy good swords, but then as the game is over there is not much to do with the items. The same with the naval missions. Tried to take them head-on at the start and quickly realized that I needed to upgrade the ship 1st to withstand those battles, but that requires a LOT of money. After I completed the game, took on some side activities to gather money and resources and finally upgraded the ship and then only then able to complete the SHIP missions, but they all take place during 1773 as they are prequels to the events of the main story... There is something wrong here. But I was happy that my expensive officer sword would at least be used in the DLC that I intended to engage in after completing all the main game activities, so I was equipped with good tools for the job.

The Washington Tyranny DLC was a blast, love the take on an alternate reality where Washington got corrupted by the apple. The new gameplay features were amazing, but here is the shock: you can't carry those special abilities back into the main game. And you can't carry progression from the main game into the DLC, I know there is an alternate universe and all. But still, there is a clear progression design that was not solved during the remastered process. So everything I did during the main game as far as progression, the fancy sword, the upgraded expensive ship... oh my :/

If you enjoyed ACIII, the remastered version is the best way to re-experience one of the best AC of all time. There are clear design flaws in the progression system, but it's only natural since these are the 1st entries of this franchise and many of these flaws were corrected and improved in new releases.",1663160149,1663160399,True,3,1,0.504470944404602051,0,True,False,False

I had weird off-putting feeling in every second I spent playing the game, and I don't really know where to put it. This remaster is my very experience for AC3 and I haven't played the original. A jump of graphics from AC Revelations and then back to AC4 Black Flag can be a bit off putting since this remaster features modern visual fidelity compare to other original installments. I'll get to the graphics later but this remaster whole existence is very much unneeded and felt cashgrab-ish. Since the Ezio trilogy has a remastered collection, why not just take AC4 and Rogue too for the remastered treatment? These three games are pretty much set in almost similar time periods with AC4 and Rogue taking place before AC3.

Let's start with the story. There's is alot of controversy with the ending of AC3, and I pretty much on the majority side of the group. I have no idea why the ending is the way it is. Isolating the ending, what about the overall story? Well, the story is okay, The bar to reach is very high with this game since the past 3 games are pretty much top-notch in storytelling. AC3 also has an interesting story that tackles in theme of morality and the grey areas of both Assassins' and Templars' philosophy. Also a tale of revenge by the new main character, Connor, which can be badass but sometimes boring. Him being stoic is not very entertaining for me. He needs a character to bounce off from to shine, atleast in my opinion. I cannot recall any other feats Connor has other than steadfast and serious. 

The gameplay is fun. The combat here is the most satisfying I've had in an Assassins' Creed game. I would not say the best, but incase I'm stuck with the franchise and have a choice to pick an installment where I can turn off my brain and go wacky, its this game. All hits feel satisfying and crunchy with sometimes accompinied by multikills which have unique animations depending on the weapon and number of enemies. The combat here is very amazing. 

On to the downsides, the graphics looks very weird although being a remaster that prides in high visual fidelity. I don't if its because of the lighting or texture or old artstyle not evolving with the new, it just looked very unsettling. I've mentioned the story abit but yes, taking place after the compelling Ezio Trilogy made AC3's story feel very mediocre. 

The soundtrack by Lorne Balfe is something I will cherish from this game. One of the best in the franchise with banger after banger.

Overall, a mixed bag.

I love how the small amount of ship/sailing-based missions are building toward what we now know is Black Flag, but there is some fun variety there.

I'm also very appreciative of this game's approach in getting rid of grinding -- mainly, the hundreds upon hundreds of chests scattered throughout the world. Now, the chests provide some money but tangible recipes/plans to be used in the (previously mentioned as awful) homestead building.

I'm not a fan of this game's approach to Brotherhood building. It seems like a step back from what we got in Revelations. I had trouble getting assassin's leveled up to the point where they could complete missions. Most of the time, I could only get to an 80% success rate -- regardless of how many I chose -- which is perplexing. I much prefer the previous build in how it worked.

There is a few issues with the lip sync and the voice in the game, but nothing terrible.
The mechanics are amazing and entertaining, especially for the combat and the free run is quite fluid which let's you work around the scenery much more.
When it comes to the story, I will go with a hot take here, but yes... is noticeable that Ratonhnhaké:ton/Connor suffers from a lack of dialogue and seems hellbent on his mission. But the game provides life through the NPC's, been quite lively and balancing the lack of dialogue from the main protagonist of the game, but thankfully so, sometimes even he has some moments that can be remembered. His father as a starting character during the first part of the game is quite the choice but makes everything fit all together for this tale.
And about the present day part... what an ending right there!

Anyway, anything I can say about this game has been already written, but this is still part of my first ever marathon of all the AC games because I've never played before and I'm doing this on the proper sequence. And now for the next one, which is almost everybody's favorite, AC4: Black Flag!

If you're reading this and you're on the fence about AC3, give it a chance, the game starts slows but picks up fast and you will enjoying a lot! And don't forget to take PLENTY of picture of the Davenport Homestead during the summertime while is the afternoon, absolutely gorgeous!

While Assassin's Creed III technically doesn't impress with its scale as much today as it did in 2012, it still offers a very entertaining portion of gameplay for players patient enough to sit through the lengthy intro.

However, I cannot recommend the remastered version with a clear conscience. Although this version offers significant improvements over the 2012 version and adds all the DLC and Assassin's Creed Liberation to the package, the game is riddled with technical issues, particularly lighting problems that completely undermine the original art direction of the game.

Given Ubisoft's silence, I don't expect the situation to improve in the future. If you get a chance, play the original 2012 version. This remaster is hardly up to the standards of modern games.",1659990054,1659990054,False,3,0,0.522323369979858398,0,True,False,False

Best historical setting (IMO) to come out of the franchise and riding the high of the Ezio trilogy surely meant this game was going to be good right? Absolutely f*cking wrong, this is, by far, the worst entry into the AC franchise to date (yes I'm aware that Odyssey exists). Some minor spoilers (duh) but this game is a decade old so f*ck off.

Let's start with the positives though.
Haytham is a very well  written character who's ideals and actions feel not just justified, but respectable and dare I say commendable. His plot twist at the end of Sequence 3 is one of the best in the franchise, and every moment he shows up on screen is pure gold.

The world building is also pretty well done, if telegraphed and a bit predictable. visually it's what you would hope for and expect for a game this old, and there is a lot to be said for running through the canopy of the frontier just to hang a freezing redcoat from a branch in the dead of winter is absolutely marvelous and visually stunning.

Unfortunately, that's all the positives I can think of without pandering to my favorite franchise of all time. So let's talk about the mediocrity. Things that were kinda cool/gimmicky or had a good foundation but just weren't built up as well as they could have been.

Homestead Missions - I actually really enjoyed these. Connor's interactions with the Davenport citizens was awesome. The idea of building up a settlement with unique characters that provide value both storywise and mechanically to the game was really good, but fell short in a few places. I think that upgrading citizens should have more impact than just unlocking more crafting options. There would have been a lot more added value through uncovering hidden treasures, more customization options, the tower defense mode from revelations, while it was kinda bad in AC:R, I think could have actually worked here if you could build your own defenses, visually showing upgrades/enhancements to the homestead rather than just adding a new building and dialog options for each citizen. Etc, Etc, Etc... Basically Ubi could have put forth a tiny bit more effort and this part of the game would have gone from mediocre to absolutely awesome.

Naval missions - there was actually some uniqueness here and being that this was the shell for the magnificent naval mechanics of AC4, I can't hate this too much. These missions and mechanics actually boded well for what was to come in AC4 and while the system here isn't great, that is mostly due to just being unpolished and underdeveloped, for what was ultimately side content in this game regardless. Definitely could have been better, but looking at all the sh*t later in this review, it could have been way worse.

Homestead leads to my next point of the Creed. Using Davenport as a mechanic to build up the Creed and using the citizens to supply/enhance/etc would have made a rather dull mechanic much better. The assassin recruits are ultimately just busy work, they aren't necessary, you can go the entire game never interacting with the other 5 and Stephane is only there due to being part of a main story mission. It was a nice thing to add in, but could have been way more rewarding and way more than a copy paste from AC:Brotherhood/Revelations.

Wow this review is long, and the negatives are the longest too -.- I'll try to speed run the negatives like playing Russian Roulette with Connor's one shot flintlock.

Let's start with Connor - what an absolute sh*t show of a bland, entirely forgettable character. No character growth, no emotional growth, and honestly after playing this game to 100% completion twice now, I don't think there has ever been a character who needlessly whines about things that don't feel important whatsoever. Maybe Joffrey from Game of Thrones, but if we are comparing Connor to a 10 year old boy who is the product of incest than we have a lot of other problems. Connor doesn't speak much, and I don't think he ever says anything impactful. BuT EnGlISh Is HiS sEcOnD lAnGuAgE. F*ck right off, Ubi didn't do that intentionally, this is poor writing and character development at it's worse. It's evident through Connor not being the only poorly scripted character, just about every character in the game is dreadfully boring (Haytham excluded, see above). It's such a systemic issue in this game even groups of people are just dull. Templars, assassins, sons of liberty, The Masons, everyone is just uninspired.

Combat - it was nice that Ubi streamlined the combat system, but it was at the expense of feeling like you could actually become skilled at it. The prior games had a bunch of key/control combos that did different things that were really interesting, whereas as this just felt like a press ""B"" sim. Combined with the fact that enemy actions were so telegraphed that the whole experience just sucked.

(The speedrun isn't going well, must be stuck in reload animation)

Traversal - never has running across rooftops been so frustrating and legitimately pointless. Snipers target you as soon as you start to climb, there's just enough gaps between buildings where you can't seamlessly sprint from one side of a city to the other, plus Connor likes to take the least desirable traversal option every chance he gets. Literally just running on the ground is better. There is also the fast travel system. I understand that sync points aren't used for fast travel since they introduced the underground, but WHY don't sync points reveal more of the map then??? I want fast travel to save time, not to spend 2 hours wandering in pitch black tunnels to complete sh*tty puzzles. Is this a little nitpicky on my end? Yes. Do I care? F*ck off with your bullsh*t Ubi. Not to mention that there is effectively no useful fast travel locations in the frontier. Oh, and moving around during winter is awful, despite how pretty it can be in game. Realistic? Sure. Infuriating? Mind-numbingly so.

Side quests - for something that is meant to be a time sink, these really were a sink. Collection quests that get botched by the shoddy crafting and hunting QTE systems, Go somewhere and do something that you'll never do in the normal course of the game activities, etc. Side content is supposed to add value in some sort of way. There's a lot of ways to add value. This content didn't. Did you know that Sasquatch and the Headless Horseman are in the game? I say ""in like they spend more than 1.7 seconds on screen. Sasquatch is just a tall loner dude and the Horseman *Exists*. Absolutely just wasteful with their ideas.

Stealth - For a franchise that's built on stealth, running across rooftops and silently reducing the population of evildoers one assassination at a time, there is no stealth mechanic here. Enemies will detect you basically anywhere if you arent hiding, especially in the frontier where for whatever reason you always have notoriety? Like why. Not just that, but the dumbed down combat dissuades you from even trying stealth. Why would I spend 15 minutes pulling 3 guys into a stack of hay just to be detected by some guard on the other side of the map for the 3/10's of a second that I'm technically visible for when I could run in and just start committing homicide by mashing the B button and be done with it in 30 seconds?

TL;DR - 2/10, There are a few redeeming qualities about this game, none of which are worth spending money on, there are a bunch of points I didn't touch on because they've been talked to death (Desmond/modern setting scenes, bugs, plot holes, etc). I tried to compare this game only to previous games as each game should be better than it's predecessors and this is just nowhere near that. The only reason I would recommend this game is there is some slight lore set up for future games (Black Flag, Rogue, and Syndicate) but not anything necessary to enjoy those experiences.",1659532020,1659532020,False,15,2,0.501087844371795654,0,True,False,False

Even though it has a somewhat interesting story, it continues the Juno cycle, it has an interesting plot twist, I still find this game a huge hot pile of mess.
Throughout the entire game I felt more like I'm just clicking my way through than playing the game, combat is very dull, not smooth at all, and it requires almost no skill, just click-click-click in the direction of enemy.
The game also had a lot of stuff to do with no particular reason. As a completionist for the first time probably I gave up on doing each and every quest in the game, I was bored. The game's economy seems useless as I never found some purpose for money, I finished the game without purchasing anything save for few arrows and some bullets. Homestead missions and the entire mechanics of producing stuff in your village and selling it is ridiculous.

One way or the other, I rushed through the game to see the story. The ending was particularly rushed in my opinion and instead of having an interesting mission and possibly a fight, it was just a silly chase and then a very long cutscene. Oh yeah, I felt this game has too many cutscenes as well, I felt like I spent more time watching them than playing the actual game.

I've been working on completing every main AC game since I bought AC4 back in 2016. Before this entry, I've played most of the titles minus Valhalla and Syndicate. I'll have a Tl;dr at the end. By the way, my hours are bugged. I have around 15 hours instead of the 6 that is listed.

Going off what I've been told and the first hour of gameplay, my first impressions of the game were positive. The story seemed to start off well, and I really enjoyed how much care they put into the native American side of Connor's life. I really enjoyed Haytham and his way of operating in the tutorial sequence.

But as I progressed in the game, some glaring issues popped up. First of all, the climbing is atrocious. Maybe it's because I just finished Unity, but I honestly was having such a horrible time with the climbing. It took me forever to figure out how to climb a tree, along with the infamous running up a wall issue that I heard so much about. I failed the final chase mission with Charles Lee at least 10 times because of the absolutely horrible climbing mechanics. Connor and Desmond were always doing the exact opposite of what I wanted all the time. It honestly felt like a downgrade compared to Revelations. Along with this, I found the movement to be bugged in general. Connor glitching through rocks and ledges, bodies being flung 40 feet in the air for no reason, etc. The one thing that pissed me off the most was the horse. It gets stuck on anything and everything. It won't jump over the smallest things, its pretty slow, and it controls like garbage. When you get shot, the horse gets hit instantly regardless of if the shot hit or not which I found more annoying than anything. Probably the worst movement / climbing since AC1.

Next, was the story itself. Although I loved the setting, the story really fell apart later in the game. At the beginning I really liked where the story was going until I was introduced to Connor. I found him very aloof, and like an angsty teenager. He was kind of an asshole to everyone except his own people, and he really wasn't too warm to them either. He was constantly saving the founding father's asses the whole game. Seemingly out of the FF's incompetence. They were indifferent to his annoying behavior and he was well liked in the end regardless. Washington's portrayal also didn't sit right with me either. I found most of the supporting characters minus Achilles to be pretty annoying overall. The only good part was the modern storyline, which has its own issues but ended Desmond’s story pretty well.

There were multiple chances to completely take out the Templars that Connor was hunting yet Connor opted for some bullshit plan when the answer was right in front of him multiple times. For example, one of the last missions was where Connor had to approach Charles Lee while he was giving a speech. Instead of shooting him, rushing in there and stabbing him, or stealthily climbing buildings for an assassination, he instead opted to walk right up to him and get caught. This is after years of assassin experience. Just one example.

Graphics for 2012 were decent, but the remastered version did nothing to improve on this. I heard they reworked the weapon menus, so I guess that's a plus. Speaking of weapons, I found myself not caring about the weapon variety. I went through the whole game with the stock weapons, didn't touch anything other than the bow, hidden blades, pistol, and axe. It just shows you how pointless it all is. I never used any consumables either, or hunted for that matter. There were a lot of things that were useless to me unless I was trying to 100% the game.

The ship mechanic was kinda cool, but not even close to AC4 in that front. I found it boring and the controls to be worse than AC4. Also is useless unless you're trying to 100% the game. I didn't like how you had to hold shift to charge a shot and fire, selecting different shot types was annoying, pressing spacebar and E to raise or lower sail was also a dumb choice. Swivel guns were mostly useless even against the smaller ships unless it was on a weak point that only appeared on the bigger ships. Ship combat frankly didn't flow like it does in AC4, good news is that there were only 2-3 missions that used the thing.

AI across the board is pretty bad, either they are super dumb on 0-1 notoriety level, or omnipotent gods on level 2+. I hate the notoriety system in general. Too hard to lose notoriety, and the game becomes unplayable at anything above level 1. Another thing AC4 does a lot better. In AC3, I can sometimes bait enemies to jump off docks and drown while sitting there, other times they would know exactly where I was after weaving through buildings for a while and broke line of sight 2 minutes prior. Its inconsistent as hell.

People claim the combat was gutted in the new gen AC games, yet the combat here felt like: Press R to shoot some people till you run out of ammo, spam left MB, spam E when an enemy attacks you, or press spacebar when you can’t counter an attack. Another thing I noticed was that if you’re in the middle of a chain attack on an enemy and don’t complete it for the kill, it seems that their health just completely goes back to full. I had an enemy survive 6 cancelled chain attacks once because I was hit out of each one before it finished. None of the flair from the Ezio trilogy is present here. A pretty boring experience tbh, AC4 does a little better on this side of things (Along with just about everything else).

I’ve touched on the bugs a little bit, but I found this to be the buggiest AC game I’ve played thus far. I didn’t play Unity on release but I’m sure AC3 on release could rival it. And they clearly didn’t fix much in the remastered version.

Meh to decent story, half-baked / useless mechanics, bugs out the ass, pointless items and collectibles, inconsistent AI, no notable improvements over the OG version, and a subpar experience.

Ubisoft also thinks it is clever to put the game on promotion for new suckers just before REMOVING the game.  Ie AC Liberation HD was on promotion price last week during the Steam summer sale, this week the store page says the game will no longer playable in 6 weeks time.  

The Steam store pages (links below) for AC Liberation HD, and Silent Hunter 5, both have notices saying ""Please note this title will not be ACCESSIBLE following September 1st, 2022"".  Even though you BOUGHT these single player games, you will not be able to access them.

65/100 ACIII Remastered is the very definition of inconsistent.  Only play this if you are an AC completionist, and expect lots of frustration.  I'd recommend playing any of the ACII trilogy, AC IV, Origins, or Odyssey instead.  

The world is beautiful, the historical time period is interesting, the naval missions are fun.  The biggest issue is one minute you're enjoying the game, the next minute the game takes away player agency and frustrates the heck out of you with instafail or restricted sections.  You can spend 40 hours crafting, getting weapons and extras like smoke bombs, increasing the pouch sizes etc, but then the game will decide to take away your ability to use most of these tools, and force you to play sections in a particular way without access to these.  

The story is even more jarring than usual, you are not just flipping back and forth between in the animus and outside the animus: partway through you simply change to playing a different ancestor, and suddenly you are playing this sappy child, and you are trying to kill the old player character, who was cool.  And no, that doesn't spoil the story, the story is already spoiled by being just weirdly told and disjointed.

The Remaster is half-baked, there is no PDF manual, there is an in-game manual but it does not include basic things like controls for the naval battles, playing the mini-games etc.  Customise controls does not allow you to see/change all the keys, nor does what they are named in customise controls match what you see on the screen for ingame prompts.  The controls have been radically revised between ACIII (2012) and ACIII Remastered (2019), with practically every key changing.  Ubisoft has not bothered to update the naming for onscreen control key prompts for things like run, nor does customise controls tell you what key to use for run.  Ubisoft support sent me a 2 page PDF of controls, but it is for ACIII (2012) not ACIII Remastered (2019) and the keys are very different.  Run is actually called high profile in customise controls now, ie the name of the action in customise controls (high profile) does not match the onscreen prompts (run), and don't even bother trying to find the naval battle key for take cover (left mouse) in customise controls, it's not there, nor is it in the in-game manual, nor is there a manual on the Ubisoft website, and Ubisoft will tell you the wrong control keys/the control keys for a different game.  

Overall definitely the weakest of all the AC games I've played so far.

UPDATE after completing The Tyranny of Washington DLC: just like the base game, this included DLC is inconsistent, 65/100, and not recommended.  The DLC is completely linear, there are no sync points, only one active mission, no side quests.  There are chests containing consumables, but there is no money, and your inventory regularly disappears between play sessions, so going after the chests is pointless.  The missions are frustrating, especially in the first two episodes of the DLC.  The first animal power mission tells you to follow the heartbeat of the elk, I have 7.2 sound in my home theatre which is directional in other games, but the sound is not directional in this mission.  The only saving grace is that Episode 3 is enjoyable for the most part once you have all 3 of your animal powers.  But again, the game has a habit of making you work to earn rewards, then taking away player agency.  Eg when exploring the zoo, you can't simply use your eagle flight to move around everywhere, you are forced to platform some sections even though you now have your eagle powers.

UPDATE#2 after completing Assassin's Creed III: Liberation Remastered.  I really enjoyed Liberation, and give it 85/100.  It is about 12 hours long, mostly a lot easier than other AC games, and I would say one of my favourites (along with Odyssey, Origins and Black Flag).  I really liked Aveline (she just reinforces what a sap Connor is).

I thought the idea and execution of the 3 personas was really well done and made the game more interesting.  I would suggest Liberation is a good place to start if you've never played any AC games, as it's shorter and easier (although as a newcomer, you would find a lot of things not well explained by the tutorials, eg leaping through trees, leaping backward, leaps of faith, etc).  

It still has a lot of the usual Ubisoft rubbish, like ""you dropped connection to the Ubisoft server"" immediately upon starting every time, the game started crashing every time you quit, from about halfway through, and it seemed there was a lack of QA and testing on some of the missions, getting stuck underwater inside rocks etc.

Anyway it's kind of bizarre that this is just chucked in with AC3 Remastered, in my opinion it is far superior to the main act (albeit a lot shorter), but it was nice to finish this package on a high.",1647808285,1657531940,False,3,2,0.501742184162139893,0,True,False,False

倒数第二关就是对打用防反，和一个支线任务打擂鬼一个操作。 倒数第一关又是追上去抓住James就行了。这是刺客任务还是跑步任务？一点没有刺客任务该有的潜入暗杀。

这破游戏还有好几关这种追上去的任务， 那匹破马也是所有AC中最慢的，体力只能加速不超过10秒然后就停了？能理解游戏想做得真实马不可能一直跑，但停了是几个意思。

I played the original release many years ago and definitely do not remember it being this miserable of an experience. At the time, it was my favorite AC game. I am genuinely shocked at how buggy and poorly designed this game is. 

There's two major things this game claims to have improved upon which I wholeheartedly disagree with. I just finished playing through the Ezio games, and I can say with certainty that the movement and combat systems in those older games was much better than this one. Movement in this game feels unpredictable and unwieldy. 

There's no hard locking in combat now, and the camera is poorly designed which will leave you disoriented during combat as it swings around and puts enemies out of line-of-sight. This is made worse by the fact that heavy enemies and officers are absolutely everywhere and make combat boring and slow. 

The AI awareness is OFF THE CHARTS. You could assassinate someone from a bush 1000 meters from a soldier facing away from you, and they will immediately notice you and alert the entire fort. Enemies seem to have 360 degree vision. The notoriety system means burping in public will alert every enemy to your presence and merely walking down the street will start to build awareness. 

Every system in this game feels like it's just there to slow progress and frustrate the player.  

The bugs. My god. The bugs. I cannot play a single mission without same BS game-breaking bug. I hopped off my horse and fell through the map. I stopped an enemy caravan and one of the horses merged with the cart, trapping me inside so I had to fast travel to get away from it (thus losing the loot which I should have gained). I mean, it's real bad. 

I am going to finish this game because I'm trying to play through all the AC games in release-order to follow the story. That said, every moment feels like a punishment. I've stopped doing side missions and am focusing on story only so I can get through this nightmare as quickly as possible.",1657495201,1657495201,False,13,0,0.528975129127502441,0,True,False,False

However, it has to be said that most of the changes aren’t deal-makers that would change peoples’; minds if they didn’t like the original.

Certain small improvements like controls more in-line with modern Assassin’s Creed games, more detailed map outlines, new outfits, being able to whistle in bushes, and ability to craft multiple items at once are all fine and good. All the DLC from the original is automatically included in the game as well.

Sadly, there are a few “improvements” that don’t really improve the game that much or even seem worse than the original. The character models look less detailed despite the environment looking better, and it’s now required to have a recipe to craft items. Finally, as multiplayer was completely removed, thought how much of a loss that is depends on the person.

In addition to changes in Assassin’s Creed III, Remastered also includes the remastered version of Assassin’s Creed Liberation, though aside from the DLC and Ubisoft Connect items being included and actually working in this version, there really isn’t much to talk about. It’s still a subpar Assassin’s Creed spin-off that may as well be seen as a novelty or bonus to the main content.

These remastered versions are overall a net positive compared to the originals, but not by much. Problems like the slow start, mapping system, and bugs from the original are all not fixed that much in Remastered, so anyone that didn’t enjoy the original won’t be swayed. That said, with both the original ACIII and Liberation delisted and having their DLC and other bonuses already or soon be defunct, this will be the version to buy (or pirate, since you just know online services for this version will also be taken down in a few years).",1655665815,1657439251,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

When launching AC3 Remaster, Ubisoft Connect asks for you to enter a CD key. This was par for the course with previous titles. However, Steam does not provide CD keys for AC3R. In order to activate, you must download and link Odyssey to your Ubisoft account, which will allow you to link AC3R next time you launch it. This is not stated anywhere to inform new customers.

The game is capped at 62 FPS, but consistently drops to 40-50. The option for 144Hz is there, but selecting it does not do anything. Some people have claimed that the original game could break above 60FPS, but I have not experienced that. If that is the case, I would rather take some bugs at 90+ FPS over this version, which is capped at 60 and can barely even maintain that.

I eventually got annoyed enough to reinstall the non-remastered version, which ended up looking better in my opinion anyway. The remastered version looks great for screenshots, but cutscenes look pretty poor. Lighting causes face models to be so bright they appear plastic. The lighting also makes shadows extremely dark. I had trouble finding a haystack to jump into under half the viewpoints in Boston because when you're high up, the streets appear so dark you can hardly make anything out.

Light sources are, again, screenshot pretty. They are so blown out in gameplay. In cutscenes, I would find that light sources behind the camera would give the entire screen a massive bloom effect that took me out of the immersion more often than not. It ended up being more distracting than anything.

The controls are also a bit off in this version. Using a Series X controller, the X axis aiming is way off. If I point straight while freerunning, I'd often end up jumping to the side off of building because the analog controls are not very precise. There is a massive deadzone, and when you eventually move the analog stick far enough, the aiming response is very strong, even when I lowered the sensitivity to 2. I don't find this problem in the original version. This might be fixable with third party controller software, but that's more trouble than its worth in my opinion,

I remember playing this game on the XBox 360 back in the day, it was by far a favourite of mine and I had always wanted to buy the PC version. 
The remastered version of this game when not on sale is highly unreasonable for the changes they have made, i recommend you buy this on sales for this very reason.
Although unimpressed with what they have actually remastered I can 100% recommend the game to anyone wanting to re-play or even play for the first time, you explore different characters and for those who played on the old consoles it will bring a sense of nostalgia.

I got the Remastered version with the Odyssey season pass, and played it to check out the DLC, which I haven’t played back then (it was great!). The remastered version adds new visuals, which look better for the most part, although the lighting and faces look weird in some scenes. There are some minor gameplay improvements too, but for the most part it’s the same, with all the bugs and jank that was in the original.

Originally, I was curious about Assassin's Creed 3 mostly because the main character is a native. It is something that sounded interesting to me as Native American cultures are massively underrepresented in gaming.

As I thought, Connor being a native wasn't the focus of the story, but it was still a nice inclusion. I learned some things about them, and I liked that they spoke their native language. As for the story itself, I think it was great idea to start with Haytham and basically show the world from the antagonists' perspective (even though I knew he wasn’t the main character, the twist actually managed to surprise me). I think the characters were reasonably well written, and the conflict was pleasantly shades of gray. I also liked Connor, I just found him quite relatable. It is a bit comical sometimes how he ends up involved in every main event of the revolution, but this is not really a problem, just funny. Even with that, I think the story was good, and I think it’s the game’s main strength.

The locations, colonial Boston and the frontier, first seemed boring, but they slowly grew on me, and I ended up liking them. The Frontier was particularly atmospheric. I really enjoyed just exploring it, and hunting there, especially in the winter. Speaking of hunting, there are a bunch of side activities that I enjoyed: the Peg Leg missions, which were short linear, but well designed, fun quests, the Boston Brawlers, bare handed combat challenges, and the Homestead Missions, story heavy quests about people living near the Assassin HQ, chronicling them becoming a real community over time. Many of these quests involve combat, which I found to be really well done. It is based around counters, but has enough variety to make it interesting, and the character animations are top notch. I can't stress this enough, the movements are just spectacular, and every weapon type has its own moveset.

Gameplay was a mixed bag though. Having separate slow walk and fast walk was really nice, but the newer games have normal sprint and parkour sprint, which would've been really needed here. Many times I just wanted to sprint at street level without Connor trying to climb every random nearby object, but it is not an option. This made chasing or being chased very annoying. It also has that thing common in the old games where you press a direction and jump, but the character jumps in another direction. The controls in general were simply not reliable enough, although I did like the tree parkour. Jumping from branch to branch was fun.

Stealth did have its problems as well. For example, a basic method of hiding is crouching into bushes. The problem is that there is no crouch button, Connor does this automatically, except when he doesn't feel like it, and you just get detected without doing anything wrong as a player. I also encountered multiple situations where I got detected when I shouldn't have been, or when I got attacked out of nowhere, even in incognito. It was cool when I could pull off a stealthy segment, but this game is just not a very good stealth game.

I have to say, there was one mechanic that was really well done, and it's the assassin recruits. Unlike in Brotherhood, every recruit is a named character with their own story, but more importantly, they all add a unique assassin ability when recruited. For example, apart from the default assassination, you can order a sniper shot on an enemy, or call a friendly assassin to lure away guards, or the best one, Covert Escort: two of your buddies dress up as enemies, while you pretend to be a prisoner. You can walk into enemy strongholds like this without arousing suspicion, and cause mayhem at the desired moment. This is legit one of the coolest things in the franchise.

So, as much as I ended up liking the world and the story, the unreliable controls, stealth, and mechanics in general were a big annoyance, but despite these pissing me off many times, I still enjoyed the game. I guess the magic of historical adventure sucked me in, like it did with the other AC titles. It wasn't bad for ""edutainment"" either, as I pretty much got a crash course on the events of the American revolution while playing.

1. The graphics are better than the previous entries

Cons
1. Final act of the game sucks in all regards

3. Lack of tutorials and guidelines at some points that make the experience frustrating
4. The map is not so good

Summary
This game had bad reviews but I was willing to give it a chance. People said they hated the prologue and the protagonist. Up until the 8th sequence of the game I considered this game to be better than any previous entry. The prologue was a big pro for me and the protagonist was on par with Ezio in terms of how intriguing he was, even though he is different - the better protagonist is a subjective matter. Better gameplay, better graphics and even if many aspects of the game are not polished, it's logical since the game was a step up in terms of how big and complex it was. Everything was fun until the end of the 8th sequence.
And then everything went sideways for me. The story became like your typical Steven Seagal b-movie. Inconsistent behavior from the characters, plot holes, the story stopped making sense and it was so hasty as if D. Weiss and D. Benioff wrote the final act along with the final seasons of game of thrones.  And when the story and characters gets so messed up, all the cons of the game, the small glitches, the lack of guidelines in certain parts, the lack of tutorials BEFORE you enter a mission, the unpolished aspects of the gameplay, the repetition of certain side missions, all seem way more frustrating than before. I started the game and wanted to complete every part of it for the first time in an Assassin's Creed game, but at the end of the 8th sequence everything broke up for me and I just run through the main story up to sequence 11 and then I just couldn't have any more of this. I will watch the ending on youtube just to see how the Desmond story ends. I do not recommend this game. Read the story and just go to the next one.

PROS:
1. In terms of texturing and lighting it is not as bad as most people take it to be. In my opinion, developers have done a good job in field lights and shades in the game, and skin textures are also nicely done as compared to the original one.
2. Volumetric fogs: I saw some complsining about it too, but, according to me, volumetric fog fills some sort of realism in the overall environment of the game.

CONS:
1. Glitches: I had to deal with glitches and bugs before, in the original game, while playing it in PS3. Seems like developers have little effort to draw attention to this, as this game also jas a same problem.
2. Although, I can somewhat appreciate colour brightness in this game, but in most cases, you will find that it is being overused. Like, the nighttime looks more like morning time in it due to heavy increase of colour brightness.",1654710462,1654710462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]graphics[/h1]
not the top-tier, but definitely meet modern 3A standards. Environments are spectacular. This world expertly captures the lost grandeur of north American landscape. Every single scenic shot is gorgeous. From colonial brick buildings and waving grasses to thin lips and plastic faces of characters, performance is more or less better than original one.


[h1]EXCELLENT soundtrack[/h1]
My second favourite soundtrack behind Black Flag. Main theme sounds so heroic and epic, and fits the story of American Revolution well. It always conjures up images of Connor (or Ratonhnaké:ton) racing through forests, leaping from one tree to another, or killing an entire redcoats in snowy valleys. 

Here are some I highly recommend: 
1. Main Theme
2. Trouble in Town 
3. Connor's Life


[h1]gameplay[/h1]
There're still some BUGs, remastered only means better graphics, instead of remake. Stalwart AC activities like climbing a peak for synchronization, gain information, eavesdropping, shadowing, taking over Templar areas or ripping posters off wall to preserve your anonymity. Compared with old ACs, you can ran across trees in parkour now and there's a much better combat system. Most important component is the exemplary naval combat. It's like a sailing simulation and allows you to accomplish different mission with Connor, obviously he inherits something from Edward Kenway.

 By the way, though Connor is a deadliest badass who can kill the whole district, but it's hard to get all his 100% story sync, strict optional objectives are designed for assassin more than warrior.


[h1]story[/h1]
I like this story, but weirdly for some uncertain reason, devs delete some plots like Connor's speech, and they put important scences in homestead mission, which means you will miss them if just uninstall game after story over. e.g. Connor is named after Achilles's dead son.

'Life is not a fairy tale and there are no happy endings'. [spoiler]Connor as a native american, he wants safety and security for his people, fights against Templars who try to control the whole colony, but he almost loses everything in end. His tribes, allies, people and land, all gone, except his strong belief in freedom. He helps the american revolution, but the man he aids not only burns the village, but ultimately forces his people out of their territories for expansion of settlements. He seeks for unification with templars but ends in tragedy.

The reason Connor being one of my favourite protagonists is he is real. Irrational, naive, no matter the cost, and finally become a strong, stoic, wise man who fights for his belief as always. Remember he shouts out, 'because no one else will'. He is such a relatable role. Feel the same thing replaying the Desmond trilogy. I also like in homestead, how he tries to help friends and shows his kindness, everyone likes him, where he expresses more emotion than in main story. [/spoiler]

What makes AC3 so potent to me is the fact that it has an overarching climatic feel, and the timeline was more or less had a greater impact to the leading events that would shape our modern history.


At the end of this review, I love AC3, it's fun to sink hours into Ubisoft's version of colonial America, fight against redcoats or just ride across Frontier and enjoy beauty of nature. It may not displace Brotherhood as the high watermark of the series, but it revitalizes what is in danger of becoming another tired franchise, and sets it back on track.",1654013700,1654013917,True,13,0,0.63000786304473877,0,True,False,False

I think the story is great, because it has a good setup, because you get to play as the bad guy, which is a long-needed addition to the series. It gives you more perspective on the side of the Templars. I also think that Haytham is a stellar character. He's my second favourite character in the whole series and they should've made another game about him in my opinion.

Next to that, I think Connor is a pretty good character, he's not really a fun character, but he's determined and he's just a more introverted character than the fan favourite, Ezio. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that, not every character has to have the charisma of Ezio to qualify as a good character. 

The father-son dynamic is really interesting, because they're also on the opposite sides of their beliefs. They often argue about what's right. These conversations are very interesting, because Haytham often wins the debate, which makes me doubt whether the Assassin's are really the good guys and the Templars are really bad. 

Another thing I love about this game are all the historical characters this game includes, like Washington and Benjamin Franklin which are one of my favourite historical figures. I'm really glad they made a dlc where Washington was seduced by the apple of Eden, which was an interesting concept, which they've executed very well. I actually think that this was the best DLC in the AC games that I've played. 

Aside from the story, the combat system is really neat as well and it really feels like Connor is such a beast, which makes the combat more fun. 

I also think that the modern story line is improved on a lot, because things titened up and they brought a satisfying conclusion to the Desmond story line.

I will admit, that the city's aren't too great. They don't look that pretty, because they're all made of wood and their isn't much variety, then again the creators of this game wanted to respect the architectural design of these cities. So it might not have been the right choice to make these cities prettier, because the credibility of the series might get compromised. I think a lot of the things in the open world are actually quit fun and I liked all of the side content in this game. 

All in all, I think this is a really solid game and I definitely think people should cut this game some slack. After Origins this is my favourite Assassin's Creed Game and I give this game an 8,5/10.",1653847388,1653859173,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Somehow it also manages to be the buggiest in the series, in my experience. Nothing game-breaking, just little things. As a remaster, it looks a lot better than the original when it comes to environments which now use PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) textures and materials, which means everything looks and interacts with lighting much more realistically. I love it. Turn off the HUD during gameplay, and this is a seriously stunning, immersive experience. It's easy to get lost in the beauty and busyness of 18th Century Boston, New York and the Frontier. The character face models look a little off during cutscenes, probably because they worked better with the older-gen lighting system. It supports 4K HDR, but it's still locked at 60FPS, like the original. This is probably because of the physics engine being tied to 60FPS. All in all, I love it, but it's far from perfect.

This was the game that began a new era for Assassin's Creed. Everything changed, for the better in my opinion. The movement, animation, parkour, combat, etc.. looks very weighty, realistic and has a cinematic flow to it. It is also the first game to introduce tree parkour and ship sailing along with sea combat, good horse riding mechanics, and generally, it's massive in scope compared to previous titles. Very ambitious. There's new tools such as rope darts, flintlock pistols, muskets, bow and arrows, and the biggest selection of weapons including some new unique types, each with their own animation, combos and finishing moves. You truly feel like a killing machine... that Assassin Tomahawk... Oof! ;)

There is also wildlife hunting such as rabbits, deer, wolves, bears, and many more! It's a way of making money by selling / trading pelts or using them as crafting materials.

Oh, and the Homestead Missions are amazing!

""Used to be when people talked about the end of the world, we locked them up or laughed them off. Sometimes both. But we never took them seriously. Maybe we should have. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Better to start at the beginning - with the abduction of Desmond Miles. My son. This boy... had no ambition. No direction. No plans for the future. What he DID have was a heritage. One he chose to deny. It nearly cost him his life. He was captured and imprisoned. Those who took him believed he could help them find something. The Apple. One of several artefacts we call Pieces of Eden. Bits of ancient technology scattered across the globe. Some hidden. Some found. All of them dangerous. Most are held by a single group - the same group that now had Desmond. You know them as Abstergo Industries. We know them as the Templars - as the enemy. We've been fighting them for thousands of years. Even longer if you believe the stories of their origins. I do, after all, I've seen the truth. That's the beauty - and the horror - of the Animus. A device that allows us to enter and experience the lives of our ancestors. It holds the power to change everything. To show us history the way it really happened. Up until its creation - to the victor went the spoils - went the truth. We're trying to fix that. To free minds and bodies both. But there's only so much we can do. And the Templars have the upper hand these days. But something larger than the Assassins and Templars is approaching. Bigger than all of us. And if we can't find a way to stop it - these next few weeks will probably be our last. EVERYONE'S last. In the end, it all comes down to him. To Desmond. Through the Animus, he discovered his heritage. Explored the lives of his ancestors and uncovered their secrets. When that was done, he trained. He used another ancestor to provide decades of experience in the span of a few days. It worked. We think. We hope. Soon, though - soon, we'll know. That ominous date fast approaches. December 21st, 2012. None of us knows what it'll bring - only that this is where they want us to be when it does. They've been guiding us, in their own fractured, frustrating way. These voices from the First Civilisation, The Ones Who Came Before. A Precursor race of immense power and uncertain motives. They're the ones who made the Pieces of Eden. This is where they've led him, and through him, us. He stands at the entrance to this long-lost place, armed with the knowledge of Altaïr and the abilities of Ezio, he holds in his hands the Apple of Eden. And we stand at this side, ready to support him, however we can. His name is Desmond Miles and he has brought us to the end."" - William Miles, Mentor of 21st Century Assassin Brotherhood.

There is so, so much I want to say about this game. But it would turn into an essay. From the modern day missions with Desmond climbing corporate buildings, doing leaps-of-faith off skyscrapers, to infiltrating a Brazil stadium using social stealth and crowd blending, to muscling his way through Abstergo HQ like a boss, to the tragic story of Native American ancestor Ratonhnhaké:ton, or Connor Kenway, as we know him better, how he grows up into an absolute tank of a warrior, on the path of revenge, similar to young Ezio, witnessing the destruction of his village and death of his mother when Templars burned everything to the ground after the Mohawk people of Kanien'kehá:ka refused to let them take over their home land. He grows up to be Master Assassin of the Colonial Brotherhood, rebuilding what was lost and training under the watchful eye of previous Mentor Achilles Davenport, the Old Man On The Hill. 

Connor is the ""Batman"" of the series. Serious. Mature. A man on a mission. A beast in combat, he'll charge across a battlefield at an entire army firing musket shots and come out without a scratch. Nothing stands in his way. The Templars in this game are some of the best, and their motives, this time, due to excellent writing, make you question the Assassin's goals for once. 

That's not to say the Templars aren't bad. But it's the first time in the franchise that we begin to see the moral grey areas of both sides, both ideologies. The fact that the Grandmaster of the Templars is also Connor's father (Haytham Kenway) makes the journey even more interesting and, of course, emotional. Father and son - sworn enemies. Damn, I love Connor's story and character arc. 

And the soundtrack by Lorne Balfe! 
An adrenaline pumping, emotional and cinematic listening experience like no other in the franchise so far, in my opinion. Everything is just worthy of a blockbuster movie...

The story ends with Desmond seeing where Connor had hidden the ""key"" taken off the Templars, a special key needed to open the gates to the Grand Temple, where he saves the world - at a great price. The First Civilisation helped us, but they didn't tell us everything...

Assassin's Creed 3 is also the game that massively expands upon the First Civilisation, or as we know them these days due to recent games' lore, The Isu. Their Six (or Seven, actually) ""Methods of Salvation"" , etc... This is lore that recent games such as AC: Valhalla, digs deeper into. It's crazy how expansive and connected the entire franchise is, for references to make their way into new titles a decade later!

Pure badass, exciting nostalgia trip worthy of discussions, speculation and debates. YouTube channels like ""Access the Animus"" are great at decryption and researching the lore and events that happened in this game and how they link into later titles. I do recommend this game. It would be perfect if it wasn't for the occasional bugs that never got patched, even in the remaster. I have 100% completed it, including all optional sync objectives, many times since 2012... that's right. The game released in 2012, when the present day story in AC3 also takes place ;)",1652832671,1653331154,True,1,0,0.507692337036132813,3,True,False,False

The strongest point of Assassin's Creed III is its story.
it is the first Assassin's Creed game to add hunting mechanics and it was very limited as it always is with Ubisoft when it comes to videogames mechanics or anything really.

Now, i won't be talking about the game itself anymore, it has already been released before, this is a ""remaster"" and that's what i'm reviewing.
I'll keep it simple and short.

It's trash and Ubisoft should truly be ashamed of themselves but i guess they never will be considering all the trash they've been making, they're used to being like this at this point.

It should have been free for those who already owns Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed Liberation.
Even if it would have been a legit remastered, it should be free, now we're not even talking about a remastered, we're talking about a heck of a mess. 
Has more bugs, has ugly textures, has lot of problems that it did not have before.
Almost nothing has changed and they dare sell this trash for 50$?

Navy: Now I don't expect the boat to have the maneuverability of a jet ski but this was not fun at all.  The boat had the turning radius of a beached school bus and the acceleration of a tortoise.  Then there are the cannons.  For the bow and firearms you hold the right mouse button and then click the left mouse button.  When you do that with the swivel cannons it cancels the shot and puts you in cover.  Why couldn't they keep the controls consistent.  The cover is horrible because you have to wait way too long to get out of cover.  The enemy has enough time to reload and fire a second shot by the time you get out of cover.  The aiming of the swivel cannons are horrible.  They are constantly aiming at the ocean floor or dolphins or something.  I kept wanting them to aim up but they would go left and right just to shoot into the water under the boats.  The main cannons were horrible as well.  There is a delay from you want to fire until they actually fire.  By the time they fire the other ship has docked and hit the pub already.  I tried the chain mail and that was terrible.  It has the flight speed of a seagull and the range of a junior high baseball pitcher.  Origins pirates experience was fun but this was not.

Movement:  The parkour thing is way overplayed in this.  Everything and I mean everything is climbable.  It is incredibly frustrating.  I'm just trying to run down the street and then he suddenly darts off 90 degrees and jumps on a table. I try to get off the table and then he is on a fence, now hes on another fence, now hes climbing a building, now he jumping on top of a person.  The floor is not fucking lava.  Not every object in the entire game has to be climbed on.

Hunting:  This one bothered me the most.  There are so many challenges where you just kill animals over and over.  Many just for their fur and sometimes a trophy.  This was one of the many things the native americans hated about the settlers.  Killing just for fur or fun and leaving so much waste.  Not only does this game make you do it but you also do it as a native american character.  It's extremely disrespectful and an absolute disgrace to attach that behavior to them.

Okay, overall an okay game, but the controls aren't precise enough to really feel good. I was disappointed by the synchronization views as well--they seem to mostly all be churches of modest size, no truly captivating views. Also, the walnut trees you climb to sync are all the exact same tree. This really pulled me out of the game.

Other than that, Ubisoft still includes incredibly frustrating tasks in the game, such as tailing (while remaining a certain distance from the target) and chase scenes (they aren't very fluid feeling).

My scores for this game
Story : 10/10
End of desmond story, the beginning of a new assassin, in this episode we are in America and we are in the era of the American Revolution, and we play two characters, a father and a son./DLC: In this episode, George Washington owns Apple Eden and oppresses, and the story begins. It was fascinating.
Graphics : 9/10
Because I did not see the graphics of the original version, I can not compare the graphics, but the graphics were good and beautiful.
Musics & Sound : 10/10
An assassins creed game and its beautiful songs were city-level dialogues and flawless dialogue, only some parts had few or no subtitles compared to the dialogue.
Details : 9/10
I saw progress in detail, especially hunting animals, and climbing trees.
Gameplay : 8/10
Smooth and easier gameplay, engaging fights, use of firearms, great, especially the naval battles he had.
Variety : 8/10
The main story and game did not have much variety at all, but the DLC had a lot of variety.
Characterization : 7/10
Mr. Connor, I did not know how old he was, but he seemed to be 40 or 50 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Optimization : ⭐/10
The game was too optimal on high (63FPS LOCK)
Multiplayer : ×/10 
×××
Bugs : I did not see any awful bugs, but it did.
Note : Need to connect ubisoft connect
Description : I can easily say that I played a different American Assassins, the world was a good open story, just follows the story very quickly. The only reason I was upset, and these games, why did not the angle under Steam 🤔🤔 one of the reasons that did not last.
Extra : Assassin's Creed Libration Remaster and Full DLC

[b]Sights & Sounds[/b]
- Some character and clothing textures look nicely updated, but a lot of the open world (particularly the Frontier area) looks pretty bad and polygonal
- There are lots of strange visual bugs, ranging from distance fog and water reflection not agreeing, to spagettification of enemy models when you knock them into walls
- The soundtrack is appropriate but not terribly exciting
- Voice acting is largely good, but non-main characters can sound a little wooden

[b]Story & Vibes[/b]
- The setting is intriguing and one of the highlights of the game. Running around the colonial US and taking part in historical events would be fairly engrossing if it weren't for all the immersion-breaking bugs
- For an AC game, there's not much intrigue. It really dampens the emotional impact of the end-of-game events for both Desmond and Connor

[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]
- The flow of combat could be really fun, but the rope darts trivialize the challenge of opponents that can parry your counters or block your attacks
- If combat we're a little more challenging, I think the stealth mechanics would feel a bit more useful
- Skills and abilities aren't necessary since combat isn't hard
- Naval battles were pretty fun
- No real reason to revisit this one after beating it

[b]Overall Impressions[/b]
- I'm far beyond the required specs, and I still had to mess around with process priority/affinity to get rid of frame rate issues each time I booted the game
- Lackluster story and poorly balanced gameplay overshadow the few bright spots

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
- [b]4/10.[/b] Unless you're a diehard who really wants to know the AC lore, maybe consider skipping this entry. If you do play it, maybe consider doing so on console if possible. Playing it on PC is a buggy mess. Hell, you can't even play it at all unless you have AC Odyssey to activate it.",1647754531,1648498842,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Story is good
-Combat mechanics feels quite outdated, but still fun to play, combat animations are cool and satisfying to watch
-Naval missions are fun to play, hating them is alright as they are optional for the most part
-Good soundtracks, battle and chase music is quite amazing

Cons:
-So many bugs, some are minors but some require you to restart the mission to proceed.
-Side missions are very repetitive, just like all the other Ubisoft open world games
-The pacing of main story is awful, the prologue/tutorial part of the main quests is very long that it takes you about 4 hours to complete, which is obviously too much. And the objectives in these missions are often restrictive tedious things such as ""follow xxx"" with forced slow-walking speed or going from here to there that it feels like chores to play. The first few hours can make people who are impatient to instantly hate this game, because most of the time you are watching cutscenes and dialogues without you actually engaging into the game. The tutorials of this game is also poorly done that you can miss out some of the game elements without you actually knowing
-Naval missions are fun, but lacks incentives for people to complete them as they don't really have substantial rewards, playing them is only for fun/completion for the most part.
-Optional objectives in the quest for increasing difficulty of the game, but only if they make senses. Some of the optional objectives in this game are just ridiculous and require you do go all out of your way to do very specific things, especially the one that requires you to air assassinate a single grenadier on a ship full the enemies and blow up two ships without being detected AT THE SAME TIME. They can be very frustrating for perfectionist.
-Very bad UI, looks very bad and is also quite user unfriendly
-Awful horse riding control, horse always stop and stuck at random places, horse cannot jump down a rock of two metres height, it is hilarious how riding a horse ended up wasting my time because horse always refuse to move for whatever reasons and i need to get off the horse and run on foot.
-Enemy detection mechanics can be inconsistent and ruin your missions sometimes.
-The money management of the game is not good enough because you can complete most of the stuffs of the game without actually buying anything from the shops.

Conclusion: Not recommended unless for the sake of completion of the assassin's creed series or you having very high level of tolerancy to a poorly polished game (even though for a game released in 2012).

Now, with the Remastered I could get both for free (as part of the AC: Odyssey), along with Liberation HD a former PlayStation Vita exclusive that made it to be released for the Windows platform as well in 2014. 

Connor and Aveline are likable characters. Connor’s unwavering determination and seriousness makes him the second most believable assassin (the first being Altäir). And Aveline has a certain grace and compassion that all the other female characters lack in the AC lore. She is not just a man in a woman’s body (a murdering machine with cocky demeanor), which seems to be the only way writers can imagine a female hero these days.

Their backstory is relatively well developed, and in Connor’s case he is put in the middle of very important historical events, to play a key role without twisting the real-life events into laughing matter (unlike for example the murder of Julius Caesar in Origins – for me that was an all-time low).

While the voice acting in AC III is spot on (with all the native actors and actresses – dialect coaching from Akwiratékha Martin, who played Connor’s childhood friend in the game – they did an excellent job speaking the language), the replacement of all these native actors and actresses for the DLCs totally ruined the immersion for me (the Kanien'kéha language was totally omitted for the use of English, and the replacement actors were just terrible). 

Lorne Balfe’s score in AC III is memorable, the same cannot be said about Winnifred Philips’ atmospheric music in Liberation.

AC III is a glitch-ridden disaster. And to top it off it comes with the most agonizingly hard mission constraints to get 100% synch. Some of the optional objectives seem to depend on luck to trigger, or to avoid glitches. Liberation on the other hand is the exact opposite. It’s an AC game on smaller scale, simplified with a no-frills approach to accommodate the handheld device it was developed for, making it one of the best gaming experiences of the whole series. Not to mention that the addition of character personas with different notoriety levels is a great game element, that would have change the perception of all the other installments of the series. Imagine a world where a hooded figure armed to the teeth cannot just blend in with the pedestrians just by sitting on a bench... Right?

The King Washington DLCs are just plain awful. Rehashed locations filled with next to no content, almost lifeless and torturously repetitive.  

Let me mention that the game’s list of Uplay Achievements represent an unbalanced mixture of tasks way to easy and outright impossible. Things like Original Gamer (even with all the help I could find winning those games remain a dream), An Extraordinary Man (endless hours – look at my total playing time – of observation and people like Norris who is a major gold brick make it impossible to finish. Whenever I try to scan him, he is just sitting on his porch shining his helmet or has his helmet shined by Sheena the Queen of the Jungle.), Coureus Des Bois (Hunting? Great. Plant a snare, add some bait and wait for target rabbit to come. Okkkeeey. Except every single time a stupid deer comes and ruins the trap. Every f**ing time. Or a peacefully feeding elk starts running the second I aim at them with my bow. Holding the bow and aiming at something else is OK, though. Also, running in the woods is about stumbling from quick time event to quick time event, because everything that moves wants a piece of Connor's tenderloin.

Controls are bad as ever. Running activates the parkour whenever I'm close to objects. So instead of running ahead Connor/Aveline jumps on the vendor's table... Well done, Ubisoft. Tackling from above option simply doesn't appear. Connor can't tackle from above. Hangs instead.

And the point of this Remaster? The graphics. The biggest letdown. I personally barely see any difference apart from the option of 4K. And the characters are way uglier then in the original. The remake craziness had reached the gaming industry too, resulting in projects like this one, where the developer just phoned it in instead of a quality upgrade.

Shame. Get it for free if you can.

One quick note before I continue with the review: I haven’t played the original games, so when I’m reviewing [i]Assassin’s Creed III Remastered[/i], I won’t be able to comment on how they compare to the updated versions.

It’s rare to review two games at once but after finishing both of them, I was surprised how similar my feelings were about both of them. To be more precise, I’m equally disappointed by both. But I’m getting ahead of myself, so let’s brush up on the basics first.

[i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] and [i]Assassin’s Creed: Liberation[/i] both released on the same day in the October of 2012. Yes, this means that we once again only got a year between the release of the previous [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] title ([i]Revelations[/i] in this case) and the new one – or in this case, two. While [i]Liberation[/i] was a PlayStation Vita-only title at first, [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] made its debut on the “big” consoles as well as PC.

What’s really important here is that [i]Liberation[/i] was made with a handheld device in mind. As such, a lot of design decisions had to be made to accommodate the hardware. The menus, the size of the in-game world and of course features that didn’t make it over from [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] (like naval battles). Even with a (slightly) new coat of paint, you will notice that [i]Liberation[/i] is a much smaller game in scope and doesn’t really feel at home on the big screen - but more on that later.

Let’s talk about the game that’s really the focus of this Remaster package first: [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i]. Not only did it introduce a lot of changes (a more “modern”  settings, overhauled gameplay options like free-running as well as new addions such as naval battles or hunting) but it was also intended as the conclusion to the modern-day Desmond arc that has been ongoing since the very first [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i].

So, as the previous [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] mainline games started to get kind of stale (especially in regards to gameplay) – does [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] manage to revitalize the franchise? Hahahahaha - no.

Almost all of the new additions are really not that great. The free-running and close combat overhaul doesn’t do that much – you’re still occasionally jumping up obstacles when you just wanted to sprint by for example and just countering enemy moves is usually enough. Thanks to dual-wielding, we can now use guns – but as they take a lot of time reload, you’ll mostly just use them once per encounter.

As for actually new features, we got activities like hunting (why?) or catching flying book pages. Oh, hey, remember the empty field parts of Rome during [i]Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood[/i]? The ones that are just a pain to pass as there’s nothing there? Yeah, Ubisoft expanded upon that: with the introduction of the Wilderness, you can look forward to much more forest to run through in order to get to the next mission. Fast-travel points are still a thing but at least you can now fast-travel FROM everywhere – even if I’d have preferred fast-travel TO everywhere as well.

Speaking of travelling, you’ll do that. A lot. I feel like I spent most of my time doing the story missions just running around & occasionally killing a few enemies with the same moves as always. That has been a problem with the previous [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] titles as well - but thanks to the bigger areas (& the Wilderness), it’s only gotten worse. We got our horses back again, but they still like to get stuck and can’t cross rivers. Some help you are, mount.

Ultimately, even with all the new things, I still felt like I was playing the exact same game as the predecessors. All the new features and side activities might look nice on paper but as I was working through the main story, I felt like I was stuck in a timeloop. I reached the end of the game thinking that I didn’t even feel like I made any progress – protagonist Connor was as powerful as before and I didn’t even bother switching up my combat style since the tutorial – because there was simply no need.

There’s one last thing I need to mention about the gameplay of [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] though and that are of course the new navel battles. These are probably my favourite part of the game, as they are a) genuinely different from the rest of the game and b) a lot of fun to play. It’s probably no coincidence that the sequel, [i]Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flack[/i], doubled down on them.

What probably bothers me the most about [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] is the wasted potential – especially in regard to storytelling. A Native American as a protagonist, the story set during 1760 – 1783 – those are event rarely covered in videogames and I was genuinely interested in how the story might turn out.

The answer is extremely bad. In terms of settings, for example, if you don’t know the exact historical backgrounds, the game is doing very little to set things up for you (short fact sheet entries aren’t a good way to do so). That’s not really new for the franchise but I feel like it’s gotten even more extreme here. But besides not really expanding on some of the setting as much as I’d have liked it to (Native American culture for example, is barely a part of the main story) – the fictional parts aren’t good either. Pacing issues, lots of head-scratcher moments, events and characters being all over the place – after a promising start I only wished for the entire thing to end a few chapters in. 

Naturally, Ubisoft managed to squander the modern-day plot once again as well. We actually do get some Desmond gameplay sections this time around but ultimately, I don’t even know why I bothered with the previous games if they lead up to this. Not to mention Ubisoft actually put in another cliffhanger ending. If I didn’t have so little space, I could complain about the story of [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] for hours, it’s easily the worst part of the game considering how great it could’ve been.

Unfortunately, [i]Liberation[/i] doesn’t fare much better. As with its big brother, the plot is an aimless mess and the historical setting neglected to the point that it sometimes just serves as background flavour. With Aveline de Grandpré, we got a female protagonist of colour, which makes for a more than a welcome change – but I feel like her entire potential has unfortunately not been realised here.

Gameplay-wise, as mentioned before, [i]Liberation[/i] really is limited by its original hardware. It feels like many cuts had to be made in order to still offer something resembling an [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] game – and as such, the game really is nothing more than a stripped [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] experience. I wish this spin-off was less interested in imitating the mainline series and did something more original, like expanding on the new clothes changing mechanic. That way, we might’ve gotten a genuinely interesting game instead of just a hollow copy.

Concluding, both games featured in [i]Assassin’s Creed III Remastered[/i] ultimately turned out to be huge let-downs. It was genuinely frustrating to see the promising concepts turn out this way. Both games could’ve been so much more but all we got is just more [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] in a way. If that’s still enough for you, go ahead and buy them (be aware that they’re also part of the [i]Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey[/i] season pass though). If not – maybe play [i]Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag[/i] for the only good thing that came out of instead: naval combat.",1647474155,1647474270,False,5,2,0.517808258533477783,0,True,False,False

The fifth Assassin's Creed game, confusingly named Assassin's Creed III makes you take the reigns of Conner, also known as Ratonhnhaké:ton, A native who after having his village destroyed and family slaughtered by Templars, joins the creed of Assassin's. You play through Conner's journey of training to his eventual influence and work within the American revolution and the fight against the British regulars. With such an interesting topic, does it live up to all the hype? Lets get into it.

[h1] [b] The Good [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Story [/b]

- The Assassin's Creed games have always had extremely interesting, immersive, and unique stories crafted to not only highlight historical periods but also tell a fictional tale of the Templar/Assassin conflict and their influence on the world. AC3 is no different as you play as Conner,  a native american who is thrown into the middle of the Templar/Assassin conflict, which is also at the time disguising as the American revolution. 

[*] [b] The Combat [/b]

- In a game about assassins, the combat has to be strong. Thankfully, AC3 does nothing but improve the combat compared to earlier games, as well as introducing many new tools, weapon types, and fighting styles that make AC3 one of the few games that I purposely go out of my way to decimate enemies rather than simply get to where I need to go. 

[*] [b] The Graphics and Design [/b]

- AC3 is the most beautiful and graphically improved Assassin's Creed games so far in the series, not to add the remaster which vastly improves the characters looks and various other elements. The serene, virgin land of colonial America is a rarely used setting for games and it is just as enthralling to look at as you'd think.

[*] [b] The Naval Gameplay [/b]

- AC3 introduces a revolutionary gameplay mechanic to the series, which is naval combat. New to the series, taking over a large seafaring vessel and bringing justice to the seas in one of the shining stars of AC3. Not to mention this amazing gameplay mechanic is what would inevitably influence the creation of Assassin's Creed Black Flag.

[*] [b] The Homestead [/b]

- AC3 adds another expansive gameplay and immersion mechanic which is the homestead. You can recruit talented individuals into a community you are building which not only allows additional stories, collectibles, and building mechanics but also allows you to access crafting and new equipment mechanics as well as trading routes. This allows you to immerse yourself farther into the world than any Assassin's Creed game so far.

[h1] [b] The Bad [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Tiny Glitches [/b]

- As far as I can tell from talking to others, the glitches present in AC3 seem to actually stem from the remaster, rather than the game in general. This is not uncommon as many remasters tend to bring in countless new problems. Playing through the game you'll see plenty of glitches, some entertaining and some irritating. Horses getting stuck in the ground, launch glitches, and dozens of model glitches which distort and mess up mainly enemies and sometimes allies. 

[*] [b] The Camera Angles [/b]

- A common problem for me in Assassin's Creed games, AC3 does not improve and continues to shove you into locked and completely disorienting camera angles and the seemingly worst possible times. Whether force locking your view while preforming menial actions or forcing you to do intense parkour while your camera faces away from your  desired destination, thus forcing you to fail jumps or launches, these camera angles can be the most irritating things in the world

[h1] [b] The Ugly [/b] [/h1]

[*] [b] The Game-Breaking Glitches and General Problems [/b]

- AC3 Remastered's fatal flaw is its annoying amount of problems in it's general gameplay, and the countless game-breaking glitches it boasts. There will be dozens of missions where you will fail multiple times because it spawns you in a broken location, or you fall through the map, or you spawn detected by enemies thus making you fail and respawn which traps you in an endless loop of failure. Then you have to restart entire sections and waste hours. The game inevitably breaks your will and then you give up for a while. The original AC3 wasn't broke like this. The remaster did this, and that is unforgivable.

[h1] [b] Overall [/b] [/h1]

AC3 is still a great game, and one of my favorite Assassin's Creed games. However, AC3 Remastered has broken my bond with the game, made it more irritating to play than fun, and overall just ruined the game. If you want to play AC3, just get the regular version not the remaster.",1630960196,1646591146,False,74,3,0.766973614692687988,0,True,False,False

- The auto-parkour is incredibly clunky. Connor will magnet himself to random ledges and walls even if you never meant to. The game will try to pretend it knows what you want to do and fail at doing so.
- The lighting is completely broken. Some parts of the game are too bright and some parts are too dark to the point that they are unplayable. The animals in the forest look like plastic toys when the light hits their body.
- ""Optional"" objectives but will tell you the mission is incomplete if you don't fulfill them. Not to mention, you WILL keep restarting checkpoints if you wish to fulfill them and the game will put you to unfavorable positions when you do. Also, some optional objective are just straight up BS. Pair that with terrible AI and clunky physics, you're sure to have a terrible time fulfilling them.

If you're playing the series for completion's sake, just rush through the story in this one. Playing the rest of the game is not worth your time.",1646158335,1646158335,False,3,2,0.40685543417930603,0,True,False,False

What i genuinely question is how Assassins Creed 2, Brotherhood and Revelations which were all made before this outshine this game in every conceivable way and not only that but this game was also remastered meaning Ubisoft you had a chance to fix this game and make it better instead it feels like its regressed even more id dare even say that the first Assassins creed was less broken then this. I feel such frustration playing this that if it wasn't for the story line keeping me interested i would have given up this game already i mean for gods sake after the entire Ezio Trilogy, Yes the bar was set high but goddamn its like you forgot where that bar was because this game is shambolic and the worst part is ive still got to play Rebellion Remastered which means ill no doubt return to this review and have to say that even Rebellion was ruined in this remaster. Ubisoft you had potential and its like you just gave up on this game and thought, there we go a few tweaks in graphics and that'll do leaving it only just about playable. Also i wonder why were so many game mechanics like buying shops and all scrapped after the previous 3 games and not only this but that half your items you never use outside of the tutorial that teaches you how to use them, realistically its just your melee, hidden blade and pistol and that's about all you use all game. Thank god i got 2 games for this price making them both around 15 quid because otherwise you would have to be mad to pay 30 quid for just 1 game especially if this is the quality we're getting.
I finished AC3 and honestly i still stand by everything ive said up until this point and what was the point of all the build up towards the ending if it was so anticlimactic like its actually pathetic how poor the ending is compared to how much it was hyped up.",1645930640,1646046045,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i was kind of annoyed with the game because for some reason they changed the controls for this after the last 4 games were all the same? and you cant bind anything with controller. but it was an okayish learning curve atleast. 
connor is annoying, the game has buggy character clipping at times. and you probably still need to play the at 60Hz
oh and half the shit in the game you dont even use outside of the tutoral that ""showed you"" in the first place. no more worrying about medicine and your hp, no more armor, no more buying shops, no more worrying about posters and bribing people just isnt necessary to do.

the gameplay and story wise make it a pretty decent game. nothing in here makes me wish that i hadnt played it.. and ive played it twice now if that means anything to you. 

that being said this was still miles better than the first assassins creed game.

I have not played the original one, so I cannot make a comparison.
Game, weather physics, snow, atmosphere, they nailed it. Naval missions were amazing.
Combat was very hard to get used to, but it worked out just fine in the end, and let me tell you, finishers are brutal.
But story is stupid, I did not liked it at all, characters are knowing important informations out of the blue, writing is just frustrating. The story of Desmond kinda ended abruptly, no justice to the character at all.
Connor is one dimensional robot with no charisma and emotions, and only likeable character was Haytham.
Soundtracks are not memorable, liked only main theme and that is all.
Apart from cringe virtue signaling and social justice this game is good, and I recommend it to all.

Assassin's Creen 3

The game sucked balls really hard the first time around when it came out and it does the same with the remaster.

The new charcter we play as is named RatAmageddon, don't know why they decided to name a character rat but what do i know. The Rat is the most annoying character in the series as far. The Rat is really naive and childish. The Rat is more bland than Altair, don't know how they managed that but they did.

The story is all over the place. They expect us to know who some people are and appear one mission then dissappear for ever. The Rat has a bone to pick with George Washington for some reason even before he ordered a hit on his home.

I'm not an expert in indian language but it feels really off, like they hired some knockoff voice actors for the parts.

I love the people of the homestead, really liked their little stories.

I still hate how they removed the rpg elements from the Ezio series with the armor upgrades.

I did pull through and got 100% even tho the naval missions were so annoying considering the ship is really slow. So glad they improved it in AC 4


The Tyranny of King Washington

I liked the powers, but hated the story. What's up with so many dammed wolves everywhere, they kept attacking all the time.

This time around his mother gets a bit more screen time and what a eye sore it was with how annoying she was.

I encountered so many bugs while doing convoy side missions it's nuts they even called this a remaster.


Liberation

Omg what is this. Story doesn't make an sense, you move through out the years with no reason why. The start of the game doesn't explain anything and just jumps a good couple of years. I wrote better stories when i was 7, this game was a disgrace 

I don't know how they managed but they made The Rat boy shine compared to this carboard face looking joke of a main character. Even npcs have better animated faces than the main character.

The ending was a cliche joke.

Don't bother with liberation, it's boring.

Works just fine to me, no technical issues from what i can tell.

Liberation is too long for a bad short story. Not well delivered. Gameplay is okayish.

(Text below is a rant. After a week of bickering i picked it up again, and suddenly i'm in the flow.
It got to me, and i will 100% this game i'm sure. BTW don't believe any of the fairytales that you can complete the game in 15-ish hours. No fucking way. ACIII is MUCH better than Black Flag. At this time Connor is on par with Ezio. ACIII is one of the best AC games, let me tell you why people think it's not, and what my gripes with the game are, and why i still think it's one of the most ambitious and fun AC-games to play:

Remastered III is very good and sometimes terrible. Though much more lineair and much more unpolished than other AC games, it still got me. The bugs are super annoying, and the sum of its parts gives a very frustrating but fun experience, especially when you are set loose in the world. It's nice, and the scope of all the different assets is beyond me. There's so much going on! (There is naval combat, land battles, managing etc.) This one also shows that Ubisoft doesn't give a *** about the afterlife of its games. All the annoying issues are still in this remaster, Synching is a chore, you're often fighting against the controls and systems of the game itself. Instead of showcasing your skills, you're hoping for the best. Hopefully Connor won't attach itself to a pole, instead of running to catch someone. Or that you'll shoot your bow, instead of suddenly jumping and attacking in the midst of an army. These issues have always been in Ac games, but this time around, ai 'thinks' it knows what the player wants to do. Instead of three buttons for parcour, you only use 2. Therefore the game thinks it's smarter, but it takes away control of the player. Your stupid horse will 'know' what you want it to do! Except it won't. MY god the horses are terrible. 
I completely abandoned 100% synching. The different parts of the game seem glued together, hoping for the best. Parcour is another beast in the ttrees than rooftops. It works, but not really. Only barely. I couldn't care less about the story after some missions, there are simply too many characters and i have no clue who is who. Especially on my side of the fight. They are scarcely introduced and suddenly i know exactly who my mates are? Very weird. But after a few missions suddenly the story felt engaging and apart from Connor being a very shallow character, the journey is worth it. More and more the world opens up and different aspects of the game come to fruition. Even though it asks for a lot (a LOT) of patience, it gives its rewards eventually, when it clicks. But the sound glitches, uneven dialogue, bugs and terrible mission structure (execution) and efficacy of the different systems make me NOT encourage you to buy it full priced. Or buy the Odyssey Season Pass instead and you'll get this one for free. 

The sounds are awful. It goes from very loud to very soft. Sometimes the music is not to be heared and then suddenly BLAM there it is! Same with speech, too loud and too hard. Sometimes whole passages of speech are cut off, because the cutscene requires something else. (I know it has to do with the mixing, when you lower volume of speech, the music suddenly can hit very hard during battle. It's hard to get an even sound) Of course Ubisoft says that i have to upload savefiles and they'll look into it. But of course they won't! It won't make money to solve the issues right? Even though 100's of players experience the same issues.
MY advice is, leave everything on 10 and just deal with the volume of speech here and there. 

The first 2-3 hours of the game i simply adore. It is the most filmographic intro of a game, and it sets the mood perfectly. But after that the game just loses much of its charm, only to get better when you're wandering the land, doind sidestuff and picking up the sotry whenever you choose. There comes a time it will grip you.

When did i stop playing?
The moment Connor starts a row, when Washington is holding a speech and you have two separate dialogues intermingle and fuck up the scene, is when i thought. Ok, this is too bad.
Why do you have a setting like this? First of Connor doesn't know Lee is there when only 10 people are present??? Then you as a game designer think it is a good idea to have TWO different conversations at the same time in a cutscene is a good way of tewlling a story??
That is the moment i quit the game, never to return.

An important note. It seems the world has been deliberately developed to restrain you from flowing nicely through it. F.E. There's a mission where you have to tail someone and steal his belongings, never have i seen so many dogs (steal = e, pet = e) in the street. So everytime i tried to nick belongings i was petting a dog instead. When i wanted to turn to hide, suddenly there was a wall of barrels that avoided me to do so. There are countless examples that show that the mission is quite straightforward, but the barriers to oevrcome to get the point are deliberately there. Example: freerrunning, when you have to follow a person. There are birds on roofs that means you can jump down in a haystack. When i follow the route and jump down where the birds are, i miss the haystack, because it is slightly to the right and my freerun parcours is to the left. So i have to start again. It is clear these decisions are deliberate. One last example, s simple one. There are viewpoints that are OPEN at the top, so you'll ALWAYS first enter them before you manage to climb one of the small pillars on top. Talking about the top, sometimes you cannot climb the small ornament. Sometimes you can.

However a week later i picked it up again, and it got me hooked, and it won't let go. Connor has his own outfit, i do missions here and there. I'll just look passed the bugs as much as possible, i'll skip horseriding and just do my thing. I'm loving it, again. (Still Ubi should adress bugs. No question about it)
This is a perfect example of a failed remaster, and it shows the personality of a company like Ubisoft.
A shame, because the setting, even though not very AC-like, is a wonderful one to explore bug-free.

As it stands, it is a very flawed game that tries to do a lot at the same time, in the process losing the charm and mystique of the first 4 Ac games. But Connor being an Native Terminator, hacks through the story like butter, and for all it's worth, i'm having a decent amount of fun (and frustration. Luckily the axe takes care of that)

LAst notes: The spawnrate and detection of enemies are ludicrous.
And whomever thought collecting WHITE almanak pages in a SNOWYWHITE environment was a good idea, needs to be put down immediately.",1642951946,1643496487,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
911400,108649969,76561198062727875,0,83,2450,0,1118,1643485671,"Stealth in this Assassin's game is by far the worst I've played.   It seems enemies will detect you for hiding in a bush somewhere on a Battle field, just by stealth killing whoever walked past.  They're literally unaware of your presence, but as soon as you press Assassinate on the closet target, everyone is somehow alert, that their buddy was silently, ""Silently"" killed. 

As for the Remastered version of Assassin's Creed III, it does look better, but from what I've heard the Story following Connor was supposed to be more depressed like, but in the Remaster from others, the visuals look too colorful to be serious.  But, I don't really mind the colors they've added, brings more life to the game, but that's my opinion.


  To top it off, the Devs have Unlisted the Original Assassin's Creed III from Steam, so now you can't get the OG game, you're forced to buy the HD version.   Apparently the Original AC III had less bugs and glitches than the Remastered has, and that's not good, lol!  You made a HD Remaster, but included more bugs than you had, oof my guy.


  As for Combat, I enjoy it, but I suck at it, lol!  I had to look up a guide on how to actually play properly.   I feel ashamed, lol!  I'm not a True Assassin, I'm like Connor, someone who found out about the brotherhood and goes on a reckless rampage of Murder, and besides him, I get my Arse handed to me.


I have to state my opinion on the Notoriety system in Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation, that if you're playing as slave Aveline, and you are climbing buildings or you pickpocket someone, you will gain notoriety to yourself, stating, Hey, you just did a bad so people are suspicious of you.  The Game counts it as you gained a suspicious level, even if no guards were around to feel the need to keep an eye on you, it gains the level even with Civilians.  I find that to be the dumbest system.   The Developers really thought, ""This is a realistic system, lets add that to the game.""   I think how the Notoriety system should work, is if ANY guard or guards see's you do anything of an illegal act, THEN you should get a suspicious level of caution, not when no one was around to witness it, TF?


   My Final Review for ACIII but for ACIII Liberation.   I must say I've played and beaten Liberation before on the Playstation Vita, when I thought the Voice acting  and combat was good, lol!   I gotta say, the voice acting is absolutely HORRIBLE!  There are times I cannot take the characters seriously, because it just sounds like the actor had hardly any practice in Voice Acting.   The Combat, it's literally the same as Assassin's Creed III when you play as Haythem in the beginning, there's no Original take on the Combat.  As for the Graphic overhaul, it's decent, but not a spectacular improvement, but better than it was on the PSVita being all Pixelated and low resolution.   The Story is mainly about Aveline who's mother left her when she was just a child, but she apparently had a good reason for this, which the game is awful at telling the story, or ""Stories"" of the past.  The whole game you go through freeing slaves and taking back your rights.  Aveline at a young age was taken into the Assassin's Brotherhood, but she had no idea what she was getting into, but her master trained her anyways.  Again, the game doesn't go into A lot of detail of why all of this is happening, it just expects you to know by playing, and or reading information you pick up along the way in the Notes the game gives you.  But, who wants to read hours of notes, we want a Prequal!   It's a shame the Devs didn't include a Prequal to Aveline's life in a DLC to the DLC of ACIII.   This is a new Story and Character, but it takes place in the same years as Assassin's Creed III, so that's why it's mainly just a DLC.  They don't show in Assassin's Creed III Connor meeting with Aveline, because my guess is that it would be longer than intended, but it shows in Liberation Aveline meets Connor, probably before Connor goes on his journey of stopping Charles Lee, and his Father Haythem, which we don't learn anything about his father till you play Assassin's Creed Rogue, but that review is for a different day.",1642980291,1643487024,False,7,1,0.544914662837982178,0,True,False,False

Parkour in these older assassin's creed games is sloppily done, especially when playing on a mouse and keyboard. The combat is boring and easy, just mash E and you will never die. The only way to die in this game is by the parkour system fucking up and running off of a rooftop by accident. There are a huge amount of bugs in this game. The game actually ran fine for me but there are lots of bugs like chase sequences getting broken, animals and some enemies becoming impossible to hit and non-responsive to the world, and one fun one where my ship hit a rock and just instantly sunk even though I had over half my armor remaining. 

Moreover, this game constantly craps on Connor, the protagonist, by basically smearing it in your face via epilogues that the Templars were exactly right with their evaluation of the colonists and their government. Connor fights the templars to save his people? Too bad, you get a few lines of dialogue from a random NPC saying the whole tribe moved west because the american government sold their land. Connor fights the templars to ensure freedom for all in the colonies? Too bad, you get a 4 second glimpse at a slave auction as the british ships are pulling away. All of this is historically accurate, but it's handled so poorly and hamfistedly and it makes Connor seem like a complete tool in the end. His entire fight is rendered pointless in two brief cut scenes. It takes someone who is a better writer than I, and certainly smarter and more talented than the writers at Ubisoft, to acknowledge the complicated history surrounding the American government and its relationship to the native americans and african americans. They could have sprinkled these sorts of events throughout the game to really force Connor to evaluate what he's fighting for and whose side he should be on, if either at all, but no. Ubisoft just shits all over their own protagonist. And then they release an idiotic DLC about George Washington becoming king, ya know, the one thing George Washington constantly opposed, to the extent that he wouldn't allow people to address him with any titles or regal formalities.

Always hated the Full Sync bullshit. They could have added more checkpoints. I have to keep restarting missions just because I missed some ""optional objective"" near the end of it. And, often, the optional objectives would bug out after reloading a checkpoint (which most of the times takes you to the start of the mission) so it becomes impossible to complete it.

Haytham is great, and Liberation is actually really worth your time and it's a damn shame more of those features (and Avelline) didn't stick around. But the actual game of 3?

It isn't good. It was never good. It's story is anywhere between bland and motivated only by everyone involved being stubborn idiots (apart from when Haytham comes back, where the writing gets some life in it again thanks to him), as one of three people who really liked the Desmond story it gets so sidelined for what was blatantly supposed to be a focus at some stage in development... it's a mess. The 'cities' don't have the same fun actor to just run-around in as they used to, likely a result of them being frontier towns rather than bustling metropolises with narrow roofs, and while the tree running is nice it's not really used to all that great effect because it's easier and often times better to just get a horse and run along.
Anything this game did well, was done better by Black Flag. Everything this game did poorly would become endemic to the series.

From a writers standpoint it feels like they were unhappy covering the setting, but who knows for sure.
To speak of the issues AC3 has in playability, the game suffers bugs, stealth is almost impossible due to the AI noticing you virtually immediately every time, and more of what is echoed throughout the reviews. While I disagree about some of the comments on graphics, believing that the game does look ok for a remaster, I can't recommend this title on that alone. Trying to complete the game just for the story was a complete slog and almost painfully tedious.

But this is still an AC game. There's lots of fun to be had sneaking up on people, getting into trouble, gathering the collectable items. Connor is a good protagonist, and the story is one of the stronger in the series for both ancestor and Desmond missions. 

There is plenty of exposition as to why Connor is going down the path he is, which you will either love or hate. The dual-prologues can be a little slow, and this often gatekeeps people interest in the game. They are a slog if you're not terribly interesting in the world or characters.

The ship battles are god awful and good luck maneuvering with the damn thing at any given time. The on land combat isn't as bad, but the break defense ability is basically pointless since pretty much anyone it needs to be used on can block it. The free running is disgusting as well, I've pointed forward with the joystick while trying to jump to a building right in front of me and it instead decides to jump way off the camera to the right? Horrible game design, I honestly want to learn how to code and design things like this just so I can fix it. Then we're not even gonna talk about the god awful graphics (how a remaster manages to have even worse graphics than its original game I'll never know). I like Connor, he's not my favorite by any means, but I liked the thought of a Native American assassin. Connor's story isn't that good imo, but the modern day story with Desmond and the rest (which I'm normally not a fan of) is actually quite good in this game. It's possible it seems better to me since the modern storyline isn't being outshined by its historical storyline, like with Brotherhood where the historical part of the game with Ezio is so good, it feels odd to ""pause"" it and go into a completely different storyline with Desmond, despite how intriguing the storyline with him is. I want to like this game, and I want to cross it off the list of the few AC games I have left to play (if I got through Origins I thought I could get through this), but with the way the gameplay is, I can't, and for the sake of a future player's sanity, I can't recommend this game to anyone.

I had fun revisiting the game, as this was one of my favorite games when it first came out. Its not a great Assassin's Creed game by any stretch of the imagination even, but there are fun set pieces and missions (Sequences 6, 7, 9, 10). Recommend it if you haven't played it before, or you tie a LOT of nostalgia to this game (like I do).

Note: I 100% this game about 9 years ago when it came out over ~150 hours, so I only went through the main story. 

Time played: 19 hours (Full Sync, rushing through modern day missions)
The Good: Fun missions, good stealth, decent graphics, good story, great villains.
The Bad: Visual bugs (hoodless, bald Conner in early sequences), stiff protagonist (not nearly as bad as he's made out to be though), not a great remaster, why remaster this and not Black Flag? 

Recommend?: Yes if you haven't played it and like stealth/ classic Assassin's Creed, or are super nostalgic for it. Dont pay full price though, its not worth the 40 dollar ask up front. Wait until its on sale for half or more off. 

Will I go back to 100% it?: Probably not. Not dying to replay all the boring Homesteam and Liberation missions, but if you're into those, it'll stretch for a total of like 50-60 hours for a 100% run.",1640220234,1640220353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game description key-points: Remastered? it`s not what I`ve been expecting to see and play!

Overview:
2021+ remastered version released in 2019 is like playing a bad looking game from 2010, just shocking to discover such inferior content (in reference to the original version, by release year), after playing Origins and Odyssey :(

nether-less that`s not all, after checking visual differences between original and remastered version, I left even more disappointed.
new version has more polishing and details with lights, but the worst part it`s like all the items were wrapped in a plastic bag. so synthetic and un-realistically everything looks as the result.

Thumb down, bad team and poor designing work.",1639538057,1639538057,False,25,5,0.535017073154449463,0,True,False,False

The AI makes it almost impossible to complete any stealth related optional objectives for 100% synchronization.

Have an objective where you need to perform an air assassination but also need to remain undetected? Well you can't because every time you do the guards on the other side of the map detect you with their ""super sonic hearing"" forcing you to restart from a checkpoint.

THIS HAPPENS WITH EVERY KIND OF STEALTH ASSASSINATION exception for passive ones (walking behind someone who is isolated and using the hidden blade to assassinate them).

It also concludes the story for the search of the precursor sites and explains the origin story of these mysterious artifacts. In terms of the story, the concept was fascinating but, its execution was a bit dull with the exposure to characters beings rushed. They were all there to move the story along and were pretty much forgetful after that.

In terms of gameplay, there were many changes. Now the game focuses on base up-gradation for revenue generation rather than buying up landmarks or shops. I prefer the old system as the new one makes it hard to generate revenue as generating revenue is now like a side game that you need to play if you want money apart from the chests. Also, upgrading weapons become pointless because if you are good at countering, the weapons stats are insignificant. The one thing I like to hear is the introduction of naval combat. Getting to experience the open seas was a fresh change to the usual city settings. Also, now we can climb and move using trees, which is interesting as it makes playing the game more fun. The DLC also brought back the feel of Prince of Persia with all those epic powers.

Assassinations felt sloppy and not well thought out. For example when Connor kills Haytham, Connor only wishes him farewell, unlike in Ezio's case that is his whole character arc for AC2. Money is absolutely useless in this game. Dont bother going to the store in any of the cities as all the items are locked, to expensive and provide zero advantage. Enemies can appear out of nowhere and characters struggle to climb up simple stairs. In group fights, Connor or Haytham's fighting style is extremely broken, you can just climb two steps vertically away from the enemy and the game counts that as an assassination kill and they die immediately. Quite funny tho. There are some cool moments so i do recommend it to people who want to just finish the Doomsday Storyline like myself. However, the missions are very boring and lack originality. strong 4.5/10

edit: after some debate, the narrative provides a strong twist at the start and continues on to be a very interesting tale of how Connor is struggling with his own identity and to dewcide what the best course of action is for the greater good of either his people, or the american colonies. When he is forced to kill Haytham to pursue his goals, it is clear that he does not want to do so but yet has to as he has a strong moral compass. This is all the more devastating when he has to bear witness to his vilage being destroyed, showing us that regardless of what course of action we take, destiny still comes, whether good or bad. 6/10",1636725608,1637948875,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I actually liked AC III a lot. The combat, and especially the barbaric ways of Connor's killings were marvellous. He was a machine that could break an enemy in half if he willed to. Very graphic fatalities, and masterfully done movement with all weapons (especially the tomahawk). 
The story was not weak, but it took TOO LONG to get the assassin connor, cuz you started as his father Haytham, then a connor boy, then a teen Connor and THEN at 5th sequence (after like 3 hours) an assassin Connor. I didnt like that Connor was so easily manipulated by his just-found father. Very toxic behavior by him, and i cant understand how Connor that saw his mother burn, and filled with rage and desire for revenge could let him do this to him. It just does not make sense. nvm
The recruit system was average. The naval battles and sea roaming was average but as a  new thing it's understandable. The wild roaming and weather change were well made. The hunting was boring and unecessary to do. It had the WORST video transition in AC history; it was just gameplay>black screen>video... nvm. The cities and the blend mechanic were decent. I loved that the natives were speaking their native language, very fresh and unique. Especially when connor was killing a target; the quotes were catchy. All in all, a very decent ac game. 
7,5/10.
As for AC liberation, it was crap. it was pathetic, it was boring as old fuck. 1 hour was too much to this shit.

For the then-climactic entry in a blockbuster series that had come to be among the forerunners of the seventh generation, it has never ceased to amaze me that they chose to do a soft reset on so many plot points, hunting down yet another MacGuffin to open the exact same door they hunted a MacGuffin for two games ago, as the very epitome of 'making it up as you go along' storytelling.

Each protagonist has individually interesting elements, but none get enough time in the sun to get a satisfying arc. Similarly, each conflict told over the game's twenty hours is underdeveloped and undercooked, leaving the whole experience feeling like a mishmash YouTube compilation of the Revolutionary War's greatest hits, featuring Ubisoft's OC. Characters will come and go with no greater purpose in the plot than a referential nod like 'Oh wow that's Ben Franklin! You know who that is, don't you? Isn't that awesome?' What few characters that do possess a hint of staying power are either killed off unceremoniously or completely forgotten about as the game reaches its closing chapters. The entire story feels rushed, unfinished, and by far the least satisfying in the series to date.

None of that is why I don't recommend this game.

I can say without reservation that this is among the buggiest software Ubisoft has ever released. Rain and thunder will constantly fill your ears even when it's shining daylight outside. Ships will blink out of existence on the high seas. The main character will hitch and hobble over every little thing on the road. NPC's faces look like they're carved from rock with googly eyes pasted on. Objective markers will glitch halfway across the map to the opposite end of where you should be going. I lost my bow eight hours into the game, leaving it floating in the air after a battle. 'No big deal,' I thought. Surely a reboot or reload would get it back. No such luck. None in sifting through the weapon stash either. A quick search online revealed that not only was this an issue in the original's PC release, it made its way on to the Remastered version without hindrance, and there is still ***no way whatsoever to fix it.***

That gross negligence in quality pushed me to do what I so rarely pursue in video games. I chased the main questline down with a single-minded determination to burn through it as quickly as possible. I have fond memories of the Homestead side missions culminating in one of my favorite moments in the whole series, but in this version, I couldn't care less for seeing it. 

This game has redeeming qualities hidden in the muck, and as far as the original release goes, there are so many bright ideas that are so painfully executed with a lack of time and ability, that this really is the worst type of bad game, in my opinion. It's something that tries so hard to be the definitive entry in a series, yet ends up being the worst.

The game isn't bad, But there's a good many things i hated still.  The assassins recruit leveling system is damn near impossible at first, Why in the world did they get away from brotherhoods and revelations recruit leveling system? They was perfect! Another thing i do not like is the recipe for getting certain weapons or the ubisoft points you gotta do to get some weapon or outfits, just dumb imo as you have to basically wait all the way to sequence 10 to get some of these homestead missions to get the material to make the weapons. Which in return makes the combat a little weird facing the bigger guys (not terrible tho), Staying on weapons,  Why is there no armor to buff your health in this game? This is the only AC game with no health buffs SMFH.... Some times the bow would get glitchy with the reflex shot and would just keep shooting for me. Just a few problems with the mechanics of the game.  The story was decent at most, Haythem was easily the best part, Once connor came along i again lost all interest in the story till haythem came along again, Conor just comes off as too niave and stupid for a assassin with too much blood lust for charles lee and that NEVER changes....  The upside to this game tho,  The setting is pretty good.  Little spacious at times and a lot of running (need a horse caller like brotherhood had as it only called for a horse in the frontier for me). And the remastered graphics looked really well in places but some spots was too dark or too bright. Just at the end of the day, I found myself rushing through this game as much as possible yet again where others i liked doing all the side objectives. And dont get me started on the damn ""optional"" objectives, One of the worst things when you had 4 other objectives to do while also trying to do another.Anyways,  Without making this too long.

When AC3 first came out I was so excited, partly because of me watching the trailers and Smosh's song parody. That Christmas, I got the game. This was the most excited I had been in a while for a game. My memories are faint, but I remember getting to Charles Lee's chase mission and found it unbeatable due to him falling through the floor at the start of the mission every single time. I had to wait an entire month for a patch to come out just so I could beat the level. That was the most disappointed I had ever been over a game in a franchise so close to my heart.

Fast forward to now where I'm replaying through every Assassin's Creed game. I was hesitant with AC3 and decided to finally play it. Is it as bad as I remember? Actually, it's not as bad as I remember at all.

In fact - it's WORSE.

The controls are at their worst yet, I don't understand how they managed to downgrade this much from Revelations. Connor is the most unlikeable and boring protagonist yet, the fact people like him more than Arno is baffling and makes no sense. His entire story is just wanting revenge, and being a dick to everyone he meets. I actually preferred the Templar more, as Haytham was such a fun and great character. But Connor is just overly serious and is just sooooo boring at all times and doesn't ease up at all.

Frontier sucks. It's the issue I have with most open worlds in most games, they're just lifeless and empty fields with trees and the occasional animal. To make matters worse, in the snow Frontier is a pain in the ass to get around, the ground becomes heavy snow except for the paths which make your journeys longer by going all over the damn place, then you have trees which are also slow to get around since they also divert all over the place.

The combat is pretty good, but I'm sick of enemies that can counter literally everything for no reason. It's annoying af having to constantly disarm an enemy just to kill them. Also for Unity I hated how enemies with guns were too OP, in this they're pathetic. If you are climbing, it is impossible to get shot unless you stand still. That one mission in Abstergo as Desmond, you can just move side-to-side in the elevator shaft at the entrance where enemies are unloading their pistols trying to hit you but they can't because they're pretty much stormtroopers. I got to the Charles Lee chase, he didn't fall through the floor at least, but instead he was knocking over his own men and they fell down like dominoes which made the chase laughable to complete.

This ship fights are actually really fun though, good thing AC4 is a pirate game. :^)

I liked the story of the game although some bugs and the frustrating optional goals with each mission made it quite hard to finish.

The graphics of the game are alright. Not the best, but I felt like they were better than the graphics of Assassin's Creed III: Liberation. Nothing special though.

The gameplay was good most of the time, although I wasn't a big fan of some missions. I also didn't like the optional goals which each mission had. Most of them were too hard to complete which either made me spend too much time on a single mission, or made me feel like I didn't really complete the mission.

Overall I would say Assassin's Creed III is not a bad game. I think it's worth playing if you are a fan of the series.

To be blunt. Back in 2012 I had a severe bias towards this entry mainly because I had just came hot off the heels of the Ezio trilogy, a trilogy that provided probably one of the most beloved characters in the series as well as set the standard for what we as fans wanted from the series. Now in 2021 I will say after replaying the game my original view has tempered even though I still hold some strong criticism for this games protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton or just Connor for all intensive purposes. And just to get that criticism out of the way I will say this. Yes I do feel like Connor from time to time is a rather boring character but in all honesty it makes sense due to upbringing and if anything he is more similar to Altair where he is far more noble or stoic and not the charismatic type like Ezio Auditore. His naiveté is something that I admire from a writing standpoint since it highlights the atrocities of colonial America and how someone that's native may have tried to rely on people like that. Of course I'll just leave the rest of the story up to the player because honestly Ubisoft set out to make a very mature Assassin's Creed game and this one is definitely a lot darker to a certain degree and I truly love that aspect. Now, on the meat and potatoes.

Assassin's Creed 3 is the fourth entry in the series taking place in colonial America and from a writing standpoint I admire this decision since that entire era was a powder keg of revolution and bloodshed. Instead of being in the fancy boots of Ezio you now take on the role of a new Assassin by the name of Ratonhnhaké:ton or just Connor for simplicity sake. Throughout the game you assist many political figures with the intention of saving your tribe and over throwing another Templar scheme which should be par for the course at this point in the series. However for the first time in the series you are no longer limited to the urban town settings of the previous installments, you are now able to freely explore and hunt in the woods of colonial America and honestly I'm not surprised that they added hunting to this game since originally this came out a month before Far Cry 3, another game developed by Ubisoft that reinvented its series with added hunting and exploration. 

Outside of feeling like a mohawk predator jumping from tree to tree, AC3 adds its own version of the villa from AC2 which is none other than the amazing homesteading feature. There is nothing more satisfying then slowly watching your plot of land develop over the course of the game since your near virgin cut of land slowly becomes a thriving community that opens numerous opportunities for making money, It also adds a lot of character shading for Connor which honestly I never noticed back in 2012. Also one of the other big features of this game that comes from the homestead is the incredible naval missions. The thought of commanding your own vessel of war on the high seas was a spectacle back in 2012 and since Assassin's Creed 4 has come out it may feel rather antiquated in comparison but either way it's still a blast to play through the short list of missions.

To top off this review I MUST give a disclaimer to potential buyers. This is the only way to play Assassin's Creed 3 now in 2021 and since it's a ""remaster"" there may be the typical Ubisoft charm of strange graphical anomalies but to me that's the least of my worries. My biggest worries is that you NEED Assassin's Creed Odyssey installed in order to get the activation code for this game to work. I don't know why that's such a big issue with this game but when you buy this make sure you buy Odyssey alongside it and if that turns you off then this may not be the game for you. But if you are looking to marathon this series you'll probably end up buying it anyway. But please keep this in mind when you purchase the game.

Firstly, the ""remaster"" really doesn't feel like one and while yes the environments do look good, certain character models look worse than the original which for some reason ubisoft thought that it was a good idea to not allow you to purchase the original version but none the less the remaster isn't great and if anything, this shouldn't have been the game to get a remaster, ac1 or ac 2 should have been the games to get the remaster because the original version of this game still held up and some might say even looked better than the remaster. Also I am not a huge fan of the gameplay, The combat is great with cool tactics and weapons to use, from chain killing to great double kill animations, the combat is an acceptation to the bad gameplay but the parkour and stealth isn't. The stealth in this game is really bad and guards will spot you in a fraction of a second. It is overly difficult and I found it easier by just rushing in and felt like stealth wasn't viable. And the parkour feels really janky and Connor will constantly not go where you want him to and it became frustrating near the end. The animations are great and might trick you into thinking the parkour is fluid but it really doesn't feel that way. Does this game deserve the hate? No but it defiantly isn't the greatest ac game. If you are going to get this game, get in on a sale because 50cad is way too much for this game at least in my opinion.

It's second time I played this game, not because I liked it so much but I got it free with Season Pass from Odyssey. But I am so glad I played it again, first time I finished original game. The graphics are much better in Remastered. You can notice a lot of bugs in this game, I don't know why are more bugs in this version than the original, at some point it was annoying. At the end of the day it's a good game.

[b]The Tyranny of King Washington DLC[/b]
Very good DLC, first time playing it, it was a good experience. Parallel world of the main game and story. Some cool new skills are introduced into the game.

[b]Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered[/b]
First of all, playing it on PC it's a bad experience for some players, I experienced some nasty stuff about resolution or FPS drops, but you can fix it. I started with low expectations regarding this game, and at the beginning of the game I really felt it as I expected (""I just want to finish it""), but after some hours I enjoyed very much and I was very wrong about the game. Originally released for PlayStation Vita only it's not a suprise you can have problems on PC. I liked the story, the gameplay (fighting, parkour). This protagonist is more charismatic than Connor from AC III. Very good!

In the end, all three : 8.5/10

I played Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Assassin's Creed Revelations, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and Assassins Creed Odyssey.  I enjoyed every one of them, except for moments in the Ezio series (ACII, Brotherhood, and Revelations), and my favorite part was what I call ""easy stealth"".  While it is not always ""easy"", it is a lot less complicated than games such Hitman and Dishonored.  The problem with the game is that ""easy stealth"" is either really hard, or impossible most of the time.  Not only are the enemy placements terrible, and the pathfinding when getting back to their places imprecise at best, making it impossible to double assassinations, the game bugs out half the time when you are climbing, again making it hard to do stealth.  The enemy's also like to detect you inconsistently and their noise detection is completely over-powered.  The open-combat is fine, similar to black flag, if a little bit harder.  The naval  combat is fine, but is done better in black flag.  Basically, this entire game is basically a worse black flag with horrible stealth (Stealth is the reason I buy these games).  I got this game with Assassins Creed Odyssey, and it is the only reason you should get it.
Edit: As I played on I unlocked more recruits, which give you special powers such as covert escort, and that made the game infinitely more playable.  Maybe my standards lowered, maybe I got better, but I started not hating the game as much.  My negative review does not change, but my overall rating does to 6/10.

911400,100391331,76561198321647999,0,34,6746,0,6275,1655633442,"Third in the title after the conclusion of the Ezio trilogy the game starts by following a man who later turns out not to be what we expect him to be and continues the story following his son Ratonhnhaké:ton (Connor). We quickly see him grow, under the guide of an Assassin mentor Achilles, into a man who eventually becomes an Assassin himself with strong principles and stronger determination to make things right, fighting to protect his people against the rising number of those encroaching on their lands and the approaching Revolutionary war around the area. Throughout the game Connor's stoic demeanor slowly succumbs to more emotional state when time and time again he's pushed into realization that the people he chose to help end up being no worse than the ones he's been fighting against. His personality perfectly conveys his internal struggle to fight against the oppressors and at the same time wisdom, passion and kindness to help those being oppressed themselves. Helping the Americans succeed in their independence however, he fails in what he set out to do, to keeps his people and land safe from the expanding colonists' territory and in the end losing a lot more than he had in the beginning both from his own perspective and that of his people. He's physically the strongest Assassin we've played with, with equally strong heart to do what's right, incorruptible and kind, showing restraint and wisdom when he's given none.

A new addition to the game is helping people in need and giving them a place to call home, in tern expanding the homestead and profiting from their wares. Although some getting used to, the convoy system of trading is simple to use and allows some items available to buy in stores to be crafted instead. Naval battles also play a role in both expanding the story and serving as DLC expansion, setting the naval stage for the following game in the franchise to take over.

The Tyranny of King Washington DLC shows us what would've happened if George Washington never found a confidant in Connor to come to at his hour of need. It made him realize how dangerous the Piece of Eden is to corrupt a man by showing him how different his life could be if he were to remain in longer possession of it. At the end he's still strong enough in that moment to recognize the descending path the Apple has been making him go down on and has more than enough trust in Connor to do what's right with it.
The DLC also introduces us to Connor's animal powers which are a joy to use, especially with an overwhelming amount of enemies around the cities and the Frontier, although having a strong restriction on how many times they can be used is sometimes to the detriment of the game itself. Where Eagle flight uses little health the Bear takes off a lot of it, and with the amount of enemies that spawn often times out of thin air it can harm more than help if used more than twice. The Wolf Cloak is most useful going after collectibles and sneaking around said large number of enemies, but in a densely crowded area often times fails even if successfully avoding people because the rats also contribute to physical contact and the Cloak inevitably fails if not quick enough to make notice and avoid the ""tiny citizens"". Overall all three powers are fun to use and add a new way of moving around the overrun cities and taking down enemies.

The remastered version also comes with Liberation, taking place around the same time ACIII does, but following an already established female Assassin Aveline who works to free the slaves and end corruption in her city of New Orleans. The first thing players will notice is the nostalgic controls most associated with earlier games in the franchise, and for whoever played them it will take no effort in getting back to the old ways. There are three ways to move around the city which are unique to Aveline - The Lady, The Slave & The Assassin, all contributing to different ways of getting certain collectibles, most of them exclusive to each persona, in both the city and the Bayou, revealed by exploring the areas as well as doing missions scattered around without the need to buy maps. The posters and bribes make a return as well adding to the nostalgia and the introduction of the new weapon, the Parasol Gun, removes the bounty just as quietly and efficiently. Money is earned through ship trades and, although it takes a while to start earning larger sums of money, once more trade routes are opened it becomes a lot easier. Although made for a handheld console the game holds its own, retaining the charm, combat, story elements, movement, weapons etc. of the main games in the franchise. The difference in how it's presented though, is attributed to the fact the game is Abstergo's released product, making it essentially a game within an Assassin's Creed Universe, which is also why it has two endings. The story of Aveline is far from finished and with the small connection it made to Connor it would be amiss not to get a main game featuring her as the protagonist.

Both games and their DLCs packaged in HD release offer a lot of hours of gameplay to enjoy two different parts of the American coastline in the 18th century, with both old and new mechanics. After the Ezio trilogy Connor's story is a fresh new start to the ever expending Assassin Universe that hopefully doesn't end for a long time to come.",1633204662,1633243439,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I supposed had I started with the early games I would have more investment in the Assassins v. Templar theme, and the whole Apple of Eden quest. As it stands, in AC III on, I feel like it is a distraction from the core game. 
AC III inexplicably opens with some mysterious ""Desmond"" modern character, who reminds me of Ben Stiller, attempting to play an exaggerated dumb jock. He's standing in front of a cave, so you walk into the cave, turn left ... Cinematic ... Okay, no big deal, now I'm in the cave, oh, this is teaching me to run and climb. Okay, I get it ... Cinematic.  Okay, now we're playing the game! I'm Hatham Kenway, son of Pirate Edward Kenway from Black Flag! Cool!  I'm in pre-revolutionary Boston! Cool!  I meet Ben Franklin! Cool!  This is pretty cool!  I get to ride a horse around (why don't people get out of the way of a sprinting horse?) I meet a beautiful native American woman and ... have sex?  Wow! Great game!  Wait ... what?  Back to Desmond ... still in a cave ... doesn't get along with his dad ... well, yeah, they're both jerks I don't identify with ... Now I'm a kid?  Playing hide-and-seek with other kids?  What happened to Kenway?  What game is this? NOW you roll the credits!?  I've been playing for hours over several days (with breaks) and we're just NOW getting to the ACTUAL game!?  Who wrote this mess!?  Who thought this was a good way to structure a game?  Who thought ""Connor"" sounded Spanish!?  LOL!
Once the game gets going, it is entertaining. Connor's tomahawk is a lot of fun. The controls are a little cumbersome on PC. Not sure what its like on console, but glad they figured out better ways by AC4 and AC5.  The game is MUCH longer than Black Flag or Rogue.  Lots more to do, but unfortunately, most of it entails riding around on horseback, dodging red coats, who are constantly just annoying enough to make your tasks a challenge, but not tough enough to be challenging (if that makes sense). 
Still, a fun game, not too fiddlely with skills and other complicated mechanics that later games took on. Much more to see and do than Black Flag and Rogue. Enjoyed re-living the setup to the Revolution War.  Time for a replay to see what I missed the fist time.",1632770761,1632770761,True,3,0,0.548254609107971191,0,True,False,False

Story - Extremely boring and single threaded. It is the most boiler plate revenge story ever with the most unlikable characters ever. Basically the story follows a kid who has his home destroyed and he proceeds to seek revenge, during this, the american revolution is also playing out in the background. There are no twists, no turns, just a mad Main character and people dying. The game low key gives Conner the credit for a bunch of the key moments in the revolution despite his complete lack of interest in the war. Like he literally goes on a walk, looking for a dude and gets involved in the Boston tea party. He goes for groceries and he's involved in the Boston massacre. I probably shouldnt be annoyed by this but the revolution was driven entirely by passion, but the character they chose to credit with the achievements and victories of the revolution is also complaining the whole time for having to participate.  I hate Conner he's always mad, at everyone, for everything, all the time even at his allies....... because his mother died in a fire...... His character can be summarized as morally indignant native american - which yeah okay that can be a powerful character trait, but if that's all he has going on then he's going to be supremely boring. In the ezio trilogy we had the interplay of the personal life and the ideology which drove the assassins. As far as I can tell Conner doesnt care at all about the assassin vs templar conflict, and instead kills dozens of people for no other reason than a personal vendetta. There's a lot more about the story that I could talk about but ultimately it just boils down to the story being boring so lets move on.

Gameplay - what have they done? They ruined it. Oh my god its awful. So they removed the divide between sprinting and freerunning so anytime you try to sprint, if you're close to a freerunning snap point you might jump to it, meaning a borderline successful escape attempt can be cut short by conner jumping on to a fence you run past. They game also tries to assume where your trying to drive your character which means that sometimes you might jump in completely the wrong direction if theres a snap point the game thinks your aiming for, it just feels like you're not even in control sometimes and that you just have to press forward and hope it goes right. They also updated the climbing points and integrate them better with the environment, however since the game also largely takes place in the wilderness the points you can climb and the points you cant climb become much harder to see and differentiate between. Anyone who has 100%'ed the pegleg trinkets (and didnt use a guide) understands this extremely well. Guns have effectively been ruined. I'm not sure if theres an in story explanation as to why instead of using ezio's op semi-auto wrist pistol instead of this flint lock pos but we need to go back, the bow is slightly better but I never had arrows, I'm not really sure where to get them tbh. Lockon is effectively gone. Instead of a proper hard lock on the game decide who it wants you to attack at random, you can switch targets but it'll switch it for you..... you know just to completely **** you over. Swords and Axes felt pretty useless, I didnt feel like I could really fight until I got my hands on a heavy club, and I just used that for the rest of the game. Combat is cancerous now, you cant use anything but your melee weapons now, the game actively blocks you from swapping to certain items during combat, you can get 1-3 (depending on the gun) shots off during a fight but then the gun is effectively useless. Countering is inconsistent and you have to memorize what type of counter works on what types of enemies now as ""guard break"" seems to be completely useless. The frontiersman system replaced the shop buying system from the old games. It was pretty interesting and could have been great but the UI was really hard to understand and you get the last craftsmen near the end of the game so by the time you're able to fully utilize it you're almost completely done with the game. Mission objectives and desynchronization  are now more annoying than ever. Missions often come with sets of optional objectives depriving you of your own agency and creativity than ever before, whats worse is the game often does not display the optional objectives until you have failed one at which point the game pops up a nice red x just to let you know how much of a failure you are, which really ruins the hype if youre on a roll killing guards or blowing up barrels or w/e.  Desych (aka mission failure or death) also annoyed me. checkpoints were poorly placed often tiomes failing a missing near the end would have you restart from the beginning several checkpoints ago, and on missions with hidden failure conditions, such as dont walk next to a certain tree, dont climb anything or go  through a ""building escape"" can be quite annoying. For example in one mission you have to assassinate some enemies on horses, but if you kill any of the other enemies on the road you instantly fail and are taken back pre cutscene no where did it say ""dont kill anyone"". In addition not skinning animals gives you a desynch warning  - this probably annoyed me the most because theres a certain area near the first frontiersman mission objectives where there is an elk spawn a bobcat spawn and a wolf spawn which leaves you in an endless loop of quick time events as you kill hundreds of wild animals because as soon as you kill one of them the next one attacks and in the mean time the others respawned. I think I killed about 40 animals before I could edge my self out of the triangle murder and then as I left my screen started flickering like crazy because ""Conner skinned all the animals he killed"" - Look devs, you almost entirely removed the need for money in this game and then added an abusive amount of aggressive wild animals to the game, I am NOT wasting my time to skin every friggin wolf that wants to cause me problems...... Ship combat was pretty cool I guess.

Overall this seems like a direct downgrade from the prior games, combat is worse, movement is worse, the story is boring and the frontiersman system while nifty was too hard to use and not fully functional until a point in the game where it was no longer valuable.  Of the assassins creed games I've played so far (1,2,brotherhood, rev, 3, origins, odyssey) I rate this one the lowest. Unless you're playing this one to complete the Desmond story, I'd recommend you skip it entirely.",1632714168,1632714168,False,32,5,0.562369942665100098,0,True,False,False

From this review on I won’t be mentioning any of the stories anymore. Because a) I can’t put them into words well enough to make sense and b) because I myself have a hard time keeping up with the overarching story(lines).
What I can tell though is that this story starts of really, really slow.
So onwards to the gameplay we go:

Instead of an entirely new game that would justify this being the third in the series we basically got the same old Assassin’s Creed without any real innovation. Well, that’s a lie. There’s one part that’s completely new to the entire series and that’s naval combat which I will discuss in a minute.
For now know that you can climb more obstacles and that you can dual-wield weapons. Combat in general has been revamped making it a little more challenging, but nothing a veteran wouldn’t be able to handle.
A lot of the changes have been made under the hood and therefore they’re not really obvious to the average gamer. That’s why I and so many others find it so underwhelming. And that’s a shame.
As I mentioned the naval combat is new to the series and you can steer (and upgrade) your own ship during some of the missions. Naval combat is just like it says; ‘combat’, so there isn’t any exploring. It’s just you, the enemies and the ocean (or: rogue waves). It works very well and it looks great in motion. In fact, it works so well that Black Flag is largely based around this gameplay mechanic. But that’s something for another time.

When this game was first released it was gorgeous to look at. Beautiful snowy environments and a cold climate that would make you shiver in your own warm and comfortable home; it was perfect. And even after the snow had melted it was amazing. Apart from a few too many houses being copy-pasted the variety in environments was also incredible. The series never had any issues with well animated characters and this one was no different.
Same goes for all of the sounds, music and voice actors; all of them are of incredibly high quality.
Audio-visually it was a stunner and it was proven to be a true sequel.
I casually go over these things in all of my reviews, but I mean them. And this is because of two reasons: I want to talk more about the game itself (but I do want to mention it) and for the older games I usually can’t completely remember all of the finer details.
(With the HD update the game still looks mighty pretty by the way)

I must admit there’s still enough to enjoy Assassin’s Creed III, but for many fans - including me - it wasn’t the sequel we were hoping for. With new graphics new and more varied gameplay mechanics were also expected, but it just felt like playing any previous Assassin’s Creed game in reality. Just with some added detail. The bugs and glitches also didn’t contribute to a good experience. A real shame. Fortunately Ubisoft listened and with the arrival of Black Flag they would once again redeem themselves. Until next time!

Whoever oversaw this remaster was either paid-off or blind. The graphics are just as dated as when it released almost a decade ago, and you'll see it when you play it.

This allows me to confidently say that Assassin's Creed 3 is the worst in the franchise and should be skipped. The only reason to play it is for Desmond's story.

    [*]Explore the 1700's American era of Boston & New York during the integral revolutionary war period
    [*]Contains a small epilogue to Desmond's story
    [*]The new naval combat system is very simple and satisfying to operate, full sync requirements are a challenge but are not unreasonable (tank mission intensifies)
    [*]Accounting book system is a versatile trading/income management tool that allows for multiple revenue streams at a fast rate; although appearing more complex than previous passive income systems in AC titles, the accounting book is a useful tool to maximize the productivity of your homestead
    [*]Collectibles are much more reasonable and rewarding, no longer collect 100 of every objective, instead chests now contain crafting recipes & other collectibles are less scattered and easier to obtain
    [*]Tyranny DLC is an interesting ""what-if"" scenario that introduces ridiculous overpowered but enjoyable abiltiies
    [*]Contains ""Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered"", play as Aveline another assassin who is operating in New Orleans around the same timeline; her adventure is a good added 20hrs at most (To access Liberation you must launch it from your steam library through AC3's ""Play"" button, players will be prompted to select which game to play)

First, the keyboard controls are highly resistant to customization.  You go into the Controls section and try to arrange the movement buttons to how you want them...and the buttons you want to change are the same buttons that shift the highlighted button in the list to the next button!  So if you want to change 'Move Forward' from 'W' to 'E'...such as if you, like me, have larger hands that don't fit well into W,A,S,D movement keys...you highlight 'Move Forward', click 'Enter', and then hit 'E', right?  No.  Hitting 'E' shifts the list of controls up by a line.

I had to work my way around the keyboard several times before it would finally accept the basic movement configuration that fits my hand.

Then there's the plot.  They suddenly introduce Desmond's father as though he's been with you since the end of the last game.  But he did not show up at the end of AC 2, so why is he here all of a sudden?!?

Next is the voice acting.  This is some seriously third-rate acting.  Sorry to the V.O. folks who did the work.  I imagine they could have done better, but were given bad direction.   Terrible.

But the worst part is the graphics.  I've got a top-of-the-line Alienware gaming PC and I can't turn my vision by more than ten degrees without the universe suddenly lurching thirty degrees farther than I wanted to look.  And when I try to look back the other way, it happens again!  I tried adjusting the graphics both up and down and it still does it.  

I am at this point cutting my losses and quitting the game.  And the entire AC series.

This is a review for someone who is jumping straight into the game such as I did.  The game was not fully as I expected.  I picked this specific one because it was a time period that was interesting to me, and it had its ups and downs.  It firstly looks beautiful, which is part of the reason that it drew me in.  But the problem, is that this game feels too open.  I never thought I would be complaining about something giving you lots of options, but you almost never feel motivated to go outside the main quest.  You have no incentive to buy better weapons, catch the book pages, and hunting quests.  There is just so much busy work that it doesn't feel meaningful.  It wasn't totally what I had expected, but it just delivered and took away some parts in different places.  I feel that if the map would have been smaller, it would be more meaningful and it would nail the revolution theme even better.  If you are buying this game, you are buying for the story and the game play, because to me, the replay value is non existent to me.  Now, the story inside the actual animus has to be one of the best stories in a game.  I love how it stars a Native seeking to essentially kill his father, who aligns with people who want to burn down their town.  As to outside of the animus, I am basically clueless as to what is happening, so maybe as to not start with this installment if you are interested in the lore about Desmond, the actual character who relives memories.  I have no clue about who Judo is and what Desmond was doing in Brazil, but I just went with the flow.  And I still don't fully understand why the Assassins and Templars don't agree, but again, I just went with it. It is like a story inside a story, and the one in the animus really drew me in.  Achilles has such a humanized personality and feel like a real character, along with his side kick or main character, Connor or as I would try to say his real name Ratonhnhaké:ton.  I love this character as he embraces a brave and persistent soul.  And as soon as he threw the axe into the column, I knew that I was in for a ride.  The game play is par.  Nothing to special, but the combat is significantly harder only because of the wacky controls.  Not in the key binds, but in the way he moves.  I could count hundreds of times where I have climbed or fell of something and many times it had cost me a life.  But otherwise, very average and enjoyable game play.  This game tends to have tons of glitches.  Sometimes I would load in and it would just not let you back in, which was the most common, but still rare enough as to not affect the experience.  Next, sometimes I would load in, and only certain parts of the textures were there.  Half would be see through, and half would be there.  But other than these gripes, this game is definitely worth playing for the story.  And once you pulled out the axe out of the column, is was one of the coolest symbols in game.",1629771338,1629771338,True,10,0,0.582288622856140137,0,True,False,False

To begin, at least with the version I have, it includes Assassin's Creed 3, Assassin's Creed Liberation, and the King Washington DLC. I believe I got this from one of the Odyssey editions. These games take place during the French and Indian War as well as the American Revolution. Each game and the DLC took about 10-12 hours.

Even though its remastered Assassin's Creed 3 itself still could use some work. The first 5 sequences feel like a extremely drawn out exposition and tutorial. For those used to the fast travel of more recent titles it mainly serves to get you to different parts of the world and is lacking inside these parts. This is most obvious on the frontier where you can access a horse that sometimes isn't worth the hassle. Some naval combat is introduced which is a nice feature. Modern day is interesting with the story following Desmond Miles.

AC: Liberation
I personally enjoyed Liberation more than AC:3. The pacing and dialogue were both smooth if a little quick at first. Naval combat was not present in the game, however it did introduce the ""persona"" system which offered a unique perspective to stealth and infiltration. There was very little content related to modern day, which mainly took the form of extra cut scenes. The main issue I ran into was occasional lag and frame drops.

In conclusion, AC 3 Remastered has a decent story and fair gameplay. I would recommend it for those interested in continuing the Assassin's Creed series especially if it can be bought at a discount.",1629424695,1629424695,True,3,0,0.551940739154815674,0,True,False,False

I played the remastered version pretty much straight after playing the original, so it gives me the ability to really compare. Overall, it seems like such a missed opportunity to change some of the shortcomings of the original game.

Sure, the graphics have been greatly improved (i.e. water and HDR lighting), but that is tempered with the graphical quality on the character faces being a bit 'off'. The bugs are still there from the original version, which is quite frankly quite annoying.

Overall, the game isn't as 'fun' as the previous instalments (as some of the optional objectives are just tedious), although the enhanced dynamics in fighting and movement do enhance the realism and immersion.

[b]ACIII: Liberation[/b]
Certainly not the best in the series, but still reasonably enjoyable. The story is bit formulaic, but as it is built on the ACIII engine, the fighting and character movements are dynamic and fluid, which keeps things engaging.

The graphics are pretty good. But not all of them. The buildings, the Frontier, clothing looks absolutely Nice.
Graphics of characters don't fare that well. I mean they're good enough though... close shots in game shows remaster errors in them. Sometimes eyes have vein too much. Lipsyncing is sometimes is a issue.
Hunting and crafting is interesting. Homestead Accounting book can be problem at first, spend some time knowing it and You will have a steady source of money. 
Story is mature. Not one-sided Good Vs. Evil. Connor is not a much of fun as a protagnist to say the least.
Witnessing events of American Revolution is very exciting.

AC3 seems polarizing whenever I see discussions about the story, some people think Connor is whiny and trying too hard to be a badass to the point where he mostly comes across as a cunt. Others find Connor to be stoic and harsh, slow to trust most people as a result of his childhood trauma.  Personally, I found that the game crashed every ten minutes, and Connor to be an interesting character with engaging relationships with the rest of the cast, after I stopped comparing him to Ezio. It’s not that as a character Ezio is much better than Connor, it’s just that Connor isn’t allowed to have as much fun as Ezio is, and that adds to the atmosphere for a slight detraction in dialogue. As for the rest of the cast, their pretty top notch. Some people hate the opening bate and switch, I found it refreshing and a great way to SHOW what the villains are about, instead of just being TOLD, in a game that crashes every ten minutes. As for the villains themselves, Haytham is enjoyable and his relationship with Connor leads to a fair amount of interesting exchange, most of it is just you’re an idiot, but he brought in a unique perspective in a game that crashes every ten minutes. Lee on the other hand is a well-built villain, there’s nothing overwhelming powerful about him, you never tread your encounters, but having witnessed everything he’s done, and everything Connor has done to find him, it’s fun when the two meet, and the final kill scene is the best death the series as ever put out, and it earned a lot of points for me. General story events are ripped straight from the American revolution in a disjointed way, making most things you do feel disconnected and as a result personal invest suffers. It’s worth noting that having a vague understanding of the American revolution timeline, add some entertainment as you can now go, “hey I know that guy,” or “hey, I know what’s gonna happen kinda,” or, “hey, the game crashed again.” Modern day is back again, having been built up in AC1, 2, and Brotherhood, and then immediately dropped in Revelations, only to return here where it crashes every ten minutes. Modern day takes a lot more relevance in the story, before it was mostly just adding to the depth of the overall story, in AC3 it was used to dump dialogue and do some neat parkour. You only visit a few places, and for a small amount of time, but actually playing in the modern day this time around was so damn refreshing. Sure, the tension between Desmond and his father was so wooden I was worried that I’d get a splinter, and the whole interrupting game moments got annoying, I’d still say it’s the best and most engaging modern day we have… gameplay wise. 

AC1 brought in the idea of counter killing, and the AC2 trilogy brought in chain killing, what then does AC3 do, guns I guess and crashing every ten minutes. However, it’s the same case here as it was with revelations, what ain’t broke don’t need fixing. Chain killing is still fun, now with newer and more creative animations, and with how often the game throws large waves of enemies at you, you’ll find the combat in AC3 to be fluid, addictive, and mindlessly easy. It turns out being able to insta kill most enemies makes encounters simple. Provided the game hasn’t crashed, the devs solution to the lack of difficulty is to occasionally add in some two or three shot enemies, which helps more than you think but less than they should. Another quirk of AC3 is opponent's attacks not always being properly telegraphed, and while this can be chalked up to a glitch, I’m going to call it a feature. Mainly because it makes fights more engaging by forcing you to pay attention to everyone and their behavior, and not just little red triangles, and if the game has crashed.

A criticism of the new Assassin’s Creed games is the lack of depth in the parkour, it’s not that the previous games were particularly great at parkour, but it required a little more than just holding W. While each building is no longer a mini puzzle on how to climb it, the parkour system now has a sense of flow that was near impossible to achieve in previous games. The puzzle nature however, is not completely eliminated unlike the crashing. Viewpoints and parkour heavy missions demand some thought into where you place yourself in order to complete the objective. Not to mention traversing in the trees, which while heavily underutilized, requires a good amount of attention without damaging the pace. I prefer the old parkour system, it was very stop and go but it made climbing each building interesting, but I can see why others prefer this system. 
If me mentioning that the game crashes every ten minutes has somewhat annoyed you, then imagine playing the game. Are there other bugs in the game, yes, do they matter, typically not. Every now and then a guard will spot you when they have no right to, but generally all that does is limit full synchronization, which if you’re going for then expect some bullshit regardless of developer intent. Admittedly the game does gain better stability as you progress, although it’s still not worth it unless you have a good SSD, and CPU to reload the game fast. No, it isn’t a testament to this game greatness that I played through it even though it crashed more than most crypto currencies, but a testament to the auto save feature, since I rarely lost more than a minute’s worth of progress. Don’t get me wrong, it was still frustrating beyond belief, but I’ve seen worse.

Lastly, it’s worth mentioning that this game in its entirety can be bought either separately or in the gold edition of Odyssey. I highly recommend the latter. On sale, this game is less than 10 CAD, as opposed to 25 when purchased alone. And while I had a tremendous issue in the game’s stability, you probably won’t, since I don’t see it as too widespread a problem. 

Tyranny of Kings is also included here, and wow is it… apart of the game. The whole concept of alternate history is oozing with potential and AC3 did it’s best to tell an amazing story in the most boring possible way. Lazy storing telling aside, the gameplay is shockingly not just more of what the none DLC has to offer, we have three new abilities. There’s the coyote ability which grants invisibility and is so much fun in stealth situations, an eagle ability which allows you to basically teleport around the map, and a bear ability which sure exists! I cannot recommend the Tyranny of Kings enough but do make sure to beat the regular game first, what little the story does have to offer is only in Connor vaguely knowing he’s in an alternate reality, and it’s meaningless unless you’ve played through the campaign.

But the real kick in the shin, is that they de-listed the original, most stable, version of the game from steam. You can no longer purchase, and play the original AC3.

This game is a clear cash grab, and I despise it. But unfortunately this is currently the only way to play AC3 (on steam). If you want to play AC3, it's likely you will have to bite the bullet and play this heaping pile of horse shite, or pull out your xbox360/PS3 and play it there.

Assassin's Creed III was a good game. Despite having lows, it was fairly solid. 
Assassin's Creed III Remastered, however, shits on the legacy of the original. 

Being the only version of ACIII on on PC, and being the only remaster of any of the first trilogy games, this should be the definitive experience. Nope. Despite being ""Remastered"", the only things improved were lighting and textures. 2019 models and textures paired with original 2012... everything else makes characters and the world look out of place. Only remastering visuals also means the gameplay experience is the same. The same large amount (if not more) bugs still exist and have not been paid attention to, one of the worst being enemies seeing you through walls. Yeah, so much for stealth. And to finish off, pricing. Since Ubisoft markets this game as ""Remastered"", they feel you should shove that up your ass and pay them $40. Costing twice as much as the previous non-""remastered"" game is unacceptable. 

TL;DR: Despite being originally good, ACIII adds numerous technical and gameplay bugs that make the game unenjoyable 
            and almost unplayable.

ACIII is not as bad a game as you might have heard.

First of all, the Remastered really only has better graphics than the original, so don't buy this if you've played it.

I personally don't think that this game is a bad game or a bad Assassin's Creed. The story is good and has a few very interesting turns - it also presents the finale to the first trilogy of games [spoiler]because it's the last game with Desmond[/spoiler] and makes that enjoyable and worthy of the previous games.
You are guided through two very important cities of the American Revolution: New York City and Boston, as well as the uncolonised lands in the west and - of course - a place for you, the player, to build up from scratch. Unfortunately, Ubisoft has reworked the viewpoint-system and these now don't reveal the entire map anymore - instead, you have to run through the dark areas now if you want the entire thing revealed because the big circles around the points leave quite a few spaces. This was probably meant to encourage exploration, but quickly deteriorates into senseless running around, only staring at the map.
The story introduces multiple important characters of the American Revolution and makes Connor participate in or lead many events you might have heard of. Next to that, he tries to get revenge on a Templar who had burned his home village in his youth - yes, a typical revenge story, but it's very well done and atmospheric.

The controls have definitely improved from the ACIIs. Running and climbing feel a lot more accurate and good. Additionally, a ship has been introduced, which allows for some exciting naval missions where you fight pirates or Brits or just good ol' Templars. This doesn't feel as good as in Black Flag or Odyssey, but good enough for the first AC where this was tried out.

So, the base game is good, but there is a DLC: The Tyranny of King Washington. This play in an alternate universe where George Washington got a hold of an Apple of Eden and instituted a monarchy in the United States and now has plans for world domination - and Connor naturally has to stop that from happening. They actually introduced new mechanics here: abilities you gain from psychedelic drugs which make you imagine animals. These are quite cool and allow you to become invisible, fly or stamp your feet at the ground. The downside is that they cost health which devolves a lot of fights into ""ability, ability, run around until health has recovered, ability""-repetitions; the game spawns too many enemies to allow for normal combat. And there comes a big critique: because you have these abilities, it is assumed that you want to use them all the time and so you don't actually get a choice here, the game just spawns endless enemies. Even if you're not in combat. I'm not making things up here: sometimes when running (or flying) to the next mission and closing in on it suddenly a group of enemies was spawned out of nowhere. And because within a certain range all soldiers are automatically drawn into fights, this prevented me from beginning the mission for quite some time. Additionally, some climbing mechanics somehow are made worse in the DLC. I don't know how or why, they just feel more cluncy than in the base game.
Other than that, the DLC isn't too bad. It isn't as good as the base game but good enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And now to AC Liberation.

Mechanically, both games are quite similar, although one aspect was added here: the ability to switch costumes. This allows the player to become a lady, assassin or slave depending on what's necessary or what is needed for the mission. All costumes have their up- and downsides, the lady for example can't climb while the assassin will always be investigated by guards on sight. This feature sounds fun, but quickly becomes annoying because missions sometimes switch costumes automatically and running around the world as a lady is just not enjoyable.

The game is set in New Orleans, the surrounding swamps and Chichén Itzá. The world feels a lot smaller than in other ACs, but that may be due to the fact that the game was originally developed for the PS Vita, which arguably isn't as powerful as a PC or modern console.

This leads to another weakness of the game: The story. Theoretically, it's aspects allow for a good adventure, but because the Vita is a portable console, the story isn't exactly contiguous. Oftentimes, it feels like aspects or scenes are missing: most relationships and some strings of the storyline don't make a whole lot of sense and might require some reading-up. This goes so far that I didn't understand how the ending came to be and how things got the way they are presented. Dialogues also oftentimes seem too short for the content they are supposed to deliver.
But to get into details: The game follows the young assassin Avelin de Grandpré in her quest to... free slaves? Work for the brotherhood? Help smugglers? The game can't really decide between the three and just switches between them, making the character Avelin less sharp and understandable - although it becomes clear that she isn't too certain on who she is and her inner conflict is built up throughout the game, culminating in an epic finale.. Connor also gets a mission, but there he feels weirdly superficial and unlike the master-assassin you got to know when playing ACIII.

All in all, I have mixed feelings on this game. On the one hand, the story presents the player a very interesting Coming-of-Age adventure and - as always - the world is very interesting and exciting to explore. On the other hand, the continuity is kind of missing and the costume-mechanic doesn't feel entirely finished.
I would only recommend playing this if you either picked up the Remastered anyways or if you want to play through the entire series. Otherwise it just isn't as enjoyable as other Assassin's Creeds.",1625786054,1625832883,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

[h1] PROS [/h1]

  1. I don't very much like the setting of the revolutionary war, but I have to give credit for the attention to detail and how living and breathing the world felt. Not to mention the lighting and environments in the frontier were actually really pretty for how old the game is. 
  2. Combat movements/attacks/finishers felt much more fluid, however this resulted in issues with responsiveness.
  3. Connor's relationship with Haytham was super cool and interesting to see.
  4. Awesome new environments, a lot less ""don't be detected"" missions than other games. 

[h1] CONS [/h1] 

  1. Once again, I was not at all incentivized to complete any side missions whatsoever. I never bought an item from the shop, I never completed side quests, I never invested, I never did anything that weren't the main missions because I wasn't rewarded and it wasn't fun.
  2. Because of the fluidity of the attack movements, controls themselves take a massive blow. Counters would only work about half the time despite being pressed at about the same time, this could be my fault but I didn't have this issue in the other games. 
  3. Counter and then clicking attack doesn't attack. Very cool!
  4. The game sometimes doesn't tell you what you need to do or where you need to go during certain missions, so you have your objective but no idea how to get there. I failed the final chase scene several times because I had no idea what the game wanted me to do. 
  5. Connor is not that likeable in my opinion. I like how his speech is very proper, and its cool how we have conversations in his native language, but his demeanor doesn't sit with me the same way that Ezio and Altair did. 
  6. So many bugs, an exterminator couldnt take care of them. More than the other four games combined. 
  7. At least for keyboard and mouse, the controls were drastically changed, AGAIN. I hate hate hate hate hate how the games change the controls for every single game, and I understand it may be to introduce new features, but this one was so unbearably foreign to me that I had to dedicate time to learning the controls. 
  8. Desmond's face was changed from the last game, and even further from the games before that. Why??
 
[h1] VERDICT [/h1]

  Overall, it was a very cool game and I was glad I played it as the next game in the Assassins Creed franchise, however I found myself sprinting towards the next mission to finish the game as fast as possible. I was so hopelessly bored with side missions, and at some points the main story stagnated, so I got really frustrated and ended up playing Halo. 
  Ultimately, I recommend playing the game for anyone coming from the previous games in the franchise. If you haven't played those, I could not recommend this game simply because you really won't care about what's going on behind the scenes. That was why I played the game in the first place.

However AC3 is definitely the worst AC I have ever played. 
Of course it is still a playable AAA a title with established game mechanics and if it was an indie studio it would be double thumb-up but for UBISoft in comparison to other AC title, it is a clear thumb down.
As someone else commented: buy it if you think you have to complete all titles of AC but skip it if you are looking for story and gameplay.

I am playing the remastered version and cannot compare to the original release.
- For a remastered version and how much effort they put into graphical update, some models and textures look terrible. Other things look very nice, but they did already in the initial release.
- Most bugs I have ever seen in all other my AC games combined. Backwards running people, missing quests NPCs, enemy guards despawning when moving close, spawning when going away and coming to aid other NPCs in fight, ....
- The worst of all, bad parkour mechanics probably made even worse by map design. Running does not feel satisfying by taking obsticles but combersome to avoid being stopped by obsticles because Desmond likes to jump on everything while he should just run, makes heroic jump from a stair or doesn't jump at all, ... most of it is maybe typical behavior seen in other AC games but here it feels so much annoying.
And simply things that don't work. Like some specific jumps I could not manage and had to search in internet to find the solution on how to do the jump exactly and still had to try several times (this is supposed to be a one button spam jump game not a rogue like plattformer).
- Fights... swarmed by NPCs plus bad fight mechanics like 3 seconds assasination animation during which Desmond can be attacked and interupted and NPC that always attack after the 1 second. Weird parry/counter mechanics, which I enjoyed in other AC titles, are here just frustrating. 
Some quicktime events are broken I would say... eg the mission encounter with three wolves, when the first wolf always failed... always. Although I fought six bears in a row without a single fail.
- Map design... feels boring. I can see they put some efforts to make it look living places ... but they somehow didn't manage. It still looks empty, with dozen of people running around. 
The wilds ... looks interesing but adds nothing to the game, is time consuming to travel has only boring quests, silly, full of cliche
- Quests... beside the main quest line, are either simple as taking a lolli from a baby or just insanly difficult to finish, not because of required skill but of luck. Vastly majority of those quests are, bring this, take that, kill one guy / animal, search for hours,... and they always come with more time spent to run to/from the quest rather to do the quest.
Freeing forts is plain stupid and in the end I can even be attacked afterwards for helping the patriots.
- Main story... in its basics it is interesting but executed purely. Each event does not really make sense.
And everything... everything is done so slowly... animations take ages, most time spent in running from one location to another, even some of the people speak slowly
Maybe for Americans it is interesting to see the guy from history lessons animated in their games but for the rest of the world those are just some dudes and I don't need to know five persons few on the same event when the persons and the event does not mean anything to me.

And things like... 
why are there more soldiers than citizen in towns?
why am I known in the wilds but unkown in the city?
why do I, the proud last american assassin, do delivery jobs for people I don't like or know?
why do I even care about the revolution, as Desmond says several times he doesn't?
why ... just why is this game made to bad?

Update: 
I finished main story and tried King Washington Tyranny DLC. And it is so bad I stopped not even finishing the first part. A LOT of bugs, it seems interesting story but inconsistent, jut bad game design.

Turns out the developers didn’t feel that way, or maybe it was Ubisoft, either way, we got sequels, but they were directly related to AC2, we got Brotherhood and Revelations, games that I don’t personally dislike but that, at the time, I never got to play, because, frankly, I wanted something different for the series, other time period, other historical context, another kind of protagonist, just something that wasn’t the same.

It took them around 4 years to make a different game, it was still Assassin’s Creed, but it was a different character and a different time period.

I pre-ordered the game because at the time there wasn’t as much stigma around doing so, from what I remember at least.

It was also my first lesson as to why I shouldn’t pre-order games.

It was supposed to release at midnight it ended up releasing at 3am that night.

It was hell going for it, but in retrospect it had a bit of an adventurous vibe and I don’t regret waiting till 3am feeling quite groggy only to then go to the game store where they were a bunch of other people like me, dressed the same, even with the same haircut too, it was pretty wild.

The guy at the register looked like he wanted to be anywhere else but there, I got the game, got back home at around 4am and, my grandmother who I was living with at the time, encouraged me to play it, in a way I think she wanted me to enjoy it.

So, I started to play the game and, after two hours or so, I turned off my ps3 and felt cheated and disillusioned about the whole thing.

It was infuriating how terrible it was, I still played it the next day, but I never finished the game, and eventually I even sold it (if my memory serves me right) something that I regret doing today, because then I wouldn’t just have this story but I would have factual proof to go alongside it, then I could stare at the game in my collection and chuckle as I remember how it all went.

Over the years the game got a bit of bad rap, a lot of people disliked the bait and switch of playing initially as a different character than the one in the cover and after a while they disliked the game even further for then making you play as the main character from his childhood to his adulthood.

After a while and today, the game started getting more positive impressions, people generally liked the combat and the mission structure and what used to be considered annoying with the different protagonists and people you got to play as, now is seen for the most part as bold and interesting.

It was definitely a game that made a lot of people discuss it and with this remastered I decided to give the game an actual try and attempt to finish it.

Overall, I enjoyed the game, the stuff I disliked from before I still disliked this time around but it didn’t hinder my experience quite as much, I still enjoyed the combat and the historical recreation of revolutionary America, despite the AI behaving a bit silly at times and stumbling among one another.

I really liked the story as well and how gory the combat system is, it works fairly similar to the past Assassin’s Creed games, you counter then you get the chance to disarm or chain a series of kills, it’s all fairly spectacular and violent, like a ballet of gore that doesn’t demand much from the player in terms of interaction, but that does enough to not make you feel like the game is playing itself.

Biggest issue still remains the pacing however, there are a lot of missions that are devoted to explain to your individual game mechanics, like how to hunt or how to lower your notoriety.

A lot of the times I felt as if these mechanics truly didn’t deserve their own missions, in past AC games you got most of these mechanics and systems explained in a mission or two, in this game it takes them a while till they instruct you into each of them and the saddest thing is that most of these systems aren’t that complicated or difficult to learn to begin with.

 Generally speaking, though I did enjoy my time this time around, a lot of the missions I found to be boring in the past are now relaxing and/or interesting and I appreciated a bit more the themes and the ways such themes were discussed throughout the story this time around, AC3 is widely considered to be the “black sheep” of the “classic” AC games before they changed the series substantially and made it great but completely different games.

I think this remaster is a fantastic way to try the game, is much better optimized than the original title was on pc. Ironically with this remaster I can achieve 60fps in most areas where as in the original game I could not.

The game also looks better generally but there are some sequences and set pieces that in close inspection look worse than the original, although for the most part the graphical and aesthetical changes are an improvement in my honest opinion.

I got the game as part of the gold edition of Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey, it includes which includes all dlc content for Odyssey and 3, including 3’s spin off, Liberation.

But with this remaster, I can say that my opinion has definitely changed. It was a mystery as to why when I started to play the game that it had mixed reviews on Steam. I now know why. 

The game's graphics are barely overhauled with changes seen in regular gameplay, but in term of the cutscenes, they do not seem all too different. This can be easily said for the cutscenes in the Tyranny of King Washington DLC, wherein the scenes are super grainy and blurry, showing obvious evidence that nothing was changed whatsoever. 

In addition to the issues with the graphics, any bugs that were present in the original release, still plague this remaster. Minor bugs throughout games have never bothered me all too much as long as they don't inhibit gameplay or affect the stability of the game. AC 3 Remastered contains both of these problems and more.

Looking back on this game, I only finished the base game and DLC's simply on nostalgia. The passion and love I had for this game will forever be soiled by this remaster, and I can only recommend it to others who want to play it for the same reason, nostalgia. But for others wishing to get into the AC franchise, don't start with this one.

When the games were first coming out, I'd only played the first one on a struggling little laptop. As an adult, I've managed to play and finish AC1, AC2, AC:B, AC:R, and of course decided to play the next in line, AC3.

The story is not terribly interesting compared to the previous installations, and the characters simply lack the character of those in the preceding games. There are interesting historical figures, sure, but they just feel boring, and the ""friendships"" and ""alliances"" if one can call them that between Connor and the other would be assassin recruits feel forced. One second they just met, and in the next, the two act as if they are very close and of the same principle, when in reality, very little dialogue or planning at all has transpired between them. I can go on, but I won't.

The locations are dull and plain. Setting an AC game in the Revolutionary War sounds like an interesting idea, but really as soon as they reached the point of level design, SOMEONE should have pointed out that there isn't anything really amazing about colonial architecture. The frontier is terrible and is an absolute SLOG to get through. Great, more and more two story buildings.

I'd heard a lot of criticism of this game when it first came out, and I must say that none of them seem unfounded now that I've experienced it for myself. I cannot comment on the quality of the remaster, as I did not play the original game when it released. Please see other reviews for a better grasp of it - though from what I've read myself, it appears that this is a shameless Ubisoft cash-grab.

Ultimately, I decided to play this game because I really wanted to know how the Desmond story continued, and am OCD enough that I really wouldn't be able to move on to Assassin's Creed IV, which I intend to do right now, without first having played Assassin's Creed III. I would only recommend people play ACIII for completionist reasons, and basically no other.

It has enough bugs to be considered a beta access game, which I consider unacceptable for a REMASTERED game. I mean you could at least put some effort into quality control.

SPOILERS IN THE BUGS YOU ARE WARNED!!!!

List of a few (not all) the bugs I encountered:

-Guards track you through walls (even if the arrow is grey and they're ""toning down the chase/about to lose you). they just stay there look at you and the chase arrow stays grey but never goes away unless you can move far away enough for the chase to reset (normally it disappears after a certain time the guards don't see you)

-When  looting bodies, the camera angle will lock 1/3 times, it becomes impossible to move your cam unless you take the time to aim with a ranged weapon and move the view around significantly, otherwise the cam just goes back to the angle it had when it locked itself  

-Reflex shot tends to bug out by either not showing the hand or gun animation (one or the other) abd sometimes doesn't even fire, yet still spends your ammo. The sound on it is also bugged when this happens.

-Animals sometimes respawned immediately after the kill right beside me, which is all good an nice until it's a predator or elk which attacks you, which makes it impossible to skin your current kill, but you also can't go away, because not skinning that animal causes you to desync.

-I've had the citizens from citizens missions randomly attack me while I was helping them (they were straight out hostile to me, this shouldn't be) and if you counter, it says you failed the event because you hurt/killed the civilian you were supposed to help (I WAS TRYING TO BUT HE WANTED TO TAKE MY HEAD OFF, DAMN IT UBI)

-Your horse can't back up or move through spaces if he doesn't have at least 1-2 feet between him and the walls of the gap you try to move through, but he can magically pass through when you dismount him. I stopped counting the number of times the horse got caught on terrain and He just stutters and glitches there until I dismount, then he magically stops glitching and gets unstuck like it was the easiest thing in the world. Also if you summon him while on the downward slope of a hill, since it always spawns off cam (which is most often straight behind you) he can spawn under the map, into the hill.

-Rooftop snipers sometimes detected me through walls, enough said

-Voice audio wasn't always present, thank god for subtitles, because otherwise I would have only one end of some of the in-game conversations you have (cinematics included in this)

-Speaking of subtitles, they too are bugged, and will most often go too slow for the conversation which means some of the dialogue doesn't make it's way to the subs you see on screen, meaning again if it's in a convo where you lost some of your voice audio, well you're fucked mate good luck piecing that dialogue together.

-I've had ships bug where the enemy's ship had no reload time, they just constantly fire without end.

-DLC Tyranny of King Washington is completely broken for me, event objectives bug out and get considered  failed main mission objectives, and main mission progress tracks but all collectibles reset once I leave and reload the game (they should not)

-Some DLC content (West Point) is available before events in the game which it references, breaking continuity. (I mean I berat Washington for what happened in Monmouth, but I have yet to meet the guy in the main story (note that this DLC is available while you do the main story, it's activated as soon as you enter New York)

-Enemy ships never take any damage from Rogue waves, no matter their positioning or ship state.

-Some interactive convo markers never dissapear, even if the person has nothing more to say, meaning you never know if that person has new dialogue for you, making it incrediblky tedious to check.

I'll end it there because this is becoming a long list, but there are more, be sure of it

I'll end this with a rant on how they screwed up the free climbing system they spent 4 games tuning beforehand. Let's simplify it so much it breaks it,  sums it up pretty good. seeing as you have no more high/low profile actions. Now you just have plain Free Run mode, which means that your guy will auto jump and grab ledges. But since you don't have to press an additional button to start climbing, you grab on to anything climbable as long as you pass within 1-2 feet of it. And well there are a lot of chases through narrow alleyways that have the immersion ruined because your guy compulsively tries to climb anything within reach, even if it's 45° out of the way you're pointing your joystick. Connor will also almost never take the optimal place to grab when jumping across gaps. For example you jump from 1 roof top to the next, even if you seen him make longer jumps and reach the other side standing and still running, momentum unphased, he will chose to jump down to one of the grips on the wall of smaller gaps rather then jump straight to the other ledge, once again breaking your chase/escape momentum and breaks the flow of the game.

As if all of the above shit wasn't enough, the game has 5 FULL MEMORY SEQUENCES OF INTRO AND TRAINING BEFORE YOU GET TO THE MEAT OF THE GAME. There are 12 sequences in total, meaning almost half the main game is the intro and training.

IT's also the end of Desmond's story, though the Antagonist he releases isn't addressed (only mentioned a few times) in any of the following games, they had to wrap that storyline with a damn comicbook. So the story doesn't really have any impact or repercussions in the following games because the high stakes story they set up at the end of the game, never develops into anything concrete in any other video game of the series that comes after.

All-in-all, the bugs and poor gameplay changes completely ruined this game for me, now that I've 100%, never playing it again and have uninstalled.  Seriously, out of all the games in Assassin's Creed, I've come to understand why this one is the most disliked.

Again, I was randomly search online, then find out they made the story into a comic book, and hardly anyone know that, they never explain in the game, They just abandoned the whole story line.(Glad to see Desmond in Valhalla, Even tho he doesn't have much story to tell.)

Assassin's Creed III is simply boring and a huge mess. Story is boring and long, graphics, for a remaster, are shocking, music is dull and repetitive and even the difficulty for some sections is furiously hard.
The Story starts you off as Haytham Kenway, where you play roughly 3 whole sequences with him, only to then have to start all over with Connor afterwards. The story really only gets good sequence 7 onwards with even then having mostly boring quests and constantly feeling like an errand boy. The VO for Connor isn't great either, with him always feeling like a mopey 16 year-old.
Graphics are honestly shocking. Even more so for a remaster. Revelations looked better than this. In more than a few cutscenes peoples heads turned into cylinders, which was actually quite amusing. Controls were unresponsive, although combat had been slightly improved since revelations.
The Music is terrible and overly repetitive, although the combat and chase music are good and fill the moment with the needed thrill.
Finally, the difficulty. This game isn't actually difficult, but some sections are REALLY badly designed. A chase at the end is so badly designed it takes 30 minutes and a Google search to figure out where to go. And sadly this isnt the only time you have to do this, which is very infuriating.
Overall, Assassins Creed III has some great parts of Story and Gameplay, but honestly feels like a huge waste of time. The story has a confusing and bad ending, the graphics are bad and the overall gameplay is clunky and just makes you want to play something else.
Assassin's Creed III gets a 3/10.

I regret. This game is bad. 

I can't really see what has been remastered, sure the graphics look nice, the forest are pretty, and the towns feel lively. But not spectacular. The cut scenes in particulars are just ugly. Eyes like fishes, dead corpse facial expressions, laughable gestures. Connor still has his fat chin making him look ridiculous, and he tries way to hard, he just feels like a needy brat. Cut scenes are to be skipped.

And oh boy do they like their cut scenes. If you treat this game seriously and want to follow the story, don't. It's bland and childish. And I'm not even speaking of the ""present-day"" part of the game with Desmond Miles aka the most boring character ever - no bad surprise there, its just baffling as expected.
Wouldn't be such a problem if you could easily skip it and enjoy the game as a sand-box. But no. This is an AC where everything is locked behind the story line. You have to spend HOURS with Haytham B-lining the tutorial section before starting the real story. And then you're not done. You still need to spend an incredible amount of time with Connor to unlock most of the maps and mechanics, and for it you have to cope with uninteresting cut scenes with uninteresting missions between. N.Y map for instance : you're coming to New York through a mission. Once there, you  can NOT explore the city, you HAVE to follow some block on its horse and hear its sob story. Then a 'tail that convenient weird guy' mission occurs. Then boring eavesdrop on say guy. Then boring city street chase. Then prison. Then dumb, slowmo assassination. Then you come back in the present as Desmond (fun fact: as Desmond, you don't have displayed objective, so if you skip cutscenes, you just have to guess what to do. Fortunately, you just have to run everywhere like a wild goose, a cutscenes to the next chapter will trigger soon enough). You NEVER had the chance to explore New York, you just pass through in a never ending row of (boring and insipid) cutscenes, loading screens and dumb missions. I skipped EVERY cutscenes and it still took me nearly 2 hours of boilerplate gameplay - and I still can't explore NY by myself !.
In general, 80% of missions are just going from point A to point B, to trigger another cut scene. And this is not going parkour-like, stealthy and such. You have to do it on horse, or in the middle of nowhere, or following Jon MacSlowy telling you how badies are bad and goodies are good - and you can't stop sticking its boot because the mission will abort if you're too far. Sometimes there are some explosions or filters to make you feel a bit under stress, but the mission is still the same : just press Z (or W), slighty move your mouse, your done! Some quests (for instance when Achilles sends you in the far side of the Manor map to gather a futile item - deep in a cave ofc) even DISABLE fast travel to force you cross the entire map, running several minutes in the most undesired and artificial way. It's so boring and preposterous. Then you have some stats about random events which occured or not during your stroll, and impact the level of synchronization, then a loading screen, then the next cut scenes. 

Character controls and interactions with scenery make me sad. They're awful. In the Frontier map, 50% of viewpoints are the same tree, recycled over and over again. And this tree is just a pain to climb up to. Now that I know how to deal with it, it takes me 3 or 4 times to climb it. Connor desperately wants to jump out this fricking tree, he's so damn mesmerized by hay or something. He's also commonly glitching into an impressive amount of game artifacts, sometimes during mission, which is quite frustrating as save points are erratic at best and you often respawn way before the point you were stuck. Did I mention the missions where horrendously boring? Maybe because you don't have much to do in them, but must endure it several times.
Combats are not that interesting, and repetitive. And what's the point of knocking down an opponent if you can't finish him while he's down? Yeah that's it with big targets: they attack, you block, then kick them off in counter... then wait them to pick themselves up. You, as a gamer, are spamming the attack button ; Connor just awkwardly wave his weapon upon his opponent. Any game would allow you, with skills, to shorten a boss fight. This one don't, you just have to repeat your routine 5 or 6 times and the guy's finally done.

The optional missions are a failure too. Most are just the same as main missions : going to point A to point B (everybody needs a postman). And even if you select the ""interesting"" ones, hunting for instance, the mission will change if you approach a interesting point, a fort say. I was hunting a legendary bobcat, and in the middle of the chase: ""hey look at these bloody redcoats! let's go nuts and trash their place for no well explained reason"". Thanks game for screwing yourself. Of course the bobcat mission needs you to go far away to respawn, and in this map (Frontier) which is HUGE, there are... 4 fast travel points, right in the far side of the map. Genius.

But well, if you spend 6 or 7 hours B-lining the main story, you can then cool off your frustration by having a nice walk in the woods - which are nice it's true. That's what I like in AC: the sense of freedom. Chilling out, hunting, leveling up my town, crafting, trading (oh god don't get me started on the inventory/crafting/trading interface...).

Dialogues and voice acting (excluding Haytham, Lee, Achilles) were truthfully miserable (especially homestead missions - base building - were absolutely horrible). All synchronization viewpoints are the same. Assassination missions in previous games were mini-missions, now it's literally just ""see nameless guy, kill him"". Gone is a beautiful historical city with remarkable landmarks, here comes... bland urban area. Yeah, you can run in the tree-line, but it feels mostly made for specific missions and running on horseback through the forest is one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in a while.

* Excellent graphics - you can tell they upgraded the texture, lighting and LOD quality significantly 
* Naval Combat is great
* They re-did the mini-map and main maps - better, more colorful, easier to read
* AC3 still has the best combat system in all of the Assassin's Creed series. Excellent animations, human shields which act as a very viable and logical way to engage enemies at close range with firearms and survive
* Improved the crafting system - fixed some of the bugs and navigation
* They added in some side content missions that were originally PS3 exclusive (Benedict Arnold Missions)
* The music in AC3 is pretty darn good - not as good as the Ezio games, but still really good, especially the patriotic theme
* Despite Connor himself not being my favorite Assassin, I always thought his outfit was pretty awesome. It fit the location really well and looked cool

Cons:

* Wish they had gotten rid of the ""constraint"" system on missions - the poorly implemented constraints were something that were heavily criticized back when this game was first released - sometimes they flat out don't work, sometimes they're just stupid / make no sense within the context of the mission, and in many cases you don't even see them display as they pop up DURING the mission while you're in the middle of a chase
* Building on the above point, honestly the biggest problem with AC3 is the mission design. Many of the missions are so poorly designed that it can infuriate the player - if you aren't an absolute expert with the stealth / sneak system and know exactly how enemies will behave in certain situations, chances are high that you will desync missions frequently 
* There are also some missions where, due to targeting bugs, and other wonky movement behavior, you can desync by your horse just stopping during a ride for no reason or your gun not firing no matter how many times you push the fire button, etc. This game is a text-book example of why Ubisoft's QA department has the reputation that they do throughout the world
* They still have not fixed the broken stealth system where Connor will not hide in the bushes properly if anyone is looking his way - this issue does not exist in AC4 / Rogue
* The tailing system in AC3 is absolutely abysmal. I don't mind tailing missions like some people seem to, but they just need to be implemented far better
* Never been a fan of the AC3+ movement system of just holding RT and having the system auto-pilot for you - for multiple reasons. 1.) It limits your control, sometimes your character will jump or climb buildings aggressively when you don't want to. 2.) It's just sloppy and takes away some of the enjoyment of the climbing system. 3.) I miss feeling like I was doing some of the climbing myself in the earlier Ezio games where sometimes you had to use the Climb Leap technique to reach certain holding points, etc. 

Game Length: Assassin's Creed 3 took me 56 hours. I did nearly everything except collecting feathers (since they play no part narratively in the story). 

Final Rating for AC3 (does not include Liberation): 9/10 - this was a really well done Remaster. I don't know why I see so much negativity on it on the messageboards. It runs fantastic, the textures and visual quality upgrades are great and I didn't really run into any new bugs. Some bugs from the original game were fixed, but not all. I'd say with this game and Liberation included, you should feel comfortable picking it up for $10-15. Honestly if you own the original game, think of the Remaster as just paying for a DLC that includes an image quality overhaul

Liberation Remaster Review (below): Wanted to put a section into this review dedicated to AC Liberation since it's included as part of the game, although it's my first time playing it -

Pros: 

* New Orleans is pretty
* I enjoy Aveline's different outfits / personas that give her different skills and vulnerabilities - this adds an angle of realism for blending that hasn't been in any previous games. It's also good to see Ubisoft actually innovate a little bit with something like this instead of just going vanilla or copying mechanics from other games 
* Combat system is a clone of AC3 (great mechanics)
* The Bayou location is really well-rendered and pretty as well (a very unique location). There is a lot of really good free-running via the trees in the Bayou
* Aveline acquires a pretty cool tool to use - a dart gun via her umbrella as a lady which I thought was good ingenuity - Assassins would generally come up with pretty good tools for sneaking around and killing people undetected which I think is a mechanic that's a bit under-utilized in the series along with disguises which this game makes good use of on both fronts 
* <light spoiler> - I liked Aveline's outfit for the snow during one of the later missions in New York, designers did a nice job with that by adding the fur in the right areas, looks very sleek, and also that Connor was in the game briefly 

Cons: 

* The game runs like crap - a lot of hitching and a lack of smooth framerates. I did some research on it and it appears the game was originally developed for the PS VITA so I suspect the engine simply isn't as robust as the AC3 engine and as a result struggles with modern graphics features
* Game does not seem to recognize DSR resolution options or various display ratios - it's just a poorly coded game in terms of graphics options and performance 
* The game crashes whenever you quit the game (hello Ubisoft QA)
* Aveline copies Connor's combat animations - she should have her own. Lazy development
* There's no present-day story in the game, so really no context in how it connects to the present day storyline
* Same bad mission constraint system as AC3
* The voice actress for Aveline is the same girl that did Cristina in AC Brotherhood - nothing wrong with her, but it's so obvious that it's a little irking and removes any immersion every time Aveline talks as I hear Cristina, not Aveline. This is a common issue with Ubisoft games - they frequently use the same voice actors for multiple characters in the same franchises and it hurts immersion
* They don't do a very good job of fleshing out the story - it feels very disjointed like they don't give you enough details on what's going on so sometimes you're wondering about story details and a ton of time passes between sequences (years) so it makes you wonder what's happening during those long stretches of time
* No real fast travel. And there are a bunch of instances where you have to travel across the city - sucks to have to walk / run ~300-400 units frequently throughout the game due to no fast travel
* Mission design is exceedingly poor. You'll frequently have no idea why you're doing things and / or wonder how Aveline just knows to go to a specific part of the city to do a mission or find a missing person, etc 
* Map design is also infuriating, particularly in the Bayou - it's fun to move through the trees in the Bayou, and very pretty during the day, also, but when you are in areas where you have to move on the ground, navigation is tedious and unenjoyable 
* During the game you'll use a canoe in certain areas of the Bayou and Mexico to move around - the canoe steering controls are about as bad as could be 
* In typical Ubisoft fashion there's a good bit of feminism / wokeness in the game which is a turnoff for normal folks 

Game Length: ~16 hours - I did most things in the game minus some of the collectibles. I imagine if you did every little thing you'd be looking at around ~20 hours total 

Final Rating (Liberation): 5/10 - This game has a lot of issues as outlined in the cons and they are pretty major. Too many for me to recommend it 

Final Rating (Liberation + AC3): 7/10. Overall between both games, I'd recommend because of AC3, just go into Liberation with low expectations.",1617935182,1620787194,True,25,2,0.750864148139953613,0,True,False,False

To begin with, this is a great deal if you have Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Season Pass with it. You get this game for free so no complains about that. If you unfortunately want to buy this game as a standalone product then rather save more money and buy something else. This game is definitely NOT worth $40 whatsoever.

First I am gonna talk about some downs. This game, as every product by Ubisoft, has lots of bugs, errors and crashes. This game is particularly for some reason very unfriendly with my hardware. This is not happening to everyone, but for some reason I am experiencing screen flickering and I got BSOD 3 times so far and I tried to fix it but nothing worked. That is indeed very annoying but I was very persistent and I managed to do solid 51% of the game. Then another issue is definitely character models. I guess you have seen many pictures on the internet where people compared Remastered and Original version. Do not worry. It is not as bad as those pictures show, but it is also not good either. (The pictures on the internet are mostly on bad display and graphics settings so they look worse than they actually are). The characters lost their shading which was making their faces look more realistic, lightning is improved ONLY on environment but completely screwed on characters' faces. They indeed in most of the moments look very bad compared to the original game. The characters never had eyelashes anyway so this new character modeling makes that even more noticeable and their eyes indeed look really weird. The facial animations also got really weird as much as they also lost their facial details. Lip sync is still screwed as much as it was before. Quite a down is also not having multiplayer and some players have experienced the issue of missing some side missions too.
Now to add some ups of this game, I think they also improved lots of stuff and the first thing is definitely environment. You can indeed notice the difference in textures, shading and lightning of the buildings. The parkour is also very enjoyable, the animations are smooth, they made controls easier so now you can free run with only Shift and it brings the old good feeling of an Assassin's Creed game of course. They also added some new sounds, there are more animals, although I haven't really noticed that the cities became more crowded. As much as I remember they still remain the same, but almost nobody cares about this feature anyway. The less tackling the better. The really good thing is that they added more legacy outfits which is amazing but Alexios's outfit doesn't really suit Connor, it is quite bad. The gameplay atmosphere also became ""happier"". The nature really looks beautiful and you will indeed enjoy while playing those Homestead Missions once again. 

They also changed icons from white to yellow and the old white loading screen which was probably giving you flashbacks all the time is now changed too and they put black instead.

Overall I think this game could have been made better, maybe more friendly with every hardware, every software, they could have perhaps taken more time to do characters properly, but I had a bit of a fun to play as the true Assassin once again, in higher resolution of course, and I loved that they added more legacy outfits.

Well, so far in terms of gameplay I feel rather let down.  The controls feel clunky and some of the combat has quick-time events that feel unnecessary.  At points the game will show combat tips which often vanish before you have time to read the full message.

Perhaps the most frustrating part is that after getting past the very linear first part of the game and finally feeling like I have more freedom to explore, the game introduced a new feature in the way of crafting through the ledger system, which is massively bugged and has managed to glitch to the point where I cannot open the ledger without my controls completely locking up.  And because of the auto-save system that the game relies on, I don't have the option of reverting to a previous save.  Some quick Googling for potential fixes and it turns out this bug has been a known issue ever since the original release of the game back in 2012; they've had years to fix a game breaking bug and done nothing?  A disappointing effort all around.

This is a decent game which brought a lot of new things to the series. It's just a shame this one was where the story really fell apart. 

Note: I'm mainly reviewing the original here, not the remastered version, since you can't even buy the original one anymore, it felt pointless to do it there. I have played the remastered one and it was fine I think, didn't notice that much of a difference to be honest. I don't remember that many glitches.

Gameplay

The gameplay is solid. Cool combat, stealth and exploration. This game also introduced the naval gameplay which has since become a staple of the series. No complaints here.

Story

Why wasn't this Desmond's game? The overarching plot of the previous 4 games was so clearly leading to that but then they just decide to go with a brand new time period and a new ancestor at the last minute right before the climax? Huh? I mean there's nothing wrong with that inherently, it just made so little sense narratively. I get they were looking for the vault and all that but why? Why couldn't they just have had this set in the modern day, maybe with a few past segments here and there? That would have been so much cooler and a much more satisfying conclusion to Desmond's story in my opinion. 

Or they could have even continued his story in the modern day and split the series in two with this one: One like watchdogs for the modern day story and one for the genetic memory, treasure hunt through time stuff. Two series out of one. That would have been cool.

-SPOILER-

But no, all that build up just to have Desmond touch an orb and die. What.

-END OF SPOILER-

I actually liked Haytham though, he was cool.

Given that its suppose to be a ""remaster,"" it is unbelievable how many bugs there still are. Voice lines will overlap, subtitles will not play at the right times that the dialogue does, animations in cutscenes are sometimes bugged to make characters stiff and motionless, enemies will get stuck in areas you can't kill them, and the parkour and gameplay can be so janky at times.

Remaster was something, I was looking for, to see the game in a new coat, with improved quality of life, addressed problems from 2012 release et cetera.

Boy, if I was mistaken with my expectations. If I wanted to point out every single bug, every single glitch which made me restart the game, I could write a thesis. Lets point out a few, that were annoying as hell.

Audio glitch - Damn, that was something extra. At one point of the game, I had three different soundtracks playing at the same time. When I was checking if it can be fixed, all Ubisoft did about it was telling the players ""restart their games"". Lovely.

Missing NPCs - Nothing makes the game better than crucial NPC just disappearing from the game. (probably couldn't stand the Bugmaster either). 

More invisible walls - YAY! Riding a horse on the road and all of a sudden can't move, cause some force throw an invisible wall in front of me with size of the whole road and something extra.

""Little things"" that should have some honorable mentions. 

1. Original AC3 problems didn't get addressed (of course). Taking a quest from an NPC, markers did not appear, had to re-save the game and wait till the NPC shows up again, that's some good old AC3 problem.

2. NPCs stuck in objects, preventing me from finish objectives, like liberating people from convoys et cetera (TOKW)

3. Try to corner-kill as little enemies as possible, especially if there is a chest ;) ... Sometimes they don't die, they just pretend they are dead, getting alarmed by your pressence and you can't do a thing about it except ... restarting the game, so you can approach it differently and open it.

All in all huge disappointment, if you got this game with Origins (I think it was that special offer) and have nerves of steel, go and give it a shot, it has it's positive side... sort of. If you didn't get it, stay the hell away from it, especially if it has 40€ price tag on it, definitely not worth that price.

Wherein the other installments would have one or two things to hunt for with these objects being within a dozen or two items ACIII has over a hundred or so things to scavenger hunt.

Although little has really changed from AC3 to AC3 remastered, apart from the graphics, and seeing which way your enemy faces is much needed improvement.

You still find it hard to play to the point you be googling how to play this game just as much as you are playing it because you do not understand why they done it like that. For example, the challenges from the Frontier, Thief and Boston Brewers are all recorded in the map section? (like the original I believe) It would have been a good time for Ubi to Sync that to the DNA Tracker like in AC4.

I did, I might regret this ""lose my self in the game"" for a few days and the bugs were far less making game play very enjoyable.

Now AC3 Liberation was an ok game. I not played it before this remastred. I really lacked the “lose myself in the game” and just wished I could complete this faster so I could go forward onto AC4. That and the bugs in this game is horrendous worst I have seen in any AC game to date. their loads of places to get stuck in free roam, so you need to exit and load again, lose progress. You get stuck after or in fights and the Take no damage fight are truly screen hitting times, enjoy, I NOT going though that again...

I am tbh really surprised, maybe not that this is even on Steam tbh. Ubi probably should have kept it for them self because I cannot imagine anyone really buying this if they already brought AC3 before. I got this via AC: Odyssey and tbh regardless I would not pay £33.99 for the 2 games and the DLC. Its all is ridiculously overpriced and for nothing new. Personally, I think they were stabbing in the dark with their hidden blade with this one.

If you not played AC3, I would then day buy this one over the Original you get much more content and better graphics. I just seen you can buy the Original on Steam or Ubisoft website. So this is as good as your going to get.

Not a bad game, but Jesus there are some ANNOYING bugs, especially with map markers just not showing up in the two main cities for liberation missions and THE LEGWORK that just inflates your play time.  I got about 55-60 hours out of this doing every mission, nabbing every collectible, all upgrades, homestead things, the ship things, I would say a good 5 hours were just uncovering the maps and getting to things.

When it comes down to it, this is one of my favorite games in the AC series because of the wide range of environment. That being said, the story is incredibly lackluster, feeling more like a weird interactive PBS kids special than a fun game. There are elements that are interesting, but overall it's a stale story. The conclusion of Desmond's participation in the overarching story isn't as fantastic as you'd hope for someone you spent the last five games playing as. The gameplay itself suffered in some weird ways. I didn't get a lot of the Homestead missions until after the story, at which point it felt like I was rushing through something that was supposed to take a longer period of time to do. 

Connor is a stiff character that doesn't really exhibit any personality. In some games, this kind of protagonist is great because you can mentally insert yourself a bit more. But following a protagonist as charismatic as Ezio, it's a disappointing change. Achilles is the highlight of the story, with regards to characters, though the inhabitants of the Homestead are also pretty interesting and fun. 

As with the previous entries, I wouldn't skip this one if you enjoy the overall story of the series. But if you're not a fan of American history or want a more interesting main character, you're probably safe to skip this one.",1614046491,1614046491,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So this game is, essentially, a series of mini-games. Each mini-game has two Success states: Perfect & Imperfect, based on how well you manage the optional goals. You can Fail, in which case you simply restart the mini-game. Nail all Optionals and you get Full Synchronisation. Nailing some of them appears identical to doing none. I have, frankly, no idea what the difference is in terms of 'rewards' for achieving perfect sync, other than some in-game cosmetics. I'm playing as Total Psycho, killing freely and not caring *at all* about Optionals. I've managed some parts perfectly by pure luck. I'm zipping through the game with no obvious issues. I consider this ideal, since I'm playing purely to catch up on the series.

Closing note: We, gamers, need to have a serious chat with game developers about *incredibly annoying* final sequences. The kind of thing where you're stripped of abilities and have instant-fail mechanics, and have to redo the entire sequence if you make a single mistake. This game has one of those endings (two, really), where they 'ramp up the tension' by just making the game suck. This is not cool or fun. It actually kills otherwise amazing experiences.

One is the game itself of course, while the other is the ""Remastered"" part. As a remaster, this is very disappointing and improvements are slim to none (at least on PC). In fact because the lighting is heavily altered in this remaster, certain cutscenes will have character models looking much worse than they did in the original purely because of unintended lighting effects on characters' faces and such. This ""remaster"" on PC is essentially just slightly improved render distance and UI elements.

Remaster aside, Assassin's Creed III on its own is mostly mediocre. If you've played 1 through Revelations and you're invested in the story at this point, I recommend this game to at the very least see the continuation of those stories (at least for modern day and First Civilization storylines).

That being said, this is potentially one of the weakest entries in the series. Unlikable protagonist and mentor, largely forgettable cast of side characters, a setting that is not well-suited for the free-running gameplay, lifeless and uninteresting side content. The modern day story has some interesting missions you play as Desmond, but the ending was so awful that modern day has never been able to recover since. The only saving grace I could find was Haytham Kenway, who not only breathes much needed perspective on the Templar Order, but also ends up being one of the most compelling antagonists in the series. The story overall has a few highlights, but is ends up falling flat.

Free-running has been fully re-worked from the previous games thanks to the new engine, and the animations have been drastically improved. This allowed parkour on more complex architecture, including trees in the wilderness, as well as more fluid movement. Unfortunately the aforementioned issue with the setting has led to this new parkour system being largely wasted. Previous entries would occasionally have the player perform certain inputs in order to do more complex moves such as side-ejects, climb leaps, etc. or the buildings would sometimes require the player to plan the right path in order to climb it. Both of these aspects of parkour have been largely removed, and now almost all climbing is simply holding RT and forward. While it is prettier to look at now, it feels shallow and boring to play.

Combat has been more or less improved from the Ezio trilogy. Although countering is still the most viable combat option, you will now have to use other combat options as well since any non-basic enemies will be invulnerable to this move. Guns are pretty prominent in this period, you will see them quite a bit in combat and either have to use someone as a human shield or run away in time before getting shot. The new engine has improved animations in this area as well and overall the combat is not only the most satisfying visually, but the most complex (so far).

Overall, while the game is certainly not bad, it fails to be great in any aspect. I recommend purely for people already invested in the franchise as a whole... otherwise the Ezio Trilogy and Black Flag are perfectly fine to play on their own.",1612759359,1612759359,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really loved AC3, as it was my first AC game and thus made me a fan of the series (I own all games in the franchise, even the Chronicles/2.5D ones), but I get frequent frame drops to zero about once a minute (or even more often, depending on background apps and for some weird reason, whether the controller is connected seems to make a difference to the frequency in which the issue appears).
I wrote to Ubisoft and provided them with numerous files (from system config files to images of resource usage and a video of the issue), but they couldn't suggest any solutions.
Unfortunately, I have read forum posts on other sites where people with computers way faster than mine (see my profile for my specs) - including some using new Intel CPUs and Nvidia GeForce 2080 GPUs - are having the same issues, so it's obviously not an AMD-related problem. Thus, as much as I love this game, given how badly the remaster was mishandled/botched I would recommend trying to get a steam key for the original version instead (some resellers like Kinguin still offer legit steam keys for the original game, even though it's no longer officially sold on Steam).",1612503240,1612503310,False,3,0,0.481797665357589722,0,True,False,False

Combat system is just a mess. In some parts of the unarmed combat, the game engine just reuse the sword blocking animation for unarmed blocking. It looks something like the opponent is blocking your attack with a sword, but the game engine just made the sword invisible.

The story is amazing and even the extra DLC story content is surprisingly good as I thought it would disappoint me but in the end it turned out to be amazing.

I know a lot of die hard AC fans are going to probably hate me for this, but I really liked AC 3. It has definitely had the best music so far for me and the trailer was pretty cool too. I liked how you played as the templars at one point and the assassins in another. I like Conor as a character. Sure the story may be a little rough but its still a really good game. The remastered version plus max pc quality settings it looks great. I must say the King Washington DLC was absolutely amazing. It was definitely my favorite part out of the whole game. Also be aware that you can fast travel to the yellow mission locations so don't spend a lot of time traveling several hundred meters for nothing. Also you get extra cosmetics when the game connects to Uplay. You can access them once you read sequence 6 I believe so don't just let it sit there. Smoke bombs are your friend for taking out large groups. I won't spoil it too much but overall great game!

For Assassins Creed Liberation I loved the story as well. Seeing a different main character was also nice. I loved the crossover mission they had for liberation and AC 3. It was a very cool edition. Unfortunately for me, this is my first time playing the Assassins Creed Series and like an idiot I assumed I had to play 1, 2, and 3 because that was the order I thought it meant but I found out once I beat AC 3 Brotherhood, and revelations come first before AC 3 and Liberation, but since I already beat AC 3 I thought might I well complete liberation. I enjoyed the story a lot in this game. Unfortunately you cannot really fast travel to missions. A tip for you. Smoke bombs are your friend in the final boss fights. I really enjoyed this game. If you have a chance to buy the gold edition of Odyssey it includes AC 3 and liberation. Get it on sale and its like $14. Fare warning in order to play the two games you have to download odyssey and open the game and then close out. Once that is done youre given the code for the two games. I found this out eventually through reddit. So now all of you don't have to go through the pain of figuring it out. But 3 games for $14 is a steal. I would highly recommend playing these two games.

Ludicrous bugs that have yet to be addressed (infinitely spawning guards, objectives failing at random, glitching models notably when falling, environmental clipping errors, NPCs that sporadically disappear, etc) despite the years and the so-called ""remaster.""

A central protagonist with all the charisma of a rock and a voice actor that does his utmost to impersonate one.

Abysmal attempt at recreating the period, with inaccurate attire, weaponry, social structures (including racial and gender representations that would lead you to believe two-thirds of colonial America was comprised of free blacks and women) that make a mockery of American history for the sake of appeasing contemporary mores.

The ""hunting"" feature is entirely superfluous and objectively baffling: animals spawn atop one another, bears move in packs (I slaughtered sixteen in a single wooded grove... bears, the enormous terrestrial predators that are notoriously solitary) while wolf packs are seldom more than three wolves.

The less said about the addition of quicktime events the better. Courtesy of such, a single wolf is a more significant threat than an entire squad of men with rifles.

Counters no longer reliably lead to a kill. More often than not, Conner will simply toss the offending soldier aside, rather than kill them outright even when wielding the hidden blades (unlike Altair and Ezio who were both consummate fighters). It conveys a radical and unwarranted sense of pacifism on his part, completely out of touch with his in-game character, as he's seemingly desperate to avoid harming anyone while unnecessarily prolonging the fights.

The notoriety system is COMPLETELY broken.
Engage in ""open conflict"" with a guard, even if it's a single person in a back alley with no witnesses: it will contribute to your notoriety. Kill some in the woods near a rural area: the guards in the city know and are on alert. Posters to remove your notoriety infrequently appear and demand you be ""anonymous"" to interact... because heaven forbid you tear a poster down in the midst of a fight? Kill a single guard, climb a building and watch as every road is suddenly filled with guards, whose floating GUI blips appear to indicate they're unaware of your location... yet they're all facing you and lined up to block the roads.

Worse yet: reach three stars and the guards begin spawning infinitely.
Right in front of you. Literal nine man squads materialize out of the void.

Half the time the buttons don't respond, and when they do it doesn't help cause you've been screwed over six times already. When I have to restart a segment of a memory 10 times because the game refused to running assassinate even when I held the buttons to do so, then I think it's safe to say someone needs to check the code again. And while you're in there, you should also fix how much you're telling the player. This game has a chronic problem with telling the player either too much or too little. The game will lock the camera into certain positions to try and show you where to climb to. Not a bad idea with esoteric level designs like on a cliff face, but I think I can figure out that the obviously climbable wooden planks are climbable. And how about when the game says to kill someone before they reach a location? Okay simple enough the game was telling me to chase him, there will obviously be a place for me to use my hidden blades to kill him. Nope. He stays just out of reach and you don't know until it's too late. And by god, who was bug fixing because they clearly slacked. Try and kill an animal above, have fun falling through the floor. Want to complete liberation missions, this one will inexplicably disappear from the map forcing you to wander around until you can find it again.

As this is a remaster of the original AC III, the storyline and gameplay are essentially unchanged, apart from minor improvements such as being able to double-assassinate more easily and an upgraded minimap. One note here, though: after playing Origins and Odyssey, the combat and control fluidity definitely feel a bit primitive, so do be warned of that.

The biggest upside is naturally the graphical quality; almost all textures in the environment have been brought up to newer standards. Despite this, it appears that very little has been done to improve the character models - faces in particular are laughably unrealistic and the game still very much shows its age in this regard.

Overall opinion: This is a fairly good remaster of AC III in terms of some graphical and gameplay quality-of-life enhancements, but also comes up short in some areas. I've given it the 'negative' review because of the simple fact that this product, as a standalone, is certainly not worth the $40 price, though as part of the AC Odyssey season pass, I would say that it's a nice benefit.

And I actually had a lot of fun with this DLC, without spoiling too much, you're given abilities that you don't have in any other Creed game. It made everything kind of worth it.

In AC3, the main story severely lack the feeling of an assassin and not so open. Usually, it has only a few options (or only one way) to finish the main objective, not to mention the side objectives (which point out to only specific moves). The objectives are also annoying as they are shown while the mission runs and you may not have time to carefully read what you have to do. And yes, in many occasions they are fights against the time. The spawn point is another annoying flaw; sometimes the game loads on an open ground where guards are going to start a conflict in a second, while I couldn't even recognize the environment. Connor can better be a postman, a merchant, a sailor or even a commander, but less being a real assassin if you don't spend time walking around the city and try to find someone to kill. Connor often forces himself into an open conflict by the story - so, would be better described as a furious warrior. I understand that the devs try to be more creative and introduce various things to play, but I think the main concept of being an assassin is degraded. There are lots of tools for assassination but only a few occasions to really use it, again if you don't try to find a random kill. Guards are always present in a large group or adjacent to each other, despite lack of crowd-control tools to use so, usually end up an open conflict. Also lots of guards are not shown on the mini-map or even show up from nowhere (not sure it's a bug or intentionally make it more difficult). The story it self is insensible in many points. [spoiler] Once, it said the British army was marching to lay siege on New York, the Patriot's HQ; but what I really found was New York full of British guards and flags - so, they were attacking their own city? Another point, Connor walked towards his life-long target and several guards only to say 'Hi, I come to kill you' and let him get away. He can kill dozens of guards in combat, but easily got caught by a few weaklings, unable to resist!!! [/spoiler] The graphics of city areas are magnificent, but the Frontier (forests and mountains) is not impressive - I thought the beauty of American nature was the highlight of this game. The TKW DLC is far better than the main story, offering a super hero version of Connor and more a deadly assassin with all-new play tactics - though other flaws are still present. Lots of promoting media show Connor fighting in a battlefield - the game really far from that.

For Liberation, the game is quit short and fewer elements to play with. However, it gave me more sense of assassin than AC3. The multi-persona theme is interesting and the maps look better though with some compromised graphics. Most elements in the game are too straight-forward and almost no alternative options are present for each mission, just follow the guide. I feel the story more sensible than AC3 though not as interesting as other ACs. If you accept Liberation as a compact AC side-game, I would say it fulfills its job.",1609190919,1609190919,False,2,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

Assassin's Creed 3 is a mayor improvement from Assassin's Creed Revelations and earlier titles when comparing in terms of graphics, map, combat system, parkour and other game mechanics in my opinion. It's important to separate what was already featured in the original Assassin's Creed 3 and the remastered. In both versions the graphics are a clear big improvement where the remastered is somewhat better. In comparison with the Ezio games, the total of size of the games maps is also bigger than any other. The kill animations are more brutal and the combat is far better. The game features assassinations with other weapons than the hidden blade, fully developed gun aim and control plus bow and arrow, fast travel from anywhere, mini games (board games), big naval combat and missions and animal hunting. 

The story is rather different from earlier games as you start with playing as Haytham Kenway but then play as Connor who is on a quest for revenge and change in the colonies. Unlike the last game where the map was only to be revealed by synchronizing on various point, this game take the concept where you ha to fill the map by walking through it with the help of some synchronizing points. I am personally not fully a fan of this as it take a lot of time to reveal the whole map since the radius of uncovering is rather small compared with the size of the maps. Then there are many side quest like ""The Common Man"" or frontier quest that makes 100% completion a bit dragged out. Now, the remastered wouldn't be such a problem if it weren't for some bugs which makes playing the games at times frustrating. Such as the freezing/stuttering bug that would show up from the start to about 15 hours playtime. But with the fact that the game comes with Assassin's Creed Odyssey I can see past most of the negative experience. 

7/10

[h1] DLC: The Tyranny of King Washington [/h1]
The Tyranny of King Washington DLC on the other hand is honestly just unnecessary. It basically tells of a what if scenario that reuses previous map and adds a few new missions. Thankfully the DLC comes fully in the game the DLC has no real impact on canon. In the DLC you get to have 3 types of superpowers which I think was rather unfitting for this game. Also the DLC isn't bug free either which makes it less appealing to play. 

5/10

[h1] Assassin's Creed Liberation REMASTERED [/h1]
This game is quite familiar to Assassin's Creed 3 in aspect of graphics, game mechanics and bugs. The storyline is somewhat short but honestly I think that is perfect as some games need to be shorter than others to make the longer games better. Also with the smaller map, a shorter story fits better. The game features a new interning mechanic where the player can switch between different personas, ""The Assassin"", ""The Lady"" (civilian) and ""The Slave"" (something more in the middle), who have then has specific missions to said personas. Another new feature is chain-kill, which allowed Aveline to take out multiple opponents during combat which can speed combat up somewhat. My major problem with this game is first the need to walk around the map to uncover the map like Assassin's Creed 3. The second major problem is the smuggler bug which makes the player unable to finish a specific mission even though the mission wont effect 100% sync or achievements. But with the fact that the game comes with Assassin's Creed Odyssey I can see past most of the negative experience.

I will reviewing this game as a whole, not just the remaster.
Assassin's Creed III was the first I played in the series, and therefore I kind of hold it above the rest. It is my favorite in the series, and while it has its issues, there is plenty to love. I 100%ed the game on the Xbox 360.
The story is pretty good, taking place during the American Revolution. While the main story can kinda be seen as a revenge story, I think there's enough twists and interesting moments to keep it interesting. Besides, revenge can be a great motivation for a story all on its own. The graphics look pretty decent, especially the lighting. The faces can look a little clay-like, but I feel like that's pretty common for games that came out around the same time (the remaster did help quite a bit, in my opinion.)
The gameplay is excellent. The combat is different from the previous games, and I don't think the change is good or bad. It's just different, and I like it. It reminds me of games like Shadow of Mordor or the Batman Arkham series, but is still unique enough to be its own system. There's also plenty of sneaking and assassinating, and there are also naval missions. If you've played Black Flag or Rogue before, they're not too special, but if this is your first time hitting the seas in an Assassin's Creed game, it's great fun! Free running has also been reworked, and this is something that I have mixed feelings on. When it works, and Connor (your character) does what you want, it feels great. But it can become pretty frustrating pretty fast. Sometimes I feel like I have less control than I did with Ezio in the previous games, and sometimes I feel like I'm a hardcore parkour king. It really just takes patience and practice.
There are some downsides. Probably the most frustrating thing that I ran into was that my horse kept getting stuck on random bits of terrain. I know that sounds like a silly complaint, but it's pretty annoying when you're trying to chase someone down and your horse gets stuck on a tree. Another thing that can be bothersome is if you try to 100% the game, the optional side objectives are a nightmare. Back on the Xbox 360, I did get 100% synchronization, and on some of the levels, it just isn't fun. That's why if you're on your first playthrough, I'd recommend ignoring them or only doing the easier ones, because restarting all the time to try to get the optional objectives can be really frustrating and destroy the pacing and fun of the missions.
Overall though, this is a wonderful game. I would definitely recommend it to fans of 3rd person action/adventure games and of course to AC fans. It's different enough from the previous titles but still retains the AC feel.

Assassin's Creed: Liberation
This game also comes with AC: Liberation, which is a remaster of the PS Vita game. While many don't consider it to be a mainline game, I definitely think it's worth a playthrough. The gameplay will feel very familiar after having played AC 3, and while there are no naval missions, the gameplay that is on offer is still excellent and varied. A new mechanic that's introduced is the persona system, where you can change your outfit depending on the situation you're going into. If you need to do some fighting, best to go in your Assassin gear. If you need to do some blending in, dress as a lady and wander the streets charming all the men in town. If you need to blend in with the crowd, but still be able to get dirty if you need to, then you can dress up as a slave and blend in with the New Orleans population.
I actually like the story. It's very short, since this was originally a handheld game, however it gets right to the point and isn't bloated like a lot of games can end up being. The main character Aveline is an excellent character and I really got to like her by the end of the game.
Liberation, while short, is definitely worth a playthrough, even if it is just for the main story. You could honestly probably beat it in about 12 hours or less, depending on how quickly you go.",1608443504,1608443577,True,14,0,0.638856768608093262,1,True,False,False

Assassin’s Creed III is a game that has a good main story, great gameplay, and has plenty of optional side-missions. They’ve improved and trimmed the AC formula to make gameplay better (however still has that “AC quirk” from the preceding games). The game introduces a new world and characters; this may either feel like a slog or a joy, depending on the new colonial American skin it has put on. For me, it felt like a slog at the beginning, then joy crept-up as the story evolved. The story carried me to finishing this game together with naval combat (yes, it’s that good). As for Desmond’s, let’s say that segment is starting to get old and unnecessary.

NOTE:
For Steam, you need to buy Assassin's Creed Odyssey Gold or Ultimate edition to play. You need to download and play AC Odyssey first for the AC III license to activate

Complaints in no particular order:

Says you only need an Ubisoft account but I had to install the Ubisoft U-play client.  Free-running (and in general the controls) are sometimes frustrating.  Menu interaction is not great a lot of the time and you have to move your hand off WASD or take your hand off the mouse.  Areas that seem like they're meant for climbing can't be climbed at all, but an area a few feet away is just fine.  Inventory management is unintuitive.  It does a poor job of helping you sometimes.  For example, both times I sent trade convoys they were attacked and it warns me that they were under attack but provided no info on how I might actually help defend them.  Other times it just doesn't explain things.  Liberation missions?  They're all over the map but what's the point really?  So blue-coat soldiers can attack you instead of red-coats?  Lots of crafting stuff is possible, it seems, but you'll amass a TON of recipes very early that are unusable because you don't have the materials and/or craftsmen.  Combat is okay but it's super annoying how troops sometimes seem to just continually spawn or warp in.  Combat on stairs is straight-up stupid.  Wasted a bunch of time collecting feathers then got curious about what the reward actually is... and it's a costume I have zero interest in ever using.  Makes me curious how many in-game objectives are basically only for completion's sake.

Lots of glitches / bugs in this game.  I've gotten stuck on terrain and had to fast-travel to get out of it.  I got sucked into a conversation once while the game continued on around me and I was beat to death while I listened to the NPC.  I had a fort captain disappear somehow and had to reset & clear the fort again.  Just now I quit because I didn't get credit for the story quest objective (kill a dude).  I've had a restricted area with no visible troops on the map or on my screen literally spawn a half-dozen soldiers once I stepped foot into the area.

It's not a horrible game but I wouldn't recommend PAYING for it, especially not for full price.  I got it as part of a bundle when I purchased AC: Odyssey.

Edit: One thing that really irritates me is how the game seems to randomly choke and stutter.  When it does this, the mouse input seems like it's multiplied.  A movement that might normally move the camera slightly instead swings it around wildly.

Edit 2: I am at the start of Sequence 8 (out of 12) and uninstalling this.  The story is trite and the cast seems to be comprised of a bunch of white pricks gas-lighting the PoC main character.  ""I know I was just shooting cannons at everyone and trying to kill them but really what I wanted to do was TALK.""  And we're supposed to accept it like the MC is just too hot under the collar?

The missions also have a lot of optional stuff that is just plain stupid -- like to get an air assassination off in an area that is basically flat land with no trees or buildings nearby.  I started doing homestead quests and then got bored of that.  The additional NPCs are boring as heck and I can't imagine the rewards are worthwhile.  It's just busy work to pad the play-time of the game.  Oh and the missions to level up your homestead is crap like, ""Now that we've disabled the fast-travel points, please run across the map, then back across the map, now run across it again.  Okay last time!  Done!""  Who designed this garbage?

Ran into more bugs where I didn't get credit for a quest and needed to reload THREE times.  Wth?  Ran into another bug where the fast-travel menus just didn't work even though the feature was enabled at the time.

I was going to just barrel through the main story to at least see the story to completion but this is NOT worth my time.  So-so gameplay and crap story plus numerous bugs?  I have better things to do with my time off.",1607484738,1607565268,False,8,0,0.582714438438415527,0,True,False,False

I chose to play through every single Assassins Creed game, and while doing so I dreaded the moment where i'd have to choose between buying this remaster or somehow getting my hands on the original. I had heard so much complaints about this remaster that I went into the game expecting an absolute bore of a story and an abysmal excuse for a remaster.

Boy was I wrong, kinda

[u] Music [/u]
The Ezio trilogy is known to have some of the best music and soundtracks in the entire Franchise, but i swear to god when i first opened the game and heard that theme is was blown away. Sure, its nothing compared to ""Earth"" or ""Ezios Family"" but boy is it awesome. The only musical downside for me is that the game seems to play the same song every single chace sequence, or when you alert an enemy. Also [spoiler] The song used when Connor is forced to kill Haytham [/spoiler] is Amazing

[u] Characters [/u]
Not much to say, Desmond is the same old Desmond, Achilles is a stereotypical old/wise man, Haytham is a complete Badass, and Connor is a child all the way through (If you aren't considering the unused dialogue at the end of the game). I think they could have used [spoiler] Daniel Cross [/spoiler] more during the modern day sections, considering how important he is to the history of both the Assassins and Templars.


[u] Story [/u]
Definitely not as good as the trilogy preceding it, but watching Connor meet familiar faces and struggle to hunt the man he blames for the burning of the village is pretty cool. I think if they matured Connor more, the story would have benefited greatly. The twits regarding [spoiler] Washington and Connor [/spoiler] is kinda Eh, and they seem to drop it entirely and focus more on Lee.

[u] Graphics [/u]
Clay faces of not, this remaster is beautiful, you'll miss the enhancements if you move directly onto black flag or rogue.

If you want a (Somewhat) satisfying conclusion to Desmond's story, buy it. If you're skeptical and would rather the newer more refined games, wait for a sale and get Odyssey and its season pass",1607514801,1607514801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, I quite like AC3. I haven't experienced the bugs and glitches to the extent that other reviews mention. In the 25 hours it took me to play, the game crashed one time and I only experienced a few bugs. The game was more stable than regular AC3 on my Xbox 360. While AC3 is one of my least favorite Assassin's Creeds, this is definitely the definitive version. One complaint about AC3 remastered is that while everything looks much better, everyone has that weird ""playstation face."" Everyone looks like their face is made of clay. I would give AC3 a 7.5/10 for the weak story and weak protagonist but good overall gameplay and sound.

Next, Tyranny of King Washington is very underwhelming. The reveal at the end is mildy interesting and it takes about 5.5 hours to finish, which is a good length for a DLC. However, the game is extremely frustrating at times. Unlike the game game, in TKW there's significant issues with locking on to targets and input seemingly not being received. Also, Connor will randomly stand in bushes while sneaking in the many instant-fail stealth missions. The game compensates for a lack of difficulty by putting an enormous number of enemies on every street corner. Fights aren't challenging, just long. 5.5/10.

Lastly, AC Liberation took a little over 9 hours to finish, having skipped some side quests. The game looks very impressive at times, especially in the Louisiana bayous. The story is very simple and easy to follow in the beginning, which is a nice change of pace for an AC game, however it becomes very convoluted and confusing in the last hour. The music is very hit or miss, with some songs being genuinely impressive and others sounding like they came straight out of a Mario game. In my opinion, ACL is one of the most underrated AC games and would definitely recommend buying AC3R just to play it, if you haven't already.

Assassin's Creed III is probably the most underrated game in the AC franchise. It's certainly not perfect, but if you like the mechanics of AC2 - AC: Syndicate, have an interest in US Historical fiction, and/or don't mind the jank of this old engine, then you will likely enjoy it.

Context: 
I originally played this on PS3 on release, received this for free when buying AC: Odyssey, and decided to revisit it...

Pros:
Great Story - I personally liked the characters and story. The prologue is a legendary hook. The game has lots of shameless American History ""fan service"", but they do a good job of inserting Ratonhnhaké:ton (Conor) into a lot of historical events without it being too ridiculous (except the Tyranny of King Washington DLC, that timeline is straight-up nonsense).

Setting - Assassin's Creed games always nail the aesthetic of their setting, and this entry is no different. Wandering around the frontier, leaping through the trees, and exploring early American cities around New England is incredibly fun and feels authentic (though I'm no history buff). 

New Mechanics - The guns were implemented well. They don't feel OP like I feared. Most of this is due to the fact that guns in this time period were very cumbersome and are only really good for a quick shot or two. The tree climbing is fantastic and a welcome addition. The hunting is also surprisingly fun despite being simplistic. 

Cons:
Glitchy... oh so glitchy... - This game has glitches everywhere from objects behaving weirdly to quests straight up breaking because certain things didn't spawn in.  It's almost impossible to run across a city or complete a story mission without encountering a significant glitch. The physics are unpredictable, the combat is janky, and Ratonhnhaké:ton's model CONSTANTLY misinterprets and straight up ignores player inputs leading to fatal free-running mishaps and failed combat encounters. 

Difficulty - I've played every Assassin's Creed game and this one so far is the hardest one, for all the wrong reasons. Enemies are cheap, bonus objectives are actually impossible in many cases, and the constant glitches can sabotage a flawless execution. My advice is to ignore the bonus objectives all-together and just enjoy the story and exploring the world. 

Neutral:
The Remaster - Subjectively I like the new graphics. Some people don't like the lighting or character textures, but I found them to be good (not great). I played through this on PS3 originally, and the remaster on top of the PC upgrade made a huge difference for me. The remaster does seem half-assed, with a lot of models, textures, and lighting in areas being missed. It's certainly not worth paying for the remaster since it does not make this game seem next-gen, but if you don't already have the original on PC, it's a welcome upgrade.",1607460718,1607460718,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

That's where the good stuff ends for me.

The music is so boring - one tune is used for basically every situation, and another one for roaming the city (consisting of only two heavy, annoying notes).

Gameplay is kinda okay, but it feels like a downgrade from Revelations. Kill animations are good, but the fights are very dull.

Story is probably the worst one I've ever played in a AAA title, definitely the worst in the AC series, for me at least.

Voice acting is laughable and audio mastering and the delay between a character saying something and somebody else reacting is pathetic.

I'm not too angry, I got the game for free by buying the epic AC: Odyssey, but as someone who has played most of the AC games (and currently on a run from 1 to Valhalla) I need to say I'm more than disappointed here. The ideas were okay I guess, but the execution is pathetic. Playing this game was like punishment for me. Could not finish it, came to sequence 9, closed the game and watched a recap.

If you're a masochist like me, forcing yourself to play through all the AC games, the AC III will be the ultimate pain in the ass for you, with completely scripted missions that make you follow the developer's path, not yours. Any, slightly creative approach is a ""desynchronization"". The fight is so boring and unsatisfying.
Omg, soldiers are like flies flying around your head, they're not even any threat, they won't leave any reward for fighting them. It's actually more efficient to let them fucking kill you, because otherwise you need to waste another 5 minutes to escape and hide!
Most of the times the game doesn't even tell you wtf it wants from you and leaves you with utterly stupid missions. They look like someone wanted to force diversity into them, but failed terribly.
And Connor is naive as fuck and have a stick stuck up his ass :)

There are positives of course. The plot is amusing, historical canvas is pretty interesting, the world and graphics are decent.

Assassin’s Creed III has a lot of scope and ambition, and while it feels like a true sequel to the Ezio trilogy, it fails to deliver in so many things. It does some things well. It has a fresh and bigger setting in Colonial America. It has 2 major cities, Boston and New York, and a big Frontier section to explore. It has a homestead that you gradually build and upgrade. Combat has slick animations, especially the double kills. It introduced the awesome naval battle mechanics that made Black Flag so successful. The soundtrack is good. The assassins that you can recruit are no longer generic, and while there are only 6, each is unique and has its own backstory. The story has a lot of teasing moments and explore the Templar side of things. It has tons of things to do for 100% completion.
However, it lacks in many things. The remaster itself is a bit ugly and removed some of the grey atmosphere of the original. Worse of all, it broke the combat counter mechanic. Lots of times the counter indicator comes too late or doesn’t appear at all, and that leads to frustrating combat, which is a core mechanic of the game. That didn’t happen on the original, but since I’m reviewing the remaster, this is a big minus. While the story and villains are interesting, the main assassin, Connor, is just uninteresting. Parkour was downgraded. The first quarter of the story feels like a long tutorial and features a better protagonist. Missions are scripted and rarely allow you some freedom. Plus, they have lots of dialogue in them. It concludes the Desmond storyline, and while the modern missions are not bad, they distract you from the main game.
It’s not a bad game, you can see it has a high production value, but lacks polish in some things. The remaster makes things worst, breaking combat which was one of the best parts of the game.  It also includes The Tyranny of King Washington DLC, which has a short but better story, and some new and cool mechanics. It has bad side content, but I really enjoyed it for the story.
About Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD, it’s what you expect from a watered-down portable version of Assassin’s Creed – a short and repetitive Assassin’s Creed. It has the first playable female assassin, but the story and characters are uninteresting. But it has surprisingly good combat for a handheld, almost as good as its big brother. And it has a cool swamp area, The Bayou, with tree climbing and canoe riding. Just think of Liberation as a standalone expansion for Assassin’s Creed III, it gets a bit better if you think about it that way.
Anyway, this package has good value, especially if you get it as part of the Assassin’s Creed Odyssey season pass. As a standalone title, it is worth a playthrough on sale if you’re an Assassin’s Creed fan. Otherwise, I recommend other, better Assassin’s Creed titles, like II, Brotherhood, IV Black Flag and Rogue.",1606079475,1606079475,True,13,2,0.622021913528442383,0,True,False,False

Assassin's Creed 3 is visually impressive, is well voice acted, obviously had an enormous budget in expectation of enormous earnings, but it all just seemed so ... silly. It's painful to look at such a huge investment of skill and resources and come to that conclusion, but that is the way the scale tipped in the end. Why? Because AC3 is more a melodramatic action movie than a game. And what would the billing of this action movie be? Forrest Gump as the Prince of Persia in Mel Gibson's the Patriot directed by Michael Bay. I just cannot recommend it, for the reasons below.

Connor is literally all over the map. There is not one major event of the Revolutionary War he is not in some way responsible for. Half way through I came to believe that the Animus is actually a daydream machine that is playing out some school boy's fantasy as his mind drifted away during history class. The formula is relentlessly repeated over and over. Some historical figure is ineffectively standing around hopelessly waiting for Connor. He approaches and the historical figure is either really nice to him (which he responds to with disdain) or they treat him like garbage (which makes him more determined to prove himself to the jerk). He charges off on some ""impossible"" task, which is actually really easy for an Assassin to accomplish. So, Connor has to make up some laughably inefficient way to pull it off (these are called ""optional objectives"" and they are the only thing that add any challenge to the missions). 

If it is a boss mission, it ends with some overly long monologue from a dying villain who, for some reason, always attempts to gaslight Connor with stunningly bad sophistry, which is completely pointless because we have all seen the atrocities Connor has suffered at the hands of these people. Connor then goes home and argues with the old man who lives in his house. Over and over and over.

What elements of game play exist have been ruthlessly butchered to fit into the director's vision for this melodrama. The missions are scenes in the movie. The player is a keyboard stuntman off camera. Your job is to learn the script in real time, and trigger Connor's stunts at just the right moment. If you screw up, Connor gets teleported back in time about 10 - 30 seconds so you can try again.  Some mission segments are so linear, hyper-stylized, and choreographed that they might as well just be a cutscene, then you could at least enjoy the chaotic grandeur of fire, gunshots, and explosions Connor is running through but that you have no time to appreciate because you are trying to figure out the next stunt the director wants you to execute without knowing the script.

The fighting system relies on the worst movie trope for action films: bad guys always surround the hero and attack one by one, giving the hero a chance to kill each one in order while the rest wait for their turn to be murdered. Little lights go on above their head so that you know which one is going to attack and you can press the right key to get Connor to do his choreographed fight move. Don't try to speed up the process out of boredom. You are going to have to sit and watch 9 guards get slaughtered sequentially with various fighting moves that are all triggered the same way, otherwise they will land a hit and interrupt the choreography, slowing down the process even more. 

Just accept what you are! An afterthought. As if someone had to keep reminding the developers - you do know this is a game right, not a movie? Oh right - well, have the player push E really fast after 3 minutes of exposition, that will count as gameplay, right?

In between missions, you can take Connor out on a tour through the country and the city. The game makers have given you this nice little pointless sandbox that it is unnecessary to participate in to complete the game, but is one heck of a time waster. Let's get the Assassin to climb into a tree to collect eagle feathers! The reason people bought this game was to watch some guy climb clones of the same tree over and over, right? 

Well, maybe he should go hunting instead? This too is a silly distraction. The animals don't path very well, so hunting them stealthily or with traps is just a waste of time. Just chase them briefly until they bump into something and then stab them. And some zones are so thick with animals that you will only be able to walk a few steps between them. At one point, I was taking Connor out for a walk on a path, where he was sequentially attacked by 6 bobcats in about 2 minutes. They were lined up in a row of carcasses on the path. I started out by skinning them, but after #4 I started to get worried I was stuck in some infinite loop of bobcat attacks. 

And then it occurred to me - Desmond's objective is to learn by reliving the life (or fantasy life) of his ancestor. Does he really have any motivation to waste his life climbing dream trees, slaughtering digital wildlife with retractable assassin blades, or organizing trade caravans of flowers? I mean, we are the players after all, not him.",1603512733,1603512733,False,8,0,0.498608589172363281,0,True,False,False

It’s quite different from past games in both of those regards and whilst it’s definitely an enjoyable experience, it’s also an incredibly buggy one that sometimes became a drag to get through.

[h1]What I like:[/h1]

+ As is usual with Assassin’s Creed, the environments in this game are fantastic. However, Assassin’s Creed 3 takes it to the next level. There are three main areas you can explore; Boston, New York and the Frontier, the latter being a forest environment. All three of these are massive areas, packed with detail, and the remaster helps tremendously with bringing these locations to life.

+ While it definitely stumbles with pacing, the story is pretty good. Set during the American Revolution, for the majority of the game you play as a native, Connor, and experience his journey on becoming an assassin. While it takes a while to set off, AC3’s story is entertaining, and sets itself apart from past games.

+ The characters, whilst nowhere near the same quality as characters in previous games, are memorable and well written. The main characters, Haytham and Connor are definitely the strongest of the bunch, and while it definitely takes time to like Connor, he gets better as he matures and develops. 

+ It’s safe to say that the combat in AC3 is the best the combat has ever been in the franchise up to this point. From both a visual and a gameplay standpoint, the combat is fluid and incredibly satisfying. The new weapons, with the exception of the bow, are all entertaining to use and vary the combat up greatly. 

+ The soundtrack is another aspect that deserves praise. Despite not being as remarkable as past games, the music and ambient sounds do a good job at setting the mood for the game. The voice acting is also very good, especially for the main characters.

+ The modern-day sections in AC3 have been the best so far. While there are a couple of hick ups, the modern-day story line is the most productive the series has had. You learn a lot more about the people who came before, and the conclusion is a good set up for the next chapter of the franchise.     
 
[h1]What I don’t like:[/h1]

- Assassin’s Creed 3 is quite a buggy experience. Considering this is a remaster, you’d think bugs wouldn’t be much of a problem, right? I wish. Some of the most annoying bugs however, happen when you are climbing, whether it be your character just decides to jump to his death, not move at all, not being able to do a simple climb or just ignoring your every command. 

- As I mentioned before, there are pacing issues in the story especially with the introduction of Connor. This part of the game was a massive drag, and felt like the equivalent of watching paint dry. Other parts of the game are either too fast or just boring altogether. Luckily the last third of the game doesn’t have this issue.

- Another big issue with this remaster is the character models. The lighting works really well on the environments, but completely destroys itself with the characters. They either look like wax dolls or crack heads. The modern-day characters in particular, look absurd.  

- Going back to bugs, there’s plenty to choose from; Attacks not working properly, camera not moving at all, bow not firing arrows, repeating music tracks, music not working, cutscenes not playing, character models flying around after death, enemies forgetting you exist when you jump into a bush, your horse not coming to you when you want him to, not being able to climb a tree or slightly touch a fire and die instantly. I could go on, it’s honestly awful. 

[h1]My Overall Thoughts:[/h1] 

Assassin’s Creed 3 is definitely an ambitious title. It introduces many new elements to the series that set the franchise as a whole in a new direction. It’s a game that, despite its issues, is worth the time and investment. 

Does it have as strong a narrative as Ezio’s games? Nope. Does it stand strong on its own? Absolutely. While I did find Connor annoying, as time went on, he got better, similar to how I felt with Altair. The gameplay however is a definite step up, with a level of refinement that was much needed for the franchise.

This is, however, one of, if not the buggiest Ubisoft game I have ever played, and considering that this is a remaster, it shouldn't be. The bugs hamper almost every aspect of the game, with the ugly character models being the cherry on top.

As a sequel to Revelations, this game is a success. It picks up where it left off and tells a memorable and entertaining story. As a remaster? Try again Ubisoft.  

[h1]My Final Rating:[/h1]

A couple segments of the game take place during the winter season & the environments are absolutely beautiful. The main protagonist Connor is a brooding no nonsense type of guy that tells it like it is.

It doesn't help that much of the game takes place in the wild and the free running and climbing there feels much worse than the last one.  The MC is stiff, wooden, boring, etc. I know they probably wanted to go the opposite direction than Ezio but having the MC on Ambien doesn't make for an engaging story. Takes about 8 hours to get out of the tutorial section and the world to finally open up. I feel the start with the Assassin turned Templar opening bit, is a complete waste of time and the game should have started around sequence 5 or 6. Loads more of the Assassin and Templar bs, I know it’s called Assassin's Creed but the Assassin and Templar power battle, to me, is the least interesting parts of these games. All in all, not as good as AC II and its sequels or most of the games that came after it, but better than the first one.

Eventually thought I started to get more interested in US History so playing something that would immerse me in the Revolutionary War period became very appealing.

I was pleasantly surprised by how well the core components of the game hold up to modern standards, although that may speak more to the lack of gameplay innovation in the industry than anything else. In fact, there are several aspects in this game that you could consider better than later AC games, like lip syncing, social stealth, and free-running. 

Visually, with the slight improvements from the remaster, the game holds up very well and performance was not an issue at 1080p with a GTX 1070, which gave me steady 60+ FPS. I wish they would have included more graphics options though. Boston, New York, and the Frontier are alive, active, and display why Ubisoft is a top tier creator of immersive environments. 

As with most AC games, I recommend playing them to those particularly interested in the historical tourism aspect, but from a gameplay perspective there wasn't enough to keep me engaged after completing the main missions and none of the side content really pulled me in. We're past the point where open world games can simply put a marker on my map to draw my attention to that content, especially since side content isn't necessary in this game to continue through the main missions.

I personally don't understand why. For background, I played AC Origins as my first AC game earlier this summer, and have since played the Ezio Trilogy as well. This being my 5th AC game, I have some point of reference. I would say that the graphics and mechanics are a significant step up from Ezio trilogy, and there is more variation in weapons. The maps are also much more varied and colorful making the open world more immersive. Currently in sequence 9/12, I have thoroughly enjoyed the story and have found the templars more compelling that any that Ezio faced off against. The downsides: It is true that connor is incredibly boring compared to Ezio. Also the music is nowhere near as great as the background music in the Ezio trilogy. That being said, I have still enjoyed this game a lot, and the variation in different parts of the map (i.e cities, vs fronteir vs homestead) as well as variation in missions (Homestead missions, naval combat, liberation missions, etc.) are probably better than any other AC game I have played, origins included. Origins obviously has far more quests, but they are all one-off and lack the feeling of progress you get from completing liberation, homestead and naval missions. Overall I would Rank this just below Origins, tied with Revelations (which was my favorite of the Ezio trilogy due to Old Ezio and a fantastic story), and slightly ahead of 2 and brotherhood. Brotherhood had good side content but all of the side content in AC 3 is a significant step up. If you can just get over the fact that connor really does suck as a character, then this game is so much fun.

Edit: This game comes with AC Liberation and is totally skippable, in fact I highly recommend you just skip it and spend your time playing much better games or doing something else entirely. I played through 3 of the 9 sequences and the ""story"" just feels like a random compilation of really uninteresting missions with no overarching plot. The open world, which is one of the reasons I have gotten so into Assassin's creed games lately, is so dull and lifeless, which I guess isn't shocking since it is a PSvita game. Again, I don't have super high standards for open world content (really enjoyed the ezio trilogy) but this open world is worse without any of the redeeming qualities the ezio game had. No real side content besides collectibles and I'm not a completionist so I don't care about gathering diary pages. Play AC3 and maybe the Tyranny of King Washington (I know many people love it, I kinda hated it).",1598978533,1600393233,True,8,2,0.569462716579437256,0,True,False,False

Cons:
Gameplay is still clunky, buggy, and unpolished.
Story is okay but it feels like cut-off.
Graphics looks like the same thing with higher resolution.
Stupid forced minigames for simplest things.

Pros:
I can't think a single thing. Maybe the modern day story is okay.

The game still holds the crown for worst Assassin's Creed game ever.


The game also contains AC: Liberation. Game is not too bad if you look at it as a PS:Vita game but for a PC game it definitely isn't worth playtime.

Cons:

Story is bad and slow.

Controls are worse than AC3. You can't really free roam because wherever you try to climb, the game simply tells you ""No, I don't want you to go from there. I want you to go from the spesific point I put for you"" and I'm not even talking about in missions. I'm talking about ""FREE"" roam.

Game also contains gazillion of different collectibles with no map to look for them. You can only see them on your minimap if you're close to them. I went for every single thing I saw on the minimap and only managed to complete one set and it gave me the almost exact hat she wears as default on Assassin persona.

Pros:
Persona system is nice at first. Every persona has its own strengths and weaknesses but since you can only change them in spesific spots, you almost never bother.

Assassin persona has a chain system (holding R) which looks nice but pretty luckluster in actual gameplay.

Slave persona can blend in with other slaves without drawing too much attention and it's probably my favorite persona since its weaknesses are not too bad (Low hp and no sword but you can still carry small weapon)

I guess if it was a cannon game, these would be much better so that's why I put them in pros even though they aren't perfect.",1598387091,1599852456,False,2,1,0.428571432828903198,0,True,True,False

Since this is an old game I didn't mind the bad mobility, combat and graphics glitches. There were plenty of other annoyances. For one example there are plenty of ramp-like wagons followed up with poles at the sides of the buildings. Any AC played would go there when chasing someone to take the higher ground. But they rarely lead anywhere, at some quests you even start right next to them. But they go off to a completely different direction than the quest objective. Another example is that after each mission you have a 15 second long time where you cannot see the minimap or anything else because its going through the ""synchronization percentage"". You can press a button to get into a menu to see more information about it and then exit it, but the animations in the menus takes forever to complete as well so you might as well just wait it out.

The reason I played through this was because of the story, and boy was I disappointed. The dialogues are very weird and far from how people would actually react to what you're saying to them.

This feels like a dishonest, greedy cash-grab on Ubisoft's part. Want to play AC3 again, only this time in 4k? Pony up $100 extra then, because AC: Odyssey is $60 and the Season Pass is another $40 on top of that without any discounts simply because Ubisoft wants to shove AC: Odyssey down your throat. I haven't actually contacted Ubisoft about this as I do in fact have Odyssey (haven't played it yet because I'm still working on AC: Origins), but I've read online that if you contact Ubisoft to complain and ask for a fix, they'll tell you to go buy AC: Odyssey. Shady AF. People shouldn't be forced to buy an extra game AND that extra game's DLC in order to play a game they THOUGHT they purchased already.

The game itself (I played it on PS3 when it first came out) is pretty good. Not the best in the series, but taking a stroll through American history and being able to take part in the Revolutionary War and the events that led up to it is certainly interesting and makes the game worth it (though NOT worth the $100 USD extra unless you're already planning to buy AC: Odyssey as well as its Season Pass), even if Connor is a bit shallow/bland for a main character.

I can't speak to the ""remastered"" part of this game as of yet, as I haven't even been able to get past the damn activation code bit, but once I do I'll compare it to what I remember on the PS3 and will update this review to reflect the graphics and any other ""remastered"" content.

Ubisoft, if you ever read this (which I doubt), what you did in locking this game behind Assassin's Creed: Odyssey and forcing people to shell out even more money to buy a game they may not be interested in just to play a game they already legally purchased is shady, greedy, dishonest and downright wrong.

Steam doesn't give you those keys for this game and so I did some research and found that you have to run Odyssey first to get it to work.
I think this is a gross oversight for people who have a limited amount of space on their computers for games and people who don't have a very fast internet connection. Odyssey is a 90 GB GAME It would take a couple days for me to download it and quite frankly, I don't feel like I should have to run one game in order to play a second one.",1598329395,1598329395,False,80,12,0.802270948886871338,0,True,False,False

Take, for example, The Ezio's trilogy, a coming of age story that takes its time to flourish and develop at a considerable pace through three games, it makes you appreciate the character of Ezio at every stage of his life, meanwhile, AC III tried to cramped everything it can into a single game that goes even beyond a single character. It has you start with Haytham, the Templar father, and then immediately follow his son Connor as he goes from a child, a teenager to eventually an adult, and an assassin master.

Because of the condensed story, it takes over half of the game to “properly” start doing the exciting assassin stuff, the first half was more like a grand tutorial that shows you around, always holding you back on going full explorer and roam around as the story does matter, and even when you make it to the second half the plot is already complicated and more involved, so many characters and players steering the wheel and more often than not the narrative gets lost and bounces around aimlessly.

In terms of the visuals, the game is stunning looking, giving even some recent games a challenge, but I should probably note that I played through the remastered version, and remastered it was. The environment is so dynamic with the night/day, weather, and seasonal cycles that alter all locations to a degree of not recognition. The open world is vast which multiple locations, Boston, New York, and the Frontier, all very unique and have different aspects to them.
Before this, Monteriggioni was my favorite hideout in the franchise, it felt alive, spacious and a safe sandbox for Ezio to chill around in peace, but now that I've experienced Homestead, that would be hard to top. The location is even more spacious, it feels even more alive with more people and animals that inhabit the area, to a degree that every resident has their own dedicated, daily routing depending on their profession, like seriously, I took my time in the game stalking each one of them and observing as they go about their unique daily tasks than to transition in between work breaks and go fishing or hunting to head the sack by the end of the day, only to wake up and do the same thing the next day which a slightly different schedule and activities, I mean, the game is proud enough with this feature that it encourages you to inspect several activities that the resident can do and rewards you with achievement, and even that does cover all that they can do.

The control scheme has seen a complete overhaul to the point I was completely overwhelmed and lost having gotten used to the old control scheme, but after training my muscle memory on this one's, I don't see myself going back. The combat was a major part of the fun that this game provides, it's an entirely new system put into place, it's so fluid, the animations are amazing and it plays very fast but less forgiving than the past games.
This was clearly, very ambitious project, really achievement new records to be broken in the franchise in terms of how to open-world it is. There is just so much to do in the world aside from the story, so much so that I finished the entirety of the Canon missions and my save file was still at  44% of completion rate, I've only managed to 100% finish the game after a slow 2 months with over 92 hours, including all DLC.

All in all, the game really suffered from the fast-paced nature of the storytelling, something that really hurt the character of Connor. While a good character, it did not resonate the same way as Altair and Ezio did.
This was probably the game that gets the most hate in the entire old gen franchise, however, now that I've played it, although years after release, it was a genuinely good game, even if it did not live up to the standards that the Ezio trilogy achievement in terms of storytelling, it seems that the game prioritized the open-world over its story, I mean, they were half right to do so. A story will eventually wrap up, but the replayability of the game can be infinite some would say, but that can't be without sacrificing the aspect of a good and memorable protagonist.",1598172818,1598172818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I give this a thumbs up because it was absolutely amazing when it came out but this remaster doesn't even do it justice.  I have to agree with Smackm0nk3y and say that it does seem quite boring now.

The fighting is great and was a step up from the older ones , and even the story is okay (just a little slow paced though to keep my interest). 

The real problem is the overwhelming tasks to do that just become too much of a chore than actually being fun. 

The other reason I gave it a thumbs up is because if you are a die hard fan and want the history and lore for the rest of your collection then you just need to get it because of how it ties a whole lot of things together with the characters and connections to other characters leading up to the present. I mean there are a lot of things I understand better now after going back and playing again and if you're a die hard fan then you will really appreciate it as I did.

Or to be more precise, better than I remember. When I was a kid I couldn't stand the beginning because it took 4 hours before you could even play as the actual main character Connor, instead you play as his father Haytham. Having a better appreciation for the AC lore and story now, I can see why playing as Haytham was vital in setting the game up this way. Not to mention all the modern day parallels with Desmond reuniting with HIS father, William. Their friction kind of mirrors the kind Connor and Haytham face in the Animus's history simulation. [spoiler] And while I already know that Haytham is a Templar, I can see how shocking it must have been for everyone to play the intro sequence and find out that he was a Templar after doing so much good with freeing Indian slaves.[/spoiler]

Now onto the gameplay. This is the smoothest experience AC must have had, it had a perfect mix of new and old mechanics but streamlined. For instance holding Legs for Fast Walk automatically makes you push people aside instead of making you accidentally pickpocket them when your intention was to blend into the crowd. Now you hold Free Hand to pickpocket and that's the way it should have always been as it was in AC1. Furthermore, simply holding High Profile lets you free run on even surfaces instead of always having to hold Legs in order to jump so that makes it more smooth to play. Not to mention the Manual Side Hops are in this game so it's nice to have that freedom of expression in parkour, especially with Back Ejects that still let you get more verticality from each successive jump. It's just a shame that the setting doesn't allow for much verticality since the emphasis is now on horizontal movement through tree jumping.

This combat style is also a huge improvement from always having to hold Target AND Block in order to anticipate an attack you can counter. Whenever you're in open conflict, you will automatically target the nearest foe and you can no longer hold block, instead you have to time your counters. Very good options to because you can use enemies as human shields to protect you from gun shots and the Kill Streak mechanic introduced from Brotherhood makes its return, except this time you can't buffer your next kill as early as you used to. Instead you have to time it after a kill. Also ACIII introduced multi counter kills, so when two enemies attack you at once, you can kill them both at once and that makes for awesome combat.

The STEALTH in this game is also a huge improvement with Wall Hugging that is very loose and free to use, along with using tall grass and bushes. This makes for a more authentic stealth experience than previous AC installments where you're always just standing around and awkwardly standing by wall corners fidgeting with the camera to get a view. The wall hug is more immersive and functional. The stealth kill animations are also new and improved compared to previous games. They look more realistic and brutal instead of just clunky and mere functional like they were in the first four games of the series.

All in all this makes for an epic conclusion to the original trilogy, even though what they did to Desmond's character at the end was probably the beginning of the end for the entire franchise. As a side note, if you've read my other reviews regarding HUD-less gameplay, this is by far the best game to play it that way as it now features on screen icons that indicate your destination, and the map works properly where it shows the direction you're facing without having to have the mini-map on. I swear that's a dumb glitch that somehow made it to Brotherhood AND Revelations, glad it's fixed now. Plus the HUD elements actually look slick and clean for once instead of awkward futuristic icons that clash with the historic setting. Now they look like a good juxtaposition to remind you its just a simulation. Too bad I play without it though lol.

Anyways highly recommend as this is mechanically the best Assassin's Creed game, at least in the original trilogy.

Unlike 3, Liberation has a more interesting main character I can actually identify with, and brings some fun new twists to the franchise - for example, 3 personas you can switch between (assassin, fine lady, or disguised as a slave) each with different capabilities and limitations.

New Orleans and the Bayou are visually very cool too. And the trade system is FAR easier that in AC3.

There are still some frustrations, like in some memories you can't switch personas freely, and there is no fast travel except to and from the Bayou (and I suppose NY, though I haven't progressed that far yet). 

Below is my original review for just AC3 Remastered, with an added note at the top.

========================

=caveat, the review below was written after completing the very darn frustrating final chase. I still think it's a weak entry in the AC franchise, though and would still not recommend it unless you are a freak for completion like me=

So, playing this game is =definitely= better than getting your eye poked out with a sharp stick. Not much better, mind you, but I would probably choose playing it over losing an eye. Depending on which eye.

Before playing this, I played AC 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations, and then Odyssey.

The whole Ezio saga was THE BEST video game saga I had ever played. I doubt now that it will ever be equaled. And playing Kassandra in AC: Odyssey was breathtakingly beautiful and fulfilling.

AC 3: Remastered? I wanted to love it, but in the end I merely suffered through it with grim determination to complete it. I have never been less interested in getting 100% sync. Thank god it is over.

The crafting and trade mechanics are tedious. The historical period actually =less= interesting after having played the game. I can't pinpoint all the ways it failed, but for me at least, it did.

-Visual improvements overall
-Gameplay changes like lockpicking of Chests got removed.
-Story, AC3's has one of my favorite main stories of the series
-Changes to UI elements to make it more akin to Black Flag and Rogue.

Con:
-I find Tyranny of King Washington to be one of the worst Story DLC's of the Series. It's not a continuation of the main story as it's more of a ""What If"" Situation.

The game was really good in terms of gameplay but I felt like the story was lacking. 
The game had a few problems.
The probably most obvious thing is that the faces look pretty damn bad, especially in cutsceens. I am not sure how it happened but somehow they managed to make them look worse then they looked in the original Assassin's Creed ||| but it happened. Although I have to say you kinda get used to the faces looking like they do but that could also just be because I never played the original and have only seen the comparison videos on YouTube.
I also didn't like that sometimes subtitles would show up even though I disabled them. I can understand when they show up when characters speak in another language which did happen a lot during the earlier sequences, which didn't really make sense since the Animus is supposed to translate everything. The problem is that they also showed up when characters spoke English which sometimes kept me from taking screenshots but honestly that's just a nitpick.
They also kinda dumped down the parkour. The high-profile and free run/sprint button were merged which makes movement feel weird since you don't go into a jog like you did in the previous games but in a full on sprint as soon as you go into high-profile. It also interfered with parkour a bit, sometimes Connor would just run up a wall when I moved to close to it and when I was on something like for example a beam and tried to jump to another one Connor would just run up the wall the beam is a part of. The parkour is also way too safe, there is no real danger anymore since you will only be able to jump when the jump is safe. I don't like how they turned the parkour from a big gameplay element and a way to get around into just a way to get around. It did look pretty smooth and I liked that you could now free run in trees but that wasn't enough to make up for the negatives.

Connor as a character had a lot of potential, I thought he could be really cool but he never developed, he never learned from his mistakes, he just stayed naive. Most Templars in the story actually had good intentions so I never felt satisfied killing them (except for two). He also for some pronounces his ""native name"" different from everyone else, so either he doesn't know his own name or all the others are assholes (including his mother). His voice was also incredible monotone and he just sounded boring (especially noticeable during the side content). Connor was overall a really disappointing main character that stood in the shadow of the best character in the story, Haytham. Haytham was a really good and interesting character. I loved playing as him for the first three sequences and the parts where he returns were the best of the entire story. The story was also really disappointing, especially after the previous 4 games., it was just way to focused on the war which was a bit annoying. The modern day felt a bit too much like the ancestor story and the ending felt incredibly rushed. I was really disappointed at how they decided to end this story.
Combat was pretty good actually I really liked it. At the beginning of the game I thought it was a bit weird but after I got used to it I had a lot of fun using it. I loved the different tool like the rope darts and so on. The weapon variety was also really cool, i especially loved the Tomahawks. The combat could also get challenging when you fought against too many enemies.
The game also had a really beautiful world. The Cities were really nice to just walk through and looked beautiful and there was also the frontier which was amazing. The biggest problem I had with the world were the viewpoints, they all kinda were the same and in the frontier you have viewpoints on top of trees which are incredibly annoying and weird to reach. Fast travel was also really cool since they used a more fleshed out version of the tunnels. You can now explore them to unlock new locations to fast travel to. Exploring the tunnels was a lot of fun and I like the kinda spooky and creepy vibe they had.
The Recruitment system also returned but it wasn't as good as it was in Brotherhood or Revelations. What I liked though was that the recruits now felt a bit more important then  they did before since you now actually had a real mission that introduced them that was led up to by the liberation missions.
The liberation missions were fun and there was a good variety in the actual missions.
Collectibles in the game were also really cool. I liked collecting them all, especially the peg leg trinkets since they led up to a cool little quest line. The peg leg missions had probably the best setpieces in the game.
Frontiersmen missions were alright but nothing special and the Hunting Society hunts were unique but in the end didn't really give you anything special. The hunting system was pretty cool though and you can earn quite a lot of money with it. Assassination missions didn't really have any context around them and were just go there and kill that guy and didn't really feel important at all. Same for the letter missions, they didn't really do anything but add playtime and have you run around the cities/frontier. The best side content were the Homestead missions in my opinion. I loved seeing the village and the relationships between the people develop, they were really wholesome and the ending of them actually made me feel for Connor.
Naval also had a small part in the main story and had a few mayor side quests. I don't really like it but I also don't hate it. The controls felt a bit clunky at times but were alright.
There was also the Crafting and Trading system which didn't really feel fleshed out enough, they never really explained it to you in the story that much and it didn't play a huge role for me even after I finished the game since I never had any money problems. The crafting system did offer a few really nice upgrades though, like the dual pistol belt and the few weapons and consumable expansions you can craft.

Overall the game was alright. In terms of story the game was really disappointing but I really enjoyed the gameplay. I would say this game is worth it.",1594397639,1594397639,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

[b]Assassin's Creed III[/b]: 6.5/10

AC3's mediocre reception only put me off continuing the series for 8 flipping years.

It really wasn't bad -- perhaps even better than the mediocre Revelations, which had left a sour taste in my mouth back in 2012.

It's problems, however, are many: This is an amazingly ambitious game for 2012 -- and a mess. A bloated, trashy, buggy mess.

I don't want to write a detailed review, but something about the writing of this series sticks with me that I need to get it out: It's a trashy remnant from the influence of Lost and the Da Vinci Code, both still hugely popular around the start of the first game's development cycle. It's not good -- there is no well-written, deep, complex story to these games, only cheese and pulp and melodrama. Because there's *so much*, though, there are a bunch of small moments that are exceptional, but those welcome moments are always fleeting.

I mean, how do you juxtapose the father-son relationship between Connor and Haytham to Connor's 2-dimensional hunt for Charles Lee. Not to mention all the moments of narrative dissonance -- far too many in this game!! -- where gameplay and cutscenes don't line up at all. (The baffling prison segment is probably the worst offender here.)

Connor's not the most interesting protagonist, either, despite the potential being there. Social justice issues with a historical bent are central to AC3, but they're beaten to a pulp in their handling (with, again, fleeting 'wow' moments).

& good lord, the bugs! SO MANY BUGS. The developers seem to've spent so much time shoving every single possible idea into the game that they accidentally gut the QA/QC budget. What's the point of exploring a fully detailed American frontier if there's still nothing to do and all the collectables and upgrades are more trouble than they're worth?

First time I went out of my way to, er, not go out of my way for side content. Bulldozed the story (~17 hours) and didn't find the other content worth exploring.

Thank goodness they finally ditched Desmond. I was not expecting that. I thought the modern-day stuff would have been building towards him as a hero, but nope.

[b]The Tyranny of King Washington[/b]: 3/10

Absolutely atrocious. Buggier than the base game, somehow.

The gameplay increasingly revolves around and relies upon new supernatural animal powers Connor gets from drinking mystical Native American herbal tea*, and, surprise, none of those powers really work well and are broken in a number of fundamental ways. The original game tackles a lot of sincerely difficult issues, even if it does so mostly in a fluffy, action-movie way -- and then this comes over and just drops a smelly deuce all over that by throwing one offensive trope after another at the player. Yikes.

The missions are frustratingly repetitive and bland; you'll frequently get hung up on a buggy spot that causes you to die a handful of times not for any reason of challenge, but rather because the controls would lose their shit and hurl you into the wrong direction.

The whole Washington-becomes-corrupted-alternate-history approach makes so little sense and has no bearing on the overarching plot that it just feels like a waste of time. I feel like I'm accomplishing nothing for the 5.5 hours it takes to complete this broken mess of an expansion, and I hate it. I just hate this game. It made me genuinely like the base game less.

-----
[b]Liberation[/b]: 6.5/10

Liberation is impressive for a 2012 handheld game -- although I never owned a PSP, it's hard to wrap my head around this level of detail and single-player experience being around on a pocket system. x_x

A few wonderful bright spots that made me happy I gave my time to Liberation on my AC journey:
1. New Orleans is an interesting, well-designed locale, and the time period is fascinating.
2. Avelline rules. I know she isn't written particularly well -- leagues above Connor, but that's not saying much -- but I loved her character and genuinely enjoyed playing as her.
3. No trademark Ubisoft bloat. Just a straight campaign, no fuss. Please do this more often. I do not give a hoot about collecting boondoggles.

Most everything else doesn't work too well:
. The gameplay is finicky a la AC III, but the level design not overcrowded with twigs to get stuck on in the same way. The bayou sections dip into this, but not severely and not too often.
. The writing is as iffy as any AC game, but I give it credit for not getting too far up its own bottom in the same way III did. The denouement is ghastly, though. In fact, the last 4 (of 9) chapters feel rushed and incomplete -- their total length combined is about the same as any single one of the first 4 chapters.The twists are idiotic-slash-nonsensical.
. The mission design is draining -- the entire game is cut-and-paste one of 4 or 5 mission types repeated. Trail this guy; kill those guards without being detected; run over here in a time limit. It's not good. It's most similar to the original AC in its blandness. (I appreciate how easy the targets are, though -- they are not overly beefy with infinite healthbars as Connor's targets were. They just die in a hit or two like any normal human. That's a bit refreshing, tbh.) Yawn.

Good thing it's only 8 hours. Still, I had an OK time with it. I'm glad I played it, but also glad I got it out of the way and can move on to the newer titles. The bad reputations of this and III had put my AC journey on hold for 8 flippin' years, and only now do I feel like I can catch up. :)

I'll miss Avelline, though! I'm sick and tired of brooding manly men being either overly testosterone-y or faux-philosophical in these games.",1594302450,1594302477,False,19,2,0.58493417501449585,0,True,False,False

- Very interesting time period and lore
- Interesting characters and story
- Nice scenery. The cities are very nice and take you back to another time.
- Naval missions are pretty nice
- Graphics are pretty good considering the age of this game
- Nice melee moves, interesting choice in weapons

The bad:
- As an assassin going stealth in this game is insanely hard. Often it rewards more to just charge in and smash some skulls.
- Characters are not given much story and thus feel a bit bland.
- Remaster didn't do much for this game: Didn't solve bugs or glitchy mechanics, didn't improve graphics. In fact it made them worse in plenty of cases.

I don't now why they call it remastered as from what I saw the same bugs still exist as in the old version and some were added. 

For a big part I liked the main story but the dumbness compared to the clever schemes of Connor makes him very unbelievable as the hero.
The DLC the Tyranny of king Washington I started but that was just so bad I couldn't I stopped playing it

Then there's the side missions. I liked libearating the townparts which will grant you an apprentice with an unique skill you can use as of then. I liked the townquests which builds up a settlement and upgrades your craftesmen. The crafting/trading linked to it doesnt make sense however. There's hardly anything worth crafting, or buying in shops for that matter. So there's not really a need for money which makes the trading completely obsolete. 

You also get a ship and can do seabattles and apparently some missions. I've done some seabattles and they are just horrific. I guess this was the first failed try on them and they only managed to get it right in AC Black flag.

When fighting wild beast you die as the buttons you have to push to avoid or kill them during the fight don't work (and it's not cause I was too late). If you fight the human enemies it's all too easy if you know the button for the counterattack. Doesn't matter if 5 ppl aim at you from a distance with a gun, that loses less health than someone in mellee punching you once.

Lastly there's the menu and where to find all information. It is very unclear and scattered behind various options. Some things in the map menu, some things in the DNA, some in specific option like the assassins recruit menu.

*WARNING: contains spoilers!*
~ A remaster that looks worse than the AC games before it ~ (Well done Ubisoft)
Another long time fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise. 
Coming down with THE WORST game in the Assassin's Creed franchise and possible my entire game library. 
I can say for sure that this was pure agony to play through.. Especially if you're seeking 100% sync. This is my experience and my personal opinion of the agony I had to experience in this game so let me explain in detail:

~BUGS.. 
This game is extremely buggy, you can get stuck just about anywhere, a tree, an NPC, between objects and not to mention other bugs like: disappearing audio anywhere ; graphical glitches (light flickering, random flashing light in cutscenes, stretching artifacts) ; poor optimization in areas ; UI makes the objectives disappear therefore you can't see your mission ; Some of the player actions (sword swings, firearm shots) do not execute ; AI can see you anywhere ; AI can shoot through walls ; quick time events will instantly disappear for no reason ; random crashes ; animals spawning inside wagons ; if you will use stealth assassination then everyone will hear no matter what unless you're right next to them to shove that blade up their a*s ; AI does not react to alarms or other events ; You can bug cutscenes and move in them ; Forts will have randomly doors that wont open no matter what ; Lag spikes randomly occurring ; 
This is only the first 20 hours.. 
But wait, there's more !
Horses getting stuck in random open spots ; missions like the 7th sequence first quest, giving false directions into the river while being next to the objective ; Shop UI bug of crate clipping through all the times you look at when buying ; can't complete no detection assassination 7th sequence boss ; some AI enemies do not continue their routine after interruption ; unpolished map in which there are unconnected bushes meaning you can stand up and get noticed even tho you thought you're in the bush ; Juno unfinished cutcenes (like parts disappearing off her body and instead showing extremely creepy and disgusting character instead of Juno really looks like most of the time ; Falling through the map and dying ; AI attacking without being able to dodge them ; And many more that I'm sure I've forgot to mention
This is all the bugs I experienced in my playthrough.

~PARKOUR: The parkour is just so bad.. I mean a lot of the time it will be your own enemy because you just jump to places that you don't want to and therefore get caught or die accidentally.. So basically, you will not be able to climb things, as there are random walls everywhere and the targeting of objects is absurd. I died so many times because of me trying to do leap of faith and the character not executing my actions.. So basically it's extremely not responsive and extremely poorly made.

~STORY: The story is so f**king bland and boring.. I can hardly listen to anybody talking about anything and half of the time needing to actually read subtitles (In which btw, is also bugged as some of the subtitles are either way too fast or way too slow). I mean seriously the first few hours of the game is just so uninteresting.. You go between characters for such a long time till you finally get to the main character.. I mean I never played this before hand and I was so confused for hours on who am I playing with. And now after beating through the entire game. I can finally say that whoever wrote the entire story and also directed the voice recordings has to be fired. I mean it's seriously been a long while since I've heard such terrible voice acting but also such a terrible story. I can imagine how emotional and interesting it could be if not for the wooden main character and how he only looks at things with emotions instead of using his own brain.. I mean everyone around him already talk to him like a little kid while being careful because he somehow has a lot of power. Oh and everyone calling Achilles an old man is just a terrible taste especially as it leads up to his passing.

~GRAPHICS: ~ look absolutely terrible.. This game was released originally 2012.. Remastered in 2019.. And it still looks like the biggest potato I have ever played. I mean.. Just how ? Insanely overuse of fog all the time.. It's like playing Minecraft on 6 chunks of render distance.. No wonder that you can play on 4K when you can't see sh*t. But besides the point, every character just look like such a massive downgrade of what the precursor games had. I cannot imagine what does a remaster to Ubisoft means but I think they are changing the definition of it.

~GAMEPLAY: Oh my lord.. It is boring AF.. Rinse and repeat.. How many of you would find it fun to run back and forth collecting feathers on trees and doing meaningless quests that gives you nothing useful nor any enjoyment out of it.. While the game gives you overly too much bulls**t bonus objectives for that 100% sync.. Raise your hands people. People with OCD should steer away from this.. Because achieving that 100% can be extremely difficult.. Not only because of the objective but also because you can't see the objectives if the UI makes them disappear so you don't even know that they are there and once you fail them, you can't exactly restart some of the missions to a checkpoint and therefore right back to the start of the mission SO HAVE FUN !!!!

But hold on, that's not it of course.. 

QUESTS: yes I have to make a dedicated section for this.. People writing the material for this, has truly lost a touch to this game and the point of it.. It didn't feel like it was planned out at all. I mean let's look at this example: quests to improve the houses.. Instead of actually improving, we do absolutely the MOST r*tarded quests I could think of that have nothing to do with my goal. It is so detached that it's just sad and extremely un-immersive. So what are the missions you might ask.. So get this, to improve a miners level, aka upgrading their home to produce better materials, I need to help him collect flowers for him to date a girl.. Now the questions is, what does that have to do with upgrading the miner for better materials. Yea I'm speechless about it and that is pretty much a lot of the quests in this game like this. Added with the brain of the main character.. Makes this game like playing Dora the explorer THE GAME. Also: There is a massive bug that basically hides your bonus objectives, meaning you wont know when there is some and whether they are any at all... It just f**king disappears and I was mad.. I was really mad. So you'll be needing to restart those missions a lot if you're seeking that 100% sync.


~ For many of the reasons, that I wrote up above, I will absolutely not put myself through any more suffering for the 100% sync nor the DLC that I did try and failed getting through one part. So I'm just gonna save the last brain cells that I have after playing this game and not continue it ever again.

Conclusion: Don't buy this game, it is not worth the 40$ price tag, it's game that was never finished, it's a game that is absolutely not enjoyable and there are no good perks from it. Avoid this game from this franchise as most of the rest of games are actually good and do have their qualities that you can enjoy. With all of the reasons I mentioned it's up to you whether you want to put yourself through suffering only for the story.

[u]I am so disappointed that they did not added the original speech which I was looking forward with many others.[/u]

This game is actually called remastered version but i don't see too much change in many aspects its a good thing but as well as bad. 

[b][u]The good thing is that everything from previous game is there and a little better and the bad thing is that there is nothing new. And it hurt me to admit this because being a Hardcore Assassin's Creed fan I was impatiently waiting for some new content but unfortunately there wasn't any.[/u][/b]

[b]Anyways its still the same two games that are separate but these are better not including the multiplayer mode from original ACIII.[/b]

I already wasn't fond of AC3, and this makes the third time I have played through the game. There is honestly just nothing redeemable about this game. Everything good is done better in AC4 and everything bad is just so frustratingly terrible. I was a bit kinder in my previous review of the original AC3, but my patience has run out. I hate this game. Anyway, this ""remaster"" is little more than a port to modern systems. It marginally improves the look of the game, but it still looks like its from 2012, so a pretty pointless upgrade. Other than that there are some minor QOL changes that the make the game slightly less tedious in some areas, but don't come anywhere close to fixing the big problems of the game. Also, the game is a buggy mess, but that's to be expected from Ubisoft. The fact that they're legitimately charging $40 USD for this is just baffling to me. It is barely an improvement over the original game, however it does include the DLC, Tyranny of King Washington, and the standalone remaster of Assassin's Creed Liberation. These also do not justify the price. I didn't get very far into TOKW, as the game started crashing constantly, and was just otherwise underwhelming. It's little more than an extension of the base game, set in winter in the frontier... fun.... Meanwhile, Liberation is a PS Vita game ported to console/PC, and it SHOWS. The game looks awful and plays worse. I got maybe 2 hours in before giving up, it's essentially a downgrade of AC3, which is an already mediocre game.

Don't buy this. And even if you got it for free with AC Odyssey like I did, it's really not worth playing, especially if you're just revisiting it. Skip this, play Black Flag instead if you really feel like it.",1593674800,1593674883,False,2,0,0.496212124824523926,0,True,True,False

[spoiler] this game has one of the most boring, uninteresting, by the numbers story that i have ever played. all of the characters come to illogical conclusions about each other, especially connor, who decides to murder a bunch of templars and red coats WHO WERE PROTECTING HIS HOME because lee tripped him in the forest, EVEN WHEN HE FINDS OUT WHO ORDERED THE RAID ON HIS VILLAGE, HE STILL GOES THROUGH WITH HIS ""promise"". fml [/spoiler]


the world? well glad you asked cause its so boring to explore. i didn't want any part of it. and i played this game multiple times before, and each time i wanted to less and less. the side missions are boring, the side characters are forgettable par 1 maybe 2 if i try really hard to remember their names. 

the frontier that was hyped up is nothing more than a forest with a couple trees you can climb in a linear path. yeah you can hunt rabbits and foxes but that's not what i come to play assassins creed for, sure its cool but it should be complimenting the environment, not just being the only thing in it.

the combat? even easier than ever. now there is literally no point in upgrading your weapons because you can one-shot every enemy, the chunky dudes might take an extra couple seconds - but nothing new, nothing upgraded over the ezio trilogy, which is a shame, because if there is something redeeming about it... its that sometimes it can feel cool to combo kill red coats with the tomahawk, but even then that gets repetitive the more you play.

the remaster? well it does look ""better"" in some scenes. but they did nothing to improve the character models, so they look really plastic-ey, they up-ressed the textures but that change isn't really noticeable. the lighting? yeah it looks nice, brings out the colour in this otherwise boring and depressing open world.

but the interface has not been changed, it still feels as if its in pre-alpha.
the game is still buggy as all hell.
and for some unknown reason, they still have not added back in connor's monologue at the end of the game.

and yes, i am one of the 3 people who have also played liberation. what do i think of it? honestly... its just fine. not a story really worth remembering. gameplay is exactly the same as in 3, maybe a little worse because the audio in this game is pretty bad, all of the effects are really dull for a ""REMASTER"". i actually think this game has better tree climbing than 3 because the bayou has much more tree variety in shapes, its a little more fun is what i'm trying to say. no visual improvements either. really just the icing on a otherwise lack luster cake.

....im just really sad right now. go play black flag that game has pirates and plundering.

Like this era of AC games all lacked, it misses a stealth essential; CROUCH. While I always loved the hidden blade parry insta-kills, I cannot find the actual combat very appealing at all. Look, I love stabbing people in the face 3 times to kill them just as much as the next guy, I can't help but lmao every time I've just shoved a blade through someone's skull MULTIPLE times and they are still alive and almost well. The pasing in this game could be way better. By the time you're adult Conor, with all of the main features of the game unlocked, you're already half way through it. Seriously. There are 12 sequences, and 6 sequences in you are still getting introduced to basic core mechanics. WILD. Speaking of wild, the hunting in this game is not bad. I remember feeling like this was the first AC to really delve into the RPG territory now that crafting was something you did with materials and not just money. The outside Animus sections where you get to actually go and DO something as Desmond are easily the coolest parts of outside Animus sections in the entire franchise, even though Desmond looks really weird in this game and the pre-Unity era AC parkour is very outdated. The story wasn't as bland to me as other people I have shared opinions with. I really liked how we actually got to [kind of] experience Conor becoming an Assassin. Through the story at least. We see him meet his mentor. Bug him to teach him. Get turned away. Fight some dudes outside trying to rob the potential-mentor. Mentor does the old guy Mr Miyagi savior thing. We find out mentor is a Master Assassin named Achilles. And while we don't get any cool training montages, we can still fill it in our imagination, unlike most of the other games.  All in all, I liked this game and I would recommend it to people who haven't played it and are trying to get into the franchise.

Additionally, there are some moments of juddery framerate but it's inconsistent, performance-wise.

Overall, the story is relatively enjoyable, but there is a dearth of side content besides Homestead missions and Liberation contracts, collectibles can get tedious due to no actual rewards and the cities lack the complexity and depth of newer titles along with the mechanics like finicky controls which can be difficult to go back to after a game like Origins. It's serviceable as an entry in the long-running franchise but the issues that were present in the first game, still reside here.

Feels like an entirely new engine, everything is improved, the fighting is smoother, the parkour is smoother and ofc the graphics are better, with new tech such as walking in snow which I remember blew my mind back in the day. 

Full sync is still here and still sucks (edit: is the most frustrating thing in the world, just dont bother doing full sync on the ship missions it's bloody impossible), in some ways it is worse as there are multiple per mission however the fact that you can actually reload the last checkpoint if you fail is much better.

The biggest improvement is that the main story feels like an actual character story, every mission is unique and crafted, characters are interesting.  I'm not saying the previous games had a bad story, just the mission structure feels different here, like an actual full on single-player story, like reading a chapter from a book. It took me 9 hours to get into the whole ""okay all the mechanics are available now"", so that tell you something about the story (though keep in mind you can explore any time). 
The First Civ and Desmond stuff is absolutely brilliant as always, my favourite part of the games.
The first 3rd of the story is great, 2nd is boring (this is where you spent half your time collecting stuff and doing busy work) and the last is great.

A big positive is Naval combat which is great fun! You can see the impact this game had as to this day naval combat is in every game.

Onto some negatives, View points don't reveal the map, you literally have to walk around to get rid of the fog. View points reveal missions I believe and you can still get treasure maps, this system is just a bit weird. Climbing to the top of trees can be frustrating and then when you get there most of the time you jump and there isn't a bloody bush. Every view point you can safely jump from but not the trees!
I love the main theme but aside from that the music is boring, unlike Brotherhood where I would love collecting stuff outside the city just for the music.

I've completed the main game now in 43 hours 97% sync (I can't be bothered to do all the Clubs missions and challenges, this wasn't a requirement in the last games, I'm not doing it in this one). 

I completed the Washington DLC in probably 5 hours, I skipped everything apart from the story because come on dude I spent hours in the base game collecting everything are you kidding me. This DLC is actually really cool, you unlock really awesome super powers basically. It's an ""alternate timeline"" (won't spoil anything) but Connor is aware that something isn't right, he was ripped straight from his world into this, so cool.

Completed Liberation story in about 10 hours, missed a lot of the collectables. Really didn't get into Liberation, the worst AC game so far, but, it is a spin off and not a main entry so whatever.",1591527226,1593253186,True,1,0,0.494252860546112061,0,True,False,False

I frequently had to restart missions because Connor got stuck or fell through the world, almost every other fight had an enemy's ragdoll start spinning out of control and flying into the sky, or the game would just crash. 

Unfortunately, even without the bugs, this is by far the worst Assassin's Creed game. The story is simultaneously too slow and too fast; it took me 6 hours before I was playing as Connor with all his features, and I skipped almost all optional content to get there. But once you do start playing as him, the story skips over major plot points and feels very rushed; we never get to see Connor actually develop his skills and he becomes an Assassin in a single cutscene. The world is bloated with side activities that basically don't matter. The fast travel system, specifically the underground, is terrible and a massive step back from the AC2 games. 

The only good part of this game is Liberation, which comes with it. It is also a bit buggy, but not nearly on the same scale as 3. Aveliene is a much more interesting character than Connor, and her story, though similar, feels a lot better.

Controls are too console-oriented to be comfortable on PC, and the menus are a disaster. Avoid this like a smallpox-infested blanket and play any other AC instead.

The American Revolution setting is quite interesting, but unfortunately most events and characters are not, and after seeing the ancient wonders and breathtaking landscapes of other AC games even the environment feels unremarkable.

Stupid ideas are still everywhere. How did they think climbing the same copy-pasted viewpoint trees and towers several times would be fun? Not to mention the awful pig-herding quest. Or the collectible on the island with the only climbable spot of rock not visible at all. Or Oak Island superwolves. I feel I could go on and on before even touching the catastrophic King Washington DLC.

Many quests still lack polish; for example, you may instantly fail objectives because of enemies spawning in unfair spots.

Frequently having to drop everything you're doing and fast-travel to defend a convoy is the AC equivalent of ""Another settlement needs your help"" in Fallout. With all the notification spam this game throws at you it's also easy to miss those ones, losing lots of valuable merchandise.

I had forgotten how deeply I hated the almanac pages getting lost because Connor tries to do everything but chase the damned things. This is where the poor controls really show.

It's unbelievable how hard it is to run straight. Connor wants to climb every lamp post, wall and tree that he strays too close to, and that seriously complicates movement, especially fleeing from enemies. Separate keys for running and climbing might've helped.

Horses are even clumsier than Connor, making even small rocks and ridges impassable to them. Good luck trying to take shortcuts through forests.

Stealth is difficult, because hiding spots are usually far from each other and in restricted areas (or with some notoriety) enemies recognize you almost instantly. The game randomly stops responding to keys and mouse clicks for a second or two, and you can imagine how that ends when trying to perform time-critical assassinations. This is why the game is full of boring, unnecessary clickfest fights against hordes of soldiers. Trying to reach a crier to get rid of notoriety often turns into more fighting, because towns are so full of soldiers. Insanely, it's much easier to just die or quit.

The game loves to hijack the camera, often making it go haywire when fighting in cramped places like alleyways, and there are some inexplicable forced camera angles throughout the game. I'd much prefer mouse control all the time.

Textures and models are improved and thus most graphics are better than the original, but faces have odd lighting issues and some even look oddly twisted, like they used models with incompatible textures. Mouths look weird with fully lit rows of teeth, and many eyes appear very unnatural. Bloodied people in assassination cutscenes look like they have chocolate on them. The new lighting system makes cannon aiming at sea hard, as sunshine or fog makes it impossible to see the white marked area.

The UI is sluggish because of unnecessary animations that block input. The menus are very unintuitive, and in many of them mouse doesn't work at all, turning crafting, trading and such into arduous chores. It it takes 15(!) key presses just to exit the game and probably more than a hundred to prepare a single trade caravan, because there are no presets or automation to make it quicker. You can't even switch both primary and secondary weapon with a single visit to the weapon wheel. Ubisoft should've hired some UX experts to fix this mess.

The Tyranny of King Washington DLC originally had a game-breaking bug that prevented me from completing episode 1. Unfortunately it feels like it has even more bugs now, but at least I got to play through the whole story. Even with Connor's new superpowers I didn't find it enjoyable.

I haven't played Liberation before, so I don't know how much that game has improved, but I came across the first (amateurish, I might add) bug before even starting a game; trying to adjust key bindings results in having the same key for up and down. Same with left and right. This makes the game unplayble for non-WASD gamers and after a year still hasn't been fixed. I haven't completed Liberation yet, but it surely can't save this dumpster fire alone.

I don't think it was even possible to fix this badly written unimpressive bugfest without starting from scratch, and Ubisoft didn't even seem to try very hard.",1589819301,1592049741,False,2,0,0.454340100288391113,2,True,True,False

The first hours of the game could have been a cutscene since you don't really get to do anything but be a passenger until Connor dons his robes. With AC3 you can see Ubisoft were struggling to find the balance between cinematic and gameplay presentation and the game is honestly an example of why kitchen sink design isn't always better. 

The titles have since improved but it's rough around the edges here, but here is where the more open world approach began so a little clunkiness is to be expected I guess. It's obviously not the best AC game but I think it's one of the most interesting stories. If you like story heavy titles and you enjoy the lore of AC you'll like this. If you're play games with a movie on in the background then you'll probably be bored to tears. 

As for the remaster, there's a lot they improved under the hood, not just graphically.

It adds some quality to life like being able to whistle from bushes, which you couldn't before. I enjoyed the game. 

The parkour and combat are an improvement from the previous titles. This game keeps the combo system that Brotherhood and Revelations introduced.

The story is pretty good. Not the best but certainly not as bad as Unity's story. Haytham is one of the best written characters in the series.

As for the protagonist, Connor, he takes a while to get used to. Going from a charming and funny protagonist like Ezio to a serious and deadfaced character like Connor was a risky move. Some people like him, some don't. I originally didn't like him when I first played this at launch, but now I do like him. He's bada$s. His combat movement is brutal and he is genuinely a scary dude you wouldn't want to mess with. 

The game gives you tons of activities to do like hunting, fighting, etc but it can get pretty repetitive because the only actual ""sidequests"" in this game aside from some of the DLC content added are the Homestead quests, which can all be completed in like two hours or so. 

I would not recommend the game at full price. Sure it's titled ""remaster"" and the game does look a tad bit prettier than the original, but it's really not worth 40 USD or whatever your price is at full price. I highly recommend getting it on sale though or with the Odyssey season pass.

I personally cannot recommend this game. It took half the game to get out of tutorial mode and by the time I did I was fed up with the awful combat and gameplay.  Oh just horrible.

Now there are a lot of things to do in the game but I just couldn't get them to work for me, (the crafting and homesteading system) so I just left all of that and proceeded only with the main story.

That was really disappointing and depressing too. Really sad ending, kind of wish I hadnt bothered to battle on to the end now.

If you get this game for free then maybe you might be able to figure things out better than I did so give it a try, but for me, this was the worst game I have played in a long while. (Sorry about that to the folks who made it)

There are parts of it I absolutely loved. Getting free from Ezio's storyline, hunting in the wilderness, the wide range of weapons and tactics.

There are parts of it that were... ambitious, but maybe not well thought-out. The homestead system, for instance, is a gaping missed opportunity - just a way to artificially restrict weapons with better numbers until you can build them. Convoys are functionally useless, as by the time you're getting real money from them you've got nothing to spend it on. You're not even able to make the best trade goods until the game is over, and then what's the point?

Quick time events make a larger part of the game than I'd like. The ship sections were *great*, and I can see why Black Flag decided to make that a much larger part, but they didn't seem terribly connected to the rest of the game - and you're only doing most of them to make the convoys safer, which doesn't serve any broader purpose.

And then... you get the story. I have no idea why, but it's like they decided they just didn't *need* half of it. They have characters acting like they've already been introduced, characters who've never interacted reacting to each other like they have a long history you should be aware of, or major plot events you only learn about because another character references it.

It also seems like they're trying and failing to make the Assassins v Templars moral debate more ambiguous - great. They way they do that, though, is to have the Templars make a lot of excellent points, and be composed of people mostly trying their best... and then to have no answer on the part of the Assassins. It's answered in-story by having the people you interact with being revealed as snarling, mustache-twirling villains under any stress, but that doesn't answer the argument.

Also, people who *know* you're well-armed keep just... leaving you with your weapons. And then they're surprised when you pick up the gun laying next to you and shoot them.

In the end, I have to recommend it, as it was a fun and engaging experience - but pick it up on sale. If I didn't know Black Flag was coming, and well-reviewed, I might have left the series here.",1590856791,1590856791,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the historical settings and stories that capture historical moments in time. I played through the first 4 games years ago and loved them. I started games in Unity and Syndicate and like those but stopped playing because I wanted to play the series in order. Despite that I bought Odyssey when it was released and I think it's almost one of the best games ever created (minus the upgrade system).

After putting 150 hours into Odyssey I decided to play through the entire series. I went and replayed the first 4 games, 100%ing each. I got to AC3 which is where I hit a roadblock the first time through. This time I'd play the remaster.

I tried many times in the past to play through AC3. But the game is just SO BAD. 

Forget about character development. You will never care about the character you're playing. I tried. Really hard. The ""intro"" is several hours long and only serves to severely disrupt the pace of the game and story. No one in the game has any endearing qualities. It's sad that the only non-white Assassin in the whole series is a complete asshole for no reason. I really wanted to like him but there's nothing to like.
The fighting controls are broken
The climbing is broken
NPC triggers are broken

Each mission becomes an excercise of patience as you try to wade from broken element to broken element. None of it is fun. The story is bad. The gameplay is a chore. Despite all of this I keep coming back telling myself I just need to power through this one game.

I returned to the game today after a few months off. I tried to climb a tree to the 'viewpoint' up top. But there's no discernable path to the top of the tree. You wind up at a branch where your only option is to swing and jump, but there is no where to jump to. No where to climb. I keep falling and dying and going up again thinking I'll find the proper path. But it's not there. Climbing a viewpoint should not be this much of a chore.

... and that 's it. I can't do it anymore. The game is a complete piece. I've started the game at least a dozen times and with dozens of hours played between the OG and the remaster I fail to find any redeeming qualities at all. It makes me sad because I wanted to finish Desmond's story if nothing else. 

With limited time and so many quality titles there is simply no reason to waste valuable time on Assassin's Creed 3. You will get nothing out of it.

>UPDATE: So after letting my frustrations pass I did lock in to power through the rest of the game in a long day.

I have to say that the last 1/3 of the game is significantly better than the first 2/3. The missions became more interesting, the story seemed to take shape and broken elements, while still present, were less intrusive and frustrating. By the end of the game I actually DID start to care for the characters, it took far too long however.

I am glad I powered through and finished Desmond's story. I had spent far too many hours with AC3 that letting it fall by the wayside would have felt incomplete. 

While the game does find itself late I still can not recommend this game to anyone for any reason beyond completionism. It's lacking in every department but most notably it's lacking in fun and in character development, two critically crucial areas.",1589218187,1590348120,False,19,4,0.522304177284240723,4,True,False,False

Full of bugs especially in the Tyranny of King Washington, like assassinating and going through the map and die, The graphics did not surprised me in any way, there were moments when the original game had better graphics than this remaster. The only things that were useful and I was happy about were maybe that they made the UI better when selecting weapons or free aim for the bow and pistol. 

Now a few words about AC Liberation Remastered: probably the WORST and misserable Remaster because the original game itself was a pile of trash. It is boring and slow af if you are going for the 100%, the story is not good at all and no one cares for the story of this baby girl. 

Should you buy the game separately? Short answer: definetely not, it's not worth even if it has the DLC with Washington because we know Ubisoft has very high prices for their DLCs

Why did you played this game then if you really did not liked it? Well there are some reasons: the first would be that I did not played the TTOKW DLC and I really wanted to play - it was a mediocre story. The second, well, it is that I wanted to replay Connor's story a bit and see if there were any improvements for the game. The last reason, well I wanted to get the Ubisoft Points to unlock rewards for other games or outfits. Played this game cause it was the ""last"" AC game that I had to finish and probably because I didn't had anything better to do in quarantine.

Another minus would be that it has no Muliplayer, but I don't think many would play those gamemodes today when you can play something else.

In conclusion, if you don't want to waste your time, just don't throw 40 euro away, and if you want to play, make sure you don't buy it alone because it comes with AC Odyssey Season Pass, so you better buy the Gold or Ultimate version of that game.",1589413496,1589413578,False,7,0,0.556141972541809082,0,True,False,False

With that out of the way I will say why.

The game has a great setting with some interesting characters that brings out the best and worst of that period of history. Gameplay loop is decent for the time of these AC games, but feels very lacking by today's more fast paced standards. The thing I like most is spending time collecting the plethora of collectibles and doing the side missions. Multiple different collectibles and challenges in different areas keep it fresh enough that I stayed engaged. 

Major cons. Some of the optional objectives are absolute garbage and complete bullshit that ruin the missions and immersion in the game. Having this badass moment but having to reload because of these really makes it annoying. Another major issues is the story really slips at the end. It feels like the game was rushed to completion and just had to skip somethings. The last three sequences could have been one sequence and it felt like there needed to be more. Not even gonna comment on how bad desmonds story line ends. Also the faces are FUCKED no idea what happened during the remaster but some of models on the faces are actually creepy how bad they look.

Overall it is a decent AC game. Grab it on sale if you like collecting stuff like I do. Main missions and story are mediocre at their best times. This game is easy to forget for many different reasons.

I've played through it numerous times, and I've always felt that this was an underrated entry in the series. The only thing that holds it back is the occasional bug here and there.  

These bugs are numerous enough to mention, but not so numerous that they ruin the game in its entirety. Sometimes an enemy counter marker won't appear, sometimes a bug will cause you to randomly fail an optional requirement for a mission, and sometimes a bug will require you to quit the game and come back so you can progress. Normally, that kind of thing would turn me off completely from an experience, but Assassin's Creed 3 has a lot going for it which kind of balance the scales.

For starters, AC3 has the best combat in the entire series. It's fluid, precise, and reminiscent of the Arkham games. Until this point in the series you'd essentially stand in the center of a mass of enemies waiting to counter. While that element still remains, there are enemies that will actively stop you from countering and even attacking. These enemies require different strategies. On top of this, every once in a while enemies will take aim and try to shoot you. You stop this by using an enemy as a human shield. Each encounter becomes an interesting combat puzzle, and you eventually get in to a combat flow. All of this keeps you on your toes in a way that hasn't happened before or since AC3. Even AC4, which uses a combat system similar to AC3, feels sloppy by comparison.   


AC3 also updates ideas from previous AC games and makes them better. As an example; this game also has its own version of the brotherhood, but the brotherhood isn't randomly generated no name npcs, but actual characters that you meet as you liberate sections of each city in the game. Each of these characters has a different skill that can be utilized in different ways. You can do stuff like call your assassins to dress up as Red Coats, ""arrest"" you, and escort you in to areas you wouldn't otherwise be able to get to. That's just one of six skills.

AC3 also innovated ideas that became standard in later entries. The naval combat was so good they built the entire next game around it, and it remains a part of the series to this day. Even if the idea of naval combat in AC4 turned you off for some reason, you don't have to deal with it much in AC3. Which allows you to give it a shot without risking your entire experience. It may even change your mind about AC4 if you give it a chance. 

In addition to how the game plays, I also really like the story and setting. One of the common complaints is that it takes a while to get to anything interesting. I personally disagree. The setup introduces one of the most interesting and well wrought characters in the entire franchise: Haytham Kenway. There is something about the beginning chapters of AC3 that give greater weight to the events of the main game in comparison to any other Assassin's Creed game.  Moreover, the main game takes place during the revolutionary war, so there was really interesting setting with characters that I was attached to. 
Some people complain about Connor, AC3's main character. I think that's because he isn't anything like Ezio, and not because he's poorly written. To the contrary, when you examine Connor even a little bit, you'll find an interesting character arc. Connor's arc centers around naivete. His beliefs are constantly betrayed by reality. In the beginning he thinks life is fair. By the end, he's grown in to someone who realizes that life isn't fair, but will fight to make it so. The line that defines him is ""because no one else will."" 
All in all, this is a remaster of a game I already liked, and I think they did a great job.  If you've never played AC3, I'd say give it a shot. My advice to anyone playing this game for the first time is to take your time. You'll hate this game if you rush through the story. Do homestead missions, build up your brotherhood, search for trinkets, do naval missions, etc. If you consider main missions to be the last thing on your list, you'll have a much better time. 

However, if you've already played AC3 and didn't like it, I honestly don't know if this changes your mind. 
Now, I'm sure there are some reading this who already like AC3, and want to know if the remaster is worth it. At around 20.00, I think it is. Anything above that, and I may start questioning whether or not it was worth the purchase. By and large there are nothing but improvements but there are some things that hold it back. The game has a slick new lighting engine, and redone textures that look fantastic. There are also some quality of life adjustments. Generic loading screens are black instead of a blinding white, for example. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the way the lighting engine affects how the characters look sometimes. Sometimes, the improvements to the faces are very noticable. Othertimes, you wonder if they screwed up importing old assets. It's kind of a crapshoot when it comes to the character art sometimes.

I see parts of it here and there, but it keeps slipping away. The game have its moments, some of them are even great momonts, but all of this is shadowed by a huge pile of rubbish you have to dig through to see them.

PROS:
- Desmond's side of the story is ok. The ending is a bit underwhelming after waiting for it for 4 games, but otherwise it is good.
- Sea battles are fun.
- There are time when you realise, that actually this game is far more clever then you give it credit. And if you watch carefully, there are some rather interesting revelations.

CONS:
- Connor story was... meh. Like I said earlier, there are a good moments, but they usually dwarf before the totally uninspired writing.
- I counted 5 places where an opportunity for a good oneliner was totally botched, and we got a belove average one insted.
- Controls are total garbage. I understand you went on to completly new engine and control design, but this sh... stuff will make you die. And die. And die againg. And again... you get the picture. And is it me, or Rematered actualy broke it even more?
- Connor/Ratohnhaketon is a total mess as a person and is all over the place. My opinin - the developers were not sure what to do with him.

CONCLUSION:
I suspect that the game was released totally rushed and underdeveloped. Given more time and a bit of better writting, it could have became one of the best games of it's kind on the market.

It's the most disappointing Remastered and I felt like as if it's as worst as Warcraft 3: Reforged.
The problem isn't the graphic Ubisoft.... The problem is the gamebreaking bugs. I have finished my original AC3 with no problem and yet when I try to 100% this one it shows an old bug that people already had complained in the forums of original game.

Here's the things that bothers me in game :
1) Wanted Poster --> For realism , I thought wanted posters are supposedly placed on public areas where people can see them but oh they did the same thing like in previous games... It's kinda ridiculous trying to bribe or print news to reduce just a level 1 notoriety 

2) Parkour system is still crap that I feel like the brotherhood and Revelation gave me more combo and fluidity to traverse around better than this game. Maybe it's more to the settings of the world that kinda prevent me from doing so rather than the pre-built course for certain missions

3) THE REOCCURRING PROGRESS BUG IN THE ORIGINAL
I mean seriously... I thought remaster was suppose to fix bugs that prevents me from completing (And I mean pure completionist) the game. It's so annoying when I know that I have fully recruited the assassins and leveled them up to Assassin rank and still the progress tracker said ""30-60% completed"" (It varies on the assassins) . Not only the Liberation missions, but the delivery as well where I have 0% completed even though I finished all of it. (And I've seen someone complained about this in the Ubisoft forums as well, so I'm not the only one)

And the only advantage to this game?? Graphic?? NO, the graphic itself only got sharper in the lighting and color choice, the rest of the models still looks like clay and facial animations sometimes don't even work same goes to the lip-syncing. And I asure you I play this on highest settings the game allow me possibly. 

There are a lot more bugs that people encounter in this game, but I'm just talking from my own perspective and experience.
If I have to be honest, I would rather play the previous trilogy or even the AC Brotherhood Remaster that offers not much but at least it doesn't hinder me from completing the game 100%

I've played many games of the Assassin's Creed series and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had. I did not play the not remastered version but without a single doubt I can say that the devs put literally 0 effort into the remaster. Too many bugs to count, starting from the smallest visual bugs which aren't that big of a deal to game breaking bugs in main story missions that require you to repeat the same mission over and over if you're 1 of the people who's trying to achieve that 100% sync like me.

Not to mention there was nearly not a single main story mission that the side objectives were harder than beating a dark souls bosses blindfolded (if you don't believe me simply check online the side objective of any random main story mission of your choice). And that's not it, there's also the side missions with the ridiculous optional objectives that will cause you to repeat the mission at least 30 times.

However, there are major issues with this game, the bulk of which are the result of poor design choices.

1) Attack and Take Down are the same button, which will sometimes result in your character attacking your target rather than assassinating them. Not necessarily a huge deal, except when doing a mission that requires you to ""avoid detection"": instant mission failure.

2) The only person that noticed/detected me is the person I'm about to take out, yet this fails me a mission? Unless their ghost is going to inform everyone else, this design decision makes no sense.

3) ""Whistle"" being the same button as 'loot' and 'interact'. Trying to sabotage some cannon in a fort under cover of darkness? I guess I'll just whistle while I work..................

4) A lack of checkpoints/saves in missions makes it extraordinarily frustrating when you are detected due to a crappy design choice and have to start the whole damn thing over again from the start. Multiple times, as it fails in a different way each time.

This is without getting into clunky controls, sticky ladders, and all the rest of the usual things that tend to be problems in open world RPGs.

PERSONAL OPINION: My least favorite Assassin's Creed game (this is to part 3, not Liberation) for two reasons which isn't related to it being recommended or not recommended: The character Connor being bland and a whiny ***** and the fact you need to manually reveal the entire map yourself where viewpoints don't reach. That junk took me 5 hours alone on just the Frontier map!

For me it's a thumbs up because the bugs I experienced weren't that bad and some were also quite hilarious. Another reason is the fact I can actually play the DLC story, I never had the chance in the original version since the servers to activate it are gone.

Assassin's Creed Liberation I had no issues or bugs, just a simple replay of the game from my end.

Assassin's Creed 3 is where all the weird stuff happened. A random guard corpse stretches out indefinitely  and freaks out till its out of existence. While doing a chain kill, i randomly got launched way higher than any building and fell to my death, this happened only once. Your primary weapon disappears sometimes randomly and sometimes during special gun executions, no real issue since you can disarm and get another weapon.

Some voice lines won't be heard at all so captions are recommended. The second half of the base game can have intense framerate drops in Assassin's Creed 3 during cutscenes and there is sometimes a loading screen just to pause the game at all. The lip syncing is way off in a lot of cutscenes as well.

Not worth buying this directly, it's definitely recommended to get for free from that Odyssey season pass though.",1587441731,1587441731,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Okay, I have 51 hours playing the game, however, that's more because it takes a pretty bad game for me to drop it completely.  I suppose I'm a bit of a masochist as even if I don't care for a game I still try to complete as much of the side stuff as possible as long as it interests me.

So far, I've only played Assassin's Creed 1 and 2/brotherhood/revelations and though it's been awhile, 3 + Liberation feel like they were a step backwards.  I can't remember how long it took for the previous games to open up, but it seemed like you spent at least half of Assassin's Creed 3 + Liberation playing the tutorial before you have the entire world opening up.  Even then, most of the stuff was pointless: gold was easy enough to make and there wasn't really anything to spend it on unless you are someone who must have every outfit and weapon in the game - as far as I can tell, the different weapons were worthless.  Enemies seemed to die based upon the number of hits and not the amount of damage a weapon does so you can pretty much just use whatever you want.  The side quests were mostly pointless (though I did like the Homestead stuff in 3 as I like base building stuff even if it was really just minor quests) and the viewpoints were absolutely useless - in 3, they don't even unlock new quests like I remember from prior games and barely reveal the map so there was no point in using them.

Traversal was obnoxious - both characters were all too happen to try to climb everything (even if all you wanted was to run - typically away from someone), yet, it seemed like there were few opportunities to actual climb stuff as Ubisoft seemed to have restricted where you climb - this was especially annoying in the Bayou in Liberation as it was hard to find ways up into the trees to avoid the swamps.  I also found the characters had a tendency to love to jump off if you were even the slightest off on your targeting where you wanted to go.  This was made worse in timed quests where you often had to chase someone in a time limit and had to figure out the way you are supposed to go.

To me, Assassin's Creed is all about running around on rooftops and such with cool and unique ways to kill people, but there were too many quests where you have to either slowly tail someone and/or avoid killing anyone at all.  Maybe it makes sense as something an assassin would do, but the majority of the assassin's creed games aren't like that - just a few missions.  They wouldn't be so bad if it was like say Dishonored were you can still fight your way out of things, but in Assassin's Creed, you fail a mission if you are supposed to be stealthy and it's the forced stealth in what I would say is primarily an action game that bugs me.  Want a completely stealthy game? Fine, just advertise it as such and I wouldn't bother buying a game.  Liberation made it even worse - not only were there stealth sessions, but you have 3 ""persona"" (lady, assassin, slave) that you are forced to play as the lady or slave and in the case of the lady, you can't even run along rooftops which I think is a key point of the Assassin's Creed series.

There's probably more (I know some people hated the protaganist of 3 for some reason, but he didn't bother me), but I can't think of them right now and the review is probably long enough:

TLDR, they are probably okay games, but mediocre stories, pointless quests/weapons/gold (unless you must 100% the game) and too many stealth/no kill missions in a game where I detest those missions, leads me to say no, I wouldn't recommend 3 or Liberation to others.",1587262708,1587262708,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AC3 is an ambitious (for the time) game that feels great to play but could have used a bit more time in the oven. I encountered quite a lot of bugs, such as glitching enemy ragdolls, gaps in geometry, and even targets being stuck inside walls and carriages, requiring a checkpoint reset. The game likes to take its time with you, as well. It takes 8 or so hours to be playing as an adult Connor, which may be frustrating if you don't enjoy the opening story, and some side activities can be very tedious and are best avoided, such as unlocking the fast travel points in Boston and New York through an underground walking simulator. Connor himself is a divisive character who can come across as dull if you don't resonate with him, so be warned that there is a high chance you may just dislike the guy.
On the positive side, the game presents a beautifully realised version of Revolutionary America and managed to bring to life a period of history that, as a Brit, I had no real interest in prior to playing. The three main maps of Boston, New York, and the Frontier, are all fun to explore and look great in the remaster. If you don't mind the long setup in the beginning, the story is great with a lot of interesting character dynamics, especially the one between Connor and his father. Combat is fast-paced and brutal, with some really great animation work, and when everything flows together you really feel like a one-man army. A few of the side missions really shine, as well. The homestead missions bring together a bunch of minor characters in a really endearing set of interwoven stories that made me like Connor a great deal more, and the naval missions are a fun change of pace and very well executed (but do admittedly feel a bit like a tech demo for Black Flag).

The DLC is a standalone story that takes place in an alternate universe where Washington gets the Apple of Eden and uses it to become a dictator. It's much more of a straight shot than the base game, really only consisting of story missions, and is mostly worth playing for the broken animal spirit powers you unlock in each of the three episodes. It's an excuse to have Connor be a badass for a few more hours and as a result it's pretty simple fun.

Liberation is perhaps the easiest of the three to like. It's long enough to feel like there is something real to sink your teeth into, without overstaying its welcome. The setting of New Orleans and the Bayou is great, and Aveline is a solid protagonist.  Its central mechanic, being able to change between three outfits with different abilities, is a bit underutilised, but this can be a good thing as it never feels too gimmicky. Liberation is a lot less buggy than the base game, as well. It's got an old-school vibe that reminded me of early 2000s adventure games for some reason, and overall feels like a mix of the mission structure and gameplay loop of the AC2 trilogy with the combat and free-running of AC3 ported in, which comes together great.

Overall, the three games together are probably not the first Assassin's Creed games you would recommend, but if you are interested in the setting or like classic AC and missed these games the first time around, then It's a solid choice for your next 60-80 hours of gaming (but probably best picked up on sale or free with the Odyssey season pass).

Both games happen in the same timeline of the American Revolution but at different places. Both games are great, but I especially liked AC Liberation the most for its story and its game play.

Combat is great, much better than the system Ubisoft implemented in their AC Odyssey. Progression system is good ,as you progress into the game, you will unlock more powerful tools and equipment.

Only downside of both these games are the graphics. Yes of course, they are better than the originals as they are remastered version, but compared to late AAA games, the graphics are outdated. In AC Liberation, the team seem to have forgot to implement an anti aliasing method....too much aliasing.

Overall, I recommend getting AC 3 Remastered as both games included ( AC 3 + Liberation) have interesting story and good game play and many extra missions as well ( I finished both AC 3 and Liberation in 80 hours).

Assassin's Creed 3 alone is a massive game and the fact that this Remastered comes with it, all of its DLC and a copy of Assassin's Creed Liberation make the pack more than worth it on full price, especially if you are a person who has not played Assassin's Creed 3 back in the day. However if you do happen to own Assassin's Creed Odyssey I would get that titles Seasons Pass as it cost the same amount as this title and it comes with this Remastered on top of all of the DLC content available to Assassin's Creed Odyssey. If you have played the title I would suggest getting this Remastered from a sale. I will mainly talk about Assassin's Creed 3 and not Liberation on this review, as it is clear that most of the changes were made keeping Assassin's Creed 3 in mind and Liberation has just been added here as a pleasant bonus for the people who never had the chance to play it either on the PSVITA or the HD release on other platforms.

 a Pleasant experience through this content rich game, probably the first Assassin's Creed game that could've been considered overwhelming due to the content abundance back in the day. The graphics, draw distances, crowd sizes and textures have been improved for the most part, outside of the character model faces, that at least at the beginning of the title seem somewhat worse than on the original game, most likely due to the new lighting system messing preset details on cutscenes and what not. However basically every other aspect has been updated and improved (in terms of graphics) and some things such as clothes and vegetation are greatly improved. Outdoor areas also benefit from the warmer color pallette as the original release of this game had the potential to look rather bleak, grey and dull in line with a lot of games from the mid / late PS3 / XBOX360 era.

 Other small improvements from the original are small, but still should be talked about. These include changes to the mini map. Now instead of small red dots different types of enemies and the direction they are looking or going to are marked clearly and this makes navigating withing and around them much easier. Alongside this the different button prompts and the actions they cause are displayed on the top right corner of the screen at all times, something most of the games in the series had but for some reason was changed on the original release of Assassin's Creed 3 (the Ezio collection and Black Flag had this button layout alongside some other games) and the addition of this is great as it is far easier to telegraph what different actions during free roam or combat achieve. Free aim for all ranged weapons has also been added, again making the title to be more in line with other games in the series such as Black Flag. You are also able to whistle from most hiding spots, something that used to be reserved for only cover locations such as behind high walls or crates. These gameplay additions make playing the game stealthily far more pleasant and actually going back to the original version of the title just ends up feeling like something is missing from the experience. Other small changes I noticed was changes to the loading screens that used to be blinding white in the original release and here they have been changed to be black, a neat addition if you happen to play a lot during evening hours and don't enjoy having a flashing white light burning your eyes in the dark each time the game wants to load a cutscene or something along the line. Also an annoying lock pick puzzle that used to be there for most treasure chests in the game world has been removed from them and instead can only be found on some doors within the story mode or while unlocking fast travel locations on some of the maps. This change might be small, but it does remove a tedious aspect from the looting and opening of chests during free roam and has in turn made the lock pick puzzles into a more memorable mini game, rather than a tedious grind while playing.

Outside of some average visual jank I did not run into any deal breaker bugs or glitches during my playthrough. The only real noticeable glitch really was the potential to have some sound effects loop infinitely (such as the music for liberating a fort / syncing view points) but a quick fast travel or a return to the main menu of the game and reloading it would fix these issues. Overall I enjoyed my completionist time in the title and was able to find new missions and side activities that I had not done during my original run of the title. Some gripes from the original, such as Connor as a main character being a little bland still stand, and obviously could not have been changed without a complete rework of the title and its story. Thankfully many of the other major side characters shine brightly from the townsfolk of your settlement (Davenport) and Connors Father Haytham Kenway and his Assassin mentor Achilles Davenport were some of my personal favourite characters in the title. 


:so to sum it up the pack includes:
Assassin's Creed 3 
Assassin's Creed Liberation 
updated graphics and some quality of life changes to the gameplay.
All singleplayer DLC released for the two titles
New franchise character costumes can be unlocked for use in-game (through Uplay, which you need in-order to play this Remaster).

:Not Included:
Assassin's Creed 3 multiplayer and any DLC related to the multiplayer game mode of the original title.

 While I had played the multiplayer a fair bit back in the day it by no means has ever been the focus of the series and in all honesty I don't mind it (the multiplayer) missing. This version of the two titles is by far the best way to play them. This remastered does not fix the core issues of the two titles but with the improved graphics and quality of life improvements to the gameplay I can never be able to go back and play the original releases of the Assassin's Creed 3 or Liberation now that this Remastered is out. For veterans of the series this Remaster might not feel as it would be enough of a change to go back, but for hardcore fans of the series, like myself, and for newcomers this is the best way to experience Assassin's Creed 3, Liberation and all the singleplayer content these two titles have to offer.",1553886948,1585606017,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its a little bit slow, and probably not one of the best AC Games, but it was probably worth playing.  Getting the upgrades for the ship seemed a little bit too easy though in my opinion.  Same with the weapons.  Once you had them there was no point in continuing to trade.  

AC Liberation, on the other hand - total garbage in my opinion.  I still played through it - but I sort of wish I could have those hours of my life back.  The game style was stupid, with 3 different personas to play.  Two of them were nearly useless except when it MADE you use them.  And when you were in the assassin's persona, you could never get rid of your wanted level completely, which I found irksome.  The upgrades on this one were ridiculously easy to get and money was super easy to make.  I had all the desired upgrades in no time flat.

It was so fractured and disjointed.  It didn't really mesh worth a damn, and the whole Citizen E thing was also completely irrelevant.  The game was also VERY short.  I was at the end thinking ""Oh maybe the plot will get good now"" and BAM, game over.  But not before throwing in a pointless Citizen E assassination.  Man I'm super glad it was included with the odyssey season pass.  If I paid extra for this game I'd have been upset.  I don't know why it was a standalone game.

One glitches, sure they are funny but are too annoying when taking things seriously as a true gamer. Falling through the floor, not given direct instructions on what to do, long lasting battles cause everyone just wants to come in, hiding mechanics since when you go in some hay, they don't see you anymore but you're immediately pushed out instead of enemies trying to get you out. Framerate, I had to put my graphics so low to try and enjoy it but the scenes look terrible still cause their faces look like neanderthals. Free running looks like you're going up and down due to the terrible camera panning, fire makes everything terrible since when fire is right in front of you you take damage and lose that 100% sync for that one stupid extra level. What I'm saying is get the non remastered version, its probably way better since I could write a whole essay of why you shouldn't since you're probably thinking of getting this for the story of Assassin's Creed as well. Just play it if you played the original, this is really for the environment aspect instead of story which really ruins it since this is the first time I played the third game.

Although the title is remastered, it's hardly said as one. The combat just slightly becomes easier but that's it, no so called meaningful improvement or anything. The graphic is more or less the same. And just like any other Ubisoft's games, this game is full with bugs  (I have to repeat missions several times because of either the target didn't come out or because the game stopped in the middle of mission) and the gameplay is unbearably trying my patient. Not many skip option in the naval mission so if you failed, you have to see the entire animation again. Unlike the newest installment, this series doesn't let you to fast travel to all synchronization points that you already unlocked. This is bothersome because you need to travel far just to get to your destination. I played this game because I bought the Gold edition of Assassin's Creed Odyssey and this includes as a bonus. If it wasn't included, I'm surely not going to buy it. I have enough with Ubisoft's products.

DLC: The idea of the spirit animals is amazing however, I find it (whether it's a glitch or not) the control of the eagle flight is a bit off, especially for assassination. The story itself is mediocre for me. As usual, there are some glitches here and there (why I'm not surprised) and some of the optional objectives are really annoying and frustrating. 

Assassin's Creed: Liberation
Hm....FINALLY! I finished these broken trash games. There are several bugs in the gameplay and some of the optional objectives are really unnecessary and annoying, especially the part when Aveline need to navigate through the underwater tunnel by using the canoe. I have to repeat it several times to understand how to steer it since the tutorial is misleading and you can't skip it. Also, is it me or Ubi just port it directly from Switch version directly to PC without giving much improvement? (Whenever I launch the Liberation, the Warning sign always comes very small as if it was fit for Swtich version then after few seconds it zoomed out to match PC display). For the plot, it has potential however, lacking some depths here and there. The only thing that I find cool from the gameplay is the fact that Aveline can get an instant-kill after mauled by an Allie (u called it gators, but I call it Allie since it's cuter). I actually got mauled thrice and honestly, it really scares me. Besides that, the changing persona things are also cool and new to the whole ascreed franchise. Perhaps Ubi should consider to use it again in the next installment. 

Lastly, now I know why Ubi gives these two games as a bonus. It's because they're so lacking in many ways and really if you want to fully synch it, it takes a long time. Not because of the story is long but the fact they're full with bugs and annoying optional objectives.",1574928925,1583083750,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Crashy, laggy, questionable connection to the ubiservers. Tutorials that come up CONSTANTLY and block up parts of the screen. Holds your hand or outright railroads you through huge sections of the plot. Has a central conceit that concerns a choice of approaching problems yet usually only lets you even try one approach.

Liberation is a really fascinating experiment on Ubisoft's part, but they seem to have no understood what the point of an experiment is. When you conduct an experiment in a business and artistic sense, you strike out and do a small job with a dedicated team, which Liberation received. You don't then expect it to sell gangbusters. Instead you evaluate the end product and incorporate its good ideas and strip its bad ones into your future work. No such thing happened to Liberation - I can't find any trace of its unique ideas heading downstream in later Creed titles. And its unique ideas, when it actually lets you use them and works properly, are gorgeous and fascinating. The different ways the city of new orleans evolves over the plot and the way it shifts the effectiveness and roles of the different personae Aveline can adopt is magnificent, and if you're interested in experiments of this kind it's worth the price of admission when steeply on sale.

Assassins Creed 3 is not a good game to begin with, but this so called ""remaster"" makes it look even worse. The facial animations, even on the main character, are extremely rough, especially the in-game rendered animations. Whereby, they do not even match the words spoken or the mouth just looks floppy and goofy. Truthfully, this is just a graphical upscale, and in no ways fixes any problems the original game had on PC besides allowing it to run better on modern machines and a slight graphical update. Otherwise, its a terrible game, and the ""remaster"" adds more bugs, glitches, and problems the original game was already filled with.

The main character, Connor, is the most antipathetic and uninteresting character I've ever come across. Even the evil protagonists are likable  or at least interesting as characters. 

He behaves like a spoiled retarded brat (sort of a ""how dare you"" male Grеtа, with Iroquois feathers), not a seasoned warrior who went through personal losses and conflicts to become a man. BTW, he was designed that way, because pretty much every protagonist , ally, enemy or stranger tell this naive DICK to grow the f... up, one way or the other.

Haytham Kenway, among others, is very well depicted and voiced. The historical characters act a little young and immature (common theme here?), but I don't know if it is maybe historical accurate (don't really mind it because it is not bothersome in contrast to Connor).

PS: As a Star Trek Fan , I was pleasantly surprised to hear John de Lancie (Q) voicing one of the characters in the beginning :)

The parkour being moved to one button has ruined it, no longer is your movement around the city smooth and cinematic, instead you now run up walls when going round tight corners, run up fences instead of darting between them, and its blatantly obvious that they changed it thi way to make gameplay previews/trailers look good in the forest, since you can now 'quickly' dart through the trees. That would be fine, except it doesnt even work properly in the trees. If I had a dollar for every time I just jumped out of the tree instead of climbing it or moving to the next one. 


The guards can see you round corners and through walls, and in some places they literally spawn infinitely so you are forced to run away from a certain area. There are so many guards that if you have level 3 notoriety it becomes near impossible to play the game because every guard knows where you are at all times, and when you're running away from one group, the second group that's round the corner suddenly gets wall hacks, and runs right to your position.

furthermore, the town criers, who you have to bribe to lower your notoriety, are mixed right in with the hordes of guards so half the time when you try go to one to bribe them, you just get attacked by all the guards in the area. And when you manage to kill them all, the town crier is scared and runs away. You spend half your time just trying to run away/hide from guards than actually being able to explore/enjoy the game. The audio is horrible, every single ""hit"" sound is just the same generic slicing sound that just repeats constantly during fights, it sounds awful. Not to mention the ""HD"" remaster making most of the characters just look like waxwork dummies.

And of course there's the tons of bugs that never got patched out, characters ragdolling/flying everywhere, objects not appearing, props you can walk through since nobody bothered to add collision to them, and the most irritating bug - game doesnt register some button inputs so sometimes you cant block/parry, and everyone looks like a partially melted waxwork. Characters legitimately look better in the original. 

And finally, the sound direction is torture on the ears. The mixing for character audio is really bad, most of the voices do not sound natural or like they are speaking in the location the character is in, everyone sounds like they are talking into a microphone in a sound studio.",1561933639,1581167013,False,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

[h1] Assassin's Creed III [/h1]
In Assassin's Creed III You take on the role of Haytham Kenway a British noble sent to assassinate a friend for a mystical artifact, tasked to find the origin of the trinket you are sent to America, where you fall in love with a native woman whom you rescued, as she shows you there is more to the trinket than meets the eye. After a romantic exchange you discover you've been playing as a Templar all along, the native woman baring your child. Enter Ratonhnhaké:ton, or Connor as no one cares to remember the native name or make any effort to pronounce it. Connor's quest to negotiate a future for his people against the backdrop of revolutionary war is well written and often well acted. The game's treatment of issues of race, class, democracy and empire even manages to be insightful, and Ubisoft have no qualms about turning America's founding mythology on its head. But for myself, this is where all the ""glory"" ended. 

I am pursuing a man in a tricorner hat through the streets of colonial New York. In the top-left of the screen, Assassin's Creed III instructs me to chase him. In smaller text just below it, there is a secondary objective: ""Do not shove or tackle anyone"". I turn sharply into an alleyway and barge past a woman, earning myself a red X on the mission log and losing my ""full synchronisation"" bonus. I'm not sure why I want to be fully synchronised, but the completionist in me insists that I must try again.

A few attempts later, I've figured out a system. Stop sprinting when the alleyways give out onto open streets, edge carefully around pedestrians, and continue. It's ludicrous, why on Earth would I not shove someone, if the fate of a nation was at stake, but I've not incurred the red X, I've not lost my bonus. I chase the man and, as is tradition, wait for the cutscene where I catch him. It doesn't come. We pass through the same fishmarket for the second time and I realise that we've done a lap of central New York. The game is waiting for me. ""Oh!"" I think. ""This is an assassination, I do those"". I can't get close enough to use my hidden blades so I wait until we're running down a clear alleyway, pull my flintlock, and fire. Desynchronised? Target was killed. 

It takes another couple of tries before I figure out that the game wants me to catch him, tackle him, if you will. My objective is to give chase. My sub-objective is to not tackle or shove anyone. The solution is to tackle someone. You may Google your own facepalm jpeg.

Assassin's Creed III features the strangest and most self-defeating mission design in the the series' history, and it's a huge shame. Making me care little to nothing about full synchronisation. 

The game also has a nack of breaking emersion by ripping you from the animus at pivotal points of the story, so you could continue the tedious life of Desmond. I don't quite understand whether it is the way Assassin's Creed III was written, or whether both protagonists just felt like arrogant children whining about a destiny neither of them wanted, and this in turn made me hate Desmond more than I initially did. As for Connor, he protests every chance he gets, refusing advice and following his ""heart"". Although on the surface it could make for a great character, it leads to scenarios that could have otherwise been avoided. 

The main plot of the game was fantastic, with multiple sub plots, twists and a conspiracy that would keep you in its clutches, were it not for the constant interruptions of Desmond and his team. The constant interruptions made the game difficult for me to enjoy, especially with no quest markers appearing with Desmond, and at the end of it all, Desmond was but a mere pawn for the precursors leaving him with a ""choice"" of the world ending once more in glorious fire so it could rebuild, or saving the world by giving his life and freeing a precursor named Juno. Apart from the ridiculously poor conclusion, the game tries its very best to paint heroes as villains and villains as heroes. But in doing so, it resulted in inconsistent personalities and poor story driven choices. It took 5 installments for such a stale conclusion, killing a lead no one cared for. With such a grandiose build up my only question was, what would the templars REALLY have done differently? This made the centuries of war between Templar and Assassin seem pointless. 

Apart from the tasteless conclusion, I've never felt so conflicted with a main characters choices. I couldn't decide if I should sympathise or hate Connor. Overall Assassin's Creed III is undeserving of the praise it has received over the years. The 6/10 rating on steam is definitely more adequate. 

[h1] Assassin's Creed Liberation [/h1]
When Assassin's Creed Liberation was released on the Vita, the series’ ever-growing ambition and scope seemed watered-down and constrained, despite Sony’s powerful hardware. Sadly, seeing it on a bigger screen has only placed a spotlight on its lackluster design. If before it came off like a favorite shirt that got shrunk in the wash, here it looks like someone tried to stretch it back out by pulling on every thread. It’s definitely the best way to experience Aveline’s story, but after Assassin’s Creed Revelations and Assassin's Creed III, Liberation looks and plays like a bush-league imitation. 

Liberation Remastered can, at moments, look like it belonged on the PS3 and 360 from the start, particularly when you roam New Orleans in the comely glow of daylight. Building textures and lighting effects got a lot of love, but not nearly as much was furnished on things like water effects, foliage, or skin textures. Not to mention the poor voice acting with the odd npc shouting ""huh"" in a dull tone, or even lines being re-used over and over to fill the empty shell of a game. For every minute I spent soaking up the sun and the 18th century ambiance, I spent two more slogging through the blurry, colorless bayou. This visual inconsistency made it difficult to ever truly lose myself in Liberation’s world the way its unique setting begged me to.

The story is an incoherent mess, jumping from one scene to another with no real connection to one another. It feels as if the story was written gracefully and with great intent, but handed to a preschool child to cut and paste his favourite parts of each piece. You start the game off by playing as a young Aveline, chasing after a chicken as if it is some creature of wonder and mystery. But in doing so you lose your mother, desperately trying to find your way back to her, a guard knocks you behind the head for pestering a civilian who bared resemblance to your mother, and as you fall to the ground, you jump back up as a fully grown Aveline fighting thugs. As you finish off the last thug you wake up screaming, only to be comforted by a strange woman. Who turns out to be your stepmother. No proper transition or progression of time, no scene melting from one to another. Just tiny morsels fed to you one by one. 

Missions are, with rare exception, narrow and straightforward, and the number of banal fetch quests boggles the mind. Around half of your 12-hour life as an assassin is spent running painfully long stretches from point A to B only to talk to, pick up, or interact with someone or something.  Your would-be assailants still predictably telegraph every attack, and politely wait their turn to take a swing so you can counter, and instantly kill them in an orderly fashion.

Assassin's Creed Liberation is unfortunately a game in the series that should never have come to pass.",1581091906,1581092293,False,23,4,0.657631576061248779,0,True,False,False

PROLOGUE

This is ACIII ladies&gents.The most controversial up to date AC Game.Many opinions out there about this game.But everyone has their own opinion/review.Here is mine.


Story 7/10:Not a perfect storyline.Very long.Many chapters.Connor's vengeance drives this AC Story mainly but there are other moments that define Connor more clearly other than only being a vengeful,brute,and loner character.Not so much depth but many feels and nostalgia will come out of you if you have accepted this game a bit.Sidequests:Because this is an open-wrold type of game of course you would expect to see many sidequests,collectibles etc,ready for the taking.All these are optional but provide for some extra hours of playtime outside of the main storyline after you're done.Or for those that want to get the 100% completion of the game,as i did.

Gameplay 6/10:It takes a bit of getting used to,certainly better than the AC Ezio games but worse than the Edward Kenway AC Game ""Black Flag"".The aiming system is by far the worst.I rarely aimed with a bow and arrow outside of hunting animals.The parkour system has been re-invented and is essentially a new additon to the higher resolution and higher quality AC Games before the new generation AC Games,like AC Unity&Syndicate.Much better than the AC Ezio games.

Soundtrack 5/10:Pretty boring to say the least.The only soundtrack that i clearly remember is the main menu main theme music.The other parts of the soundtrack are pretty much vague to me.


TOTAL:7,5/10


DLC REVIEW:""The Tyranny Of King Washington""


This DLC surprised me.It's an unconventional one.It's in a different reality and more like a dream for Connor.

Story 7/10:George Washington has gone rogue,is a tyrant instead and has joined the Templars.Naturally,you have to stop him.Sidequests are also present here but have a more structural and important role here.Not all are required.

Gameplay,Soundtrack and soundeffects are the same.

Maybe it just took a second playthrough, (the only other time I played it was back on the Xbox 360 when it came out), but I find the game a little less boring. The homestead missions are more in-your-face, now. In a good way. They really add to the story and Connor's personality. 

The story is still pretty boring, though. It only gets ""fun"" and interesting after Sequence 7 or so, near the end of the game. The pacing of it is probably the biggest flaw of the game.

There are so, so many bugs. Not unplayable bugs, but just frustrating bugs. Anyone who intends to 100% this either needs a lot of patience or just have to accept that some of the optional objectives are near impossible to finish.

The combat takes getting used to, but once you get the hang of it and the enemies, you can fluidly go from one to the other and kick ass. This game STILL has the most combat animations of any Assassin's Creed game so far. 

The DLC, Tyranny of King Washington, is sooo good. Easily in my Top 5 DLC's. I really wish the Spirit Animal stuff was implemented into the main game, along with the way Connor dresses up. Not only does it add to Connor's cool-factor, it makes the game a ton more fun. I think it also adds to the Native history of the game.

It's also probably my favorite Modern Day part of the last 4 games. Being able to travel outside the usual ""animus room"", albeit just for missions, is a lot of fun. 

All-in-all, it's a good game. Takes some getting used to. You either love it or loathe it. The remastered doesn't change much besides basically add an ENB to the game, but it makes for some pretty screenshots. Get it on sale or part of the Odyssey Season Pass and take a shot at it. 







Old review:

This is one of those games where I wish there was a meh recommendation option.

In short: This is the best way to play AC3. It still has a ton of annoying bugs (mostly visual), but the lightning does look decent and they (mostly) fixed the infamous Boston lag which made the original unplayable for me. Protip I learned from a guide: Go into the .ini and turn shadowquality to 2. It makes the game look infinitely better. For some reason it's set at 0 by default and there's no way to change it in-game. 

It still has the same faults as the original, though. Boring story. Boring protagonist that had a lot of potential to be good. They somehow made the American Frontier a boring setting (I'm Canadian so I don't know a lot of American History, hence why I was excited to explore it, and was disappointed). The game is essentially a long tutorial. Seriously, every sequence is basically just teaching you how to play the game. 

However, I'm mostly only playing it because I like the lore of the series. I'm one of those weirdos who actually like the modern day story. The ending was absolute bull, though. 

But, as I said, this is the best way to play AC3 since it fixes the unplayable Boston lag and SOME of the things that made the original even more duller than it already is. That's why I'm recommending it. 

OH, but don't buy it from here. Only get it from the AC:Odyssey season pass. At least that way you get this + stuff for Odyssey. It's not worth the $50 CAD they're asking for from here.",1578250294,1578970276,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

After I completed the game, but couldn't get 100% because of the bug, I decided to write a review for this game. I’ll write right away that I did not play in AC-3 (Assassin’s Creed 3) and I can’t compare them. Of the innovations in the game, I can say that they added (partial) control of the ship. And compared to previous parts, the schedule was also improved. The game gives out stably 60 fps per second. And on this note, the advantages of the game end! The scenery and models in the game are worse than in the previous parts. A lot of useless and unnecessary tasks, accumulative things and research. The gameplay is virtually unchanged. If you pay attention, you can notice that the game was unfinished and released as is, but the worst thing is that after the release the game remained unfinished. The fact that I was very seriously disappointed with this plot. There are so many holes and shortcomings in it that sometimes you just want to go out and delete the game to hell. And never run IT again! Before I played this game, I thought the worst of the AC series was Unity, but now I changed my mind. I advise you not to buy this game without a 90% discount and play only to complement the main plot.

[03 stupid Connors out of 10]
P.S: As for Liberation, I can say that it is better than part 3 and for the first time you play as a female character. New opportunities and rethinking of old mistakes are immediately evident. The plot here is more open and understandable, which undoubtedly pleases. Physics and animation, graphics and detailing the environment and the final 3 modes for completing tasks make this game very interesting!

Доброго тебе дня дорогой читатель! После того как я прошёл игру, но не смог пройти на все 100% из за бага, я решил написать обзор для этой игры. Сразу напишу что не играл в КУ-3 (Кредо убийцы 3) и сравнить их я не смогу. Из новшеств в игре могу сказать что добавили (частичное) управление кораблём. И по сравнению с прошлыми частями графику тоже улучшили. Игра выдает стабильно 60 фпс в сек. И на этой ноте плюсы игры заканчиваются! Декорации и модели в игре хуже чем в прошлых частях. Много бесполезных и ненужных заданий, накопительных вещей и исследований. Геймплей практически без изменений. Если обратить внимание можно заметить что игру недоделали и выпустили как есть, но самое худшое это то что после выхода игра так и осталось недоделанным. То что меня очень серьезно разочаровало это сюжет. В нём столько дыр и недочётов что иногда хочется просто выйти и удалить игру ко всем чертям. И больше никогда не запускать ЭТО! До того как я поиграл в эту игру я думал что самый худший из серии КУ это Унити но теперь поменял решение. Советую не покупать эту игру без 90% скидки и играть только для дополнение основного сюжета.

Story: 8/10

Movement: 7/10

Overall: 7/10

I'm going to start off by mentioning I have not played the original AC3, only remastered version.
One of the first things I noticed was that you can now use eagle vision while moving which was a huge annoyance in the previous games. You had to stop, put it on, and then move (in the first one you couldn't even move at all with it on). The controls had also been improved drastically and were more of a fit for the modern standards. While it means losing some of its uniqueness in that front it makes the gameplay a bit more fluid. Coming straight out of Revelations it took me a few minutes to get used to the new controls and I jumped to my death a few times because I was used to holding the spacebar for free-running which now just jumps off ledges. It does have its downsides as well - you can no longer just run without free-running. That means when you hug a corner a bit it'll start running up the wall rather than running past it. You'd have to release the running button entirely for it not to do that. Auto-follow feature from the previous game was also removed... kind of. In the real world situations it was still there when you talked to your teammates but in the Animus I didn't notice it triggering a single time. Another feature that was improved was hiding in crowds. No longer do you have to stick to pre-determined crowds for it to work - you just have to be near enough random people and you'll blend in. Another small feature that was added but I found tremendously useful and fun was the ability to weave around poles that are in the middle of small paths, meaning you didn't have to drop down, circle around, and then get back up. You just hugged the pole and did a quick turn. Synchronizing the map was made to be non-required by being able to reveal the map simply by walking on it which was a nice change of pace. Synchronization points still existed and were useful to uncover large portions of the map so you could go either route.
The character models were high quality but on some characters the hair looked a lot lower quality than the rest of the model. There were many characters with good-looking hair, even if it was a bit more advanced hairstyle yet some simple ones looked like someone had just used spray tool in Paint. The enormous difference between qualities could be seen everywhere in the game - some buildings were so ridiculously low-res that they stood out merely due to that. In some missions some characters could be missing entirely that were there only for dialogue meaning your character will carry on as if he's talking to a ghost that can't be seen nor heard. Minimap no longer has the distance indicator which was handy in ACR, and it's also misplaced a tiny bit like in AC2 which was a huge bother. In here it's only slightly thankfully but still can be an eyesore. There were also gaps in maps that let you see through it (you could see a starry sky during mid-day when you were underground and looked through one of those gaps, one particularly large), and also the interactable snow cut off in some places causing loss of immersion. Sometimes when the faces were shown up-close the eyes also looked extremely bloodshot. Conversations during walks often lasted longer than the actual walking meaning you missed out on quite a lot of chatting between the characters due to the next part of the mission triggering. Speaking of conversations - subtitles were poorly structured and timed in this game. Simply horrible. Quite often the beginning of the second sentence is put on the same line as the ending of the first even when there's multiple seconds of silence between the lines causing you to have forgotten what the first few words were when the next line finally pops up. And that's not even the worst part - a lot of the times the subtitles had their own pacing, didn't even follow the actual dialogue.
Weapon reloading was a new feature but it sometimes glitched out causing the reload bar to go up and down sporadically making sure that I avoid ranged at any cost. Health regeneration was also increased drastically meaning short fights were even less hazardous but now long fights could actually wear you down. In the long run I find it made it a bit better as it wasn't so easy to tank an army anymore. Combat itself was also a bit more technical than previous iterations meaning there were different types of enemies that took different methods to take down but the downside was that at least two of them required you to counter them to be beatable so you'd have to just stare at them and wait for them to attack to be able to do anything against them which killed the pace.
Running on rooftops that was previously a big thing in AC games is pretty useless in this one as you can't cross most streets on top of the buildings due to the streets being too wide, and in at least one occasion that I can recall it broke a mission - the game wanted me to follow someone on the street instead of roof so at one point they just started circling around until I figured out I had to go down. At that point the game disabled the controls for free-running completely. Pathfinding in general was pretty wonky causing some NPCs to just circle around aimlessly for a few rounds, then continue.
Just like the first AC game this game too had a problem that despite being an open world game it did not really feel like such. I think it's due to the aforementioned rooftop issue combined with the fact that quite often you're punished for walking around by having the guards rush you in large groups and you just end up having to waste quite a bit of time getting rid of them. The game taught you 3 methods to get rid of notoriety but the first one I never actually encountered in the entire game - ripping down wanted posters. I'm not sure if I just wasn't observative enough or if the game was bugged.
Fast travel in this one feels pretty neat because you can go to the unlocked points from anywhere instead of having to first run to a faraway fast travel location to then travel to another connected point (which wasn't really ""fast"" travel, just ""slightly faster"" travel). Map also no longer loads forever which was a refreshing experience.
A lot of fleshed out minigames felt underutilized (homestead, lockpicking, and ship sailing come to mind). Sailing did have a couple of its own missions but given how good the actual controls felt I wish there had been a little bit more. I never even bothered upgrading the ship because the missions were over before I realised and I did just fine with the base ship.
Speaking of upgrades - I didn't upgrade a single thing the entire run. The weapons felt strong enough (chain-kills to blame here), the ship didn't seem to require any upgrades, money didn't even seem to do anything so I didn't bother messing with the homestead either. In the previous games everything blended in together in a way (ACR did it the best so far, with AC2 close behind).
And finally, after many years they finally figured out skippable credits. No longer do I have to spend time making sandwiches waiting for it to end.
In summary the game felt like the most fleshed out game from the lot so far although not the best assassin simulator. The gameplay was smooth and graphics nice but it felt more like an angrier Tomb Raider than Assassin's Creed.",1578273851,1578345800,True,0,3,0,0,True,False,False

First of all I hate majority of the characters especially the main protagonist. Connor is ridiculously stupid and a hypocrite at times.. all he knows and care about is ""where is who, how do I get this, blablabla so I can kill him"". He really had no real motive against the templars and last time I checked he didn't give a sh** about the Assassin's  brotherhood either. He's nothing but a hot-headed uneducated kid from the woods. His principles are easilly swayed by people around him.. and really? Making alliances with the guy that ruined his family just because he's looking for a specific person? That's just stupid.

On the bright side, I find the graphics really good but not amazing. I understand that this is an old remastered game but the visuals hold up well in 2019 except the character models. Combat is OK and performs well in my PC.

Thus far, the game is beautiful. The graphics are beautiful and things run smoothly, no issues at all. Popped in a Xbox One controller and everything went well! 

Now content wise, whether you like to admit it or not, Assassin's Creed III brought the end of an era for Assassin's Creed games, and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag would begin to change the way Ubisoft went about this franchise. Love it or hate it (I LOVE this AC game most, it is my favorite don't @ me), it is important to the series and to see it having been remastered just really warmed my heart considering the probably.... four playthroughs and one almost fully complete 100% sync on Xbox 360 I did. I just love it. I love Connor, I LOVE Haytham, I love the story and who these characters are and I just hope that others get some joy from this game being remastered to run better and more beautifully on faster machines. 

For those of us who really loved this game (seems that's not a lot of us), it is like a present from Ubisoft to us. Anyways, is it worth $39.99? Well considering it was released originally in 2012 and this includes all DLC and the full remaster of Assassin's Creed Liberation... yeah. It is worth it. But I am biased in that area. I got it because I bought the Gold Edition of Assassin's Creed Odyssey and have loved that game too.

1. The ambient type music when you go climbing to sync the viewpoints keeps on playing and was very annoying. The original did not have that problem. The only way to ""fix"" is fast travel.
2. The assassin recruits (4 of them) don't have weapons equip and they were useless in the beginning part of the game. The only way to ""arm"" them with weapons is in sequence 9 when you purchase and craft weapons, as in ALL WEAPONS to buy and craft. Sequence 10 you will craft the last bunch of weapons and the recruits will wield the best weapons in their rank. Originally did not have this problem. This needs fixing.
3. The lighting inside the building on the character looks dull. They should add lighting effects inside the building for your character.
4. Shows rain, wind and snow effects inside the building. The original game didn't have this problem, it needs fixing.
5. The Doctor Lyle quest, the first part does not trigger the fight scene and the original had also this bug as well. Needs fixed.
Those 5 bugs are the main things that need to be addressed and fix. If they fix those 5 bugs then the game will be perfect. I'm glad they fixed the Washington Battle Sword Replica model, the original game had their models switched with Lincolns sword and the stats were fixed as well and improved. The trade economy system is improved as well, the original was hard to make money from trading. Overall I enjoyed the game.

Anyways, not sure if the game is entirely bugged or not, but the graphics in the game feel like they did in the original. Kinda disappointed in that regard, but I'm more so disappointed in that the game mechanics feel outdated and very buggy, even if it were to be released back in 2012. There are some buggy areas in cutsences where either player models or environmental details ""glitch"" out- it's not the animus itself, but just the way the textures load in. If it were me, paying the full $40 is a bit overkill at best, in the state that the game is currently in, especially considering when Assassins Creed Origins and Assassins Creed Odyssey offer much more for a cheaper price. (Got this apart of the AC Season Pass) It's a nice trip of nostalgia, although it feels like more of the original than that of a remaster with just a refresh of the graphics and free DLCs. I may change my review if the game or it's performance improves. 

Update 1: I've noticed that the graphics are mainly improved on the aspects of nature and environmental structures, like the trees and buildings. (This is after you get to the colonies) The faces are like they were at original launch, like clay. Definitely not a new game, but a fresh look into what the game would look like had it been released today.

1. The ambient type music when you go to climb to sync the viewpoints keeps on playing and was very annoying. The original did not have that problem. Only way to ""fix"" it is fast travel.
2. The assassin recruits (4 of them) don't have weapons equip and they were useless in the beginning part of the game. Only way to ""arm"" them with weapons is in sequence 9 when you purchase and craft weapons, as in ALL WEAPONS to buy and craft. Sequence 10 you will craft last bunch of weapons and the recruits will wield the best weapons in their rank. Original did not had this problem. This needs fixed.
3. The lighting inside the building on the character looks dull. They should add lighting effects inside the building for your character.
4. Shows rain, wind and snow effects inside the building. Original game didnt had this problem, needs fixed.
5. The Doctor Lyle quest, the first part does not trigger the fight scene and the original had also this bug as well. Needs fixed.
Those 5 bugs are the main things that needs to be addressed and fix. If they fix those 5 bugs then the game will be perfect. Im glad they fixed the Washington Battle Sword Replica model, original game had their models switched with Lincolns sword and the stats were fixed as well and improved.

Snow looks terrible now for one and they removed the particle effects inside of buildings that make it look just so boring. The only thing that ""updates"" the game is supporting higher resolutions.  I don't get why they did this. I received this game as a bundle in the AC: Odyssey deluxe edition and the short version is that this is not worth the money they are asking for it by any means. It is literally just AC3 and Liberation being sold to you again at near full price, for console players who maybe sold their PS3's this might make sense. But for PC players this is pathetic. Do not buy this game at full price.

Since it is literally the same game, let's set graphics aside let's take a look at what AC3 did right in the first place

- Native American protagonist, not many of those around, wish he was in a better game
- Cool setting, the reason any of us play AC games
- Tree climbing was a huge step forward at the time and no other game in the series has it baked into it's DNA like this one does. While you can climb trees in future titles there is almost never a reason to do so. This game meticulously put up paths through the trees that makes you feel like you are a master of the forest and it truly is incredible
- Board games, I wasted so much time back in the day playing these lol
- Homestead, cool evolution from the Villa in 2, your villagers all have personalities and you can do little missions to help them and level them up. Personally I found these enjoyable while not everyone does

Now let's look at what AC3 did wrong TL:DR Basically everything else lol

- Completely wasting historical events and places: the first in a very sad trend for the series, Boston Tea Party and the Midnight Ride are notable examples of tedious or downright boring missions. Made me sad at the time, and make me sad now
- Completely wasting historical characters, scratch that, characters in general: Remember when I said Connor was cool? Well the idea of him is cool. That's about it. The son of two cultures, and his mission is to kill his father and none of these ideas are explored to their full potential. I guess Ubi got scared about talking about the genocide of the Native Americans? They kind of deal with it, but it's half assed. Connor's relationship with Washington and the other revolutionaries is so forced it hurts with no development from anyone, people just magically know things they shouldn't. The script sucks, and not just Connor's story. . .
- Miles and the Future Timeline: Just. . . wow. I was one of the only people who liked the future story. I thought it was cool having a game with an A plot and a B plot and the sci-fi was neat. It wasn't necessary, we all came here for the historical setting, none of the trailers exactly advertised fucking Miles lmao. But I thought it was neat, I was interested to see how it ended after FIVE (5) GAMES OF BUILD UP. And I knew it was going to be a disaster as soon as I launched the game the first time and was greeted with the ugliest character models in the entire game. And that ending. . . woo boy it was bad. I don't want to say any more about Miles, god knows no one does. 

So in conclusion. AC3 remastered is pretty pointless. It doesn't update anything meaningful from the original besides running at modern resolutions. And at times it actually looks WORSE than the original so if you wanted a Resident Evil 2 treatment look elsewhere because this is sadly not it. I wish it was, AC3 could have been great, but like many others in the series it flopped when it came to the execution of a fantastic idea. And as anything other than a bundle with the AC: Odyssey season pass (how I got this game) it is absolutely not worth the money. Also shameful of Ubi to pull the original version from Steam if you preferred the look of the original despite the low supported resolutions.

I have a love hate relationship with this game and the reason I decided to play it was that it's included in the AC Odyssey season pass.  Maybe it's the nostalgia and my admiration for colonial America but this game is better than I remember.  Yes the faces of some characters look repugnant but besides that I'm not that upset by this remaster.  In my opinion Ubisoft is pretty scummy for hiking the price on this game so much.  I would have charged 30 dollars USD at maximum for AC3 remastered.

So why am I recommending this game despite hating Ubisoft's business decision?  The gameplay.  The combat and ship combat are incredible.  The parkour is still amazing and I love the animations when you kill a redcoat.  Sure the story is mediocre and the characters are wooden but I have a soft spot for Native American culture and this is the only major game where you can play as a Mohawk!  This definitely isn't the best AC game.  I'd say get AC2, ACB, Origins, or Odyssey if you want a game with great storytelling.  I guess my opinion here is in the minority but I'm enjoying the game now.  It's not performing badly for me.  Perhaps Ubisoft has fixed the bugs?  Who knows.  Definitely get this through the Odyssey season pass if you want to buy this game.  You'll get more content for the 20 dollars.",1571603877,1571603877,True,5,2,0.544127166271209717,0,True,False,False

In length: Do you remember Dark souls remastered? For those who don't, when that title received its ""definitive version"" people weren't too thrilled since the graphical side was pretty much the same as the original and only thing getting a significant uplift was the performance. Simply put, the game ran better. In contrast Assassin's creed 3 remastered is the polar opposite. Both of the games included have improved textures and lighting for sure, but they run just as bad or even worse than the originals. The AI could have spent some time in the oven as well.
When playing through AC3 remastered I have faced several bugs, these include but are not limited to: some times when corpse hits the ground it does its best impression of octodad entering lightspeed quite literally flipping around with elongated limbs till it disappears completely, during one assassination mission all 4 targets spawned (partly or fully) inside structures some of them could be killed only with explosives that luckily ignore the colliders. Now remember that AI, here's the case. I climbed high to a mast and shot a redcoat to a shoulder with an arrow. Not only did the arrow bounce away (yes that happens every time you shoot with a bow), but the redcoat just went about his business as normal... How? How am I supposed to feel immersed being an assassin when wounding an enemy does not even get their attention?
A little word on Assassin's creed liberation remastered. This was my major concern being the unhappy owner of the Assassin's creed liberation HD which ran like ant in sub-zero temperature. The code was not optimized for PC at all. And to your surprise it still is not. My rig (I7-6700, GTX 1080ti, 16g RAM) can just barely hold onto that 70 fps cap when maxed out in 4K.

I'd say 80% of the movement is fluid and then you find yourself disco dancing on a 2 foot rock for over a minute. Or climbing a large tree and jumping to a branch...nope, you just broke your neck. Peace be with you. The weather system is introduced as well and the changing seasons are a nice visual touch but not really game altering. I suppose they are not meant to be but it seems like sneaking around in a heavy rainstorm would be easier. Running in snow is certainly more difficult. But no, npc's and enemies keep to their paths no matter the weather. Maybe colonials enjoyed thunderstorms(free baths). Hard to say. The DLC is a mixed bag as well. Freedom's Cry is more of the same, which is okay but not great. Tyranny is just....ugh. Basically, you turn into spirit animals. Yeah. It's so against the grain of the main content that I thought I was playing a bootleg version before I finally quit. 

The story is there as well. Putting you amid historical American figures was an interesting choice but hey, Ezio use to buddy up to Da Vinci so that kinda falls in line with the series. I will applaud the level of work that the historians who build these games put in. It's fictional, yet you can learn a lot about people and places in history.

- The side objectives became buggier, an example being the [spoiler] Boston tea destruction mission [/spoiler] where there is a less than six firearms usage allowed and strangely each usage counted as two instead one thereby failing the side objective. Bad for perfectionists.
- The parkour/free-running is more clunky making harder to outrun your enemies especially on trees and sometimes not jumping to the location you desire.
- This is a personal opinion but Ubisoft should use the old weapon wheel( or whatever it is).

Originally released in 2012, Assassin's Creed III has been known as, arguably, the weakest release of the entire series. That's why it came as a pretty big surprise when Ubisoft announced the Remastered version alongside Assassin's Creed: Odyssey. With that said, this fifth-but-named-third entry into the franchise isn't completely undeserved, as the original had a lot of problems that centered around its mechanics, as well as an overwhelming amount of frustrating glitches. Let's take a look and see what has changed with this version while keeping in mind this is a Remaster and NOT a Remake.

Included in the base game is also the DLC, The Tyranny of King Washington, along with the previous standalone mini spin-off, Assassin's Creed: Liberation. These have both of course received the same audio, visual, and mechanic upgrades as the base game, and it's nice that it's all been wrapped up and included in one Remastered release. It's nice to know what you're getting for your money, and suffice it to say you're getting two full games. With that said, the amount of content is not enough to justify the price, given that there are so few improvements and so many issues left untouched. Let's go ahead and focus on the good first.

Well, first up the crafting system has been modified. It's now more essential than ever to do the Homestead Missions to upgrade your crafters, as you can now craft your own weapons instead of having to rely on purchasing them. Recipes can now be found in the chests scattered throughout Boston and New York, but not all of the chests are available from the get-go. There are also little tweaks to the mini-map that allow you to see which direction an enemy is facing, which helps a lot with combat and stealth. Shortcuts and haystacks are now also shown.

Speaking of stealth, hiding in bushes and whistling is now a thing; thank the gaming gods. This wasn't initially introduced until Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, but boy does it make a difference with trying to 100% synchronize the main DNA sequence. It also helps a lot with hunting, as you can now just toss some bait out and wait for an animal to come close to the bushes so you can assassinate it right from stealth. The assassin blades are also automatically equipped for stealth assassinations now, rather than having to remember to manually switch back to them before sneaking up behind a guard and stabbing him. Additionally, Connor now wields the dual-assassination gloves created by Leonardo Da Vinci in Assassin's Creed II so double kills without going into glaringly high notoriety are a thing in the Remastered version.

And now for the bad. This review may make it seem like there isn't as much bad as there is good with Assassin's Creed III Remastered, but that's not the case. There's simply too much that's still wrong with this title to even type out effectively. Everything that was wrong with the original game is still there, aside from extremely minor tweaks to the parkour system. Connor still wants to run up every wall he barely grazes past, he's still far too jumpy, characters still glitch through the floor, the optimization is still horrid beyond recognition, half the time the lips don't even sync up with what the characters are saying, dialogue lines during cutscenes glitch out and just don't get said and it's only by having subtitles on that it's apparent a character has even said anything at all. It's just on and on, and it's obvious that Ubisoft didn't really give much of a crap about improving this title one way or another, except for subtle superficial tweaks.

Why Ubisoft wasted their time remastering Assassin's Creed III and not the very first Assassin's Creed is beyond me. This title surely didn't need a remaster, though the niche audience that absolutely screams this title's praises from the mountaintop are definitely over the moon about it. Despite including Assassin's Creed: Liberation and The Tyranny of King Washington, there's no way on Earth that this Remaster is worth $49.99 CAD. If you received it through the Season Pass from Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, then it might not be so bad. Otherwise, steer clear until at least a 50-75% off sale unless you're really desperate to play the game.

The only difference between this game and the one before seems only to be the textures, which could have just been done with a update. All this game does is stick a new pricetag, for the same thing but shinier. This game is only worth it if you were going to buy the Odyssey season pass anyway.

The good parts about this game is that the setting is really good and the time period is super interesting. The bad part is that alot of it is kinda ruined by the okayish story. It is too short and alot of the actual development is cut out, and Connor just has all the wild changes without any filler. 

There are beyond a few issues with this game:
Terrible UI that doesn't seem to have been updated
Controls are janky
Connor and his love at jumping at every object higher than his shin
Combat is just pressing 'B' to parry or just running away
Doing anything other than the mainquests is only for personal accomplishment as they haven't even added achievements.
Every time i am in a city, all the grass in between the pavements turns into pure black textures

This game feels like a £15, not £34.

While playing as Haytham, there is not much to do other than slogging through the main quest (and OMG I suck at stealth missions but what else is new???). Even though it is technically free content, it does not feel as satisfying to me. I hope the devs condense Haytham's part of the game or at least add in side missions in between main store quests. 

I definitely love Ziio though. She is THE queen.

A lot of comments here mention bugs. So far, the worst I've encountered is not really game breaking; it's an audio glitch occurring outside the animus. 

On its own, I probably won't buy it, hence the thumbs down. However, since this came with the Odyssey season pass, I don't really have a reason to hate it. I will finish playing and uninstall to make room for other games.


EDIT: The EYES. THOSE soulless eyes curse my existence. Why does every character look like badly done taxidermy project? Also, the horse and the Aquila are hard to maneuver.

I won't say it's the best remaster I've seen, but most of the other reviews I've seen were being way harsher than I expected (one said that the combat system's changed and has added a ""delay""? Not in my save file, no). However, now AC3:Remastered won't even launch to its main screen; all I see is a black screen and I've spent a little bit of time troubleshooting on the internet. I realized from other people's posts that this black screen issue is actually quite common which annoys me to no end considering this is a remaster, after all. So anyway, I can't play the game anymore because it doesn't go past the black screen. The time I had with it was pretty decent; the lighting is much better now but is also so bright that it exposes how ugly the models and engine are: everyone looks plastic, but I guess they at least get some good lighting now.

 The remastered Liberation was actually decent considering its basically an updated port, but it still feels a lot like a PSP game at times.The dialogue in Liberation is god awful; I've written better lines in high school drama class.  All in all, wouldn't recommend because the bug/issue I encountered in AC3 was definitely game-breaking and I still can't get it to work. Sorry Ubisoft, get your stuff together.

Edit as of 7/24/19: Seems like Ubisoft managed to patch whatever was causing the black screen of death bug. I'll admit I didn't have much hope but props to Ubisoft. I now go back to my original opinion of the game: the remaster might not warrant full price because the improved lighting is a double-edged sword with how plastic character models now seem and the additional improvements may or may not seem all that great to you (such as a reskinned HUD). I do think the game is worth purchase even if it isn't the best entry in the series because when AC3 shines during those rare moments, it really shines.",1562532928,1564019783,True,0,0,0.52173912525177002,2,True,False,False

+ Story is nice
+ Haytham
+ Desmond missions were pretty fun and offered variety
+ Templars had their unique personalities
+/- Connor is pretty badass, but has no personality

- After being spoiled with Ezio, Connor feels often pretty boring
- A lot of bugs
- Some of the characters look worse than in the original game (Haytham looks like a wax doll)
- Too high of a price for the game, but I got it for free with the Odyssey season pass

All in all, I enjoyed the game more than I thought I would. It is clearly not as good as the Ezio games, but it's very enjoyable. Comparing to the price I wouldn't recommend buying it without sale, but if we are judging the game, yes I would recommend it.

So they decided to remaster this game and put the price of the game to £34 and remove the original assassins creed 3 from the steam store, why you might ask they removed the original version of this game..... BC this version of the game is an absolute joke and for people wanting to play this Assassins creed, you are forced to buy this piece of REMASTERED trash on steam so that you cant tell the difference of how much they Fu**ed up. 1. yes the graphics look a little bit better and they made the combat a little bit more smoother with a few extra combos but it comes with random ais changing colour, not following speech patterns and randomly walking away mid conversation during a mission and you will fail bc ""WARNING REDUCE DISTANCE TO TARGET""
 2. i have never experienced this problem until i got the REMASTERED version, jumping off buildings, walls and my own horse occasionally led me to fall through the map, get caught on objects and in general crash. THANKS UBI for this one!! I know that not everyone likes this assassins creed but as a massive fan of this series of games i just had to play this one too. let down massively.

The only way i would recommend assassins creed 3 is if they brought back the original version to steam again. Unfortunately this REMASTER is a solid 3/10 for me. Ruined assassins creed 3 for me and i dont think ill ever buy a remastered assassins creed again (especially not after the failure of assassins creed 2s remaster)

Not sure why we are having only 25% off now during the summer sale. Currently, the game goes for 30 EUR while I purchased it for 10 EUR only a couple of months ago. Price is the main selling point here since gameplay-wise not much has changed. 

For 10 EUR picking a remastered version with all DLCs included (plus Liberation) is certainly a good deal. As for Liberation: while AC 3 (the regular version) is completely absent from the Steam Store Liberation can still be found - it's 20 EUR without any discount affecting it. In terms of expenditure buying the remastered version is definitely worth it. What about the other aspects of the game?

[b]Updated graphics[/b] 

There are some very detailed comparison videos on Tube showing the visual enhancements done to the game. Lighting, shadows and water reflection make it more beautiful. Some say it gives a different look to the game artistically speaking which is a problem - I'm not sure how it can be a deterring factor. I can only see advantages here. Daylight hunting is amazing now thanks to the improved lighting - I spent a lot of time with collecting extra pelts just for the immersion.

[b]Redundancy Vs Nostalgia[/b] 

And a lot of other things haven't changed. We can still stuck at certain objects which means Connor simply runs / jumps upwards but falling back. Close to an enemy outpost enemy soldiers kept respawning and attacking me: with the ""old"" counter-based system it was easy to eliminate dozens of them. I was thinking of taking a screenshot as bodies were piling up on the screen and it, frankly, looked ridiculous. 

Notifications given by the Animus system are WAY too many. Sending caravans to the different locations is still very annoying and I still see no point in having a tunnel system as without it we still have enough fast-travel locations positioned very well on each map. The system of picking primary weapons and secondary items could have used a revamp. I understand whistling was picked up from Black Sail which helps getting rid of annoying patrols.

Story remains the same, naturally. It's still weird playing a prologue (= missions with Haytham) for 4-5 hours before we can finally get to know Connor. Back then it was such a letdown for me as Ezio was way more interesting while Connor is simply too stubborn a hero. I had the opportunity to play Liberation and the Washington DLCs so all in all I was satisfied with the game. I do believe, however, that it can only be recommended to those who love the AC series, in general, and they were also very fond of this episode in the first place. I still believe it is a mediocre entry in the series but I had good fun with it before moving on to completing Odyssey.

From Day one itself the so called Remastered had given me several issues. One of the major issue are 

- Screen Flickering 
( If you want to play need to change Full screen too Windowed or Borderless. Else sit back and enjoy the never ending flickering fun in every 10 sec )

- Integrated graphics card 
( The game App.exe  is default set into your integrated graphics card need to change in order to play ) 

-  Animation 
( The Character models facial quality was terrible along with some annoying white wash shades )

- Price 
( I got it along with AC odyssey S pass but the current price point they are selling this MOD AC3 is not at all acceptable)

The only Pros which i felt while playing this Mod is some 7 year old memories but that you can still get by Re-installing your Original AC3 . Rather than wasting money for this crap!

TLDR:
Get the original even it you have to get it from a 3rd party site because this version is trash.

1, The story is a bunch of disjointed nonsense which is nothing more then boring and all i keep thinking is god sake i wish they would shut up.

2, The music is terrible and does not fit the game at all, i have to mute it because it gives me a headache. 

3, There are so many bugs i don't think i can list them all... in a few hours i have seen people stuck in the floor, horses vanish and appear in front of me, objects that have physics go bonkers especially in the cut scenes, people despawn and respawn right in front of me, People driving the horse and karts have no reigns to control the horses, if you restart a checkpoint the guns are empty and you have to reload them, nobody has footprints even in the snow, the player looks like hes going to fall over when walking upstairs because the animation is broken... there are literally too many bugs to count.

4, The combat is the worst i have seen in a game for a VERY long time, it has no flow like the other assassin creed games, it's clunky and people just don't move in a natural way at all.

5, The stealth is totally broken and it seems that it's scripted unlike the previous games.

6, The worst thing of all is the animations. I don't even know where to start with this one, it's just so bad.... that I can not play this game, Watch a YouTube video or something and see for yourself, they look like a bunch of drunken clowns who's blind and wearing roller skates. 

7, They changed the controls. Why? they worked great before! this new way of block/parry just does not work. The controls also have a delay which makes it hard to do anything other then get hit. The original Assassin's Creed 3 game has no delay in the controls i just checked.

8, Guns... They ruin the game and they are just a pain in the ass and serve no real purpose other then to get on your nerves. They also have a range of less then 20 metres... seriously... i shot someone which was about 2 horse and carts in distance and there was no reaction at all. 

On the plus side it does look pretty damn good even though they did not upgrade the polygon count at all, so a lot of objects look blocky and a lot of the MAIN Npc's faces are so badly drawn they literally look like punch and judy characters. The original only looks a little aged compared to this anyway ans the faces look FAR better because they do not look like melted plastic. 

I am glad i got it for free because if i paid for this crap i would be really upset to say the least.

This ""remaster"" came out in March 2019 and all they did was playing with some of the lighting and cutting some of the cutscenes shorter which makes the story even more dull and hard to understand.

They LITERALLY cut some scenes in first missions to rid of boredom but that did not help it at all but make it so that it doesn't make sense anymore.

Such a good game for it's time (2012) but this isn't the remaster it deserves.

P.S: Boston LAG is still there, optimization sucks and you get around 30 FPS in Boston if you're lucky, wtf is this shét.

Shame on you Bugisoft.

Personally it was one of my fav games on the entire saga, i the only reason i m buying it, is because i never played the season pass content. I must say i am really suprised. I remember playing this game on release, and there were tons of side quests to do, and with the season pass? even more.

I m glad ubisoft made this remastered, is good to play a game where collectibles were not useless, where making every quest would give you the feeling of achieving something. I would not call this a remastered, smart move by ubisoft, this is no more than a reshade, could do that myself, but well, it looks good. The lighting have been improved, some mechanics like aiming with a bow or pistol, UI has been improved. I think faces are a bit worse, but nothing of special.

I appreciate Ubisoft for releasing it with season pass and liberation included, never thought 9.99 would give me so much pleasure. I loved Connor and i still love it. Replaying the homestead missions and naval ones is amazing. Never understood the hate for AS III in 2012, and i still don't. This game is awesome, and it is still awesome. Ubisoft did choose a smart setting, the American Revolution. Ubisoft used to know how to make makes, and this is the proof. Chests with weapons and outfits, collectibles with rewarding items behind it, side activities with impact in the world, and the same brutal combat, with the amazing Tomahawk and the amazing connor outfit, that for me, are both the best in the saga.

For me is one of the best assassins creed games ever made, recommend everyone the Remastered Edition, (on sale) would not pay 40€ for it, not worth it, because the improvements are very few compared to the first game.

The textures of both games have been upped in resolution, and the character models...well, they look shiny. Whether that was intentional of not, I couldn't say for sure.

I didn't have much gameplay trouble in the main game beyond seeing something I think would be climbable (coming off Origins and Odyssey) and not being able to climb it, and the occasional failing of a mission due to something I couldn't control (though that may be user error).

Liberation is always finding one way or another to crash on me. Be it trying to enter/exit the Map, use the Steam overlay's web browser for collectible maps, or just for no reason at all. Considering this is the packed-in Remastered Edition of a PC Port of a Playstation Vita game, that actually makes a bit of sense. A relaunch after a crash will help, but I'm sad that it crashes at all.

I still feel like I'm owed a refund, though. Here's a list of what went wrong in the half hour I spent... trying, to play the game.

1. The game got upset when I tried to up the graphics, started spazzing out both of my displays, causing them to go black, causing the contents of the display to be shoved off the side, and so on in seizure like spasms. Apparently the game doesn't like dual monitors. Duly noted.

2. Desmonds still kinda funny looking. Not really a remastered problem, but I feel like it's worth noting. I had to fight the game to shut down after the dual monitor incident, however. It apparently doesn't like tabbing out very much.

3. Hey, I can pause cutscenes-- oh, now my keyboard doesn't work. I managed to force the game to shutdown, then tried again.

Cons:
*Graphic Boost means you need a stronger machine (I don't have that, so I have to drop the resolution)

As remasters go (and I've played the original game A LOT), this is well done. Graphics aside, the settings and controls have been simplified to a point it's actually fantastic. The shooting mechanics were ridiculous compared to other AC titles in this game, and how they actually work. Aim and shoot, not hold an release (except for the ship combat). The environments and textures do look better, crisper, and it's just fun to play.

The endlessly long intro sequence is still there, and annoying as ever, but it says a lot about a game when you're willing to sit through the tediousness of such a long introduction a few times over to play a game. If you know this game, it's worth replaying this way, if you've never played AC III, now is the time, even if you buy it separately, because given the original price with all the DLCs, this is value for money, even if the size of the download has more than doubled.

People complaining about the looks of characters etc., consider the game's age. If this were a reMAKE, I would understand, but it's a reMASTER. It's meant to look a bit better, make it more accessible and offer a more complete game experience. All of this the AC III Remaster does.

The crappy business practice of recycling the same game for more money with virtually no improvements deserves a low rating which it apparently has. However, it's getting a positive rating from me solely on the merit of the game itself.  But, buy it on sale.  This isn't remastered in any form.

Ironically, I had been playing AC3 the week prior to the release of AC3 remaster paired with Odyssey (a game that, at the time, I had not yet played).  So, I bought Odyssey and scored a copy of a game I was already playing anyway.  That said, I essentially played the game twice side by side as a direct comparison.  There were zero noticeable changes from the original to the remaster.  Frankly, this title does not deserve the notion of having been remastered.  It's a tactic to make an old game expensive again.  That said, I got it paired with another purchase. So, Ubi, thanks I guess.  Now I have two copies of the same thing.

For those that are just interested in this title, however, the game in and of itself is not bad.  The reviews reflect more of a general dissatisfaction of a clear cash grab scheme and, therefore, the reviews reflect poorly on poor business practices.  For my review of the game and because they are essentially the same anyway, I defer to my original AC3 review:

Best of the pre-rpg style assassin's creed games. I really like the ambiance, the story, and the gameplay changes made from the Ezio line. Really got the series started on ship combat which has since produced Black Flag and the upcoming Skull n Bones. Great progression of gameplay and style of the series.

This game is an absolute disgrace of a remaster. What on earth was Ubisoft thinking this was even remotely close to being re-released again? I fell through the ground 3 times, was run over by a British soldier until I died, and a target I was supposed to kill was apparently stuck in the floor. Bugs to no end. Often times at the title screen the game will fail to even boot up the menu. It will load up a black screen about 30% of the time which forces a restart.

The graphics are an insult to what is considered ""remastered."" Characters look like wax figurines and there's always this weird filter around multiple locations. Haytham's eyebrows are non-existent. Music bugs out when you climb a synchronization point and keeps replaying the music over and over again until you force restart.  Combat music is way louder with this strange gain every time you leap into battle. Battles are buggy and combat works only when it feels like it.

Ubisoft re-sells you a game for $40 after slapping a cheap SweetFX filter, and it looks worse! How long has it been since they've made a good game?

I wish I could like this. As it stands, it is a buggy tragedy and to even consider buying this de-master is a joke. I got this for free, but it is so bad I want to return it.

The good thing is that I got this game from the AC: Odyssey Ultimate Edition completely free and, all things considered, it was not a bad deal at all to get two (three, depending your point of view) full games for the price of one. Furthermore, I never got to play any of the original game DLC's, so now I'll finally be able to.
Unfortunately, if you're interested in buying it, it's not worth it. At least, not with a full price, of course. If you, like me, got it for free, I guess there's not much to complain, right?
Let's go with some [u]upsides[/u]:
- The gameplay was overhauled to make it easier (and more similar to nowadays titles) for newcomers. Now, there's free aim with the right mouse button (although the targeting system is not particularly good) and freerun is done with shift, which makes it simpler than before, as Connor's parkour is more easily handled.
- Some sound effects have been changed. The storms are incredibly pleasant to listen to. HOWEVER, sounds are not consistent. The music played while in conflict sounds louder or quieter randomly for no particular reason. One moment you can barely listen it, then you go deaf.
Now, some [u]mixed[/u] (that can be good or bad depending your point of view)
- The HUD and map has been changed as well. I found it nice, though I'm not particularly fond of the yellow/gold choice of colour.
- A lot of secondary objectives from missions and side-missions have been simplified or removed altogether, which I found pretty annoying.
- The game can run in pretty much any system. I have an old toaster and I'm able to get an average of 45 FPS almost at max settings. There aren't any noticeable improvements, sadly, and the game looks pretty much the same as before. Some facial animations, skin textures and lighting effects seem off and don't always work properly.
- The multiplayer was removed. I just tried it once or twice and could hardly find a game to join (I might have bought the original AC 3 a little late and the multiplayer, at least in my region, was pretty much dead), so it's not something I'm going to miss. Nevertheless, it might be unacceptable to those who played it and loved it, considering that the original game was removed from stores.
EDIT: I also noticed that there's a ridiculous amount of animals around and that pretty much breaks the economy of the game. I found myself having more money that I'd ever need very early in the game. Beaver pelts are ridiculously profitable if sold to the right person, not to mention bears.
Now, the [u]downsides[/u].
- I have been getting a lot of random hard crashes. I lost count after the tenth one. I couldn't find a reason that might cause them and I don't know if somebody else had the same problem as me.
- I have also been getting some freezes. The game freezes for 4 or 5 seconds (sometimes more) while the audio keeps playing. Some of those freezes then lead to the aforementioned hard crashes. Sometimes they happen every half an hour more or less. Though, there have been times in which I did not get any for some hours. I suspect that both the crashes and the freezes have something to do with the autosave system. Fortunately, I have not lost anything so far, despite how many crashes I've experienced.
- A lot of people had problems with screen flickering and it's likely that you will too, unless Ubisoft patches the problem.
- As mentioned before, there are some lighting issues from time to time and, of course, glitches. I haven't found any game-breaking one (thankfully), but some of them can be pretty annoying. Specially when the attack prompt does not appear over enemies and their attacks are unblockable.

So, to sum up, should you buy this game? Probably not. If you never played AC 3 (or Liberation), I'd advise you to wait for a sale (let that 75% discount come). Otherwise, the game in its current state is hardly worth it, specially at THAT price.

EDIT: As of April 26, I have finally finished AC: Liberation. I've yet to unlock ONE achievement (the 100% sync one) because there's a mission that crashes at a checkpoint when I'm trying to replay it. Plus, the last few missions were a complete chore due to the buggy combat in which you wouldn't even get an attack prompt to counter. Furthermore, the game somehow started working worse since Ubi released a ""patch"" about a week ago. I have no idea how they could have screwed that, honestly.
As for the graphics, same ol' same ol'. I can't notice a clear difference between Liberation HD and Liberation Remaster.
The story is okay and you must bear in mind that this was a PS Vita port, so I'd say they did a pretty good job at it.
Still, my opinion stands that you shouldn't buy it unless there's a ridiculously low discount (+75%) or, of course, you got it from the AC: Odyssey season pass.",1554308303,1556298757,False,45,0,0.72548753023147583,5,True,True,False

[h1][i](by the way, there's a ""TL;DR"" at the bottom)[/i][/h1]

Now then, the game is very well optimized, running much smoother than the original version, and yet there are people here with twice the power of my own gaming rig [i](or even more)[/i] who complain about the game not starting or about its alleged poor performance [i](and other absurd issues that I have not encountered)[/i] while I'm getting between 40fps and 60fps at 1080p and all settings maxed out with what is [b]AT BEST[/b] a modest, ""old-gen"" PC...so since all this hate and the almost 1000 negative reviews make no sense whatsoever, I can only surmise that the people who wrote them:

- have no idea what they're talking about but love to troll around
- have it in for Ubisoft and are taking it out on this game even though they're frustrated by an entirely different title given to them by said company
- might be stuck at a ""I only know how to create a new folder""-level where the problem is obviously the user
- were probably expecting some nonsense like a game with graphics such as ""Odyssey"" and whatnot
- simply don't like the price at which the game is being sold [b]EVEN THOUGH, AGAIN,[/b] it's a very well optimized remaster of an already incredible game that came out 7 years ago [b]AND[/b] also includes ""Assassin's Creed: Liberation""
- or they aren't too pleased with the new overall character models [i](which, if I'm being honest, could be [b]THE ONLY[/b] negative aspect about this remaster [b]AS WELL AS[/b] technically the only logical explanation as to why everyone is so angry...but it's still [b]DEFINITELY[/b] not a deal-breaker nor does it have a big impact on the overall immersion)[/i]

By the way, do you remember the whole Boston debacle at the game's original launch in 2012? When people were complaining about the horrible framerate and stuttering upon arriving at the docks? Well that issue, among many others which are still unresolved in the original game, has been dealt with in this remaster, along with many other fixes.



[h1][b]TL;DR?[/b][/h1]

Personally, I got it for free since I own the ""Assassin's Creed: Odyssey"" Season Pass, but that changes nothing because even at its current price, it's still worth it for what it has to offer, namely a combination of stability, great performance, enhanced graphics [i](which bring its gorgeous world to life significantly better than its predecessor)[/i], awesome new gameplay mechanics and more, all neatly embedded into a vibrant remaster of one of the best and most beautiful games ever created.

One can only hope that they'll do the same with ""Black Flag"" in the near future, or maybe with the whole series up until ""Unity"".

So yeah - well done, Ubisoft! Exceptional job! [i][b](the same goes for ""Liberation"")[/b][/i]

I honestly feel that the shit heads don't like this game because it showcases the atrocities committed by the British ""Americans"" as they orchestrated mass genocide on Native Americans, then white washed the facts from this painful time in American History. Some of these people who are bombing this game are the offspring of those very slave-mentality filled, hate driven individuals. Furthermore, Benjamin Franklin is a thief.

Onto the review: Assassin's Creed 3 completes the Desmond story along with wrapping up the ""2012 doomsday"" scenario that was socially popular with the ""end of the Mayan calendar"". I thoroughly enjoyed this my first time on Xbox 360 and the remastered runs well and without any serious, noteworthy problems. As far as the American Revolution segments go, I loved the early twist with Haytham and his allegiance with the Templar order. This gave me a real motivating factor once it transitioned to Connor (Ratohnhaketon). I enjoyed the focus being from the Native American perspective and how Connor weaved his way through the American Revolution. As in all AC games, you meet popular figures during the period and assassinate your way through the invading British fleet. Combat is fluid, with a lot of different weapon options and the ability to be stealthy or do a more front-facing approach. Hunting is a fun and intuitive component that can fill any completionist's desires. I felt a sense of closure with the ending and for me, it was a good thing. 

The DLC is an interesting take on George Washington and a lesson in how easy someone can fall to tyrannical thinking (you know who I'm talking about). They showcase the slow but seamless transition as Washington loses his sight on the values of the Constitution (but they owned slaves, so there is that), and falls to the power of the apple.

NPCs popping out of nowhere mid cutscene (This is a common thing, but strangely it happened to me almost on EVERY ocassion) , the synch theme getting stuck almost everytime and various other bugs that remind you every second, why you shouldn't have bought this game.

The deal breaker for me was the controls. They changed the scheme, you have to use your only 4 quick slots to allocate ALL your weapons and items. Leading you to pause the game every 30 seconds.

I wanted to change some controls for the boat (Because they screwed that too), only to find that whenever you change a key for your boat, it does the same for the character, EVEN if they have separated menus...

While I do appreciate that SOME quality of life things were added, the 'new' textures feel so lazily put together it's a slap to the face to the people who played this when it first came out. It's upsetting and ultimately somewhat scummy to not disclose in advance that the multiplayer would not be making a return as it was probably one of the best parts about this game. Obviously I'm still going to play through this mess, as I never got to 100% it on console, but I'm going to be extremely sad doing so, since with many comparisons, the game looked far better in 2012 than 7 years in the future apparently. I think one of the most frustrating things about this remaster, is that I want to like it, I want to genuinely say that Ubisoft did something right to the fans of the series, this being the first and only AC game I've ever played. Yet to charge 40 dollars for something that hardly looks any prettier let alone polished is just an outright sadness I don't quite have the words for. The worst part of it all, is that the original version of this game is no longer able to be purchased on steam, giving us this sham in its place. The only reason I don't feel ripped off entirely, is that I managed to get this for free from a season pass, but I can't say I'm too eager to support Ubisoft for much longer if this is the product they deliver after having 7 years to impress us.

However it had some major issues such as freezing and other small bugs. Despite this the action was greatly exciting, this was needed due to the game being more of a brawler than most of the other games. Even though it was all fun and good the world did seem kind of bland and colorless looking back on it. The remaster completely fixed that though, I haven't binge played a game to this level in years. I played around 50 hours in the first week. Some mechanics have even been improved such as better low profile assassinations and using the hidden blades automatically rather than having to switch all the time. I also really liked the new weapon wheel, having to switch to weapons that weren't on the quick select felt better as it felt more like a time stop rather than a menu. Free-aiming as a great addition as well due to the awkward aiming in the original. 

Overall I had a great experience with this game and in my 50 hours so far I have 90% synchronization in the main game.
If you haven't played the original I recommend just playing this new version of the game, it just provides a better experience.
I give this game a 9/10.

-Soldiers are not visible on the map, so that you think the area/fort is clear while a row of soldiers is loading their guns behind you. 
- Stuck in booth, building, bush, tree, rock at least 8 times within 10 hours. Restart neccessary, success lost.

This section of the review covers the changes and or upgrades made to the remaster
Pros:
-Lighting engine looks gorgeous (most of the time)
-Revamped combat that gives the player more freedom
-Up-scaled rendering and overall solid port

Cons:
-Broken Face lighting and skin quality on some of the models in the game are very ugly
-Little to no attention paid to grammatical errors
-There is one side objective in a level that is nearly impossible and after further review it appears that whoever made the game did not actually go back through main missions or do much trial testing.
-Nothing impressive enough to even warrant the ""remastered"" in the title.

do yourself a favor and play the Original AC III instead.

Soundtrack, cinematic cutscenes and Gameplay are the only positive factors on AC III at least for me, since Ubi screwed up storyline ending when they see potential money-making-franchise and released it annually right until AC Syndicate.

Terribly shame it was turned into experimental RPG Mechanics game, different team producer, and different OST composer after AC III, which won't be able to keep up promise on 2007 ""We will making it Trilogy Game"" and maintained cliffhanging ending since AC III and later on.

Same game , some improvements, especially in the interface. Nice if you haven't played the original, I guess.

The Liberation-part is stil crapola on a stick afa controls go. Rage-inducing 'sudden' lag, terrible quick-time stuff. Horrible keyboard controls. Especially the bayou-levels suffer from the absolutely atrocious controls. Expect many rage-quits because the character refuses to climb the simplest stuff, or jumps exáctly where she shouldn't jump.

As a historian the colonial setting grabbed me. while the main character was bland everything else from the setting to the naval combat and the supporting characters made the game great. It has only improved with the remaster and i, personally enjoy it far more than odyssey (though getting back to the old block to win combat was a challenge). The graphics and lighting have improved to make the setting much better to look at, stealth has improved allowing you to whistle from stalking zones and double assassinate on low profile, and they even added free aiming. I have yet to play liberation and honestly wont be doing so for a while as i was only interested in AC3 but maybe ill give it a look when im curious enough. Now some misteps of the game is even though there has been improvements in the graphics i still see many glitches from dissapearing textures to npcs spazzing out of control. while it was funny thats something i shouldnt be seeing in a remastered game especially when its constant. the last mistep is the price. while i got it for free with the dlc, some people who haven't think 40 dollars is a bit much and i agree. maybe 30 dollars should've been the price. What i dont agree with is telling people not to buy it because of the price alone and they let the price cloud their judgement on the rest of the game.

Edit: the blinking bug went away :) hurray! however there are lots of other bugs that i have discovered. too many to even put here. none of these are gamebreaking glitches, but it is something to note. an example would be every now and then a wanted poster on the wall i cannot interact with. annoying but doesn't completely ruin the game or anything.

- GeForce GTX 1050
- Intel i7 7700HQ CPU @ 2,80Ghz
- 8 GB RAM
- capable of 60 fps on 1920 x 1080 resolution

It has run AC Rogue, AC Syndicate, AC Origins, AC Odyssey, TERA, and the more graphically-demanding FFXV Windows Edition on high settings with no significant fps issues, even with anti-aliasing turned on. Yet, I cannot say the same for AC 3 Remastered despite my initial enthusiasm towards playing this game. It suffers from severe fps latency and poor dialogue synchronization at my default high settings, and even when at their lowest, it still can't run at 40 fps smoothly, not to mention the occasional screen flickering and whiteout (to my utter dismay, it occured when Connor axed the pillar during his declaration of war).

I encountered a similar issue of fps stutters when I first played through Yakuza 0, and most recently Yakuza Kiwami. In fact, it was way worse when I was playing the latter (I could barely move Kiryu Kazuma even when asked to follow an NPC), so much so I had to tone down the rendering before gameplay became more tolerable. But ever since Sega released a series of patches for these two Yakuza games, my GeForce Experience automatically optimized these two Japanese beat-em-ups to, of all settings I could fathom, ULTRA and it ran so smoothly and perfectly I had to up my ante with my reflexes in combat and rhythm minigames.

Granted the recommended settings for the two Yakuza games are at least half of what is needed for FFXV or the more recent AC games. But the point is, (Ubisoft, if you are reading the reviews on Steam at all) I feel AC 3 needs a serious patch to address these graphical and performance hiccups, just like what Sega did for the PC releases of Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami. There is no point beautifying an older game or making it easier to play if the final product can't be played smoothly at all, because I still encounter fps stutters whenever I move Connor around the field even at LOWEST graphical settings with anti-aliasing turned off, just like how it was with the two Yakuza games prior them being patched.

Until this performance issue has been addressed, I neither see lots of positive reviews coming from the AC community, nor likely recommend this 'remastered' to anyone in the near future.",1554375899,1554375899,False,1,0,0.424505561590194702,0,True,True,False

And while the graphics look a lot nicer, almost everything else feels like a downgrade. Combat feels more clunky due either a design decision or a bug (not sure which) where the enemy counter icons flash much later than the original, meaning you probably have to press the counter button before the icon actually flashes in order for it to work, and playing with the UI off actually feels easier than having it on and constantly having to ignore the icon and go with the enemies attack animation instead. The AI also seems more buggy and glitchy and i've had enemies detect me, only for them to walk around randomly while the combat music is playing even thought they don't attack. There also seems to be many issues with the music, with the ambient ""music"" that plays when you are on top of a viewpoint getting bugged and stuck on loop for the rest of the game, and reloading the game will fix it but its only a matter of minutes before it bugs again. The combat music in the frontier is also bugged and appears to constantly repeat certain parts of the track over and over making it repetitive and tedious, and it ruins one of the best things about this game (which is the soundtrack). I've also had my character randomly teleport into the air and then drop to the ground a few times now. The characters faces in this also look like an absolute joke. They look like wax or plastic and not even remotely like a actual human being, so the cutscenes end up looking far far worse than the original version.

Ubisoft also made the BS move to remove the original AC3 from uplay and steam to force people to upgrade to this new and objectively inferior version. Yeah the new graphics look nice, but everything else is worse, much worse. 

AC3 was always one of the more buggy AC games, but the number of bugs I have encountered in the first 15 hours of playing this remaster is an absolute joke and it feels far less polished than the original which was already not a very polished game. This game should be a free upgrade for anyone who owns the original AC3 on steam, not part of the odyssey season pass, and the absolutely diskish move on Ubisofts part to remove the original version to force people to cough up $40 for this new ""upgraded"" version means I cannot recommend anyone buys this game even if all the bugs and technical issues are fixed (which they wont, its a Ubisoft game).

- Improved lighting
- Improved performance
- Fixed bugs

You'll see people posting pictures where the game looks muddy, notice that they always pick shots where the light is in the same direction as the camera. They say it looks flat. Guess what, if the light isn't at an angle, you don't get shadows. Anyone who says that the game looks ""flat"" needs to go back to kindergarten, because they clearly don't understand the concept of what a shadow is. And the crowd that says ""Oh it's just a reshade filter, they just upped the saturation""... Well, sure, the game's more saturated, but the lighting in the original never looked this good. I bet you a lot of people didn't boot up the original game to compare it to the remaster, and in their nostalgic haze they're misremembering the original as being better looking than it actually was. It's happened before with video game remasters; memory is a fickle thing.

Original AC3 ran at like 20 FPS on my computer. Remastered AC3? Solid 60. Or ""62"" for whatever reason. Yeah, it's capped at 60, even though I have my monitor running at 120 Hz, but hey 60 FPS is fine. Borderless fullscreen is there and it functions perfectly, so I'm happy.

The original AC3 was always the buggy one. Everybody knows you had carts flipping out, weird animation glitches, looping audio, sometimes dialogue lines wouldn't play, subtitles would desync, random floating muskets/swords, sometimes people would pop in and out, all that sort of stuff. The game was always playable, but it just looked like it wasn't finished. And it was rushed, you can tell in the last few missions. Have they fixed that in the remaster? For the most part, yes.

I've seen floating muskets once so far, and if you go to the menu to pause a cutscene sometimes the next line of dialogue will be partially cut. But that's it, most of the old glitches are gone or drastically reduced in frequency. It feels good.

I'm not saying this is perfect, very rarely is something perfect, especially a remaster. Let's talk about the bad things.

- The original AC3 is no longer for sale
- No multiplayer
- New glitches
- Activation for those who bought the game through the season pass is annoying

Points 1 and 2 are closely related. Because the original game is no longer for sale, you'd want the remaster to be ""Complete."" It is complete as far as DLC and content, but they've removed the multiplayer, which in the original AC3 had a story to it. I never played it myself, and I've never cared about multiplayer in Assassin's Creed, but I don't see why they'd remove it after hyping a remaster. The multiplayer for even Revelations is still up and running, though hardly anyone plays it.

It's especially bad to remove the original AC3 when you're going to have people wondering how big the changes in the remaster are. It makes it look like Ubisoft has something to hide, as if they think their remaster isn't good enough, but I feel like it is. This is a genuinely good remaster, and Ubisoft has shot themselves in the foot by thinking they need to cover up the original to sell this.

As for new glitches, these are actually pretty minor. I've encountered two unrelated camera glitches so far, one of them worse than the other but neither of them really bother me much, and usually I hate it when the camera acts up in a game. The one you'll likely encounter pretty often happens when you loot a body. The camera gets ""stuck"" for anywhere between 2-10 seconds in whatever angle you were looking when you started looting. If you go into combat it usually frees itself immediately from what I can tell. It's more annoying than anything else, and it happened occasionally in Brotherhood and Revelations, though only for 2-3 seconds. The second one is where the camera will sometimes start underground when loading into an area, then it immediately pops up in half a second. That's it. So while some people are experiencing bugs, I'd wager most people aren't, or they're getting these minor bugs that don't matter.

Point 4 is arguably my biggest complaint, and it's only because this isn't intuitive until after you figure it out. So if you got the remaster through the season pass for Odysessy, then you're going to have to install both games to get this one launched. This is a 50 GB game, and Odysessy is something like 60 or 70 GB if I'm remembering right. I'm in the middle of playing through the whole series in release order, so I hadn't planned on installing the games that far ahead. It makes sense why they had to do it that way, but I was very confused at first because all the other Assassin's Creed games I've played give you the CD key through Steam and you plug that in to the uPlay launcher, that's it. My harddrive is pretty full and I can imagine other people being on limited internet data, so having to install an unnecessary 60-70 GB on top of your regular 50 GB download could be a pain in the butt.

Aside from the remaster aspect of things, how good is this game? Very good. This is actually my favorite of the Desmond Assassin's Creed games. Anyone who tells you they like AC4 over this one is plain wrong, and they need to be brought in for treason. AC4 is the worst Assassin's Creed game next to Rogue, because Assassin's Creed is about freerunning and those games are memes about boats.",1554297563,1554297563,True,40,10,0.603553116321563721,11,True,False,False

I've also noticed that the game makes my monitors flash when the game starts or I make any changes to the graphics settings. The game flashes for about a minute or so which is long enough to make you wonder if there is something wrong with your computer or the game. 
As the game is now I would not pay $40.00 for it. The only reason I have it is because it was included in the ACO season pass.

Just played the Liberation portion of this game. For a game that came out the same year and was rereleased the same way as AC3 I am way more impressed with Liberation.

1. Even with a top of the line msi gaming pc the game lags on minimum settings.
2. You cannot lower graphics past the ""normal"" setting -- ie the original AC 3's max graphic settings
3. unlike every ac game out there, you cannot remap pc keybinds ex: changing the attack button from left click to ""z"" (less chance of a missclick that screw you over) in fact no keybind can be modified including movement and quickslots. yet the original AC 3 allowed changing pc keybinds. (and dont give me the ""just use a xbox controller bullshit -- I hate xbox controls and love being able to keybind everything so I only need my one hand to play) ***it even shows an arrow as though you could change keybinds
4. the sound is glitchy as all hell. feels like I'm playing skyrim or any other game where the sound cuts out until you exit to desktop and then re-enter)
5. the ""improved combat"" feels more like AC 1 combat than it does like AC 3 or AC Odyssey combat
6. when the sound works fine, it still sounds off -- as though you are trying to listen to it underwater.
7. there is no whistle ability even though the release notes claim its there.

In short, they rushed the game out without any concern for how downgraded it is. Till they fix such issues as sound graphic options, clunky combat, keybindings and add in everything they claim they put in, don't buy the remastered unless you got it from the season pass, at least till they fix the game into something remotely usable for anyone who hates/has no support for xbox controllers.

The graphics and fluidity (i.e performance) is a huge leap forward from the previous title. Although I still get the odd choppy cutscene here and there, for the most part, it's okay. 

My biggest issue here is the lack of support for us ultrawide monitor users. Unless they plan to release a patch none of us know about, why is there an option in the menu? I'm literally not playing this game because of that sole reason as I hate playing at 16:9 on a 21:9. Also, another issue is the faces...the faces are really bad, even when everything is cranked to ultra. There's this one scene where haythem is in the Opera House at the beginning and stares at this child (for a reason I will not spoil) and the kid is enough to give you nightmares.

Apart from all that, I would highly suggest this game ONLY if you haven't played ac3 before. I got this for free since I have access to Odysseys season pass. There is a numerous amount of mechanical upgrades such as being able to double assassinate while hidden, free aim, new outfits from other titles, HUD and much more. You get all DLC and liberation for a price of $40 which is actually pretty good. But I still stand to not buy if you have played these titles, regardless if some issues were fixed. 

Score- 7/10
Buy, skip or wait for sale? Honestly a wait for sale.

I would recommend either lowering the brightness to 2 or 3 or just max it out to 10 because 5 is the default, yet worst option.

$40 is WAY too expensive for this, but totally worth it in addition to Odyssey (which for all its flaws turned out to be far better than I thought it would be, although no where near as good as Origins, Odyssey took me about 50 hours before I was finally invested enough in the game to really start enjoying it, whereas Origins only took me about 8 hours to really start loving it).

$40 is the price that a REMAKE of an older title should get, not just a minor graphical update with much needed performance enhancements.  This is a REMASTER, so go in expecting the same game with some lighting  improvements, higher resolution textures in some areas and on some models, and better performance from modern systems and you should be happy, provided you think that that is worth shelling out $40 for.  At least it does come with Liberation and all the DLC, but honestly we'd all be pissed off if it didn't.

As for the performance, I get over 60 fps consistently at 4k on my GTX 1080 Ti, however I recommend disabling in-game v-sync and instead setting fast sync through your nVidia driver control panel.  Fast sync crashes new ubisoft games, but thankfully this is on an older engine where it still works, and you'll have the benefits of no screen-tearing without reducing your fps by half if the game does temporarily drop below 60 fps.",1553896896,1553896896,True,2,0,0.477263152599334717,0,True,False,False
