The Online mode's not bad at all, aside from the M3 GTR being locked behind EA's subscription plan, but I'm glad when it showed up in single-player briefly. I still prefer it to be an in-game unlock item or part of an DLC.

My opinions below are of the single-player experience.

[h1]A partial Heat clone.[/h1]
This game takes a lot of inspiration from Heat, from the day/night theme to some old quirks, like the weird audio compression; dialogues turn other audio way down; the road feels butter-smooth even with a controller. There aren't many tracks available either, which results in a similar repetitive feel.

On how the cars perform, unlike Heat, which feels like a good mix of reality and arcade, here they are way too soft, especially the sounds. Not even the action film sound effects and graphical cues can help this.

As for racing, in late-game, opponents can be extremely hard to beat in high-payout events; there's a green La Ferrari I can't beat without blocking and ramming with my fully upgraded C8.

[h1]The visual works, kinda.[/h1]
I don't think graphical pop-ups on photorealistic cars is my cup of tea, yet it doesn't seem entirely out of place here. At least the stylized characters are kinda cool.

[h1]The story is serviceable but has the weirdest vibe ever.[/h1]
The one good thing the story does is that it gives the player character a better motivation to progress through the game: get your car and friend back. But there's no true conflict, no villain to beat whatsoever.

Unlike the main story, there's a bizarre tension between the other racers and the local authorities in the background. And this tension is never resolved.

The game also includes plenty of glimpses of reality in some of the minor dialogues, which aren't exaggerated or wacky enough to fit the style of the main story or the partially stylized world, which eventually evolved into [i]""Authorities shouldn't bother us because we express ourselves through purely illegal street races!""[/i] at the end of the game.

I wish the story could just be: [i]""By day, racers hold events to celebrate motorsport; by night, street racing is what could truly fulfill their own Need for Speed. They hate the authorities busting their fun and 'business' at night; for the authorities, it's their job to seize lawbreakers, let alone their increasingly shady 'business' keeps pushing the boundary...""[/i]

[h1]So when's the next Need for Speed?[/h1]
As much as I love to rant, I'm still looking forward to another Need for Speed game regardless of whether it includes a storyline or not, as long as this series remains one of the few racing games that still incorporates police chases as a gameplay feature sometimes.

I also hope some car companies would agree to include their products back in this series again.",1707856706,1708896050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

System 1: AMD5800X3D, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM
System 2: Intel i7 7700HQ, GTX 1060, 16GB RAM

The game runs good on both of my systems. On the weaker system, the game gives me a minimum hardware requirement warning but surprisingly still manages stable 60+fps even on a 1060.

Pros:
+The customization is great
+Personally, I enjoy the mix of animation + realistic graphics
+The selection of cars is decent
+They gave the NPC racers some delivery missions with dialogue, which makes them slightly more fleshed out characters rather than generic racing game NPCs
Cons:
-The driving mechanics is even worse than last time. I couldn't explain why or how it's somehow even worse than Heat (not even worth comparing to the 2000's games). This is pretty much the core of the game, so if it was better I could ignore all the other cons (except the next one) and probably recommend it. But alienating the long-time fans of the series and aiming to get asphalt kids to buy it is probably more profitable for EA.
-The cops are also worse than any other entry in the series or any other series that I can think of. They only exist to pad out playtime. They don't provide a challenge even at heat level 5, and there aren't any worthwhile rewards for escaping. You get a measly 2k for escaping them in the first week at heat level 5, which is barely enough for a single customization part. The worst part is that they will spawn on every corner and you'll be forced to spend a boring 5 minutes trying to escape them before you can race or go to your safehouse. They also don't serve any purpose in terms of progression so far (e.g., required milestones in MW'05).
-Buy-in fees to race. I don't want to do extra math while upgrading my car to be able to race in a high earning race first because they decided to implement something more realistic (in contrast to the arcade nature of everything else) that could've been just a ""free to race but you lose money if you place below x'th place"" system.
-The side bet gains/losses are insignificant. The only noticeable effect is that the dude you bet against who was predicted to come last now has a rubberbanding-powered jet engine strapped to his car and comes first to screw you over.
-Overall rubberbanding is also worse
-For some reason there's now also a calendar system tied to the day-night system to give players FOMO and pressure them to get money before the big race as if Heat's day and night system wasn't disliked enough.
- 75% of the soundtrack is horrible. Even if you enjoy it, the selection isn't very wide so it gets repetitive very quickly.

I might bear it enough finish the story because I've been craving an arcade racer but I highly doubt I'll ever return to it or remember that it exists afterwards",1708857702,1708857702,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So the thing that initially made me aggravated is the cop system in this game. When you're at the first week or first two weeks of the game, any heat beyond about 3 stars is extremely hard, if not impossible to escape.  It can be extremely frustrating if you're trying to build your bank to get through the game.  Apart from that I have little complaints.  The car list and artwork are fun, handling is typical NFS, not great but it is what you expect, and the story is interesting enough. This game, I feel, shines in online play.  The unlockables are challenging enough, linkups are super fun and once you get to know how to set up cars, you can be fairly competitive.

The races are what you should expect from an NFS game, but there seems to be some kind of difficulty imbalance between the races and police chases. I started on the middle difficulty (""Challenging"") and changed to easy mode after losing money to police three times in the first week. Switching to easy mode made the races too easy but brought the police down to a manageable level. I didn't want to risk losing too much money learning how to deal with police, so I left the game on easy.

The soundtrack is decent once you figure out to skip any song with ""brrrr"" in it and songs with heavy auto tune. Can't skip tracks in the shop, so you need to mute.
-----------------------
It's junk. It's not terrible, might be fun online with friends or human players, but if you're the kind of person that just wants to do races to earn money and play through the story, then skip this unless you're good at navigating around in the dark finding a hole to hide in.

When you complete races you accumulate heat, you will inevitably accumulate max heat and then be bombarded by an infinite supply of indestructible police vehicles until you can find the buggy area that police won't go. This will happen at night, so you better have the map remembered and you better know where those buggy hiding places are. Also, once you accumulate heat, it stays on until you hit a safe house to end the night. You can shut off your car and hide outside in the dark, but helicopters will spawn over your location and multiple police will roam the area even if they didn't see you get to your hiding location. You will lose all money accumulated that night when you are busted, so I'm not even in the mood to experiment because too much is at stake. This turns into a stealth game where you run from point to point shutting off your car to avoid teleporting helicopters until you get to a safe house.

I will probably finish the game, might even use a trainer if the police situation gets worse, but it's not very good game with the police situation. I started on Challenging difficult (mid difficulty), kept getting busted so I switched to easy. I wasn't even having difficulty with the races, just getting wrecked by the police afterwards.",1707791086,1708651147,False,6,1,0.549868106842041016,0,True,False,False

(if you've played an NFS game from the last 10 years, its the same.. except the steering is both better and worse. However, the game is wonky to set up (took me about 2hrs and multiple system locks/crashes to finally make it playable, and ive had 3 additional game crashes in the 15hrs I've played. Also, on 2 instances, when completing a race, the game would only allow me to retry a race instead of ""continuing"" and collecting the money. If it only had these minor bugs, I'd say its decent enough if you get a decent sale on it. 
But I'm not recommending it because there is a crashing issue that seems to have been going on for at least 4 months from what I saw. Below is what my research turned up and that ultimately fixed the system lock/crash.

I don't recommend unless you are willing to fiddle with it until you can get it to work. (i also did the shader delete thing so I can't be positive, but in theory, this is all that needs to be done)

I'm fairly certain the 2 main crashes people have can be fixed by adding a file called ""user.cfg"" into the game files - (right click the game,  click manage, click brows local files, add new text file, give in a different name, open it, paste the info below, save-as ""user.cfg"".   
Copy the text below- changing 24 to the number of cores your CPU has, and change 32 to the number of threads your computer has.

Thread.ProcessorCount 24
Thread.MaxProcessorCount 24 
Thread.MinFreeProcessorCount 0 
Thread.JobThreadPriority 0 
GstRender.Thread.MaxProcessorCount 32 

*note, my computer still crashed a few more times after this file was added, but the green loading bar got a little further each time. If it keeps crashing in the same spot, reduce the 24 number by 1-2, and then reduce the 32 number by 2-4(respectively) (or possibly just change the Thread.MinFree... to 1 or 2).  (If you do end up lowering the numbers, you'll have to change them back once it starts working,(close the game first) (it may crash again after setting the correct numbers, but the green bar should make more progress each time.)

If you're unsure what your 24 and 32 numbers should be, just google your processor name (for mine ""intel i9-14900k"" click the link to intel(or amd) link, and it should tell you how many cores and threads (for intel with P and E, do the total core number)

but once you get it working, it should keep working without further adjustment.

If you recall how the previous part of Heat looked and how much time was spent on its development, then the reason why Unbound is as it is becomes clear: it truly didn't have enough time to mature. The apple was plucked while still green, without waiting for it to ripen.

NFS Unbound is not a game, but a digital monument. Or, to be precise, a tombstone.

This chapter of the series is a clear sign that the brand “Need for Speed” has long been buried by the owner. The game could have found a place in the hearts of racing fans thanks to its unusual visual style, which is an additional way to provide visual feedback, as well as customizable controls. But alas, all the efforts of the developers are definitely buried by the too short development time, small budget and publisher’s desire to make as much money as possible. Therefore, we got uncomfortable gameplay, absurd plot, bland characters, problematic interface, poor optimization and unnecessary DLC.

It doesn’t matter what the next NFS game will be about - classic racing in the eighties of the twentieth century or a story-driven game with a criminal in the main role, participating in illegal races in the cyber city in 2808.

Edit: Finally was able to play after upgrading. The customization and car selection is good. Multiplayer is much better compared to the other NFS games. You can actually find people to race. The drifting mechanics are kind of deep which is cool, but the game doesn't really tell you how it works. The Nitro Burst is awesome. The soundtrack could be better/ worse. There are a few songs I actually like but there are multiple songs that are just terrible, and it makes me appreciate Heat's soundtrack a little more. Cop and Racer AI can be annoying and are very much capable of ruining the race. When you're about to lose the cops, there is a very high chance that a cop or helicopter will just spawn in front of you. It's especially annoying when you're in an area that doesn't have a lot of turns to avoid them. The crashing mechanics are by far the most annoying thing about the game.

*UPDATE*
Managed to get the game to be playable...well..as playable as it was intended to be. I don't know if this is how NFS games all are now, but you need to completely forget how to control a vehicle in literally any other game. Cars go from a weird semi-understeer at lower speeds to unbelievably perfect grip then will suddenly break into a drift without you doing anything different all in one corner...countersteering seems to be set up full arcade style because actually trying to control the drift just straightens the car out. It's the most bizarre vehicle handling physics I've ever played. I was just playing Most Wanted 05 last week and compared to this, it might as well be a simulator for car handling.

I honestly don't think I can stand to finish the campaign. I'm pretty sure they could have gotten better voice actors as free volunteers because this is BAD. Tons of wasted time in forced cutscenes that tell a hilariously bad ""story"" and while racing, you've got a passenger yapping the whole time. If I have to hear ""we got more air than the mayor!"" one more time, I'm uninstalling.

I'm not even an hour in, sure, but the game is trying so damn hard to be cool and edgy, it's just bad. NFS seriously needs to go all the way back to the Road and Track game dumping anything resembling story and just figure out the cars. That's what we're here for - cool cars that go fast and can be customized how we want. All the rest of it just gets in the way. If this is how bad soundtracks are gonna be, just kill it. Save the licensing fees and just say ""hey, you're gonna want to have good driving playlist going before you start the game.""",1708461318,1708482781,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was not exactly exited when this got anounced. ( the effects seemed to cheezy & cartoon-ized charecters have never been something I've ever been into per say ). BUT when this went on sale in dec for $14 canadian ... it was cheap enough to peak my curiousity about the game ( since EA still refuses to put baseball & hockey back on the PC !! ).

Honestly ... when I 1st started to play this ... I wasnt impressed with the visuals ... 73+ hrs later .. story line finished & now im here writing this. HA HA HA

Im running a AMD Ryzen 9 5900X + Win 10 on a Gen 4 1 TB M.2 drive with the game installed on a Gen 4 2 TB M.2 drive ... 1st part of the game was played on a Radeon 6600 XT & remaining on a Radeon 6800 over a Samsung oddysy 240 hz 27"" display. With most graphics levels on high .. I was getting around 120 fps on th 6600 XT .. moving to the 6800 with same settings netted me close to 200 fps in the game.

Overally .... realism in the game is rather good in the car models & such ( mind you the peaple dont move right when they are infront of you at times LOL ) Is pretty good. Sounds are pretty solid for realism .. Music .. too new hip & trendy for me so I left it off.  The cartoony effects over the cars like the burn outs & such ... some where cool/ok ... others too "" gimic-y "".  Oh ... I played on medium mode ..... road blocks where placed TERRIBLY in the game .. too easy to avoid or more so use to disable the cops in chases.

At the end of the day ... if you ignore the cartoon-y parts of the game ... its pretty good ( at the lower price point I paid ) The story was good, not great ... BUT the voice acting done in the game was VERY well done & made the game enjoyable when playing.

The damage system is understandable until you consider the cops. In need for speed most wanted (2005), the only way you could get your car functioning less than pristine was getting hit by spike strips, yet the cops in most wanted were still challenging at high heat levels. Because of the way the cops interact in unbound as of right now, the cops go from too easy at levels 1-3 to downright impossible starting at level 4 and going to 5. 

The palace edition upgrade really isn't, instead of giving you the vehicles that youve paid to have, it just unlocks the ability to buy them in game, when you could realistically either buy the stock version of those where the stock version is available, or just do without that specific car. On that note, I did buy the palace edition preorder, and therew was a widespread problem that still is effecting me, where I cannot get to those DLC vehicles in the multiplayer. Not to mention compared to the old need for speed games the soundtrack for this game kinda sucks, leaning a bit too hard into the graffiti-hip hop type genre, and away from the hard rock/metal and light EDM of the previous games.

Everything else, the general handling (fishtailing at high speeds still sucks) the customization, and the visual and sound design are amazing, and i've even grown to like the graffiti-cartoony effects and the sound tags, and the tracks for the races are well built. All in all, ill keep playing the game, but those of you who read this review, these issues are pretty much the only problems I have with the game, so I can styill work with it, but they are pretty agregious things. Nothing compares to the annoyance of being in a cop chase and not being able to escape, and being hit with 2 choppers as backup, stun locking you with level 5 cops and choppers until you give up either the chase of on the game for a while.

My recommendation to EA is to aim the cops so they function and interact with the player as they do in Most wanted, including how the damage goes. Heck, even keeping player vehicle damage in but making it less of a problem, as most of the fun in dealing with the cops in most wanted was beating em litrerally, instead of just running.
Next recommendation which is much more realistic: Fix the way the paid content works, and make it worthwhile for people to get so you'll get less people refunding or not even buying the DLC.  

Manyn companies are making their games good enough to get some people to buy them, but shoddy enough that it takes minimal effort. These companies would be much more profitable if they put their hearts and souls into the games, which will in turn make many more people buy it that would have before, like Elden ring, Halos 1 2 and 3, and even older need for speed titles that were fun because they appealed to audiences who wanted to be able to have nothing but fun playing the games they wanted to play.

-Edit: I checked in on the game because I saw they're actually planning on adding some stuff to the game that seem interesting, only to find out that when I bought the Palace edition for an extra price, not only have I still not gotten anything in game for it, there are 5 customs packs, 3 thru 5 costing money that as someone who bought the more expensive edition of the game, I would have to spend an additional 45 dollars to have access to extra content that they have released.

- AWFUL soundtrack
- too many repetitive, boring police chases
I don't care how good or bad they are, just don't force one after every freaking race
- limited amount of retries ???????? 
- Normal races have buy-in(like why?) and drift events/paint the city events absolutely freaking suck, especially if you don't have a car tuned specifically for them
- can't upgrade cars to the max since you'll exceed the race tier requirements, if your car is too good, you can't take part in most races, you're in a maxed car for the current tier? too damn bad, others will still overtake you like it's nothing
- Did I mention, absolutely abysmal soundtrack? 
- Dialogue & story are just cringe. 
Bring back NFS 2005. PLEASE. Remove this car tier restriction nonsense. Or at least make it like payback where you have a car for each type of event. The way it is now, I might have a ton of money with 0 incentive to use them on upgrading my car because of these damned restrictions.

Some pros:
- Good customization (had that since 2015 but now with few additions)
- Unique visuals
- uh...vroom vroom?

TL;DR: No fast travel, the absurd amount of forced (boring) chases, the crappy (unfitting) soundtrack and the lack of incentive to upgrade cars build a rather meh experience at best.

When you go to the map to select a race, there are extra steps. They show the same shit on the map that you see at the event, not a problem. It's the steps that's the issue. Then, when you get to the event, it's there, too. In heat, at least, you drove to the race, and you pressed one button, that's it. This extra nonsense to make up with the fact that they have to show that this game isn't a mistake makes it more glaringly obvious that it is.
Racing

My car is slow as shit, and you have me in races with super cars. They're gone in no seconds flat! What point does this serve? The rubber banding is so bad in this game, it's giving NFS: Heat a run for its money. I have to slog further through the story to unlock the feature to upgrade my car's specs. In NFS: Unbound, you start off with a beater. Where, in other NFS games, you start off in a really nice car, and you downgrade to a beater. So, why do I have to be antagonized before I can upgrade my car?
Driving

Driving in a straight line causes me to spin out, I'm fishtailing like a MF, and it's always random. The fact that I have a slow car means I have a slow start. While everyone else around me is gone, I'm still getting my tires to spin and actually gain [traction]. There has to be something I'm missing here because um...
Moving on...
Characters

This is the first NFS game where I absolutely do not care about the characters. Where I absolutely skipped the cutscenes.  Where I wanted to desperately go back to when the main protagonist never talked, you didn't even see their faces. You just knew you disliked Cross, Darius, etc., and you must get away from them or beat them to get their pink slips. Things were simpler back then.
Music

I had cut off all in-game music. I did the same for NFS: Heat, but at least when I played Heat, I got to the point where I made my own racing playlist in Spotify and played that. Furthermore, I love hip-hop, but it's like they chose every developer's song that they disliked and put it in the game. What happened to variety? 
Dialogue

Now, being a Need for Speed veteran, the dialogue is always cheesy, borderline embarrassing to witness even. Unbound though? I'm convinced they had an AI write and voice the dialogue. It's so bad. I'm cringing harder than I've ever cringed, and we have NFS: Heat. I didn't think it could get any worse than NFS: Heat. It makes me glad they left it on a cliffhanger; or put it off that way.

Why is it the only thing the developers listened to the gamers about was to add people. I think that's the dumbest shit to date. I remember people asking for this for almost a decade, and it was ignored. Why add people now? It was always a stupid idea. Now, it's a stupid idea manifested. NFS: ProStreet, it made sense to have people. There were closed tracks. It's a distraction, and it doesn't add anything to the game. It actually causes more problems. Not only that, but it's such an unintelligent, simple-minded addition, and I hope this isn't going to be commonplace in future NFS titles. But, I'll take that over this game entirely as long as the game is good.
Explosions

Everything explodes. Traffic cones, guardrails, gates, etc. Nothing is that pliable. Everything is...finicky; like a delicate little flower. I shouldn't send sparks flying from hitting a traffic cone. Trees disappear and then, confetti. It seems lazy. This is a minor issue, but it gets a spotlight because it seems like everything in this game is made of papier-mâché.
Restricted

For a game called unbound, you're bound. Like NFS No Limits, you're extremely limited. Unbound is restrictive. From the few races I've done, I can tell you're not able to do a goddamned thing. The map feels empty, you're only assigned races. You can't venture off and do anything on the map. It's a paywall, minus the pay.
Gameplay

I didn't like having to pick between night and day in Heat, I for damn sure don't like it in Unbound. The stupid weekly system that's been implemented. Why? What the absolute FUCK? The cops are annoying AF. And that's saying A LOT because this franchise is BUILT on a cat and mouse system. The handling, like I mentioned earlier, it's worse in races. I'm clunking along and everyone else seems to be strapped to rockets on ice. While we're on handling, I'll never understand why they had to change how you drift in these games. Underground 2, Most Wanted, Carbon, drifting was fun and it made sense. They complicated something that didn't have to be complicated at all. The buy-in system isn't needed. This is, again, another attempt at doing something unnecessarily different.
Mods

I've had to add mods to make this game playable. Not even enjoyable because I still can't bring myself to play this for no longer than one race.

I miss when developers actually TRIED and wasn't obligated by red tape and someone telling them, ""time is money, and you're wasting time, hurry TF up!"" I miss the era of Most Wanted (2005), Underground 1 and 2. Man, I miss wanting to play a NFS game, now when I see a new release, I assume it's a disappointment, and I've been right every single time. I don't want a remastered/remake of the old games because they'd just ruin that, too. Just listen to us past adding people walking on the sidewalks into the game. 

All in all this game, in my humble opinion is...",1708469182,1708469182,False,0,0,0.496987968683242798,0,True,False,False

Like, the map is honestly amazing, best one i've seen from NFS in a decade, but they didn't build it with the handling in mind, most cars feel axactly the same, a Civic handles same as a LaFerrari when the performance tier is the same.
And the later speed races are a pain, AI is unforgiving, and when you just hit a small bump in the road, the handling goes gugu gaga and yeets you off the road and you already lost the race.
I know this is kind of a rant but having played ProStreet and Shift and now going to this, the handling just feels so clunky and unconsistent",1708436124,1708436656,False,1,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

[h2] Good  [/h2]

[h3] Atmosphere [/h3] 
Heat felt a little sanitised and slightly grey. Technically a step in the right direction, but not so much personality overall. The map in Unbound is a lot warmer, and combined with the added crowds on foot, the meetup system instead of just randomly starting in the middle of roads, and the distinct characters with distinct cars and bios, it actually feels like a ""scene"" instead of just disconnected races.

[h3] Graphics [/h3] 
Next gen game with suitable next gen graphics. Cars looks great and map looks great.

[h3] Cars [/h3] 
They all look good and there's a lot of customisation. Unfortunately basically just what was in Heat though. They handle the way they have for the last few game so if you're not a fan there's no changes there.

[h3] Car Class System [/h3]  
Encourages you to build a garage with a lot of variety instead of just maxing three cars like the level-only system with Heat. 

[h3] Limited Race Restarts [/h3] 
Made the stakes feel high, but also prevented just mindlessly replaying each race until you win it. Oddly freeing to finish a race in 2nd and just move on.

[h3] Buy Ins/ Bets [/h3] 
Needing to buy into races and having a chance to lose money without being able to redo the race made the races actually feel risky and rewarding to finish.

[h3] Takeovers [/h3] 
Nice mode, enjoy it more than Drift races. I hope they keep it for the next game. 

[h3] Animated Characters [/h3] 
Hot take but the anime characters work well for NFS, and feel very Underground 2. They also allow for there to be crowds in the city since they're very low detail, and makes it a lot easier for the focus to go into places where it matters.

[h2] Mixed [/h2]

[h3] Police [/h3] 
Felt really really oppressive for the first half of the game, and spent most of the time in free-roam trying to escape police so I could get to the actual races.  It really dampened the whole experience and caused me to stop playing for a while since getting to races felt like a chore. Until I bought the relevant Auxiliary items for my cars. But since the class system leads to you having many cars, it is not easy or feasible to put the expensive Anti-Police mods on all of them. 

[h3] Racer AI [/h3] 
Feels like it's better than at launch, so not many complaints now. Just weird moments where a racer will crash just in front of you and then reset in an odd way that somehow prevents them from losing their lead. Just a little buggy and glitchy. 

[h3] Lakeshore Online [/h3] 
Missing stuff at launch, and has a lot of untapped potential (as usual). I play online a lot more in Unbound than Heat, surprisingly. The cop meetups are fun. The speed passes are whatever. Having separate offline/online garages felt weird but it's grown on me a little, and the unlock challenges for cars add things to work for after the campaign. I will actually continue playing it, which I didn't with Heat. Overall better than Heat, but much untapped potential.

[h3] DLC [/h3] 
I honestly haven't really even looked too far into these Volumes and DLCs they sell, just not really interested. I understand that the goal is to add longevity to the game, especially with Online, and I do think there is potential there, but whatever they're doing hasn't appealed to me at all.

[h3] Soundtrack [/h3]  
Next game should probably just have 3 or 4 radio stations since it's impossible to please everyone at this point. Personally the soundtrack was fine but most people disagree.

[h3] Car Effects [/h3] 
Personally liked them but the concept needs to be improved upon a lot. Ties in well theoretically with the anime characters, but something felt off.

 [h2] Bad [/h2] 

[h3] Writing/characters/plot [/h3]  
Unfortunately did damage to the reputation of the rest of the game when combined with the controversial style additions. NFS has never had ""good"" writing, and writing doesn't matter that much to me personally, but the shoehorned modern slang + unconvincing lines + attempts to include social media (""Our last race has hundreds of hits on YouTube!!!"") just didn't land very well at all in the context of NFS. The story itself had quite an anticlimactic ending too, with the final race not really feeling any different at all to normal races. I honestly don't think it's as big a deal as people make it out to be, but it's definitely part of what caused the damage to the perception.

[h3] The Launch [/h3]  
Online mode was lacking at launch. No police in free roam online was a very weird omission (Added eventually). And then the initial follow up patch did very little to address anything people. It's also definitely still a little buggy compared to Heat.

[h3] Weird Aesthetic Direction [/h3]  
Sort of ties into the writing, and I don't know how to really put this into words. Car effects/ Anime characters are all actually ideas I like and hope they stick with, but it was all filtered through this weird slightly dated/incorrect view of what kids like. Kind of seeped into the whole game. It's not even a problem to aim the game at the demographic most likely to play it, but it felt like they kinda missed that as well. 

[h3] Removal of Drag/ Off-road races [/h3]  
Off-road wasn't the most popular in past games, but it feels weird to have the dedicated off-road events removed, especially with all of the off-road car parts still present. The people who don't like them could just skip them the way the game is structured. Drag races need to come back.

Visually, is is gorgeous, the animated style of the characters and effects on the cars grows on you alot, and the skill gap with driving feels better than in previous games (usually), but there are many downsides.

1. Inconsistency: while the skill gap feels better when it's working as intended, there are MANY times that driving mechanics are inconsistent and frustrating. For example how long you have to press the brake or how hard you have to steer to initiate a drift, or the worst offender, the stats for each vehicle meaning nearly nothing. Me and a friend played this game quite a lot, in the same room on the same network, and my car with a 2.1 0-60 would accelerate from 0 slower than his car with a 2.4 0-60, or vice versa, regardless of if you hit the launch correctly. 

2. Mundane, repetitive gameplay: The story in this game is downright boring. You don't care about the characters, you never have a reason to be invested, and the format of the ENTIRE campaign is the same. Fixed day/night cycle that brings you through the whole week with a big race at the end. Repeat this four times. The first week is fun, and the idea is great, but the execution is just so boring, especially when you hit week 3 and you're only half done. Online is no better. Say you want to get the Regera, the best car in the game (not the most expensive, not even close). It costs about 1.5 million. You get an average of around 35 PER PLAYLIST. This means for THREE RACES. So roughly 12 ish thousand per playlist. That means you're doing some 125 races for ONE car.  This is without any customization or mods for it. And the races are all class locked, so there really are only 10 or so playlists for any class, and noone wants to race in a B class car, the lowest tier in the game.

This game had a lot of potential, it really did, but it was not taken advantage of. If you can get the game super cheap, give it a shot, why not. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE.",1708328596,1708328596,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a long time NFS fan ever since Underground 1 back when I was a kid, and to my surprise, contrary to what most of the community seems to say, Unbound is a really great game with a lot going for it, with a few valid shortcomings that don't detract too much from the experience.

To start off with the presentation, Unbound's environment is set up in fictional Chicago and stylistically takes inspiration from Anime like Initial D and Wangan Midnight with its character designs, and Spiderverse with its visual flair and effects. To add to the Chicago setting, the majority of the music in game is predominantly rap music, but it is a very eclectic variety of rap including Korean, European, African, Middle Eastern, and Spanish rap. There's also a few electronic songs as well. After experiencing the soundtrack in its entirety, and considering the group of songs they used for grounding the environment, and how the songs are generally indicative of what is popular in music currently, I eventually warmed up to it and like a lot of the songs included, there are some real ear worms that'll keep you coming back too.

Secondly, the handling is much improved compared to Heat and NFS 2015. It isn't perfect, but both drifting through corners as well as handling them planted are both viable strategies and are rewarded with boost nitrous allowing you to keep momentum. Flicking the left stick no longer instantly puts you in a drift so it no longer feels like a mobile game and is a lot more predictable. At higher speeds there can be some odd interactions with highway curbs and jumps that can unsettle your car and may put it into a drift, but this is nowhere near as bad as it was in Heat and 2015. There are tiered performance classes that are generally balanced, but once you go online there are some cars that are way over tuned compared to others, and that might become a frustration depending on your strategy.

People complaining about the story are curious to me, as Need for Speed has generally always had a story to drive a narrative to keep the single player experience somewhat interesting, and the one in Unbound is pretty good for what it is, the characters have pretty nice quips and jokes in-between races, and the fact that the AI racers have comments during races really makes the game feel a lot more alive and is a great addition. The game is very self aware and makes references and goofy jokes basically across the entire experience. Even during pursuits the police have funny one liners to keep things fresh.

In terms of technology, the game runs well on my 5950X and Arc A770 system. I get around 90 FPS with upscaling at 1440p. Load times are fast, no shader compilation stutters at all, and while the game isn't pushing boundaries in terms of technology, it looks pretty good all things considered. It doesn't have the insane art direction of NFS 2015 sadly. Also ray tracing is absent which would have been a nice bonus. I reccomend watching Digital Foundry's video on Unbound if you want more info.

The online experience is also great too. By and large, most people just want to race respectfully, and you will rarely see rammers or anything of the like. The biggest annoyance that is valid is you can't share your single player cars with the online mode, but online races and linkups pay a ton, so it isn't too much of an issue in practice. Since Criterion are the devs, I can definitely see some Burnout influence in the online mode for the better. The linkup events are pretty fun when you do them with a large group of other players, and reminds me of the garage scene in 2 Fast 2 Furious.

With how much there is to like about the game, there are some genuine issues that can make the game pretty annoying in certain situations:

The police at higher heat levels can become very frustrating if you come out of a race in a lower tiered car, and at heat levels 4 and 5, it can be nearly impossible to escape unless you have an S or S+ car, especially with how low the cooldown is for reinforcements. 
Also the early single player is kind of a slow burn before the cars become fast enough to feel enjoyable. Some of the fun gets sapped away when the cars are annoying to control during races, especially when you aren't able to outrun the police after doing several races during a day or night sequence.

To sum up, NFS Unbound is a solid entry in the series, and tries to be bold with its presentation and create a fresh take on the formula started by NFS 2015. There's a lot to like here, and I definitely recommend grabbing it on sale for 20 bucks or below, it really is a great game if you're a fan of the series.",1708302569,1708302569,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

By soundtrack I mean the music. I love the way the cars sound and how the world sounds while driving in it.

The good:
- Graphics and the style
- People are everywhere walking the streets, and there are few animals
- The map is really nice and feels alive
- There is always full maps of players playing online (2024)

The bad:
- Music, this is the worst gypsy NFS music by far... no choice here you have to mute the music
- The collectible art graffiti is really bad... and political
- No inside cockpit view
- The online racing tracks are too few, no off road tracks, tracks are boring and most times force you to drive on opposite road direction
- Driving with 100 KM/h and passing a crossroad feels exactly the same like running with your feet in real life. The speed is 1/3 of real speed, way off... (this must be patched...) 

Would recommend for steam deck especially on windows

It has a wide variety of cars but not too much to where its overwhelming, Great and easy to understand car customisation, fun gameplay loop and, compared to what you others say, its actually a really good looking game when you ignore the more cartoon like characters and car effects (which you can turn off). 

My only real complaints are that the heat (level that represents how wanted you are by the cops) system is broken, with you now being able to get max heat after only 2-5 races. This is remedied by the fact that you can purchase upgrades and better cars to make it easier to avoid/outrun the police (once you get around half way through the game, you can pretty much get away from the cops with ease) but that doesn't mean its not annoying having the cops on your tail 24/7, making getting to races really annoying especially when you need to use lower tier cars.

I hate tess. if I could remove tess from the game I would) at the very least though, the gameplay loop is good enough to make you forget that the story exists.

Pros:
- Graphics
- Customisation
- Effects
- Better Driving Physics
- No Microtransactions besides for paid DLC

Cons:
- Terrible Game Mechanics
- Subpar Story
- Stupid Characters
- Stupid and Sometimes Annoying Dialogue
- Garbage UI
- Lacks good Presentation
- No Split screen
- No Radio Stations
- Hardly any good Music
- Worst Accessibility/Settings in a Racing Game
- Grind
- Cops are annoying even on Easy difficulty
- Terrible Implementation or Rubberbanding AI
- Unnecessary RPG Leveling System
- To many Menus
- Ugly Loading Screens
- No Supra (EA Should just pay the damn Licensing fee)
- No Cockpit view
- No properly implemented Keyboard/Racing Wheel Input Bindings
- No Innovations, from previous NFS Entries, Such as Carbon, MW, etc.
- EA APP
- Denuvo
- No memorable Bosses or Characters
- Weak Level Design, Everything just looks the same.
- No Opening Scene telling players to ""Drive Safe, Obey the Rules of the road, and Always wear your seat belt""
- No Good Cringe like the older NFS games.
- Poor implementation of keeping users playing. eg, let me Fast Travel to a Race, like Carbon, Sometimes I just want to Race and not deal with the BS of this game.
- Paid DLC and Pointless Digital Deluxe Edition.
- The Anime Character Visuals are more miss than Hit.
- Missing Customisation for cars or lacking certain decals/ systems from previous games. 
- No Auto Optimisation for Car Performance Upgrades.
- Pointless/Poorly thought-out Heat System, Why does heat increase after every race, it should be based on my Aggression based on Police and If a Police Unit Notices me during Racing or open world.
- No Impounds
- No Pink Slip or Other option Cards to earn and Use, to get cars or special Items.
- No in garage Customisation(I mean I can't see my car in a garage, it goes to some external infinite void)
- Unfair AI advantage, such as that racer having a Higher tier car than you.
- No Gameplay mechanics that affect how players play the game(A recovery mechanic) like the Slow-mo that we had for games like NFS MW and CARBON.
- No Need For Speed (It feels like I'm Travelling 60 KM/H when I'm going over nearly 200KM/H)

I'm Gonna keep adding to this list because I love the NFS Franchise and EA Doesn't have a Single Clue on how to make a good NFS Racing game. 

Carbon, MW and Underground, Still to this day are the Best in the Franchise.

The Positives

Really expansive car list including cars like the Ford Crown Vic, The Dodge Charger Hellcat and others.
Civilians making the game a lot more realistic.
ASAP Rocky had a nice performance.


The Negatives

Racing feels incredibly rigged. My car can be redlining, reaching its breaking point and about to explode and you'll still have some doofus like Justicia or Harlow about 200 Yards away, cruising without any problem, even though my car is the top tier in its quality. You will hate the racers after this. This Need For Speed game was one of the few which made me absolutely HATE racing in this game due to how terrible it is.

The Police Chases aren't fun. While I can appreciate some of the changes, the chases haven't ever felt like a risk. I was able to escape from level 5 pursuits with a B tier 100 racing grade tier (Very low, if you didn't play the game.) I never felt at risk, and I never felt like the police would catch me. The cops can't keep up with you and they're very defensive, which makes the game boring. These cops aren't some large, intimidating force, they're annoying little critters.

The legendary car kits in this game suck. I admit, I ain't a big car bodykit mod guy, never was, never will be. But these cars look terrible and like they're out of some cheap Cyberpunk 2077 esque game. Sharp angles and such do NOT make the game look fun.

The soundtrack sucks. Granted, I hate every NFS soundtrack after 2014' but this soundtrack is especially TERRIBLE. The older games had hard hitting songs like Echoes and Twin Flames from HP 2010' and HPR, Decadence from MW05' , NWO from The Run and Castle of Glass from Rivals. All of those songs sound ten times better then hEeEeEeEeEEEEy we want some maaaaaaaaaaaneeyyy!!!! IMO. The old games gave you an adrenaline boost, these games give you an anger boost.



Overall, Unbound isn't terrible but it isn't good. I didn't find it enjoyable. You really should buy something like HEAT if your like me and just want a police chase experience.

1. Driving - pretty much as expected from a NFS game
It can be pretty fun, nothing impressive. Very similar to the ""heavier"" steering feel in the recent NFS games. I've also had a few moments when I'm driving 200 kmh and the car decides to start oversteering and send me into a wall.

2. Races - decent 
Diversity is lacking, but I like how the 'timeline' itself is structured. I also like that you are not expected to win if your car is not up to spec. The AI is actually fast and doesn't need the ""rubber banding"" we got used to in NFS games.

3. Graphics - terrible
There is no toggle for the 'comic book' effects. This is the main reason I dislike this game.
We went from filmed cutscenes in the 2000s to characters drawn in paint, i don't know how they could come up with such an idea.
Aside from this, the game looks good, but it's not impressive. If we compare the night time graphics to NFS 2015 I think I actually prefer that one

4. Story - great
I quite like it, can't say too much without spoiling but it reminds me of an Old-School NFS game. 
There are a few cringy dialogues but maybe I am getting too old for this

5. Customization - [strike] great [/strike] ok, but worse in comparison
IMO NFS still has the best visual customization in the racing genre. That being said, I feel it's lacking compared to the latest titles (Heat has a lot more variation). Of course, I haven't had time to 'explore' all the cars so [strike] I'll update this review if my opinion changes [/strike]
Update: It's worse than I thought. Seems like they focused more on bodykits than individual parts, but most bodykits are outright hideous. Some cars have great individual customization, but most get a meh from me. Definitely worse than previous titles.

6. Police chases - decent
Not much changed in this aspect, only thing new is it displays the type of police cars that can show up depending on heat level. I feel there are way too many police cars in free roam, but that might just be personal preference.

7. Open world - pathetic
It's very small by modern standards (It's probably comparable to Undercover but don't quote me on that) and doesn't have a lot of diversity. Compared to NFS Payback, it's worse by every metric I can think of.

8. No fast travel - ???
When you leave the garage for a race, it spawns you at the nearest safehouse. However, if you want to do another event after that's on the other side of the map you have to drive to it. It took me around 3 hours to get bored of the map because of always needing to drive the same main roads back and forth.

Overall, can't recommend it. I'm not buying another NFS game until they ditch this art style or at least let me toggle it off somehow.",1707826187,1708170817,False,8,0,0.582743227481842041,0,True,False,False

Cop chases are improved in the sense that they feel more dynamic and you have more tools at your disposal to escape and combat them. However they are more passive than in Heat, which in turn makes them less of a threat (I was only busted once during my entire play-through and I had heat 5 almost every single night and played on hard).

Story is cringe like always, but the game does a great job of not letting it interfere with the gameplay. I also really like the sense of progression in this title as you have to work for everything and there really aren't any RNG shortcuts for great rides. Also really like the new NOS mechanic that was introduced as it adds another intuitive gameplay element.

The map feels very generic when compared to Heat and doesn't really have it's own identity nor any particularly memorable landmarks. However the inclusion of pedestrians and parked cars does wonders of elevating the feeling of this being a place with actual humans in. The freeroam cops also aren't ideal and there are many times when you're stuck tailing one at the pace of a slog since you can't pass them without being seen. Finally, I much prefer the system of heat where the wanted level also worked as a multiplier and you had three repairs each night (Here there's only a four minute cooldown between each one). There also weren't any off road / cross country races which was a missed opportunity since the map certainly supported them.

So yeah, all in all a very safe title in the sense that it didn't change much at all from Heat. Some improvements here and there, but also some steps backwards on other things. Regardless there really isn't and hasn't been anything like NFS for like a decade and this is definitely one of the stronger racing titles that has come out over the last decade.

I had the car tuned to the max without going over the class limit. Even so, I couldn't pass the first guy many times and i only won when he hit something and crashed.

Negatives - it's cheap for a reason.
- The whole cartoon looking characters is a terrible idea.
- The driving mechanic between drifting and driving normally is terrible
- There is too much talking going on from the other characters which was probably done to make the game feel alive but it's annoying and most of the time it's talking bull.
- The whole game is based on two things, go to event then go back to garage... nothing else.
- After completing a race, you have to go back to the garage for some silly reason sometimes which wastes time. 
- There is a clear rubber banding going on. Even though your a god racer you can't get away or catch up to the car behind or in front despite your car being a driving god.
- The whole game seems to revolve around 13r olds with the clothing and soundtrack. Would be nice to play a game like this but if it was focused at everyone. Most of the shoes are Nikes or adidas which tells you everything you need to know.
- There is a nice feeling driving around but sadly the fun goes away after one hour or so. Depends on how much more of that music you can take in the background and nonsense talking from the people in the garage. 

Would recommend for people around 13 but if you thought this is a racing game then don't buy this. Goat simulator is more fun than this.

The cars handling is unique to each, but some cars are forced to some category (Some cars will be grip no matter what and some cars will drift your face into the wall even with full grip)

The story is what I'd describe as decent at best, and the dialogues feel very forced. Nothing feels natural in this game when it comes to cutscenes and interactions.

All these points, along with the weird progression, the car tiers limiting you along the NPC spawning and the rivals cars tiers making no sense when compared to their performance made the game slightly unfun to play, and the small and relatively empty map didn't have much to see.

People have talked about how the cartoon elements have grown on them, but personally I just can't. The realistic graphics mixed with that made it feel very weird, and I am much disappointed that we can't turn them off

Pros
1- Design: Stuff looks phenomenal, customization of characters and cars are actually pretty decent as well;
2- Soundtrack: This one is definitely controversial but I like R&B style so ofc I like the game soundtrack;
3- Game is fun (only racing mode imo). 

Cons:
1- Dialogues are so bad that it actually makes me cry. In fact, I'd rather die than to hear another dialogue from Tess about a random mission that nobody cares about;

2- Takeover and that other game mode suck, I can't believe how boring they are. The game literally tries to shove it down your throat;

3- CAN'T CUT CORNERS AND USE THE WHOLE SCENARIO WHEN PLAYING A 'STREET RACE'. LMAO, THE FACT THAT IT'S A ""STREET RACE"" SHOULD MEAN NO RULES. INSTEAD, YOU GET A GAME THAT TRIES TO CONTROL HOW YOU PLAY IT.

4- Often times, you feel like you are working, people are calling you, making you stupid demands for more MONEY  more Money. Please, I already have a job, don't keep pressing me, holy F.

5- There is a cap to the level you can upgrade your cars based on your current 'street level'. You can't imagine how disappointing that is to someone who was grinding my ass off trying to get a decent build. ;(

6- Restart limit? I mean, this game has so many cars and props that is hard not to hit one of them. Why would you do us like that?

7- Did I mention how HAVING TO STACK MONEY for buy-ins is the most boring and outdated concept of all times? I'm literately stuck to on Friday (the day before the qualifiers) with 2k on my wallet and if you think I will waste the time of my life trying to save 20k in one night  (FOR THE QUALIFIERS BUY-IN), you are WRONG! I'm done with this game, it sucks badly. I almost had a panic attack from having to go back to Friday and hearing the same BS dialogue over and over again. What is this? The groundhog day or what? This is just pure insanity. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!


Final score: 3.0 (on a good day).  This game is basically random people calling and pressing you all the time for more money like your life depends on it, while simultaneously being trapped in a time loop just like the groundhog day. BIG NOPE.",1707973275,1708030048,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only reason i bought this was because of the 86% off, not worth paying full price as the game does not receive new content.

Verdict: Good game brings the classic feel back to NFS, The art style can be annoying at sometimes but is fine because you mostly see cars throughout the game, Exorbitant price tag for a game that isn't even new anymore and not receiving new content therefore impacting the point of getting the game, only buy this game on sale.   67/100",1708003373,1708003411,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For me, the worst part of this game is the bad dialogue and obviously nobody gave a shit about the voice acting, I would actually rather there was just zero storyline at all. Because it detracts from what is working with this game. 

Saw someone say they dislike the soundtrack, yeah it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but I actually really enjoyed it. Turn down the music in settings and play your own music, a reasonable solution for a racing game. 

The campaign is a little bit annoying because it kind of doles out the missions in ""days"" and ""nights"" where only a handful of races are available to restricted car tiers, so, you only are able to participate in *some* of the missions if you do not have the right car for the events. No way to tweak your car on the fly for drifting versus grip events, so until you have an arsenal of cars you are inevitably leaving cash on the table. If you happen to step away from the controller without pausing the game, RIP you just got busted by a passing cop and lost 30 thousand dollars. So... there's some work to be done here IMO. However the way the campaign is structured is intended to make the pace of progression a little slower which I do appreciate. 

Where this game really shines is the ""arcade"" vibes of the driving mechanics. It's got a nice balance of realism and ""impossible"" driving, which just makes this a fun time. There are sick little challenges around every corner, plenty of collectables which have worthwhile rewards for collecting them all, and the open world is littered with huge jumps and flows very nicely which makes the cop chases satisfying to evade. Adding to this arcade feel are some dope driving animations called ""tags"" that I would describe as like ""anime super powers"" for your car, a pretty unique visual flair that I have not seen before and can be turned off if you don't like them--for example if you take a jump, huge illustrated wings spawn around your car... neat!

The cars, as per usual with NFS, are real brands/models, very well rendered and highly customizable down to the colour of your headlights and the sound of your exhaust note. Though performance-tweaking wise it left a little to be desired, look to forza horizon latest games if you want to know what good performance customisation looks like. The basics are there but I found myself wishing to make the tweaks/refinements to prevent my car from over-steering, no tire pressure either.

It runs super smooth on my 3080 ti, ultra settings at 2k

For literally $12.59 (CAD) this is actually a solid recommend for any racer addict. Though you would be rightfully unimpressed if you paid the full ticket price.

I regret buying it for full price, but I don't regret having it.

[h2] Pros [/h2]

- Gameplay is addicting and pretty competitive online. Each car behaves uniquely and thus you have to adapt and use that to your advantage. the new Boost-NOS mechanic is also a huge W. It adds an element of strategy when racing and is super satisfying when you get the hang of it.

- Need For Speed customization, Pretty self-explanatory.

- I didn't like the colorful ""tag"" effects you can put on your car at first, but they've really grown on me. Being able to customize them individually for each car is also nice. They also affect the color of your NOS which is pretty cool.

[h2] Cons [/h2]

- As mentioned above, although all cars have unique handling, some are seemingly made for drifting, no matter how much you try to tune them for grip-racing. Pretty annoying when you want to turn and your car ends up 90 degrees into a wall.

- Along with Toyota, Audi is also not present this time around. Soooo no R8. Some rims from previous entries are also no longer present.

- No reset button.

- It's baffling, but your wrap library is limited to 100 wraps. So in theory, if you own every single car, you can only have wraps on 100 of them.

- No custom-symbol creator. Want to save time and plaster some custom-made decals? Gonna have to do it the old school way. Tediously.

- Cops are either useless, or frustrating. No in-between. You either evade them when you don't want to, or you can't evade them and get 1-tapped by SWAT trucks when they lightly brush up against your car.

- The legendary cars that were free in Heat (Eddie's R34, Rachel's 350z, etc.) are now pay-walled this time around. Gotta love EA.",1707863874,1707863874,True,45,1,0.776206672191619873,2,True,False,False

The cops are especially fun to outrun in this game, as their intensity ramps up more linearly and their tactics feel more fair than they have in the past.

Up until now, it was hard to find a NFS game that appealed to me, but gave this game a try after getting it on sale (and checking my fair share of reviews) and i am finding it delightfully refreshing! 

Maybe it is because I am an artist, but i actually really like the art direction im seeing with this game so far. It's fun, it's creative! It's really nice to see. And while I haven't got too deep into car customization yet, the array of varied decal options is equally as fun. There's just something that feels good about being able to stick a tiny pride flag decal in my car's windows along with some cool skulls... and on that subject, I hadn't seen much about this looking into the game, bu I also appreciate how flexible the character creator feel is when you get into it. Sure you can start with some default models and the over all library of features isn't anything too complex, but beyond that being able to make you character as binary or nonbinary as you please is just the cherry on the cake.

Oh, and of course i spent far too much of by first 4 hours just trying to drive the roads like a normal person going unnoticed like i do in Most Wanted. Never gets old.

Unfortunately, I haven't finished the game just yet since I love customizing cars (at least 50% of my hours go to that), but I will say that the story, so far, is lamer than Heat's, and the bar is not high at all. As for everything else, well, it's great, but whatever, let's put it simply:

[b]PROS[/b]
- Fun to play when you get home and want to turn your brain off or sweat to grind money.
- Great visuals (I don't mind the cartoon designs and the cars' SFX)
- Great customization, vehicle choices and decals (still no Supra tho, thanks Toyota)
- Drift builds are not the only viable option unlike in previous titles
- Cop chases, although too frequent, are very fun and fairly rewarding.

[b]CONS[/b]
- The soundtrack is awful. I do like some, but most of them are huge misses. I see what they're trying to do, incorporating more lesser known/diverse artists, but it feels forced. The music, for a game of this caliber, is not good.
- Once again, to expand on this: [b]Cop chases[/b] are WAY too frequent. I absolutely love the idea of the different types of cop cars, helicopter counter-play, etc. It is genuinely miles ahead, but it is so, so, so repetitive and happens so often that it turns into a neutral leaning towards a negative, because you will get sick of it.
- For some, limiting retries during a day/night cycle can be extremely restricting. For me, it's a fun challenge, so I don't mind it. Polarizing to say the least.

[b]Price[/b]
For $70+? Too much. No game, unless it's GTA 6 or something else that is groundbreaking, should be this much.
For $60? The industry standard. Still too much, but if you love racing games, go for it.
For $50? Honestly, I believe this is a fair price and should be the actual price. Tons of value for $50 if you like cars, racing games or NFS in general.
For $40 or less? Worth it. Absolutely.",1707791635,1707791635,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

That being said, this game is absolutely fucking horrendous because the gameplay is terrible. The rivals are complete non-characters, non of them exist outside of maybe one event and the races. The difficulty is all over the place with the game opting to not be difficult, but instead be blatantly rigged, if they don't want you to win, YOU WILL NOT WIN. 

I have seen cops spawn directly in front of me to act as impromptu roadblocks to forcefully set me back in a race that I might have won on, cops will objectively target you for no reason during many races, and a lot of the time, if you're making too much money or having too much fun, enemy racers will literally speed up to WAY higher than their max speed just to put you in your place and prevent you from having fun. You can win a race and still lose, just because the game decides that you aren't allowed to enjoy it, this usually happens when the game forcefully rubberbands someone ahead of you without reason, even if you prevent them from passing you and win the race, the game will count it as a loss because it's quite literally forcing the loss. 

The beginning of the game is a gigantic slog, earning money and spending it immediately after so that you can maybe make your car faster or turn better only to still lose due to the obnoxious rubberbanding is absolutely soul-crushing. Many of the races are repeated and recycled, and a lot of the time you're forced to do drift events instead of those races which are even less fun because you're literally just drifting around a small track 3 times in a row while all alone and hoping you get enough points to land first place.

As much as I hope these issues will be fixed, I know they won't, because this is a blatant attempt at finally slitting the throat of the game series that is ""Need For Speed."" This game, what with it's insanely terrible launch timing and with the fact that it was shadow-launched without any advertisement whatsoever, save maybe one or two trailers on youtube, is very obviously just supposed to be the final nail in the coffin of a beloved series that EA wants so desperately to abandon.",1707788043,1707788043,False,2,0,0.544364511966705322,0,True,False,False

However, i will say that the story is pretty bland, some parts were great but the writing in this is terrible especially the conversation between you and the npcs. I also wish there was more variety then getting chased by cops constantly (it's almost impossible to shake them off),

The only other thing that bugged me was the music, not my cup of tea so I just muted it and just had Spotify on.

Overall, if you just want a fun race about online/offline and enjoy designing cars then I would highly recommend but if you like story depth or realistic racing/driving then I'd suggest a different need for speed game!",1707764759,1707764759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Buy it on sale
- MUTE IN GAME MUSIC
- MUTE IN GAME CHARACTER SPEECH

I'll say right off the bat, the music in this game is by long and far the worst soundtrack I've ever heard in any game. It is absolutely unbearable. Similarly, the character speech is terrible. There's always some tik tok influencer sounding kid yapping your ears off literally the whole game - to a point where even having JUST SUBTITLES on is ANNOYING. 

Put on a soundtrack from literally any other racing game, and have some fun. Because the gameplay is actually quite fun. It improves upon lots of things from NFS Heat. Unlike Forza, you're not just given high end cars right at the beginning. You need to work your way up, and it feels like a challenge for the first 2ish weeks. Cops are tough too. Love it.
They've implemented boost really well, and the anime style effects will grow on you - it's a full arcade game after all.

Sort of just a nit-pick, but it's a bit frustrating calling some of the events 'Takeovers' - the literal thing killing the car scene irl. I get that it's not the same thing, but even just the title is only increasing the attention those clowns get.

Overall, OK game. Mute the music and characters and you'll have fun with the gameplay

Also, even if the police is already far away behind you, after the race is over they will spawn right behind you, they always force you to HAVE that police chase after almost every race, at least give us some escape alternatives like we do in MW.
I'm pretty sure that nothing will change with the next NFS, hopelully these negative reviews will open their eyes to try to make a decent game next time.

Lets start with the cons of the game.
1. The Grip, 
The grip system in this game is extremely fragile, and doesn't actually like it when you are moving quickly. In S+ tier races, you will often find yourself randomly losing grip and sliding off the course and crashing, even when moving completely straight. 
2. The Restarts,
The game gives you only a few restarts per ""day cycle"". Even with the maximum restarts, you only get 10 per cycle. Want to go for a best time or keep getting smashed by BS? Sucks bro. Nearly every race makes you pay to get into it as well, so if you lose all your restarts, you just lose the money. 100k for a race to enter? Guess what, you have to grind all that again. 
3. The Money,
The money in this game is INCREDIBLY limited, and getting a large amount requires you to farm only super high heat races. EVERYTHING costs money to do, even to race. Most races you have to pay into cost between 3k and 12k just to enter, and then you have to make sure you win, which is another issue I will discuss. 
4. The Difficulty,
The difficulty spike in this game is really odd, as in it is very hard at the start, and very easy in the late game, at least when it comes to the AI. The difficulty for the police also follows this format, as they are really difficult to get away from early on, but late game they are borderline self destructive, and will fling themselves off cliffs for no reason, which is really funny to watch, so that's a plus. 
5. The Nitrous,
The nitrous in this game may as well not even be there, as it is so incredibly under powered that you will barely even notice it with acceleration. The recharge is probably the worst that I've ever seen from an NFS title that has it. Without driving in oncoming, the bar will take about 5 minutes to fully recharge, and is spent in about 5 seconds. The burst nitrous is a cool mechanic, it decays too fast to be useful unless its after a turn. 

Now, the pros. 
1. The story,
I personally liked the story, because while yes, its just a dulled version of a revenge plot, the characters, (specifically Rydell) are wonderful. The player character seems to be an all around likeable person, and will openly comment with other NPCs about the events of the game. I like this touch, as it makes the protagonist seem less like an avatar and more like an actual element of the story. 
2. The cars,
This game has a good amount of cars to choose from if you've got the money for it. While yes, some are locked behind a paywall, a good majority of them are available from the get go, only restriction being money.  The customisation is the same as NFS Heat, so if you liked that, you'll like this. 
3. The tuning. 
The tuning in this game is very simple and easy to understand for people who don't know how to tune cars in racing games. All the while it makes a good difference in how your car will behave, and can allow you to make interesting builds. 
4. The mini games,
The side objectives in this game are oddly enough one of my favourite parts of the game. While most races give you a heat level, these do not, and they can offer as much if not more money than a lot of actual mainline races. Unlocking safe houses by escorting stranded racers is a great way to make them unlockable without having to buy them or win them. The vehicle deliveries and custom car pursuits are also a fun way to get money and not worry about getting to heat level 5. 
5. The Police,
The cops in this game are such a treat as they are psychotic as ever, but twice as reckless and will do the funniest things to try and get to you. It provides a much needed laugh in a potentially high stress situation. Such things include flying off of cliffs or ramps, swerving headfirst into a wall, ramming into each other, ramming into traffic, running into their own spike strips, and losing you while being right next to you. 

Some reviews I've read have poked fun at or hated the cartoonish art style of the game and the car effects, but honestly they aren't an issue since you can just unequip them in the car style menu. No option to turn off the blackened sides of the screen, which is a bummer, but oh well. Overall I would give this game a solid 6 out of 10. And seeing as NFS hasn't released a good title since the 2000's, I'd say that's pretty good.",1707615690,1707615690,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EA is just so barf that everything they touch smells bad, it is really too bad because this game is fun, but EA clearly cares more about controlling you and your mind than making a good game; they even put face masks on their NPCs to help train your subconscious.

Why don't they just focus on making good games?

Meet-ups are fun, out running the cops together is likely why I play this game at all, and I hope the next games make this the main focuses instead of racing.

Multiplayer - 7/10 The position you start in is the position you finish in during a good race so since you don't all start in a straight line it is totally luck who wins; I am not sure what determines the starting position, I think it is random and it is terrible. Timing the boost at the start is way too important and it makes the game worse than not having it at all in my opinion. 

Single Player - 5/10  -5 for forcing you to be online.
I don't know how to start a new game which would be nice.

Sound effects - 10/10 wish there were more car sounds effect add ons

Music and sound track 0/10 will make your ears bleed just turn it off, the Artist aren't even that bad but the songs they choice are.

After some time, it's gotten a bit better, many things are still bad tho.

As usual, overhyping trailer, mid game.
However it's got them Spiderverse aeshtetics, which is nice.
The new effects on smoke from the tires is horrible but thankfully can be turned off now.
(Nevermind, it's bugged, of course)

Singleplayer is the only part of the game where you can kind of choose to race during day or night, in multiplayer it's constant day unless a race turns it to night, which is annoying because you don't know what's coming nor how the track looks.

On the topic of night time, the road is very poorly lit up when compared to NFS 2015 and Heat, which doesn't help because if a race is a high tier race such as S or higher, you'll be driving at 300 km/h basically blind.

Drifting while hitting the destructible cones in linkups needs to be removed again.

AFK players still farm XP and Money in online races by standing still, they need to be punished.
Same with players who leave mid race, if you baby rage and leave because you had an accident on the road and are now passed by the guy in last place, you deserve some sort of ban from racing for a while.

The V key needs to be unbound and rebound to another key or let me rebind it myself.
It has made me lose so many damn races because I accidentally clicked it.
It was also my Nitrous button in every previous NFS game and now I have to use B instead, not fun.

Electric cars are a joke and should never have been added.

Should have given some head to Audi and have their cars stay in this and future NFS games, Toyota will never return sadly.
At least we have Bugatti again.

The major negative for me personally is that no matter what car you're driving, if you hold down the throttle button after a second or so, the game automatically lowers the volume of the engine, every single time.

The backfire effects are also not as detailed as the ones from Heat, nor do they sound very cool.

Honorable mention: 
Every S+ race is aids, not only do a lot of the tracks have unneeded and annoying turns all one after the other (races with a steep hill and needing to go downwards side to side), they are also the reason why I hate the civilian collisions.
Specifically the S+ ''Apex Predator'' race track, absolute garbage.
Their design is just so horrible and unfun to race in.
There's also an overabundance of civilians during any time all the time.
I can ram headfirst into cops and be unscathed, but if I dare to touch a civvie at basically any speed I would be flipped.

As for visuals, I literally cannot play this game without Reshade shaders, the game's colors are just so ugly and monotone to look at and for once the piss filter works wonders.

Even the cops, there is only one new type which is the Ford F-150, the rest are basically the same ones from Heat, a little variety would be nice there.

But the reason this review turned from positive to negative is the wraps and effects glitches.
In multiplayer, cars' wraps get glitched out and only one side is loaded in while the other is missing or is turned into the default black color.

I thought it only happened on certain cars but no.
I recently tinkered with my Mustangs body, changed the bumper and added a spoiler.
After I finished I went out, selected a different car and then went back to the said Mustang, only for one side of the wrap to be glitched.
No matter what I did it would not fix itself, even after buying another Mustang and just applying the wrap without any modifications, the problem is still present.

They also recently added the normal original smoke effects as an option, NOT AS DEFAULT, and when I would get out of a race, those effects would change back to the DEFAULT which isn't the one I selected.

I've already complained about this on EA's Bug Reports and stuff, but I doubt it will get fixed, until then, this review stays a Negative.",1675304143,1707523435,False,0,0,0.523384332656860352,0,True,False,False

Edit 2024: Found a way to play it but honestly, this game isn't worth any money or whatever.

2/10 -  Maybe for 2$ the complete edition, but no more than 2$ as this game is a pure waste of time, why can't they simply make more like Need For Speed: Most Wanted (2005) or even Underground (1 and 2)?

1. not having a save game system where you can have multiple saves
2. a dumb day/night 7 day a week progression system that gives players a limited amount of attempts to give fake stakes and make the game harder than it should
3. limited restarts

I wouldn't mind point 2 and 3 if the game actually had a save game system that allows me to create multiple profiles and manually save progressions, at this point it's like EA is removing quality of life features to make the game seem harder and prevent the ability of players to make attempts at improving themselves on playing the game

NFS Unbound is not worth full price, ever (even if you have a full 4+ man squad you plan to play with).

This game is missing a ton of QoL features that were previously implemented in NFS Heat. Like A TON. Without going into absurd detail, one of my biggest gripes with this game is how absolutely LIMITED the amount of races are. It quickly feels like you're doing the same 5 races over, and over, and over. To top it off, they locked majority of the cars behind absurd requirements, FORCING replay-ability. It's very uneventful and boring to have to complete 30 Tier B PLAYLISTS (playlist = 3 races, with much worse load times than Heat since you CAN'T skip the race intro cutscene like you can in Heat) in a specific make of car (like BMW, for example). It forces you to do the same boring playlist 30 times in the same slow car... No thanks.

The game is also VERY stingy with earnings compared to Heat, and it's VERY punishing to purchase new cars or parts that you wanna test out. Even using the best money-making tactics in-game, I'm often wayyy to afraid to purchase an engine swap or vehicle that costs any more than $100k to find out if it's good or not. Because in the event that the car drives poorly or can't reach a 400+ rating, it means I just wasted at minimum like $450k (assuming I sell the vehicle in which case you get exactly 50% of what you spent in total on the vehicle) which is almost 2 hrs of playing optimally. You can't resell parts like in heat, nor can you put them on other vehicles like you can in heat. FAR too punishing to test things out. I spent over $850k on a 60's Camaro (one of my irl dream cars), and it fails to get even close to a 400+ rating and drives like actual dog water. The reason? The most expensive engine swap for the car does not come with any suitable gear box. So I'm stuck with like a V10 or w.e it is and a gearbox that I can only choose either 2, 3, or 4 gears in.... It spins out in first for literally (I timed it) 7.5 seconds before going into 2nd, among other issues. There goes hours of playing because God forbid I wanted to test out the upgrading system in the game and mess around.

Heat also allows players to progress through the actual story mode/campaign together.. A true gem of a feature, and sadly, this has been completely removed in NFS Unbound. Just another way that this game is a downgrade from the previous installment.

Lastly, for those interested in the solo story, it's cringe as all hell. I promise NFS if you hire me I would do a much, much better job than whoever y'all used because the story mode conversation does not flow or sound like a normal/real conversation AT ALL lol.

It is a nice racing experience but the day night circles are just atrocious cause the last week you don't even need to play since you have more then enough money to go around.
The daily challenges are easier then the night ones.
One of the main frustration that I personally found in the game is that you can drive your best lap and still not win due to someone (usually the cops) ramming into you at the finish line you need to play the whole thing again.
Also the heat system is kinda fun at the beginning but after the first week it just starts becoming boring and repetitive.
Is it a good game? Yes it is.
Is it worth 70$? No, it isn't.

The story is barebones but with slight hints at being good which hurts it even more in the end.

The map feels kinda boring/bland. I guess it's kinda hard to make a map inspired by Chicago interesting. 

The car list is really similar to Heat (which is fine). The tuning is also extremely similar to Heat with the exception of the ""comic effects"" for tire smoke and such (which I really like but I can definitely see it being annoying to others).

The handling model is superior to Heat and one of my favorites in the series overall (cars being tuned for grip are actually playable this time).

The progression is what NFS was in the past years which is good. It's one of the only things this franchise gets right nowadays.

Overall, the game is fine which is kinda the most dissapointing thing about it. It's a game that's showing so much promise with most of its gameplay mechanics but they're just not refined enough to leave a lasting impression. This makes Unbound feel like an inferior version of Heat which is really dissapointing considering that we might not see a new entry in this franchise for a while.

This game probably needs a more powerful GPU to run smoothly at 60 FPS on high settings. 

The game should have told me not to sell all cars from every class, I didn't know that the final week races require cars from A, A+, S & S+ categories, I made a mess in the end and left the game incomplete. But I shall return in the future with a better GPU to finish it.

The Highs:
-Graphics: wow
-Customizations: Hold my bumper.
-Racing: AI are more engaging with the addition of class tiers.
-Cars: Bugatti, Urus, Countach, C8, etc... what more could you want?
-Physics & Handling: Kinda similar to Heat in some ways, but even better with grip and drift tuning.
-RSR nerfed: Not that broken anymore!
-Hellcat: Yeehaw!!
-Cops: Just better and makes more sense than Heat. In Heat, the three cop cars are okay and weak, fast and tough, faster and tougher. In Unbound, you can actually play with them by ramming, going off-road, or tricking them, but they're weak against minor collisions.

The Lows:
-Audi and Toyota: What happened to them?
-The absence of Off-Road Racing.
-Some cool small features removed, I'm not gonna get to details here.

The Mids:
-Soundtrack: At least an improvement to Heat
-Story: Longer than Heat, but it doesn't have the thrill of actually being a movie character, and the dialogues are quite cringe
-Economy: Earning money in Story is more strict, events are only available to its time in the day (For example, an A-Class Drift Race is only available in Tuesday at daytime, you won't be able to see that event at other times of the week.) Maybe they're are preventing people doing the same race over and over...
-Driving Effects: You can't completely turn them off, but it won't interfere with you when cruising at 50mph.
-Crown Vic: Not being a part of LPD, but instead of a drivable player car.

What and When to Buy:
You should just get the Standard Edition, because the Palace cars still require in-game money to buy, they're not in your garage when you jump in. The EA App version is better because you still need the app to play the game and if you're considering buying it, it's best to buy it when it's on sale.


Conclusion:
NFS Unbound is a great base game as a whole. Since Volume 2 the game's online finally got some attention, it's an okay game in terms of story, but if you're looking for an online experience, definitely give this a try!

Volume 5 Update: I'm glad they still care about the game and community, This is the longest post-launch support we've had in NFS ever!


Some Cop Tips (If you even get this far):

Freeroam - Avoid them by smashing, sideswiping, speeding past them (Keep in mind at higher Heat, they spot you faster), taking a different route, or by hiding with your engine off. There is also an auxiliary item called Undercover Racer, which doubles the time the cops take to spot you.


Heat 1 - Patrol Dodge Chargers: Slow and fragile, by that I mean really with 470hp, they're probably using 30% of their throttle. You can get rid of them by ramming, driving fast, or confusing them with alleyways, U-turns, and jumps.

Heat 2 - AWD Ford Explorers: Slightly faster than the Chargers, tougher, and does better off-road. You can get rid of them by again driving fast, confusing, or ramming them, but it takes longer to disable it.

Heat 3 - Interceptor Corvettes - Fast, agile, and very focused on-road, they also like to drive in front of you, giving you Burst NOS, and brake checking. You can get rid of them by ramming, driving them into traffic cars, walls, or going off-road.
Roadblocks - Blocks the road with Chargers with gaps and sometimes with spike strips, they will often crash into their own roadblocks and spikes, causing them to crash.

Heat 4 - Undercover Camaros - Hidden from scanner in Freeroam, only when it's in pursuit, and slightly slower than the Corvettes. You can get rid of them by ramming (Though they're tougher to takedown), PIT maneuvering them, or by using the Undercover Racer auxiliary part to avoid them in Freeroam.
Roadblocks - Same as Heat 3 but Chargers are replaced with Heavy Raptors
Helicopters - Sees you from the sky, takes much longer than the ground units to spot you. You can lose them from them by hiding under tunnels, obstacles, and turning off your engine, or just keep running until they run out of fuel.

Heat 5 - SWAT Ford Raptors: Toughest of the bunch, deals a lot of damage, faster than it looks, has poor handling. You can get rid of them by taking sharp turns, U-turning, swerving through traffic, until they crash, or ramming it from the back.
Roadblocks- Heavy Raptors fully blocking the road with small gaps between.
A second helicopter will sometimes be called in to assist.

The Good: 

It's a lot of fun, and that's the bottom line with an arcade racer. The city especially feels exciting to race through. The roads and motorways are well populated with traffic, jumps, billboards and police - there's even a train or two. The pedestrians add some much needed life, and so does the changing weather. 
The day night cycle is more evenly balanced than Heat where the temptation was to spend ages in cop-free daytime and speed through night as quick as possible. (And this time there isn't a speedway where you just go round and round grinding out money at maximum heat without being caught). There's some genuine peril, and tactics to the cop chases and there are literally stakes to the races, (even if any chase can be stopped by quitting and reloading - thankfully, if you have a real life you need to get back to) 

The art style seems like a gimmick but works quite well in practice, a bit of a pity they didn't do more with it - especially when there are so many other appearance mods the 'effects' feel limited. Audi, Tesla and Toyota apart most of the usual suspects are still around. There's not nearly as many cars as some other games but at some point the law of diminishing returns starts to hit anyway. At least this game each car has a proper set of visual mods to it and you genuinely do get a different experience from car to car. 

The burst nitrous, grip turn and drafting dynamic is well implemented, it is nice to have some genuine nods to real-life racing skills like cornering and slipstreaming, so the races aren't simply a test of reactions. Likewise the car mods make you think a bit about what result you want to get, since the opposition are pleasingly tough. The inevitable rubberbanding isn't too obnoxious, though there are moments when it seems like the game is going to force you to lose no matter what. For example; make a minor error later in the race and end up a close second, no matter how much drafting and nitro burst you save, they keep ahead. 

Thr Bad: 

The single player campaign is very repetitive and has some unfortunate mechanics that stifle the game somewhat. Every 'Meetup' event brings in some kind of heat, and you always have to resume the chase with whatever car you raced, so the B and A class events (and cars) become increasingly pointless other than for the qualifiers. You don't earn enough to justify ending the day segment with Level 5 Heat and helicopters everywhere. Yet mindlessly looning around the jumps and speed runs earns no police attention whatsoever. 

There's so many cars in the game but realistically there's not much purpose in collecting because they are so expensive. It's a racing and customisation game but you end up cherry picking the best races and having a limited garage stocked mostly with the prize cars, saving money for the performance mods - because you are going to need them. It's also frustrating that the car handling bar cannot be adjusted between race resets, so go in an discover the car is all over the place then you're stuck with it. And multiplayer is separated away in it's own world that might as well be another title. 

The map does feel a lot like the one in Heat, from the city layout to the generic arcadey racetrack, the industrial zone to the hills, tunnels and the high viaducts. Almost like a re-skin of the Heat map. Technically it can't be faulted, but feels unmemorable and unimaginative in places. The map tab comes up quite a bit because it can be hard to remember or recognise where you are. The Chicago-alike skyline and neighbourhoods are true to life but it all begs the question don't developers want to create their own skyscrapers, bridges and landmarks rather than copy reality all the time. 

Not that it matters too much, but the story and characters aren't amazing (it almost goes without saying). The rotoscoped look seems wasted on another bunch of 'youths' copy and pasted out of a second rate hip hop video. Are young people really this boring or is it just in media?

However with all that being said I dig this game a whole lot. Obviously I am biased as I grew up being a Need For Speed fan, so I am definitely the target audience, but man the game hasn't looked this beautiful since 2015 and the gameplay feels just nice for an arcade racer. It also has a visual flair that many understandably aren't a fan of, but I grew to like it for how much personalization it brings for your visual customization. And while Its singleplayer very quickly turns stale post-story, the multiplayer remains a lively experience with lots of full 16-player lobbies. One big part of how I like to enjoy modern NFS titles are to make my own wraps, show them off, and see others do the same, and the wrap making options and selections remain a great many. The game also still receives somewhat frequent updates which is a treat, it has decent replay value if you enjoy the multiplayer aspect of the game.

7,5 of 10 
I
Long story short, if You liked NFS Undeground series, Most wanted and etc. - this is theirs successor, but more challenging. 

What I liked:
cars tuning and upgrade system;
cars behavior; the sense of speed the game gives;
sound;
art and style; graphics.
it runs good on steam deck:)

What I didn't like:
narrow amount of different tracks;.
no fast travel.

neutral:
difficulty;
""poor"" open world;  
story; 
music. 


story
one more story in a row of stories ""how to lose it all and get it all back in a month"". But, there are  story, script, characters whose traits and motivations are clear and revealed as the plot progresses. The screenwriter had the main task of making the characters come alive, and I think it worked out. You will remember the characters and distinguish them, which is already an achievement for a racing game. But this game is mostly about gameplay, so.

Gameplay
quite repetitive, but it gives you good feeling of your progress and mastering the game. You'll have 4 ""chapters"" (weeks). each chapter consists of 5 episodes (days), each of wich is divided in two sessions: daytime and nighttime. At the end of each chapter there's chapter finale of 3 or 4 races with a car of requied class.
Main goals of each week are to earn money, and prepare a car of requied class for week's finale and win in it. Each session is a open world gameplay with limited amount of different races for cars of different classes. There you'll find simple circut races, standart races and its variations like ""corner king"", 2 types of drift races and long ""endurance"" races. 
And there the developers introduced a number of restrictions that make the game quite difficult and unfriendly from the very beginning of the game:
- difficulty. prepare to suffer.:) the first quarter of the game you're just surviving)  Don't even think about exiting your garage on stock car: great chance you won't be able to hit top 5. Invest every penny you have in upgrading your car. Opponents are tough. At first, it is very difficult to take at least some top place with a tangible cash prize. I even had to reduce the difficulty level to minimum and even so it was very difficult to reach prize place. At the same time, in previous NFS games I easily played on hard and did not have such a challenge.
 - money: there will always be a shortage of money. The situation changes a little towards the end of the game, but you still have to live to see it. You need money to pay for participation in races, expensive spare parts, garage upgrades and cars. The further you are from first place, the less you will earn, and maybe you will not earn anything or go into the red. There is also the betting system where you can bet that you will overtake a racer of your choice. Which helps you hedge your results. But if you lose, you lose that money too.
- heat. almost every race you take grants you ""heat level"" witch upgrades police agression and cars, raising risks of being arrested. At maximal 5th level police is almost everywhere and start chasing you in seconds they see you. With upgrades you can reduce the time of being recognized, but it costs money, which is already so little. 
- car class and upgrades. You raise car class by upgrading it or buying new car of higher class ""in stock"". You can use car only of those class the race require. 
you should upgrade wisely and keep track of the car's class during the upgrade so as not to jump into the next class and thus lose opportunity to take races.
- limited amount of restarts. Yeah, now you can restart limited times a day, so save restarts for the most expensive races. In some tracks you will have to go to the end, even if you lose, in order to get at least a penny. Since simply leaving the event will cost you the entry fee for participation. 
So, there you have it: little money, limited restarts,  challenging opponents, angry cops, risk of losing all earned in session,  and need to think what car and for whar purpose you're uprading right now. Once,  I spent all my money to upgrade a car, that, as it turned out after, was useless for me, it didn't give me boost i was hoping for.

As for arcade, developers managed give  to player good and exiting driving experience conveying a sense of the car's weight, speed and how it handles on the road. 
Over the course of the game, you improve your own skills simultaneously purchasing and upgrading cars. And the presence of tracks for different classes of cars in one session gives you diversity. The game becomes more interesting and faster, with much more higher speeds, from the second half.
Remember, you don't need to participate in all races. If you have car of requied class you're confident in and enough money, just skip  through garages to week's finale. 

Graphics and style. 
I find the combination of good graphics and cell shading of characters and effects to be very apt and memorable. The effects do not interfere with the gameplay and, on the contrary, additionally give an understanding of the behavior of one's own car and the cars of opponents. You will not confuse or forget the graphic design of this game.

Open world.
the game could easily have been implemented without an open world. But where would we be nowadays without open worlds? 
The map of the city and surrounding area seems large, but in reality it does not provide a really wide variety of routes and situations. The number of tracks in the story mode is small, despite the seemingly great possibilities, which is a little boring. On the other hand, this allows you to learn these routes and fly them over at high speeds in the last stages of the game. Without knowing the routes, you simply won’t have time to react.  That being said, there are many bypasses and hidden passages that could be used for interesting track design solutions. But for some reasons they weren't 
 used by developers.
 The city itself isn't particularly interesting either. At the first stages of the game, it generally seems to be extinct because there are few cars on the roads. By the last stages there are many more cars. And to add liveliness, they added pedestrians who constantly jump out from under the wheels :) But at the same time, the entire open world is crammed with various events and collectibles that you can always entertain yourself with on the way from one race to another. By the way, there is no fast travel in the game, which is sometimes frustrating.

Sound and music
My opinion sound is good. And music. Well you just have to accept that this is todays' modern music. It's not 2004 anymore:)  And this music suits game's artistic design quiet well.",1706544862,1706547293,True,88,4,0.775325596332550049,0,True,False,False

Fun racing, a bit more arcadey than things like Forza, F1, etc etc. Plus, the style change seemed awesome. I love the mix of realism and comic, as well as all the effects from driving and boosting. But that's where my excitement ends.

When you get into the game, the 'prologue' is really fun. You have a decent car (of your choice between 3-4 I believe) that performs decently and can be upgraded to where you FEEL like a racer. It's FUN, it's fast, and it's just what I love.

And then the prologue ends. Without spoilers, you're left with an, essentially, bottom of the barrel car that they have unnecessarily made worse than it actually should be, for artificial difficulty. Pontiac Firebird in this game as you get it? Feels like I'm driving a Prius half the time. The AI? Always either blows you away or is just barely faster than your. Or, worse, they're slightly behind until you make one single mistake (which is easy, with the police seemingly only targeting you) and then they take off, never to be caught again.

This game drops you into the fire where you're meant to lose, lose, and lose. Until, with enough patience maybe, you get a car upgraded enough (difficult with the piss-poor money you'll be making) that you can start really moving.

I, however, do not have the patience do that.",1706516046,1706516046,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics look great and immerse you into the game while also taking your breathe away. Now to the downsides, the NPC's and AI in this game need a huge tweak as even with a higher power level and more HP then all opponents i still find myself getting left in the dust every round on normal mode.

-Calendar system is a mess. No option to swap vehicles at Garages without having to Bank Cash and skip to next day, and resume the current day
-Heat Buildup is insane! You can go from Heat 2 to 5 after two races!
-Restart managing is a must. Don't Choke. I wasted 2 restarts cause of Traffic/Cop placement towards the end
-How FREQUENT Police spawns everywhere from you
-Undercover Cops spotting you off the radar while travelling to another Race Event or Hideout is ridiculous
-No Pursuit Breakers
-No Cooldown Hiding Spots like in Most Wanted/Carbon when escaping
-You literally spend more time being chased for 20 Minutes than racing for 2 Minutes

Having spent almost hours building up that hard earned cash only to get busted by Aggressive Cops is a complete total waste of time.

I gave a chance to this game but there is a lot of bad stuff in singleplayer. Before talking a little about it i need to say that I played the game on the hardest difficulty so maybe some of these comments does not apply for lower difficulties. I am going to write pros and cons from my point of view:
PROS:
1. There is people walking on the street! That amazed me. It was about time to have a NFS with living streets and not just ghost towns. No, you cannot run over people. They remind me of MidTown Madness, they are like holograms that act like you are running on them but nothing happens.
2. Nice graphics.
3. The car decals and vanity items are very wide and you can do very good stuff.
4. I haven't unlocked all cars yet but looks like there are more than in NFS heat. Which is kind of cool.
5. Driving is easy. Which is the expected from an arcade game.
6. When you are driving, some random mission pop up and you can make extra money. That is cool.
7. Police radio calls are more professional than heat, that is something I didn't like from the previous game. It felt like you were running from kids (in NFS heat).
8. The ""anime"" kind of graphics is interesting. It is not bad, is just different and I think is good to have something different in NFS regarding world environment.
9. Races are now organized in events where all racers meet and then you choose what race is next. That is very good and it makes more sense than having all the races spread throughout the city and drive from one to another.

CONS:
1. Car heat is on you, not on your cars. It doesn't matter if you change your car, the police already transfers the heat 5 from your S+ car to your B car. Which make no sense as they are different cars.
2. If you go to the garage, the day finishes. This is very upsetting. So let's say you have 200K in money and the police heat is 5 on your car. You want to go to the garage to save the money so you can continue racing whatever you need to. Well, if you go to the garage the day/night is over and the calendar moves to the next day of events. In NFS heat you could control at what time did you want the day or night finishing. Like, I just ran 1 race, how I am going to the garage and having the day finished?
3. The NPC racers are always the same. Like, they didn't have many ideas about NPCs and they decided to just repeat NPCs and cars through all the game.
4. Music is bad. As always there are 3 or 4 songs that are OK for racing, but in general the music is bad (NFS heat music is bad too).
5. There is only a few car body mods and they do not affect performance. Not much to say here, no NFS game can compare with NFS ProStreet or Shift yet.
6. Patrol cars just spawn in front of you. I don't know if this could be hardware related or if it is a real issue from the game but sometimes, when I am hiding from the police, a random patrol just spawns in front of me.
7. The story is not very interesting. I feel it's a NFS payback remix.
8. Driving is easy. I mean is good but is bad. They should add an option to make less arcade and more sim like they did in Payback and The Run.
9. You cannot mix your singleplayer mode with online anymore. Something very good about heat is that you can play your main story and also online at the same time. In this game they made singleplayer and online into 2 different modes. I felt that is a downgrade but it may be because of the next point.

Something very interesting in the online version is the addition of a ""speed pass"", where you run and do challenges and unlock stuff in a way that is pretty similar to playing BF battlepass. That is something cool as it makes you want to play and unlock things online.

Was looking forward to another NFS from Criterion, it seemed to be a better version of Heat. The option for having cars with different handling is a welcome change, as well as using cars of different performance levels. Customization is nice, though the number of body kits is really low, you get like 3-4 for each car and they usually take away the identity, the original design of the car instead of expanding that. Graphics and sounds are nice and personally I like the cartoony art style.

The story and the lines of the characters are pure cringe, like a bunch of kindergarteners trying to one-up each other, and the fact that during a race all of them talk silly things like ""you can't beat me"" doesn't help it. 

But this is Need for Speed, so I can let that go, I'm here for the racing. If the game would let me enjoy it...

In the beginning it's very grindy as you earn little money, while performance upgrades and new cars - which are eventually required for having cars for multiple classes - are expensive. Don't dream of a nice build early on, you only get colors as the cheap option. Slowly you get to the point where the main stage of the game is happening, by then you have some money and cars. But even then, I have a feeling like I'm doing the same races over and over again.

Instead of being a fun and challenging addition, the police is a nuisance. Level 5 pursuits are frustrating. The pursuit can start anytime, in free roam, as well as in-race, and with the latter, it continues after the finish line. In a slower car, you don't even have a chance. You can' outrun them and your car would be easily wrecked, and then the race day is finished, with all your money won that day being lost. Even if you have a faster car, getting into pursuits continuously is plain annoying. When you want to sit down to play after a long day, you can't know for sure when you'll finish as lengthy pursuits can happen anytime and if you quit the game before finishing a race day, you'll lose all the money collected up to that point. 

When you get to a weekend event, which requires a hefty buy-in and you don't have the amount, you'll go back to the previous day and you need to do that again and again unless you collect the required amount. Need for Purgatory.

Most negative reviews I see for this game feel like invalid takes, but at the same time, who am I to speak? This was probably one of my most played games of 2023, but I haven't played an NFS game since Carbon for the 360, so I can't compare to see what they did better in their past entries. I got this game because illegal street racing games is something I haven't played in a long time, and Unbound definitely delivered in that sense. Customizing your cars, getting in police chases, and going to the takeovers are probably this game at its peak. The story is pretty corny and your character has the most generic sounding voice I've heard from any protagonist in a while, but its still pretty fun (and you can unlock some cool cars/body kits from it). Some of the reviews here insinuate that Unbound's story and characters were cringey and poorly written, but I don't think you should expect any award winning dialogue from a Need for Speed game. In fact (while writing this(if I remember correctly)), MOST NFS stories are cringey and poorly written. Most Wanted's story was basically a dollar store Fast & the Furious knockoff, and Underground's story just didn't need to exist. Its not saying much, but Unbound arguably has the best story out of any NFS entry. The characters actually gave me a bit of a Midnight Club 2 vibe, which is something I appreciate. Its definitely much more original than some of previous entries that come to mind. All that being said, onto why I don't recommend it.

This being an EA game, I foresaw bugs that would be neglected down the road. Missing this style of game, as well as LOVING the game's art style, I decided to buy it on the next big steam sale. Since then, many bugs were fixed to my surprise, but there are ones that have yet to be fixed. Ones that have prevented me from winning races. Those bugs on top of the crap game design are enough to make you uninstall the game, so I did. The game design functions well as a game, its the supporting designs around the game itself that need improvement. One example would be crashing. Sometimes you'll crash and flip on your side and the game can take anywhere from 2 seconds to an eternity before it realizes to respawn you because you can't drive. Another example: something knocks you off course in a race (sometimes an invisible object, a bug), usually the game would spawn you at the last checkpoint you hit, but other times it'll force you to decide to either voluntarily fuck up your fuck up even more to trigger the respawn or awkwardly reverse out of whatever shit ass spot the game put you in so you can get back on track (this flaw can also be seen in SOME of the challenges, but not all? no consistency). The design behind the traffic is also something I dislike, although I'm sure many of these complaints can be deflated by not sucking at the game (Ima say them anyway). I get that its a street racing game so of course there's gonna be traffic, but does my front bumper have a magnet attracting these drivers? dozens of times I've executed some sexy ass downhill drifts during a race, only for some fucking sedan to choose the lane I'm on, OUT OF THE 6 OTHER OPEN LANES, he chooses my fucking lane. Another traffic complaint: how come more than half of the times the racer ahead of me crashes, the car they crashed into does some weird fucking swerve directly into me? I'm honestly baffled by the amount of times this exact thing has happened. The only times it didn't, it was either a really wide road or I would miss the car by a c*nt hair. Lastly are the checkpoints. Alot of checkpoints in the inner-city races are as wide as the street and stop at the sidewalk. This cuts off what could objectively be the quicker way to turn the corner, and sometimes you can pass the checkpoint on the sidewalk if your car barely touches it. Other times it'll state you missed it. Why not just stretch the checkpoint? Part of me feels like it is designed this way to add some difficulty and realism, but the other part of me feels like they did that to ""not inherently promote vehicular manslaughter"" which feels more like the EA PR move. Those are my bulk of complaints against the game. They may seem small but after playing as long as I did, and not seeing any improvement, I've decided to quit this game for the time being. If you actually read all of this, thank you, its my first review. Below are other likes and dislikes I wanted to touch up on.

LIKES:
-Drifting (a lot of complaints against the drifting are bs, it depends on your tires/car/transmission, you just gotta see what you like and thats not gonna be done in 2 minutes of gameplay)
-Characters (yes, a little cringey but much better than some characters in past installments)
-Music (some of Unbound's tracks are straight garbage, but there are some serious bangers on this OST from genres you wouldn't expect)
-Aesthetic (if you appreciate BOTH tuner culture and graphic design such as myself, this game is for you)
-Challenging Challenges (the activities/""beating rivals"" in this actually take a good degree of skill to beat which I like more than dislike)
-A$AP Rocky (celebrity performances in games are usually hit or miss, this one felt more hit. His presence definitely helped the Midnight Club 2 vibe mentioned earlier)

DISLIKES:
-Toyota (I know its not the developer's fault, but no Supra)
-Racing (the racing doesn't suck but it gets very dull after a bit, which is not something you want from a street racing game, at least there's takeovers)
-Less takeovers (idk what it is, but I think they've updated the game so online takeovers are less frequent. Also, a lot of takeovers recently have mostly been the offroad ones which also kinda sucks)
-the Train (iykyk)
-Police (not a huge dislike, but police can sometimes feel buggy)
-Realism (I know NFS is more of an arcade racer but at what point do we question its realism? Probably when a fuckin  G-Wagon beats a kitted tf out Evo IX MR in a drift heavy 2 lap race (Apex Predator). Yes, I'm salty)
-Poor UX/UI (many bugs in Unbound's user interface, can sometimes trigger texture glitches. Also, the map interface is kinda shitty, and the camera is WAAAAY too shaky on bumpy terrains at high speeds)
-Polestar (who tf asked for this car to be here?)",1706122234,1706123330,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good
- Non-stop action day and night, unlike NFS Heat where there wasn't much going on during the day.
- Never ending cop chases. One chase after another. Awesome. I love it !
- Nice graphics (although I prefer a more realistic rather than cartoony look, it's well done).
- Nice story (although NFS games don't really need a story, just races and cop chases).
- Nice cars to upgrade to your wishes.

Negative points
- Multiplayer. I tried 2 races, but no other player wanted to race with me, so racing wasn't possible at all. Why couldn't I race bots when there are no players ? That's why I always play in story mode with only bots.

As many already said, the police are a complete joke.
I'm still in week one and get to Heat 5 by completing around 3-4 races. 
After that, driving to another race or location becomes so complicated with cops spawning everywhere the game just becomes unfun to play.
It might get easier with better cars, but im not going to waste my time grinding races that aren't that exciting either.

My first few hours were very fun with a few minor frustrations which i could ignore, but as the game kept on going, the frustrating things became more and more noticable and made me not want to play the game. Handling is really frustrating at times if you don't want to drift and even then, there are random snaps from time to time even when drifting. Also, fuck you if you dont want to drift because like 1/3 of the events are drift events. Also for some reason you get B tier races when you have S+ car. If i have a S+ car i want mostly S+ races, not the other way around. The story line starts very interesting imho but then it very fast turns into a grind fest and the whole story feels uncomplete and written by a 15 year old SJW ACAP white girl with blue hair.

One aspect that deserves special mention is the soundtrack. The carefully curated selection of music enhances the adrenaline-pumping atmosphere, creating a perfect synergy between gameplay and audio that elevates the overall enjoyment.

II finished the game now and have issues. This review is from SP experiences, MP coming later. Mostly will be compared to Heat & Payback.
[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[h3]Graphics[/h3]
+ Not too different with Heat in car models or atmosphere. But now we have unique takes on the human characters that using computerized animations with low details that pretty fresh take on the human characters which is not the most important of this game lol. But customization of our MC and style of enemies is pretty cyberpunk-ish and ""anime"". I dig it.
+ The stylized effects like smokes, hand-drawn sketch effects on nitrous, speeding, nos, crash, etc. is pretty cool. 1st I'm actually afraid the smoke will ruin my views when playing the game in 3rd person. But it isnt. Also this style embraces how NFS isnt real racing/car simulator like other games instead it embraces their arcadey, unrealistic feel but still with real cars.
+ Some effects like lightnings, rains, dirt, etc. is actually improved. If you really like photo mode and idle to view your cars while roaming you would love these details.
- The city design sadly pale. Still have the tarmac road, countryside and dirt but not as catch and colorful as Heat especially at night. But maybe its true to Chicago tho. A bit dull compared to Heat that set in Miami.
[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
+ The gameplay is similar since Payback. But some small changes and adjustment. You will feel familiar controls.
+ The drifting is better than Heat, return to classic that you can do drift combined with brake/handbrake instead of tapping the accelerations again. Well you can use both tho. Game even giving settings in customization how to execute drift and how we handle the car. Fully Grip/Drift/Neutral.
+ The livery and vanity is many. From some cars have the IRL racing livery and nostalgia livery from older NFS games. Also community made livery is pretty cool, showcasing capability how unique and nice the car livery is.
+ Performance customization is not as ""the next tier always better"" there is a way to customize your car that affect how it will handle different races. Make it grip/drift, good on road/dirt, or jack of all trades but master of none. I just wish we have more selections and can see what inside the hood for engines tho.
+ You need to return to safe house after races, if you get busted or totaled. You lose your night/day progress. Forcing you to free roam. Nice touch but sadly the city isn't pretty to roam around really.
- The racing tracks can be boring and repetitive. While I know its pretty realistic since we always come to same car meet area. The track design only revolve on same racetrack normal or reversed. Its fun and good for few hours but get boring later. Maybe to justify the restart mechanics?
- Its bcs we have limited restart of the race. Easy is 10, Normal is 4, Hard is 2. So dont waste your retry if you didnt win car or good money.
- These limited retry sadly get annoying bcs I feel a strong RNG each race. Its affect how skillful the enemy race, crash, cops, civilian AI cars, etc. sometimes it can help you win, but often it cost you entire race. Especially in B tier(the lowest) where we have generally slow unmodified cars. Its hard to win races continuously. But some thinks this is a good things tho. Emulates MP experience I think.
- The grind is real, you really struggle in early game to get money. Also you must buy in race to get into the race so your reward always get cut bcs of buying.
- Theres a new feature you can select one rival of the race more bets to gain extra money. But usually their racing skills and luck doubled also. They often defeat you easily or having car that seems more upgraded or not in same class as you.
- Your car have health, encourage you to drive not too aggressively. But bcs the RNG element of the race sometimes wrecking other cars and do some dirty races needed to win. Really its discouraging me to play MP since we all know either you find someone very skilled or chatic bastard that will ruin the race. Also maybe this is the closest EA rebooting burnout franchise lol.
[h3]Cops[/h3]
- RNG also affect cops. Here cops is able to screw you in race easily, they actively spawn here and there even out of nowhere. And its infuriating since they can spawn suddenly in the middle of road, crashed and get sideway almost blocking the road or jumping from strange places crashing your car or other racer car that you can easily crash especially in S/S+ race that mostly straight road race that you will drive really fast. Often costing me the race completely or screwed me on final part of the race.
- Also in early heat its too easy to evade in lower heat but its almost impossible to escape higher heat especially if you still stuck in B or A class cars that barely modified, once crash or stuck you can barely get out from boxed cop formations or other pedestrian cars blocking you.
- And bcs your car have health now, you cant mow those cops down like previous games. The damage retains also from race. So if you pretty much wrecked, say goodbye to your money bcs when you get busted, your progress that day, in daylight to night get wasted. And you repeat that day.
[h3]Story[/h3]
+ Story is progressed each end of the week. So you grind your way to face the story rival at the end. If you fail and have no retry you will sent back one day before. So dont mess up upgrades and lazy.
+ Zoomer style banters and storytelling. The story seems an afterthought nowadays. But the banters sometimes on point and call out every NFS ever like mentioning how a cops pursue racers like they do war crimes, also wrecking pedestrians, and wasting resources. Also the last part they calling out Fast & Furious franchise, constant remakes of older movies, Boomer vs Zoomers, etc. lmao. It's sometimes cracks me up.
- Storyline is same as heat, so similar in a way. But stakes a way lower. A bit strong start but underwhelming ending. This game has the lamest final race in entire franchise tbh.
- The cop radio is cringe AF, its like kids&teens playing cops. Also they call out if we does something illegals and crashed everywhere like we some damn maniac while they do it also. Also for ones who hate certain political views, you will hate this aspect since its apparent where EA politics lean on and its all over other franchise too outside NFS.
- The mayor storyline that we heard in entire radio randomly while roaming the world serve nothing to the story. Either which one is elected didn't contribute at all to the gameworld or etc. Why bother developing it so much and make it seems our character felt important to comment if our actions wont really matter in the end? Main story should revolve on this.
- Who the F is Alec? We never seen him from beginning to the end. Even if he showed once or twice I can't remember him at all and he never showed up even to the ending. Don't tell me this game tried to make it a sequels story since its really a weak prologue.
[h3]Audio[/h3]
- Soundtrack many hates this, too Zoomer, lofi, PG13 raps, etc. But for me its still ok and some is good. But my problem is same soundtrack played from menu, customization to races. Effectively making the soundtrack selection is the smallest compared to Heat/Payback. And most of the soundtrack isnt fitting to race at all. Compared to heat, payback and older NFS games, that s feel lazy.
- The car engine sounds similar to each other, not real car sounds I know but engine swaps sounds so similar. You can have few cars with same engine and it does sound the same. You can tune out your engine sounds but never really make much differences.
[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Its actually a better game compared to NFS Heat in term of core game play and customizations. But city design, cops, RNG in races, grind for money and wisely using the retry is sometimes infuriates me making me hard to really recommend the game. So did I have fun, well yeah for some parts, but also upsetting.",1704673684,1705575718,True,1,0,0.514018714427947998,0,True,False,False

When compared to that game, Unbound (at least now, I did not play this game when it initially launched over a year ago) feels like a more finished product overall, with more post launch support and more to do overall (Heat's early death was mainly due to EA shutting down the studio that made the game). However, in my experience, I've found this game to be quite enjoyable overall. The handling is fairly engaging, burst nitrous adds an extra interesting gameplay element, the car list is decent, the customization is extensive, the story isn't the worst thing in the world, and it has a more extensive online than Heat did. However, I do have my fair share of criticisms for this game, including the Online being separate from career mode for whatever reason, afterthought drift events, the career economy feeling too grindy in the beginning and too generous near the end, the map feeling more dreary and dead than Heat's, undercover cops just being really annoying, the handling occasionally having its quirks, and more stuff I can't think of right now. In spite of all that, I think that this is a fun game overall. I'm not sure if I would recommend buying this at full price, especially if you already own Heat, but it's a much better value on sale.",1705536654,1705536654,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sometimes it's not even clear whether that's a tarmac or an offroad race. This is a must for a more competitive play. More often than not, races are won by having the better car.

1846380,131981525,76561198259419689,0,30,4570,5,436,1708854782,"A stunning and unexpected modern addition to the NFS franchise. It could use some more customization for both characters and cars. Some of the races are a little lackluster and could use improvement. I liked the prologue, even though the voice acting is a bit off. It reminds me more of the NFS payback story, when everything was taken from the main character and have to build everything back up to get revenge.
In that aspect I think this game is better than Heat, but I don't completely agree with the execution and honestly think some of the game implementations could have taken a hike. 

Like regular races entry fee, I wouldn't mind losing money by placing a bad position in the race but there's no reason for it to have an entry fee, its just preventing you from racing altogether if you don't have the money, and that means no progress. This means theres an overwhelming amount of pressure on you to not lose or it's going to slow down your playthrough drastically and resulting in more grind, which isn't exactly fun.

In this game, money is everything. You would think that applies to other NFS games too, but in this game it's a completely different story. If you're not careful with your money you could easily fall into a pit that's hard to get out of, that being able to not win races due to your car being under-leveled, resulting in losing money to the point you can't enter races (as all races have entry fees, with a little exception. There will always be one race that's free to enter but the reward is laughable.)

Another thing are the cops, god forbid, these stupid, cops... Don't get me wrong, cops from Heat 1-3 are extremely easy no matter what tier of car you're in, it's the latter tiers that are the biggest problem. The cops themselves aren't even that difficult, they are just plain annoying and always camping you or blocking off events when your heat is high, especially at night.

It's just an endless cycle of: finishing a race, escape cops, finishing another race, escape cops again, trying to reach a race but cops engage in a pursuit, you finally escape and try to reach the race again but they're camping the area, you try to reach it anyway and they spot you, back to escaping cops. It's just, so, annoying, not to mention time consuming.

I see people complain a lot about the music, while I find a good 1/3rd of the soundtrack songs pretty cool. There are however some songs that are super annoying and always have to skip them because they're just so blatantly bad lmao.
So what I did was search the soundtrack on spotify and only pick out the good ones and put in a playlist, and this game suddenly became so much better. Though personally, rap isn't something I would die for in a racing game. For me, rock, trance, electronic and hi-nrg is where its at.

Personally I avoid Drift and Take over events since they aren't races,  and its much harder for me because of the new handling. I would like to do drift events but I really do not like the way its set up, the NFS game that pulled off drift events the best is by far Payback.

Another big thing is that you can no longer enter races with a car much faster than the rest of the competition. Meaning races will be much more difficult and even. So all competitors will have the same Tier (B / A / A+ / S / S+). 
Meaning you are pretty much forced to accquire at least 2-3 cars in different tiers to take advantage of the different tier races available on the map each day. Because if you only have 1 car and have to go back to the garage to downgrade it in order to join an event then you're skipping the day which is really annoying.

Having a high-end tier car is the safest bet to win, because that means you're at the top of the tier and you will be predicted to finish in a higher position than the other competitors, which will obviously make races a lot easier.
There are however advantages to low-end cars, meaning they're at the bottom of their tier. The lower your prediction position is, the more betting money you can gain by under-dogging the competition. The game shows you it's highly unlikely for you to finish first in a low-end car, which means you can make even more bank by betting on the highest predicted racer.

Doing delivery jobs is a must, especially during day time as it doesn't provide heat level, and is overall a good source of money and even unlocks a new car.

About the car handling and tuning. Personally I keep it in the middle, neutral. You can still grip or drift depending on the situation and improvise. If you go for a full Drift or Grip build it's far too committing and compromises other factors, you can probably only get away with this on certain races. (Drift for tracks with many and sharp corners, Grip for high speed and milder corners).

For B and A tier cars I highly suggest an AWD car since their accel and traction is much higher, they also allow you to slide corners even at grip setting without compromising control.
However if you're thinking about an AWD car for A+ S or S+ I would suggest otherwise.
AWD cars are insanely broken in this game, thats why their one downside is high speed control, they have a tendency of oversteering at high speeds (255kmh or 160mph and faster).
So much to the point it's hard to keep them in a straight line, it doesn't even matter if you have grip, neutral or drift build. If you still wish to do it you will soon realize your mistake once you do high-way races, because thats the one place these AWD cars will cry.

Update: Managing the incessant amount of cops was easier with S and S+ tiered cars (makes sense), but it was still incredibly annoying to get the money for them. This really took away from the game. The cops overall were not difficult, but the sheer amount of cop chases in between races and those following the end of races were bothersome. 

I did seek out to complete the main story because I am biased towards NFS and really do like their games. In my opinion, this is probably the worst NFS I've played. However, I did manage to finish the story while being annoyed more than half of the time. So take that information as you will. (Obviously if you're considering buying the game, get it on sale). I did read that cops on the online side are not as annoying so I might give that a go.

We all know, Need for Speed was seriously starting to look goddamn dead and buried!
But, Surprise.. here comes the 'Rescue Party'!
The combination of beautiful, realistic-looking graphics and Driving effects borrowed straight from an Anime Movie works surprisingly well in my opinion. Aside from that, you'll find many awesome Cars, Tuning Options and a really beautiful Open World you can explore.
The Story of NFS Unbound doesn’t get in your way and the Driving Model in this Title hits nearly the right spot > except the Drift Model. The Drift Model in this NFS was awful > my opinion.

ALL IN ALL. This is how you make a good Arcade Racing Game.

 - Just two attempts for the race? Really? And money lost?
 - You've finished the race the Nth (1,2,3) place, restarted it and midrace decided to finish it - now you LOSE the race completely. Your previous standing is lost.
 - I'm greeted with ""Not enough money"" for races from the get go. How to replenish you wallet? Drive like a madman on the streets of the city collecting scraps. No scraps left? Destroy rare cop cars. This is the first such a game in the series. You have to grind just to be able to race. WTF? Someone wanted the game to become a freaking chore?
 - There was a sense of progression in earlier games. Now your first car has a maximum speed of 200km/h and takes 12 seconds to reach 100. Really? Will I be driving at 350km/h later on?
- Side missions suddenly disappeared.
- You've got busted? Your current day is finished. Everything's lost.

Damn, someone wanted players to grind for hundreds of hours to finish the game.",1705329948,1705332979,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story was bit boring. Didn't feel to come play so I played heat instead. 
Still I completed the story then quit it.
But playing online mode in heat was bit boring as there was no class type cars and everyone having best cars was bit boring to see in every race.
Because of this I started playing unbound and my man it was great as we constantly looking for the best builds in different class and numerous races in which we can play and constantly learning about the car drivability.

I'd like to talk about nfs unbound and share my opinion about it
first off Only buy this game When there is a sale
had an okay experience with this game 
good cars selection
Widebody Crown Victoria which is dope and rare
A$AP Rocky in the game easy to beat him in the races 
and says some inspiring shit like he is like us and he has problems like we have and whatnot.
customization is like it's on another level, crazy shit you can do on this game, you can remove the front and back bumper on some of the cars,
and there are legendary customs that change the car completely like it came from cyberpunk or made in the render thing. you don't have that on other games According to my knowledge.
and anime characters and smoke stuff are cool as well.
the story is decent.

now for the bad stuff that makes me delete the game from my PC and only play the story,
cops are everywhere.
Races are hell on the relaxed difficulty like I'm not playing online yo wtf?
the cash you take from races is low.
car handling... sighs... is very complicated people say it is bad from the start of the game but you can change it later down the line and it will be perfect. that's bull shit 
i WANT to like the game but I can't it doesn't let me

The story was far better than I was expecting and has good twists in it. The police being a problem during the day wasn't something I thought I wanted but I do and it really makes you think about what to do first before your wanted level becomes a problem. Takeovers are awesome and customization isn't shorted and flows just like Heats does. I also like how performance upgrades are unlocked through shop upgrades (fits the story well). The AI is probably the best and most challenging with minimal to no rubber banding. AI cars seem very consistent throughout the game and there will be cars that are just better than yours but learning how to corner faster than them made the whole experience frustrating but in a good way.

First, the story is just non-existent, you go from meeting to meeting hoping to win something to be able to upgrade your car but the progression is the slowest I ever seen in a NFS game and i started with the first NFS Underground and played all of them since this one.
One thing I particularly HATE is that there is no ""fast travel"" option, you have to drive everywhere, which turn to a nightmare experience when you have a high heat car, it's close to impossible to reach the meet-up without being busted. And if this happens when you have already barely any cash cause you just upgraded your car, it slows down your progression tremendously!
Add to this all the childish/cartoonish animation that add absolutely nothing to the game play and you have one of the worst NFS game ever!
If you want to play one of the latest NFS game, I would stick to payback, at least there's a story and a proper progression when this game is a succession of meaningless events with a very sluggish progression!

The police can be a bit much especially with the heat multiplier does nothing to your overall rewards. But, police chases were always a core part of the NFS franchise and for me the cops on this game are a bit more bearable than the cops on Most Wanted 2005 AKA the GOAT itself where I'd constantly feel terrorized upon leaving the safe house. Handling on this game is a hundred times better than the previous PS4 trio titles where drifting would cause a headache, this game's car is far more controllable. The driving effects and the burst nitrous system in my opinion are genuinely a ton of fun and activating the level 3 burst always feels so god dang satisfying.

Not in the sense, that the games are all that similar, when compared directly, but it got things I have not seen in a while.

This game got me sweating to earn enough money to upgrade my car, tune it and then win the race. Once I barely got on second place, I got to evade the cops without trashing my car, slipping into my garage only seconds before one of those damn helicopters is catching me, saving my money that I earned that night. Then the grind begins again and another day of races, drift and takedown events start again.

It's not like no game has done this before, but the balance was just perfect for me. Just a tiny sprinkle of story, filled with a lot of partially cringey, yet still heartful dialogue and a fully voiced protagonist and motion capatured cutscenes (only a few). All that with some quite interesting stylistic choices, that may split the audience and supporters and haters.

So why does it remind me of those old Need for Speed games? Winning races feels tense, close, sweaty and every driver is sort of aggressive, races feel fast, the difference between a perfect corner drift and sliding into traffic, killing everything good about that race is just a tiny slip away. And that brings me back to Most Wanted and Carbon. The police chases are less well balanced. It is harder to escape, but it is barely impossible to be caught by them, so you stay in a limbo of barely not escaping, but never in a real threat, unless you wreck your car entirely. But in the end, it was still really entertaining.

I think this should be the deciding factor wether you should buy this game or not:

At it's core, the driving physics are the same since Need For Speed Hot Pursuit (2010). If you have played that game or any NFS, that was released after 2010, you already experienced the handling. If you did NOT enjoy those driving physics, you are not going to enjoy this game either.
So clearly no buy recommendation!

That being said, I'll explain in more detail what I like and dislike about the driving physics, in case you are new to the franchise have not yet experienced the 'newer' NFS driving physics since 2010.



BREAK-TO-DRIFT:

First of all the core gameplay can be described as 'break-to-drift'. So in order to get your car to slide, you tap the break and the car transitions from grip to drift. This feels just as weird as it sounds. It can still be a very fun gameplay mechanic, since the game rewards you for doing it properly and it's really satisfying to drift through corners at high speed. 
Depending on your car setup, there are also multiple ways of getting your car to slide. Either with a gas tap instead of a break tap or by exceeding a certain steering angle at a high enough speed. This gives you more options to change the cars behaviour to your preferences.

However, the transition from grip to drift always feels 'forced'. The game basically decides at which points the applied physics change from grip to drift, which in 90% of all setups isn't smooth at all! Regarding the control you have over the car, it seems like a switch was flicked and now it handles different than before, which is really disruptive.

This is especially true, when transitioning back or recovering from a slide. Just without a button press to initiate the transiotion (like tapping the breaks).

The result of this break-to-drift mechanic is the loss of precise control over your car. So the car in general feels very unresponsive. It is incredibly difficult to weave through traffic or adjust your line through corners, since the handling physics can change at any time from grip to drift. Too often you loose complete control over your car, because the game changed the driving physics on you. This is the inherent flaw with this (or any) break-to-drift engine.




GRIP BUILDS:

A new feature is to build setups, that do not use the slide mechanic of the game. Which is great. There is a new way of playing the game, and further possibility to modify the handling to your liking.

However, these grip-builds can't be applied to every car, since the basic non upgraded car needs to lean towards grip regarding the handling already.

Also the above described break-to-drift mechanic still is there and is quite notable. You can usually pin-point the moment where the game would switch from grip to drift, but then doesn't, because of the setup. 
In essence these builds are more controllable but still feel somewhat unresponsive. I crashed with really good grip builds as much as I've crashed with really bad drift-builds. You may call this a skill issue, but I don't have the time and motivation to put in hours and hours of practice just to play an arcade racer just for fun.

It also makes the game less fun, since you can get the impression, that the car just drives on rails, which gets boring really quickly.



TUNING SETUPS:

Trying out different upgrades, like changing from a turbo to a supercharger or changing from drift to grip tires can be a lot of fun, but more often than not, it's just annoying. There is no good way to test your applied changes due to the progression system of the game. Once you leave the garage you can only return to it without progressing the story if you completed NO event that day (or night). So you can drive your car with a new setup, but if you don't want to accidentally progress your story, be sure to play no event, not start a cop chase, complete no activity (like a speedtrap) and don't even get any collectible.
This is very limiting and annoying to find a good setup for your car.

I found the best way to approch this, is just to look up good car setups and use those builds. There are really incredible builds out there, I highly recommend using those. Otherwise you'll waste time effort and money to find a build that you're happy with, since it is no easy task to find a good car setup, especially for casual players!



MANUAL GEARBOX:

This is a very nice option to get more control over your car, but the way it's implemented is so awful. I do not understand how it can feel so alienating to use a manual gearbox. For casual players definetly not recommended.
Currently there is also no option for button mapping for controlers. So better get used to shifting with the shoulderpads!


CONCLUSION:
Break-to-drift mechanic is an absolute dealbreaker. The car feels unresponsive to uncontrollable. This can only partially be fixed or compensated. Not recommended for casual players and not recommended for competetive players (there are games with better physics to train your racing game skills).

If you want better progression, I would suggest Heat or Forza (though Heat can suffer from the same issue of repetitiveness because certain races give more rewards than others, so if you are going for meta you end up playing the same races over and over).

Invest an f ton of money firsthand in ""upgrading the garage"" to have access to higher tier, but those are to be paid too... you want to strap an elite tier part? First upgrade the garage with 100k to be able to put the 40k turbo on.... 
You have to have multiple cars cuz the events are broken down in different car categories.... you cant just have one car to upgrade it to max, you have to have multiple downgraded ones for each tier... 
The heat does not stick to the car used but to the player, so no matter if you run dirtbag car after a dirtbag event that forces you to swap car, if you go heat 4 after the event you stick with the dirbag car and that is absolutely terrible....after each race you get cop chase..... money for escaping the said cop chases is dirt....

NFS Unbound is a pretty OK game in my opinion, and here's why:

PROS:
-Art style: Innovative, leaning towards an anime-style which is pretty neat
-NFS Feel: Feels more like a NFS game than the recent releases. 
-Price: Frequently on sale

CONS:
-Replayability: This game gets stale instantly after story mode is beaten
-Soundtrack: Atrocious soundtrack except for like 2 songs
-Difficulty: The game is ridiculously easy to beat, even on the hardest difficulty. The cops are a joke when you're running the extra damage mod on your cars.

Pros: nice engine sounds
Cons: Game itself is slow as hell, super arcade (and I thought Wreckfest was arcade..), you cannot pit opponents, you cannot wreck them. I mean you can, but the appear instantly. You just go fast and evade few cars.
 Getting to race takes most of the tame, racing itself is like 20% of my time in the game (if you dont want to be permachased by cops, you must sneak through forrests, I couldn´t find the way to fast travel to race). Races are super easy, only difficulty you can pick is by choosing car - go crown victoria for super hard difficulty. And game has some visual tuning of car, but no rust, no frames, just glossy pains and ricer wheels.
 And also problem with last few games - you are quite forced to pick ultra/hyper cars to be competitive, so basically game has like 5 cars.

The game suffers from stability issues, with frequent crashes and unexpected glitches disrupting the gameplay. This lack of stability seriously hampers the overall enjoyment and immersion in the game.

The graphics in Need for Speed Unbound are far from impressive. The visuals appear choppy and lack the refinement seen in other contemporary racing games. The game fails to utilize the potential of modern gaming hardware, resulting in a lackluster visual experience.

Unbound brings nothing new to the table in terms of gameplay or concept. It feels like a recycled version of previous Need for Speed titles, lacking innovation and failing to captivate players with a fresh and exciting experience. The repetition of the same old formula makes the game boring and predictable.

To start of with you need to us EA software to run this game and that is a nightmare. It causes so many graphical issues and problems with the game and it feels like i spent more time researching how to get the game to START and function properly then actually playing the game.

The other main issue I have it this game is constantly trying to get you to hate it. I like the look of the game, the story is enough, and the customize is on par with most need for speed games. The issue is the AI in this game is outrageously bad, you might be able to look past it but the game will literally screw you out of content like a cool new car because the AI hits a tree and crashes into you and you only get so many retries before your just screwed, and the only way to re attempt getting the fun new car to play around with is either buying it or restarting your entire game. Then to top it off the cops in this game are way to aggressive, it does feel satisifying the 1st or 2nd time escaping them but get used to it because almost every race i went into resulted in an insane police chase where you have to escape them and dont worry there is almost always a perfectly placed van or other car placed right at the perfect spot right before you escape to make it take even longer or even cause you to fail.

The last issue i have is that the game has a tendency to be jank AF in so many incidents with way too many unbreakable objects. For instance you race down a highway for fast and for no apparent reason the road is uneven and it sends you spiraling out of control and you lose the race. Or you are running from the cops or in a race and you have the tiniest graze to a vehicle or railing or other misc thing and your car gets ""totaled"" and you lose again. This would all be ok if you could keep retrying but since your limited on retries the game literally punishes for its janky carppy design.

I really wanted to like this one. I have been satisfied  with the previous few titles but this one misses the mark so far.",1705074635,1705074635,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Late game grip builds are the most viable builds but at the same time are WILDLY inconsistent. The same corner at similar speeds with similar braking will randomly lead to understeer or oversteer, and if you think you can just increase the downforce to compensate then you'll find yourself fishtailing randomly at high speeds when taking back to back mild turns. 

Cops aren't fun to run from which is surprising because it was excellent in Heat, and I think it's to do with the tuning of the AI. The AI in this is a lot stupider but spots you quicker and can keep up with you a lot easier. Then theres the level 3 heat cop, the interceptor, which is simply painful to deal with. You're meant to take them offroad to lose them but for the middle part of the game they travel the same speed as you offroad, so really you have to try and force them to crash into oncoming traffic, but because you can't catch them it's really a waiting game with a luck element.

The graphical art style is beautiful. I've always been a big fan of the pixel-shading and cel-shading art styles, ever since The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. The game does a very good job of having the perfect amount of realism in the environment and automobiles, while adding some graphical flair in other elements, such as effects, characters and interactions with the environment.

The play style, steering and tuning mechanics are all excellent, if not a bit convoluted. I think the system for upgrading cars could be more succinct and require less navigation in various menus. That said, you do have a lot of options and this game brings me the joy I hoped for in earning and upgrading cars that I could never afford in real life.

My primary gripes are as follows: The prevalence of, and lack of options in dealing with the the in-game time mechanism and the cops... The cop factor becomes a burdensome annoyance at times. You'll spend as much time messing with the cops as you will any other singular thing in the game. I wish there were more ways to avoid the cops and/or lower your heat level. I also wish you could return to the garage at anytime, bank your cash and return to the open world to earn more money without triggering the day-night cycle. It would be better if there were an innate in-game time, like many RPGs, with the option to trigger the day-night transition if you were ready to do so. Lastly, fast travel would have been an invaluable option in the Story Mode. It's present in the online play, but not the Story Mode.

The horrible physics they've been stuck on for the last few (numerous) entries. Bring back the feel of Carbon, Most Wanted (2005), heck even Underground 2, etc. This weighted car thing or whatever it is just isn't it. It does not feel natural in the slightest and seriously kills the vibe of the game. The story so far seems interesting and I am loving the customization options (50 state license plates with registration tags and such in the correct places is a nice extra touch) and the art style additions to lights, tire smoke, and drifting are neat in their own right (however I recommend fine tuning some of the graphic options to your liking) the realism of the textures and renderings of the cars themselves however is not the best nor do I think it even qualifies to be called current gen especially compared to other arcade racing games such as Forza Horizon 5 or or even CarX. More on the level of 2004- 2007 graphics if I'm honest. The difficulty of the police is fantastic on all 5 levels of heat with a nice addition being different tactics are necessary to defeat each type of pursuit vehicle although there is something lacking in the execution that I can't quite put my finger on. I know it stems from there only being one type of vehicle assigned to each heat level but at the same time it adds a layer of thought to how far you want to take things in each day and night cycle so I'm not quite sure but something definitely feels off. Car selection, while limited, is decent enough and I'm sure they will expand on it in the future.

 Final thoughts. I will not be purchasing this entry. While the ten hour trial was interesting, my friends and I all agree, the physics of the game ruin it. Maybe the next entry or when the game is deeply discounted or a full version on EA Play, it will be worth picking up. 

Pros:
-Customization
-Soundtrack
-Map and open world in general
-Neat graphic additions to lights and tire smoke help define it as a casual arcade entry along with the cartoonish drivers
-Event variety
-Story
-Day and Night cycle is interesting

Cons:
-Physics are horrid, cars feel like there's a 1 ton ball rolling around inside of them or something (if you've tried the last few entries, it's more of the same if not worse)
- Graphical fidelity of vehicle rendering reminds me of much older games or a basic remaster of such
-Limited police interaction of different types. A bit too many on 4 and 5 star Heat levels slows down progress massively in being able to access events or get back to the garage
-Vehicle selection is pretty limited but I'm sure they'll add more and what is available is decent enough",1704890931,1704890931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whether it's the embarrassingly abysmal writing and voice acting, the downright dreadful vehicle handling and police chases, or the confounding inability to choose a gender while the game insists on spotlighting the nationality of every other racer, it feels like a deliberate effort to exclude any Caucasian representation (except for the peculiar German character with the fake accent and the dude who mirrors a substance-addicted mumble rapper chanting about SKUUURT SKUURTing). I can't decipher if it's attempting to be woke or racist; a game devoid of white characters, where everyone is immersed in criminal activities, is a mockery in itself. Each second, every phrase, every cutscene intensifies the desire to surgically remove my eardrums and eyeballs. This game is downright horrific.

Now, onto this game. The storyline, it's okay, nothing surprising in it, just a good story for a racing game. Don't really like the cartoonish vibe, it's off for me. Lacks the gritty, more serious apparel, which would be more fitting for every NFS game. 

The driving. Man, it feels like a 5-year-old could do it better. It's clunky, it's unexpected. The higher in the tiers you go, the more battling with the car and so on. The terrain is bumpy for some reason, even on the straight roads, your car sometimes jumps all over the road. The Heat had a lot better driving experience, than this, whatever this is. The only good thing about driving is the drifting model. It's smoother, actually nice to drift around the corners.  

Customizations are on point, nothing to add here.

Completing events during a day earns you heat, which then makes cop chases more likely and frequent while you are out in the open world. Essentially the game gives you a choice to balance between earning a lot of money during a day (by completing a lot of events) but risking it to the cops, or earning less but being safer.

That is a good system in theory, but it is very easy to get to heat 3 or above, which makes cop chases an absolute pain. They happen constantly, you will have a very hard time avoiding being seen by the police, it takes several minutes to outdrive them - and the moment you are out and can finally head to the event you were targeting, you likely get into another one on the way there. It is a very annoying system that is almost forced on you since you NEED that cash especially early in the game to buy more cars and upgrades.

Other than that bad system, the game itself is okay. It controls well (though the cars generally feel a bit slippery) and it looks nice. The story is a mess, with twists a 5 year old could see coming and some VERY annoying characters (Tess and Yaz specifically). The characters also talk constantly even while driving around. Some of the dialogue is admittedly pretty funny, but most of it doesn't hit the mark. There are also collectibles littered on the map as well as small events (like hot laps or drift challenges), but those have a fundamental flaw: you will not be able to complete those with all stars until you have a very good car, which means you will leave most of those until you are the very end of the game.

Overall, while I do like the style and general feel of the game, I could eventually not stomach the constant cop chases, irritating dialogue and boring gameplay loop with the ever same events anymore. If the game was only half as long, it may be better, but after 16 hours I was not even at the halfway mark.

Копы в гонках стопают только тебя, на остальных они не реагирую практически вовсе. Даже при равной прокачке соперники обгоняют на прямой без шансов.

The events are the same courses over and over. Most events are contained to the bottom right of the map which are tied to the safe house areas. The police chases get really old and the cops will patrol safe house areas that ensures persistent, annoying chases. 

There is no motivation to get the collectibles, as they don't amount to any significant in-game currency to do anything. Smash signs, find bears (wat), and bad clipart graffiti to still not have enough money to enter even the lowest of events.

Though you're best off picking this up on a discount.

I like the high risk high reward system the game revolves around, though early on, cops are really intimidating, because there's no heat limit like in Most Wanted, so you could get 5 heat on a tier B or A car, which would be extremely hard. But I like how this does mean you have to be strategic about playing. Cop chases are fun though they can be relentless.

Some people dislike this aspect because it means you won't have as much cash available as other games, but the whole premise of the game is that you built ONE car over the course of a week, of which there are 4. So yeah, you won't be building 10 cars, obviously. I found it to be pretty manageable imho. Take more risks, get more money, do daily challenges, skill challenges and the occasional delivery/chase event and you should have plenty of cash. 

At the beginning of week 3 I was able to buy a Huracan Performante, which was pretty much at the top of the week's required S tier already and 5 Heat wasn't bad anymore at that point. At the beginning of week 4 I could buy a GT2 RS - same deal, reached the top of required S+ tier really quickly. Before the last race, I had 1.5 mil to spare to be able to get a LaFerrari, too. So, the money is there, you just have to actually look for it. Not to mention you do get plenty of chances to get prize cars, which aren't a bad platform to upgrade or just sell for cash.

Some things I did dislike:

-The tracks repeat a lot, enough for it to be noticeable.

-Some events work better with certain car setups, like takeover events work best with offroad drift cars but you may not be able to manage many different cars of all tiers due to money shortage

-Can't rebind controller controls in the game, need to do it via Steam

-Playing manual gearbox is annoying because scene transitions, like resuming chases after finish a race, will put you in 1st gear, even though you might be at a speed that requires 3rd or 4th.",1704039077,1704553276,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For the people that are here just checking if it is worth or not tl;dr: the city is lively, the customization system and driving is... nice, the story is weak but this is a given for racing games, the animated characters and effects are definitely nice and an interesting take.

For the people that want to hear me out, let's begin:
I will start with the good and end with the bad
The good parts are:
-a new NoS system, Power NoS, you can get it by drafting, near missing traffic, grip and drift turning, hitting and taking out police, and some other stuff I may have forgot. It doesn't even make you go that faster but it SURELY FEELS LIKE IT;
-grip driving is very much back but it's not usable on EVERY. SINGLE. CAR., some cars just don't respond do it so better experiment;
-driving customization is separate for every car so no 2 different cars drive the same(unless you tweak them so they feel the same);
-character customization is very good (I am not brave enough to say inclusive because I don't know how much inclusivity you can get with the animated artstyle but it's definitely good), the characters you can create fill that crazy, animated look of the 00's with a little modern twist, colors everywhere but the clothes, shoes are modern, you can give your character unlockable funny poses to do every time you win a bet, and there is more to it I don't remember everything off the top of my head;
-the modes are definitely fun, the takeovers seem like you are about to be televised for the whole country to see, drifting (when it wants to works, i'll get into that later) is fun seeing all the effects and animated smoke cascade into each other, speed races really feel like you're going so fast you are about to rip the time-space continuum and corner races are just what is written on the can, a race with a lot of corners, head to head is really challenging it feels like they just flip the AI to go from 1 to 100 really fast, and i just love endurance(mostly cause it doesn't spawn cops after, but still it's a good refresh after a good amount of heat 5 chases);
-the city is set in Chicago so be prepared to see a lot of urban art, which you can also collect and use as decals for your car;
-the character feel lively, for the first time, probably ever, the npc's have faces, you can attribute feeling to those faces and hate those characters, love them, or anything in between for that matter. they will bump you and talk smack after, they will pass you and say a cocky line, when they are behind you they will discourage you, they feel like real street racers and for me it never got old, no matter how many times i heard ""hey i think i saw someone in the back of your car, maybe you should stop and check"", or ""are you hitting me just cause you know you can't beat me?"";
-the animated artstyle(while it is very much controversial) i just eat it up, i love me some good animated characters, they kinda have the same vibe as Arcane, which is just SO GOOD. do not get me started on how good the effects feel, when Power Boost charges you see this static around the car, just charging up, when you unleash a full Power Boost bar you get these wings that really make you feel like you're flying(you also get them for getting air times and sometimes the effects differ);
-the story, while weak, it is very much heartwarming. if you want to see another set of ""family above all else"" fast and furious type of energy give this a try;
-ASAP Rocky is in the game, so like idk maybe this will tickle someone's fantasy. he literally presents you the first takeover event;
-the soundtrack is so good, from ASAP to Charli XCX, to Playboi Carti, to even some K-Pop and K-Rap, it really gives that illegal street racing vibe I was looking for(I'm actually listening to the soundtrack as I'm writing this), I do not really know how to describe it, but the vibes are immaculate;

And now let's get to the bad parts... Oh boy:
-Like i was saying the story is weak, It has a good beginning and a very wholesome, heartwarming end, but that's it, it's got no substance and sometimes it feels unnatural.(I had a summary here but I reached the character limit) I hope you understand that i love the cheesy energy of the story but it still doesn't take from the fact that it is forced, you cussing out Tess for wanting to fix a race but after 2 hours you guys are buddy-buddy again when she tells you to deliver a car that has heat on it, or how fast you make up with Yaz, I hate to say that i hate the story cause I love the characters, their chemistry is just forced;
-as i said before ASAP Rocky is in the game but he literally has 3 WHOLE LINES?????? THERE ARE MORE THAN 3 TAKEOVER EVENTS I CAN TELL YOU THAT MUCH. also there is a moment where you get to drive his car and he talks to your character but it again feels forced, it feels like Criterion couldn't really afford much of him, like he goes from calming you down after you fangirl over him to him telling you about his passions and projects, which literally feels like an interview or an over-the-phone interview of ASAP Rocky that they tried to put in the game without much thought;
-PLEASE. DO. NOT. GET. ME. STARTED. ON. THE. KEYBOARD. CONTROLS. If you want to play this game, play it with a controller please save yourself the anger and get a controller for this game, there are moments when im going 240km/h and my character refuses to steer. I still have no idea why this happens but it angered me the first 5 hours of the game. If you know a fix to this please tell me cause I tried everything and nothing worked, I even tried fixing the hardware, didn't work, i literally set the game to relaxed(the easiest difficulty) cause i knew that i can't really play if i can't steer and i wanted to be able to play the game and compete with he AI;
-also please don't buy any dlc's if you don't exactly know what you are getting, its usally just cars that you need to grind for anyway;
-from the previous point, the game is grindy but not like warframe-grindy where the grind is less and less there the more you play, its there the whole time and sometimes it feels annoying especially in the story with the time-gated content, it's linear and that's what I don't like;
-while the cops are now rammable and are able to be taken out and they offer interesting challenge, sometimes they either feel unfair and relentless and sometimes they feel like they aren't really a challenge;
-there are walls and rocks that feel like they are put there just to bust your ass when you need to go offroad in a chase or to escape being spotted, that's not really a problem but they look exactly like breakable walls;
-the crash system is so rage inducing and yet not really punishing. when you crash into a wall it feels like it's a 50/50 chance for your car to just walk it off or to just fly off the road doing 17 pirouettes while doing so, but also when you crash you spawn a little bit further ahead from the crash site and also you have remarkable speed on respawn, so then why does it need to give me a cutscene where i can't do anything mid-race instead of just taking a bit of my speed and letting me walk it off?

There's a lot of questions i have for this game, and little to no answers to those questions. But while that is I am brave to recommend this game, if it is on sale that is, I really don't feel like it's worth full price judging by how much angry it made me. I myself got this game on Winter Sale for 10 euros and if you also got this offer for yourself or a friend i really recommend it.
And with that my review ends I hope you enjoyed and i helped someone and that someone can help me with my issues of controls, but anyway, I hope if you are reading this you have a great rest of your day and don't forget to drink water.",1704549661,1704549661,False,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

The game has a realistic and immersive graphics, sound, and physics engine that make you feel like you are driving a real car. The game also has a dynamic weather system that changes the conditions of the road and the atmosphere of the game.

I like the vibe when playing the game because I live in a rainy state so as the game. The rain makes the game more challenging and exciting, as you have to deal with slippery roads, reduced visibility, and wet effects. The rain also adds to the mood and the aesthetics of the game, as you can see the reflections of the lights and the buildings on the wet surfaces. 

I find NFS Unbound more enjoyable than NFS Heat, even though NFS Heat is not a bad game and very enjoyable too. Some of the reasons why I prefer NFS Unbound over NFS Heat is NFS Unbound has a more linear and scripted story, which keeps me engaged and interested. NFS Heat has a more open and free-roaming world, which gives me more freedom and options, but also makes me lose focus and direction.

You can choose smooth street racing (highways) or tune your car for drifting and on spiral roads (you can pass the turns in different ways, such as drifting without handbrake or braking or drifting with handbrake, each of which has its own advantages) or compete in special drift races or takeover races. You can control your heat. You can choose a race with a high prize and a high heat and end your day with a race or use cheaper races with less heat. If you are not a professional and can't run away from the cops, try setting your heat during the day so that you start with heat 2 or 3 when night falls. But escaping from the police in this game is not very difficult and only requires a little intelligence and practice (in fact, if you turn off your car, the range of vision of the police will decrease and it will be harder for them to see you and even when the car is turned off the helicopter will not be able to see you).

Almost 7 hours in and i will have to be honest... after having recently replayed Payback and Heat... this game falls seriously short on all aspects except the car visual customisation and story which frankly isn't enough ""wow"" to save it.

Racing - 1 / 10
1. Bumpy and Twitchy, your wheels are rarely on the ground, cornering is a menagerie of wanting to drift while powersliding while gripping all at once, occasionally the car just veers to a random direction, imitating sidewalk collision i think.

2. Cops are easy, more acting like flies hovering over a freshly squeezed turd than being aggressive.

3. AI racers once they gain more than say 100m away from you, there is no hope of winning, Drafting only works within 30m but feels the need to tell you that you are indeed Drafting while the car infront of you is pulling away from you effortlessly, i don't expect a simulator, i know NFS has always been more an arcade style game, but its never been this bad.

Basically someone decided to try and import realism into Mario-Kart with none of the fun shenanigans.

World - 8.5 / 10
Alive, actual pedestrians bring a welcoming world that seems teaming with life adding to the immersion of the whole experience, tons of shortcuts and jumps everywhere, makes it super fun, and unlike Heat it actually doesnt rain ALL the damn time.

Car Selection - 5 / 10
Reintroduction of some classic NFS:Underground 2 cars like the Eclipse, and then there is the Delorean, some older make of a Mercedes its nice to see that its not the usual selection of the cars we actually WANT to see and then a tonnage of BMW's, Lambo's and Ferarri's, still no Toyota though.

Story - 8 / 10
Always rate NFS storylines high since i believe they could legit replace any F&F movie passed the 6th instalment, this one is just as immersive, no spoilers, but its got light comedy with some //okay// acting integrated from the voice actors, atleast its not a bald guy mumbling Familia! as his car rockets into a backflip after wall riding a crater of the moon, still a better love story than Twilight.

Finally.
Its with regret iam uninstalling this instalment, since everything is fine and hunky dory but the racing aspect of the game, being the main aspect is near unplayable... id rather emulate Ridge Racer 1994 or NFS: High Stakes for PS1 before trying again, it seems they left all the budget for the basic mechanics of the game to adding A$AP Rocky into a benign role, was hoping to see more of him tbh, here is hoping EA and NFS respectively learn from this mess and look at more than the positive reviews from paid SM Influencers, saving grace was that i hadn't paid full price for this.

Pros:
+ amazing soundtrack
+ good graphics
+ fun to play, fun to escape cops
+ great car customization (still missing body sculpting from NFS Carbon)
+ good drifting physics (Forza has much better of course, but Unbound is still better than last few NFS titles)
+ branded cars and clothing

Cons:
- game is not optimized - stutters and huge FPS drops even with high end PC
- weak story line in career mode
- engine and car sounds are muted - very quiet and much worse that in NFS Heat
- cartoon characters and driving effects breaks the immersion
- exhaust tuning does not make a big difference (NFS Heat is the benchmark, it had amazing exhaust tuning and car sounds)",1704502893,1704502893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That said the cops are ENTIRELY too aggressive at early levels and considering getting busted one too many times could keep you from being able to continue with the game, forcing you to start over, that's not great. Sure, if you've been playing these games with this mechanic for a long long time, this element will be easy for you. I've played a LOT of racing games and I consider myself quite good at them. After these races....this isn't a racing game anymore. It's a full on hyper-aggressive car chase on normal. Starting the game as you do with a B-tier car, they are almost impossible to get away from after 3 stars if you aren't already a pro. Until you start to get A+ cars you're going to find them difficult, every one, on normal. I've been playing on relaxed and let me tell you, it's anything but. The cop chases are still super (down from hyper) aggressive but at least I can get away from them every once in a while in my A+ car. 

I plan on finishing the game, but this mechanic of losing all your money for a day, combined with the week progressing relentlessly, combined with the heat rising after every race, combined with the super aggro cops is really just unfun for me.

The cars however and the story and the races and aesthetic are really what are keeping me here. I LOVE that I can basically just dump all my money into my favorite car (a car I owned and adored 20+ years ago but was rear-ended and totaled RIP) and enjoy it for what seems to be most of the game. I LOVE the soundtrack and aesthetic. 

Like I said, I'm enjoying it, but I simply can't believe their play testers didn't mention the aggressiveness of the cops. You probably should have listened to them.",1704493914,1704493914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If it hadn't crashed a dozen times on me in under 5 hours, I actually wouldn't be that hesitant to recommend it (provided you are willing to deal with the usual NFS cheesiness, because boy is that present).

A bizarre issue I also came across- the game will randomly get stuck in a fullscreen blue, green, or red filter (this only applies to the world render, oddly, not the car) and stay there for upwards of anywhere from 1-5 minutes. It will just eventually randomly fix itself, but in 30 years of PC gaming I can't recall a single game that's had an issue so specific and so bizarre that just 'fixes' itself. I'll also posit it's Frostbite. I pity every developer that has been forced to work with it at the great detriment of their development cycle for the past 12 years. EA really just ought to invest capital into making a successor to it at this point, if even possible- if not, please for the love of giving a damn about the integrity of your products, make a new engine. Maybe with Respawn's alumni now in charge they actually WILL. When I can see the same fundamental problem with literally everything intended to be a cutscene in NFS Rivals (2013), NFS Payback (2017) and this (Radeon 7900 XT, Intel i9 13900K, 32GB GDDR5, fans aren't even spooling up on either to run this at ultra)... It really makes me question whether they can ever fix the fundamental problems with the engine, or much care to.

The driving is solid IMO, but I am a casual enjoyer of racing games. Definitely harder to drive at the beginning (on normal difficulty) until you get around the drift and nitrous boost and buy some better parts for your car.

The story and dialogue can be abysmal at times. The budget for the story and voice-acting could have been spent better elsewhere IMO. You don't need much motivation to race, you can even make it campy a la MFS MW.

After finishing NFS Unbound, I must say that there are a lot of bugs, places you get stuck I had to leave the game and re-enter in order to get my car reset. The difficulty of the game, to be honest it's really challenging and not quite fair play, the functionality of the cars and their handling leaves many doubts about the control of the cars... especially the fast ones, with which you cannot take a normal turn without hitting something or help yourself with the handbrake in best scenario. Also the fact that you are crashing at any impact and roll over with the car is not quite ok.. and at a point in game, after each race you will have to run from the police, it gets quite annoying to be honest. Keep in mind that I selected also the ""relaxed"" version but I was feeling I was playing the game at high difficulty, doing my best to obtain 1st place after many restarts of the race. The option to earn extra cash on the cops, 2500 $ ..wow, extra for sure. The graphics and the effects are nice once you get used with it but I think your testers did not made their tasks good or perhaps the developers when it comes to the handling of the cars and difficulty of bots. 

I am lucky I purchased it with 13 euros, because this does not deserve 60 in these conditions. 
I hope with the next NFS you will exceed, like Heat was.. which I adored it.",1702122462,1704399338,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Long time fan of the need for speed franchise and I thought it would never sink lower than The Run, Prostreet and Shift but Unbound proved me wrong.

Graphism: It's alright, on today's most game level. But the effect, oh my gods the effects. What are you trying to do with this? Transform NFS into Fortnite??? Even during the cutscenes, are you sure you read the description that said you needed to devlop a videogame and not an 8 year old animated series???

Sound: Long time ago EA trax was a delight and gave us a mix between rap, rock and pop music. You can forget and eat the worst musical diarrhea hip hop has to offer. I don't talk about engine sounds since they're the exact same as heat and payback and need for speed (recycling is good but in videogames it's just plain lazyness and obvious budget cuts)

Gameplay: Same as heat, nothing new besides the nitro system but frankly what gives spending the whole bottle of you nitro just to overtake who isn't using it but is keeping up with you like his engine is twice powerfull as yours. 
And once again, it's Need for SPEED but where's the speed? at 220 km/h it feels like your car move like a truck at 90km/h

Story: Who wrote this cringy piece of garbage, Kathleen Kennedy??? The characters are awfully cliche and cringe. Those are adults not middle schoolers.

I don't know why EA is killing one of his most renowed and best selling license but they're doing it with dedication here.",1704380680,1704380838,False,1,1,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

No force feedback and the wheel sensitivity is almost nonexistent; you have to move the wheel a full 400 degrees in either direction to have any hope of turning so a controller is your best bet.  The gameplay is fun but quickly gets old and repetitive.  The cop system is so frustrating.  They aren't hard to get rid of but it's constant that you have to get rid of them.  The career is SO repetitive that if you have played an hour of the game then you have played the entire career.  All the upgrades are insanely expensive.  And all the characters -ugh- they are downright cringey.

There is some good here.  It took me back to playing Underground 2, so that felt good.   The livery creator seems to be somewhat robust.

Especially since im on hard and its incredibly difficult to even get 3rd place. given i only have 3 years of nfs experience. so yeah i say give this game a try if ur a nfs fan (spending full price on it is a dif story since i got it for $10)
Edit: i forgot to mention after 5 hours of playing my frames began to drop idk what that was about.. it stopped, but im going to switch to a downvote b/c the story's races are really redundant and annoying i like the challenge but after a while i put the game on easy b/c it took so long to grind for money and it still is. i feel this was a choice made to keep people playing the game i added a good 7 more hours and only made it to the first qualifier lol close to the second one.

So idk it sucks its not that good cause the racing is just hella fun but omg it gets kinda annoying especially after i just did multiplayer for the first time and for one it was 1v1 (either not enough ppl joined or thats just how ppl play online) and the guy kept ramming into my car and i couldnt do anything since i had no upgrades on the car... it felt so frustrating i just gave up and finished the race. the second race i did was S tier but the stock car i had couldnt keep up at all. I understand needing to upgrade but i wonder if a ""meta racing"" is even more prevelant in this game.. idk tho. And the maps look like they can get boring really fast. So for a $70 game Id be pretty dissappointed if i paid full price. Well they still got $10 outta me.
Hopefully the next game keeps this style but doesnt rush the game cause this geniunely was the most fun racing i had in a while",1704221832,1704338042,False,0,0,0.489795923233032227,0,True,False,False

The 25th instalment in the Need for Speed series, Unbound marks the return of the NFS franchise after a 3-year gap from 2019’s Heat. This review focuses on the single player campaign of the game. [/u]


[h3] TL;DR – Despite its rocky development and polarizing style, Unbound surprises as a surprisingly robust entry in the NFS series and easily one of the better entries in the past decade. [/h3]

Story (3/5) – NFS Unbound is set in the fictional city of Lakeshore, heavily inspired by the city of Chicago, where you compete in street races, cop chases and general shenanigans. The story is cut from the same cloth as previous street racing themed NFS titles. Just do not expect too much out of the writing. 

Gameplay (4/5) – The gameplay loops revolve around a day and night cycle where you compete in races leading up to a main event at the end of the week. Just like the previous entries, getting busted means you lose all earnings from the day/night session invoking a pseudo risk and reward system. As such, cop chases can be rather exhilarating especially when you have a lot of bank riding on that pursuit. Visual customization for the cars remains a big focus of NFS and Unbound remains to do it the best among all racing games out there, easily making up for the smaller roster of cars. 

Controls (4/5) - After two prior misfires (in Heat and NFS 2015), I am happy to report that Grip racing is finally viable and competitive. Drifting is a little more controllable now, especially if tuned correctly, but it can still be rather unpredictable at times. It plays well with a Xbox controller though, I would have hoped for better/customizable mapping to make shifting gears more ergonomic when driving with a manual transmission. 

Graphics (5/5) – Easily my favourite part of NFS Unbound. Rendered on the Frostbite Engine, the cars and environments look gorgeous whether it be day or night. Car models are highly detailed and stand out even more in the garage during customization. Meanwhile, character models are rendered in a cartoony, cel-shaded look with accompanying graffiti/comic book style art for the car’s effects. The latter addition is somewhat of a polarizing decision. Personally, I am a big fan of it.

Audio (4/5) – EA’s Studios has never been a slouch in the audio department regardless of the game and Unbound is no different. Unbound is best experienced on a pair of headphones. Exhaust tuning returns with the addition of sound effects (which can be turned off if desired), making the most of the audio flare. However, I did find the engine sounds rather muffled at times. Music choice is similarly polarizing though, I found it perfectly serviceable for the theme and tone the game was aiming for. 

Issues/Optimization – Running with an RTX 3090, I was able to run Unbound at a locked 4K90 throughout my playthrough with the graphics settings set to Auto. I only had one single hard crash throughout my ~57 hours playthrough. One recurring physics bug occurred upon landing from jumps and cause your car to slow down dramatically. It occurred <10 times but was a real pain every single time.

Overall (4/5) – Despite its rocky development tenure and poor marketing by EA, NFS Unbound is a genuinely enjoyable game and a worthwhile addition to the NFS Series. As a long standing fan of the series, I can certainly recognize the potential of what Criterion was trying to achieve here. The lack of post-campaign content (such as the much loved, Challenge Series) in favour of online play is a little disappointing though, the lengthy campaign does make up for it. I just hope that EA will continue to support the Need for Speed series especially since Unbound has shown serious signs of life.

(Spoilers ahead)

Driving feel:
The driving in Unbound is more slippy when trying to grip and you'll find yourself under steering a lot more. Some people are having issues with the drift mechanics when trying to grip but there is a setting to turn it off in the handling tab of the performance upgrades. Heat does come out on top in terms of the high speed racing, the motion blur in combination with the FOV makes it seem like you're going a lot faster than in Unbound. Not only that but the NOS in Heat feels a lot more powerful. The NOS burst in Unbound is an interesting mechanic that has won me races but the normal NOS kinda sucks, even the Elite bottles are underwhelming. 

Customization:
The customization of Unbound took the Already amazing customization from Heat and made it better. Unbound retains all the aspects from Heat such as most of the decals and body kits. Unbound adds to this by giving you almost twice as many decals and options for tires, body panels, kits, etc... They did keep all the decals from Heat so if you want to show off things like Status Error or Hazard Company in Unbound you can. Unbound also adds stuff like tags which I personally like (though they aren't for everybody). 

Cops:
The cops in Unbound are a lot easier than they are in Heat. Especially once you get an S or S+ car. While this is unfortunately the case, the reason I think that the cops aren't as difficult to deal with is due to the week progression system. When you race during the day and build up heat it doesn't reset when you switch to night. Due to this I was constantly dealing with heat 4-5 almost every night during the campaign. 

Story: I personally liked both the Heat and Unbound stories equally. Though I do believe the subplot of the Mayoral elections kinda seems oddly similar to the corrupt cops of the Heat campaign. The idea of corrupt cops and the player fighting back is a really interesting plot which they could've done more with, on top of the campaign in general being kinda short. The Unbound campaign was decently long and is more in tune with what an underground racing game should be. 

Post-Campaign/online:

The post game for both Heat and Unbound are boring since there's nothing to do once you've beaten the game. I wish EA allowed you to restart the campaign in both of these games and any future games. The online mode for Unbound is a little bit better since your progression doesn't transfer over. The money and cars you earned in the campaign transfer over but you have to unlock most of the dealer cars again. In my opinion this is better as it gives you something to work for in online mode. Also online mode in Unbound doesn't use the week progression system so for those of you who aren't fans of it can rest easy in online mode.

Music:
I don't understand why people are taking issue with it's a big step up from Heat and Unbound is one of the few games where I don't turn off the music.

Grinding:
If u complain about the grinding for some of the 1 mil cars then try War Thunder for a week. 

Politics: 
(Heat doesn't really go into politics at all so this doesn't apply to that game.)

One person mentioned how Unbound went ""woke"" in the Campaign which I honestly think is a double-edged sword.
On one hand it's a game about racing where politics shouldn't have a place. But on the other hand, politics opens up a lot of doors for a game like this. The aforementioned mayoral elections affects the campaign both in a literal sense and in the lore. As the weeks go by you actually start the day with heat before racing at all. In addition, the heat gains per race also increase as well. I also think that some of the skits on the radio we're kinda funny and reflect the current state of US politics.

[b] Story Wise... [/b] The story is actually good. But, the ""wokeness"" of the game could really compromise the grittiness of the story. I wish they could've toned it down a bit to a point where it's not heavily influenced by social media and stuff. Overall, I think there's always room to improve on.

[b] Customization Wise... [/b] This game has the biggest customization options I have ever seen in a game yet. From cars' roof being chopped down and gutted to removing both the front and rear bumpers. This game's customization can and will keep you busy fine tuning the visuals of your car. 

[b] The 'tags' or 'cartoon effects...' [/b] While it's great that EA/Criterion has given the player an option to turn off the effects, for me it kinda loses the essence of it being 'Unbound.' I mean, sure it's a little bit eye-straining since there's too much going on in the screen, but if you can appreciate it for what it is and not listen to what most people on the internet think about this game too much (kinda like pineapple on pizza), this game is really up to par.

[b] Physics and overall performance of the vehicles... [/b] This is where I hope they stopped using the 'tap brake to drift' formula. It kinda sucks. Going 120+mph on a straight is okay especially when the roads really open up, but when you're trying to attack a sharp curve with a grip build, the cars always wants to understeer out of you. It takes away the skill-curve if there is always a need to drift every single corner. Sure it helps when you're trying to run away from the cops, but, god, I don't really know how to explain it; it is an arcade racer but NFSMW 2005 was an arcade racer to. It forced the players to know how to drive fast without the need to drift every. single. corner. 

[b] Graphics, game engine, and etc. [/b] Obviously, the game is a reskinned copy of Need for Speed Heat. The physics and the assets come from the same game and there are times that it will really show that it's really just a reskinned game. I just HATE that this and the previous game have the same CPU-intensive issue where it's always bottlenecking. Sure, there are fixes out there but goodness I wish they would fix the optimization on this game. I run an 11th-gen Intel I5, with a GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop but get 49-60 frames inconsistently. 

[b] Music...[/b] I like RnB and rap music, but I kinda wish they added more variety to the list of soundtrack. I wouldn't want to listen to french RnB while going 200+mph on the freeway. 

[b] Online Mode... [/b] I haven't played online mode yet since I'm only on week 3 of the grand so, I'll come back to this once I start grinding online.",1704235915,1704236242,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

1. Grinden zur Hölle, um sich in der ersten Woche ein Auto aufzubauen was sich anfühlt wie ein 50PS Auto in der Beschleunigung. 
2. Das Driften fühlt sich einfach nur noch hakelig an, und im Grip kommt die Kiste nicht schnell um die Kurve. 
3. Die ewigen Zwischensequenzen am Anfang des Rennens nerven einen extrem wenn man mehrere Rennen am Stück fährt. 
4. Tuner Autos werden entfernt um Supersportler hinzuzufügen ??

1. Setting und Vibe des Games.

3. Story soweit ich diese bisher beurteilen kann. 

Dabei sind die Ansätze die verfolgt wurden in meinen Augen sehr gut, aber leider schlecht umgesetzt.

This game is a failure in many aspects and doesn't worth the price at any amount cause in the end this game intention is solely to wast your time. there are many things broken in this game but the bottom line on why is that is basically because they wanted to make you play longer and wast your time.

But most of all my biggest problem is that in this game in particular, you never get the feeling that you are driving a car that can exist on earth. the closest thing i can think of in regards to handling and how cars feel are those spaceship racers on steam. Driving can be fun and the sense of speed is the ""THE"" only good thing about this game with those effects that somehow works even though they match to nothing and absolutely no one. just a gimmick that turned out to be nice to look at. But beside that this game is a bad game in the sense of bugs, game-play, menu and UI, freaking story or online aspects.

In regards to bugs every time i start the game it goes to minimized mode and sometimes i don't notice when its running, i can't quite the game whilst roaming the city cause i get stuck 98% of the times in a loading screen and i need to end task it. some times i get the button sound effects stuck in the garage which i thought at first it was part of the music that was playing since almost all of the musics in this game are absolute trash and i thought oh this artist stole from that other one cause i can recognize that stupid sound and then i realized ohh that's a bug and not part of the trash rap. beside that i should say that game can look nice in certain places and ran fine on my rather old setup (1080gtx,i787k,16g) which is a good thing i guess. 

In the game play aspect i was always kept asking myself why did they make this game so infuriating? why did they want me to crash all the time? what is the point of all these cops? and then i realized they just want me to play longer and that's it. so let me just expand on those two problems and then you decide, for example in older NFS games i could always imagine that the traffic if not random had some kind of logic behind it and if i was a better driver i could have thread the needle there and escaped and usually i crashed cause i didn't pay attention. but in this game cars actively spawn in front of you and you alone, many many times i saw a truck or sedan spawn in front me when i was going fast which was super annoying since the cars spawn with their lights on first than the whole car appears which makes them like a ghostly buzzkill which you have no remedy against and you just have to eat it. then the AI overtakes and since the game solely focuses on you, the AI makes a huge leap in front of you and you have no hope of catching it. and most races involve police chases which behave like traffic that spawns all around you and rams you at every chance. and in that scenario you might want to restart and then you see oh they made restarts limited to 10 for each day and since you need them more for night races cause they reward a bit more money you are stuck with the decision, whether eat the unfair lost or risk the night races. and the traffic directly spawns on the apex of each corner or under bridges in darkness which since your car is a spaceship on rail stuck to this line, means you will going to crash, multiple times. i don't mind getting good i like that. but how can you get good at invisible oncoming traffics? there are so much more that can be said about game play and how atrocious it can get but i decided to pick the part that is like 90% in your face all the time.

In regards to UI, everything is so badly designed and all the symbols and buttons are so unnecessarily busy, for example i had started a drift race by mistake like 6 times with a grip only car cause the icon for the races are so similar and everything is painted like a hyperactive 6 yearold was left alone with some bland pictures and markers to an extent that i had to read the description of the races to know which one is which and even then it was hard to decide between cornering races or drift or some dirt ""inspired"" crash into things and drift/jump race. this aspect was a huge step back.

In regards to story this game insist on having one, which i am fine with but if you are incapable of doing even the basics of story telling or at least keeping yourself under 60% cringe amount why do you even bother with it? more importantly why do you bother me with it? i skipped everything every chance i had cause i knew there was no pay off or weight to anything about it and i was right since to my recollection it was a story about a revenge where everyone are good people who there is nothing they can do that requires even the notion of consequence in any sense and some bloger/streamer/podcast thingy that tries so hard to sound like a real woman person which just none stop goes hard on cringe attack on your soul. i am ok with cringe but it seems like every time i say that someone takes it as if i was thirsty and asked for water and they decided to waterboard me. its not fair, i just want balanced thing half cringe half story with things that matter... in this game just mute the dialog and hit skip every chance you get. and it seems even the people who made the game knew everyone skips their work since they added a short summery text explaining what you just skipped which i would be fine with if an AI narrator just read that out loud in front of image of a car image and they could have spend more time on the actual game.

In regards to online aspect i should say it is the most stupid section of it, they are trying to make it into cod like separate modes for single and multi but they forgot why people played cod campaigns (until mw3 i guess) and what that means is that nothing you do in the story beside some basic story section cars that can be available in the mp matters outside of the story mode. if you spent so much time tring to buy a Bugatti in sp well you have to do that again in mp and even before that you have to unlock it in mp too. such a stupid system. and beside that i had this 97 mclaren F1 which was given to me for buying the game in some weird package idk what (i bought the palace thing for heavy discount at about i think 12 bucks) and i upgraded that and that car killed every race on sp (s and s+) and then you get that same car in mp as well and if you set it up with all the max stuff and supercharger you have a S+400 car that sticks to road like a train on rails and warp speeds every where. now there are other bugged cars in mp of course but when everyone is busy crashing into each other and traffics all the time it doesn't really matter how good your car or your driving is, it is just basically a game of plinko and you are taking orders from the rng system.

What a waste... this game doesn't worth it at any price since it will cost you more in your time and patience than the actual money you pay. and i mean it with the discount, i cannot believe people paid 70+ for this game. and it has store btw too so hahaha idk.",1703292660,1704220474,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- A good NFS game and a good racing game. I've played Unbound, Heat, Payback, 2015, Rivals, Most Wanted 2012, & Hot Pursuit 2010, and this is my favorite out of those.


[b]Pros[/b]

- Driving Mechanics & Handling: Makes grip & drift handling feel rewarding, burst nitrous system rewards players for solid cornering & taking risks
- Multiplayer: More stable connection, better matchmaking, more updates than in the previous NFS games.
- Car Classes: Cars are categorized in tiers B, A, A+, S, &S+ based on performance. Allows for cars to be upgraded to move between tiers & more car diversity & balance
- Performance Tuning: Options to upgrade performance & tweak performance if car isn't to your liking
- Customization: As good as Heat, if not better
_ Visuals & Soundtrack: A unique look, expressive, but not completely over the top mix of cel-shaded & previous NFS graphics. Soundtrack has hip-hop, & electronic genres mainly. Great if you're an ASAP Rocky fan.

[b]Mixed[/b]

- Story: Solid Premise, Main Characters, and concept, but the middle of the story is a bit repetitive and supporting characters could be used more
- Police: Rewards driving skill, & evasive maneuvers, solid damage & police tiers. Stealth based system can get annoying & police AI could be more aggressive. Overall decent & better than people give credit for.
- Soundtrack: Can get repetitive, some tracks used mainly in meetups & menu, but not races.",1704159037,1704159037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the pros to this game don't outweigh the cons and it's a shame the NFS games in are this shape when you consider the absolute home run each game was back in the day.

I really like how this game really challenges the players because most of the games right now are so easy with no progression. Yeah, it's a bit grindy, but isn't it how it should work which you have to build from the bottom? See its competitor for example, a BWM Supra at the start, Like wtf? Yeah sure, some of the soundtrack is not that good but also some of them, I really enjoy hearing it while racing. The controls just need some adapt when you first start playing. Then, the artstyle of the game. People have been hating on it and well, it depends on you. For me, I really like it because it is what makes the game different.

What I really don't like is actually the story. Idk man it just feels so bad. After the ending, I was wondering who is the real antagonist throughout the story? The character just does not leave that impression to be called antagonist. Then also, why would you separate single player and multi player?? Like why bro, why??? Just make it like Heat and everything is okay, right?

first impression - start the game only for it to install EA bloatware. off to a terrible start. 

second impression - no sound during the opening cutscene. time to get hype for the game to come? nah. dead air.

third - ""choose a car to fix up"", and I think ""sweet. i love progression mechanics. start off with a junker, win money, slowly fix it up over time. i am IN!"" .... loading screen .... and the car I chose is suddenly in mint condition. wtf. why even set it up as a fixer upper, just ... what?!

fourth - waypoints. gawd i hate waypoints. at least I knew from reviews to expect them and was hoping I would be able to overlook them once I got into the fun of the game, but no. tight tolerances on the waypoint hitbox, so i could slide around a corner, mounting a curb a bit, still entirely in the race, BUT NO, too far outside the waypoint. reset in the road with zero momentum. gm,bnaskjdfglkjas.

fifth - cops. are. everywhere. when I finally got to the open world map I drove by maybe 4 cops in 7 blocks. none of them responded at all to me buzzing right by them / driving in opposing traffic / smashing through benches and pedestrians / speeding by at 120mph (actually couldn't believe that's what the speedometer read. felt and looked like 60mph tops). SO many cops, and yet they might as well have not been there. then when I was in a daytime race, there were even more cops! not like they'd intentionally showed up to break up the meetup, just cops supposedly casually cruising the roads. a dozen of them or more in a couple mile sprint race. absurd. one of them was t-boned into a wall and just stayed there, gunning the engine into the wall. fantastic AI. 

i wanted to like this game. i decided to wait for it on sale after it got poor reviews, and now having picked it up at a whopping 83% off, I'm still not happy with the purchase.

The vibe is street based. Rap music and ethnic characters abound. Those looking for a for Rock or Heavy Metal themed game will thumb this down. Old people who aren't locked into current urban culture will probably dislike Unbound as well. Those of us who love the music and customization allotted to your character and car will most likely be in minority on this game.

I bought NFS Heat and Unbound recently on sale. Both have good graphics and smooth gameplay. So far, I like the story better in Heat. The banter between characters in Unbound so far, is a bit dull. Cops will be all over you in both games but I've been able to avoid them easier in Unbound. There should also be an interior view for all cars in any dedicated racing game.

After I finished NFS Heat, I decided to pick this up during the sale. Some people told me to avoid it, but I rather be my own person and develop my own opinions first, instead of just following the bandwagon.

Yes, I've seen and heard all of the ""conversations"" that this game has brought up, from release day up until now. People [b]genuinely[/b], [b]wholeheartedly[/b] acted like this game came out of one of the seven gates of hell, especially the art style, which was the main talking point. I was a bit turned off at first, but it grew on me, especially since there were racing games in the past with unique art styles. Hell, even Nitro was one of them, despite it being a Nintendo exclusive. 

I've been playing NFS games for years, and I knew that the community were something else. Seeing all of the talk about this actually made me realize something: [b][i]Need For Speed is one of the only game franchises that gets criticized for taking a gamble and trying something different.[/i][/b]

[i]ProStreet, that was criticized.[/i] [i]Undercover, that was criticized.[/i] [i]Shift, that was also criticized.[/i] The Run, MW2012, Rivals, [b]you name it[/b], every NFS game that was something other than ""buy jdm car tune it and tear up da street"" was bashed, and it only took some people years to appreciate it. 

If NFS just succumbed to the hate, this franchise [b]wouldn't[/b] exist today.

[b]Anyways, let me get to the actual review:[/b]
Need For Speed Unbound isn't a game that everyone would like, but [b]it's one that everyone should try.[/b] Watching videos and reading reviews is one thing, but once you play it for yourself, it's an entirely different world. I've experienced the highest of highs, beating my opponents by the slimmest of margins after looking like the underdog for the majority of the race, to being at the absolute bottom of the barrel, losing hundreds of thousands of my hard-earned cash because I either got clocked by a Heavy or ran straight into a Ford Explorer at over 180 mph like an absolute imbecile because I wanted to weave through traffic in my McLaren F1 that requires more precision than professional darts.

[h1][b]The Pros:[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*]The graphics are stunning. The roads, the buildings, the lighting, and the materials, are way better than Heat, and it's arguably the closest that we've gotten to 2015, considering that the time isn't fixed and the lighting isn't just baked everywhere.
[*]The car list has improved compared to its predecessors. They brought back a classic manufacturer in Bugatti and improved on the already existing ones. There's an S14, an RX8, a Hellcat Charger, a 190E, Emira, Urus, GT Black Series, Eclipse, etc. Very, very good selections with good customization. 
[*]Speaking of customization, it's also improved massively. The Legendary Customs kits are sick, it's like the Elite kits that were in NFS World; just aggressive, bold, feisty kits that break necks. 
[*]The physics genuinely feel better than Heat, especially the drifting. In Heat, it felt kinda stiff depending on the vehicle. It wasn't my favorite, but it was okay. In Unbound, cars can hook to the pavement but also kick out their rear end when needed, and you won't lose too much momentum because of it. Also, the car doesn't deadlock anymore once you come off of a drift.
[*]The handling tuning is improved with the addition of the grip/drift slider. You can either make it more grippy, or more drifty, and it's not a sharp difference. Even if your car is more drift-oriented, you can still grip through corners with ease as long as you manage the throttle.
[*]The destructible objects are way better than before. In Heat, if you so much tapped those barriers during the day races, you can kiss your speed goodbye. It was so annoying losing half of your momentum just because you went a bit wide. 
[*]The economy is better. Money actually has importance instead of having to grind to level 39 just to get a new diff or a turbo. Cars aren't cheap, and you really have to manage your money so that you'll have enough for certain events or for the qualifier.
[*]The events are good, and the format is cool. I love the betting feature since it also adds another factor to the race. Not only do you have to win, but you have to beat your rival to get paid.
[*]The racers actually have their own personalities, even more than Heat did. Heat had some racers that had lines and their own designs, but with Unbound, just about everyone has their own voice, style, car, nationality, etc. It gives the game a pop that the previous games didn't really have because you only saw other cars instead of the people behind them.
[*]The car transport missions were a great addition. They're not just a way to get a good payout when the race selection is dry, but they also allow trying out a new car every time. At day, it's to set a fast time. But at night, it's a matter of bringing it in one piece while cops are on you. (The Firebird is nuts)
[*]The player customization is sick. In Heat, there was a good variety, but most were just reskins. Here, there are dozens of jackets, shirts, pants, shoes, etc. Even the eye color and hair color are changeable. (Don't know why we don't have socks, though.)
[*]With the Palace Edition, I actually [i]like[/i] the fact that they don't just hand us over the cars on a silver platter. Starting out with a solid, A-class Golf is ridiculous. Some of the best games in the franchise had slow starter cars. The starter car selection is also good here, with a lot of choices.
[*]I actually liked the soundtrack, especially the international songs. ""Punya Paap"", ""Tłoki"", and ""Je ne sais pas"" are bangers.
[*]And last, but not least, the story was genuinely great. You had something, then you lost it, and you take on all of the challenges ahead to get back what was rightfully yours. Sounds similar to a fan-favorite of the series, eh? There are also turning points, climaxes, and character development throughout. 
[/list]

[h1][b]The Cons:[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*]The cops sometimes don't feel as aggressive as they should be. Personally, I didn't feel concerned about anything until I got up to Heat 5. You do have to actually outsmart them, though.
[*]The cop spotting time can be annoying at times.
[*]If you wreck out in a race, that's the end of your day/night, even if you still have restarts.
[*]The Ride Stance is yet again underwhelming. No track width, no rake, and no tire width, also, some cars don't go low enough without bags.
[*]The rim selection did improve with the turbofans, but it's still a downgrade with the loss of Wantanabes and the continued absence of Rays and Enkei. Plus, the existing brands in this game didn't get any new additions.
[*]Some of the returning cars in the game didn't get any new kits or lost some that were there previously. 
[*]Some of the menus are a bit tedious to navigate, like scrolling down to find a specific rim because it wasn't in alphabetical order. 
[*]The game recycles some track layouts, which can get boring.
[*]The Heat F1 should have been an online-only reward IMO. Getting a top-tier, million-dollar car for free kinda feels like cheating, but, I did use it, so I can't complain that much. (I didn't want to blow that entry money)
[*]Some of the DLC is recycled Heat cars.
[*]The random crashes were probably the worst out of the bunch. Luckily, I didn't lose progress, but I kept the heat. I managed to patch it up by clearing the shader cache, and my settings, and applying the Heat CPU Fix. (May differ for other people)
[*]Still no PlayStation button prompts. It doesn't bug me, but most triple-A titles nowadays have that.

The cityscape is a masterpiece, a neon-soaked playground that begs to be explored. The attention to detail is astonishing; every turn, alley, and towering skyscraper is meticulously crafted, making the urban jungle a canvas for speed demons.

""Unbound"" isn't just about the speedometer hitting astronomical figures; it's a celebration of the art of driving. The car roster is a dream for petrolheads, featuring a diverse selection that spans from classic muscle cars to futuristic hypercars. Each vehicle is a work of mechanical art, and the customization options are a petrolhead's dream come true. Whether you prefer the roar of a V8 engine or the hum of an electric motor, ""Unbound"" caters to every taste.

The racing dynamics are a harmonious blend of arcade-style accessibility and realistic physics. Drifting around corners feels intuitive, and the sense of control is empowering. The police chases, a staple of the Need for Speed series, are more intense than ever, with law enforcement AI that adapts to your tactics, keeping you on the edge of your seat.

One of the standout features of ""Unbound"" is the day-night cycle and dynamic weather system. Racing under the moonlight brings a new layer of challenge and beauty, while sudden rainstorms turn the streets into a slippery battleground. The visual effects are nothing short of spectacular, adding an extra layer of immersion to an already captivating experience.

The soundtrack deserves a special mention, featuring a curated mix of tracks that complement the high-octane action perfectly. From heart-pounding beats to soulful tunes, the music adds another dimension to the game, syncing seamlessly with the rhythm of your races.

While ""Unbound"" is a visual and auditory feast, it does have a few bumps in the road. The storyline, while engaging, might feel a bit cliché to some players, and the character development is somewhat predictable.

The story is not particularly good and it suffers from bad writing at multiple times: Yaz and Tess are the scum of the earth and I wanted to punch them in the face multiple times, but my character never did that. Only character i liked to some extent was Rydell. At least the story is serviceable and better than Heat.

The gameplay is similar to Heat with the bullshit ""Break to Drift"" mechanic but they added a nitrous boost. I prefer using the grip setting because its faster, and with the addition of the nitrous boost its actually SUPER satisfying to get a corner just right and then push the boost button to get a massive speed increase. Another aspect are the police chases, they can be challenging but they get annoying real fast. Fortunately, you can skip them by leaving the game and the loading your save.

A controversial aspect about Unbound however, was the cartoon effects and graphics. I actually liked them, and they gave the game a visual style that differentiates it from the rest of arcade racers (not that there are a lot of them currently). Other than that, the realistic graphics on the cars are INSANE, and the game runs silky smooth. The world is kinda dull because its based on Chicago but its well made.

The soundtrack is awful, like really awful. When I play a racing game I expect fast paced music and not this trap bullshit. I muted the music after 1 hour of gametime and played a racing tracklist on Youtube instead.

It's not the worst NFS, but it's worth about 1/3 of its price in its current state and is guaranteed to heavily fray your nerves. Pick Heat instead if you haven't played that yet.

The pros:
- Looks great overall, the cars particularly look and sound superb
- Customisation is essentially the same as in Heat, but works well
- Extremely abundant selection of vinyls
- Separation of races and tuning levels into tiers encourages keeping several cars
- The days/nights/week system is cool & enforces some variety after finishing the campaign instead of repeating the same races over and over to farm
- Actual buy-in fees for races raise the stakes in a realistic fashion
- Takedown races are fun, they should become an NFS staple
- The soundtrack, while having some Interesting Choices, also features some real bangers
- Great atmosphere, reminiscent somewhat of the Undergrounds but also with its own unique flavour
- Eclipse GSX!!!

The cons:
- Complete separation of multi and single player. Do you seriously expect me, after having worked my ass off in the SP campaign, to start again from complete scratch? With NO AI opponents to boot, forcing me to compete against the maximum potential number of zero-sportsmanship a-holes every single race? To quote one of the less illustrious pieces of music from the game: are you sh-tting me?
- During high tier grip races in SP, the game always appoints one opponent who will drive the Millenium Falcon with Anakin's reflexes. No mistakes, insane speed, kkthxbai. You make one single mistake and you can immediately say goodbye to first place. Great ""challenge"".
- The difficulty setting has no bearing on this. Opponents will still drive as if on rails, that one a-hole will still reach warp speeds, the only difference is perhaps losing a couple less neurons if you have more retries. Do yourself a favour and pick Relaxed, I guarantee the gameplay itself will not be any less challenging.
- The limited retries. Dear devs, sit on a cactus for this one. The *concept* has merit as a way of raising the stakes, but all it serves in the context of how the rest of this game actually turned out, is to send the player into a rage much easier.
- Handling. It depends heavily on the car you pick, with some being quite okay and others extremely difficult to keep under control at higher speeds. Being sent flying off the pavement has never been easier in NFS. Also drift racing controls and feels like sh-t compared to some previous titles.
- The f-king wrap bug. Whenever you switch cars at any point in the game, the vinyls on the right side and sometimes front of the car will load as just black silhouettes. The only way to fix this is to enter the customisation menu with said car. Several people have reported this since the game came out. It's now in f-king Season 5 of live updates and EA has done nothing to fix this. It is incredibly annoying in a game about customising your own cars, and greatly sums up the general QoL level of this game.
- NFS has always struggled with getting cops right. In this instance they're not unstoppable one-touch death machines like in Heat, but the sheer number of them at higher heat levels is absolutely surreal. It's like every 2 cars out of 3 in the city are cops. It's hilarious, but also incredibly annoying if you're just trying to get home after a long day of racing.
- Drift racing kinda sucks as mentioned
- Still no drag racing

There's a bunch more smaller problems that are still worth nitpicking, but I have to end this review at some point, so.

There might also be a Rockstar influence, since AI traffic will slam on the brakes, swerve, and sometimes even leave the road, specifically to run into players. This happens about as often as it did in Heat, inching threateningly towards GTA V.

Story mode has some of the worst and weirdest rubber-banding of the series, causing AI opponents to flip-flop between F1 and (parked) golf carts. While I often prove my automotive prowess by slamming into walls, I can still hold my own on ""Challenging"" difficulty. After one such brick inspection went particularly awry, opponents slowed down to below traffic speed and waited for me. Prior to said incident, they simply disappeared off the starting line and left me in the dust. I may suck, but I'm confident I can at least hold down a button or two to go straight. For the remainder of that race, it felt like each of them (except for the usual leader) lost a piston and never quite recovered. Side bets will also band yer rubbers real good - even bottom-rated opponents somehow find a way to magically shoot up the leaderboard, sometimes even taking the lead for a solid chunk of the race.

Overall, a solid downgrade from Heat, and as much as I liked it, that game already had significant issues. I can only recommend getting this game when it's *at least* 50% off, and you really don't mind any form of (probably EA-patented at this point) arcade racer BS.

I normally avoid voicing opinions with so little time on the clock, but the level and consistency of my disappointment at this point is as severe as it is surprising.


Edit:
It seems all Lakeshore PD vehicles come equipped with explosive reactive armor as standard. Simply touching a cop car in this game always comes with receiving a fixed minimum amount of damage, equivalent to most head-on collisions with traffic or walls. This happens regardless of speed, angle, force of impact, or virtually anything else.

Sadly, this appears to be a yet another hacky ""fix"" for the otherwise stupid (bordering on non-existent) cop AI. Combined with overtuned spawn rates and cheating AI, this essentially turns high-heat chases into total dice rolls, rather than tests of skill. With all their own flaws, NFS releases from over 15 years ago actually have better cop systems, and that's just depressing.",1703798259,1703956241,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The level of cringe in NFS Unacceptable is on a level I've never encountered before. Who wrote the characters, dialogue and story? The lowest lifeforms existing in the sewers would shun this drivel. Even Starfield is better than this, and that mess was a steaming pile of inter-galactic failure.

Do you like music? Not after experiencing this ""delight"" you won't. Well, if you want something to bash your head against a wall to, then this is what you want. Hands down the worst soundtrack to any Need for Speed game ever. Honestly, no game deserves the fate of this soundtrack.

Have you ever wanted to play a racing game where you often find some loudmouth back-seat driver sitting in the passenger seat? Just imagine, everywhere you go, a Greta will be with you.

The game also suffers from ""Tell, don't show"" mentality. For example, I got to an important event where I wanted to see the reaction of the characters and how the story would develop, but no! I got a paragraph of text on the screen about what happened at the meet. The standards are subterranean in regards to presentation and immersion.

I suppose I should say something positive about NFS Unbearable. The graphics are pretty good I guess.

You can change it to look more realistic, but you'll still see these plague emissions on other cars and new vehicles you haven't freed from illness yet.

The customization is fun as usual and the car selection is alright-- but the game doesn't handle or play as well as they used to.

Here is 10 things I feel need to be mentioned here...  They aren't all bad.

1 - The story is 100% crap, with even worse voice acting, as you would expect from any NFS title. 
2 - The cars in the game handle more like cars in The Crew, than NFS Heat.
3 - They didn't give the option to turn off the art crap, but they did finally in the latest patch give the option to turn your distracting personal art effects off...  That was a good enough compromise that made it ok for me to spend $13 dollars on it, lol.
4 - The car selection sucks, seems like a severely crippled rehash of NFS Heat.
5 - The progression system in story mode sucks all the balls, and the amount of garbage you have to do to unlock decent rides in Online Mode is ridiculous (more than half the cars are hidden behind achievements like ""Win 50 S Class Races"")
6 - The performance upgrades, and the effects they have on the cars are laughable. For instance, there is no reason a 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer with a stock engine loaded with top performance parts can outperform a 2018 Porsche 911 Turbo S Exclusive also loaded with max level parts.
7 - The graphics especially with Ray-Tracing are gorgeous.
8 - The Soundtrack is oh so terrible.
9 - Chicago. Love it.
10 - Cops are fairly easy to ditch, even at Heat 5.

Let's start with the fact that every time I buy a game from EA, I have to reinstall this fking app because it won't launch. Are you saying it's my computer? No, it's the problem of the company that makes a lot of money on dlckheаds and their sports games but can't make a normal app (hey, Ubisoft, I hate you too with your app, I don't remember what it's called). 

And so, I reinstalled Origin once again, but it all came down to the fact that my car just did not want to go, I pressed the gas and it goes a maximum of 80-100 km and that's it, I dug into the settings, but never found anything, then I went to the Internet, saw a ton of guides to a ton of problems with this game and decided that EA can kiss my a$s, I hope the dudes who buy sports games will wise up and you will go bankrupt.

Very little brain was used in making this game, focusing on Anime factors and effects which people didn't cared much.

Instead should have focused on story, which is missing, there is only grinding in story mode, and the grinding is not random, its a set of events we have to pick and do to earn in-game currency, which is the only way you can buy and upgrade cars, car parts and garage. 

Online have exact same races as story mode, same tracks. (Very lazy to do so)

I got it on sale, otherwise I would not have bought it... I play the need for speed games casually, as a calm game to play. So as I do with every need for speed game, I set the difficulty to Relaxed, because I just want to race a car and have fun. However it's not fun when you can't win any race even on the easiest difficulty.
The story is great though, however, I cannot advance in the story because I have come to a race that I just can't beat.
Another issue I have with Unbound is that there are 5 tiers of cars, B, A, A+, S, and S+
And you can only race your car at a race that has the same tier. In Need For Speed Heat, The level ""requirement"" was just a suggestion, and you could race your car at that race whether you had a better, worse, or equal level.
That is not the same here.
I urge you not to waist your money on this game, it sucks
I regret spending my money on it, I didn't read the comments and I regret it. Because if I had, I would have seen the vast amount of negative comments.
There are a few good things that they did better, For Example:
They have moving trains I like this a lot
The graphics are fun, not extremely realistic, like a mix between Cartoony and realistic
The story is amazing

AI drivers cheat excessively.

Its possible that the game is designed like this in the beginning to give you the feeling that as you upgrade, you feel more powerful, but I don't like it. Maybe that isn't fact, but that's what it feels like and it is cheap. (challenging difficulty). Just to test it, I went to WeMod and enabled infinite nitro.

the good...

- cops don't instantly spot you when you get in distance of them. they have a meter that when fills up they will spot you. it's faster the higher heat level you have.
- the car selection in this game is pretty good. eclipse, nsx, r35 nismo, and so on. not bad at all.
- the controls are way better in my opinion. they take a bit it get used to (just coming from nfs heat) but they feel heavier like an actual car. and the drifting is a little harder to master. but when you do it feels amazing. 
- talking during races and other activities, although it can get a little cheesy and repetitive, its still nice other than just the background tracks.
- more to do than nfs heat. other than races, you have takeovers, one on one races, car delivery missions, and uber driver missions. (picking somebody up and taking them to a safehouse that you can then use)
- the turbo noises and exhausts sound MUCH better over nfs heat. and you can adjust how loud the blow off is.

the bad

- WHY THE F**K CAN I NOT UPGRADE MY CAR? well even if you have the money and the parts unlocked, you CAN NOT upgrade past a certain point until you play further in the story. you have to unlock higher car ranks to be able to upgrade to a higher rank... stupid
- the car effects... love them or hate then... they are there. some are kinda nice and others are very distracting. they don't add much. i like the character models but they don't fit in a realistic world. they would have looked better in an entire world in that art style.
- i don't like how you have to go to car meets and initiate a race there and only do it once, instead of them being around the map and you could replay them just with less money. i hate having to pay into races. it feels much harder to earn money.
- the difficulty is immense, nfs heat had really annoying cops, and this game has some really hard racers to beat. and you can't upgrade your car anymore because you're too high of a level to upgrade. making you replay over and over until you get first. and you only have 10 replays a day.
- your heat level goes through the day into the night and only resets after a full day. making me not want to do much during the day so i don't have a high heat level at night.
- the story and characters are laughable. the cheesy writing, the dumb story. i wont spoil it but don't expect much from the story. most of the characters are just annoying and never shut up, but good thing you can mute voices in settings.
- the nos system... i don't like it. you have a bar that fills up overtime and you can fill faster by doing tricks and stuff. but you have another layer of yellow nos. this fills up the more you do consecutive tricks. and you can only use it IMMEDIATELY after filling it up. you will lose it in a few seconds and it only gives you a little burst. i don't like it. much prefer hfs heat nos. fills up slowly then just absolutely rips it when you hit the button, then fills back up.
- THE SOUNDTRACK SUCKS. MUTE IT AND PLAY YOUR OWN MUSIC

there are other things a like and hate, but honestly if you like nfs heat, pick this up on sale. i got it for $10 during a Christmas sale, and it was well worth the $10. it is fun. although some things are really stupid. but still a good time.",1703737426,1703737596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Compared to Heat, the characters in general are less likable and more annoying. I can still remember a few people from Heat, but I've already forgotten the name of the main villain of the game. As for the car handling, its definitely improved, but still bad overall. Cars still don't feel as good to drive as Carbon or The Run, but you can still have a lot of fun tearing up roads.

The map is on par with Heat IMO. A lot of the roads actually feel like a carry over from Heat, but the city center is vastly different. The cops are less challenging this time around, and are honestly more annoying than challenging. I didn't have a problem running circles around heat level 5 with an A class car (the 2nd class in the game.) 

Overall, I'd recommend this game if you liked Heat. If you didn't like Heat, this game might be worse for you. I'd give the game a 7/10. Fun, but flawed.",1703721998,1703722106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EA have 2 teams that make most recent Need for Speed games. Ghost games, who made NFS 2015, Payback and Heat. And Criterion who made Hot pursuit, NSF:Most Wanted (2012) and Unbound. That's why they often feel different from previous versions. Personally I really like Criterion games because I'm a big fan of the Burnout series of racing games they made before EA bought them out, I like how their cars handle. And Unbound is no different, the cars handle well.

I can understand the dislike for the art style, it's a bit quirky & different, each to their own on that but I think it's done pretty well, I like it more than I expected. 

Unbound runs a LOT better than Heat though, it's seems more optimised and also has DLSS 3 support, which Heat doesn't have.

And the another reason why I marked my review as good, is because this game is really amazing. True NFS is back completely! Even Heat was very good too, but it needed some improvements with cop pursuits, but in this series(Unbound) each gameplay mechanic is AWESOME!
And you really feel that it is new level of gameplay comparing with previous parts.
Also this idea with combination of cartoon and realistic graphics is unbelievable! I think that I dreamed about this like graphics long time ago, and it is done!

The dialogue is cringe, even for a NFS game, which isn't a series known for its story anyway.
Cops are pathetically dumb, to the point where they crash themselves or get lost if you take a turn.
Traffic in this game has no logic - I've seen traffic driving in reverse going 60 mph, or just deciding lanes don't matter and driving sideways across the highway, or launching themselves off of a cliff.
The cars handle strangely, even for an arcade racer.  Most of my first 3 hours were spent sliding and crashing.
The effects, even though you can turn them off, are ugly and distracting.
The monetization in this game is disgusting (but it is EA™, after all).
The graphics somehow look worse than Heat, even though this game is its successor.  The pop-in of textures is pretty bad and the character models being a strange cell-shaded design looks super out of place.  Nothing in the game feels sharp.

Pretty much the only thing this game has over Heat is a higher level of customization on the cars, but even then, not by much.

If you can get this game on deep sale (Under 10 dollars), and you really need a racing game to play but have played everything else, then this is maybe not terrible.  But even then, you'll probably be disappointed.

+ Races are short/no grind (old Grand Turismo players know what Im talking about)

However it is a solid game, I had a lot of fun so far, and you can go to town with customization if you have the time to fine tune little details. It is more intensive on the CPU than on the GPU (Auto graphics, 1080p, i7 12650 H + 3050 laptop gpu) and I get between 70 to 80fps. 

Doesn't feel pay to win, and having the skill and previous experience from similar titles (Payback/Heat) is rewarding. 

Cop chases are not that bad, if you use BlackBox era tactics you actually come on top all the time. The cop chatter is hilarious to hear, despite getting repetitive. 

Online is pretty fun, I love to play the hell out of linkups, gauntlets and help other players escape the cops. The racing part has its quirks like broken cars that are meta and impossible to beat in PvP ('76 Golf, Skyline KPGC-10. Regera, Exige). However, if you don't obsess over being 1st every single time, things will be okay, in the end I play Unbound as a way to have fun. 

If you treat the game as an arcade racer, you'll have fun and you won't be disappointed. As an NFS vet enjoyer, (since Hot Pursuit 1998), I'd say is a nice addition. 

Story mode might be cheesy at times, but come on, if an NFS story ain't cheesy, it ain't NFS. I enjoyed the humor, especially taking jabs at Rydell being unaware of modernity and social media.",1703573356,1703573423,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Coming from heat a lot feels the same(Which is good, I liked heat), but the addition of boost building with tricks, tailing someone, having the possibility for a proper start boost and satisfying visuals makes this game-play wise a lot more interesting to me.

They changed the retry system though, depending on whether you had a rough time with heat that might not be for you.
Also know that it definitely is more an arcade racer than a sim racer, the physics are WILD at times. But speeding into a cop and gaining a full boost from KO'ing them feels AWESOME

I don't like the cell shaded characters, however I do like the customization options. The game is very grind heavy so keep that in mind. It's also very cheesy story-wise, it's this bad boy aesthetic it's trying to achieve and I'm all for it (It's not good though lol)

It's nothing like the older NFS games, so I get why a lot of people don't like it. However, I think it's good in its own right.

[b]The game is grindy![/b]
Yes it is, however for me it wasn't boring or annoying to do because I had fun collecting money to build different cars for different classes and race types, also driving around and getting collectibles was also alright too. This is weird for me, since I can get easily bored doing grinds or collectibles, but this game somehow made it fun for me.

[b]Story/style of game is cringe! [/b]
There are few characters who talking like 10 years old with weird slang, but not every character is like that. Also, few characters are actually characters and have proper development throughout the game. Not even mentioning to some fourth wall breaking topics and questions which the game brings up throughout the playthrough, making it more interesting and not ""cringe"". The style of the game is unique, and I do understand that some people don't like this kind of visuals, but I was okay with it. It wasn't annoying nor distracting to watch for me.

[b]Game is too difficult! [/b]
Not gonna lie, this is the first NFS after I don't know how many years, where it had some challenge in the story. Races are not easy, you need to use your nitro and boost properly and strategies to have a good finish, because you don't have to win every race, you just need to get money. Police chases got more difficult as well, since the AI got a bit more advanced and they can actually make your time more difficult. You can get to high heat levels early pretty fast, where you can get destroyed easily if you don't know what are you doing. Not even mentioning the 3 difficulty levels, well at first I tried to go on the hardest difficulty but after seeing the drift scores to beat, I decided to stick to challenging difficulty. I understand some people disappointment with this part, but I was delighted to see that this game is actually not ""a pushover"" and I have to try harder to beat the police or the races to advance, so git gud.

[b]Controls are trash! [/b]
Sadly the controls were annoying in Heat as well, but it somewhat got better in Unbound in my opinion, it's not that understeery than it was before and it don't get too drifty that many times. I can recommend playing with traction control on when you drive A+ or higher class cars, which helped to control my cars. Also, you have to understand the pros and cons for grip and drift cars. I'm not saying Criterion did wonders with this control scheme, but it's not that bad than it was before, but this is certainly a field to get better for the devs.

[b]Game is not optimized / Multiplayer is unplayable due to disconnects! [/b]
On lowest settings playing in fullHD I had 60 FPS no problem on PC, meanwhile the game was still alright looking. It could be better but my 1050 Ti handled it alright. About the multiplayer: I got disconnected only two times in my 25 - 30 hours of online play and that's due to inactivity. I never had issues with disconnects, but maybe I was lucky to play in general.

[b]Soundtrack is horrible! [/b]
Yes I get this one, but comparing to Heat where I liked only 2 - 3 songs, there are atleast 5 - 6 now which I enjoy for real and only 4 other songs which I skip instantly when I hear in Unbound. So yeah, the soundtrack is not that good but it's still an upgrade comparing to Heat.

Even though I countered most of the critical points of the game, I have to add that it's a bit disappoint to see the lack of tracks in the game, not even mentioning the long and grindy challenges to get cars in multiplayer. I also had troubles with the confusing UI in the multiplayer and the lack of replayability of the story mode, because after a playthrough you cannot replay it from scratch, except if you delete your save file, which also deletes your progression in the multiplayer. The game also lacks anything new to racing games, it uses the well known formula of open world racing games, which works but gives nothing new really in terms of gameplay.

In my opinion Need for Speed Unbound is a fun and challenging game if you into it, it also offers some fresh air with it's style and I can recommend to play it. 70€ is too much for this title, but getting it around 15€ is a good deal in my opinion.",1703531947,1703533118,True,74,4,0.70967942476272583,0,True,False,False

but even the police who seem to be more criminal than you between accidents that make senseless jumps on their own go the wrong way for no reason on the motorway like you're fleeing and you have a policeman in front of him for no reason even if you don't know you're there he does a 90 and it finds you, then a ford raptor that goes you've never seen 400 but here it does.
the game physics are indecent, the cars seem to be on a train track that don't lose grip, the drift physics are very ugly and pointless.
the plot is mediocre and the ending disappointing but this is my taste.
the dialogues that occur while you are running have no sense of existence, the opponents say random things that have nothing to do with what is happening.

The Bad: This is just an awful racing game. Controls are laggy and unresponsive, I feel like I'm driving through clam chowder. The ""drifting"" is just fake. I don't know how else to put it. If you've played any other racing game in the past two decades and drifted through a tight corner, you'll probably hate this game's idea of drifting. Lastly, the crashes. You either need to remove cops and traffic from the races, or let the player plow through crashes like they did in older NFS games, or you need to remove the weird auto-wreck/respawn system.

Handling has been garbage in these games since Ghost Games took over development of this franchise starting with NFS 2015, which unironically is a BETTER game than Unbound. Not even my grandfather's PT Cruiser handles as poorly as the[u] performance cars [/u]in this game do.

Here's a few more points I want to make:
-Soundtrack lacks diversity: It's all rap, which I personally do not like. Featuring that genre in itself isn't a bad thing, but the fact that there is NO WAY to filter it out or select any other genre is beyond stupid. This was a huge complaint many had with Heat (Also a better game than Unbound), and they doubled-down. Black Box allowed you to disable any song you wanted in their DIVERSE soundtracks. Hell, in Prostreet they made the same song in like 4 different genres (""More"" by Junkie XL)
-""Buy in"" Races: Phenomenal concept if it weren't for the piss-poor payouts. The point on buying into a race is that there's a lot of money to be won and it's a very high risk to take, if you lose you're out a ton of money, but in Unbound if you lose you simply don't win quite as much money. Buying into a $16K race will only profit you $6k...you can do other races that have no buy-ins and get $3k for winning. The ratio is way off, you're still winning money even if you nearly come in last place. Even if you're DEAD LAST, you only lose $3k in this specific race I mentioned.
-Visuals: The animated effects aren't nearly as bad or annoying as I thought they would be, but there's a weird lack of customization for those visuals. I had assumed that you could independently choose the colors, wings, and top icon, but you instead have to pick combinations of them and need to deal with random top icons, you can't set yourself to, say, have a crown show every time. This is not nearly as big of an issue as the other two, but I wanted to bring it up anyway.


This franchise has been in such a sorry state since Black Box stopped making the games, and I can barely justify buying this game at $10 during the 2023 Winter Sale; it's worth it, but only just.

Heat 3+ is just an exercise in pain. You are constantly being chased, yeah it's not that hard to get away but then what is the point?
The map doesn't default to centre on you when you open it so if you're in the lower part of the map you will need to move it literally everytime you open it. Is that a dealbreaker? No, it's just fucking annoying. 
EA, you have been making video games for fucking decades, get your shit together.

You know how in Forza you can kinda just chill out, upgrade some cars, test them out, have some fun? 
No, you can't do that. If you want to modify your car you need to end your session which advances a day towards the next event which means any time you want to test something you are losing a session, really not engaging. Want to just go for a cruise but you did one race this session? No, you have heat level 1 which means cops want to fucking murder you even when you're not speeding. Great fun.

Some of the songs are good but the music really just doesn't catch the Locale nore really the racing.

Overall driving feels unpredictable and lacks feedback. And without good driving it's not worth discussing any other points. Tho customisation is fun

I want to like this game but I don't. I don't think it's bad. When it's fun it's genuinely enjoyable. But when it's not it feels like a massive waste of time, and unfortunately the more I played the more it felt like I was wasting time.


[h2][Gameplay] “When do I clock in?”[/h2]
The game goes by a system where day and night are separate play sessions. Races come in point-to-point and circuit formats, takeovers and drift events are basically the same thing except one has breakable objects on track, pickups are events given by Tess, Rydell, and Jasmine during the story, and cop chases happen during and around all of these. So what's the problem? Well the car physics, the lack of event variety, the cops being more of a nuisance than a challenge most of the time, the day and night system, and the restart system.

The car physics aren't awful but sometimes the car will just do something unexpected and you'll crash and you will have no idea why it did. So you use one of your restarts which you have a limited amount of and if you run out you will either have to fail the night and you gain nothing.

The inability to tune cars while racing kind of sucks as the later you get in the game the less likely you are to have several cars tuned to spec. By the end of the Caspian the races feel quite formulaic, with the same events repeating.


[h2][Graphics] “Have you heard of jet set radio?”[/h2]
The game uses a mix of realistic vehicles and environments, and cell shading art characters. It looks alright but the contrast between the characters, cars, and environment is a little strange to witness. A new addition to the game comes in the form of effects for the cars when doing certain thing namely drifting, nitro, burnouts, and going airborne. They all work well enough but the lack of distinct options for these effects kind of sucks.


[h2][Sound] “*radioactive by imagine dragons*”[/h2]
The sound design is alright. The cars sound good and the system for editing car sounds carries over from the last game. The soundtrack is okay in terms of quality, it's just not fitting, it’s not very aggressive or fast or focused, it’s an improvement on Heat which was basically just Latin House, Trap, two drum & bass tracks, and a Denzel Curry song. Unbound on the other hand is mainly rap with a few other types of songs which means it’s still too slow but it’s at least slightly more racing related.

I don’t know why the soundtrack is like it is because if it’s appealing to teenagers why’s there no Phonk, no Breaks, no Metal, no Scream Rappers. It’s not in on whats popular with whatever demographic it's going for, and even then it’s still not very good by itself.

 
[h2][Story] “Why are you guys here?”[/h2]
The story follows a sort of revenge plot that the games doesn't seem very interested in following through with from the jump. The goal is to win the grand a new racing series held over 4 weeks that Jasmine (your rival for the story) is the face of popping back up 2 years after Rydell's rides got robbed with her being the only person who could have warned them of it. You win each qualifying, you win the grand, Jasmine comes back and some guy named Alec loses a lot of money, and Tess is there also.

The story isn’t awful but it’s not very compelling. Nothing really changes throughout the story, you don’t gain many friends, after the prologue the prologue you never lose another car, in the last week the game starts closing safehouses but by that point it doesn't matter. At the end of the story you’re basically at the same point you started but now you have at least a million dollars and a super cars, in a city you don't care much about because nothing you do seems to change it, racing against people you've had one conversation with tops.",1703214821,1703214821,True,2,0,0.506625890731811523,0,True,False,False

There is way too many bad design in decisions in this game that overshadows the good. 

1. God awful police system turning it into 90% of the time a game of cat and mouse with no rest for free roam enjoyment.

2. Customizing your car again after going out and winning some cash leads to advancing the time of day and available races.

3. The city just feels bland and so is the outskirts compared to NFS 2015's scenic map or even NFS Heat's city despite lacking in detail in many areas of that map. It's bad enough that they made the major urban area fairly small in comparison to older games.

4. Rival racers and rival cars variety is so few and is always the same on every race. It gets boring seeing the same cars with their riced out designs all the time. 

5. It was a bold move to use cartoon/comic-like elements to separate it from the crowd but I find it less appealing and jarring to see the longer time goes. Seeing those cartoony effects on cars while racing, it looks goofy or similar to a mobile game.

Some detail in review:

• [b]Cartoon Effects[/b] - Bold move for an art direction to set it apart from everything else in the market. This may or may not matter to some people. But I find it goofy and if they had to commit to one art direction, I think it has to be either full on realistic or full on comic-style or cartoon. It's jarring to see those goofy effects when the visuals of the cars and world lean toward the realistic. I wish these cartoonish graffiti would have just been applied on the UI similar to NFS Pro Street.

• [b]Art Direction[/b] - As a fan of NFS 2015's beautiful art direction when it comes to the world, atmosphere, points of interest in the map, and overall visuals. I was hoping they'd recreate that similar vibe here but no. NFS Heat, despite lacking in detail, the vibe & atmosphere there is closer in that regard. The detail in this game is a step up from NFS Heat though. 

• [b]Driving Physics[/b] - One of the game's strong points. The burst nitrous along side the traditional nitrous is a pretty good added feature. Rewards you for driving dangeroulsy and skillfuly with these burst nitrous that overtime if not used, will deplete. Think tactically when to use this. 

• [b] Cars [/b] - Singleplayer-wise, there's only a handful of new cars. Much of the roster exists from previous NFS titles. However they should have added more iconic ones like RX7 FC3S, Nissan S13 Club K's, Toyota Supra among a few. Though the Supra maybe a hard one since Toyota don't like to be associated with ""iLleGaL RaCiNG"" reasons.

• [b] Customization [/b] - 2nd strongpoint, the amount of customization is great in this game. A step up from NFS 2015 and maybe Heat. Except from some gaudy rim styles. Pizza style rims? Really?

I do hate that once you have some money won after a race, you can't customize your car back in the garage without having to advance through the day and have the game change the races do to this progression. Want to just change your paint, bumpers, or buy that nitrous for the next race within that time of day? Too bad, you'll bank your cash and advance to night time. Leaving all un-entered races behind. It is so limiting. It's bad enough that there's cops everywhere already limiting free roaming.

• [b] AI [/b] - AI rubberbanding sucks, there's always that one AI that is too far out or impossibly too agile or fast no matter what you do to catch up at normal to higher difficulty. If you ever played NFS Heat and encountered a similar situation, it's the same here. No difficulty is the right balance. Using easier difficulty, just makes races less of a challenge and you end up way too far ahead against AI. There's no middle ground.

Also, the rival AI racers you race against are always the same. A FEW are added when you progress through the game but seeing them all the time gets so boring. Even worse, most of their cars look like crap rice boxes. NFS Heat rival cars look better in comparison. It would have been great if there were more rivals. Seeing the same rival cars over and over again in every race gets boring. In the game, they said Lakeshore has a big underground racing scene. Yet it looks like a niche group seeing the same freaking rivals.

• [b] POLICE [/b] - GOD I HATE THE SYSTEM THEY'VE PUT IN THIS GAME. The cops are far less annoying to deal with than in heat's over the top police difficulty however, the problem starts when this game becomes SPLINTER CELL NFS VERSION. After a every race, your ""heat"" level will add up especially when mid to late game. So this makes heat levels 4+ too common. Free roam becomes a game of cat and mouse and there's no reason to enjoy cruising around or using the roads since there's cops & police helicopters spawning everywhere searching for you and a glitch where they spawn right in front of you out of thin air. This then makes cop chases all too frequent even if you're not looking for it or just want to go to a race meet up or cruise. ALSO, a few PURSUIT BREAKERS would have been great to be added back in a game having this much emphasis on cop chases. 

• [b]City & Open World[/b] - Lakeshore feels boring. It's not that there's a lack of detail but they somehow managed to make it less memorable or interesting. It just feels bland for some reason. Compared to NFS 2015 with a beautiful night city despite having no downtown to explore in. Maybe because the world doesn't have roaming AI racers or scattered well made points of interest and things to discover. You're always driving to the same meet up spots. I wish there were some events scattered around the map giving me a reason to explore certain areas. More things to do aside from just racing. 

• [b]Music[/b] - There are some good ones but what I hate about the music in this game is the lack of variety. I think there's too much rap songs and that they generally sound alike. There needs to be more variety in genre. 

• [b]Story[/b] - It's a bit better compared to previous titles. But this may be subjective. It has an annoying supporting character who won't shut up about boba tea balls and social media bs. But atleast it doesn't take itself too seriously and fall flat like Heat's story did.",1700905767,1703173113,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'd honestly put it to ""Not recommended"" just for that because it's been out for years and I don't think they'll fix that.

Worst part of it is it's random, I can have sessions where it's fine. I can not have it for minutes. But it'll ignore your inputs, I'd say often at the worse times, but a lot of races requires you to be in controls 100% of the time, there is no worse time, you always have to be ready and this thing mess up the whole flow and make you fight the game on top of fighting the cops, dodging incoming traffic and trying to outpace your opponents, which is a lot already, especially online.

It's in multiple threads on steam, on their forums and probably in other parts of the web. I've tried everything to fix it, I have a plugged controller. I've tried putting on another port. I've tried setting the priorities of the game higher. I've tried disabling the service they mention on their forums, I've tried updating my windows, which was the final straw because now the issue is even worse.

I edited the review to allow comment so if someday somehow this get fixed, you can call me out on that and I can try the game again. In the meantime, I'm done for the moment. It's a shame, and I sincerely hope for them that they fix it if not now, at least for the next one, but it's not like it's going to end their wallet if they don't fix their stuff I guess.

Old review below
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Need For Speed Unbound is not all wins,

I haven't played an NFS in 10 years. Blame Origin, couldn't be bothered to go there.

Unbound is a new direction: it has a mix of LA Gen Z douche culture, international hip-hop, anime and cartoon gfx, as well as a risk reward daily system. A lot of it is a welcome addition, bare some awful tracks.

I really liked the banter with the Rydell's, some of Yaz and Tess unhinged dialogues, the police roasting you when you're being chased. It's a shame that the main story last 4 in-game weeks and once you're done, you don't get to hear the other characters again.

The story is quite short, if you choose the coward way out like me and set it on relaxed, you'll get through the 4 weeks quite quickly, even if not all races are easy on relaxed. I kind of wish post game had higher reward races, winning car races, and more variety for every tier of races: you don't have much excuses to pull out your B or A rank car once your pass their respective weeks.

The controls are a mixed bag: some cars drive like a dream, some are more nervous, some are absolutely haunted (I love my dodge viper, but she does weird shit sometimes). The physics will make your car behave weird from time to time: the effect of rain is noticeable, but not really explained, some bump will make it twerk, reducing your control over it.

Also your car will jump around in very unrealistic ways from time to time, it'll just crash + barrel when it wants to, rather than when it should (if you played long enough you notice the bullcrap when it happens) 

There's 2 schools of driving: drifting and gripping. I'm a grip kind of guy and I'm glad you have the option to disable entirely the drifting shortcut when you just want to race and focus on taking turns as fast as possible.

Rivals are interesting, some nice details like how one of them won't gamble because they clearly look religious and it's against theirs to bet (but street racing isn't haram for her for some reasons)

Speaking of rivals, Shimizu is an absolutely overpowered opponent for a while, but after tweaking cars you realize he's beatable, but with that said, customization on the performance side leave room for clarity:
- Turbo are not really well explained, it either says ""Great at low speed"" or ""Great at high speed"" and it'd be good enough if you had 2 option, but there's like 5. I need to know what all 5 turbos do well, cause it change how a car behave, and by a LOT.
- Engines are bullsh*t. You don't need to buy them technically so it's fine, but you don't explain much here either. You see 5 lines like 0 to 100m or something, their horsepower and potential one, and not much else. 
You don't get the memo that if you buy an engine, you buy every single engine items once again. 
Which make the engines more expensive than 3/4 of the available cars.
You don't know how well they'll perform, it's kind of massive investment when you could just get a better car.

I missed having a game like that, and it might be why I've played it for dozen of hours after finishing it, even though there wasn't much reasons besides playing it. 

I love the customization options, I love how even though it's heavily reminiscing of NFS underground and most wanted, it's still its own entry with it's own pros and cons.

I don't entirely like the police, because 5 star can be more annoying than a challenge, especially when you lost them and they just re-spawn close enough to see you at the very last moment, or when helicopters are around.

And on some races, the ""speed"" or any S+ street races one mostly, it can be really cathartic to do clean races, but it's always near impossible when bystanders spawn block most of the road or shows up out of nowhere. Or worse when cops jump off cliffs to run right into your way.

To me, Unbound is a mixed bag. Many parts are really enjoyable, but the end package could have used some refining. I think it's a great buy in sales, but full price it might not be a competitive choice.

 Even after I gave it another chance, and got rid of the goofy multi-colored boost and tire smoke, it's still a terrible game.  The police AI is garbage.  they won't engage when you fly by them at 100+, you literally have to ram them to get their attention.  And even the very first race series forces you to save up a fairly large amount of money in one week or you lose.  So, your car has better be competitive or you lose.  You can't just make a car that is actually fun to drive (and your style), you need to have a car that will win first place.  I appreciate that to a degree, but when I just want to have fun, I don't feel like I can because I'm on a time limit.  Just let me have fun like FH5 and Motorfest allow me too.  And then I have to bring up the terrible cel shaded characters.  WTF?  These characters look stupid.  I don't know if it's because they look stupid, or if it's because of the extreme contrast to the fairly realistic looking vehicles, but this is a very poor aesthetic design.  And lastly, I need to mention how much I hate the characters and story.  I played for about 8 hours, and all of the people in this game seem like asshats.  I don't want to get a call from some dude who wants to tell me about how good the football team played last night.  This is just EA trying to be hip, but it comes across as corny and stupid.

One of the most striking features of Need for Speed Unbound is its highly responsive driving mechanics. The game excels in providing a smooth and engaging driving experience, making each race and chase feel exhilarating. Moreover, the customization options for vehicles are commendable. The ability to tailor cars to personal preferences not only adds depth to the gameplay but also allows players to connect more intimately with their virtual rides.

Art Style and Realism:
Initially, the game's art style seemed unconventional, but it grew on me as I progressed further. The blend of stylized graphics with elements of realism creates a unique visual experience. This fusion enhances the game's appeal, making it stand out in the crowded racing genre. The realistic aspects, which become more pronounced deeper into the game, add a layer of authenticity that seasoned gamers will appreciate.

Car Collection and Expansion:
Need for Speed Unbound boasts a solid lineup of cars, catering to various tastes and preferences. However, there's a feeling that the game could have pushed the envelope a bit further in terms of the variety and number of vehicles offered. Nevertheless, the continuous addition of new cars in subsequent updates shows the developers' commitment to keeping the game fresh and exciting.

Homage to Car Culture and Legacy:
As a car enthusiast, the subtle nods to previous entries in the Need for Speed series and popular car films are a delightful touch. These references not only pay homage to the rich history of the franchise but also to the wider car culture. This game skillfully balances respecting its roots while simultaneously carving out a new legacy, ensuring that it appeals to both long-time fans and newcomers to the series.

Conclusion:
""Need for Speed Unbound is more than just a racing game; it's a celebration of car culture and the series' storied history. The game strikes an impressive balance between exhilarating gameplay, artistic flair, and homage to its predecessors. It's a commendable entry in the ""Need for Speed"" series and a testament to the franchise's ongoing evolution.

This is basically NFS Heat with a more locked-down story line. There's a LOT of emphasis on the online aspect of the game... but it's basically an empty world. I've never found an available game with other people in it. That means you can't do any races, or unlock cars, since you can't race anyone. 

If you can pick this up for less than $15, it's amusing for a few hours. Otherwise? Skip it. $70-80 for this is an absolute joke.

The cars:
This is the SAME list of cars which they've been using since NFS Payback. They MIGHT have improved the models a little, but the number of truly ""new"" cars is minimal. 

The racing:
While I haven't completed the storyline yet (will update in time), I haven't seen a single offroad race. This means there's a bunch of off-road geared rigs/tires/etc., and no use for them whatsoever. Hopefully they show up later (I'll update my review if so). The racing is basically identical to Heat/Payback. Nothing new here, either. The ""Takeovers"" are the arena events from Payback.

The map:
It feels very VERY much like the map of Payback and Heat muddled together. Many of the tracks feel very familiar.",1702836713,1702836713,False,2,0,0.517946600914001465,0,True,False,False

THE AI RACERS ARE EXTREMELY ANNOYING. Their rubberbanding is so terrible, playing on easy difficulty doesn't help it either. They crash all the time and can drive away easily and traffic and corners doesn't slow them as much as you do.

THE POLICE ARE ALSO EXTREMELY ANNOYING. They spawn too much in free roam and F**ks you up during the race. They don't even target other racers, just you!

THERE'S NO BREATHING ROOM FOR YOU. To ensure win, you need to be constantly at full speed while having to dodge as many traffic, cop cars, walls and other obstacles as much as you can. All of this while hoping that your car doesn't lose traction and spin out. Slip up just once and other racers will immediately pass you!

While losing may sound pretty ok, like ""It's totally normal, you can always try again, move on..."" all that crap, but did I mention that you only have LIMITED RESTARTS and YOU WILL LOSE MONEY if you lose or leave the race???

For that reason, I never liked any of the newer NFS games. I also played the newer Most Wanted, Hot Pursuit, 2015 and Heat. I liked 2015 only for the customization, same with Heat. I didn't like the handling or the story of either. The way the camera functioned in Heat was very apalling to me, I could barely see anything in front of me when I was going fast.

I got Unbound, and I got the first new NFS title that I actually liked. I liked not only the graphics, but I liked how the game started treating itself as an arcadey-game, with the visuals. It's obviously not for everyone, but I really do like it. The handling is an improvement in my opinion, but maybe that's bias on my part. I don't actually know if there's a difference between Unbound and Heat regarding handling, but Unbound just.. feels better. Also, the nitrous - in Heat, all you had was pressing the nitrous button and getting a boost, depending on how big your NOS tank was, meaning you barely had control over how much you used. In Unbound, it's like NFS Underground nitrous, except if it fills, it doesn't fill a second layer. Instead, whenever you do something that would give you extra nitrous in Underground, it gives you burst nitrous in Unbound, whether your tank is full or not. Drafting, drifting, airtime, is burst nitrous, but driving in the opposite lane or just driving refills the normal tank.

The story - after the first week, I died of cringe and started playing only Online. It's actually alot more fun to me, despite there being lots of people who hit you off the road in order to get $3,000 more at the end of the race which is barely anything. Don't get me wrong, races give plenty of money (if you do a regular race playlist, it generally gives somewhere around 38,000 for first place, but if you have 2 people (you can't race alone) it will be something like 41,000 and it will only increase, as more racers join. In Online, there's also Linkups now, which are basically Unbound's style of car meets. You go into an area, and you do 4 rounds of activities, ranging from using nitrous, staying above 80mph, to destroying police cars. It's pretty fun, and you get quite a bit of money if you actually do things rather than sit around. You do get a heat level though, and you will have to evade, but for that, there's the next paragraph.

Then there's the police, a great improvement from Heat if you ask me. The dread that comes from being in a police chase is gone - now, you have a solid chance against the police, and it's not that easy to lose them, but it isn't hard to avoid being busted either. It feels like a fair fight, the gas stations now have a cooldown rather than limited usage, but I do admit, it is pretty funny to evade the police with exploiting their AI, the same way as you could in Heat. But a problem I have with the police in Unbound, is if you are even slightly within their search radius on the minimap while you're hiding, and you aren't seperated by a wall or a whole level, they will 100% guaranteed spot you and resume the chase. The game also doesn't hide spawning police right in front of you as you're escaping at 140mph, but I personally don't mind. It's just a skill issue on my part because I didn't bother leaving the area the chase was in. Also, in Online, after you evade a pursuit, it will reset your heat level to zero. It might be annoying to some, but I like it, it saves you the trouble of having to go to a garage, so you can get back into the action quicker.

The cars, I don't know what to say. I don't remember how many were in Heat, or how much you could customize them, but in Unbound I think it's pretty much the same. Custom horns, underglow, air suspension, and also the effects for drifting, using nitrous and jumping. I personally like them, because this way the game doesn't take itself too seriously, but it stays fun.

If you're looking for the classic NFS experience, but with Heat-like handling and performance tuning, I recommend this game. It gives me the same fun, although it's not the same style of game. If you're looking for a better Heat, I also recommend this game. I can't give exact reasons though, it just feels better to me, so think of it as bias if you'd like.",1702808920,1702808920,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Handling is worse, you now have limited restarts, car prices are high and race rewards are low, You are always in heat both night and day, they took out all options to reduce heat except swamping your car (Which at this time does not work), they only reset you heat when you loose a lot of money or the cops catch you, there is no reset button, and the story is a bad copy of most wanted. Only now they replaced the street bosses with generic stereotypical borderline racist stereotypes. Why should you play then? Th Need for speed driving style is still there and they make up for  the bad handling with yellow nos that helps you out in turns. Also, you do get side challenges and jobs that give you some cash. The car models and the tracks are cool  and the cop chases are still fun.

[h3]★★★★★ Customization[/h3] good, lots of different upgrades and changes for cars.

[h3]★★★Controls and gameplay[/h3] with a gamepad, excellent; with a keyboard, not so great. The opponents are worthy; it's hard to leave them behind, considering that the cars are roughly the same.

But it is not worth it if you give it a try. The restart system I also disliked at first but soon I simply started to accept 2-3 place and move on. AI is brutal at first for a newcomer like me. But the progression system made me drive better and still, I got some sweaty races even on relaxed difficulty. 
For the first time, I joined online NFS and it was fun. People there are either fully tuned or just refuse to compete but still, I had fun. The Linkups are fun and some races are also interesting to compete when the players are equally matched.
In the end, I spent around 40 hours in the story and 18 hours online trying almost everything the game has to offer.

the online is amazing . the sense of speed while doing speed races on highway feel really intense , anyone can crash out anytime and cutting through traffic in your car feels more satisfying and cooler than no hesi . the handling of cars i feel is really good , you can tweak it to be the way you want you can grip when necessary drift when necessary .

Linkups. man

they are amazing 8 - 10 people often are seen at linkups and man oh man does it feel good playing linkups . people come together and complete small tasks sometimes assisting each other and sometimes crashing into each other . cars flying cops stressing you chilling . you even get points when you are assisting others doing the tasks . After the linkup is over everyone runs away to evade cops its just really fun man . once i finished a linkup and was evading cops with another guy . that guy ran away and was in cool down , for fun i took the cops i had on my tail to him and he was back in chase , we both evaded later and he was holding a grudge against me , shit was hilarious . soundtrack may be mid but it suits the theme ( i listen to my own music).

I bought this game with my own money at full price with an enthusiastic yet open mind and found myself enjoying the first 12 hours of gameplay. Where the game went sour was when I ran into the second half of the game where S+ races are now available and proceeded to perform poorly on those races due to the unforgiving AI and the unforgiving environment compounding into a racing simulator where you would have to play perfectly to win.

This would be no issue if every race taught the player a different lesson and if the gameplay experience wasn't as loopy (and if the difficulty slider actually had a measurable effect), where I would be able to have each individual skill tested and then have to master those skills in order to move on to the next-- timing, reactions, pathing, risk-taking, and mechanics respectively.

However, this was not the experience. Instead, the final half of the game put each skill on high stress and expected the player to be able to overcome them individually. I have beaten each previous game from Most Wanted to (eventually) Heat on the highest difficulty on my Playstation 4 account and 2015 on my Steam account, a second time. This was the first game in the franchise I legitimately struggled on Easy mode and found myself consuming retries in waves on high-speed races.

The AI of the opposing drivers are too unforgiving at max speeds because most high-speed races take place on highways where one crash can mean you lose the entire race as the AI has a fixed reaction time and skillset, it doesn't need to react and can repeat applications unlike any human.

After I had beaten the game, I was looking forward to a satisfying ending to really highlight a hill at the end of the valley where the grass was greener on the other side. I wanted to see answers and the fruits of labour that I had put out to get to this very moment. In reality, I had a large happy slice in what was supposed to be the pie. Yes, I enjoyed the slice, but I didn't get the rest of what I paid for. 

Overall, it is clear to see that the developers had run out of resources towards the end, either due to a shortage of writers, time, or due to the Coronavirus Pandemic plaguing the beginning of this game, and EA as a studio was pressured into releasing NSF: UB to ""the biannual Need For Speed game"" to simply tide over the NSF community so that they could move onto the next project, which I would be more forgiving towards if I didn't complete the $60 game in 30 hours.

EA successfully brought plenty of content in terms of your favourite cars you can see on the street today, and managed to form-fit a beautiful, expressive art style that is both visually stunning and satisfying to experience into the game.

At the end of the day though? I can't justify a $60 game with a ""list"" of pros that consists of a single compound sentence.

I rate this game a 3/10 for the aforementioned pros and the aforementioned cons. This game does not live up to the title of a $60 experience and I would not encourage users to pay for this game if it is greater than $10.

If you do not care about price, very tough gameplay, or gameplay loops, and want to experience the full Need For Speed franchise and want to costumise your favourite car to your hearts content, look up and see if your favourite car is in the game (The Alpine A110 sadly was not, neither was the SSC Tuatara), watch some gameplay and read some other reviews, and THEN spend your money carefully.

My expectations for the story telling was absurdly low because to be honest NFS has never had very good storytelling so I was able to brush the absolutely abysmal dialogue aside. What I could not ignore however was this games absolutely atrocious handling model. This is especially apparent after just recently finishing a few of the Blackbox era NFS games prior to playing this one. It's really hard to explain but your car just kinda snaps in and out of a drift and everything just feels super stiff.

The game itself is fun. There's a bit of a story going on to give the whole thing a sense of direction, plus the cop chases can be quite challenging. The racing is about what we have come to expect from modern NFS games - its not fully physics based like the old games, but its not like the car is on rails like the games from the 2000s either. 

I'd say the weakest point here is the cars. For a game that came out in 2022, there are barely any new cars past 2018.

The car tier system encourages you to try out different cars and build your garage rather than focusing on just one. Customization is great here, although I didn't use it much (just not my thing). Unfortunately, AI is unreasonably difficult to the point of being unfair a good amount of the time. Cop chases happen way too often and are incredibly annoying at best and infuriating at worst. My biggest gripe is the super restrictive progression, at least for single-player. You can't really go at your own pace.

Btw I got this at 13.99, an absolute steal for a fun arcade racing experience. Here are some thoughts about the campaign (have not touched online yet):
- The qualifier system in the campaign can be a hit or miss. You need to accumulate enough money and car stats for the weekly grand race.
- The sense of progress feels way more rewarding than FH series. But it can be quite grindy sometimes to get a new car and fully upgrade it.
- Car roster is quite meh... 80% of them are from Heat. Way too many BMWs and Porches. The legendary Eclipse is back though. So that's a plus. 
- If you're turned off by the ""cartoon"" effect, you can completely turn that shit off now.
- Cops are not hard to escape, just plain annoying to avoid. Sometimes it feel like you're playing a stealth game just to get to a race. Remember, DON'T set a waypoint on the map. It will trigger the cop spawning on the way there.
- Customization is alright. But you can't swap parts between cars like in Heat. So spend money on upgrades wisely.

-After every race you get the damn heat and cops start chasing you (almost after every race) and you need to escape them to continue racing or continue in the story. 
-After racing in the day, the night becomes imposible, you cant drive anywhere without looking around for cops.
-Millitary jeeps (5heat/sheriff) driving 200+ in chase, bcs they need to be boosted and drive faster than you, is a clown joke.
-Nitro does nothing on the beginning, it looks like it boosts everybody not just you. 
-On every tier there is one racer that has a better car then you no mather what you do and it will be pain in the ass to be first, even on lowest difficulty (I am no pro racer just casual gamer, and it was very painfull).
-Cops during races are like a lotery, 50/50 they will crash into you or one of your oponents.. (very frustrating when you are winning the race and you get 3-5th place bcs one of them comes straight at you (same with npc cars))

- Car Game.
- Drifting mechanics is great.
- Uses DX12 > Allowing for much greater performance compared to its predecessor.
- Graphics.
- Very Fun.

Cons:
- 1 car dominating the entire S+ Class.

Whats Missing:
- Some of the great idea's from previous games have been forgotten about E.G Autosculpt, Actual downforce tuning, Weight reduction kits, Interior customisation.
- Final Drive Tuning.
- Drivetrain Swapping. (E.G FWD to RWD or AWD ect)
- More Online GameModes
- Gear Overrides with automatic (using LB, RB)

What Needs Fixing/Improving:
[u] {Performance} [/u]
- CPU performance degrades over time forcing you to restart the game. 
(Could be Windows, Ain't noticed it on Linux)
[u] {Audio} [/u]
- Garage audio bug, That when triggered causes a constant menu selection sound.
- Audio max volume is way off. Game is very quiet, Doesn't max out the sound card at the games loudest sound. [spoiler](thank god for libebur128)[/spoiler]
- Audio Mixing >  Player's car engine need a volume bump by 8-10%, The distance other players cars can be heard at also needs improving
- Advanced audio mixing The ability to control the volume of each sound that is audible.
- Car sound & effect sounds are linked to the same thing in the game engine (Turning down effects volume turns down player's car) & Other players cars is currently under effects volume not car volume.
[u] {Other} [/u]
- Max speed cap is currently set to 245MPH or the max speed for the Bugatti is incorrect?
- Car spinning wheel effects not aligned with wheels correctly.
(This is caused by antialiasing, Disabling it & using supersampling looks much better anyway.)
- Party Glitches (Online)
- Online feels empty. (Bump the player count to 24?)

Other Things That Could Improve The Experience:
- Seasons / Weather Changes, Including Snow & Ice. (Online)
- Dynamic Day/Night cycle (Online)
- Cops only give chase if aggravated, Isn't dynamic (Online)
- More online modes, things to do outside of races.
- Everything in ""What Needs Fixing"" & ""Whats Missing"".
- Allowing players to disable some of the extra effects. Trail lines are neat. Not really into the other effects.
- Zoom on wrap. Making it more easy to apply fine decals. (At the moment the only way is to leave the garage enter photo mode & zoom in that way)

Campaign Score: 5/10 
Online Score: 5/10
Overall 5/10

Has potential.

Is it the same 10 tracks recycled throughout the entire game, the cops' AI – truth be told, it's better than Heat but more ""annoying"" than challenging – the story, which was mediocre at best, or the graphics that are ""cute"" (possibly the only positive thing about this game) ?

I've invested so much time in this game that I can't even be bothered to write an in-depth review about it.

I'm guessing they did zero play testing as im gob smacked all these issues and more can be found out in 15 minutes of driving around.

Lot of complaints about the cops. The cops are fine, they're abundant, they now come at you during the day (as opposed to NFS Heat). If it was easier, then there would just be complaints of how you just go off a ramp or go off-road to lose em all and its boring (an earlier NFS game). 'Teleporting/cheating' cops, well yeah you're smashing around at 200mph in the later part of the game, something has to be done to keep it interesting. 

Slow money - as it should be. At first it seems like you'll never have any money to do anything cool but it feels more realistic/canon to what the game is about. You're starting from scratch and don't have money for parts and paint. You'll have plenty of money in the game when you need/want it just learn the game first.

Game gives you 4 retry's a day on normal difficulty which spans for the day and night cycle. I think it's great. Forces you to move forward even if it's a loss. It's a difficulty that again makes the game feel canon to street racing.

4 Weeks - I like that this game's story mode is 4 weeks and each day has different events leading up to the qualifier on the weekend. 'Feels' better.

NFS Heat 2.0 - a lot of complaints about the cars being the same and whatnot but there's more and just feels like they expanded on something great. Even old decals are back with a plethora of new ones.

My only gripe would be the repeating of levels. Sometimes it's a night variant, or you're now going up it instead of down it, maybe now it's a higher tier race meaning everyone's faster and flying off the rails, but it's the same race sometimes. The only thing I can maybe rebuttal with would be that it does help you get accustomed to the insane learning curve of how to drive the S+ 400+ tier McLaren's through the cities. So is it annoying? Yes but it's kind of like a forced learning where you just kind of have to hindsight the appreciation.

I'm 57hrs in atm, I have a few more days left before the 'Grand' race. I have a lot of collectibles collected and blew out the whole map of speed trap events but didn't seem to exhaust myself of anything (like NFS Heat felt).

Lastly, I picked the game up at 80% off (I think) so it was $15. I'm guessing I have another 10-15hrs left meaning like 70-ish hours of entertainment before maybe shelf-ing so I would say this game was absolutely worth it. $70?

This game can suddenly disconnect you from EA service without warning, preventing you from changing car parts, you have to quit and restart the game to fix this. Some of the cars sometimes are saved and loaded incorrectly, causing them to have visual bugs and nothing can fix them unless you sell the car and re-buy it. Selling bugged cars can also cause instability to the game systems and potentially corrupt your save file. The performance index system is trash, instead of going from 100-200, 200-300, etc., they opted for separating the classes in weird numbers like 210 is the start of A+ class.

On the multiplayer side, if you don't have friends, don't bother playing. Everyone is running the most meta cars, if you want to win, better start metaslaving. There's not much fun in multiplayer, you don't even actually race against other player, 90% of the time it's just you avoiding traffics and/or cops while the other players are pulling away to the finish line. At least everyone get big payouts so it doesn't hinder your progression too much. 

Speaking of progression, the multiplayer progression is trash. You don't have a lot of option for the first few cars you can buy and to unlock the rest you need to play a boat load of events. It's a very long and painful task, especially those that needs pole position, those are near impossible without friends as you have to use the meta cars, even then it's not a guaranteed win cause cops and traffic can and will mess up your pace. No matter how good you drive those corners, cops, civilians, and rammers will ruin your race. You cannot win against a car than can just accelerate away without using the booster mechanics in straights. Any race besides the S+ class are impossible to win without resorting to meta and most players in S+ class cannot drive their car without causing a massive car crash.

For a game that's supposed to be casual fun, this game is as sweaty as Forza Horizon ranked lobby.

[h2] Pros [/h2]

- Again there are many cars from different classes and brands to choose from. This time there is also a Bugatti Chiron, I think it's the first time they added one in a NFS game with customization. 
- Just like in real life, there is a fee in order to participate in most of the illegal street racing events. Which means that you can also lose money after completing a race. I know that NFS games aren't supposed to be realistic in general, but I think it is a nice detail which makes the game feel more like a real street racing game.
- Racing rivals are not generic anymore, and I don't mean the protagonists but all of the opponents. You can actually see the drivers before starting an event and there is a little description about each driver too.
- New customization options that can keep you busy for hours. Also, bodykits are back on the menu and some of them look pretty wild. Like, some cars can't be easily recognized with certain bodykits which is cool. You can now edit them too ( finally ). For those who played the older games (underground and most wanted) you probably remember having a bodykit but didn't really like the rear or front bumper and you couldn't change it? Now you can. There are also new neons, vinyls and more. As for the anime effects, I was also skeptical about this but honestly they add a nice touch to your ride. I feel like they actually compliment my car's wrap and appearance in general. You just gotta pick the right ones. You can also access hundreds of community made wraps by just pressing a button which is a really cool feature. Sure there are mods too, but sometimes you don't feel like browsing the interwebz and manually modifying files. So it makes things easier.
- New event types and playlists. Just like in Heat, you aren't forced to participate in all of them. I also like how there are events for all classes even when you are near the end of the story. Remember, there aren't only 1500+hp cars that participate in street racing.
- Graphics have been improved and optimized further. I don't know how, but this game has as good lighting, shadows and reflections as ray tracing without chopping your fps in half. The world textures and models look much better too. Speaking of the world, there are now pedestrians too which kinda brings the city to life. It's funny how they can dodge your car no matter how fast you drive (yes, I did try to kill some of them to see if it'll actually happen).

[h2] Things I disliked[/h2]

- Some of the mechanics and upgrades in the game encourage toxic ( in my opinion ) gameplay. Joining an online race to get smashed to pieces ain't fun. I love customizing my ride and racing with fellow gamers online, but the combat mechanics kinda ruin all that. I mean what's the point of spending time and money (not real money, in-game money) to make your dream car, only for it to get rammed? Of course you can quit without getting a penalty but the option to play like that is still there. The combat mechanics were great in NFS:Hot Pursuit, but it just doesn't fit in this one. Here is an idea - make some sequels for Hot Pursuit and put all the combat stuff in there ( and the police too  ).
- Police in single player can be pretty frustrating. If you're playing online your heat level disappears after the cops lose you, regardless if it's level 1 or 5. In single player however, it stays. Keep in mind, you cannot fast travel while playing single player but you can do so in an online lobby. So that means if you're done for the day and just wanna go back to your garage then good luck reaching there. First you have the mandatory post-race police chases even if you are sure that you drove fast enough to escape the police during the race, and then helicopters and cop cars appearing next to your location even if you aren't in a pursuit. Also, I don't know if this is a bug or not but police cars can spot you behind buildings too because you are in their "" spotting radious "" even if they are looking to the opposite side. So in other words it's like playing a stealth game while driving a car. 
- Single player progress is not shared with online, which may not sound too bad but here is the thing : Cars in multiplayer are unlocked differently. For example to unlock certain cars you must do 30 races of a specific category. I don't wanna bash too much but this game came out last year and has only about 2.000 players online on a Sunday after going on a deep discount. It may sound like a lot of players but not all of them are playing online. And many of those who do don't join in all of the events.
- There is a "" speech focus mode "" option which is always on even if you turn it off. So the option doesn't really work. As soon as a character is starting to talk you only hear him/her even if you adjust the speech volume to be really low. Speaking of speech, there is a lot of unnecessary, nonsensial, annoying and cringy dialogue that the players don't want to hear. It made me completely mute the speech. I mean it's not like I missed any important detail. 
- The music is good but there is no variety in genres. I'm not a big fan of pop and rap music, especially while being in a S+ race. Put some rock and metal.

[h3] Other [/h3]

I think releasing so much DLC for a game with "" Mixed "" score and low player count isn't a good idea. But hey at least it is only cosmetic stuff and you aren't really missing anything if you don't buy them. Still, it is wasted time and money for the developers. I would rather work on improving the game's mechanics first. You can see many negative reviews that mention the problem with the police being too OP. Gonna type the suggestion again : Remove combat mechanics and police from NFS games that focus on customizing and racing. And if you wanna add them then put them in a Hot Pursuit sequel. No one will probably read this but whatever.",1701625722,1701625722,True,148,1,0.886549055576324463,0,True,False,False

I have not had any real issues in evading police, they are very similar to Heats police system but easier to avoid. In heat if you are in their line of sight, they are chasing you immediately. In this you have an opportuniy to have them try to figure out who you are first before they actually chase, and most times it takes them way to long to figure that out. The map is fantastic as well. As someone who has been to Chicago, it is crazy seeing places I have been to. Very detailed. The animations are goofy as hell, but still fun. I don't get the hate personally. 

I will say this is certainly no Most Wanted, but Unbound and Heat have their own styles that alot of racing games don't even attempt and I respect them for doing something different.",1701625683,1701625683,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Graphics are good, the visual style works well despite what the haters will say. Gameplay is pretty unique and is fun to master, though the physics get a bit annoying sometimes (like driving on curbs makes you lose all controls, it's an arcade racing game, not a sim, why is this a thing?). The soundtrack is fine as long as you're not a close minded ""muh rock music"" person/someone whose personality is solely based on hating on rap and hip-hop in general. The campaign has a good structure on paper but loses traction at the halfway mark, and lacks a meaningful endgame. 
Multiplayer is fun, bar the occasional rammers and meta cars spammers who will act pissy if you show them actual skills. Linkups are a very fun and creative way to make players gather into a coop experience, where everyone gets to reap the benefits, I hope other games in the genre will take inspiration from it.

At the end of the day this game is a solid 13/20, as in it's has its good moments, but some aspects hold it back significantly. Also in the arcade racing game landscape, the overall design of NFS Unbound feels dated, you could play a 10 year old game from this franchise and aside from graphics being worse and maybe gameplay too (depending on which) you're largely going to play the same thing. On top of that, everytime there's an update, the subsequent lack of communication from the devs makes it seem like it's the end of the post-launch support.

No problems or fps hiccups. Runs smoothly on I7 10700 and GTX 1660Ti combo.
Liked the new effects too, they add a bit of fresh air to the game. Controls are a bit scuffed, sometimes you can't go into drift simply by releasing the gas and holding it again.
Or pressing a break will throw your car in no understandable vector of movement.
Music is meh, heat had something better to offer. I have some songs from NFS:Heat in my spotify, however I'm yet to find something decent in Unbound.

In 2023, how can EA make a car racing game TERRIBLE?  I'll give you an answer:  Say its steering wheel compatible and make it brutally frustrating to use.  I was SUPER excited to put some play time into this, and its entirely unplayable on PC with my logitech G29 wheel. 

You MUST use the controller style inputs, and not use a mouse for navigating menus.  How hard is it to retain mouse functionality when you put a game on the steam store?

None of the inputs match what the wheel is labelled as from default (X is NOT the ""playstation"" X on my wheel). 
 
There is next to no customisation allowed for using a wheel.  As in you cannot adjust or even see that there is a wheel acknowledged in the game.

Would not recognise my ""e brake"" controller for use.  

Does not recognise clutch functionality.  

The sensitivity is so low the cars only go straight without a full (or more) turn of the wheel, WITH NO WAY TO CHANGE IT.

Not to mention the whole ""do sketchy things to refill your NOS"".  NOS is a bottle of pressurised gas.  Once you're out, you're out.  I could see if on a turbocharged engine you have temporary extra boost, but this is massively stupid.

Got frustrated after 27 minutes and I don't even care if i get my money back or not.  This is absolutely un-excusable in this day and age.  And the price??  $90 canadian pesos and it's absolute junk.  Id be livid if i didn't get it for $29  on sale.  I'm upset as it is.

Can we stop with trying to be ""street savy"" and maybe just make a good game again?  Maybe just update hot pursuit 2.  Or maybe, just MAYBE, MAKE A CAR RACING GAME THAT ALLOWS THE EASY USE OF A STEERING WHEEL.  ITS NOT LIKE STEERING WHEELS FOR PC'S AND CONSOLES HAVEN'T ALREADY BEEN AROUND FOR 20+ YEARS.

Things I like:
- Races are fun, interesting courses
- Car selection
- Car customization
- Finally a story that's not completely corny, it was actually a great story
- The animated effects are fun to pair with your car design, also I'm a graphic artist myself so I'm into that stuff
- The music is cool for the garage but in action it leans more towards eccentric movie scene than epic blistering high speed race. The game is called Need for Speed, but the race music sounds like it belongs in a sexy spy thriller or something. What I will say is that I am amazed they included a lot of Polish artists, as the Chicago area has a massive Polish population in real life so it is a nice tribute. Otherwise, yeah just turn on Spotify and use your phone as a remote.

Things I don't like:
- Cops will literally pop out from nowhere so you can t-bone them. I raced my ass off and made it to the last 100 feet of the finish line only for an SUV to stick it's nose in my face and make me lose. The cops are really punchable sometimes. They're supposed to be challenging, not cheap.
- The countdown at the end of a race when one person wins. No matter what the class, all it takes is one player with a maxed out car (usually a Lambo) to beat everyone to the finish line by like a whole minute or whatever and the race is ruined. More than once I have seen a whole entire grid not make it to the end because one guy with ""BYE"" for a license plate practically teleported. This either needs to go or have the time increased. 
- In the wrap editor, they got rid of some of the transparency/gloss options for full-color graphics like there was in Heat. Only color-pickable vinyl pieces have metallic as an option. Bummer. 
- In Single player, the day thing is cool but I don't like having only one shot at an event, plus the limited restart thing is lame. I understand the ideology, but it's either an arcade racer or it's not. Pick a lane.
- I worked hard to unlock and buy my favorite cars only to learn that not only don't they transfer to online mode, they're even harder to unlock there. In fact, I can't unlock a Corvette ZR1 without playing [losing] 20 - TWENTY! - races ""in a Chevrolet"" in just one car class. This would normally be fine except the only pre-unlocked chevrolet is... none! At least not stock. You have to use a ""rental"" C7 Grand Sport with low stats (it's actually a fair mid-range but you only ever stand a chance against other rental car players), and your only other option is the custom '55 Bel Air you have to downgrade to use in A+. The result is a hyper-grindy experience that's more infuriating than anything else. The silver lining is that at least 7 races in I can finally drive a C6 Corvette (7 is a more reasonable number than TWENTY wtf), but still. It makes me wonder how many other unlockable cars are like that.  
- When I was driving my [nerfed] '55 Bel Air I couldn't avoid traffic AT ALL. The only way to nerf it was to make it an off-road vehicle, and while I understand they're not good on tarmac, you can't convince me the thing would seriously take fifteen whole seconds to get moving. 
- No grip at the start unless you hit the boost at exactly the right spot. A grippy start is the only way not to lose a race sometimes. Can we not pretend like these video game characters don't know how to drive a race car?

Things I wish:
- The original soundtrack from Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. Just kidding. It was awesome but there's a lot of cringe adult lyics that wouldn't fly today lol. but Bush was in there for some reason so it was awesome. Maybe 2005 Most Wanted's soundtrack instead. Okay okay here's the real wishes:
- I wish in single player I could play the same race more than once every day of the ""week"". I loved practicing Discovery race in Heat so I could get good at it, now I can't do that. I don't even remember the races because the names and the categories sound equally theme-like
- I wish it was easier to find a race you liked. The one that ended with the drain pipe race was kickass. They get lost inside playlists and the categories get confused with the race names and all I want is a list of Endurance races and where to find them. Except it's not just Endurance races; EA did the intelligent thing and separated the long ones from the short ones where one is called Endurance and one is called Street Race and one is called Corner King, which imo is highly subjective. And that's cool but without a list or directory it's hard to find your favorite one. I just want to know which race is the longest one in the game, like Discovery in Heat
- I wish there was a hidden train tunnel that takes you across the map like in Heat. Unless there is one and I haven't found it yet. The train tracks in the south don't lead anywhere.
- I wish there were off-road races. The only use for off-road parts at the moment is easier time evading police. Otherwise they're useless. Racing against other players just means hoping there's grass along the course. See my '55 Bel Air dilemma above. Off-road cars are sometimes un-driveable in normal race conditions. The off-road races in Heat were cool. A future volume that is dirt-themed would be really cool. There's a whole ski-jump ramp course in the north just WAITING to be used for something. One part of the map is called the ski resort on the police radio. Who doesn't wanna race in a ski resort?! The Subaru WRX, Focus RS and Lancer Evo are just screaming for dedicated courses.
- More transparency options for full-color decals
- Hoonigan / kb43ver decals (I made some myself but still)
- color-theme picker for certain tags. Like, a special unlocked tag comes with a white or black setting
- A Porsche, a Lambo and a Ferrari all walk into a bar, they order drinks for the rest of the grid, except the rest of the grid quit and went home when they all got DNFs three times in a row and didn't get to see their track time. What a joke! Ditch or drastically extend the end-of-race countdown timer. Or keep the timer and have the punishment be less XP and cash. Or, if not making players wait for their opponents to finish is what you're worried about, trigger a heat level 5 on the front runner to hound them and slow them down if they have too big a gap. All these players hating on the police will start rooting for them if it means they're battling your OP front runner for you. Or just make Class S+ requirements way more stringent in the first place so I don't learn the hard way that putting the biggest engine and maxing out my Corvette C6 is not worth it.

Having police around 24/7 in a street racing game just kind of ruins it. It is so tedious to escape that sometimes its not worth it, and i just alt+f4. i spend 10 minutes trying to get to a safe house to almost pull in just for another cop chase to start. Cant drive anywhere or do anything without a 20 minute long police chase starting. And just when you thought you got away, WRONG!

The graphics are hideous, especially these drawn on effects and cartoon characters. I don't ever remember playing need for speed and thinking, ""you know what, why not add fortnite characters"" and I'm sure you didn't either, but that's what we got. I wish there was a way to turn those stupid driving effects off entirely. I'm pretty sure this game was designed for my generation (I'm gen Z) but the dialogue I've heard so far comes off forced and is super cringey. Drift mechanics also seem much different from prior games. I definitely wouldn't recommend to others unless it's on a really good sale (80% off or more). I will update the review as I play more, but initial opinion is thumbs down.

Update: After having played for several more hours, I figured I'd update my review. The prologue is easily the worst part of the game so far, if you can stomach that, and move on to the actual game, it becomes way more fun. I went ahead and installed reshade to remove the crappy effects I hated and it made the game much more enjoyable and easy on the eyes for me (EA please don't ban me). Dialogue is still pretty cringe though. Also, it seems like there's not enough money to go around in the game to buy multiple cars for the campaign, and I still haven't even gotten to customize my car's appearance since I bought it (it's been nearly a week in game time and I've played nearly every side quest that was available to me and spent time doing several collectibles for 250 a pop), which kinda sucks but it's not the end of the world. I will say now that the worst of it is over, I can recommend it to others, however, still not at full price.

THE GOOD 
-Story is actually good... surprisingly... Racing games are known for having pretty trash stories but this one is decent. I found myself invested.
-The races are fun and chaotic
-The cars are GORGEOUS 
-Music is good

THE BAD
- Single player and online are now separate. I can no longer drive around and see other players sweet rides while I head on to my next story mission. If I want to see other players at all, I have to go to Freeroam/PvP. Somehow that just kinda removes some of the magic. 
- Game has glitches that can and in my case, have ruined races. I have had cars appear in front of me mid race, my car crash on thin air like it hit a wall, My car under preform like mods I installed didn't take only to return to normal after a loading screen, ect... It all feels very EA GAMES unpolished. 
- Police can turn on a dime during a chase. I have watched them rubberband to me when I was escaping too, which is FRUSTRATING to say the least. 
- The new art style feels weird. Your characters are stylized in a cartoonish way while the cars look life like. It sometimes looks cool, but mostly clashes with the environment. I don't hate it, but I can see how it would cause some design whiplash for people. 
- You can't restart your save game. If you want to go back and start over, you can't. This feels like it should be a basic feature and excluding it baffles me. 
- The story has a week by week set up that seems fun at first, but as time goes on I feel like I am spending too much money on the story beats and race buy-ins and not enough on my car. My first week I spent all my time just upgrading my car and the grange just so I could keep up with the competition. So I couldn't customize my car, which is a cornerstone of these types of games. 
- Races are fun, but they feel like BS sometimes. You will watch the AI in front of you crash, and get behind you, only to catch up again within a few moments. How can they rebuild their speed so fast when they crash? Speaking of which...
- The AI crashes during some races like they don't know how to make it around specific turns. 
- EA LAUNCHER 

I can't say if they will make another NFS. I hope so... but this missed the mark. And with EA GAMES trying to spear head the $70 for games that are blatantly unfinished and short on content, its likely NFS is going down the drain.

For the most part, Unbound is just the previous game Heat. I have put at least 50 hours into Unbound and tried liking it but for several reasons it just does not stick with me. On the positive note, Unbound continues to allow players to choose there character and customize them from head to toe. There is a huge category of cars to choose from. They did not skimp out on choices so feel free to browse and find your ride. The story is somewhat charming in certain ways. Some of the characters have quite the humor and makes you either like them or hate them but I will leave that for the last. The cops in this game are BRUTAL! So expect to receive a challenging fight on the road after racing. I mean who expects any chase to be easy. Its not impossible to escape but risky and sweaty. Earning cash is not easy and requires making rational choices to race events with high heat or opting out for a small bank, so the challenge of making choices is quite steep. 

Now for the negative side of this review. The story and writing sucks. Basically your best friend is a total player and a low life selfish jerk and screws you over a bunch of hot cars and joins a gang to rule over the city as the most notorious infamous street racers. Oh did i forget to mention that politics and street racing have something in common ""Hypocrites"". The political members are involved in corruption and completely insane. No joke its Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden arguing. Cops are some how super evil and senseless. While I get street racing is illegal the writers make it look like its all rainbows and flowers and everything is OK. Basically trying to make it look good and cops are bad? The music.... don't get me started. I am not a daily rap listener, more like hard rock and metal but I know it when I hear sick beats and the song choices in Unbound are sickening. Like who chose this playlist? I am a big 90s guys and I ""personally"" wish there was a balance in the choices of cars. The most iconic and popular vehicles are not included. Like where is my AE86?

The handling is a bit better than Heat but still bad ... sometimes cars have a mind of their own and turn non-logically. 
I like that they experimented with the cartoon artstyle and I only wish they did more of it, not only the tire smoke and characters.
Customization is awesome and community wraps are the best thing to happen in modern nfs so I am glad they are continuing it.

But the game is the embodiment of repetition. Its divided into 4 qualifiers and qualifiers end with a big triple race with nothing different. Each qualifier you are doing the same races against the same opponents and after almost every race theres a tedious cop chase which wouldnt be bad, but the cop chases are so BORING in this game. You have no tools to end the chase earlier or to use against them, ramming them does more damage to you than them and most of the time they are faster than you so usually they will just drive around you like an annoying mosquito.
There isnt even a real danger because you will run away from them eventually since the chases are not hard so they are there only to waste your time after race. Also it seems like cops sometimes see through a wall and spot you even though they shouldnt.

The soundtrack is horrible apart from a few songs. Story is mostly non-exsting apart from like a few cutscenes. I lowered the dialogue volume halfway through the game because is was just yapping about nothing with a sprinkle of cringe here and there.
Also you have to grind in a single player game if you want to try the most expensive cars? Why? Why not unlock them after you finish the story since the money doesnt matter anymore anyway?
Also the map is extremely boring with only memorable parts being the Porsche building and ski jump. Apart from that the layout is pretty much the same to the one in Heat .

Only real fun I had was like half an hour before the end of the game when I got my hands on a really fast car and started skipping most of the stuff to finish as quickly as possible. Last race is kind of fun also when you get to use all the cars you got so far in the game.

NFS Unbound is basically reskinned Heat with Anime Style effect,which did bother me for the first hour,longer you play it u feel more and more focused on the road rather than the effect,the effect did give some nice info for burst nitro so u didnt need to focus on HUD for long

Handling feels.......... weird,i do like the grip mechanic but sometimes the physic is confused for a sec, on some corners u need to half throttle for some cars so it doesnt slide out when cornering,if you do tapping the gas there is like having a chance your car will do drift,or readjust your angle when u turning in grip car,it just weird

sadly Unbound is more online focused than story mode,so i recommend buying this on discount,like Heat 90% discount (i think) if u only want to play the story mode or if u want to use a mod

good concept in term of gameplay and game design. but still lack of story and writing, dude even A$AP speech in the credits is more longer than the actual story. plus, they just reducing the racing variety stuff, kinda miss the drag race kind of type. on the customization side, it has lot's of improvement, they gave more freedom on decals, visuals and stuff. i'm not recommending this if you only wanted the singleplayer campaign, this game only have about 10-15 hours playtime.",1701332062,1701332062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In fact, this firmware works for all NFS except for Need for Speed (2015) and Rivals.  I didnt check Payback.

Also, if you get the ""No Access to game"" message:

Reinstall without doing any other network activity during the installation process (no web browsing, no email checks, no nothing.  It hard not touching my computer for 10-mins.).  That worked!!  The game loaded.

I hope this works for everyone else.

I believe this is a steam issue when downloading/installing.  Dying Light 2 would not load after installing in the background.  But when I reinstalled, it worked.

Game play is more of the same from previous iterations.  The graphics are more Anime style.  It's not for me but different.  I don't mind developers taking risks.  It does not effect game play. 

If you like the previous NFS's you'll like this one.  If you didnt like them...oh well.

And keep in mind, before playing it I tried avoiding watching to many Videos of it on Youtube. But what I was hyped about it was the fact that you can get special Body kits for your cars and because of that I was hopping in NFS unbound I would able to make the 69 Charger into the Daytona version which is my dream car. But instead they made like a G wagon version of the charger with a blower on it, I mean why? Who in the world is going to be wanting that? And what I also hate about it is depending on how upgraded your car is, you then cant play on the lower tier events with your high tier car like you can do in the other NFS games which is what makes Unbound more harder to play. The Fact how your Car Crashes, Even on Easy mode the Ai racers are hard which makes this game to hard to complete, and the multiplayer is also bad since if you don't have a low tier car it will force you to drive a rental Car which makes it hard to race real players.

Game does enjoyable with moments of frustrations. You purchase that game to feel special, a dominant as a racer... BUT NOW - THINGS HAPPENS...
Cons: 
* AI quite overpowered even at ""peaceful"" (easiest difficulty).
* One cornering mistake makes you loose few position, even worse if you crush.
* Drifting and Drift Evens are horrible... (Managed to beat very first,  STORY-progression drifting event only at 4th attempt (yes its that BAD).
* Even cheating with infinity nitro - AI manages rocket pass you from behind.
Pros:
* Quite large amount of car to select form. Missing some big manufacturers like Audi's, Lotus, Alpha Romeo, Peugeot, McLaren(?), Bugatti and few more.
* Quite big list of parts to shape up your dream car's body.
* Slightly confusing UI but with full freedom of creating car's unique style (Body wraps / Body art).  
* Rebuilding/Editing performance of your favorite car. Even old GOLF ca be upgraded up to top tire class.
* Dirty, fancy, inspiring beats, leading you all around. Indeed keeping your blood boiling during toe-to-toe racing events.

It's better game play wise and just a better rated game. You also don't have to buy DLC to get the cools cars like the BMW M3 GTR or SKYLINE from underground 1/2. Out side the F1 car. Trust me.

UPDATE: (11/8/2023) -- DONT GET EA-PLAY --
 Short answer: DONT BUY THIS GAME OR EA-PLAY! If you have EA-Play, spend money on the cars you got from EA-Play, and stop paying for it... They take all the cars and the money you spent on said cars. EA is so damn money hungry.

The story is 100% IDC, due to it being VERY boring, the progression is meh, and the cops are non-stop before and after a race. Cops are all you get in this game. Also some cool cars show up. The cops and the bad story is the main issue. They spawn on top of you, half the game you cannot out run them (Unless you just drive on the high way) till you get a car up to A+ rank and even then, the spam is ridiculous. You can get away in the beginning, so long as you have some know how but meh. As soon as i leave the safe house, cop chase. They will just spawn on top of you and its dumb. I get in heat we said ""TO EASY"" but this is not even hard. Just annoying. The cops are not even smart or good. All you did was throw numbers at the players and boy are they way to much. The cars and driving it's self are okay. But thats about it for me. The grind makes me want a refund but sadly, i have played it more than 2 hours. In short... If you have ""Need For Speed: Heat'... Stay on it. I'm coming from all the old NFS and this is just bleh. You'll see me in heatXD

I just hope it gets full offline support on PC so I can continue to play this after a decade or so when it is no longer supported. 

I'd also love to see them tweak the crash camera system so we don't just go flying when hitting traffic. Let us tank some of those like we can tank hitting the cops.

New game+ would be a great addition as well. They could add more cars, more body kits, cool liveries, driving effects, sounds, more collectibles etc. for us to earn. Big rewards like 'legendary customs' body kits could be the end of week rewards similar to how it was in the story.

Great job, Criterion. I hope you continue with this art style and aesthetic in future games. If not, I hope you make something just as cool!

However, I decided to give the game a try on gamepass and despite my initial impressions, I like the game. The story is a lot better than NFS:Heat and the effects don't pop up *that* much and I've gotten used to them. The story is so much better and characters are more personable too. 

 They've made some changes from heat following Forza's footstep, but in the right direction. I do not like Forza's driving, but they took the same car rating races and makes the races feel a lot better. In heat, you could join recommended 100+ rating races with a 300+ car and it wouldn't even feel like a race. In this, every car has a B/A/S rank depending on the car and upgrades. You will not be able to race in a B rank race with an S rank car. I love this. It actually makes pretty much all the races feel worthwhile. 

The only downside to this is the money earned so far in the story mode is pretty abysmal. I don't know if this will be increased later, but when you're earning 5 - 10k/race and upgrades can cost anywhere between 50-100s, it sure takes a lot of grinding and there's a limited number of races per day. Hopefully later in the story there will be higher payouts. 

Online and Story mode are split. It's an odd change, but I'm here for it so far. I wish the character you create would at least transfer over as it requires you to remake a character for online, but that's alright.",1701102615,1701102615,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Terrible game 4/10 The way they handle money in this game is pure garbage.  If you don't pick optimal cars and do the right races then you wont be able to beat the game. Game should reward you for doing more races other than trying to stop you at every point with expensive pay ups for races. If you have a bad car then this game's problems just get even worse as you are not able to get enough money to upgrade it as you wont be winning races and if you try to go to older cars then you will just be making pennies. The same applies that if you aren't winning the race then the race is pretty much lost, I could go on and list more problems but thinking about this game is just gonna make me more angry,

PRO:
+ Great racing experience
+ Well designed environment, with beautiful graphics
+ Art style is actually new! They tried something novel, so kudos for it. Doesn't really affect anything, and can be a bit distracting at times. But looks fun, and was worth a shot.
+ Good physics and handling. Drifting although a little tougher, is quite satisfying. I like the increased difficulty. And I also like the Drift or Brake style drive options. Nice tuning choices too (kept it simple). 
+ Great car selection (nearly same as NFS Heat) 
+ Good variety in cop AI. Different kinds of cops with different driving styles, strengths and weaknesses. 

CON:
- Story is absolute s***. I don't feel invested, nor do they let me have enough time to build a relationship with any character before the backstabbing begins. So I don't really care about anything that happens after. I like a good story, and this wasn't it. 
- The cops are actually good and beatable, but maybe a little too soft. They don't really terrify you even at heat 5. It's just really annoying at night trying to avoid them, while going from race to race. So they are just an inconvenience really. 
- The races per day/night cycle are limited, also you cannot replay them. WHY ?. So when you are out of races, the game kinda says, uhhhh times over?! go back to day --> Its like they are telling me how to play the game. Its like a parent running a schedule on your life. WHY ?
- The replay-ability and post campaign game is non-existent. You win the grand, and that's it. You can grind another two weeks to the next grand. But its just so boring. 
- Too few difficulty levels. Even on max difficulty. Its too boring. Why not just add a few more levels in between and after like Forza. 
- The money is a grind. It takes too long to earn a buck, and it gets spent really fast. So the first 2 weeks are super tough and you can barely scrounge a dollar for parts. But the next two weeks are too easy and you are forced to play through multiple days despite having enough money for the full upgraded car, garage and entry fee for the tournament. This needs to be re-balanced. Also, the money should be much easier to earn after the campaign so that we can try out different cars and replay the races differently. But no, its still a grind to buy new cars and upgrade them. 
- The car upgrades are really expensive and the parts are no longer exchangeable. Sure, its more realistic. But nothing else in this game is realistic. NFS heat had exchangeable parts and engines, and this saves so much grinding, especially for the later and post-game.

FIX:
+ (The NFS day/night reward cycle was much more high stakes. You could repeat races. You could pick which period you wanted to play, for how long you wanted to play, and how ever many times you wanted to play it. The cops were tougher. The money was more manageable. Just paste NFS heat onto this game map and fix all the issues!)",1701055711,1701055711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are very nice but it's a mixture of two very different styles that are not balanced very well and it seems that the second style which is less shown is the cartoony one that was added at the end of development or was somewhat scrapped early on. Overall, they kind of blend fine since the colourful effects add to the dull world. The weather effects are mostly gloomy and rainy and it never goes to a more harsh weather which is disappointing. There is day and night during gameplay and they are separate, but is a very nice touch to have them both.

Sound is good as it makes everything sing in their own way especially if you listen without the music. Music is not very good as there is no variety and it gets boring fast, although i do enjoy a couple of the songs.

Story is forgettable and nothing much happens. The characters are bland and the dialogue can go from kind of funny to pretty bad and even annoying. The ending is OK and generic. 

Gameplay can be quite fun. The map is good in size but the lack of variety in races and places around the map makes it feel small and reused which in return makes races and chases feel like they are too long or short most of the time. If you don't know what you're doing the game can take a while to beat as you can get stuck due to needing more cash or losing it to the police since you don't have a good enough car or you don't have cars in all the classes which are five of them. The police is not that challenging but can be annoying, you don't really have to do police chases to progress but the rank goes up by doing races and they will be roaming around a lot and even start going after you during a race and they do give you a bit of cash. The game has three difficulties and while i played on the medium for half of it, i eventually put it on easy as it got very annoying for me due to mostly the police. It can be very fun during a race while everyone is being chased and can get chaotic even more when the police rank gets higher especially at the highest which is 5. Even on easy the racing can be challenging. As far as i can tell, rubberbanding is a bit here and there but the AI does fall behind and crash, which is nicely balanced in a way. The car upgrades are great, although i don't like the idea of buying each stage of car parts and then pay for each of those parts again. There is a nice variety of customisation which doesn't get boring even after you finish the game and just play online with others. Sometimes you get offers to drive around cars to their destination for money or escape cops which is a nice change from the usual races. Cutscenes are poor but colourful i guess. The speed feels amazing, especially later on and the extra NOS mechanic is quite enjoyable. There are a good amount of cars, but instead of putting more nice or cool ones, they put some old miserable ones.

Multiplayer is nice, but it's completely separate from the Single player/Story mode which makes you get money and cars all over again.

Some minor things that i have and really made the experience worse for me:
 -there is no fast travel across the map in the Main Story which by design is understandable as you have to deal more with the police even though the chases don't give you anything to make you do them, but sometimes a police car just spawns right in front of you and it starts chasing you without even having the time to escape the radar.
 -you can go to any garage to escape from the police but you have to be very specific where you stand to actually enter it or else you need to move around and police can start chasing you again and it happens when you go to a race location as well where you have to enter inside the garage and not just start which can be again frustrating especially in a police chase.
-there is absolutely nothing interesting on the map, except for one location that has a great view of the entire city; It's quite average at best.
-there are people walking around which is a nice touch and makes the city more alive but when you drive at high speeds they don't move out of the way fast enough and you just run over them which made them less enjoyable for me.
-no connection between the story and online multiplayer is just kind of stupid and made me not play it anymore.
-during the game, a lot of times you get calls from your friends who never shut up and the dialogue makes it even worse even during races and there is no option to shut them up for good or at least outside of the main plot dialogue. 
-not enough options for races and of course the police just being there to annoy you.
-the day and night being separate eventually became somewhat boring to me and in the end i did not like it much; i do prefer an actual day/night cycle during gameplay.

I did enjoy my time with the game but it could have been much more as some parts feel rushed and out of place, even reused too much.",1701048091,1701048091,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you can accept that the Black Box Era is no longer a thing that will happen, I think you'll love this game. Your classic NFS-Cheesy storyline thats still engaging and fun, and still has horrible writing (Every NFS game does) and a soundtrack thats honestly very solid, and only got the hate it did because its not 2006 anymore. My favorite Modern Need For Speed game (Post 2010..? I suppose?) and it isnt even close. If youre unsure still wait for a sale, but I got more than my money's worth from this game. 

The online has been revamped since launch as well and is now very playable and very fun, the only issue i have is that it is so hard to unlock half of the cars, i have almost 200 hours and still dont have 2/3rds of the roster online. Big L in that department, but the playlists and linkups are very fun.

You need to use an EA account online with this game though, which is a nightmare as using Origin always will be, your friend list will not sync, and youll need to re-add all of your friends in EA, and only 4 player parties, two MASSIVE frustrations. There are ways to cheese the parties to allow for more than 4 but it is a pain in the butt and a shame you need to work so hard to play with 6 or 7 friends at the same time, howver, once you DO get everyone in and settled, its a very fun experience and Alllllmost worth the trouble setting it up. 

All in all, a very fun game, with a solid story by NFS standards, more personality than it has had in about a Decade, and an online that's fun enough to keep you coming back every once and awhile after you beat the game too.

The city looks amazing, feels alive, the cars have enough realism to feel good but manageable. The problem is great feeling modern physics combined with courses that belong in a 90's arcade cabinet. 

Lastly NITROUS, honestly the worst offender. I dislike nitrous to start with and the ""burst nitrous"" system is horrible. Just let us disable nitrous all together.

The colorful theme in this current game reminds me NFS Nitro. Although Criterion tested the water, there are many issues in this game.

Recycled content is the main issue since NFS 2015. Both cars and Frostbite engine have been using in 4 games. These things make the game repetitive for me, Secondly, the map is so dull and tiny especially in non-city area, but I really appreciate that the city feels alive more than NFS Heat because of pedestrians walking around and gimmicks in the city such as opening bridges and tunnel which older NFS titles don't have. Handling still unstable like in the older games which still use Frostbite engine, but the racing gameplay is quite intense because of burst nitro getting from near misses and being on air. That is the reason why I enjoy highway racing.

Speaking of new content, updating content in NFS Unbound is better than NFS Heat. The content is new cars and game mode for free unlike NFS Heat where the new cars are paid DLC. Paid content in NFS Unbound is mostly cosmetic.
Not only new content, online mode is much more attractive players to play. Class racing and co-op linkups make players enjoy online mode more.

I know that music is subjective, but many people despise the soundtracks in the current game just because few horrible soundtracks that they don't like. So, NFS Unbound becomes infamous for bad soundtracks which is not true. I think that NFS Unbound's soundtracks are diverse in term of genres and international representation which I do enjoy them. Those people are just biased with their own nostalgia because of better soundtracks in the old titles.

In conclusion, NFS Unbound is still decent game If you still enjoy illegal street racing theme which other racing games don't have. Despite microtransactions, NFS Unbound do better in term of proper new content. I recommend you to buy when there is a discount sale. Full price is not worth anyway.

A fun story that NFS is no stranger to (betrayal) is truly only the beginning. A revamped heat system will have you earning big throughout the day and into the night. This allows for quicker access to high heat races, where cars can be won, at night.
After the career mode is completed, your online garage will contain all of the cars that you've earned through unlocking. This means that without spending a single dollar of online currency, you can have a whole fleet of cars to tune, sell, or customize.
Customization is quite similar to Heat, with some specific pieces missing, but far more unique builds being available.
Also, the pressure to win every single race is not as high, as every place will still be raking in some cash. In an arcade racer, this is a welcome change. 

The map of Unbound seems larger than the map of the previous NFS game, NFS : Heat. Compared to Heat's Palm city, Lakeshore city has much more complex highway systems and districts for exploration.

I played most of Need for Speed series. And have finished some of them, just like Need for Speed Heat, NFS Rivals, etc. but, I played them on my playstation 5 and playstation 4 console, also on my nintendo switch.
The best car I used are lamborghini series, bugatti series, McLaren series, ferrari series, porsche series, BMW series, mazda series, nissan series.

But when the game works, it works well and it is actually fun! There are a lot of issues with certain cars being overpowered compared to others, not handling realistically, you can get a small bump and your car may go flying. At the end of the day, this is an arcade racer. Its got its quirky bugs, but its fun! When you get down to those races where you find a good opponent who wants a fair race and you battle neck and neck all the way to the finish line and your on the edge of your seat, Those are the races that make this game worth it!!! For what it is, its defiantly something to boot up if you wanna pass time and have a good time!  Is it worth the price tag? No, I would wait and grab it on sale due to the bugs. One of my main issues with this game is the STATS when customizing cars. The stats are not accurate. I can prove it. The biggest example is the :""""Fastest Car in the game:"", states to have a top speed of 265. but when you drive it, it tops out at 245. The stats lie to you on a lot of cars. On ""paper"" some cars should SMOKE others in a straight line drag, according to the stats.... But they don't and its very frustrating when you grind a lot of hours to make money to upgrade a car and it doesn't perform as the stats say it should. If you don't take this game too seriously and just want a good time, I would recommend it. I think if this game had a $30 or $40 price tag with its current state at the time of writing this, it would have much better reviews. I will continue to play this on and off, but with no real end game content and the same few revolving maps, its hard to stay on this game too long without taking breaks due to it getting repetitive at times. When that mood hits and you got the ""Need for Speed"" its a good time! (I know that was corny lol, but i had to!).",1677193967,1700947178,True,0,0,0.485853075981140137,0,True,False,False

I think the mechanics are great, the physics are okay (which means great for a modern NFS), I love the car list and the customization, and the game just looks beautiful. These are the factors that NFS:Unbound improved over its predecessor, and when the concept works, the game feels great. The new style of NFS also works I think; I like the personality. However, the problem is that it rarely feels that way, particularly because I find the game to be terribly balanced, the cops being a problem in particular. Rarely are you not in pursuit, and it gets in the way when you want to get stuff done (and you absolutely have to, because the game obligates you to grind!). So the game ends up being a chore, and I decided to uninstall it because I realized, I was not having fun the way I had fun in Heat, 2015, or any of the great classics.

I love challenges, that's why I set the game in the hardest difficulty, knowing beforehand that this game was particularly hard. But the tricks the game pulls to achieve that difficulty often feels cheap. I don't know if the game is developed that way, or it's just bad luck, but in several night races I am the only racer being chased with the cops trying to crash into me and get me off the track. It doesn't feel like you're in control whether you're going to win a race or not. I didn't have a problem outrunning the cops either, I only got arrested 'cause I wanted to see what the procedure was, but the fact that you have to lose them virtually every time you start and finish a race... Ugh.

Doesn't feel like the story was any interesting, although it was not as bad as Payback's. And the extremely forced politic narrative was yikes; Heat did it so much better.

So in conclusion, despite the game having great potential, I cannot recommend it, because I don't think you end up having a good time with it. If you're looking to catch up with newer NFS titles, I'd say start with Heat, give 2015 a try (plus, you have Toyota!) or look elsewhere; Motorfest seems to have had a solid start, and TDU Solar Crown is coming strong!",1700934855,1700934855,False,5,1,0.567496716976165771,2,True,False,False

Decent gameplay, they introduced a few things I have always wanted in NFS, namely betting and risk. Also the limited amount of restarts is a treat. The day and night system is now more equal, there is risk in both the times.

The car progression is okayish.

The physics are solid and the handling, although inconsistent, feels good to play with, especially with the new Burst Nitrous feature which makes for an interesting play style. The customization is great and the grind online isn't an absolute pain, though it doesn't absolutely spoil you either. The graphics are beautiful and the graffiti effects and stylized smoke is a very nice touch. The soundtrack for the most part is exactly what you would want in a game like this, albeit lacking in actual racing music. The story is fine for a racing game and the multiplayer is fun from races to drifting to linkups, though it's best experienced with friends. Criterion is also continuing support with this game, even into 2024 which is great and even record breaking for NFS so I'm onboard for what's yet to come. If you want a modern racing game that's fun, stylish, full of customization and just a general good time, I recommend Unbound, though buy it on sale. No game should be worth any more than $50 unless it's immensely polished and vast. It's no realistic festival racer sim like Forza nor is it a game with hundreds and hundreds of cars like The Crew.

Story itself is not that bad. Could have done more with Alec and Tess, missed opportunity there. 
Making classes for cars doesnt work that well in my opinion because at some point you dont even want to pick up cars below A+.
Police is lackluster at best. lvl 1-4 is too easy and level 5 is lacking the ammount of heavy units, Beside you can outplay all of them very easy.
Drifting is better than Heat, at least you can keep it up now and cars actually try  3th,4th gear, not automaticaly going to 2nd and staying there.
Im very happy to see that grip handling made a comeback and its working rather well

Im pretty sure i will not come back to this entry but its going in right direction.

You can customise your characters looks including gender, clothing, facial features in both story mode and online.
Lots of cars (70+ and you can own unlimited and multiple of each, tunes for different specs etc) (kind of grindey to unlock some of them though, especially how you have to unlock them online and offline independently of each other if you're like me and like to complete single player before jumping online - however cars rewarded from certain challenges give you the car as a reward in both modes).
 Lots of customisation for most cars including front & rear bumpers, side skirts, spoilers, front & rear splitters, rims, hoods, window tint, neons, exhaust sound customisation, complete body kits, ride height & fenders.
Police AI is brutal at times in lower end cars (classes B to A+) at high heat levels (4+) however in single player (and maybe online in low end cars) I would recommend using the anti-police attachments to help evade them). 
Component AI I found an okay challenge and not too rubber-bandy on Normal difficulty.
There are not many race modes unfortunately (Sprint, Street race, speed race (basically a long sprint) and drift. Races are usually grouped into events which usually consist of 3 of the same type of race - sometimes for a single class of car, sometimes mixed.
Online there are ""link-ups"" which seem randomly triggered throughout playing free-roam (16 players on each server/session by the way) which earn you XP and cash for grouping up with other players in pre-set random locations to do sets of challenges such as drifting, stunts, etc.
Online is also cross-play with PlayStation and Xbox to help keep the player numbers up and good for those with friends on those platforms I guess.
There have been a couple issues (the most recent being the game crashing randomly for a wide amount of users which was not fixed by EA for 2 weeks! EA provided terrible support during this time and did not really treat the issue the way they should have - the game was literally unplayable for lots of players for more than 2 weeks...) 
The driving physics are great for an arcade racer on a controller and take quite a bit of getting used to every time you switch car but every car feels different and can be tuned (mostly) to how you like driving (use the handling options in the perfromance/pause menu and performance parts (e.g tyres come in grip/standard/drift spec- both set individually per car which is quite nice).

In terms of optmisation; the game runs okay but could run better on my i7 6950X @4.1Ghz and 6800XT but it stays around 60FPS on medium settings at 2560x1440.
Bear in mind though at the time of writing this I'm using VFIO/UNRAID with Windows 10 as a virtual machine with 8 CPU cores and 30GB RAM so it would likely run better if I had the full CPU to use (or had more cores available to my guest OS).

Overall I think a good & fun arcade racer slightly let down by it's grindish nature to unlock cars and lack of variation in tracks and game modes. And EA, don't forget about EA.

Pros: Its got a unique art/visual style, that while not everyone will enjoy we should be able to agree that its new to NFS, I personally think it looks great. The racing is pretty entertaining when you are driving your favorite cars, and the music is good. These 3 things make for a fun time for someone like me who hasn't played a racing game in years. I recommend it on discount. 

This game also has many flaws. In my opinion there was a lack of customization options for some of the vehicles.  The AI can be straight up ridiculous at times too in this game. I've seen them crash into shit and it doesn't slow them down one single bit. A more recent experience was in a 
S+ ""Corner King"" race where a MF NPC in a rear wheel drive Ferrari was taking corners at 150 mph easy and my AWD GTR with all the max upgrades could not keep up, even after taking corners perfectly... hmm OK I guess. Also I saw no Toyota or Audi in this game which was kind of a bummer...

The cops, however, are by far my biggest pet peeve in this game. After finishing races during the day you will be getting a wanted level between one and five. The more races you participate in the higher your wanted level is. 4-5 are a complete pain in the ass. cops will show up everywhere. Oh and that wanted level caries over into the night too but gets reset during the next day. So I'm finding myself doing one race in the day now and one at night for the most part just to avoid that headache. 

Overall though for me its been a fun game considering I haven't played a NFS title since ProStreet. I would wait for it to be on sale again before buying it.  I would love if EA cared enough to balance some things out but who knows.

Driving and handling are unexpectedly good and easily the best among NFS games since 2007, modifications reflect a tangible effect on car physics. 
- I'm really surprised that art style doesn't bother me at all, and driving effects piqued my interest, but would be better to allow disable option.
- Dialogues are way better than many NFS games we've seen in the last 10 years, decent story given that we're talking about a racing game. I like how you can see your competitors as actual people and bet with them instead of just a list of names on your screen. 
- Music is something unique, Many people find it weird to play tracks from multiple foreign countries like Russia, India, Spain, and Arabia. but it works very well for me. 

- Progress sucks and you have to do the same things over and over every in-game day in order to pass the week and for the next week guess what? It's the same thing -_-
The game suffers from a lack of variety, there are only circuit, sprint, drifting, and time trial races. And the mere fact there are only about 70 races makes it worse. 
- Cops are everywhere and spawn at an arbitrary rate, it's almost impossible to get from point A to B without engaging in a police chase. Worth mentioning that cops are fu# king hard to escape especially at Heat 3 or more. I swear to god that I spent a third of the time just trying to get rid of them.

They did a good job developing the core of this game but wrecked the whole experience with dumb decisions, which can be all buffed by one update.

+:
1:I like the race structure where you have to put up money for races, also that some events give more Heat then other, makes it a bit of planning each day on what raceses to do first or at all.
-
1: The story, Its just weak, alot of cringe and you don't really care about youre character  due to his/her pesona is a douchebag with the most cringe responses I have ever heard in a game, bring back Ryan Cooper, keep the protagonist silent or write a good story. Main characters are also real bad, everything sounds and feels like a game for ""THE COOL KIDS"".
2: The drifting, So they added cartoon smoke when you drift (No problem there) but to push this new effect you can't make a turn without drifting, drifting in a street race drops way more speed then you gain doing a drift but alot of corners you have to do it. 
3:  Events: So this is a problem in the start, due to cash is hard to comeby and you mainly gonna have 1-3 cars before getting to week one showdown you are forced to change your tuning for youre car for drift, takedown events and then turn in back for normal events. It also reward you of having 2-4 cars, 2 of the highest class and 2 for the lower class where the two is one race car and one drift car. 
4: The Car rank system: I just feel this is lazy, would rader have higher priceses for upgrades then bottlenecking a car so it don't go up to S when you are in A+. Stop stealing Forza stuff and do a NFS game. 
5: Resets; I feel that this is a good thing in it self just kinda get punished with the game it self, due to one small mistake can be the diffrence from nr1 or last, and a mistake can be something you kinda don't have any controll over, like a cop or opponent crashes in to you so you get a reset, or in drift / takedown events a jump just buggs out and you lose your combo.

Other notes:
I feel the cars feel sluggish, just finished Pro street for the 50th time and the cars and modes in that game just feel 100 times better, Im not saying the handeling of cars are bad, but it just feels boring some times.
Drift raceses: Just feel wierd, it not drifting, more of taking a corner use nos to the checkpoint and don't loose your combo, it should be a drift race where you need to keep your drift going around a track.
The music: Feels sad that its now 100% trap music, like some songs are okey, fun that there are songs in other languages, but what happen to the mix?

All in all, its a modern NFS game, nothing changed from the last really. Would be nice if they went back and focused on what worked in the past, and drop the Agenda driven story race game and make it a fun car game of the mid 2000.",1700834789,1700834789,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At a time when most other racing games are striving for photorealism, EA's latest distinguishes itself from the rest of the grid by adopting a stylized mix between reality and comic books.  While its cars land on the side of realism, the characters behind the wheel are cel-shaded and its open world falls somewhere in between the two aesthetics. Vivid graffiti-style flourishes also pop up when you activate nitrous or fly off a ramp, and drifting kicks up colorful tire smoke that looks hand-drawn, with all of these effects punctuating the action with a unique sense of style.

There aren't any modern racing games that look quite like it, yet the rest of Unbound feels like a continuation of 2019's Need for Speed Heat. From the distinction between day and night races to the cat-and-mouse chase that occurs when you have to outrun the cops and make it to a safe house in order to bank your money. Unbound doesn't attempt to reinvent the wheel, but what's here maintains the series' recent quality, even if there are some wrong turns along the way.

As is now customary in Need for Speed games, Unbound features a rather forgettable story about getting back at a former friend who stole your ride. There's little point in delving into details because, ultimately, it's inconsequential. Cutscenes are sprinkled in every now and then, but for the most part, the story is just sort of there, happening in the background as you drive around the city, so at least it's unobtrusive. There's some fun incidental dialogue every now and then, including one mission where you're traveling with a ""weeb racer"" who spends the whole journey telling you about the history of anime and how it definitely isn't a cartoon. Rapper A$AP Rocky also makes an appearance (because why not?) and it feels like he was given a microphone and free rein to say whatever came to mind. It's a moment that stands out in a game that's filled to the brim with ancillary dialogue. Aside from this, the story is relatively easy to ignore, but it does succeed in giving impetus to the game's structure.

Unbound takes place across four in-game weeks. At the end of each week, there's a series of qualifying races that eventually lead to a grand finale where your aim is to exact revenge by winning the whole thing. There's a buy-in for each qualifier, so you'll spend the days leading up to each one taking part in various races and events in order to earn enough money to enter and upgrade your car along the way. Aside from racking up stacks of cash, each of these events also catches the attention of the local police force. If you're busted by the cops before making it back to a safe house, you lose all of your winnings and must move on to the next day, adding tension to each run-in with the law.

Need for Speed Heat adopted a similar structure, but while that game featured legal street races throughout the day and illegal street races at night, Unbound takes the illicit route 24/7. This means there's no respite from the police's attention, and any money you make during sunlight hours needs to be banked at a safe house before you can transition to the evening's races. Your heat level carries over, too, and only resets once you're done for the night, so it's up to you how much police presence you want to accumulate throughout the day before the sun disappears over the horizon. Night events tend to feature significantly higher payouts, but they often require a particular level of heat or a sizeable buy-in if you want to participate. You can still earn money taking on smaller events, but the increased risk of the larger events comes with big cash prizes. You're forced to weigh up your options when deciding what to do on a day-to-day basis.

These decisions are more impactful during the early game when the cars you're driving aren't quite up to snuff. Unbound is surprisingly challenging in its first few hours, and I appreciate how hard it makes you work to achieve victory. You're competing against drivers that are simply faster than you, racing in souped-up cars that your initial junker can't keep up with. You begin by butting heads with those at the back of the pack, but you can place a bet at the start of each race that you'll finish above a certain driver, giving you the chance to earn some extra cash while setting a target to beat even if you're not competing for first place. Eventually, as the money starts flowing in and you're able to afford more vehicle upgrades, you can see the gap close as you start achieving higher finishes and picking up victories. You're made to work your way up and the end result is a palpable and satisfying sense of progression.

Unbound's driving model is also flexible enough to allow for a couple of different racing styles. Each car's handling falls into one of three categories: drift, grip, and neutral (which sits in the middle of the other two.) If you love careening around corners sideways, a car that emphasizes drifting will make life easier. On the other hand, if you prefer slowing down and hitting the apex of each corner, a grippy car is advantageous. Whichever style you choose rewards you with a chunk of nitrous for pulling these cornering techniques off successfully, which makes both viable. No matter which car you choose, however, they're all afflicted with a severe case of understeer. This makes it feel like you're trying to steer a bus around the city, but I found that you can alleviate the issue somewhat by going into each vehicle's handling settings and moving the slider for steering sensitivity to ""high."" It's not an ideal solution but does make the handling feel more responsive and precise.

Like other arcade racers of its ilk, Unbound is built around accumulating NOS by performing different actions such as drafting behind other racers, driving into oncoming traffic, and getting airborne. You have a standardized nitrous meter that can be consumed in one go for a lengthy speed boost, but Unbound also introduces another type called Burst Nitrous. As the name implies, this lets you activate a short burst that operates off of its own charge system. Drifting, for instance, will fill up this separate meter, letting you explode out of a corner with a rapid surge of speed. It's a fun new addition that gives you more opportunities to take advantage of nitrous while also incentivizing risky driving.

The only downside is that the AI doesn't always play fair. Other drivers have a tendency to match your pace whenever you deploy nitrous, whether they themselves are boosting or not, which dilutes the delight that activating NOS should invoke. The leading AI car will sometimes zoom ahead as well, finishing the race more than 30 seconds faster than everyone else. This happens seemingly at random and feels like reverse rubber banding, giving you no chance of catching up.

- Awesome artstyle, first time i've ever seen an opening go so hard
- Decent selection of cars. all cars from heat plus a large number of welcome additions
- Graphics looks great at times, rain is nice in the city
- Customization is a world of its own


Cons:
- Cops deal more damage to you than you do to them, pretty much none at all
- Curbs can cause your car to lose control, this is REALLY BAD in city races 
- Soundtrack was handpicked to make your ears discombulate and live in agony for several years
- Handling can be really hit or miss with your car just going off course completely
- Wreck system is fucking painful with you just being completely halted after a collision, gets pretty bad when you're driving at 100+ km/h and you just hit a traffic car out of nowhere

Before I bought the game, I pretty much knew what I was walking into. I basically zeroed my expectations not to get disappointed again by my childhood love of a franchise. BUT I WAS SHOCKED!
The game's really good imo, in terms of a pure arcade racer that is. Sure, if you wanna drive every possible car in the world, from the year 1920 to 2023, you can try the FH series, but[b] NFS is NFS, and always will be NFS!!! [/b]
Drifts, Jumps, NOS, that's all it's about, kid. Although some may find it annoying, I pretty much like the cartoonish effects, and the zoomy feeling sound system. I'm fed up with Forza Horizon's realism and eye-melting graphics. This is amazing for a change.
Although the basic core of the game is the same as Heat, Payback and 2015, Criterion still did a solid job reworking the game from ground-up.
 [b] How I rate this game? A solid 82/100. [/b]

Cons:

- Weird graphics; NOT talking about the cartoonish visuals! Just the weird AA, and abrupt textures
- Un-smooth handling! It takes a while to get used to the handling of a car, and once you do, the time has come for you to switch to a new car.
- Gen-Z and Zoomy, cheesy-feeling dialogues. No matter how old you are, when you play Unbound, you start to feel 14!

A new speedlist that include police pursuit in races was introduced into multiplayer mode, which is nice. Other than that, new car, new speedpass reward, and some boost race rewards.

If you really wanna play this game then by all mean, buy it. But, I recommend to buy it during steam sales.

Update:

Online Multiplayer have police now but only during freeroam, game economy has been improve, new car, new race track. And that is it. Still not worth buying at full price tho, just buy it on huge discount sale.

edit: for achievement lol 

The positive:
1. FWD and AWD cars are fun to play now, unlike in Heat where FWD and AWD cars mostly are hot garbage.

2. Improvement in single player progression. Finally you don't have to do hardcore grind in early game then speedrunning the single player mode.

3. Introduction of class race make the gameplay more interesting. This force player to create cars for each classes. 

4. Grip build are relevant now.

5. 1 step improvement in online mode. From what I experienced, players are more eager to participate in race compare to Heat online mode. Well, there's a reason why players keep participating anyway,

6. The visual effect surprisingly not that bad as I expected after watching the trailer. In fact, I kinda like it.

The negative:
1. They butchered drifting mechanic in this game. The reason why I like Heat so much because drifting was so fun to do in that game. It feel so nice when you perform drifting while in high speed, hell even if you equip grip tire you still can do drifting when entering corner without losing speed. Unbound on the other hand decide to ""F drifting, ma boi Grip gonna have that spotlight now"". Drifting in this game is suck ass, it feels heavy, it make your car slow, and controlling drifting in this game is a pain in the butt.

2. 4 steps backward in online mode. 1st there's no police in online mode, Heat was so fun to play especially in online mode because of the police presence. It was so fun to watch friend getting chased by the police. 
2nd, remember what I said about players are eager to participate in race? It is because of the economy in online mode, getting cash in online mode is grindy AF. The highest cash that you can get is around ~30k, that if you race against 7 player (which is sometimes are uncommon to happened), and in S+ class race.
3rd, there is no night freeroam for online mode.
4th, they decrease the party size for online mode. 

3. Some cars are pretty OP in this game, like for example Regera which are frequently use in S+ class race. If you use other car to race against Regera, you won't stand a chance to beat it. Even with the January 2023 patch, that car is still OP.

4. Post game content for single player mode are nowhere to be found. Heat does have post game contents, and by complete it you will unlock new races and cars.

5. Like Heat, the world map is somewhat boring.

6. Story is kinda meh. They hyped ASAP Rocky so much in the game trailer but he never appear in story. You can meet him at some point in the game in the form of delivery mission, and it was....... uninteresting. yeah he speak, but it is more like he is monologuing instead of interacting with our character in the form of chatting lol.

On the fence: 
1. Driving mechanic, it is more deeper than Heat. There's a term of microdrifting, chirping or whatever. I really appreciate that Criterion bump up the driving mechanic in this game, but at the same time, NFS for me is a fully arcade racing game where I wanna push acceleration 100% all the time instead of feathering the throttle. If I want to play a game that have this kind of driving mechanic, I'd play Forza Horizon over NFS Unbound.

2. Single player progression (cash, purchased car) doesn't carry over to online mode, but the cars that you gain from completing several mission in single player mode will be carry over. It make sense since you can't progress story in online mode unlike in Heat. And, I think the developer want to increase the playing time for this game, which is great because if the game is good, then I want to keep playing. But, at the same time, the game is still grindy AF, which is kinda become a chore as you keep playing in online mode.

Overall, this game is not that great in term of fun factor, it is grindy, B class and S+ class online races are plague with OP cars. Driving mechanic is okayish but drifting is dead in this game. ASAP Rocky is in this game, but he is just side side side side character in the game.",1675013818,1700749724,True,0,0,0.540572822093963623,0,True,False,False

But with many drawbacks (horrible story, the much more grindy economy, very similar map design to Heat, the lack of offroad races etc.) makes the game feel less refined when the game was supposed to have one more year of development. Not to mention the steep price when not in discount makes it hard to justify the purchasing of this game.

I subscribed to EA play membership only for this June's Skyline V-spec reward and instead of receiving the car straight out of my in-game garage like the adds said, I got only 10% off of every purchases (how wonderful :))))). Then I do some research about this problem and contact with EA support but still no respond. I did come across some forums and they all have the same result which they didn't receive any gifts or rewards like EA promised. The only circumstance I can come up with was resulted from the buyer mistake like in my case when I bought the NFS game on steam but subscribe to EA play through the EA app because I cant find EA membership on steam plus buying it from the EA app was way easier for me. Thus it said on the store pages of both sides that linking account was all it takes to have EA play rewards in-game. If my guess is true, be aware of yourself when choosing the same platform to buy the membership or any add-on contents. Don't be careless like me and now I can't even ask for a refund.

Need for Speed: UnBound catapults players into the heart of urban racing, delivering an adrenaline-fueled experience that blends breakneck speed, stunning visuals, and a diverse array of customizable vehicles. Developed by Ghost Games and published by Electronic Arts, UnBound seeks to reignite the franchise's legacy of high-octane racing, and it does so with a mix of successes and a few stumbling blocks.

Graphics and Visuals:
One of the standout features of UnBound is its visually stunning presentation. The game boasts meticulously crafted cityscapes that come alive with dynamic weather effects, neon-lit streets, and an impressive level of detail in both vehicles and environments. The sheer realism and attention to graphical fidelity elevate the overall gaming experience, immersing players in a visually arresting world that enhances the thrill of the race.

Gameplay and Controls:
UnBound impresses with its responsive and intuitive controls, offering a seamless transition between various racing styles. The game provides a diverse selection of vehicles, each with its unique handling characteristics, ensuring that players can find a driving style that suits their preferences. The inclusion of an extensive customization system allows players to fine-tune their rides, adding a layer of personalization to the intense racing experience.

The core gameplay revolves around a compelling narrative that intertwines with the races, adding an extra layer of motivation to compete and progress through the game. From high-speed pursuits to intricate drift challenges, UnBound caters to a variety of racing preferences, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Storyline:
While the narrative is a commendable addition, it falls short of achieving the depth seen in some of the series' earlier titles. The storyline feels somewhat formulaic and lacks the emotional impact needed to truly immerse players in the world of illegal street racing. Despite this, the narrative does provide a cohesive structure to the game, guiding players through a series of progressively challenging events.

Multiplayer and Online Features:

Conclusion:
Need for Speed: UnBound is a commendable addition to the iconic racing franchise, offering a visually striking and exhilarating racing experience. While the narrative may not reach the heights of some of its predecessors, the game compensates with stellar graphics, diverse gameplay, and a robust online component. Racing enthusiasts and fans of the series will find plenty to enjoy in UnBound, making it a worthy entry in the long-standing Need for Speed legacy.",1700721379,1700721379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- repetitive

EA Launcher - has a bug, a very annoying bug. If you wanna play on a laptop and you have a integrated GPU with even 1mb more VRAM than the dedicated GPU, the game won't run on your dedicated GPU, you really need to go to BIOS (or where ever you have the options) to reduce you integrated VRAM to actually play this shit.

The graphics look amazing. Map was fairly decent. Performance is okay on a RTX 3070. Soundtrack is meh. Car customization is almost identical like NFS heat. Some new cars were added but some brands are not present from NFS heat. Story and characters are forgettable. i hate the fact that your money and cars cant switch story to online (NFS heat did that why not this game???) The online has cross platform as it should. Good to see that they are actively updating this game and not ditching it early like they did with NFS heat. Stay away from the overpriced dlc. Cop chases was difficult. 

Overall not the worst game i played. would i recommend this to a hardcore nfs fan? Depends. (only when the game is on sale)

Would i recommend this to a casual gamer? No, get NFS heat instead.",1700629355,1700629355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Criterion carrying on support for almost a year after its release is a huge plus (Heat got left in the dirt months after release). Get it on sale, and knock yourself out. Don't have too high expectations even if it has Need for Speed on its name and enjoy the game for what it is. Highly recommend you get mods for this game (Unbound Remix or wait until Unbound Unite gets released).

Pros:
-An assortment of cars and customization which isn't new for a modern NFS title
***Some cars, per usual by request of manufacturer, do not have customization except for wheels and license plates like the McLaren P1 GTR or Ferrari Testarossa.
***As of the writing of this review, 5 unique cars have been added through updates (1 car per update).
-Frequent updates keep the game fresh
-Crossplay with consoles (PS5/Xbox Series X&S)
-Modding support from the community
-Battle Pass system is completely free, no purchases required.

Cons:
-Soundtrack is a bit lackluster IMO, but to each their own.
-Car performance tier system as of the moment feels like it limits a lot of the cars' usability
-Cheaters make their appearance once in a while
-REQUIRES SSD to be playable, in my experience the game gets HORRIBLE texture pop-ins during gameplay if it's installed on an HDD.
-Some DLCs are obviously cashgrabs, stay away from them.",1700627060,1700627060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art style is what pulled me in the most and it is as beautiful as the trailers and pictures. It makes nitrous, ramming cops, drifting, and drafting feel way more impactful and make brain go brrr

The extraction system makes the risk/reward way higher and gives you a better sense of accomplishment when winning races and escaping police pursuits which is amazing compared to just being able to restart races until you win. 

Overall, I would strongly recommend this game on sale if you are debating on getting it.

I know this goes without being said, but this is a street racing game. If you are looking for a simulator-like game, you probably wouldn't be a fan of this.",1673490041,1700626633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its so refreshing to see they tried new things, style with this game. Finally something new in the arcade genre.
They copied some elements from horizon, but not too much.

I know that this isn't an excuse for ""bad driving mechanics"", for me they are decent (drifting is a bit clunky), but there are also a lot of mods that completely overhaul pretty much all aspects of the game.

I haven't completed the story yet, but it seems pretty weak, but do we really buy NFS titles for stories lmao.

The graphics look pretty nice, but the game is relatively demanding. Running a RTX3080, Ryzen 5 5600x, 16Gb setup and I sometimes do drop below 60Fps, but DLSS helps out a lot. Since I haven't completed the story, I can't really say if there are Off Road parts of the game, but for now there are non and that's a plus from me.
I hated the Off Road parts in Payback, seems like it's just street races.

I am seriously struggling to find things to add to the list of pros as I write this. One of the few games I have EVER PLAYED that is infuriating enough to make me rage quit, which really says something given the size of my library.

PROS:
-Big step up in car variety
-Character and car customization largely improved (don't expect Forza levels though)
-Progression is noticeable and rewarding, albeit railroaded
-Nice map with a lot of variety

CONS:
-Some of the worst camera shake I have ever seen, even with it set to 0%
-Physics are ABSOLUTELY AWFUL, making them extremely annoying a lot of the time, especially when using nos
-Weak (this is being generous) soundtrack and awful dialogue, I muted both within my first hour of playing and just listen to my own playlists
-Poorly optimized
-Story is stupid
-Hateable characters
-Cops are more annoying than challenging
-Limited restarts
-Online play required for some things
-Sometimes AI racers simply won't move at the start of a race completely screwing you over
-Extremely grindy for an NFS game, can't do same race over and over again to farm cash

In closing, has a lot of potential for what it is, and I'll continue playing it; I just cannot recommend paying any more than I did for it.",1695927135,1700450638,False,5,0,0.569190561771392822,0,True,False,False

Visual style 9/10, even though I'd say 10/10 but there is people that simply won't like it.
Story and way it goes 1/10. I understand, lol what story in NFS...but it is one and this one is stupid.
Music 0/10. I can't even call it this way.

Remember oldschool Underground and Most Wanted or even Carbon? So Unbound is basically spit to gamers faces that played those games.

Is this game a joke or for real? I just want to tell people that were in charge of music for this game to quit what they are doing and take exit trough closest window.

And what is genius idea to make prologue where starting from Normal and playing almost ideally you barely can win any race, or even after until you actually upgrade your stuff good enough? It's not hard game but who decided to script races? I mean this isn't rogue-like game right?
P.S. Bonus: Abundance of mainstream agenda and godforsaken politics right from the start of the game might make you refund it right away because I regret already that I didn't.

I've almost completed the story and have been playing online a lot lately. Game play feels very smooth, no lag, no rate drops, I think the latest patch did the game justice.

I have a low/mid range prebuilt ASUS ROG desktop.

Edit: The intro is too long but once you get past that, most of the game feels like real NFS. There are still hokey graphics and cheesy parts of the story but you can finally sort out your own car and make it your own.

I still advise backing up your save file just to be safe.

Just 3 hours in I've hit a bug that requires me to delete my save and start from scratch.

Gameplay over all is the same but you have a new map to explore along with a new story which..... is alright. The story is serviceable and works for the game but it's pretty boring and uninteresting, same goes for the characters really.

Racing overall kinda feels the same as Heat but there is now a betting system with other racers as well as a new boost mechanic that changes it up a bit to keep it interesting. I don't really like the new boost mechanic as not only do you have to earn the boost by drifting, drafting, near-misses, grip-turns etc, but as soon as you fill the yellow bar you HAVE to use it in the span of about 5 secs or it disappears which sucks because most of the time you're not set up for a boost which can lead to you losing control and crashing. Heat did it right where your Boost would refill itself but YOU got to pick the right moments to use it to gain an advantage. Also Unbound has a lot less variety when it comes to race types and circuits. Heat had many different race circuits for Rally, Track, Road, Off-Road, but Unbound is primarily focused on just street racing with a little bit of off-roading thrown in there.

Customisation of the cars both parts and body wise is pretty good, it is quite literally a copy+paste from Heat. Sound design is pretty good in my opinion too.

Police are kinda ridiculous in this title, starting out you get slammed pretty hard with these unusually persistent cops that are pretty hard to outrun early-mid game. Not to mention the helicopter is a HUGE pain in the ass, you could lose the cops but then you would have to find cover while the police are out in numbers searching for you. I've had multiple experiences where I would be hiding from the cops, engine off, and they would all slowly converge on my position despite not knowing I was there at all.

The new Heat systems sucks, instead of the Heat multiplying your rep if you manage to safely get back to you garage at night, it's just an indicator of how fucked you will be once you're in a police chase. The heat level carries over from day too as well as some races automatically put you in a police chase right after you finish the damn thing. NFS:H got it right as well as having the legal street races during the day with no traffic and the illegal races at night with traffic. The traffic and music in this game fucking suck too, racing in S+ going 340km/ph on average is a recipe for disaster waiting to happen, the game becomes less about racing and more about dodging the traffic. The music is absolutely terrible, the same 15 songs just repeat over and over making me want to drive off a cliff, Spotify is a must for this game lmao.

Other little things that I didn't like were the physics acting really weird, hitting a car either propels you really fast forward or it randomly just flips your car a couple times. Not only that but death bounces occur when travelling at a fast speed, you hit a tiny tiny bump and you bounce a little, but then your car will keep on fucking bouncing causing you to lose control or you manage to slow down enough it subsides.

Overall NFS:UB is a generally 'Okay' NFS title, it did push the bar a little with the new stylised effects but not enough to differentiate itself from Heat's overall gameplay. 

I give this game a:

If you've read some of the negative reviews and then finish the game yourself, you realize most of the hate is directed towards things that would be totally okay in 90's, but not in 2022. True, the game has some design flaws, but it's generally a good game with some old-school elements.

For starters, if you are like me and most other players spoiled by Forza series, you probably did set difficulty to highest... which I do not recommend for first time playthrough. You will probably suffer and become frustrated as you will be earning just a small amount of money from AI that cheats, have more powerful cars and most importantly from cops that are quite difficult to lose with B or A class cars on higher heat levels. Partially it's because the game have a lousy tutorial and explains just a few things. For example up until about halfway through the Story mode, I had no idea what are those green circles that keep popping up around the map. I also had no idea that you can get money finding collectibles, completing challenges or playing with cops. The game just does not explain these mechanics, which it should.

The next suprising fact is that this game will not give you anything for free and will not make it easy for you, especially in terms of money. Even at lowest difficulty. Don't expect to be able to buy even a single spare car. The money is scarse at the beginning and first few hours you will be constantly racing against much more powerful opponents. If you like challenges, this game is for you, if you don't, go play Forza Horizon or some other open-world racing game.

What else is old-school about this game? Well, the story. The story is... there, but you can ignore it completely. It doesn't matter as there is nothing interesting, no real plot twists and to be honest, all characters are just really dumb and have no sense of logic. But all of this does not matter, because it's a racing game and what is most important in this genre? Driving gameplay.

Unbound gives you an option to choose from drift or grip, unfortunately to make either of these to work properly, you have to move the handling slider to at least 40%. This creates a problem for beginners as pretty much all cars have handling set right between drift and grip, so your car will not grip if you want it to grip and will not drift if you want it to drift. This kind of handling really sucks and I wanted to throw away my gamepad multiple times, because my car suddenly decided to turn on drifting mechanics for which I was not prepared and I ended up crashing. Simply put, cars with ""neutral"" handling are very twitchy and unpredictable. But once you choose to go fully grip or drift, this kind of behaviour will mostly disappear (but not always) and you will be rewarded with a pretty fun gameplay. I especially like the burst boosts - too bad the game will not explain to you how it works. You have to figure it out yourself.

What about the city/map? Well, I like the presence of a few straight roads - something we have not seen for a long time in NFS series, if ever. Other than that, the map is not exactly large and does not really offer anything special or memorable. Even after finishing the story and starting my 2nd playthrough on hardest difficulty, I constantly have no idea where I am and where to go. I keep opening the map and using navigation all the time, because I just have no idea. This is kinda strange as there are only a few meetup locations and safehouses.

Graphics and sound/music - Graphics is okay I guess. I'm not the kind of guy who bashes devs about lack of details or ugly graphics, as long as it looks fine, but I do kinda have a problem with popping road textures sometimes. Sounds are okay, nothing special, although for some reason the engine sounds have way lower volume than the rest of the game, so make sure to bump it up to 100% and lower everything else to 50%. Music is... trap. I thing it kinda fits the overall comix theme, but in my opinion this kind of music should only play in menus and garages, just like in NFSU2. For racing, I want something energetic and fast.

Story mode - Yes, you have to grind a lot, there are high buy-ins (sometimes up to 50% of the 1st place prizemoney) and there are cops everywhere and pretty much after every 2nd race, but the races are usually short and a lot of fun. If only there would be more diversity between races as there are only 3 kinds of races - races, takeovers and drifts. Two of them are not very viable if you go full grip tune, so that kinda sucks. I would like to see some knockouts, hot pursuit events or milestones, and some other possible variations. At least the map is full of short events that kinda substitute this, but you always do these alone. 

TL&DR
Pros:
-Some good ideas (cop spotting, day/night cycles)
-Fun gameplay once you understand it
-Two ways of driving (grip / drift)
-Challenging, if you like those
-Collectibles and short events
-Runs pretty well and I have not seen any bugs or glitches apart from the road textures issue (well, one year after the game was released)
-Dialogues are kinda fun

Cons: 
-Too many cops sometimes
-Trap music during races
-Difficult and frustrating driving physics for beginners
-Popping road textures
-Story mode is dull with very little diversity
-Grinding money can be a bit boring
-No cutscenes (not even intro)

All in all, I think this is a good game as I had a lot of fun playing. Even my stepdaughter played it and had so much fun.

The game was released on November 29, 2022, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. The game features a unique visual style that combines photorealistic cars with cartoonish characters and effects. The game’s story mode is disappointing, but the driving mechanics are solid, and the online mode is fun.

Gameplay Need for Speed Unbound’s gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, Need for Speed Heat. The game features a day/night cycle, with players competing in various races and events to earn money and reputation. The game’s driving mechanics are solid, with a good sense of speed and weight. The game also features a variety of customization options, allowing players to modify their cars’ appearance and performance.

Visuals Need for Speed Unbound’s visuals are its standout feature. The game features a unique visual style that combines photorealistic cars with cartoonish characters and effects. The game’s environments are vibrant and colorful, with a lot of attention to detail. However, the game’s visuals can be overwhelming at times, and the cartoonish characters can be distracting.

Why I don’t recommend it While Need for Speed Unbound has some solid driving mechanics and fun online modes, the game’s story mode is disappointing. The story is poorly written, and the characters are uninteresting. The game’s progression system is also restrictive, forcing players to grind for hours to unlock new cars and events. Overall, Need for Speed Unbound is a decent racing game, but it falls short of its potential due to its poor story mode and restrictive progression system.",1699288750,1699288750,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game does these things well :
- Car customization, as per Need For Speed : Heat, the customization here is the same, so no arguments here.
- The new cartoon-ish driving effects. Many are off-put by this, but I assure you it is pretty decent and doesn't takeaway the racing scene, it even accentuate the more colourful side of street racing.
- The racing was good, at least for me. I am not a massive car guy that knows every car sound, every car model specs, every top speed for each car and whatnot. I see a car, I like it, I buy it, I mod it, I race with it. Simple. This game does racing well, but it is arcade racing afterall, if you are looking for driving sim you are looking at the wrong place.

The weakness:
- Main story is kinda short in terms of actual happenings. Plots are minimal, but races aplenty. Ok in its own way, but the story is indeed kinda lackluster. After you have done one round of the story you have no reason to replay the singleplayer again.
- AI / system flaw. When you crash, you often feel like the AI catches up to you a little too fast? You are absolutely correct. This was not good. The crash cam did not skip time, instead, it relocates the AI racers ahead. This makes it that the ones behind you will catch up, but the ones ahead of you gets boosted to 2 checkpoints ahead. This is why everyone hates the likes of AI racer like Shimizu / Lyric / Medusa. They are also equipped with the absurd powerful cars and their AI racelines are almost perfect at all times. 
- Car balancing. Again like Heat, certain cars dominates due to the driving model they used. Some cars are absolutely powerful in every aspect, and some cars are horrible at all aspect. You can tune the handling, yes, but it doesn't help the fact that a B tier Mazda RX-8 will never be able to compete with a 911 RSR. So when it comes to multiplayer, expect to see the same 10-22 cars across all tiers. 
- Traffic. I cannot stress this enough. The AI racers seemed to be too smart for many cases, and the opposite is for the traffic. Too many times I have come across a junction to have an AI crossing the junction stop at my trajectory and what happens next is not fun.

Summary : Is a different theme from NFS : Heat. Does the customization well, car drives fast, tuning can be interesting for some. Skip this game if you are looking for a singleplayer experience. But if you like to race multiplayer, but is not tryhard enough, this game is a good fit. If you are a tryhard, this game can infuriate you in many aspect. I rate this game among the decent tier list of games. Good for a while, gets tiring in the long run.

Edit: They fucked up the linkups and boosted events since Vol 4 update. So basically features from Vol 4 onwards (Linkups and Boosted events) are a joke, they only appear in a few servers while everyone else cannot get access to them. For anyone that wants to try this game out, avoid it at all cost. EA fucked us all. Total incompetence. They had months to fix this, but they didn't even manage to find the root cause. MONTHS.

Edit again: They fixed it. Took them long enough.",1681369122,1698893416,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The visuals are somewhat distracting but the visual style and design of the game aren't all that bad. 
The real reason I haven't found the interest to finish it is because of the way the gameplay is designed. It follows an extremely narrow, linear, scheduled race system where you have some number of races you can complete in a day and once it's done that's it. Along with this, whatever ""heat "" you rack up during the day continues into the night which, not to mention there is apparently a need for limited retries on a race. All these factors make the game an absolute chore.
To summarize think GTA but you can't fight back and you always have cops on you.

but for those dickriding heat when they are the same people who said the same thing about heat on release are backpedalling now

pros:
1) Graphicly good game yes the art direction changed around vol 3 i think making the game ungodly brighter but the overall models of cars are great
2)wide selection of what you can and cant do with a car ik people moan and groan ""you CaNt DriFt A {insert awd car here}"" its a video game shut.
3) music now mostly the rap genre selection is good all the other indi or jus non hear of options are jus repetitive (FUCK PUNYAPAP its a shit song)
4) the multiplayer is nice having crossplay and always basicly a full lobby of 16 players at a time waffling about

cons
1) the story is litterally the safest option ever in the play book playing off nostalgia effect and basically hello fellow kids humour

most the cons side are just multiplayer tbvh
2) in multiplayer it is tied to fps so if you lag even a millisecond the game is jus not gonna be in your favour sorry those with  a lower end pc ik someone you struggles to play with other friends and I simply cause his frame-rate is barely 40 
3) every racing game is plagued with that one player in the lobby yk the ones Im bad so im gonna ram you and ruin the race.
3) metas current curse of any online mp game one minute there a vast selection of cars and customisation the next its 5 fucking same cars that top the class 
4) its a ea game everything is monitored and the servers are hit or miss need i say more?

jus pick up the game on a cheap key or sale dont buy at rsp

Pros:
- Super innovative dual NOS system which is underrated asf
- Best grip handling since blackbox games
- Easy to pick up hard to master drift physics
- Cops that dont make u rage quit but still challenging to evade
- God-tier customization
- Balanced car list, U can have full lobbies with everyone driving different cars and everyones reasonably competitive

- Need more variety in MP playlists and races
- Need bigger lobbies and party sizes

The Regera nerf is an attempt to stop it from dominating S+ class which is welcome but leaves a sour aftertaste, I would have much rather seen some other Cars buffed to be more competitive in S+ Class. The Golf GTI got nerfed too and seems to have been hit hard. It really had personality being wicked fast but being hard to Handle and I feel like the update diminished it's personality. Meanwhile the 3 Million Dollar Bugatti has been left untouched, now being hands down the Best Car in the game, with no close second remaining.

if the cartoony effects are scaring you from buying the game stop being a baby because they arent that noticeable and you can just the grey decal to mimic smoke.  they only show up when you do a big jump extended nitrous boost or a long drift.

Visually, Unbound adopts a unique, cartoony design that embraces the underground racing scene with an emphasis on graffiti. While this uniqueness is commendable, the visuals might not be everyone's preference. However, it adds a refreshing layer to car customisation and racing.

One standout feature in Unbound is the ""burst nitrous"" mechanic, offering a shorter but more powerful boost, adding a strategic element to the gameplay. It's a feature worth applauding and one that could be considered in future titles.

Nevertheless, Unbound stumbles when it comes to races, which are at the core of any Need for Speed game. The initiation of races through ""meetups"" is an improvement over Heat, but the races themselves lack variety and feel repetitive. It's a letdown considering the essential role of races in income generation.

The ""heat"" system, where races contribute to heat levels that carry from day to night, adds challenge but feels more frustrating than rewarding. 

The game introduces a restrictive car ranking system, limiting players to specific car ranks, hindering gameplay progression and enjoyment. This decision hampers the early game's pace and reduces the appeal of upgrading cars.

In summary, Need for Speed: Unbound has moments of enjoyment, particularly for those seeking high-speed racing reminiscent of the series' spirit. However, it doesn't measure up to its predecessor, Need for Speed: Heat. While its unique visuals and the ""burst nitrous"" mechanic provide intrigue, the game's repetitive races, frustrating heat system, restrictive car ranking, and scaling difficulty make it a less satisfying experience.

The worst game of the NFS franchise.
No game in the series had reached such a threshold of mediocrity.
I didn't know it was possible to hate a racing game before...

I've finished nearly every episode since 1994, and since 2011 the franchise is living an endless descent into hell. I am a veteran of the franchise, which sees tarnished year after year. 

Criterion, what have you done? Don't you remember Hot Pursuit? Or even Burnout?

EA have completely forgotten what makes a good racing game.

This game is a disastrous failure, from start to finish.

The handling of the cars is atrocious, at least when they're stock. They are heavy and unsteerable. I had to customize my cars enough to drift easily. 

Cars and parts are horribly expensive compared to old NFS. 

The scenario suck, probably written by retarded teens who don't know if they're boys or girls.

They even felt compelled to add a black trans character.

The Tiktok generation of brainless morons with pink and green hair is killing the franchise.

The characters are caricatured at will, with their cheey slang and their football haircut.

They spend their time taunting each other, when they overtake or are overtaken.

Same for the cops! They laugh at you when you drive badly and insult you when you run into them!

On the music side, we are very far from what the series has accustomed us to.

Forget Rock, Metal, basically music for white people.

Here, we are served only infamous Rap and Hip Hop, sung in several languages: English, French, Arabic, Russian and so on. The same sh!t with different sauces. 

The soundtrack makes me want to drill my eardrums and pour bleach on them.

The game is also incredibly vulgar compared to the old ones. Both the dialogues and the songs. I'm pretty sure it was to please the scum.

Forget the epic feeling of a Hot Pursuit or a Most Wanted, here the races are emotionless.

Oh wait, they can be annoying. Because you can be overtaken at the end on a straight line, by the person you bet against. That's crazy how good they are when you bet on them.

Another mega frustrating thing, the cops are only after the player in every race. Other streetracers can drive without getting disturbed.  

Also, there are way too much police chases, almost after every night races when your car is Heat Level 5! There are no pursuit breakers! 

And cops spawn close to you when you're escaping! It's really annoying! And the helicopters that spawn above you will get you mad. I mean, really mad. Frustration at its peak.

Police pursuits are terrible. TERRIBLE. You can see the cops spawn in front of you!

Offer this game to your child if you absolutely want him to change gender, or even ethnicity.

This woke game stinks of cringe and africanization runs through its veins. And vice versa.

I'll almost have to feel offended to play it as a straight cisgender, French, white dude.

I think I'm gonna puke, and not just hate. This game is definitely the black sheep of the series.

A this point, let the series die, rather than release such a crap game.

Even if it's on a big sale, don't take it. 

I'm serious.

You've been warned.

Launch Review:

PSA: EVEN IF YOU BUY THE PALACE EDITION YOU WILL NOT GET THE DLC THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GET.  ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?  ROFLMAO! [this might of been fixed since December 2022, i don't care.  Still didn't work on launch so this stays.]

TL;DR: 0/10: Inclusivity done wrong, limited restarted in A SINGLE PLAYER MODE, and a whole heap of other issues. Fuck EA, Fuck Origin & fuck this trash AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  IF YOU *MUST* then get it for free.  The worst need for speed game I've played in years.

Only after days of copium have I come to give a tiny shit of this game.

No wonder why you wouldn't let us review this shit early and forced us to wait.  It's literal garbage. By far THE WORST NEED FOR SPEED GAME behind the ""Most wanted"" EA shilled when in reality it was fucking burnout paradise 2. 

This was your last fucking chance and you ruined it.  Good job Electronic Arts.  You will never see a dime from me again.  Thankfully Steam had the balls to refund me for your mistake.  MAYBE you'll get a buck-a-roo when on sale, otherwise, fuck off. :)

- 80 bucks for a game I wouldn't even shill 10 - 20 dollars at, AT BEST. IF YOU MUST GET THIS, Then go into the depths of the internet.  Don't give EA your money. [Lmao you didn't even give Palace edition players the ""Keys to the city"".  Bad enough this shit costs 80+ USD, so why not another 5'er?]

- Requires Origin.  Get the fuck off of steam with this bullshit already.  Third party launchers are a plague.

- Cops don't give a fuck unless you're in an actual race.  Go 150mph right next to them?  They won't bat an eye.  Do it in an event and they'll be all over you like a fat cop on donuts.

- Limited restarts IN A SINGLE PLAYER STORY MODE.  WHOEEVER THOUGHT OF THIS NEEDS TO BE FIRED. IMMEDIATELY. 

- Super cartoony graphics but detailed cars?  Visual clash.

- Possibly THE WORST SOUNDTRACK out of EVERY NEED FOR SPEED GAME TO DATE.  As much as I fucking hate this game, its a bit better if you put on any other soundtrack.

- Ruptured my eardrums on the fucking login screen WHY MUST YOU PUT YOUR FUCKING SOUNDS AT 100% AT THE VERY BEGINNING

- EA play only rewards.  Fuck exclusivity. 

- Master sound @ 10% and ITS STILL TOO FUCKING LOUD

- You literally have to put a ""Please don't drive like this irl, and if you do, don't sue us UwU""  Are you kidding?  OF COURSE NOBODY IS GOING TO DRIVE LIKE THIS. and whomever does, I wish to introduce you to Darwin.   THIS IS A VIDEO GAME YOU KNOBHEAD.


-  THIS IS NOT EVEN GOING INTO THE GAMEPLAY YET

- ""Borderless window"" elavates its-self like the task manager to where nothing can be put behind it.

- they have a felony criminal in their game as well named ""ASAP Rocky"" who was charged with assault with a deadly weapon as well as an assault with a semiautomatic firearm on a different charge.  Dunno if this is a plus or minus for you, but, eh.  I can't stand mumble rappers, so this is a minus for me.


- You can not be a woman, only non-binary and male.  Every ""woman"" looks like a butch tomgirl with these ""clothing"" options.  Not my thing, could be yours.  The character customization has A LOT TO BE DESIRED.  AKA: It fucking sucks.


- HAD TO REMAKE MY FUCKING STORY CHARACTER IN MULTIPLAYER/VICE VERSA.  FUCK. YOU. As much as I enjoy charcter creation, fuck you for making me HAVE TO REDO MY ENTIRE GODDAMN CHARACTER for singleplayer/multiplayer?  Bruh.  It's 2022.  Other games already have seamless character creation, why don't you?  Yet the fucking currency you use to buy shit is linked to both online and single player.

- Another gripe: only black voice actors.  No asian, no white, only black.  Sure, you can 'tune' the voices, but they sound like a fucking chipmunk autotuner.  So, unless you want your character sounding like a chimpmunk or not matching the character what-so-ever, then this is the woke game for you.  This really bugged me.  You want to be inclusive, yet you're excluding others.

- 80 FUCKING DOLLARS FOR THIS GAME

Onto the semi-positives

~ The drifting felt nice one time.  The rest it felt either too slow, too fast, or uncontrollable.

~ A lot of customization, IF you pay for the pre-order to unlock the 'exlucivity' shit. So, more of a negative than a positive.

~ The car models looked okay.

~ No playstation controller options even though steam and every other game has them pre-loaded due to the fact people use a controller other than xbone for PC.

~ Pedestrians to 'make the game feel lived in'.  It really doesn't.  The cell shaded characters look so out of place with the 'realism' in this game.

+ drifting is fun

+ copium

They say it pays the cost to be the boss. Time to show 'em who's in charge.

Alright, I finished the game, time for an actual review.

I liked Unbound, and I DO recommend it... if the price drops significantly.

The difficulty in this game is a little out of whack. I know I am NOT good at video games in general, but still, early on, with the low class cars, the races are really unforgiving... but the Drift and Takeover events are a breeze and continue to be for the entire duration of the game; only once did I not get first place in one of those and that after I already completed the campaign. Whenever a Drift or Takeover event had a high reward, I'd make sure to go for it first because that was the only guaranteed winnings. In fact, I have had more troubles with performing well in offline races against the normal difficulty NPCs, than actual real players in the online mode for the game, that has never happened to me before in any game.

The campaign mode is robust enough, I feel. The characters you compete with are fun and actually banter with you during the races which is something NFS has never done before as far as I know, though more dialogue between the other characters amongst themselves would be nice too. Well, or maybe not, because I feel the dialogue in this game might get in the nerves of some people, not just the in-race dialogue, but the regular conversations between characters that goes on between the single player sessions. I personally don't mind, it's gotten a few giggles out of me.

The story is simple, in true Need for Speed fashion. It's not really the important part. It's just an excuse to get you racing and to introduce the mechanics that'll be present in the game. And the mechanics are fun enough. The more you race the more you'll get the attention of the police, which makes it riskier and riskier to continue racing, because if you get caught, all the money for the current session will be lost. You also have limited retries, if you don't get a good result, you might have to suck it up and move on, which is a *good* thing in my opinion, because in previous games, you could just restart ad infinitum till you got the best results, this game encourages you to take the L and move on. If you don't like that, switch to easy mode, you'll get plenty more retries then.

As for the online mode. Well, it's the reason I think the game is a little pricey as it stands. Now, don't get me wrong, the online races are A LOT OF FUN, and I had a blast with them, the new arcadey mechanics like the Burst Nitrous and the quick and snappy resetting in case you mess up lend themselves really well for online play, event are divided by car classes so there won't be a huge gap in car performance and it will in few cases be the deciding factor if you tune your car to compete in that class. But... the online mode is just that. It only has playlists of a few events you can invite the current lobby to. There are no cop chases, no unique game modes, no promised pink-slip races. It is very under developed. I can only hope the online mode gets enough updates to feel complete.",1670008703,1697685387,False,0,0,0.533487260341644287,0,True,False,False

Overall, it's another turn n' burn release, leaving a lot to be desired. Granted, it does go on SALE sometimes, the graphics are gorgeous, and you really can't expect much from NFS, anyways. If you liked the last couple games in the series and just need more, EA is back again to dole it out...

Here's what the game does decently: CAR HANDLING. Surprise! Unbound actually features a pretty balanced physics/handling mechanic. It feels like a refinement of the Ghost Games (EA Gothenburg) style of driving rather than the previous ""drift or die"" Criterion games. Sure, it's not great - There are going to be janky moments with the physics which may end up costing you a turn or a win, but thank goodness: Each car's physics profile is uniquely modeled, and you have access to some tuning settings. Driving your car carefully and discovering it's neutral handling qualities pays off, as opposed to stacking stats and button mashing.
 
There's also some great details. In addition to the very pretty, wet visual effects, Lakeshore is built like a real city. The checkpoint placement and visibility in every activity is refined and feels thoroughly play-tested. Also, the graffiti art you encounter, the single player plot, and the typical NFS ""street scene"" elements feel organic and beautiful here, not forced. It's minor, but I think they did these details better than previous games. 

So here's what sucks (in single player): THE POLICE. While they barely interfere during race events, they are a constant antagonist in freeroam when you're just trying to get from point A to B, day or night! NFS Heat and every game before it was able to strike a nice balance with the Police activity, but in this game, freeroam chases are a loathsome, time-wasting nightmare... 

Unless you sneak around the city timidly like some sort of stealth-survival car-ninja, you will be constantly battling cops! You will miss out on time-sensitive bonus objectives, and will generally be tearing around in circles like a chicken with your head cut off going asses and elbows against the Law. When you hit level 4 or 5 Heat, just go home immediately, unless you have nothing to lose. 

There's no significant reward for carrying high heat and escaping all these unwanted pursuits. You just get away with the luxury of not losing all your progress. I guess that's realistic - like the video game equivalent of getting into a brutal street-fight, winning, and then going home with nothing more than a bloody nose and and a black eye. Who wants to do that? 

My point is: Freeroam chases feel tedious. If you catch heat during a race, the follow up chase afterward is fun - but once you escape that, there's nothing new or fun about getting chased around in freeroam. The evasion mechanics should have been refined significantly. Aside from being able to blow by cops at low level without triggering them, and having helicopters eventually run out of fuel, there's nothing new or innovative about it. 

In combination with the ""Calendar"" system, this makes Career mode feel really rushed and stressful. It's five lanes of ten-speed, high-stakes terror every week, which makes it one of least enjoyable and exhausting single-player NFS experiences. 

So basically, the single-player experience kinda sucks. I recommend grinding it out till the end, because it gives you a huge leg-up in Online mode by earning free cars. Any car you've won in your single-player game transfers over to your Online garage (minus any upgrades). And speaking of Online - this is the best Online experience I've had in NFS so far, with balanced car classes, and reliable matchmaking and server connectivity!

In conclusion, if you are just looking for a good Single-Player NFS experience, go play NFS: Heat, or even Need For Speed (2015) if you haven't already. Even with their flaws, those games are more enjoyable than this campaign. But if you're just here to play the latest and greatest NFS Online, look no further!",1685909173,1697419801,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

As a devoted fan of the Need for Speed franchise, I couldn't help but approach Need for Speed Unbound with eager anticipation, especially after the adrenaline-fueled experience that was Need for Speed Heat. Unfortunately, Unbound proves to be a significant misstep, leaving me questioning the direction the series has taken.

One of the most glaring issues with Unbound is the lack of cohesion in its gameplay. While Heat excelled in providing a seamless blend of high-stakes racing and engaging storyline, Unbound feels disjointed and oddly paced. 

The driving mechanics, a hallmark of the Need for Speed series, also leave much to be desired. Where Heat offered tight, responsive controls that allowed for thrilling maneuvers through the neon-lit streets, Unbound stumbles with a noticeable lack of precision. It's a frustrating departure from the franchise's legacy of providing a visceral driving experience.

The visual aspect, too, disappoints in comparison to its predecessor. While Heat dazzled with its vibrant, immersive world, Unbound feels oddly muted and lacks the same level of attention to detail. The cityscape lacks the pulsating energy that made Heat's Palm City feel like a living, breathing entity.

Furthermore, the customization options, a staple of the franchise, are strangely limited in Unbound. Gone are the days of meticulously fine-tuning every aspect of your ride to perfection. Instead, players are left with a frustratingly constrained set of choices that fail to capture the essence of personalization that defined previous entries.

The soundtrack, while not a make-or-break aspect, also falls short of expectations. Heat's soundtrack was a pulsating symphony of beats that perfectly complemented the high-octane action. Unbound's musical choices feel uninspired and fail to elevate the gaming experience in the same way.

In conclusion, Need for Speed Unbound is a disappointing follow-up to the exhilarating Need for Speed Heat. It feels like a misguided attempt to introduce new elements to the franchise without fully understanding what made the previous installment so successful. While it's not without its merits, particularly in the visual department, Unbound ultimately falls flat, leaving fans longing for the heart-pounding excitement that defined the series' glory days.

I came back to this game nearly a year later, wanting to give it another chance, and it only made me more upset. I'm changing my review.

Do not be fooled, this game has little to do with racing. This game is about crashing into cop cars. Racing is merely the theme. Keep in mind that the driving mechanics in this game have more in common with those ""Fast & Furious"" racing cabinets you find in arcades. I'm genuinely surprised you can't double-tap your gas pedal to do a backflip during a jump in this game.

Dislikes:
- Cops spawn in your path every 10 seconds
- Being dropped into a cop chase after a race
- The grind that goes into upgrading a single car
- The forced day/night cycle, even after finishing the main story
- The limitations of the performance class event system
- At least 1 of the AI drivers in each performance class wildly out-performs that class
- The physics / handling mechanics
- Driving the same routes across the map, dodging cops, to get to the same meetup spots to do the same handful of races

Likes:
+ Visually a nice looking game
+ Runs smoothly / Good performance
+ Very stylish and unique art style
+ Lots of vehicle appearance customization options

I said it before and I'll say it again: I recommend buying NFS Heat over this.

----------------------------

[ORIGINAL REVIEW]
This game is annoying to play, and I would recommend buying NFS Heat over this entry.

Unbound isn't a ""bad"" game, but it is full of questionable design choices that have soured the formula. I've spent far more time pretending to enjoy this game than I've spent actually having fun with it. Maybe your experience will be different, but I want to present some of the things I found frustrating while playing it. In the absence of a ""Maybe"" option for my review, I'm putting it as ""Recommended"" because the game itself is playable and runs very well from day 1 (which is a rarity in the gaming industry these days).

--- Cops ---
The police chases in Unbound are obnoxious, tedious, and forced into every aspect of the game. They are no longer a tricky side option to build up some wanted levels and go on an exciting chase. When you participate in races, you gain wanted levels. While you're racing, you're being chased by cops. Even if you're racing on a closed course track... You're being chased by cops. Even if you are winning the race, and the cops are a mile behind you chasing the AI, you will still be dropped into a police chase after the race ends. Level 1 and 2 cops are fine. They obey physics, can be destroyed, and don't rubberband too much. Level 3 cops are the Corvettes, which have the worst rubberbanding i've ever witnessed in a driving game. Level 4 are Undercover units that aren't visible on the mini map to avoid. Level 5 are Heavy units which are just as agile as everything else, and will roll your car if they touch you. If you are participating in multiple races per day (which you will, because you need money), you will more often than not be at wanted level 5. They don't even pretend to try to ""find"" you, they spawn directly in your path every 10 seconds, and will spawn helicopters over Meetups, so you can't even start a race until they leave.

--- Economy ---
I love upgrading and customizing cars in these games. Unbound made upgrading so tedious that I hated getting new cars. Upgrades are specific to each vehicle, so there is no end game of having spare performance parts to throw at a new car. You are going to be spending full price on each upgrade every time. Each tier of upgrades costs money to unlock. Elite tier costs $100,000 to unlock. Each Elite part costs between $20,000 and $54,000. If you do a lot of races and are able to escape level 5 heat, you might leave each night with $100,000 profit towards the end game. The grind is real. In 26 hours of gameplay, i've not purchased a single vehicle, because I cannot afford to. I grind out races to get money, to buy paltry upgrades trying to min-max each tier of car. Races are also split into different Tiers. So you can only upgrade a car so far to keep it in a specific tier, and you need at least one car for every tier by the Grand race at the end of the month. So, once you upgrade a car as far as you can within a tier...There is no longer a reason to invest in that car. If that car wins races in that tier, that's all you need for the rest of the game. Do that for 5 cars and you're done.

--- Day & Night ---
Unbound takes Heat's day and night cycle and makes it so much worse. The main goal of the game is to complete Qualifier races at the end of each week, in order to participate in the Grand at the end of the month. Each day is split in half. You'll do races during the day, and build heat. You'll do races at night and build more heat (but you'll probably be at Heat 5 by the end of the day anyway). The part about this that sucks is that the day or night ends whenever you enter a Safehouse. Meaning that if you want to go back to the Safehouse to customize or upgrade your car, you need to sacrifice an entire half-day's worth of progress to do so. Qualifier events take place at the end of each week, and have significant entry fees to pay. Not earning all the money you can each day can be a serious problem for your progression. 

--- In Summary ---
I did not have fun with Unbound, and it pains me to admit that. It was tedious, frustrating, and I mostly continued to play it out of obligation due to the $70 price tag I paid for it. The ""Meetup"" location system is repetitive. The lack of variety of races is repetitive. The never ending police chases are repetitive. The driving physics are fickle and often unpredictable. For a game that encourages ""offroad"" use for racing and evading police, there are rock walls, lakes, and unbreakable barriers in every place you try to find a creative line. The economy adds an unnecessary grind that makes having any variety in your garage a financial nightmare to accomplish. The day-night cycle adds a time-sensitive element on top of all of the other annoying mechanics. I hope this is just an experiment with the franchise and they choose to move away from a lot of the core mechanics present in Unbound. If this is the direction they are taking this series, I'll just hold my breath until we get a true Underground 2 successor.",1670480774,1697160243,False,0,0,0.498113185167312622,0,True,False,False

Last Updated: Oct 12 2023


[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]

The Highs:
-Graphics: wow
-Customizations: Hold my bumper.
-Racing: AI are more engaging with the addition of class tiers.
-Cars: Bugatti, Urus, Countach, C8, etc... what more could you want?
-Physics & Handling: Kinda similar to Heat in some ways, but even better with grip and drift tuning.
-RSR nerfed: Not that broken anymore!
-[spoiler]Hellcat: Yeehaw!![/spoiler]
-Cops: Just better and makes more sense than Heat. In Heat, the three cop cars are okay and weak, fast and tough, faster and tougher. In Unbound, you can actually play with them by ramming, going off-road, or tricking them, but they're weak against minor collisions.

The Lows:
-Audi and Toyota: What happened to them?
-The absence of Off-Road Racing.
-Some cool small features removed, I'm not gonna get to details here.

The Mids:
-Soundtrack: At least an improvement to Heat
-Story: Longer than Heat, but it doesn't have the thrill of actually being a movie character, and the dialogues are quite cringe
-Economy: Earning money in Story is more strict, events are only available to its time in the day (For example, an A-Class Drift Race is only available in Tuesday at daytime, you won't be able to see that event at other times of the week.) Maybe they're are preventing people doing the same race over and over...
-Driving Effects: You can't completely turn them off, but it won't interfere with you when cruising at 50mph.
-Crown Vic: Not being a part of LPD, but instead of a drivable player car.

[h1]What and When to Buy:[/h1]
You should just get the Standard Edition, because the Palace cars still require in-game money to buy, they're not in your garage when you jump in. The EA App version is better because you still need the app to play the game and if you're considering buying it, it's best to buy it when it's on sale.


Conclusion:
NFS Unbound is a great base game as a whole. Since Volume 2 the game's online finally got some attention, it's an okay game in terms of story, but if you're looking for an online experience, definitely give this a try!

Volume 5 Update: I'm glad they still care about the game and community, This is the longest post-launch support we've had in NFS ever!


[h1]Some Cop Tips (If you even get this far):[/h1]

Freeroam - Avoid them by smashing, sideswiping, speeding past them (Keep in mind at higher Heat, they spot you faster), taking a different route, or by hiding with your engine off. There is also an auxiliary item called Undercover Racer, which doubles the time the cops take to spot you.


Heat 1 - Patrol Dodge Chargers: Slow and fragile, by that I mean really with 470hp, they're probably using 30% of their throttle. You can get rid of them by ramming, driving fast, or confusing them with alleyways, U-turns, and jumps.

Heat 2 - AWD Ford Explorers: Slightly faster than the Chargers, tougher, and does better off-road. You can get rid of them by again driving fast, confusing, or ramming them, but it takes longer to disable it.

Heat 3 - Interceptor Corvettes - Fast, agile, and very focused on-road, they also like to drive in front of you, giving you Burst NOS, and brake checking. You can get rid of them by ramming, driving them into traffic cars, walls, or going off-road.
Roadblocks - Blocks the road with Chargers with gaps and sometimes with spike strips, they will often crash into their own roadblocks and spikes, causing them to crash.

Heat 4 - Undercover Camaros - Hidden from scanner in Freeroam, only when it's in pursuit, and slightly slower than the Corvettes. You can get rid of them by ramming (Though they're tougher to takedown), PIT maneuvering them, or by using the Undercover Racer auxiliary part to avoid them in Freeroam.
Roadblocks - Same as Heat 3 but Chargers are replaced with Heavy Raptors
Helicopters - Sees you from the sky, takes much longer than the ground units to spot you. You can lose them from them by hiding under tunnels, obstacles, and turning off your engine, or just keep running until they run out of fuel.

Heat 5 - SWAT Ford Raptors: Toughest of the bunch, deals a lot of damage, faster than it looks, has poor handling. You can get rid of them by taking sharp turns, U-turning, swerving through traffic, until they crash, or ramming it from the back.
Roadblocks- Heavy Raptors fully blocking the road with small gaps between.
A second helicopter will sometimes be called in to assist.

The game is stunning & fresh in a genre where other titles are fairly similar. The game feels a bit unfinished and I wish they had more time to develop this.

Overall I think the game is fine. There is enough here to enjoy, but its far from being good, just above average. Get it on a sale. 6/10. To go into details though;

- The soundtrack, despite not being to everyone's tastes, mine included, works for the atmosphere the game is trying to portray.
- The physics and gameplay are an improvement from 2015, Payback and Heat, but its still waaay to unpredictable and unrealistic to enjoy on its own. None of the cars feel different from one another enough.
- The story has never been ""good"" in NFS games either, since 2012 at the very least, and this isnt any different. Its generic and uninspiring, none of the characters you care for, and theres too much politics for a street racing arcade game for my liking.
- Visuals and customisation are the best the series has seen to date. Some minor parts were cut and added later on as paid add ons, but overall the game really strives here. I spend most of my time using this game as a SEMA car build simulator, or just a way to build cool cars, rather than doing any racing.

This game is objectively worse and I'm going to go more in depth in this review, while also drawing parallels to Heat as it's a fair comparison. But for those who don't want to stick around for that long, the general gist is that this game is not bad, but disappointing and rushed. But like I said, if you want to know why I think this way keep on reading. I also discovered that the reviews have a character limit so I'll try to summarise. 

And no, it's not because of the visuals. You've had to realise by now that all the racing games look the same. The cartoony visuals is a design choice to make the game have an unique feel to it. If you go back to previous NFS titles you can see that all of them have a similar theme. With Heat it was the nightlife with an emphasis on neon lights while in comparison in Unbound it's about the underground racing scene with an emphasis on graffiti. I actually quite like how they did it. It gives you more ways to customise the car and racing becomes more animated. But in the end, it needs to be given a shot before judging, as it is unique enough to not have anything to compare it to.  

Unbound features the “burst nitrous”. Basically on top of your normal nitrous that accumulates naturally as you drive on oncoming traffic and by drifting, a second, shorter bar is present. You fill it up doing mostly the same things, drifts, airtime, basically everything else besides oncoming traffic. But the difference is that burst nitrous is way more powerful and it disappears on a timer. So you either need to use it as soon as you get it or keep the current drift to make it more powerful, so player has a choice to either use the lesser boost it gives or wait for a bigger, position-altering boost. It never feels unfair either, it’s just a mechanic I really like and makes the racing more snappy. Definitely something I wouldn’t mind in the future titles, although it doesn’t fit any realistic settings. But that’s really about all the positives I can give the game.  

Of course any NFS title wouldn’t be complete without its races. Along with cop chases that’s been their pride and joy, but they took a “different” approach here. You see, they’re [i] radiant [/i] and is the major reason I think the game is rushed. You can instigate races by driving to “meetups”, which are some derelict parking lots in different places of the map. All things aside this way of starting the races is a lot better than in Heat, where you just drove to a random place on the street. It’s in these meetups where you get to see the different races available as well as your rivals with short descriptions of them. But actually playing the races is never unique. I feel like there’s maybe ~10 different races in the entire game that just gets recycled over and over. Which makes sense in a way, the races are there to only net you money. But man, does it [b] suck [/b]. 

Completing these races is your main source of income, but it’s also the way you get heat. A race could give you from anywhere of 0,5 to 2 heat just by completing it. One of my main criticisms of Heat was because it was so night focused, it meant that the cops were dozing off on Xanax during the days. Well, that isn’t the case in Unbound. Because you get heat from races, it means you could very easily get to level 5 heat during the day, and instead of that disappearing when you get to a safehouse, it gets transferred over to the night. Only after the night will it go away. But unlike in Heat, there’s no incentive to get to those higher heat levels because it no longer acts as a money multiplier, but feels like a giant “fuck you” to the players. Heat level 5 becomes a giant slogfest if the conditions aren’t right. Because instead of the rhino from Heat, there’s now a new enforcer type at level 5. It does massive damage even it it as much as scrapes you and it can reach impossible speeds, and on top of that, it also summons Helicopters because why not. At least the helicopters aren’t just floating flood lights from Heat, and can now also instigate chases. The ways to avoid them are by going under something or by turning your car off if it’s night. Which of course, is an improvement. But because they also roam the map outside of chases you find yourself scurrying for cover or turning off your vehicle in the middle of a field all the time. 

Instead of being able to progress the game naturally like in Heat, Unbound restricts you from getting a good car. Cars are scored like they were in Heat, but there’s now a rank tied to said score. The lowest being B, the highest is S+. The races also have such restrictions, you can’t for instance roll up to a B –tier race with an A+ tier car. It makes sense. But what it also does is shackle you, because at the end of the week you’re going to need an X –tier car, no less, no more. So effectively, you’re capped at that rank. There’s no use driving an S+ car when all the races are for worse, so why would you want to upgrade your car at all past a certain point? It’s because of this that the early game is slow, both literally and metaphorically. Of course the heat system is unchanged, so you’re going to be escaping from the same ferocious cops at heat level 5 as you would in the later game, because again you need money to progress and to do that you do the repetitive races. 

The difficulty in Heat came mostly if not only from the repair stations. You only had three repairs per night or you’re bust. Accompanied with the high heat multiplier it became a skill-based high risk high reward system. So where does the intensivity come from in Unbound? I’ll tell you where, it comes from the amount of restarts you get per a day and night combo. On the easiest difficulty it’s 10 restarts, then it’s 4, then 3 on the hardest. It doesn’t take a genius to see what’s wrong with this. The gap between 10 and 4 is huge, and not only that, you get 3 restarts on the hardest difficulty while the AI opponents are trying their hardest to beat you, while on the easiest difficulty they’re just taking a leisurely stroll on the road and you get 10 attempts to pass them. Why on earth would anyone pick the hardest difficulty when it doesn’t give you more money, if anything it forces you to play more races which again, are always recycled. So it begs the question, if this is a singleplayer game with a focus on entertainment, why isn’t there an option to make a custom difficulty setting? And if you’re curious, you get free repairs in this game but only on 4 minute intervals. 

Those are my main gripes, but the unpolishedness can be seen in other things in the game as well, like bugs. For example, opening up the map while escaping from a helicopter under some cover makes it able to see you, restarting the chase. Or the fact that the map doesn’t recenter on the player, or that the minimap doesn’t know if it’s the last lap of the race. There’s just so many visible things wrong with the game it reinforces the idea that the game was pushed out to capitalise on those Christmas sales, which is a shame because Heat was a good game and Unbound had a lot of precedent to exceed it.  

But if all you want is an enjoyable driving experience akin to Need for Speed and you’ve exhausted your options, then Unbound is not a bad option. There’s still the elements in this game that makes NFS games so fun, which is why I even played it. You still get to go 400km/h in a school zone and compete in drifting events in a lamborghini. Most of the guardrails are made of cardboard while some out of adamantium. Basic things that makes the series what it is and makes it stick out from the rest. But I’m not going to pretend they didn’t do a better job with Heat, even if this improved on some of the things wrong with it. In the end you can only complete the same race so many times before it gets old when in the previous game that was a non-issue.

The Good:
- The soundtrack is very diverse to match its vibe of a multi-cultural car scene. Each track feels like it could be recommended by one of the NPCs in the single-player campaign. It gives Unbound a very international feel. Makes sense to me because car culture transcends all borders. Whether you're middle-eastern, european or north american, if you're into cars you can speak The Language.
- The original score during police chases is awesome. It's not epic or orchestral like Paul Linford's work in Most Wanted, but that style would feel incredibly dated and over-the-top here. The uptempo trap instrumentals with supersaw synths spread throughout create a lot of tension and intensity on its own, heightening the action without being a distraction.
- The car selection and car customization is best in class. No other game has this level of customization, and no other game has wild, truly exciting bodywork like Unbound does. The new unique body kits for some cars like the Crown Vic, Charger, GT-R and Silvia S14 among others are absolutely gorgeous.
- The stylized tire smoke and cel-shaded characters are neat! I just wish Criterion went whole-hog with the aesthetic and made everything cel-shaded and toony, a la Automodelista.
- The characters in the single-player are fun to love, and fun to hate. There's one particular character that many people absolutely loathe for being capital-C Cringe, but that's the whole point of her character; she's supposed to stick out like a sore thumb, becuase she's not really interested in car culture as much as she's interested in making money and chasing clout. All the characters with voice lines have their own goals and motivations like this, which makes the world feel alive.
- Multiplayer events like races, drift events, Gauntlet Events where you drive one car through three races against other drivers and the police and heat levels increase with each race while damage carries over from the previous races, and Linkups. Lots of variety here to keep the multiplayer gameplay loop from feeling stale.
- Client-side day/night time selection in Multiplayer, so if you prefer driving at night while your friends like driving during the day you can all have what you want without making a compromise.
- Beyond generalized game difficulty in single-player, you can also make the game more difficult by under-building your car for its class which increases the wagers other drivers make. If you feel like you're not getting enough money from races, try dropping your car's performance points by taking off a couple upgrades to increase driver wagers and get more money per race.
- The player voice pitch slider allowed me to perfectly tune my character's voice to match my own, to the point that friends watching me stream the game on Discord thought I was talking to them when it was actually the player character talking.

The Bad:
- The sound mixing is all over the place. The game sounds too quiet, and the engine note often gets completely overpowered by nitrous sound effects and police sirens which makes manual shifting by ear kind of difficult.
- Gamepad controls cannot be rebound. It's 2023 yall, let us bind our own controls.
- Visual glitches and CTDs are still present, though in much, much less frequency than it was upon release.
- Multiplayer party size is way too small, I often have more than four friends who want to play online together but can't.
- Some cars are just straight up weak in the online meta. The Dodge Viper is a good example, it handles like a boat twice its weight and doesn't have the top speed or acceleration to make up for it. Another example is the Crown Vic, which feels completely unusable in lower classes due to its terrible acceleration but doesn't have enough agility in the corners to be viable in higher classes either. It's a shame, because the unique body kit for the car is gorgeous.
- Drifting with automatic gearing loses a lot of speed, and makes the car feel very cumbersome. Manual gearing seems to fix this, but without controller rebinding, gear shifting and drifting requires a lot of finesse and flexibility with the fingers.

I've played this game for 320 hours now, and counting. I can confidently say this is the best Need for Speed game in years. The single-player was fun and engaging. While the pacing dragged a bit in Act 2, it wasn't as big a problem as it was in many of the games people hail as the Best In Franchise like Most Wanted or Underground 2. The characters feel dynamic and full of personality, and they're all unique from each other with their own motivations. Overall, the single-player is probably the best story-based NFS campaign in the past few years.

The multiplayer is fleshed out and feels feature complete. There are some complaints here and there like a very small party size of 4 people only and no private sessions, but the new Linkups offer a very fun change of pace from racing all the time. Drift events were also added with collisions turned off, which adds variety to event types. Criterion also added special Porsche events to celebrate 75 years of Porsche; everyone is forced to drive the same Porsche, which turns that series of races into a spec-series race. It's created some of the closest, most exciting racing I've had in an NFS game for quite some time.

Overall, I recommend this game to many people I know who feel that NFS is about attitude and atmosphere rather than flawless driving physics. I wouldn't recommend this game to people who want a modern Black Box-era NFS game, though. The Black Box era started 20 years ago and ended a decade after; people who live in the past won't enjoy the modern soundtrack nor the appeal to the Generation Z demographic. I'm 30 and sometimes felt old when the millennial father figure was making references to memes I would be familiar with but the younger crowd would likely see as an Old Person Joke, but I could at least laugh at myself for it. People who idolize Most Wanted and Underground, well... they probably won't appreciate being reminded they're old.",1676929022,1696519985,True,5,1,0.516764223575592041,0,True,False,False

Police can catch up to any car at anytime your maximum speed and even reach 400km/h.

Radio in this game is silly and annoying, but there is no volume control for that, as its seen as normal dialogues which as i found out, are useful to actually hear if its a car mission, or just a stupid side race.

Unlocking of additional hideouts and certain cars is behind random missions which is quiet annoying, and at certain point they get locked down for half of the game... Money hold close to no value since you often cannot use them for a longer while due to how limited you are with access to new cars behind missions, random events and tweaking your cars is also limited by ""Tier"" that you currenly are on.

Game is cut into 4 segments, 5 days and night cycles each, you can do up to 5 races per cycle but unlimited side objectives, collectibles and stunts for extra money, which can lead to reaching the target cash before finals, which.... Forces you to still go through each cycle and you cannot skip it unless you earn some cash...

The begining of the game is more unfair than end game, as due to enemies cheating, you are twice at disadvantage, while grand finale was the easiest race i had to play.

Physics, mechanics and traction in this game is weird, as with street wheels you will slip on offroads and limit your speed very harshly, and with offroad wheels you will be slower on roads, there is also ""Neutral"" option that just keeps you at where your car is mostly, which does not really help, i believe this mechanic to be overtweaked by developer, and problematic as it only affects the player, not the NPC's.

Driving some of those cars during races feels like driving a car that has no engine but instead is just a bicycle, as during free roam i noticed that some cars drive faster and drift better, so something odd is going on there.

Rendering distance is hideous even on maximum settings, cars appear out of nowhere, effects do not load in field of view, even hot pursuit from 2010 didn't had such limitations, and it was made for consoles.

If you are not in age range between 10-14 years old, then i wouldn't pay more than 5$ for this game.
DLC's do not have dubbing, while entire game does....

There is only 7 racing locations, and you will race on the same spots, in same places in different forced by game tiers of cars against same racers.

After some time the game did not allow me to go online. Not sure if servers have been taken down, or if i got shadow banned for playing single player out of blue, but i will add that as another reason why this game is not worth any of your money.

Oh yes, and music is garbage, maybe one tune is bearable, had to mute all the music, but the playlist is hardcoded into the game, so you will be getting pop ups with titles even if its muted...

Lately i see more and more additional purchase DLC's showing up on steam for this game that grant you access to additional 1 car and some tuning functions, and with them, random update of 30GB for this game even if you did not purchase anything. Another reason to dislike this game.

Also, feels overly similar to NFS Heat. That for a moment there i wasn't sure if i ran the wrong game.

It was the Ferrari of racing games, the Lamborghini of virtual speed demons, and the Bugatti Veyron of adrenaline-pumping gameplay. But like a souped-up car without brakes, it seems that the Need for Speed franchise has taken a turn for the absurd.

**Gameplay**

Remember the days when you could actually control your car in Need for Speed games? Ah, those were simpler times. In ""Need for Speed: Unbound,"" it's more like your car has a mind of its own and is on a mission to collide with everything in its path. The controls are so wonky that it's like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel through rush-hour traffic.

But the real comedy show begins when you engage in a high-speed chase. It's as if the cops in the game have a secret agenda to show off their ballet skills, pirouetting and twirling their cars like they're auditioning for ""Dancing with the Stars"" instead of trying to catch you. If you're lucky, they might even do a synchronized drift routine that would put a Broadway musical to shame.

**Stories**

Now, let's talk about the story. In the good old days, NFS stories were about underground racing, betrayal, and street cred. But in ""Unbound,"" the story is so over the top that it makes a soap opera look like a documentary. You play as Max Speedster, an undercover racer turned secret agent who's out to stop a global criminal syndicate. Yes, you read that right – a racer turned secret agent. James Bond, eat your heart out.

As you progress through the story, you'll encounter characters with names like ""Nitro Nick"" and ""Turbo Tina,"" who seem to exist solely for the purpose of making terrible car-related puns. The dialogue is so cheesy that it could fill a thousand pizzas, and the plot twists are so predictable that even a toddler could see them coming from a mile away.

**Graphics**

And finally, let's talk about the graphics. In the golden age of NFS, the graphics were like a feast for the eyes – sleek, shiny cars racing through beautifully detailed cityscapes. But in ""Unbound,"" it's more like a trip through a Salvador Dali painting. The cars have the aerodynamics of a brick, and the cities look like they were designed by a kindergarten class armed with crayons and cardboard.

The weather effects are equally absurd. Raindrops the size of watermelons splatter your windshield, and when it's foggy, you can barely see the road in front of you. It's like the game is trying to simulate the experience of driving blindfolded through a hurricane while juggling flaming torches.

In conclusion, ""Need for Speed: Unbound"" is a rollercoaster ride of absurdity that will leave you scratching your head and wondering what happened to the once-great franchise. But hey, if you're in the mood for a good laugh and some unintentional comedy, it might just be the game for you. Just don't expect to find any actual speed or a coherent story along the way.

Let's get the worst points out of the way first.

Story:
It. Just. Sucks. I hate it. The story has no depth, antagonist being Yaz, Tess, or even Alec, is unknown to this day. The story just screams money, money, money; even the some of the soundtrack is about it. It doesn't make sense, there is no depth on characters, backstory, character origin, nada. It felt so shallow. Not just that, A$ap Rocky, the guest character, just acts as an activity host, rival and, that was it? He doesn't contribute much or even at all to the story, and is a waste of time and money. If he wasn't there, it wouldn't affect the story.

Art:
Straight up ripped off from ""Into the Spider Verse"", it almost felt like a carbon copy, but I love it personally. It is fresh, inspiring and just out of the world kind of level of special and iconic. If nowadays we're talking about racing games, the first thing that comes out would be this game. Though great, the visuals could be distracting for some, and I really wish there is an option to opt out the visuals; but it would also remove the main selling point of the game.

Gameplay:
The gameplay mechanic really revolutionizes the racing scene, and giving more depth and options for different types of racers. However, the balancing is kinda leaning towards grip, giving more rewards than drifting. Drifting is a downgrade from NFS Heat, and I would really do anything to bring that back. Other than that though, the diversity of driving really helps people to master different styles of racing, and Criterion really did it almost perfectly.

Quality of Life:
The garage itself is an upgrade from Heat, giving it a more realistic, typical garage look, BUT, really didn't give the option to expand the visuals more. The only option is to just direct you to the style and performance sections, or just to race. I would really love to explore to garage, or wanting the option to put more cars in it, which what Heat had in their previous garage. 

The Online Multiplayer and Story progression separation really baffles me. It really felt like I have to play the game twice, and really demotivates me personally that I almost wanted to stop playing after finishing the story, which it was bad on its own. It is more acceptable when money was easier to earn in Online, as the story mode only rewards you more on S+ class races. For me, I would like the money system to be spread evenly towards all car classes, so you can race in any race class for equal rewards.

VERDICT:
Overall, it was almost a great racing game, with amazing depth and captivating visuals, but really ruined it with its lackluster story and separated progression. I would not recommend paying full price for the game and really go for the discount. Also, don't buy the Palace Edition. I don't think it's worth buying. Other than that, if you're interested with the visuals, I think it's worth giving it a try.

Online has some graphic shananigans, cars missing body parts or being see-through.
Also, a couple cars have disappeared a couple times. Repurchased it and a couple days later they're gone again.

Some things I've encountered with the driving physics:
If you get into late game,  with high grip vehicles. Cars will have trouble turning tight radius corners. Once you drift and catch grip again, you will shoot off track whichever direction you are pointing at that moment.. High speed and driving uphill will sometimes glitch the camera into the asphalt. cars will start bouncing uncontrollably if you are off-road and, slowing you down untill it stops.

So while I recommend the game to play the story mode didn't last long and the online has some frustrating bugs.

- As of the Vol 4 patch, the new Porsche Taycan was released which required a pinch of grinding to unlock. However, after a week of owning that car, it is now gone from my garage. Not only my Taycan, but my friends Taycans as well. Apparently the Maybach vanished from peoples garages too. Fortunately, I bought mine late. I still have it but I'm pretty sure I'm not getting that Taycan back and may lose my Maybach (combined value of $1.5 million dollars) or some other cars I use and took time to make drivable which brings me to my next gripe. Oh also there's a few other cars like the Lotus Exige and the Lamborghini Countach that have straight up missing body panels. They have yet to fix these issues as of writing this.

- The cars in game probably drive super sloppy compared to older titles. Yes you can make some of them drive pretty decent if you take your time. Some more than others. But overall, the cars will over pitch themselves sometimes into turns and massively oversteer. Not sure why. All my cars are super bouncy as well. It's quite Irritating at times. It doesn't really stop me from winning online races but it sometimes feels like a chore pushing your cars on here.

- This game has been crashing a lot on me since the Vol 4 patch. Nothing like finishing an event that pays you 120k or about to cross the finish in an online event your dominating just to get a crash to desktop so you completely miss out on your cash and/or challenge requirements. This did not happen before this patch. 

- Some cars have a balancing issue. Basically if you are in an S+ race (highest tier) and some dude online has a Koenigsegg Regera, and you don't, unless bro can't drive, you're going to lose. I can slap just about anyone in S+ but never that car. It's a small gripe of mine ( I personally don't care that much) but it may put new players off getting constantly gapped by the same car EA just saying.

- Speed is tied to frame rate and this game LOVES to grind to a crawl during online races. This is something that has been much more prominent with the latest patch. Quite annoying. These lag spikes will sometimes make you crash or spin out as well. Its definitely a server issue, Then again, its EA so big surprise there. 

- The story is short. Like real short. I finished it in like 6 days or so I believe? And that's me not really playing the heck out of it. The way the story is structured, you have to build a new tier car every week or so for the event coming on Saturday to compete. Which means, you better pick wisely and learn how to tune somewhat decently fast because the AI in this game is on your cheeks pretty heavy no matter what you do. Especially when you get to S+ and Mr. Japanese Ferrari Man shows up in the Justin Bieber LaFerrari to spread ya cheeks so far apart each ones gonna have a different area code on them. 

- People complain about the cops in here. Yes they can totally make you lose a race but tbh most of their complaining is a skill issue. Its not that hard getting away from the cops even with a low level car and high heat.

To sum it up, it's not a bad game. Its not great either. It's just okay. I know I have like 100 hours on this shush. I will still continue to play it for now unless these issues don't get fixed or get worse. The online issues is whats putting me off at the moment with this game. If you wanna buy this game I HIGHLY recommend to wait till its on sale. Its not worth 60 bucks.",1695858858,1695858858,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So many annoying bugs, such as unable to customize online character, cars disappear in lobby with no reason and need to buy and customize the car again. The gameplays of PVP racing is frustrating. Cars not balance, only the EA blessed cars can make you win your opponents. The AI in the game is evil, the NPC polices car appear in front of you just to make sure you lose from 1st place to 8. Race v design is poor, map design also, the racing map size is just way too small. Too many traffics and obstacles make bad racing experience, you just can't chill. This is VOL.4, still so much problems and bugs which is totally unacceptable, Bugs keep annoying you, It seems the creators of the game already forget what need for speed game is like, the only things they don't forget is the fkin WOKE culture, Its been putting in the game everywhere. Forget about the WOKE ShXts, please focus on making good games. The only good things of this game is ramming, you can easily ram or get ram from players on PVP mode. Wining races only make you feel bad, losing also. It just don't make you feel good at any point. You can easily win by ramming or using overpowered unbalance cars to win your opponents 1000+ miles aways. You lose it the same way too. EA Criterion Games, CAPCOM, UBISOFT is now on my blacklist.

The bad parts about it:

-It's soundtrack, probably this has been mention hundreds of times but it's just god awful.
-Some parts from previous games got removed (an example would be the C-West front bumper for the R34, the one that Ty has in NFS Payback)
-A lot of recycled cars from previous games

The gameplay, how you earn money, how you save, how races organized and how you have to keep in mind economy - this is the best thing I needed from racing arcade recently. Especially after Forza Horizon where cars are poured at you like September rain, here you feel like you EARN your money. 

The way you can customise your care are mind-blowing. All those body-kits, I never seen anything like this in a racing game. If you need a game where you want to build a connection with your ride, where you can race to earn to customise — this is the game. 

But you won't enjoy it. Because Payback or Heat on normal difficulty setting feels like a joke to what here is called ""relaxed"". RELAXED! If I were to relax like this, I would play Darksouls for ultimate ""relaxation"". But really, the game has some difficulty problem. I am adequate arcade racer, played almost all NFSs from Underground and up, and never had to struggle like here. In terms of difficulty it feels like you are playing racing sim game while AI opponents play something like Asphalt with auto-win button.

The soundtrack is not for me. Don't know, I can see how stupid boys in trash cars play this soundtrack on max loudness under my window at night while standing and chatting, but it won't give you anything close to those goosebumps you feel when speed up in Underground 2 or MW.

the car customisation in this game is so good and so much fun with it being way more in depth then previous NFS games and don't even get me started on the legendary custom kits those things are so f**king awesome it was probably the biggest reason i got all the achievements since i really wanted that legendary BMW M1 kit.

the racing is good i mean its a NFS game can't really mess up a bunch of cars heading from point A to point B the only thing is the way they redid the handling of cars and how they drive in this game is weird. like some cars i find are just completely garbage until you find a mix of handling tuning and mods that work with that vehicle. for instance  the Ford Crown Vic, i wanted to get all the legendary kits for the cars and some of the cars you have to use to get their kits are horrible like the crown vic till i made a build that had it putting on max grip tires, road suspension then tuning the handling to 20% drift. speaking of drifting, you can drift really easily and smoothly in this game AFTER you get the hang of it and get some experience drifting in this game otherwise your going to try drifting and go ""what the f**k is going on?"" its wonky the way they did drifting in this game. or on the other hand you could just slam your car to 100% grip and race in this game like a street version of an F1 Sim which me personally found to be worse then just drifting corners just because its broing {plus it doesn't look or feel as cool}

overall id give it a 8/10. its a good game but it suffers from what i see as them trying to change TOO much all at once though the updates to the multiplier have made it a ton better the handling of cars  and the lack of  an actual need to get the cops to chase you leave something to be desired plus a lot {not all} but a good amount of songs in this game are complete booty cheeks i actually just played youtube or music on my computer at 20% volume in the background and muted the ingame music because it was just not good anyway that's my take buy it or don't but in the end i would recommended it thank you for reading.",1695535691,1695535691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The only problem I encountered with the game are incorrectly named difficulty levels. 
For me, ""Relaxed"" should be renamed to ""Challenging"", and ""Challenging"" should be renamed to ""Punishing"". 
Either I suck at this real hard (I didn't have any issues in Heat) or the Challenging difficulty is a total nightmare at least from the beginning of the game. So yes, if you are asking, for now I play on the easiest difficulty expecting to ramp it up once this *broke AF* period is over. With that setting, the races are just enough of a challenge to be fun but not overly frustrating - and the same goes for the police. 
I recommend you do the same, to get a good grip on how the game works, how the power levels are set up, and how to get the most out of your nitrous. 
- Speaking of broke, you are really short on money the first two weeks, especially if you buy a car you end up not liking like me and losing most of your hard-earned cash trying to get another one. Select your rides carefully. Any exchanges will be painful in the first ~20 hours. 

Pros:
- I love that the game took over the best approaches from Heat, and honestly reminds me of the best of the Underground and Most Wanted games in one game with beautiful, beautiful graphics. 
The city, the cars and the game looks really amazing most of the time. 
Plus, believe it or not, I am 33 years old, and I don't hate the art style and the goofy effects. I have no problem with them. Yes, I was like wtf seeing the first videos online, but when playing, they do give the game a nice punch, visually.
- The arcade driving model works great to entertain and if you liked the previous installments, you will like this game (I will never get why somebody would hate on NFS not being a sim, a criticism I see a lot of the time). The guys from Speedhunters have obviously gotten a lot of space for input in the past couple installments, and so the game tries to cater to your preferences, regardless of whether you want to drift, drive the racing line, or play the game like a mobile racer game. Make sure you visit the driving settings not just to adjust the handling to how you would like to play: for example, I hate the one-button drifts, I want to play the racing line as much as I can, and therefore I set all my cars for maximum grip, turn off stabilization, and turn off all the one tap nonsense. 

Missed opportunities:
- It's a bit of a pity that there are almost no recent cars in the game. To name a few, I am missing the BMW M4 Competition (G82), Porsche 911 992s, Ferrari F12, Monza, SF90, etc. There are also no Audis and Toyotas (! - no Supra, old or new).  

Verdict:
- The game is pretty entertaining for me. First I tried it through EA Play with the 10 hour trial, and I spent that time in two days. I was also quite surprised it was one of the few games that ran perfectly on launch date. Since I went over the trial period quickly, I waited, and as the game is finally on sale now I bought it for 20 bucks and already put in another 11 hours in it in one day - which should tell you how fun it can get. For that price, I think the game is actually quite amazing and gives me a lot of nostalgic NFS fun. 

P.S.:
- I have still yet to try the multiplayer mode - hoping I will talk some friends into the game while it is still on sale. Will report back if I do. So far the experience has been strictly single player for me.",1684405861,1695453273,True,2,0,0.531737744808197021,0,True,False,False

Annoying Forza Horizen like Tier System wich FORCES u to race in ur teir.
Annoyingly big prices to entre a lot of races and a LIMETATION OF RETRAIs for races, that ONLY reset on next day. 
Speaking of the day-night sycle is very annoying.

Also the 2d effects and genshin like charactor don´t fit with the ulra realistic feel and looks of the cars. 

Altoug I like the idea of more unrealistic ""Cartoony"" looks for a nfs thats not supposed to be realistic but just fun action paced racing. But it just tries to be realistic everywhere.

Overall an okay game but such a downgreat from Heat (I played it to 100%) and unfortinatly to many stressfull and anoying things to be really enjoyable.

Bad:
1: Don't bother buying it and playing with a wheel, no way to change the controls, the steering is way off even on 0% dead zone.
2: Really hard if not impossible at times to start the ""hand break"" making drifting impossible, little customisation when it comes to controls as well, not many things can be changed to make the experience better.

Graphics-wise the world looks quite good and cars look amazing, Some people didn't like the effects and you can deactivate the majority of them but I don't think that should be a problem, the game feels much better with them.

Regarding gameplay, it's a bit complicated, there's rubber banding and the AI gets crazy sometimes, more common on higher levels. The tier system was nice to experiment with, but you gotta spend a lot of time and in-game money to set up the perfect car, personally I didn't hate or love it, just meh, not my kinda thing. I have to note that something I definitely missed from heat was the day/night system and the fact that there were no police chases on day. Because police on Unbound are really though when you start and just become a nuisance on the higher levels. But other than that, pretty good.

I like to go for 100% on games and most of the time while it is a long task it's not something I would complain about, but boy, drift activities/challenges on this game were the worst, should be called wiggle activities instead, hated them, but are doable, just something I wanted to note for the completionists out there.

The story was relatively good, a bit more enjoyable than Payback and maybe on par with Heat, but as usual, it's a racing game, you don't come here for the story.

There are still a few bugs here and there and I definitely think it needs more optimization, not sure about this but I read somewhere that it has a memory leak, and sometimes you'll get polygons everywhere making it impossible to see, happened to me once, restarted the game and never saw it again, so keep that in mind.

And much to my surprise, it's pretty rare to see people meta-abusing certain cars. Most races can be won with a good tune (aside from B and S+ class which rely more heavily on the car itself than the upgrades). The seemingly tedious challenges to unlock cars (in online) have actually done a great job keeping me engaged with the game for this long, as without them, I don't think I would have kept playing as much.

I did not expect this. I'm from an age where NFS Most Wanted (2005) reigned supreme as the best 2000+ NFS game. I loved Porsche Unleashed and High Stakes before that. NFS Underground introduced car tuning at a completely different level and was a very good game in general, later Hot Pursuit (2010) reintroduced the gameplay of NFS's of the prior age and was an excellent game as well. The other NFS's somehow came short on something every time. It was either a bad port (Undercover), horrid story (NFS 2015), weird world and handling (NFS Rivals) or just a bad gameplay loop in general (Most Wanted 2012 and Heat) and the lack of cops in my NFS's (Payback, Shift, ProStreet, even Underground for that matter).

Then came the scetchiest of all NFS's - Unbound and it somehow took the lead.

I haven't had so much fun in a NFS since Most Wanted. This is a most excellent game.
It has a good gameplay loop - you have races during day and night, where each has some benefits, the gameplay loop is tied to the story which is subtle and you don't need just the one car to beat everything. You need 4 tiers - A, A+, S and S+ to beat the final stage in the game and you use these cars throughout the story if you choose to. There is also a B tier and even though you still have events for B tier cars, it's not obligatory to finish the game.
The cops are not over the top and whilst it's unlikely you will have a 6+ police car chase on your tail it's still exciting and fun to try and lose them. The game puts you under pressure from the start and does not let go.
Multiplayer is fun, while there are some cars that require nerfs, like the Ferrari Pista or Koenigsegg Agera, maybe even the old Golf, it has been a good experience overall.

My only two gripes are the music and vanity visual effects.
Some music tracks seem to fit the mood of the game pretty well, especially the more energetic ones, however the pop and hip-hop songs - they are just boring and they get old very fast. The lack of DNB and rock music also hits home. I liked the option to disable specific songs in some older NFS's, but muting them is also an option.
The visual effects are possibly one of the most talked about issues in the game. While they don't brake the game and they do add some flavor to the whole thing, for the most part I've found them to be annoying. These effects obstruct the view too much. A simple visibility slider would easily fix that.

All in all I like this game a lot. I would be stoked to see a DLC that adds more missions to the single player and also adds more races and cars to the multiplayer.

I do recommend this. 8/10",1670843873,1694797513,True,56,3,0.722641527652740479,5,True,False,False

The main story is lackluster and cringe-inducing, while A$AP Rocky's appearance feels like a marketing gimmick (FYI: from what I have read, EA just got A$AP to rant about some random crap in an interview and used snippets of that 10 minute long rant throughout the story. If you finish the game, the credits just play the entire audio clip of A$AP rambling, and if you're lucky enough, you get to hear it twice in a row). 

Multiplayer's excessive grind and the prevalence of AFK racers are major annoyances. The game also simplifies race types and dumbs down the day/night gameplay loop compared to its predecessor, Need for Speed: Heat. On the positive side, it retains Heat's car selection and visual customization, offers a unique stylistic approach, and introduces an improved boost system.

I was also pleasantly surprised that they had a decent selection of cars in this game, as usually its pretty bare bones. The new takeover events are kind of cringe, but also an easy way to make money, and I enjoyed the rival system and giving you characters that you can actually get to know instead of random names on a board.

I actually was moved to leave this review because I was just on my 100th try of beating the last race in the grand, and finally after a flawless run with no traffic collisions or magical cops with heat seeking precision, I was tail taped by an undercover who magically appeared next to me, just before the finish line, got slowed down like 10mph, and the AI somehow flew by me at the speed of sound to clinch the victory from me. It was also my last restart (WHICH IS THE WORST FEATURE EVER, WHY MAKE LIMITED RESTARTS?!?!?!?!?!?!) my jaw dropped, and I stared at the screen for 15 minutes, before laughing, then convulsing in anger. 

Whoever thought that giving the AI the ability to transcend speed and time to catch up to you was a good difficulty idea, was not loved enough by their parents.

This game wants to hurt you, it doesn't want you to have a good time, it just pure torture.",1694358880,1694358880,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

(Need for Speed pros and cons)

Cons : Game features are restricted like racing in events where you have to race against your own tier your car rating. If you're S+ trying to race S tier rating, you won't be able to. This is based off street racing so why does it have legal professional rules? 

You have a limit for restarting your game, if you're a perfectionist that's a big ouch.

I am a visual guy so I enjoy high quality graphics, Unbound graphics could use some work not gonna lie, I don't mind the comic book pop up graphics but the environment needs some tweaking, mainly plants .

Pros: Racing mechanics are interesting, it's not bad, the fact that you can tune your vehicle gives it a slight simulation feel to racing. 

Overall I wouldn't pay full price for this game, it will rub you off and not in a good way. The restrictions and economic system is not to my liking it's terrible to implement a new system that only raise stress levels.

The racing is fun, but the the game design is just frustrating.
I have put over 800 hours into NFS Heat which I love, but this game is just not nearly as fun.

You are forced to play the game they the developers created and anything else results in making you feel bad for playing the game.

You want to race? well you can't unless the game says you can and how it wants you to play

You want to do a street race? well you can't because you don't have the right car, or the race available is only to go in circles knocking over things instead of racing.

You want to do races? well do you have the enough money for the buy in that is half the payout?

You want to get better cars? well you get around $3000 a race but the cheapest cars that are not from 1950 are around $30,000.

Your forced to throw all your money into upgrades and hope you can squeak by for the weekend race that the game forces you to play for while doing activities the game forces you to play.

In online mode, I have been forced to use a rental car instead of my actual car to race, which is annoying and feels really REALLY bad. Then you have to race 3 races (playlists) as activities. This seems completely unnecessary and pointless, and takes away from the fun of just driving. Each race that you don't have a matching tier car in your garage for requires that you race using a rental car of that tier instead. Its like they took the best parts of the game and force you to play the way the game designers want you to play instead of actual focusing on making the game fun. (what a concept, I know.) I recognize maybe I'm just not used to the new game style compared to Heat, but just not having fun.

It is possible to race without using rental cars, but to do this you need to grind out the money to have all the cars in your garage for each tier. Games that force you to grind seem like poor game design rather than just playing the game while having fun and getting money that way. Heat handled this well too so it's not like they don't have previous experience to learn from.

The story so far seams more about setting up one snarky passive aggressive comment after another rather than anything else. It's still early though so I'm willing to put up with it for now, but my expectations are low.

Drifting in Unbound doesn't seem as good as NFS Heat,

Not even worth the 70% discount at the Palace Edition sale price of 23.99 USD. This is by far the worst EA game that I have ever played in my entire life; coming from a veteran of the NFS franchise itself. This completely changed my opinion of Heat, which is a much more enjoyable and playable game than this dumpster fire of a game. Story mode has a few rare moments of glory that are completely tattered by other lame NPC dialogue or events... The car system is completely broken, especially when one has to worry about restarting with a brand new car, trying to get that car to even compete against the AI with maxed out cars for that tier (pretty convinced that some are allowed to use higher tier cars than the player is). NFS Heat was simplified where the player still progressed through a range system of ratings rather than having to make ten thousand cars for different purposes. Also, having restarts limited to two in single-player is often frustrating as I enjoy trying to better myself through fixing mistakes that I made on the previous attempt of the event. I understand that limiting restarts in events ties into the risk and reward system, but I simply do not care. The reason for me not caring about the risk versus reward system is that the cops in this game are pathetic at best. Easy to manipulate, escape, and completely ignore cops in this game. 

I wish I went with the reviews on this one, but I wanted to give it a fair shot being a super NFS fan. What a let down. 

One positive, maybe, is the dynamics of customization that is afforded to the player for purchased cars.

Music taste in this game is also horrible, but that is on a subjective matter only (everyone has their style of music). I do not mind rap in a racing game, but it would be nice to have a variety of ""race worthy"" music to feel energized to. Most of the songs, if all, are not memorable to me and do not provide me with an adequate feel for ambiance that I love in other games. Even the tracklist in NFS Heat wasn't that bad (lots of catchy or fitting songs that also adjusted per day or night).

Day and night cycle in this game is not that bad itself. The one big positive about the day cycle is that it allows for more cop gameplay and other events to take place versus the older system implemented in NFS Heat.

1. Its a slow game than NFS Heat. I miss the sense of speed.
2. Handling sure is alright
3. Multiplayer is by far the most boring. I miss being chased by cops. Even after the race
and more.

I have suggestions how they can make this a bit more fun

1. Bring the day/night system to multiplayer (Same as NFS Heat or Unbound Single Player) 
2. Bring back heat level Multiplier (I don't like grinding hours of gameplay and just get some parts and my money is gone)
3. After a race in the middle of the playlist make us as if we have to race to the next location of the next race. And continue a cop chase even after a race to get that Butt Clenching moments just like in Heat.

I'm not saying this game is super bad. It has potential. But right now at this time. Its pretty bad. In my opinion if they do add the things i suggested I would go back to the game and play alot more.",1694099476,1694099476,False,2,0,0.51086956262588501,0,True,False,False

The difficulty is like that of NFS MW 2012 or maybe harder, I should git gud or EA should give balancing updates. I didn't know that I just bought a souls-like racing game. 
The cops are also everywhere after you gain more than 1 heat level, you will be driving, hiding and dodging cops in which can be assisted by the use of your map radar. Also after you escape the cops, looking at your map radar where cops are patrolling everywhere makes you feel like playing a pac-man game with high-end graphics.

Otherwise, the game is fine, if you like NFS heat then you'll probably like this game too. The soundtrack is not that bad if you enjoy listening to mainstream and current trend songs, if not, then Spotify does exist brudda. As for the visual effects and anime-style characters, I personally love it as they give a fresh feel to the current racing game market.

For handling, who cares? It's a need for speed, an arcade racing game anyway. The handling is more varied than NFS Heat for e.g in NFS Heat you can drift with any car but not in Unbound.

And they really messed up online... My buddies and I LOVED going for black market (whatever they´re called) and were genuinely worried ab the cops catching us. 
Unbound doesn´t even really have cops online. There are some in events, but not nearly as many in free roam. You have to provoke them to start a chase

It's more fun to play that to watch gameplay footage of, that's fs. It would be more impressive if it came out of an indy studio but since it's EA/NFS realistically expectations are gonna be at the highest level. For the most part it's a unique driving experiences because of the handling, graphics and post FX. One thing they keep getting wrong removing choice from the player esp. where there's no game mechanic in danger.[/b]

I'll be updating this review after I beat the game. But for now - dig in:
EDIT: Updating after 2 more hours, and a 20 min forced cop chase that only escalated by me following the game's advice (don't race this car, take it down) and it went from a almost heat 3 back to heat 4 and ultimately heat 5. It was too much for my B car to handle at that point. Problem is, the game PUTS YOU IN A CHASE automatically after the race, even if you're not followed by any cops, or in the middle of any kind of in-race chase. That's the bullshit. Lost some good money and likely the lst 40 + min of racing making it an hour wasted. 10/10 would do it again. LMAOOO plot twist!! I actually like the challenge, and I will make it my mission to watch a youtube tutorial and plan my escapes more carefully from now on. One more thing I really like about this NFS is the fact you don't have to be 1st, in fact the game / life goes on adn you're just a broke bum with a dream. There's also no way to reset the story (I wanted to when I noticed - SPOILER ALERT -- SPOILER ALERT -the prologue takes your money away - just spend it all on clothes!!!) which makes it sorta permadeath and follows the letting-you-fail vibe. Makes wins matter that much more imo. Frustrating? sure. Outdated UX? Sure. Still playing? Yup! [/EDIT] 

In light of all the mixed reviews I was keeping an eye out for this game since like June, July. I knew it's gonna need to be a deep discount purchase and seeing the 70% it felt like it's about as ""full price"" as I'm willing to go for it.  Long story short It's doing just enough to keep me interested and will more than likely make up for my $20. Gameplay is smooth, decent pace, customization is cool but not bountiful. Soundtrack is a bit hit (Black Thought) and miss (bulgarian trap?drill?) but it nails the vibe (I toned it down to 50% so it's basically bg noise). 
Sound design (not to be confused with soundtrack) is at the forefront for me. Second are the graphics, feels slightly richer (but like 5%) than Heat, and I also like the FX I feel like within these 2h out of which likely 1h was the racing thing I didn't see them too much. One thing I did was not play on the hardest difficulty but on Challenging  (mid option) since I saw all the cop chase complaints. So far I have only had 2 star encounters and it's been a joke (drive in any direction for 15-25 sec). Can confirm, heat level drops after each day passes so that's neat.   
You can't customize your characters eye, eyebrow color and voice - not to mention face. There are around 10 (prolly less) average body types to pick from. I wish we were given at least 2-3 options in height and weight as well. 
Overall my verdict is get the game on sale, test drive it for 2h and make your own mind. You might be surprised if you go into it not expecting anything. Talk soon",1694028228,1694039413,True,1,0,0.520792186260223389,0,True,False,False

I really want to like this game and recommend it, because Unbound has all the hallmarks of a good current-era NFS. A lot of those good gameplay elements were obviously borrowed from Heat, which may not be the most original solution, but at least the developers/publishers have been drip-feeding us new content with the vol. 2/3/4 updates.

So all should be well now, shouldn't it? Well, in theory, yes. In practice, not so much. The glaring issue is the glitches, which only seem to have gotten *worse* after every major update. The majority of the glitches seem to be within the shop and inventory systems, and they're potentially game-breaking for the affected cars (some cars get lots of glitches while others get none at all). We're talking items failing to purchase, items failing to equip, vanishing or mismatched UI elements, menus freezing and crashing the game back to your desktop... Forums are riddled with similar horror stories of glitches, with no feasible fixes in sight. Verifying files or even reinstalling the game are not verified solutions for most glitches, so players are at wit's end...

Initially, the glitchiness caught me by surprise, as the developer (Criterion) doesn't really have a reputation for creating products this glitchy. My suggestion? Don't purchase Unbound unless the developers manage to do something about the sorry state the game is in right now.

Unbounds racer ai is actually a bit more challenging compared to heat where you can leave the ai racers in the dust with ease. cops though are a bit of a 180 compared to the racers. The handling model and physics are ok. they brought back pedestrians  which added to the immersion. and the graphics are really good especially the rain effects. though i'm honestly disappointed with the story. i thought the story was a bit lack luster and cringy. the characters are mid at best. and some downright cringy. compared to heat (in my opinion) the story was way more thought out and had better characters and atmosphere(though unfortunately cut way too short). the map felt like it didnt fit the game. and they locked Eddies skyline, Joe's polestar from heat, and the 350Z from underground 2 BEHIND A PAYWALL LIKE TF THEY WERE FREE IN THE LAST GAME SO WHY LOCK THEM BEHIND A PAYWALL EA???

I don't game much these days so I have nothing to go off for NFS in recent years. I think the last one I played was Hot Pursuit. Yes, I'm old lol. I've been playing Rocket League because I usually like sports games, but I needed a change. And this one was on sale. 

Anyway, This game has definitely impressed me so far. No, it's not the same as Midnight Club in terms of the Rockstar-esque style and energy. But it comes damn close and is in the same vein of playful, ghetto street ambiance. The whip customization and variance between driving styles is a huge perk for replay-ability. You have a huge stock of free cars to play with as you go through the game. Paint and decals are free! So $ can be saved for actually upgrading cars. Love that. And the graphics are insanely good. Cops are tough, but not impossible. The radio jammer fixes their annoyance immediately. 

A lot of people on here complaining about things like replay limit and cops which is kinda weird. Maybe just get better at the game and adapt to it. I think like all review sections, this one is rife with entitled no-lifers who always have something to complain about. There has clearly been a lot of energy put into this revamp of a game and it's sad to see so many people hating it cuz it's different.

I will say that some of the abrasive sound design choices are a little distracting and over the top. Specifically the start screen chaos every time you play the game. I hate that I have to spam the X/A button to not hear that noise pollution. But for real, that's maybe my only complaint. That and the fact Audi is not in the mix. I love Audi's. Cant' have em all I guess.

All in all, I'm happy that this game was made at a time when I was looking to get back into racing games. It sure beats Gran Turismo 1, where I basically raced my fully upgraded Dodge Viper in circles for hours and hours with the dullest soundtrack you've ever heard. And that game was considered revolutionary... You kids don't know how good you got it nowadays.",1693841251,1693841378,True,25,2,0.619500577449798584,0,True,False,False

Game mechanics are good especially the drift vs grip mechanic. Means you need to plan your garage rather than just maxxing out every stat. There's strategy in terms of balancing money vs heat vs time. There is open world stuff to do however I prefer the races and didn't care much for collecting 50x mcguffins.

Racing is different to earlier titles but not worse. Just different. The cops are smarter now so you can't just bump and handbrake to get away. You need to lean more into using the world to your advantage. Also I think the AI racers you compete against seem to have distinct driving styles? I might be imagining it.

This is the most difficult of the NFS that I can remember. I started on Intense and was out of my depth. I turned it down to Challenging and was struggling even with that. Especially once you reach max heat and the cops are all over you makes it impossible to bank cash. I was scum saving in the garage after 3 heats and progress was slow. With some embarrassment turned it down to Relaxed.  

Technical issues. Even a few months in it's still buggy as all heck. Texture pop is atrocious and my gaming PC is no slouch (7900XTX). I turned the settings down to Medium to try and avoid the worst of it. Even still there's some stuttering and it texture flickers sometimes. Loading screens are painfully slow even on a Samsung 970. Frostbite is a bad engine.

The music is the worst part of the game. Had to set the music volume to 0% because it's intolerable garbage and anybody who likes it should feel bad.",1693811158,1693811158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics: The cartoony graphics actually don't bother me! I wouldn't mind the ability to turn them off, but they're not an issue. Graphically I have no issues with the game at all! It wont be everyone's style but it doesn't need to be. In this regard, 4/5 stars from me.

Physics: No issues here either! It isn't perfect, but has a balance sufficient for me to race well, so... 3.5/5 stars? Like I said, it's not perfect, but I couldn't pinpoint the exact problem.

Story: Well, story was never the most important part of a racing game but, oof this one is bad. It makes very little sense from start to finish and frankly in a street racing game I don't understand the desperation to present the racers as the good guys here and cops as evil. Cops shouldn't be depicted as evil in these games for trying to stop reckless racing, and sometimes being a little bad is part of the fun! Instead I'd have suggested presenting them as -at worst- punch clock villains. Not really Shining paragons, but not openly sadistic either. I'd even give special focus to any race you can finish without hitting traffic, emphasize the danger and reward avoiding harm to innocents in some way, if you want to make the racer seem good. But the raver is at best an anti-hero, or a villain protagonist. 1/5 stars

Gameplay: Here is where the issues really start for me. I can brush off the story, but... I play racing games on fairly high difficulties and still win more often than not. There are not many that I can't win against the highest difficulty. So when I have trouble winning a race on the LOWEST difficulty? Something is wrong. I can go into a race, never hit anything, nail every turn, and still end up behind the -all- of the AI on the lowest difficulty setting. Somewhere, somehow, you have failed to balance this game properly. And it's not just me, I've seen similar comments in discussions of this game, including with friends.

Here we go. Another NFS has come out and now it's the trivial matter of whether or not the game is decent or another year waiting for a potential dumpster fire. I think it's decent, if anything, improves a bit from Heat.

Need for Speed™ Unbound improves quite a bit from Heat, however, some things aren't very great with this game. This review is going to be based on my own experience and what i think is good and bad. I will say this NFS is, decent, if not one of the better racing titles out there in the arcade genre.

[b]TL;DR: Good Graphics, Actual Progression, Ear Numbing Soundtrack, Cringe dialogue, Cringe Zoomie Humor, Improved gameplay but still needs improvement. Good on sale, Questionable at full price.[/b]

Let's start with the good things:

- Progression. THANK GOD for actual progression. Something that has been severely lacking for racing titles, you have to 'grind' to get what you want. It's a nice balance of having to start with a slow beater and having to race day after day to build up your cash. There is a risk to this too.

- Playing on the hardest difficulty, I can say it's been an actual challenge to win races. The beginning stages have a learning curve to them. It isn't something you're expected to win every race. So if you have this mindset, sorry to disappoint, you are going to come in second or third even based on your skill. I'm very experienced with racing titles and adapt to them. Unbound gives you a bit of a rough time at the start. But trust me, everything gets better.

- Car selection. Good. Very good. It's a big improvement from Heat. I will say it's one of my favorites for a modern NFS title. Sorry, no Toyota. There's 143 cars to pick from and good customization. 

- Cops, I can say I enjoy but also dislike. This is a neutral stance I have with it, I'll come back to this in the bad section. They keep up, which I enjoy. However, they do swarm the streets a bit too much. If it were in the city, understandable. However, driving more in the rural areas, they're swarming everywhere.

- Handing, okay, controversial. At first, it was a learning curve. But after you fall in love with your build and adapt to your car, it's not all as bad as people say. ""Oh, but the steering is unrealistic!"" Yeah? Did you know Need for Speed is also an Arcade racer? Excluding the Shift series, this is an irrelevant take. I can say at most drifting does need a bit of tweaking.

- Artstyle is another controversial take. I like it, but I also don't like it. I appreciate this game for its art direction. It's cool, colorful, and unique in an art style approach, especially in the racing genre. But some parts the artstyle doesn't fit either.

- Gameplay, the most thing I value of all this has indeed excelled higher than Heat in my opinion. Cops have been indeed a challenge, maybe a bit too much at times.

The Bad:

- The Soundtrack. Oh my god Need for Speed, you're becoming out of touch with your Soundtrack selections. Heat may have been bad, but it's a lot more tolerable compared to Unbound personally. Stop selecting music from SoundCloud mumble jumbo rappers that record in their bathrooms. Fortunately, Spotify does fix this, but I feel like it shouldn't be needed in the first place.

- Back to the art style, although I do like the attempt at something new from the NFS team, I can say that there are problems when it comes to it. The shading of your characters does seem out of place, especially with the lighting during the night. Your character might have some odd glowing effect at times. This can lead to weird animations as well. I can respect the attempt however it needs more polishing. Effects are pretty cool to me, however, there should be an option to disable them entirely.

- The direction of dialogue and zoomer lingo. Okay, as a late 'Zoomer' myself growing up with the original Most Wanted and before...I can say that this game indeed tries to fit in with Zoomies which I do not certainly associate myself with. The dialogue is cringe at times, terrible even. I can agree with those who argue about this topic.

- The Cops. I don't get it, NFS is a wildcard when it comes to the police. In one game they'll do a bad job, then do a good job, a better job even, but take steps back to ruin the experience. However, I will say Unbound has a good mixture of good and bad. It's an improvement, but there are steps back that could make it better. So for starters. WHY do the cops not chase you when you know they should? Especially when a dialogue shows ""Suspect Found"" at heat Level 1 and they don't chase you? I don't understand. Especially with the original Most Wanted/or Carbon had this nailed perfectly. I am a bit disappointed by the radio chatter as well, however, I don't think it's entirely bad. The cop chases though, god it's intense on the highest difficulty. I will say these cops do not mess around at the highest level. My final complaint about the police is the fact that they're swarming everywhere. It's essentially a consistent stealth mission and there's a cop in every corner. The density is too much. Back to a positive note, I do dig the chase music to be honest.

- Multiplayer is bare bones. Only 16 people and half the lobbies don't even race, resulting you to have empty lobbies. It's a shame, there needs to be a lobby system for people who just want to race with a full lobby and specific classes. All you get are spamming of pop-ups of races you can't either participate or not a class you don't want. Terrible system. Disappointed in Criterion when Hot Pursuit has a good example for matchmaking. Hell, you could even do a 'High Stakes' mode with this whenever police AI DO get added. Wishful thinking I know. But Multiplayer needs a lot of work. More people in races benefit for less of a grind, there's a whole grind, it's actually a bit dreadful and I thought. I usually stick to single player, but when I want to play Multiplayer it's a bit of a chore to have a casual experience.

Final Verdict:

I'm enjoying the game. Despite the problems, the core aspect of the game nails the true Need for Speed experience and has been better than other modern NFS titles. This feels like an actual arcade racer. Controversial as this might be, especially how divided people are with this game because ""muh realism"". Sorry but Need for Speed was always (except for the Shift series.) an Arcade racer with unrealistic approaches and physics. Complaining about this game because it's not 'realistic' is irrelevant. About the anime stuff too, I don't see it mattering that much, but can agree it looks out of place at times. Pretty 'Meh' for me.

I can understand the turn away about the 'Zoomer' humor, I don't like it either. But let's be real, any modern racing game out there is pretty mid or just bad even. Skipping the story, which has been 'okay' and focusing on the gameplay aspect...I can say it is indeed quite fun.

Can say a good 7.5/10 or hard 8 at most. It's decent, has problems, but definitely not the worst thing EA released. This game does need more content, I think that's my biggest issue.",1669966113,1693704104,True,1154,32,0.924309015274047852,0,True,False,False
1846380,145555516,76561198048737557,0,4,2956,0,2464,1702788390,"So I want to start out by saying I have been a huge fan of the need for speed franchise for many years. I first started playing all the back when need for speed underground came out. I am going to try my best to put my nostalgia behind and give the best and most honest opinion of this game. 

Story: Starting with story I feel this is definitely one of the weakest parts of this game. I mean to be fair need for speed wasn't always know for having the best writing when it came to the stories but if you compare it to NFS most wanted or undercover, even NFS heat had more depth to its story. The story overall is just very plain with very little to offer. There are barely any cut scenes and when there they do nothing to add to the game. 

Graphics: The graphics are by far the best part of the game. I remember seeing the cool styling and visualization in the trailer and that does transfer well into the game play. All the car models look great as well and the character models are fun to customize and look nice as well. 

Game play: The game play is alright to say the least. It can get very repetitive very quickly. How the game works is similar to NFS heat where you rotate between night and day doing races to earn money and upgrades for your car. But the AI racers are buggy at some points and anytime the cops show up during a race it feels like they only target you and none of the other AI racers. One time I was just about to win a race and I had entered a tunnel. All of a sudden a cop spawned right in front of me sideways and I crashed into him and lost the race. This happens a lot. Also there are way to many cop chases in the free roam as well. You can barely avoid them once you are at heat 4 or higher. Also part of the reason why I bought the game was to drive the Delorean. But for you to unlock the delorean in SINGLE PLAYER you have to go online and participate in group events. I think its really dumb to have to do that if you are only playing single player. I also had an issue where the game kept crashing and I had to re-verify the files every so often. Not sure what was causing this but it still happens on occasion. The multiplayer is fine but I am not huge on playing multiplayer in racing unless it's Forza or something. Just a side note there was a weird mission with ASAP rocky also in this game that I didn't like. I had no idea what the frick he was trying to say while I was driving him around. For a celerity cameo in a game this one was very weak. Sorry ASAP I am sure you are a cool person but your mission sucked in this game. 

Conclusion: In the end I would recommend not buying this game at full cost. if it goes on sale for really cheap then it would be worth it. Compared to other racing games out there this is by far one of the weakest entries to come out in the recent years. Me being a huge fan of NFS, I am very disappointed with what EA has done.

But the racing in story mode is just repetitive, I am going back to the same list of AIs & track layout on each playlist. The reward for Heat Level 5 is either too low or don't have any combo multiplier in that sense, so the joy for reward from pursuit is just not there. Imagine how frustrating it is when you're stuck on B class car.

The crashing physics is really aggravating, even the lightest touch to the wall with S+ cars sometimes will be counted as a full on crash.

(Then out of nowhere, I'm picking up ASAP Rocky ... and hits me with that philosophical speech and depressing thoughts ...)

Multiplayer mode (LSO) in Volume 3 was crowded. At Vol 4, it is so dead. Most of what I can get is 6 people. Not sure why they limit it to 16 players for each lobby. Newcomers will get thrashed in Rental cars with other who is in fully kitted car, as there's no separation between new and old players. No wonder why most of the time, only a handful of players wants to join in the race. Can't find a single Linkups for every lobby in Vol 4 as well.

Whatever the future of NFS seems rough, as the dev veterans are leaving from Criterion, can only hope that NFS is not going back to like Heat or Hot Pursuit era.

the game an absolute 11/10 sense of speed, the risk you take whenever you use burst nitro is just chefs kiss. it fills that need for speed (unfortunately not with every car).

open world feels alive, its funny how much walking pedestrians can do in terms of making a world feel not static

the effects are cool as well, because it emphasises whatever action you're doing, jump, drift, grip turn. it makes you feel as if you did something cool. but i wish they wouldve went fully with the cel shaded art style like what Auto Modellista had and then no one wouldve had any complaints with the choice of art style.

now for the poopoo part

drift physics are mid and i wish they'd return a feature from carbon where itd change the physics entirely to make it more fun and fast, because i dont know a singular person who dislikes drifting in carbon. 

cops are either the dumbest babies ever or some 9000 iq twat ready to push you off the road which is somewhat familiar to what nfs mw 2005 had but with the physics that this engine has it feels extremely unfair because it can cost you a race.

car balance is wonky af in multiplayer, where you are essentially locked into playing a hyper car, or using some specific car that clearly outmatches its class despite the in-game lvl calculator saying otherwise. so gl catching up to some spankymcjohnes9000 in his regera

story couldve been tenfold better, a lot of people had its complains with it, so im not going to preach to the choir. but one thing i will say is that some of the voicelines that said in the garage shouldve been in the open world. you miss on so many context clues that its insane.

Game's just broken in multiplayer. Speed pass items are impossible to equip and your cars get randomly brought back to stock when you log off. I have like 3 cars that are permamently bugged at this point and I'm sick of having to buy and customize them over and over. I was always wondering why people don't customize their cars but it's not because they're lazy, it's just because the game is literal garbage on a technical level.

If you don't have this game then don't buy it, especially if you wanna play multiplayer. It's getting buggier and buggier and the only thing the devs are good at is paying off nfs youtubers to hype up an update with 1 car, 2 playlists and 0 bugfixes.
If you already have the game then don't buy any of their bodykit dlcs until they fix the fucking game. If you really want one of the bodykits then just download a mod and get them for free. People can't report you for cheating in this game anyways.

[h1]Update for Vol 2[/h1]
New update is super bare bones and poorly made for something that's been cooking for 3 months.
- Still having tons of issues with cars teleporting etc.
- Starting order in multiplayer races is now broken (was based on your score but now it's random?)
- The new time trial activity they added is garbage. They're all very poorly made and confusing. Often tracks lead you straight onto a wall or on some random indestructible geometry.
- Cops are now in MP, but ONLY IN FREEROAM. No cops during races. Trailer for vol 2 was very misleading as the beggining is staged to look like there are cops during races.
- Still only 16 player lobbies, but now half of the lobby doesn't want to race and they just play around with cops.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]TLDR[/h1]
If buying for singleplayer then get it at a discount (like the 50% off right now). It has it's flaws but was definetly an enjoyable experience.

If buying for multiplayer.... just don't! MP is absolute garbage on a technical level, which just makes it a chore to play at best.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]SINGLEPLAYER[/h1]

Fantastic in the first half but quickly becomes unenjoyable due to poor late game balance. The story also advances way too fast. I got my fun out of it but it's definetly not worth the regular price. It even still has bugs that were in the game since NFS2015 lol. While it was quite apparent to me that this game would be built on heat I at least expected Criterion to really refresh it, and give all past issues that ghost ignored a good hard look. Unfortunately they didn't, and you don't really even feel the studio jump. It just feels like another NFS made by Ghost.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]MULTIPLAYER[/h1] [b]or what finally broke me and made me write this review...[/b]

Servers are somehow getting worse with every new NFS. Only 16 players in lobby (8 in a race) and cars are constantly teleporting around (especially traffic ones). Sometimes you crash for no reason. Sometimes after respawn you spawn in front of the pack, sometimes in the back. You have errors where the server just refuses to let you drift making your car understeer for no reason. Traffic AI stops in the middle of the road for no reason super often. You have BS such as trains spawning in some races that cut off half of the pack (how does it even make it past testing?!). THEY ENCOURAGE RAMMING BY LOCKING CARS BEHIND DRIVER TAKEDOWNS! And many more issues...

To top that off developers stay silent about any updates to the game and it's constantly on a 50% off sale, meaning that it probably sold very poorly. Let's just hope they don't abandon this game as well.",1670008212,1693392337,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b] Good [/b]

+  Graphics are nice, I love the art style. Every racing game looks like forza now,
trying to be ultra realistic 16 times the detail, its getting old. The comic effects give
this game its own personality.
+  Driving physics are surprisingly good, at least to me. Cars feel like they have weight but they are still
responsive. Burst nitrous is fun. Both grip builds and drift builds are viable. 
+  Car customization is great. Most cars have a solid selection of visual parts, as well as engine swaps,
performance upgrades, engine sound tuning, and more. Theres only around 140 cars but the selection is 
varied. Where toyota tho
+  Theres a story and progression which racing games seem to be allergic to
right now. The game doesnt give you 50 cars off the start *cough horizon 5*, you actually
get to work your way up. 
+  The map is solid. Theres also pedestrians around so it doesnt feel completely dead.

[b] Bad [/b]

-  Story is mid. Theres no gripping narrative or likable characters except Rydell, its quite goofy. You
also dont get to see or race against the main villian.
-  Dialogue is cringe. Everyone sounds like an exaggerated tik toker, and the cop radio is like
kids in a cod lobby. The game also tries to make the racers the good guys which is weird. Characters
will unironically say stuff like ""The police are so mean :(( "" right after killing 57 other innocent drivers 
and pedestrians like lmao.
-  Theres a large map with tons of roads but you'll be repeating the same tracks a lot. I dont understand why
this is so difficult for devs like the roads are already there just add some more races, forza does this too and its annoying.
- Multiplayer is eh. I wish there was more content but thats not my main issue. I hate how story mode progression is seperate from multiplayer. You spend all this time building up your garage in story mode and once you finish and switch to online, the game just says ""f u dumbass"" and makes you start from scratch. Also literally every car is locked
behind a grindy challenge to complete before you can buy it in multiplayer. Good thing its insanely easy to give yourself infinite money
and bypass the car unlock challenges, EA forgor to add anticheat lol.
-  Police spawning is ridiculous. Your heat goes up so fast, after a few races the police are absolutely everywhere. They dont
even have any spawning limits to make it fair, you'll just see them pop in on your minimap right in front of you.
- The soundtrack is atrocious my ears are bleeding

Things that are better than Heat:
• Singleplayer storyline.

• Car customization and selection.

• Cartoon art style is honestly badass; really great visuals.

• The soundtrack goes hard as hell. Thank you A$AP Rocky.

• THE HANDLING. This is the only reason I can recommend this game. After 7+ long years of Frostbite NFS games that felt janky as hell, they finally figured out how to make the car steer and drift in a way that doesn't make it feel like your controller is broken. This is the reason I'm going to play this game 100x more than Heat, despite Heat having done many many things better. It feels great to play, and considering how few racing games even exist anymore, I'll take it as a massive win.

Things that are worse than Heat:
• Sense of speed. I don't know if it's the FOV or the motion blur but it feels like you're driving much slower.

• The map sucks. Heat's map was a beautiful Miami lookalike, with beaches, a shuttle launchpad, a mall, parking garages, and other clever inclusions. Why the hell did they make a bad knockoff of Chicago? It's ugly and has no character.

• Lack of offroad racing. I've never liked the offroad racing in NFS, but if it's going to be an option with car selection and tuning options, just give us some damn races for it at least.

• Amount of races in general. After 2 hours, you've basically played every single race. They really need to add more routes.

• Cop chases are more annoying than thrilling, and the rewards for them are terrible. Really incentivizes you to just drive slow and hide from the cops on your radar.

• Day/night as a gameplay variation (I.E. Heat's nights were thrilling and dangerous, while the daytime had a more casual vibe. Plus the legal races were a neat switchup.)

• Multiplayer/singleplayer progression is separated, so you have to play twice as much to buy the same cars. And holy hell is this game grindy, barely any reward money is given so it takes a very long time to unlock many of the vehicles.

But the sheer technological progress of  2 decades finally made a decent effort live up to the old standards.

Anyhow, Unbound is basically zoomer Underground and is doing a pretty great job at it.
Don't just stick with the bandwagon of superficial salt city, make your own conclusions as there is real fun to be had here.

Some highlights/warnings:

Burst Nitrous is weaponized rule of cool, a truly amazing mechanic. Just experiencing this makes the game a must play IMO.

""AnImE eFfeCts RuInEd It"" I'm sick and tired of this. Not even anime-ish, more of a Spider-verse trend-chaser, and works really well emphasizing hype moments and the sense-of speed. Also world-cohesion. While the more arcade-y handling could be immersion breaking in a purely photo-realistic presentation (that' why I left NFS when HP 2010 brought the Burnout BS), this presentation further immerses you into the fantasy and makes you drive more recklesly and push the fun beyond the limits of reality:
Handbrake turn at 200mph and stablize instantly with burst nitrous G-force only turns you into jelly if you believe in it.
Rear-end an unsuspecting armored cop Ford Raptor for stealth-kill damage bonus and prevent a tedious chase with barely any damage on your nimble little speedmonster.
Yyyup, this is more mechanics, than presentation, but the presentation makes the comic-book-logic mechanics fun instead of immerson breaking. So just roll with it.

Cops are over all easier than what I've learned of Heat, but more clearly differentiated promoting a more tactical approach. The sheer amount of them can be tedious in the single player campaign. However to me that's more weak whiners not engaging with the systems properly. Map knowledge and strategic approach turns the tedium into immersion and power-trip as you learn to make a fool of them.

Campagin progression itself operates on a fixed day-night cycle. Many complained about being a downgrade to Heat's day vs night and nightly risk-reward system. They have every right to prefer that approach, but can we justnot with the tunnel vision hate. Different approach fits more with the themes and story of this one. And a straight up upgrade would've invalidated the previous game. Now both can stand on it's own with their own flavour.
Heat focused on the day vs night contrast and d*ck measuring against the cops.
Unbound treats day and night in continous pairs with the new day as a breather from the cops and the race against the clock for getting ready for the weekly main events.
I really liked Unbound's approach through the story campaign itself. However keeping the weeks system post-game and not having any quick-race option is quite restricting for single player variety and quick pick up and play sessions. Multiplayer is fun enough to not really worry about it yet, but stil it is a big shortcoming.

Music: heavy emphasis on hip-hop and electronic tracks with large variation in language. There are some utter cringe ones 
 that are already memed to hell and back among them, but came to like most of it. The overall OST fits the vibe the game is going for. And luckily as of vol.3 update you can skip music in both races and free roam.",1693246900,1693246900,True,1,0,0.493766486644744873,0,True,False,False

Drifting seems to be the only acceptable driving style.

Cons: There is no point to cop chases like there was in Heat. In Unbound, it becomes a boring chore to deal with. I hate having to constantly evade police only to get back into the pursuit because a cop saw me again. What's also annoying is that occasionally you will crash your car for some reason or you will lose control of your car when racing. I've tried fine tuning my cars but it's hard for them to be consistent. I understand that each car has its own characteristics but it's annoying to have to experience wrecking your car during some races to dial down its handling. And lastly, the soundtrack. Not going to lie, there are a few bangers on it. But it will never compare to the older NFS soundtracks. I wish there was more variety. Most of the characters are likeable except Tess who is probably written by someone who is so out of touch with young people that they wrote Tess to sound like a cool kid.

- The story is just hilarious, catered towards people who literally just turn off their brain and if you try to get immersed you realise it's a whole lot of ""bro, bro, totally gonna install a turbo tonight bro.""
- The modding community is at a severe lack of motivation to even try and bring this game back together which in turn hurts the longevity of its single player.
- Multiplayer lacks... everything! From Events to Car choice to physics tunes to variety in customization.
- Music

The whole game is a solid marketing test to see if they can get enough young kiddies by going ""yo bro"" for 10 hours and keep milking the franchise to death in turn.

Soundtrack feels like it was put together by an algorithm. It is just a collection of songs from similar genres, but from all around the world, lacking variety in sound. Also, for a game that features A$AP, there is a noticeable lack of A$AP. Maybe they didn't have the budget to license as much of his music as they wanted; but it is just strange to feature a musician and then only have a handful of his songs in the game. 

Police is a mixed bag in the game. The radio chatter is very juvenile and lacks any kind of seriousness, it isn't even satirical. In  B, A, and to some extend A+ tier cars the police does pose a threat and a challenge; but once you get into S and S+ tier vehicles they can barely touch you. For my personal enjoyment, I would set the game difficulty higher to get more aggressive police which then makes races unfair towards you, because of excessive AI rubber-banding. It's a trade off that doesn't have a middle ground. I really miss the days of Black Box, they did a fantastic job with police mechanics twenty years ago. What happened, Criterion? You guys proved that you can do fun police mechanics with NFS: Hot Pursuit thirteen years ago. Why not now? 

The story is mid. Nothing special, just something to tie in together the day/night system together. There are some funny moments in the game's occasional radio news updates and election campaign ads. But most of the character dialog makes everyone appear to be selfish jerks. City youths are organizing unsanctioned races all around the city, putting everyone on the streets in danger. Every character ignores that as an issue and rants about how the police and city politicians are bad for trying to stop them. I understand that it is current year, but if you are making a street racing game then portray everyone as criminals then. Most Wanted (2005) gets the praise it does because it wasn't scared to portray The Player and members of Blacklist as criminals, and the police in that game took it as a serious threat and threw everything they could to put a stop to it. Including stepping over the line to get results. 

Driving mechanics are fine. I personally hate tap to drift and turn it off entirely, and I am thankful to the developers for adding it as an option. Tuning for drifting is tricky, you need to find the correct upgrade/tuning balance to get the car to consistently slide. In my personal opinion onroad/offroad suspensions should be avoided when building a drift car, because some events go over both paved/unpaved surfaces. Offroad vehicles are entirely pointless in the game, unless you just want to complete the longjumps and quick laps for extra cash/game completion. 

I haven't touched the multiplayer yet, so will have to comment on it later. 

I would recommend the game, but not for full price. If it is like $20 or $30 on sale, then grab it. Otherwise pass on it, there are better NFS games available on Steam.",1693158095,1693158095,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In my experience, it's largely been a pleasure playing it. It fully adopts the hybrid comic book artstyle and blends it with realistic graphics quite well to give it a vibrant and exciting feel. Vehicles definitely don't handle quite realistically (it's NFS), but they built more on what they developed in NFS 2016 with drift and grip builds, and the two are much more defined and unique both in handling and performance customization. Additionally, different tiers of races now have a hard cap, meaning you can't enter if your vehicle is rated too high, and you won't want to enter if its anything much lower than the top of that tier. Both of these features require you to fine-tune your cars much more, and allow for more unique builds and playstyles, providing both a neat variety of opponents in races and the opportunity to really flesh out your garage with all sorts of cars for every occasion. 
Multiplayer and single-player are separated game modes, so you'll have individual banks and garages for both. This means you can choose to avoid one or the other entirely, without it really affecting your gameplay either way (a few body kits/cosmetics/vehicles can only be unlocked via single- or multiplayer challenges, so this is your only real con).
Although the story is quite forgettable (it's a racing game, I'm not bothered by that) - and perhaps too many of the voice lines attempting the ""millennial/gen-z gap"" humor trope venture too far into *cringe* territory - the single-player is decently challenging. Each race adds heat that is only removed after a full day/night cycle, so it requires you to be selective with races you participate in and find a balance with making enough money (and not losing it) over the course of 4 weeks to be able to buy your way in to the final race tournament and claim victory. Not very extensive once you figure out a rhythm, but addicting enough.
Lastly, Unbound does a good job of embracing the street-racing scene, bringing a larger and more wild variety of vehicles body kits, spoilers, rims, decals, horns, and underglows than I've seen before in an NFS game like this. Bumper deletes, chassis-mounted wings, exposed turbochargers, turbofan wheels, the works. Paired with the fact that they've adopted a live-service model with (completely FREE) seasonal passes that add new cosmetics and vehicles every few months for the foreseeable future, there are limitless possibilities to what you can build and race.
There is always room for improvement, of course. But other than the high price and some minor optimization issues, everything else is opinion and personal preference.

There is no sense of progress in the game. You just grind the same races and streets to get more money and upgrade your car.

First, I got it by extremely low price bundle, it just closed to several dollars. Therefore many shortages and suck things that EA made are acceptable.
Second, excepting above shortages, I love the incredible graphic performance of NFS 22 with comic elements in game. It's fascinating mixture, I never haven't imagined before. Nowadays most of racing games are pursuing the realistic feeling but 
Criterion game studio found a new style, it's amazing.
Finally, I want to say in my childhood when I first playing the NFS 9 Most Wanted, the touched is still existing inside of my heart. But we all know what is EA like, it's a awful company, even give them a lot of excellent studios, they always have methods to make a mess.
The most important thing I have to add on, pls never ever to pre-order EA's game, if you aren't believe, EA will teach you what is real discount. Back stab on the way and coming soon dude.",1692712863,1692712950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like the rubber-banding is the worst iv'e ever played like i didn't Even know what rubber banding is until this game.
The cops in this game absolutely God awful They're either So bad they take themselves out or they go and just won't go down or just be super annoying.
Driving is just bad to meh because it's focusing too much on a drifting
The crash system is just annoying and small crashes that would normal make you go from 1st to 2nd mow make you go from 1st to dead last and with rubber banding you have to restart BUT

LIMITED RESTARTS ARE FECKING STUPID like who thought of this. Like most the issues above make limited restarts just not work, like you barely hit a car and it does a dumb flip animation and then restarts you so u gotta restart, u get taken out by a dumb ass cop that went beast mode and turned into Goku and instant transmissioned your ass into a tree or wall so you gotta restart, u move the stick 0.01 cm too far and over drift gotta restart, Becomes even worse when you start see the issues combined and there's issues I didn't even state .

Also Hate hearing when people say the game is high risk high reward, like there's no such thing as high risk high reward in this game because the high risk high reward has turned into normal risk normal reward Because there's no other risk you can take. a shit analogy is that in Call of Duty multiplayer there is core and hardcore,in core you have quite a bit of health and you also heal, but in hardcore You can get shot only once or twice before you die and you cannot heal But it's easier to get kills so there's actually a sense of high risk high reward in hardcore because you can get kills and kill streaks far easier because everyone dies faster but the high risk is you also die faster",1692694178,1692694178,False,3,0,0.526315808296203613,0,True,False,False

It deserves solid criticism, sure, but wanting it to be just like Forza is plain ignorance. Every single damn racing game nowadays looks the same, and I'm tired of it. Unbound flipped the bird to all that and made sure to have something that NFS always had above others -- style. The driving effects and the sound sample system are stunning and signal a breath of fresh air amidst all the games nowadays which have their art direction dictated by lifeless suits rather than passionate artists.

The handling is the best we have in modern NFS. You can grip very hard and completely disable Brake 2 Drift if you wish so, or embrace drifting all together, hell, you can even find an in-between if you are feeling adventurous. The burst system is a great addition to the gameplay.

The story is indeed confused about what it wants to say. Trying to paint the racers under a good light is just weird. A few college kids complaining about how the cops are evil for going after them right after pulling 300 KM/H on a public highway and ramming others into traffic is silly, plus all the political discourse it tries to engage with despite being on the fence about all it wants to say. Many parts of the plot are not explained or given much substance, like the game's main villain. To sum it up, the revenge plot is a great idea, but the execution is subpar.

The dialogue tries to be cool and hip with its wording but it just ends up being alienating. Though I don't think it's as bad as the stuff we've seen in The Crew 2/MotorFest and Forza Horizon 4/5 as, at least in here, they try to be expressive to a degree instead of the 1-dimensional puppets we got in those other titles. That said, Rydell is by far the best and most relatable character.

An issue I hope Criterion improves with updates are the content updates. I'm not a fan of live-services and I'm happy with most of what we got in the base game for it's single-player mode, but the multi-player needs some meatier content. The Porsche celebration update is interesting, but we could've received a few more cars. I'm not asking for dozens of cars to be added with each update, but more than 1 would be nice.

All I wish for is that people would realize that, despite it's flaws, Unbound is trying to shake up a genre that's been left in the gutter for over a decade. There are no other arcade racers in the AAA market right now, and the other racing games we do have might as well be cast in the same mold.",1692461383,1692461643,True,342,8,0.884100914001464844,21,True,False,False

- Almost unplayable at high speeds like one small turn and you lose control immediately
- Opponents even if you're ranked higher than them sometimes just gain magical speed out of nowhere and they're impossible to catch up

- After a crash spawns you at around 150 km/h in 1st gear which is annoying especially if you're playing with man transmissions
- Why limit resets to 4 per day and night?
- You can't make any mistakes during the race otherwise your hopes of winning are done for

They released a pvp option very recently and it's a 1v1. No additional AI racers. NFS Heat was perfect. They shot themselves on the foot with this one. You know when a game stops being fun and kind of turns into a chore? This is one of those games.

Let me make it short.

Pros:

-Cell shading is alright.
-Cops are much easier this time around.
- You can buy/sell cars from your garage

Cons:
-No true coop racing.
-You go too fast traffics spawning can't keep up and spawns cars like 5 ft in front from you.
-Good luck dodging anything at high speeds.
-Can't tell what's breakable and whats not.
-I still don't know how from what angle I have to enter the safehouse. Sometimes I just rive around it till I can go in.
-Story is somehow is designed so that you keep using the same car from beginning to end. Turn that car into a jack of all trades it's the cheapest way to run all races.
-9/10 you'll have to outrun the cops after a race.
-Doesn't matter if you're totally overqualified the computer racers will always catch up.
-Computer doe this odd thing where they nitrous at the same time as you do. Some times you're right next to a racer and nos does nothing to help because that other racer will also use and invisible nos.
-No fast travel? What's wrong with you?
-You can buy/sell cars from your garage only. Same goes for upgrades. You have to skip that day/night to actually look at the store.

That was one thing that I missed in some previous racing games that was a staple in much older racing games. Even though it doesn't look as realistic as previous Need For Speeds, it's still fun to play. My biggest gripes however are that the racing tiers don't really seem fair. You pretty much have to edge your vehicle up to the limit of the racing tier. For example: like maxing your car class to the limit of class A without edging it over to class S so that you can still use it in class A races without loosing in the class A races. The difficulty is very high! Even with being a veteran NFS player, I found myself having to bring the difficulty level all of the way down in order to even stand a chance of winning 1st place from time to time. Also you have to pay in order to enter some races which really cuts into your winnings. Sometimes this even prevents you from entering some races on certain days in the game due to lack of funds.

   Now the game has good points: 
1.- The sheer amount of car customization, which in my opinion is the best among current racing games.
2.- The vibe; like it or not (YouKnowWhichOne fans, EA was just pandering to the trends at the time, it's not just ""Back in my days games were better everything now is sh*t"", part of your disdain for Unbound is that you're old now and can't relate to the ""hip"" new style they're trying out to get the attention of people under 25, zoomers mostly) they definitely nailed what they were going for with the grafitti visual effects, cell shaded characters, anime stickers, rap music, ""diverse"" cast of characters and branded clothing (Though they could've spent less on clothing brand licenses to put into car licenses in my opinion [*cough* *cough* Toyota *cough*]).
3.- The return of a viable non-break-to-drift driving style.
4.- Not going for the style and gameplay that nearly every racing game nowadays is going for of ""Realistic legal circuit racing simulator with photo realistic cars that drive in photo realistic recreations of real places with a physics engine that tries to be as close to real life as possible by taking into account hundreds of simulated factors like tire pressure, asphalt composition, the driver's last time eating a BLT sandwich, etc.""
5.- A$AP Rocky was a neat adition to the cast.
6.- Takeover is a nice new event type that breaks the monotony every now and then.
Buuuut thats it sadly.

EA launcher bad.
   
The car list is more or less the same as Heat, hero cars (which were included for free with the game in previous iterations) are now being used to sell EAplay subscriptions and overpriced DLC with FoMO tactics like time limited packs and the dreaded battle pass system.
   The story is bad. Not asking for a masterpiece but it's meh. There are very little cutscenes, the majority of which are tucked together at the start of the game to kinda introduce the main cast, [spoiler]rush through the relationship between Rydell, you and your best friend Yaz before doing the same as in Payback, although it's less like recent Fast and Furious and more like a tokyo drift zoomer original story[/spoiler], to then introduce your objective of ""winning the big race, taking revenge and going to the big leagues"" via the most annoying character: Tess ""Bruh i told her... bruh what the BRUH"", [spoiler]oh and also the never seen bad guy thats pulling the strings that the writers forgot about midway[/spoiler]. From then on there are almost no interactions between you and the bad guys until the end, only ever having phone conversations with Tess and Rydel that don't really deepen the story or advance the relationships, which renders the story and plot twists very meaningless due to the player not really connecting with the cast.
   The main cast are assh0l3s (Except Rydell). [spoiler]Yaz has negative interactions for most of the game and almost at the end they suddenly decide to make her a good guy with a tiny ""redemption"" arc[/spoiler], and Tess is incredibly annoying (doesn't matter if you say ""you're not supposed to like her"", it doesn't seem the writers intended for you to dislike her from the start).
   A$AP Rocky is barely in the story, only being the takeover announcer for a big chunk of the game until [spoiler]becoming a rival in the S+ races and when he gives you a looong monologue in a taxi mission[/spoiler].
   They nailed the ""#Diversity #2020's #TikTok"" vibe, in typical corporate fashion by two executives going ""-hey diversity and the LGTV peoples is trending with kids let's make an inclusive cast of characters. ~Yeah they also love the rap musics let's get many rappists"". This (in my opinion) affects mainly two things; the licensed soundtrack and the rival racers.
   There is almost no variety in songs or genres. It's just rap in different languages. I'm not saying it's horrendous (like certain people that say ""oH oNLy RocK Has ThE EneRgY aNd sPeeD foR High spEEd RacIng YouKnowWhichOne OST gOoD aNyTHinG ElSe bAd"") but come on every other game has variety and it is for a reason.
   The rivals get it pretty bad. To ""represent"" many different people there are a lot of them and they're of ""many"" different backgrounds, but all of them only have a superficial ""biography"" of less than 8 lines of text and almost no interactions with the player (only a few have a taxi mission where they have a small conversation with you) except a few lines of dialogue to react to actions when they're in a position close to you.
   They also messed up writing the street racing scene in universe. The racers, and specially the podcaster that doesn't even race, act like they're innocent children playing in the street to express themselves and the mean politician lady is oppressing them with a mean police state, while in reality they're going 200 miles an hour and slamming into the first SUV with a family inside that they see. The cops are ok, fittingly being complete psycopaths who have no regard for anyone's safety (not even their own) who will drive off a cliff just to get you. And except for the B tier rivals and the russian? criminal (they tried to make the literal gang leader Cha Cha sympathetic) they all feel like rich kids using daddy's money (specially the ones that say in their bio ""they made money on their own"").

   While the updates have improved the online it is still years behind other games, having weird restrictions like limiting your matchmaking to 16 person lobbies that end up on no one joining playlists due to other players already being on some other activities (the linkup is fun but it contributes to this problem), which leads to not being able to race and not being able to unlock the ability to buy cars (Unless you have very patient friends who also play the game) due to them having to be slowly unlocked separately from singleplayer via weirdly specific challenges that are for the most part dependent on other people joining or starting a specific type of playlist (also challenges mainly ask for playlists, which consist of 3+ races mostly).

   The ""Palace edition"" is worthless with its meh at best cosmetics and cars that you can't even use stock for the main story (They unlock for buying after their class' big event already happened, at which point why not just buy and tune a cheaper in tier car).",1692337590,1692339012,False,3,0,0.524267137050628662,0,True,False,False

TL:DR; below
- The singleplayer is alright, the characters and story are good for what they're trying to be, and the gameplay is solid
- The cops are kind of mediocre in singleplayer and absolutely worthless in multiplayer.
- Progression is frustrating, especially because of how restarts work, the qualifiers, and the fact most of your progress is separated between multiplayer and singleplayer
- The soundtrack is alright for an NFS soundtrack. There are a few bangers even. But there's also a lot of mumble rap and, by god, some of it is just terrible.

I can say that it is not as bad as other EA games but you can see that clearly they could have done better definitively
You can see a bug here from time to time, and in PC i felt like sometimes there is huge latency on the controllers for some reason, no matter Xbox, PS5

The ""hard"" difficulty is incredibly hard, it is a challenge, but it does fairly unfair from time to time, 

The most annoying in this regard is probably police appearing out of nowhere when you are about to escape, like literally, appear behind you.

I probably think this is one of the best and worst games 

You get police at the end of a race EVEN if you escaped mid race. which is incredibly tedious.

Gameplay is incredibly repetitive, specially Gymkana events, that are kind of mandatory?

The game bugs on the menus from time to time and you need to reset from time to time


The Online experience is way worst than Heat, honestly they did not had to change the formula, but they did

Nice review overall, I do not comment often but I do watch a lot of content specifically from Falcon, he is an awesome contect creator
I did not enjoy this NFS as much as I had the hype for it, while some things do feel great, some things I really do expect to see better updates in the future maybe

One strong point I forgot to mention is that during the whole game I felt like the Handling is incredibly unresponsive and they could have done better in the Grip/Drift balance

Maybe it is just me, but from the people that watched me play it live and the friend that also bought the game, the Handling feels incredibly wrong somehow, it is hard to describe


Avoid this game until the price is more friendly

Edit 16/08/2023
Wow, Volume 4 just released and I notice this is even sh***er every time, I can't believe EA can go this far. this game is so bad that you find it at a higher discount than Heat which is a way better game. 

Just noticed the game wants to be managed like if it was seasons ? Previous volumes no longer appear as DLCs so if you missed on that content it's gone forever?

Although Criterion's name is familiar, their studio is far from the same team it was back in the day, with this being their first mainline production since 2012's Most Wanted. While I find it hard to discredit Ghost's work on the franchise (with this being based upon ideas from Heat), Criterion providing the bare minimum to a nearly 30-year-old racer is looking a lot more promising than almost ten years of experimentation with an otherwise dull open-world racer.

Of all the additions made during the Ghost-era of the franchise, progression has seem to evolved the most, with Unbound expanding upon the risk vs. reward system first introduced in 2013's Rivals. While that game itself wasn't shockingly innovative, players took it upon themselves to decide how much time was best spent in the open world. Participating in activities would reward players with points, but also increase the presence of police, resulting in a slight dynamic between player greed and an ever increasing police presence. More pursuing cops would multiply the player's points, but made it harder to get to a garage safely. Get busted by the cops, and lose the multiplier you've worked for. 

Now, the dynamic between the player and police isn't necessarily new, as Need for Speed has already differentiated itself from other franchises by focusing on this conflict. Rivals simply took this concept a bit further by strictly tying it to a points-based progression system, though execution left a lot to be desired. While Ghost were simultaneously developing their first game, they were also still acquiring new talent for their production. According to rumors, development of Rivals barely took over six months, resulting in a buggy, unfinished game, recycling most core ideas from 2010's Hot Pursuit. Fan backlash and an overall mixed reception gave the studio an additional year to reboot the franchise in 2015, following it up with 2017's ostracized title. We don't talk about that one. 

Tragedy struck in 2019 when Ghost finally seemed to get it right. Heat was the first title since Rivals to work with the risk vs. reward system, now expanded with a distinct separation between day- and nighttime. During the day, cops were slower and less aggressive, while the player participated in legal street races for money. Switching to night, cops became more present and active, fighting the player during illegal street races for XP. Losing to the cops would mean losing some cash, and the active multiplier tied to the increasing police presence. Having learned their lessons from previous titles, Ghost managed to develop the most interesting entry to the franchise in several years. Aside from the story being quite short, overall presentation and light endgame content made the game worthwhile for dedicated fans. However, EA's meat-grinder was yet to claim another victim. 

Following the news of Ghost's closure, many were skeptical about Criterion's plans for the franchise. While their own lineup of games is one of the most respected outputs of any studio, many problems with the recent games were propagated by their efforts. A lack of balance between different handling types, an emphasis on crashing, and missing customization were some of the mayor issues before Ghost stepped in. Obviously, after switching developers for the sixth time in the series, and facing a delay pulling Criterion off their project into the nightmare that was Battlefield 2042, there were some reasons to spent your time living a more fulfilled life.

Luckily, I didn't, and Unbound turned out to be pretty alright. Never before have I noticed how simple rules make a game like this work better. The biggest change here is the removal of XP, where Unbound becomes the ultimate capitalistic dystopia wherein cash does everything. Within the world, you participate in races where buy-ins are necessary to compete. Risk some money upfront, and hope you win it back after you finish the event. Some activities require specific cars, so you'll need multiple of them if you're out to make the most money. Then again, participating in more activities mean a higher presence of cops, and they are in fact still as homicidal and corrupt in this one. 

Expanding upon the ideas of Heat, the game is still separated between day- and nighttime. However, the police presence during the day carries over into the nighttime now, where the biggest prizes are to be won. Risking more attention from the police during the day would give you a harder time at night, so planning out a session becomes a bit of a necessity. Each increasing Heat-level introduces a new unit of police cars, with their own abilities and counter-tactics. Even though cops would regularly spawn right next to me or reenter a pursuit just seconds after seemingly losing them, chases were fun and generally challenging. 

The biggest news here isn't necessarily the addition of the cartoon Driving Effects, but rather some simple, additional rules that strengthen the overall experience. Cops don't instantly spot you, but will engage after driving within their line of sight for a few seconds. Disabling your engine makes it harder for police helicopters to spot you, though driving around skyscrapers and bridges will also do the trick. Car repairs are on a cooldown, but don't run out after a couple of uses like in Heat. Add the simple facts that the damage system finally isn't broken, the driving physics are mostly satisfying, the game generally looks good, the soundtrack is mostly strong (yeah I said it), and we seem to be in the money. 

Just to note the Driving Effects, I think they are done quite tastefully. They don't get in the way of actual gameplay, aside from the occasional PNG appearing above your car, blocking your view to indicate a certain gameplay moment. Instead, they compliment a new system where certain actions like drifting, jumping, drafting and making grip-turns reward you with an extra burst of nitrous. It's a cool little system to indicate how other cars behave, but also reward players for driving dangerously. This in itself is a bit of a Criterion trademark, so it's cool to see the new generation of the studio finding new ways to differentiate themselves. 

If there's anything to criticize, I'd feel the overall tone and format of the game has to be mentioned. I don't really remember illegal street racing being morally accepted, but Unbound treats it as such. It feels weird to have such a stance, even when the game indirectly blames the player's actions for the rising cost of living within the game's fictional city. Self expression is treated a bit too seriously by the characters, which makes me miss the simple days where the player was just a nameless jackass.

Furthermore, the NFS format for an open-world game is getting a bit tired. Races in itself are fine, but the activities between races have stayed mostly the same since the reboot. Collect some items, participate in drift zones and short speedruns, at least the rewards are worth your time, but we've already done this in other entries. It's a shame, really, since these activities took me to some criminally underutilized parts of the map, questioning why the ""normal"" game didn't took me there. Also, with all of these off-road paths seemingly hidden everywhere, where are the actual off-road races? 

In the end though, I didn't expect Unbound to be this competent. Maybe because the bar has been lowered drastically over the past decade, but I feel the franchise has finally took a step in the right direction. Other franchises do realism better, so it's a breath of fresh air to see Need for Speed doing it's own thing. As long as Asap Rocky isn't involved again, it could give the team in Guildford a larger piece of the pie.

Installs the EA app. (That speaks for itself)

Singleplayer is a step up from Vanilla Heat, but a big step down from 2015 or any Unite releases.

Multiplayer was an outright afterthought on launch. Had a terrible classing system, poorly balanced vehicles, day only, and no cops. I genuinely thought anything could be ""more fun with friends"" until I tried it. A recent patch has improved some of these things.

Handling the vehicles in a Need for Speed has honestly never felt worse, so heavily scripted that you can break the physics of gravity itself by trying to engage a drift like you would in an actual car. The handbrake is somehow an engine of omnipotent friction that can bring a vehicle travelling at 300km/h to a halt, not to mention slandering any attempt you might be making at a drift. The powersliding is brought over directly from heat, though seemingly made worse in the process.

The soundtrack is especially good when it's turned off. If I hear one more ""rapper"" I'm going to lose my mind. (Worth mentioning both rap and hip-hop are genres that I typically enjoy) Not saying it's all bad, bus some of the songs used in the soundtrack are stuff I would actually put on a satirical ""music that nobody likes"" playlist. It's genuinely that rough.

I probably should have saved the price of the game for a tank of gas in my real-life economy car, which this game somehow makes more entertaining than driving literally all of the 21st century's dream cars.",1670013317,1692025733,False,17,3,0.418614625930786133,1,True,False,False

Yes, they do chase you right after every race, but they don't really pop up out of nowhere right in front of you during the cooldown period.

I can't really comment on the driving model. Arcades does what arcades does best. It's not meant to be realistic; definitely don't go into this game expecting a simulator experience.

The stylistic choice is weird as hell. There's nothing wrong with going for a unique cartoony look, but mixing it with realistic world and car models just breaks the immersion. Either fully commit with a cartoon, or realistic choice, just don't do half measures.

The story is... modern. The dialogue is second rate, ESPECIALLY with the cops' chatter. Really makes it feel like the cops aren't taking their jobs seriously. We used to get 3 hours worth of police chatter with proper codes and callouts, what happened, EA?

Boss battles aren't really challenging either. Doesn't matter the difficulty settings, as long as you have a car that meets the racing requirements, you could feasibly catch up with the other drivers. Bosses in the OG games would straight up kick your ass.

Also don't like the new 'participation award' payout mechanic where you could gain a net profit even if you scored 5th. This, at least in my opinion, promotes mediocrity. Ask any racer: It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning's winning.

the game has its cons of course, all games do !! but i wouldnt judge the game based on the reviews claiming its too unrealistic and hoohaa. if you like arcadey racers, you will probably like this game a lot. if you dont, go play forza or something idk :P

After having finished it, and now with decent time in multiplayer I can see the flaws:

-The game features a lot of boring mumble rap, there's no ""EA TRAXX"" editor to include only the tracks you like as there's been 20 years ago.

-Keybinds for keyboards can be changed, but you're stuck with a pre-made controller layout.
Criterion, who the hell puts handbrake on x/square?! (Luckily, this can be circumvented by using the XBox Accessories App, still a no-go.
)
- The artstyle is great, and I like they tried something new for the series. But while I'm not a fan of ASAP Rocky I wonder why he was used so little in the game. He congratulates you after a specific race event with the same 4 voice lines (Takeover events) and has the MB 190E as custom car - missed potential here if you already get a popular rapper.

- Storyline is alright for a racing game, a bit cringe but the protagonist captures my reaction quite well, as in ""pls stfu""

For the Multiplayer:

-Linkups are a great way to earn money, the best one in fact. Other players need to cooperate and do that more or less.
HOWEVER, on a server with a max capacity of 16 players, how can you get a full lobby for actual racing *in a racing game* if the linkup is every 5 minutes? Introduce matchmaking for playlists to get actual full lobbies. I'm not kidding if I say the hardest/grindiest achievement in this game is not the ""collect 100% of collectibles/activities"", its the ""race in a full lobby of 8 players"".
I've had it happen once in my 40ish hours of MP gameplay..

Update at 90 hours:

the more I play the game, the more I dislike it. I join a multiplayer lobby, I'm alone or with 2 people on a server. Crossplay is enabled and its unacceptable.
Finally found my first cheater and couldnt report him in game for cheating. I can report him for all kinds of reasons: offensive liveries, Spam, harassment - but not for cheating.

In the main menu it takes a couple seconds for you to be able to get control of the game and unpause it, as you drive around for a couple minutes the game starts giving this weird Glitchy filter look that it gets so nauseating to see but that's not the worst of it, the AI cars driving around the city in the open map starts to glitch out, Cars disappearing, textures swapping out, Cars launching each other in to the atmosphere and a Texture that stretches so far and beyond that it covers my screen and THAT spas out as well. Cops being more annoying than harder, no replayability in Story mode.

BEFORE I START THE ACTUAL REVIEW, if you are going to play this game and care about your progress, I highly recommend you create save backups. There are instances where your save will just get deleted and the cloud will be useless in that case. CREATE. SAVE. BACKUPS.

In addition there could be several other issues where for example the game won't start. In my own experience I found out that the official forums usually have a fix. Usually.

On to the actual review...

First of all, get the game on sale. Don't bother with the DLC unless you really want to get them or want to support the creators.

The graphics are actually really good. The cars look jaw-dropping and while you may hate the cartoon style characters at first you actually get used to them and begin to think that they make a good contrast to the game world. Character customisation is also fairly decent minus the clothing options. Also an important note: the cartoon car effects could be disabled.

Soundtrack is... it is not for everyone. Definitely not for me so I mute the music and put on my own music from previous games. But you might enjoy it. If not you can just do what I do.

Car customisation is great. There are a few missing things but the way the updates are going, it will be fine.

The gameplay and difficulty is rather unexpected. The handling is different than the previous two games but once you get used to it, you enjoy it. I have heard from my friends that the game is surprisingly difficult but if you ask me it is closer to that arcade racing game feel which is I believe what the developers were aiming for. I enjoy it.

You need internet to play the game even in single player which could be annoying and trust me, you will be spending more time in online. As of now, the online racing in about doing linkups but I believe they are going to fix it.

All in all it is a nice game. Under no circumstances perfect but nice. It needs more work, more polishing, more options. Just give it time. The game has potential. While it would be unfair to compare it to the previous games, I believe it could be what NFS World could not. We'll see if it lives up to it.

But again, buy it on sale and create save backups.",1691522898,1691711319,True,9,0,0.61056971549987793,1,True,False,False

7% Enjoyment due to several neglected quality of life settings (i.e turning fx off)
3% Actual street racing

When I started the game, the cops were the funnest part. I always loved to run from them, and push myself to escape heat 5 chases while being in a lower tier car (Like A or A+). However as I started to play more, I just wanted the ability to do races, deliveries, and get more money so I can start focusing on completing the story and upgrading my car. The game purposefully places police in places to just annoy the player. (In the several cases that I've seen: Spawning heli's out of literal thin air (without you're in a chase or out of one), annoying undercover camaro's that camp every event, the fact that heli's have a forced 100% spawn chance after completing a takeover mission (literally spawns a heli heading straight towards you after completing a takeover), and the several other annoyances that PD brings to this game. I could be trying to go pick up a car for yaz, but then a swat car just start patrolling around the area and body guarding it. Also, the AI is rigged to be unfair towards the player, which is also extremely annoying (I.e: police cars will sometimes randomly perform U-turns in the middle of the street and begin heading towards the player from several streets away). Also, this isn't a major concern, and the last thing someone looks at when it comes to an NFS game, is immersion. However, I find the fact that you can't disable utterly impractical routes from the GPS. Sometimes maybe I wanna take the correct way to the place I'm trying to reach, and not be given the directions of going into oncoming traffic to get there (similar to how games like GTAV will show the player the correct way to get to a location, without the using of improper lane travel). Just one more thing to add onto immersion, the police. There are so many things wrong with the police that it BLOWS my mind. If I actually went and explained everything wrong with PD it would be a story book, so I'll just list them off:

Driving on the wrong side of road during a chase
Complete neglect to locals (which usually leads to them damaging more property and killing a mother of four in her minivan, more than the player would)
The absolute most irrational acceleration of the PPVs (A Raptor F-150 (the NFS S.W.A.T car) should be INCAPABLE of accelerating to 0 - 100 in an average of about 2.5 - 3 seconds. The fact that this car is also able to confidently keep up with a S rank ferrari is beyond me. (The same can be said for the Corvette and Camaro PPV)
Finally, the Camaro ""Handbrake Technique"". Does it look badass? Yes. Is it something that would ultimately lead to the driver of the Camaro being turn apart as the car would rip through the car after E-Braking in front of a car traveling 170mph+, yes.

I know I said that would be the last thing, but I have one more... WHY ARE THERE ROAD SIGNS FACING TOWARDS THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC. Once again, I know it's just a game, and I know that its NFS, so I'm not expecting the ""realistic scale"" on this to be very high. But it's almost like the people who made Lakeshore, build the roads for the purpose of driving on the incorrect side. (i.e: Posted speed limits and sharp curve warning signs face towards both correct, and incorrect lanes of travel, as if they wanted to give a heads up to the people that are driving on the wrong side). 

btw the multiplayer is pretty ight. Quite literally the only enjoyable aspect of this game besides customizing cars. :skull:x8",1691638598,1691638598,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It reminded me of all the good memories I had when I was a kid playing nfs underground. I really like the new art design, it goes well the game's arcade design. Driving mechanics are diverse and simple, but sometimes it feels lacking. The way you use your nitro makes all the difference. I do not even want to talk about cops in this game. There is no way developers played their own game and thought that these cop chases are just pure joy. If you want to make some additional money(you need a lot of money in general) to experience the other cars you need to do lots of races, which raises your heat level. The more heat level you have, more beefier cops you face and harder it is to escape. I finished almost every night with heat level 5(max) and at some point I almost rage quit and deleted the game. The cop chases are a nice addition in low levels, it keeps you on your toes, but after a little amount of time, you end up trying to escape cops more than you race, which is super annoying. There are lots of connectivity and rendering issues in online. Sometimes people start teleportating all over the place and the experience is never consistent. You do not know if you won the race by luck(enemies experiencing technical issues) or by skill. In my opinion. because EA being the money worshippers that they are, some cars are inherently better than others regardless of its score and modifications, and the game is trying to encourage(strongly suggest) you to buy the game pass.

I understand that this game is done by a different company than did Need for Speed heat. I get that. Still does not justify releasing an unfinished game at 70 bucks. I have spent many hours on this game. Partially because I want a decent racing game since I have a force feedback wheel and pedal system, and partially because I had faith that this development company would come to their senses about what they needed to do next.

Pros: 

1. They have improved on the tier system from Heat Adding tier B, A, A+, S, and S+. This addition made sense so that people do not race super cars every race like HEAT. This was a major improvement on HEAT's system. Unfortunately this was the only improvement this company made on the Need For Speed recipe. 

Cons: (Beware there are many)

1. They took away the ""HEAT"" mechanic in multiplayer. By far one of the most enjoyable elements of NFS HEAT was switching between sanctioned races during the day to unsanctioned Heat generating races in the evening with your crew. This was the most exciting part of multiplayer and immediately made my crew want to not play this game. Out of a crew of 8 or so people who bought this game only two of us still play, shit only two of us have over 10 hours in the game. Eventually they replaced the lack of multiplayer HEAT mechanic  with ""SUPER LAME"" events that generate ""Heat"" over 5 rounds............worse thing they could have ever done, the developers are so out of touch with players. The impact was they took people out of their already dead racing ques to participate in what is an extremely boring event that takes quite a while and when you have 5 HEAT you can instantly join a race and it falls off, so no true struggle to get away from the cops. JUST PATHETIC HONESTLY.

2. 16 player servers????? WTF is this???? Its hard enough to get 4 people in a race as is. Its like you have never heard of server layers. WoW solved this problem close to 20 freaking years ago you savages... Create quick match ques that ricochet across 6 clusters or so. What is the problem here? This game consists of server jumping until you can find people who are even willing to race. Its worse when you get really good at the game because after the first race half of your que will leave. Me and my crew are almost forced to start each heat racing the ""rental"" in each tier so people wont just immediately leave. The developers should have some hidden algorithm or stats they take on their players so they can group the more skilled, winning, and experienced players with each other, or have them sign up for a ranked server experience. This helps with player retention, its helps new players feel not immediately dominated and experienced players feel an ever growing challenge, all games have figured this out but NFS Unbound. I waste soooooo much of my time looking for a race that the developers have to watch out losing their player base because it seems they do not respect our time. I do not want to spend 30 minutes looking for races in your freaking racing game they should be immediately available.  Then they add their terrible event that pulls even more people out of their racing ques so it seems to be a dead space. Total failure on this front.

3. Art direction is less than desirable.  I don't care for the childish cartoon like animations, as many others have said....give us the ability to turn it off and improve our games performance. This also grows your player base to people who could then play on a lesser performing device.

4. The music is not varied at all, all the same sub par hip hop sounding songs....Had to turn it off probably in the first 2 hours. 

5. they pretty much destroyed drifting and in my personal opinion made the builds way weaker than grip builds even in the early tiers. This made certain friends of mine who pre-purchased the game at 70 dollars literally not want to play. So your change in design from ""HEAT"" pushed 50% of the people I knew who were excited enough to pre-purchse this game at 70 freaking dollars out of your playing population. 

6. they took away the mechanic of ""Bot Filling"" a race that was not full. so if there are only 3 racers that joined in multiplayer then you race against only them instead of adding 5 bots. It makes the races feel empty. This didn't bother me immediately, but bothered 3 of my friends who will never turn the game on again because of this flaw and other flaws in development. 

7. It feels they introduced a bit of politics and public opinion into the game. EX: (Some of the NPC's are walking around with masks on outside. It feels like the developers, during a very sensitive time, were pandering to certain political and public opinion perspectives surrounding masking and vaccines) I don't know why developers feel the need for this. I don't play video games to engage in your politics, I play video games to participate in an escape from reality, and so do most of my friends. We all have differing political views and honestly we come to an online gaming forum as if it were any IRL meeting place. So let me ask you developers a question. What are the three things never to be brought up at the bar or another other place of social congress??? Religion, Politics, and money. These are the things that everyone has an opinion on, but no one totally agrees. Leave that shit out of your game. This is a racing game, like wtf??? Why would you want to limit your target population? Piss Poor marketing if you ask me. Most of us would appreciate if you could keep politics, religion, and other dividing topics out of the gaming sphere. We prefer to gather and just have fun.

8. The engine builds, though I have had fun with them, my more experienced friends who are car people think that the engine building is nonsensical. Engine tiers and points seem to not matter as they should and there seems to be a hint of ""Magic"" as to why one vehicle is uber dominant in one tier or another. 

9. Originally money was more difficult to come by. I appreciated this. I am also a freak who loves to torture himself with the likes of FROMSOFT titles and other Soulsborne clones. It felt like a hard grind to get your vehicles, and yes the grind was a bit much and I understand why some in the community complained. Here is the problem, the developers made money not matter now with the extreme changes made to currency availability. 

So the most important mechanics other than racing (which takes forever to get in a heat and half of the people leave after the first race) in the game, money and ""HEAT"", basically don't matter now. I cant lie, I still play this game with the one other person who will play it with me.

This is NOT the case with this game. 
Their arbitrary increase of time playing the game with the Police chases is the most INFURIATING FUCKING THING THEY HAVE EVER DONE. The absolute CONSTANT cop chases, over and over and over. The game is UNPLAYABLE when you reach heat 5, which in the later stages of the story happens in 2 - 3 races, thanks to their ""heat"" increase on the races and the ""Cop Chase Resuming"" which is the ABSOLUTELY funnest mechanic I think they have added *sarcasm intended*. 
Nothing like being forced into another cop chase right....? Right?! 
Honestly, who ever signed off, and designed the police had one thing in mind, ""How can I waste the players time?""

Like most AAA studios; the graphics are fine, the world is just the right size and you have more than enough cars to choose from. This is expected for it's asking price yet it proves not to be enough for a game to be fun or challenging in any way. 


So, why a negative review? Well:

The characters are insufferable: You will probably never be able to hear the word 'bro' again in any capacity after partaking in this endeavor for more than a few hours. The characters feel like a simulation of what senior devs would speculate a younger person talks like in 2023. The police radio is probably the most amusing thing in the audio department, offering at least some decent voice acting. (luckily you'll be listening to that a lot) 

The AI: Has a built in springs that they can activate to instantly reach 400 mp/h while teleporting through corners. This not only makes races harder but also significantly impact the police's ability to keep your tail. 

The story-line: Contains not much more information than a children's book. The introduction was fun and in a way unexpected, the rest fell flat quickly. As a positive, there is so much police that you will never end up racing anyways. 

The content: Far and few in between, there are many races to do but many will be similar in characteristics. Luckily there are many alternative ways to earn your cash, like ? or ? and ? !

The online experience: After thinking that the FH5 lobbies were in a graveyard, this game has punished those false beliefs. At least I can tell you that there will be plenty of in-game AI players accompanying you, ranging from a rank of 1-5 stars. 

The racing itself: Apart from the rewarding feeling you get when slamming shift right at the three golden bars, there is little of skill to be had here. Drifting, shortcuts or take-downs are barely rewarded in comparison to driving as an advertisement for your insurance company. On the bright side, each police takedown earns you a temporary max nitro boost. 

The finance: Horrible. Grinding many races for some barely improving upgrades or new car is ridiculous and takes out a lot of the fun. The entry fees for this game are a decent approach to mix things up, if only that meant getting more decent returns. (You are risking some decent money after all) There is nothing like crawling slowly to your safe-house when being under the influence of fear from the AI in this game. 

The music/sound design: There is a lot of 'noise' in the game that drawns out the revs of the car itself, so much so in fact, that it becomes almost impossible to shift because the phone conversations are at volume 1000 while being turned down to 20 percent in settings. I wish there was more focus on street noise or the cars (sirens).  

The physics interactions: Remember when in NFS underground you could destroy some crazy structures and knew when the end was nearing while heading towards a barrier? No more of that in this game, there is little that separates a 'takedown' of yourself in relativity to the object you are hitting. A big lamp post, you can drive over no problem, but then when a car hits you in a micron the wrong way, you make four back-flips and lose the race/chase with full guarantee. 


Some much needed positives then: 

The customization: What is better than 'slow car now goes fast'? This game allows you to make any car competitive with a wide range of upgrades to choose from. Any advantage over the police is a good line in my book, don't forget to add the special perks keeping them at bay.  

The controls: It takes some getting used to but the way they implement the drifting/grip ratio in comparison to their previous games feels more natural and predictable. Predictable means not always going straight all the time, it is more then possible to magically drift at 150 mp/h, ending up crashing into some bullshit barrier while being chased by police. This game is perfectly playable on a controller, keyboard or wheel.  

The open world: Has a good balance of size to emptiness ratio. There is enough variation in the world to keep you busy for a while in terms of jumps, vegetation & police.

The art style (very subjective): Personally really enjoyed the contrast with the cell shading animations and 'real life' looking assets. They are not too bombastic and actually can enhance the feeling of going quick despite being stuck at 50 mp/h in some tight corner. Sadly the police are not really animated that well. 


It is important to be realistic and not expect much to be added/changed looking at the current state of it's release. This game's mixed reviews represent exactly what this game is good at: creating a cluster**** regarding you actually think about it. 

Can you get the game on sale for +- 20 bucks? Go for it! Buy it full price? Never! EA, fix your shit bro.",1685290910,1691284148,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is dull and watered down, does nothing to appeal to the older NFS community; its basically tamed, scaled down version of NFS and  woke rhetoric nonsense for kids. The gameplay isn't great either, you mostly spend most of the time running from the police instead of actually racing so you basically have to calculate your race restarts according to your wanted level and hope for the best. The online was buggy in the beginning, but manageable( music cut out sometimes, some graphical errors, textures took longer to load). After the latest update disaster struck and game became pretty unplayable and unbearable  at times due to frequent crashes, parts of the map despawning or not loading, phasing through the map, falling through it, roads/buildings despawning in freeroam and races, getting confused and losing races  because of it, losing money won from linkups because my cars fall through the map, then i respawn and can't go anywhere so i get busted(lost ~400k so far because of it). I also got the eaplay because i wanted to try the m3gtr and the nissan kit, its not working because i got it off the eastore and i read somewhere you have to buy it on both steam and eastore, i tried contacting ea about it and all these game breaking bugs , but ....*THEIR SUPPORT SITE AND FORMS ARE POSITIVELY TRASH* . I assure you skeptical reader that i have a pc perfectly capable of running the newest games on ultra.  Now you may wonder why did i play it if i encountered all those errors, its because i miss the illicit character and the underground races, the ridiculous widebodies and kits ; but i am getting pretty sick of the state it's in at the moment. Now... would i recommend the game? In general... not really, it seems rushed, superficial, unfinished even, marketed towards younger players, its lacking in personality, the online still has long ways to go and i feel like they haven't invested enough  in it. If i think its worth getting the game at this very moment in time? no, not with a 80% discount, its a very poor experience and very poor maintenance of a product that's only a pale shadow of what NFS was and what it was a gold standard for racing games, for underground races, for gaming products.
I think we're watching ea go down the drain.

Here i am revising my review, losing around ~500k at this point to cops because roads despawn i fall through and then the car won't start, absolute garbage support and garbage support website, garbage game filled with glitches, crappy mechanics, mediocre maintanance .

game is fun

until the end

its not worth 60 quid, let alone 30, its like they tried to mimic forza with all the choice and races you could do, but none of them are actually interesting

races vary in money giving and racing for a car just seemed like a waste of money, im not going to do a buy in for 100 grand and win just to get an aston martin db5, and be 100 grand out of pocket.

upgrading vehicles gets boring quickly, i never bothered to experiment and just went with what i knew worked

playing on the hardest difficulty is basically like getting punched in the nuts every 5 minutes 
i did not feel an incentive to buy any vehicles, most of them were far too expensive/ were not worth buying, all the cars i bought were just an RX-7, ferrari 458 italia and the ferarri pisca, moment i beat the game and got my large sum of money i fixed up a merc i stole from ASAP and that was it

grip cars are useless and drifting, while fun is a chore and doesn't give any speed benefits what so ever

rubber banding on harder difficulties make no sense, i did a race once and basically never saw the top 3, first place was 2 miles away from me and that number just kept increasing

cop chases were fun at first but became annoying pretty quickly, level 5 chases, despite meaning to be a big challenge, were nothing but just drive around like a maniac and out speed everything

I got this game on free weekend back in July, I ended up playing roughly 20 hours over the course of that free weekend, at which point I figured I undeniably had reason enough to buy the game and continue. On that note, I certainly think my money has been well spent, there's alot to go over for such an established franchise as NFS, but I wanted to break things down into the core components. Mainly the story, racing, and cop chasing. That's what we're here for right?

PROS:
- Cop chases feel more risky, due to liquidatable income cop chases are actually threatening and meant to be avoided, In most wanted pursuits were mainly instigated by the player just to farm bounty rep. Its nice that the police are a threat.
- The story and characters are alright, I will say the writing leaves something to be desired but this is one of the first NFS games to actually have unique characters with motivations and interests, I cannot deny I was endeared to Rydell by the end. The stakes are set and understood early on and its fun the whole way through.
- Races feel more significant, players can no longer spam restarts for a perfect run and the difficult racer AI adds to the feeling of a cutthroat underground racing scene. This game can actually be quite difficult at times and in the case of some of the S+ tracks, have some of the most intensive focus-demanding gameplay in any NFS game (which is essentially dodging traffic and not losing traction at 200+mph) 
- The visuals, customization, and presentation is pretty top notch aswell, I originally was turned off by the silly car effects but quickly learned they can be swapped out for basic smoke trails which is a nice option for purists or oldies. This also ties into the well realized rival characters and side characters, there is certainly more here narratively to sink your teeth into than any of the older games had with their pseudo action-movie homage aesthetics.

CONS
- While chases are more threatening, actually engaging in chases isnt as fun, Cops have braindead AI and it seems like the optimal way to escape is to simply drive as fast as you can in a straight line, the cops will either fall behind or inevitably wreck themselves. A big reason why the chases are this way is due to there being no pursuit breakers, but thats not something worth talking about as it wont be patched in.
- While Races are more significant feeling, there is a significantly lower variety of races to be had, essentially Drift, Circuit, Sprint, and Takeovers with some variation on the track layouts/style. This does lead to some repetition and is very disheartening as older NFS games had many unique and fun race types, like Tollbooth, Outrun, Lap Elimination, Drag, ect.
- While the story is good, there are some serious stumbles. Including a massive missed opportunity to flesh out some details in the games 3rd week and never revealing the games main antagonist for the entirety of the story (wtf Criterion) overall if you aren't turned off by the youthful jargon and slang. There's alot to enjoy, It's a new game for a new generation and for the most part, I'm here for it.",1691137264,1691137264,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously, the cops really suck the fun out of this already mediocre game. I don't mind the grind, I can look past the shitty tier system, I can even ignore the tacky effects, but the frustration of having to deal with absurdly unfair cops almost all the fucking time is what made me hate this game.

Customization is IMO the best part of the game, but even that has it's flaws.

The fitment on some of cars is atrocious. Also why are some of the front ends lifted? And why can't we adjust track width? You also get auto negative camber when lowering ride height, which is kind of annoying.

You like Toyota and Audi? Well too bad, you don't get any.

Wheel selection is tiny. You like retro wheels? You're shit outta luck. You don't get any of that either.

You also cannot adjust tire width and they get really funky for some cars esp for the Chevy Bel Air where all but one wheel set is so much more wider on the front which looks dumb af.

Tier system also severely limits the freedom you can have with builds which kinda sucks.

Even more limiting is the fact that all the cars already have set stats which make them better for either drift or grip. You want to make a grip build RX7 for S and S+ class? Too bad, it's still gonna be slipping all over the place no matter how much you build it for grip coz the game just predetermined it as a drift car.

And while we're talking about drifting, it's horrible. Drifting physics is weird and just doesn't feel right no matter what I do with the build and the settings. I just gave up and ignored all drifting events altogether. I've played crappy mobile games with better drifting physics than this.

I'll give it some pros too tho. It looks great, it ran flawlessly on my Ryzen 5 5600G and RTX 3060 with only 2 or 3 crashes on 300+ hours of gameplay, some of the racing is actually fun when you're not being trashed by the cops, and you have mods for PC that fixes a lot of the issues I mentioned, which is really what made this game bearable for me otherwise I would've quit playing halfway thru story mode, but good luck trying to get these mods to work after a game update.

I jumped in with really low expectations and there's a lot I can forgive and I tried to like this game, like I really gave it a chance, but instead of just being able to casually enjoy a dumb arcade racing game I end up with regret and disappointment.

I do not recommend buying this game. If you really have to, buy it 70% off. Or better yet just play Forza Horizon.

UPDATE: POS game just stopped working. EA app wouldn't launch at all even without mods. Wouldn't even let me uninstall it so I could reinstall.

Graphics are great, map is good, driving feels good, customisation works well but lacks variety, diversity is remarkably good for a racing game, story is okay. Also the soundtrack is kinda ass. 7/10

After the three previous games, I didn't have the highest of hopes for Unbound, which I know is built off of Heat's engine, however, I was in fact pleasantly surprised.

The graphics look great, albeit need a somewhat beefy GPU to really shine. The driving effects and cel-shaded characters are controversial, but give the game a distinct visual identity, and I personally really like them, as they fit the overall vibe and even enhance it, making the game less bland. I do feel the overall visual tones of 2015's NFS felt a bit better, but overall I'd say Unbound is the better looking one.

Next, the map, it felt well designed and alive, a massive upgrade from especially Heat which felt bland and unfinished. Unbound's map also has a good amount of variety in locations and types of road, blended well together into a coherent and nice-feeling experience. The highways are long enough and have enough traffic to be fun to do speed races on, while the city area's verticality and tight corners also make for their own kind of fun experience, and the map is large enough to accommodate all it's different areas well enough. My only major complaint would be that the actual map/minimap is a bit difficult to navigate in the city area with vertical roads, and some highway interchanges are hard to see on the minimap. I think this could be remedied by giving the map a slight 3D effect to allow seeing height differences. I would love to see a  bigger map especially with longer highways, but that's only a minor thing and I wouldn't call it an issue, as the map is already pretty huge.

Moving on, the cars also feel fun to drive, and while the physics are quite different from older games like 2005's Most Wanted, it must be remembered that this is not 2005's Most Wanted, and in this game's context, the driving model works well. I do have a few minor issues though, mainly that grip cars feel a bit too understeery at times. Drifting is still clearly the priority, and i'd like to see a slight buff to grip builds in the future. On a more positive note though, Unbound is one of the few modern games that manages to capture a sense of speed well, although i'd like to see it taken up a notch still, as the B and A classes still feel a tad slow.

Continuing on the topic of cars, the customisation features work in basically the same way as in Heat, which is a perfectly fine system that doesn't really need many changes. while I personally don't usually like how bumper deletes look, I do like that it is an option, and wish it'd also extend to hood deletes and be available on more cars. However, I feel the customisation lacks variety, and for example customising a Skyline, there were several options available for quite similar wings, but not a single lip or ducktail spoiler. I'd also like to see more variety in tail/headlight designs, and for example options for blowers or turbos sticking out of the hood on some cars. Body kits are a bit better when it comes to this, but those too could use a bit more variety, as they're largely either Rocket Bunny style ones, or very busy designs with lots of ""sticky-outy bits"" so to say everywhere, and more clean or even DTM or GT3 inspired kits would be appreciated. Another complaint I have is that the livery editor still feels very clunky to use, and I'd love to see for example as an ""advanced mode"" the ability to edit on a flat unwrapping of the car's texture rather than directly on the car. Ideally the ability to import vector graphics directly would be great, but due to the moderation efforts required especially with a community as (unfortunately) toxic as the Need for Speed one I can understand why that isn't a feature.

When it comes to performance customisation, I largely like the way it's implemented, and the garage upgrade mechanic is a great way to gate progression a bit. I do also like that the Heat-style thing where you'd have to do high-heat races to unlock the best parts was dropped, as it got very tedious towards the end in Heat. One thing I would like would be the ability to tune gearing, as for example my Skyline build tops out due to the engine redlining in 7th gear, which intuitively would indicate that i'd want to adjust gearing for higher top speed, but that isn't possible. Tangentially related to performance customisation, I also feel like turbo and supercharger whine should be more noticeable in the engine sound.

Still on the car topic, the car selection is definitely better than in previous games, having a decent amount of classic tuners etc. rather than just supercars, however I'd love to see it taken further with more ""normal"" cars available, along the lines of, say, a Mazda 6 or an Audi S4, to illustrate what I mean. Where I live there's also a fair bit of car culture around European wagons such as Audi A4 Avants or BMW's 3-series wagons, which I think could use some representation. The progression system did also do a good job of gating supercars towards the end of the game, unlike in for example Forza Horizon games where by earlygame you're already driving an Aventador or something.

Moving on from the cars and onto another customisable thing in the game, your character. The system for this as well is carried over from Heat, and works well enough mechanically, however the options available lack variety even more so than the car customisation. Many items available feel more like something you'd see at a fashion show than what people would actually wear, and for example hair colour lacks options, which I assume is to render nicer in the cel-shaded style and that part I can excuse due to that (although a pure white hair colour would be nice to see). To illustrate the lack of variety, there is a pile of sweatpants and shorts that look near identical, but only one skirt, which is only available in one colour. At least it's a relatively normal style and not something nonsensical. Shoes are another example, piles of sneakers but barely any boots, etc. I think in a game focusing this much on personal expression this is not a great look. However, on a much more positive note that makes me appreciate the game much more is the complete detaching of voice, body type, and clothing options, at least from what I could see (I haven't tried making a character with a masculine body type yet). This to my knowledge makes NFS Unbound one of the first racing games with actually good transgender and in general gender diverse representation, alongside Forza Horizon 5. While personally I also liked the available body types, they could use more diversity in height and overall size, as most seemed to be relatively slim average height people, but what the game has available already is incredibly good for the genre.

As a last non-spoiler thing, a very subjective part, the soundtrack was a massive disappointment. There were a couple of good tracks, but most felt very generic and and the playlist was nowhere near long enough. While most tracks pass as listenable background music, some were in my opinion just horrendous, and most don't really fit the energetic street racing vibe at all. There are a few tracks that are a great fit though, namely the more techno-y ones such as Umek's Cryptic Speech which is an absolute banger, as is buku's Front to back, but unfortunately these are an exception to the rule. A lot of the soundtrack would work better as menu music in the car meets and garage, but not as racing/driving music. I also think the soundtrack could use variety and the ability to choose genres, like Forza Horizon 5's radio stations, or the EA Trax feature in old NFS games.

I would talk about the story but I ran out of characters lmao. In short, it was clichéy but decent.",1690949065,1690949065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't really describe them in an essay so here is a list of the pros and cons:

+ The addition of the Burst Nitrous allows the game to feel even faster and makes drifting cars more viable in races
+ The art direction and style are just amazing and unique, its something worth experiencing personally
+(?) The race separation in tiers allow races to be in the intended difficulty, heavily grinding and maxing out the car to breeze through the story is not viable anymore, B-Tier cars can race in B rank races, A-Tier cars on A rank races
+ the cosmetics look pretty cool and add so much to the feel of the races despite being just cosmetics
+ supplies tips for dealing with certain police vehicles whenever your heat level raises which are pretty useful

- you unlock cosmetics by doing challenges, making the game feel very grindy
- Mandatory Cop chases after each non-takeover
- Drifting simultaneously feels slippery and stiff
-(pt1) There is no safe way to earn money
-(pt2) You gain heat too quickly, causing you to purposefully earn too little money, or deal with threats you probably cant handle (might be a personal problem though)
- no inventory system like the previous game
- the music is not good and all feel samey
- limited retries (failing a qualifier sends you back to the previous day)

A lot of the customization is tied into the online mode which I wish they made more variety's for single player.

Now to what I didn't like, the writing. The writing is just absolutely atrocious, it comes off as a bunch of out of touch 30 yr olds that got the job through nepotism. Characters dog on each other for no reason and in the most unfunny way possible, you honestly wouldn't even assume they were jokes if it weren't for the characters having to basically laugh track it for you. One character couldn't be older than 45 but is treated like a senile technologically impaired old person. Honestly just skip every cutscene, it'll save your eyes rolling into the back of your head. The difficulty is weird, as in if you have a car that wants to drift you'll never outrun the inevitable police chase, but if you have a race car you'll be okay. Here's another problem the game forces you to keep your old shitty cars to maintain these low tier races that are shoehorned in LONG past you ever even needing them. So if you're like me and sell you shit cars after your first upgrade you're up the creek without a paddle.

Where this game really excels is in the online mode. They give you a hefty amount of cash to get started, you'd think doing races is the best method of gaining money and experience, that's not the case as the public quest things are where you get the most juice. I really enjoy the public events only ever had one bug out on me but nothing really lost.

- I like the racing aspects
- I like the maps

Things I don't like
- Cops are dumb as hell

- I hate the repairing system (kinda)
- No drag race like NFS Underground 2
- No drifting race like NFS Underground 2

- God awful controls and handling despite being given the opportunity to balance these settings. You could change them anyway you want and see ZERO difference in how the cars operate.
-AI are tanks. If they hit you just turn the game off, you wont be able to do a thing about it BUT if you hit them, there is no reaction.. they just continue on like a little bug hit the windshield and not a several ton vehicle. This goes for the AI police in this game, 
-Story is mediocre along with characters and their respective dialogue,
-You arent able to upgrade your first car at all until a certain point in the game (Funnily enough after you reach that 2 hour mark.....)

The anime effects turned me off from buying the game for a while, but on a summer sale I took the chance and was pleasantly surprised how polished the game is, and how well anime integrates into a NFS game. 

Great soundtrack with the exception of a few terrible choices for racing. 

Typical story for a NFS game but also decent. 

Lots and lots of cars, and lots of customization. 

The real Meta of this game, at least in story mode, is to overpower a car for its tier so its 0-60 time is as low as possible. Then you gimp it in top speed (ala smaller gear box, additional downforce, etc). If you tweak your cars right, B, A, A+ and S tier races will be hilariously easy. This means heavy cars/trucks aren't great for anything but B tier (which is basically slow-motion racing).

Also, in takedowns and drift events you can keep your multiplier up by tapping the nitro constantly when not drifting. This will allow you to get first without trying.

The only two weak points with this game are the number of race tracks available at first (but a lot more become available as higher tiers open, including a couple offroad races), and the absolute bats#it crazy police that have been granted magical powers and thoroughly abuse them.

The story prologue is also quite long for a NFS game, but makes sense once completed. 

They tried really hard to mimic the feel of 2005's NFS Most Wanted but they dialed down some of the arcade aspects, which is a shame. I really miss slamming into barricades and sending multiple cop cars flying in slow motion. Luckily in Unbound you CAN slam into individual cop cars at high speeds and watch them crash/fly with satisfaction while you take no damage in the process. Sadly, even touching a normal car in traffic while accelerating sends YOU spiralling/crashing into the air with glass and metal flying everywhere. 

Unbound also spawns in police helicopters or undercover cars at the most inopportune times, and will literally spawn traffic in your path during races so you crash 20 feet from the finish line and have to use up a Restart. A lot of these cheating tactics by the game feel entirely contrived and unfair, even for a NFS game. To put it bluntly, this game has the AI of a 1990's arcade game designed to milk you of your quarters. That said, it also makes the game hilarious at times when the AI pwns itself by accident. Like most NFS fans, I have a love-hate attitude towards the AI since it behaves like a psychopath with Alzheimers.

Apart from the mentally deranged police and the love-it-or-hate-it AI that will eventually have you yelling out loud (cheap therapy), this game gets a thumbs up from me. Probably one of the better NFS games to-date.",1689135350,1690752755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Okay so after playing for several hours (i nearly finished it it's short) i'll try to keep this as spoiler free as much as possible as best as i can so here we go.

QUICK BRIEF NOTE
As a lover of racing games and simulators, for starters i had quite the issues with this one and it took me several times to stop this game from crashing (15 - 30min gameplay) after the game itself of so many updates (yes i have modern PC with all updates possible). The cartoon artwork was very distracting for me and i had to use black silver settings style so i could play normal for a start and I don't know about you but if the option could be turned off that would be great.

CUT SCENES & TUTORIAL
Normally i never skip a cut scene but belive me you will want to (even i struggled to watch oof ouch) because there's so much cringe in here.
The game starts with the car of your choice (i strongly recommend lambo) and you race and grind your money up to 37000$ to 39.000$ but don't spend it or do up to you.
Once you earn that you can only guess what happens next (not going to spoil it if you want to play it).

MAP & ACTIVITIES
The map is huge (so it seems) than Heat and it has 260 Collectibles (100 Bears, 80 Street Art, and 80 Billboards) and 160 Activities (30 Speed Runs, 45 Long Jumps, 35 Drift Zones, 50 Speed Traps). But without keys to the map DLC they are hard to find. If you get the Keys To The Map, then you will have A LOT of work to do as you will get so many icons like you would say ''Oh Wtf is this'' . That’s 420 locations total. You don't get much rewards from cash if you decide to complete these things.

STORY MODE
Story itself well is 19 - 28h long depending on your play style (with collectibles or not) you got 4 weeks and racing by day does not give you that much earning than racing in evenings. The start can be hard at first and when i started to play it took me 4 or 5 replays to get the handle of the game on relaxed mode. So if you're going to attempt on hard i don't know how much AI difficulty is on steroids but it does get easy later once you get better car & parts. Once i got the handle of it i could save so much money during the first week that i actually spend garage updates to gold and for car parts to A rating. So when you race save money that's all because you don't get much so grind whatever you can.

POLICE CHASES
When you finish a race you get heat from 0.5 to 2.0 so just be on a lookout here. Or if you love to collect all collectibles in peace you can do it at day with 0 heat in peace. As your heat gets higher after races just avoid 5 star jeep and also get that reinforced thing so your car can get a lot of damage and also later on an upgrade so cops can spot you slower. The cops are dumb honestly so once you avoid heat level 5 cars and being chased by the chopper just park somewhere and turn off engine and wait. I was expecting more here since escaping 5 star was so easy.

CONTROLS
I had quite the issue here oof okay. I plugged in my Playstation 5 controller and mapping was so confusing i mean whoever designed those controls should get fired. So if you have issues with that just go to big screen in Steam and in NFS Unbound icon click controller and select ''Enable Steam Input''. The big screen mode should recognize as PS controller but then again you will see Xbox controls in game.

PERFORMANCE 
The release version was okay as i played for several hours but after couple of updates oof ouch it went bad and here's why.
The game started to crash within 10minutes to a range of 45min and then 1hour. So even starting steam or EA app as admin with DX11 launch option forcing thingy the game still crashed. Okay so i checked the updates all was fine, then i checked the drivers all was fine. I reverted to the previous GPU driver game would still crash but within 2h so i was close. I checked the events log with critical and warning logs and started command prompt as admin to find the errors and fix those in windows powershell as admin. Started the game again i played to a range of 1h to 2h and half and crashed again. Malware? Virus? Trojan? Nope all was cleaned so i decided for final step. Opened up PC and cleaned it, checked out if thermal paste was worn but it was still brand new pasted. The final fix for me was fresh install of everything after i cleaned it (even tho PC was cleaned like a month ago). Final thing i did was installed MSI Afterburner and tweaked GPU power settings to 50% and tempeture at 71%. I played the game for 6 - 7h straight without crashes. So i guess that's a temporary fix until this game updates and fixes to a stable version (if that will ever happen)

DLC
Not worth it just don't so only DLC i'd get is Key's To The Map so you can collect those stuff quick and easy without free roaming. Reason for this is because you can unlock that BMW later in game by racing the events to win cars & get all collectibles to unlock the rest of the clothes and vehicles. Clothing DLC is either a hit or miss depending on your style but that's about it. If you have EA Play Pro then you will normally get all of that DLC but NOT key's to the map so bare that in mind. Just trying to make you guys save money to see what you get and what not.

GAMEPLAY
Well you grind a lot especially collectibles but at least they could pay more for events at least. Week 4 you only get 200.000$ and a car but the rest of the races are poorly paid so you're feeling like you're forced to play night races with bigger payouts.
Cartoon effects are distracting for me but that could not be for you in some cases so i was hoping for turn off feature here. Cops are dumb and easy to avoid so this also needs a fix as i don't like stuff to be too easy. It might be different for you but honestly you will see once you get the handle of things it really is that easy from races to cop chases.
Gameplay itself is well just to pass the time really but i was expecting more but overall is jut pretty much repetitive (race, deliver, collectibles cop chase, upgrade repeat).

ONLINE
I don't play online so i prefer NFS titles to play solo as it is. Experience may be different for you but to me i just don't play this title online. The only one is Forza Horizon with friends but not NFS (besides most wanted 2005 R.I.P. servers)

FINAL THOUGHTS
Well i got the game because i love NFS series and also because i am NFS collector but i knew after Carbon & Pro Street it would just be going downhill and sadly Unbound is like more than just rock bottom here and i'm pretty sure the next NFS won't be any different or i could be wrong who knows. It may be for the kids but to some people like me would really want Underground 1, 2 & Most Wanted 2005 Remaster or Remake. Sadly few years later we still did not get this.
For me this game is too short and performance is not good on modern PC's until it gets the right fix and patch to a stable version.
So if you read this far then god bless you and hope you will have fun this one because i sure did not.

DO I RECOMMEND?
No i don't but then again i don't recommend it for several reasons of what i wrote above and if you want to buy this game is your money. What i do recommend is to watch the gameplay first before you decide or try it before you spend any money on it.

SCORE 
3/10
I enjoyed NFS Heat with 6/10 score.

For starters, the whole thing feels like a blander version of Heat as far as the challenges go, although if you're into repetition and torture then this wouldn't really be an issue for anyone looking to play this, Visual fidelity is considerably better and it does have a lot of thought and soul put into it, the handling overall of most cars are also pretty hecking satisfying and i really like the turbo system it has a bunch, but that wears off super quickly after you realize how fucking cumbersome and rigged the game ends up being if you play it past its silly prologue.

That being said this hellhole of cop chase after cop chase after cop chase: The Racing Game doesn't really have a normal difficulty setting for you. You either have Plenty of Restarts, Hard and Hardcore, that's it. You also can't fast travel either, if you are nostalgic for that feature not existing at all then this is also the game for you. Unless you are into masochism and frame perfect inputs with its rather unfair collision physics, then I wouldn't really recommend this game for anyone whatsoever.

However, even with all the negative things about the game I still had fun.

Cons:
Slow start - The early grind is really bad. Up till S rank you are not gonna make shit. Try farming collectible cars instead.
Early cop chases - Again up till S rank cop chases can be annoying.
Drift event - At least for me it was impossible to beat #1 on Intense difficulty

Pros:
Handling - Cars handle really well with the right setup, specially grip cornering with A+ and up cars.
Customization - Nothing to say it's just good
Cop chases - With S ranks you can easily outrun them and with S+ rank you can just smash them which feels good after struggling the first two weeks.
Difficulty - I really like the restart limitation on higher difficulties. Removes the save scumming and makes you not really care about perfecting every race.
Speed - It's done right. At lower ranks it's just chill racing. At S+ traffic/walls are the only things stopping you.",1690662332,1690662332,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

graphically it is impressive but so are most modern car games 

and those are pretty much the all the positives

it takes forever to get past the first week an get good cars 
the customisation is weird and not very aesthetically pleasing 
the voice acting is sloppy and the story feels very uninspired and forced 
it is the classic story similar to nfs paybacks only without any of the cool mission and any form of character development 
the jokes feel forced and unfunny 

most cars feel like boats and the driving is horrible 

gone are the days of nfs hot pursuit and most wanted where the ai was properly scripted and the physics felt actually satisfying 

the car selection is ok but games like forza do that 10 times better while still having some kind of customisation and good physics 

the takeover and drift events are bad as the driving and drifting physics seem to lack any form of inertia and conservation of energy 

overall id=f you want to get any nfs games just get the reamastered hot pursuit and most wanted or any other older game 

payback had an ok story and heat had decent physics

Pros:
- I initially didn't like the cartoonish character visuals, but after a while they really grew on me. They blend really well with the palette of colors of the rest of the game, which is nice.

- Story is nothing ground-breaking, it's the average racer-game story. Unfortunately it starts a bit slow, but as the game progresses and you pay attention more at the dialogs between the characters it gets better. 

- Talking about story, it's worth mentioning that some of the writing is EXTREMELY cringy. It's like a boomer wrote how he thinks young people talk. Many times it comes off as awkward and completely over the top, but yeah, we don't play it for the story much, do we?

- The racing experience overall is really solid. After getting the hang of the controls and understanding how each of your cars respond to your inputs, racing becomes a really enjoyable experience, which is probably the single most important thing for games such as this one.

Cons:

- The price. This game is not worth 70 euros, so don't even think buying it on full price. Imho it's worth 10-20 bucks, and that's if you like the arcady NFS style. Otherwise just buy it on EA pass and play it through that; by the end of your first subscription you'll either have finished it or completely abandon it out of boredom.

- As other people mentioned the lack of off-road missions/locations is really unfortunate, considering the fact that the few times you do get off-road, the experience is really smooth and enjoyable. A wasted potential really.

- AI is EXTREMELY scripted. The cops are there to fuck you up, and they are there just for you, and not so much for the other racers. There are many setups which you know they are meant to fuckyou up, and they are incredibly cheap. AI opponents/drivers also scripted to their bone, since depending on how much you may reattempt a race (for better time or position), they may suddenly become completely dogshit because the game feels like you need a helping hand to win the race. 

- Limiting reattempts on races is pretty dumb imho. I am not sure what happens if you burn through all your reattempts, especially in story missions, but artificially pressuring the player in order to limit their time spent on a specific mission sounds like a bad game design.

- Finally, artificially giving you a time barrier for story progression through chore-days even though it sounds good on paper, it feels like the game sends you to do erands till you 've earned your participation trophy for the story-reward. It's an impleentation choice, but I believe that they could have done it through other means as seen in previous titles (if you know, you know).",1690661427,1690661531,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And that's just fine because who needs a plot when you have cars that defy gravity, turn on a dime, and seem to be fueled by sheer absurdity? It's like the writers decided to shred the plot and use it as car fuel!

As you dive into this chaotic racing extravaganza, you'll be introduced to a motley crew of characters who seem to have escaped from a Fast & Furious spinoff directed by Monty Python. From the wise-cracking mechanic who thinks cars are his babies to the mysterious rival racer who communicates through interpretive dance - it's a parade of hilarity!

Let's talk about the cars. In ""Unbound,"" the vehicles are not just machines; they have personalities of their own. You'll witness cars that can dance the tango on two wheels, defy the laws of physics by flying like winged dragons, and spontaneously change colors like chameleons on a psychedelic trip!

The tracks in ""Unbound"" are the stuff of legend - twisted like a pretzel and designed by an architect with a love for rollercoasters. Imagine racing through a bustling cityscape where pedestrians seem to think they're in a walkathon, not realizing that their lives are one near-miss away from becoming a viral video!

And who needs traffic rules, anyway? Red lights? Pfft! Those are just suggestions. Drive as if you're auditioning for a blockbuster action movie, and the streets are your personal playground. Drift through corners like a ballerina on wheels, and let the world marvel at your impeccable lack of concern for public safety!

But wait, there's more! The power-ups in ""Unbound"" are something to behold. Forget the mundane boosts and nitrous - here, you get the ""Absurd-o-matic 3000."" Deploy it, and your car transforms into a parade float, confetti cannons and all, as you breeze past your opponents with a mix of elegance and sheer nonsense.

And let's not forget the sound design! The roar of the engines is so deafeningly awesome that it could wake up the Kraken from its nap. You'll feel the adrenaline coursing through your veins as your ears experience the sweet symphony of chaos and speed.

But amidst all the hilarity, there's a genuine sense of camaraderie in ""Unbound."" It's a celebration of the joy of racing, of pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and of laughing in the face of the sensible.

To sum it up, ""Need for Speed: Unbound"" is a game that throws the rulebook out the window and embraces the wild, the unpredictable, and the downright hilarious. It's like taking your favorite action movie, injecting it with laughing gas, and putting it behind the wheel of a rocket-powered car.

So buckle up, my friends, because ""Unbound"" will take you on a ride like no other - a journey filled with absurdity, laughter, and a whole lot of speed. Get ready to unleash your inner daredevil, break every racing convention known to humanity, and have the time of your life in this unapologetically zany racing experience!

oH MY GOD there are cops everywhere in a NEED FOR SPEED GAME!
of course its need for speed its about cops/underground racing if you don't like that go play forza or gran turismo

this is not a racing sim its arcade like and is based around running from cops and customizing cars 


The story is fun the customization is great cars don't feel like tanks like they did in heat at the start
cars do get extremely fast as you rank them

so what there is anime effects? they are not constantly there in your face they are very subtle 

graphics look good mechanics feel smooth 

people whining over the whole tournament system of using your brain to carefully choose what you do while wracking up heat  are just silly 

Hell heat 5 is not even that bad you're just bad

the game is solid maybe instead of whining about the game being bad you don't choose a game that has cops n stuff in it that is a you issue

The day/night cycles are stupid
The heat level you get during the day sticks with you until you've finished the night cycle of that day, so if you get a 5 star heat level in the day, have fun trying to even get to an event at night. Police are insanely fast, like they were in shi*ty Heat, and there's a lot of police chases
You don't over take every racer in the first 10 seconds of the race, it's designed so anyone can win (which is good) but at the same time, terrible, because if you're first, second or third and you crash, or a pr*ck copper rams your car off the road, you're now last and wont claim first place again, but that's ok because you can just restart the race.... Or can you...... ??
You get 10 restarts in each day/night cycle. I have no idea why anybody would think this would be a good idea ?

The story's good, though. Effects and characters are good, feels like you're driving at 5MPH in certain areas, maybe it's my sh*t computer.

I see a lot of people complaining about the new mechanics like limited retries, I understand the frustration, but I actually really like it. Pretty sure they did it because of the wagering which I'm meh about, but the limit also gives you a real risk/reward decision to make which gives you a bit more immersion. Also they did it without you risking nuking a campaign just because you made a bad decision mid week, as when you get to the big Sat event and you didn't collect enough money or cars then you get to start over

Such a wasted potential. Need For Speed Unbound had the potential to be EA's best modern NFS game. It had a clear view of what it wanted to be. A fun game reminding us of the greatest era in racing games, the early 00's where games like NFS Underground and Most Wanted ruled.

The vibe they created, to me at least, is amazing, when I first booted the game, I was taken aback by the vibes of the main menu itself, great track by ASAP, great visual styles, it all blended together. Then the issues started appearing and piling up fast. This game is so unsure of its own ideas that it backtracks on everything that happens within the game. SPOILER: Have your best friend betray you, ruin your employer's business and run with your car? She apologizes at the end of the game so its fiiiine.

Speaking of, the story. The story is really bad. If the ending I talked about earlier didn't cement it, then the following will. The entire game some characters act like how a millenial would think a gen z person would talk or act. It gets very cringe very fast. The only character that doesn't suffer from this is Rydell, because he is not a millenial written Gen Z. He is written as a boomer, and him referencing vines is the funniest thing I have heard in this game (again, vine? millenial stuff).

All this is manageable right? At least the gameplay is fun, right? No. The early stages of the game were the most painful few hours of my life. The cars feel so unbearable slow that I thought I was a fat person driving on a scooter through walmart. Then there's the driving itself, compared to Heat, there were so many unneccesary changes that were made, Heat felt nicer compared to this. Then there's crashing, if you're getting used to the controls, as was everyone, crashing 30 times within the same race is inevitable, this literally makes the cars feel like they're made of paper. The police mechanics suck too! Compared to the OG Most Wanted, this is dogwater policing. There is no depth with the police in this game. If you drive like a complete degenerate near a cop you'll hear ""Im willing to bet his car isn't street legal"" like?!?!? 

All of these issues are packaged together nicely with a shit tracklist. The amazing vibe created within the first minutes of booting the game with the track ""Shittin me"" by A$AP Rocky is ruined by too many underdelivering and completely trash songs like ""Booty"", ""Be a Hoe"", ""Trophy"", ""Militant"", ""Hey Neighbor!"" and ""Money"" the song everyone used to compare NFS Unbound's soundtrack to older games in the series. I don't have anything against these songs or these artists, but, these songs just don't fit the clear vibe they had established in the very first minute of the game! It's clear they either ran out of budget for decent songs, or they just flat out didn't give a crap. Some good songs from this game: ""Babushka boi"", ""Palace"", ""The God Hour"". These are some songs that I liked, and felt like they fit the vibe of the game.

The only upside and the only reason I bought this game on sale is because I liked the customization. The depth of customization is still the best feature modern NFS games have. While everything else lacks, at least this is consistently good.

Overall, this game is a 6/10. Only reason I can't refund is because I played on EA Play and when I bought it here, it gave me almost half of the achievments lmao. Good purchase and decent time if you get it on sale. This is not worth 60$. If you want great vibes, great story, great all around experience, get NFS 2015 or Heat (heat has similar issues to unbound though, mostly in terms of story and vibe)",1690462104,1690462104,False,3,0,0.564026951789855957,0,True,False,False

The cops are also ridiculously present around every corner in the entire city and you need to escape from them after almost every single race so you end up spending 70% or more of you're time playing this game running or hiding from cops. No fast travel and at the end of the game they start to take away your safe houses so you need to travel longer to go back home increases the chance that you get into more chases.

I'm a bit annoyed that you can't find a car shop to see what vehicles that are on option from the beginning. I tend to like the idea of having a goal right off the bat, especially in regards to racing to earn money to purchase vehicles.

I'm annoyed you can't really upgrade your vehicle's performance from the start either, this makes races pretty tough especially if you make one single mistake your chances at winning races go out the window.

I selected the Silvia as my starting car and find its body kit parts interesting.

The most glaring issue I have with this game is the lame chalk drawn anime style wings, manga style lines, zigzag patterns, weird circle things around the wheels and the hella lame smoke that billows out of the back of your vehicle when you drift or hit nitrous (or whatever the hell the slipstream boost nonsense is). You might think ""why not turn this off""... Here's some sad news lads, you can't. You're stuck with this ejaculation of crap from moment 1.... The best you can do is go for black smoke..... BUT it only works for your vehicle...... Yay........ [Very unamused]. This highly visible noise makes it difficult for you to see oncoming traffic as the roads are clogged with unnecessary visual crap. 

Honestly, I don't know what the devs were smoking when they came up with this visual vomit but it must have been some heavily laced stuff at that.

Talking about this nitrous nonsense, there's several different types of nitrous.... I can barely figure the bloody thing out. It's kinda annoying. 

I pretty much bought this game because I like building cars and driving them..... and it only cost me $29.90 or something like that as it was on special... I honestly don't know whether I wanna play this game or not. 

If you like racing games where you get to work on cars this game is good
if you like visual vomit that you can't turn off it's good
if you like Hispanic music (even though you can't understand a single word) it's good
if you preferred the vinyls from NFS Heat, it's good 

With my meagre 3 hours playing this game so far I think I'd rate it 5 / 10... Would be much higher without the visual vomit that screws with my autistic brain. I no likey visual vomit.... Too distracting.",1690350855,1690350855,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I do like it, the art style is really fun and a cool take on the game but there are a lot of problems like the other reviews say. The cop chases are the absolute worst and you face them nearly every time you complete a race, even on dedicated race tracks in stadiums and stuff which is stupid. The restart limitations are awful. The heat buildup is just too fast for the amount of rewards you get early game and the cops are relentless with their awful reinforcement system that just spawns more cops right in front of you out of nowhere. Also because of the god awful rewards you don't spend much time being able to really customize your car outside of performance which is just sad.

I have been enjoying it though after installing a few mods and it's honestly how I'd suggest playing it:
1. Download the NFS Unbound Remix mod, it adds new tracks, changes handling a little bit, gives you 150 restarts, and adds fast travel so you can just teleport to events instead of having to slowly crawl your way to events dodging cops. There is one issue to this though, remix does make cops a bit more difficult but trust me there is a way around that.
2. Install the money multiplier mod to give events in story mode 2x the cash payout. Trust me it's worth it. You can have more freedom with your cars customize them until your heart's content and genuinely have more fun with the game.
3. When playing if you really... really don't want to deal with the cops when free roaming leave game and return to the game, Cop problem solved. Yeah it sucks having to do it this way but it's better than being in an endless 5 star cop chase that just won't end.

- there is no quick travel to places in the map forcing you into pursuits
- the heat only goes from day to day, so if you are at day and go to the garage, your heat level wont get down at night, and changing your car or the style of your car does not help at all.

Most of my play time came in the first few months and I have just tried this again to see nothing has improved. Some of my biggest issues are below:

Handling: The handling in this game is one of the worst in the franchise. The fluid drifting seen in previous titles feels clunky in the examples I've had, with drifts braking randomly and pulling my car away from the natural path (especially if using handbrake mid-drift). Having a grip option is nice, but it is a shame that it doesn't do much; I still find cars (usually S and above) initialising drifts when I have turned gas and brake entry off.

Cops: Everyone loves a good cop chase, but this is 90% of the gameplay and is extremely repetitive. They also do not feel satisfying as your car will be thrown around whilst cops and other racers feel like rocks embedded into the ground.

Gameplay Loop: Following on from cop chases, I find the way you progress through this game to be horrendous. The game will give you 7 days before each major story chapter, which does not sound too bad, but when split into 14 opportunities to leave the garage (day & night) it makes the story feel drawn out just to last longer. Added with the endless cop chases, it makes the game extremely boring and frustrating to play when being punished for bad handling.

Story/Characters: For the first time in NFS, I have not finished the story (due to the gameplay) so it is difficult for me to comment. It is very basic in nature, but doesn't make it bad necessarily. Lots of the dialogue is very ""cringe."" The main characters are okay, but are not memorable at all.

Overall, if you are looking for a modern NFS with less issues, get NFS Heat. I seriously regret buying this game..",1690320734,1690320734,False,3,0,0.542090654373168945,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment as I delved into this latest installment.

To begin with, the game's storyline felt lackluster and poorly executed. The attempt to blend a crime drama narrative with street racing elements fell flat, leaving me unengaged and disconnected from the characters and their motivations. The story progression lacked depth, making it difficult to invest in the events unfolding throughout the game.

Moreover, the open-world environment that has been a staple of the Need for Speed franchise felt underwhelming in Unbound. The city lacked the vibrant atmosphere and immersive feel of previous titles, resulting in a mundane and uninspired driving experience. Exploring the city felt more like a chore rather than an exciting adventure, and the lack of interactive elements in the environment further added to the monotony.

The most significant letdown was the driving mechanics, which seemed unrefined and clunky. The handling of the cars felt imprecise, making even the simplest of maneuvers frustratingly difficult. This lack of control detracted from the core racing experience, leaving me feeling more frustrated than thrilled during races.

The game's progression system also left much to be desired. The grind to unlock new cars and upgrade them felt unnecessarily tedious, with little sense of accomplishment upon achieving these milestones. The in-game currency was scarce, pushing players towards microtransactions, which, in my opinion, detracts from the enjoyment of the game.

Need for Speed™ Unbound also suffered from technical issues and glitches. From frame rate drops during intense races to occasional crashes, these problems disrupted the flow of the game and made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the gameplay.

Additionally, the online multiplayer aspect of Unbound was underwhelming. Limited options for cooperative or competitive play left me wanting more interaction with other players, and the lack of meaningful rewards for participating in online races further diminished the appeal of this feature.

In conclusion, Need for Speed™ Unbound fell short of living up to the high standards set by its predecessors. The uninspired storyline, lackluster open-world environment, subpar driving mechanics, and technical issues significantly marred the overall experience. While it may have some redeeming qualities, the game failed to capture the essence of what makes the Need for Speed series so enjoyable. I cannot recommend Unbound to longtime fans of the franchise, as it simply does not deliver on the excitement and thrill that players have come to expect.",1690253591,1690253591,False,1,0,0.502142012119293213,0,True,False,False

Beyond that, the gameplay is absolutely ridiculous. I'm playing on ""normal"" and I can't WIN races. I've got hundreds of hours in driving games, how is that even possible? Why can I not come first? I was doing a marathon race and I was ahead by minimum 400 yards, in the last 10% of the race (I'm still going 130) I get passed by someone?? Excuse me? That's a joke. Rubber banding, tethering, whatever it is, it's bad and overtuned.
Cops. Oh boy the cops. There are 3 cops on my radar at all times. My states biggest city doesn't have that officer presence. The good part is that escaping at heat 2 is fine. Anything above that, you'll be driving around for an hour just to try and get back to a garage. A simple fix would be to allow safehouses to be an instant escape. I've played this game three hours, and I see all these massive problems. How is this allowed? And I havent even mentioned how hard it is to buy a new car.
For the love of God, just buy a Forza Horizon game.

Having just completed the story mode, I can say that this is the best Need for Speed title I've played since Carbon in 2006. I've played almost all of them since then, as I'm a huge fan of the series. I think they've accomplished exactly what they set out to do in the creation of this game. It isn't realistic. It isn't gritty, or dark. It's fun. It has personality. It's a full arcade racer that actually has some soul to it. It has a unique art-style and atmosphere, in a pretty well designed world.

The racing physics are quite nice, especially compared to previous titles, i.e. Heat and 2015. Grip/Drift tuning has returned, you can actually choose which drifting style to use (brake-to-drift, gas-to-drift, turn off arcade drifting styles entirely in favor of grip turning), and cars actually all have unique weight models - a feature actually missing in NFS: Heat.

The world design is much better than Heat. Lakeshore is a very well crafted city. Gone are the 6-lane highways between the occasional high-rise, in favor of actual tight city streets. There's more than one dedicated ""mountain"" zone, which allows for some actual decent touge racing, with plenty of winding roads, perfect for tight drift chaining. There's lots of stretches of straight-shot freeways, allowing you to go flat-out and test the top speeds of your cars. I'd say the one thing the world lacks is meaningful off-roading areas. Sure, there's plenty of dirt fields and such, but there's not much in the way of legitimate off-road racing areas (or off-road races, for that matter).

The story is cheesy, as usual. There's a weird, political B-plot in the story that takes place in the background that tries to justify the characters being street racers, but it just comes off preachy and hypocritical. That said, it's better than usual, but don't expect a narrative anything like NFS: The Run. The dialogue will be very dated, given a few years, but there are some moments that did warrant a chuckle now and again.

The game isn't without issues, though. My main gripe is that you have no idea which cars are viable, as the rating system is mostly useless, and serves more than anything, to group the cars into general ""classes"" than actually being reliable gauges on how a car will perform. Sure, an A+ class car will outperform a B class car, but will my 400+ (max-S+ class) car outperform this 381 (mid-S+ class) opponent vehicle? Won't know until you blow your oh-so-valuable (and scarce, in the early game) cash on it. You just don't get much leeway to experiment, which I've always found to be one of my favorite parts of the more modern NFS games. You gotta find what works, and you gotta find it quick, because if it doesn't, you aren't gonna be winning races. The difficulty will also be pretty divisive to most players. Some, like myself, like some of the restraints that have been put in place, like mandatory heat buildup after races, which really adds to the risk/reward factor, and limited daily retries, to prevent you from resetting until you get a perfect run. Others will find this frustrating (especially if you end up getting and investing into one of those non-viable cars I was talking about earlier), which is completely understandable. It's very unforgiving, and a lot of players will find themselves restarting if they didn't make the right gambles on their cars.

Multiplayer is super barebones at the moment. I don't plan to touch it until most of the feature-set they've promised has been added, like pink-slips, online cop chases, and position betting. Here's hoping post-launch support doesn't end up instantly dying like Heat, they've got something super special here.

*UPDATED MULTIPLAYER REVIEW*
After having logged a good 60ish hours into multiplayer with some friends now, I can say that playing this game with a group of buddies is a great time. There's a lot of fun playlists, the cops aren't too intrusive, you earn money at a good rate, and the speed pass is free and just gives you extra stuff to look forward to as you play. Linkups are a good way to take a break from the normal races and wreck some stuff, mess with cops, and do some jumps and you get a pretty nice payday at the end if you manage to complete all of the objectives. Still no pinkslip races as of this update (VOL. 3 UPDATE), but me and my friends are still managing to have a good time.

In the 1st and 2nd week the game is really hard and not because you're a bad driver, it's because you're in a B or A class car trying to get some cash during the day so that's all fun and games but when night comes and you have a lvl 5 heat on you that's when things get really annoying because you're trying to get to a race but you spend half of the playing time avoiding the cops. 

If you get spotted then it takes a long time to lose them especially in those lower tier cars, that's if you survive that long because why would a Raptor police car not be able to keep up with the Aventador at 300+ km/h, and just most of the cops(heat 3+) have waaaaaay too much handling and speed. And another annoying thing is that if you set a way point and get spotted the game just spawns cops on that same road...like mind reading or something.

About the AI racers, i mean it's okish but either they are bad or really good(or at least better cars) like freaking Lyric with his 600LT in the S tier races(how is that fair?) and the bad are the ones the game gives you in the HeadtoHead races..by the time you finish the race they are 500+m behind you.

Most of the races are good, but i had trouble winning in the drifting events, EA could have given the same rewards for drifting(cars and money) to the sprinting races or any of the other ones.

And it's hard to try all the cars, or at least the really expensive ones, and even the less expensive ones because you would still have to upgrade them to w.e tier you want, so i won't grind in NFS:))

There were some bugs, like while driving randomly to a race cars would just be flipped in front of you for no reason, hitting a bump on the road would just keep the car(Aventador) bumping way too much.. it's not a lowrider EA, after i finished the game i bought the LaFerrari, got in a cop chase and before losing them i got in an accident and when i got reset the car was invisible.

Other than that, the music was meh, the dialog between the characters was...well better should have left me hearing the engine roar, driving effects are kind of getting in the way sometimes(blocking the view), btw you can't turn them off but there are some that aren't so in your face.

BTW i played on intense and apparently it took me 65 hours to finish the game without doing all the drifting/speed traps and all the other bs to 100%...and i won't because they're boring, i'm recommending it but only if you really want to play it after all that=)",1687986490,1690222964,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

honestly the game feels new and refreshing unlike of what others are saying it can be pretty challenging to win races and managed not getting chase by cops but what suprised me of the game is it reminds me of Driver series in some kinda way . 

next car handling is what you xpect of a next gen racing game it feel perfectly fine once you master a car . 

grapics on maxed setting is beautiful but i am more into the gameplay aspect of unbound and it has its flaws where there are some things i dont like such as the A.i n races but it still feels like a need for speed title to play and enjoy . the cops arent a big problem from what i  experience if you know ur way around the map  u can lose them easily . 

music selections isnt a big problem as i likes hiphop and am glad they added varity of other music onto the game . so all in all the game has been fun . 

i won my first car from an event and from then on i been enjoying the game . 

 if theres a few things that i like apon playing it for the first time was the characters intereaction with the drivers and mc it really set the vibes an toned of the game just as previous racing games like midnight club LA and Midnight club 2 and 3 has done .

The story took me 25 hours to complete and i actually had fun while grinding the races.

Trust me the feeling of finishing the story and then upgrading your supercar to max speed and racing with it is just insane (the lamborghini murcielago wich you get from story was my go to ^^) !!
 
Sometimes the cops are just completely unnecessary but not that big of a deal since you can outdrive them in terms of speed.

Now comes the annoying part, the game have difficulty levels where you can choose, each difficulties have their own pre-determined number of retries for races which is ridiculous, why should there be a limit to the number of retries? we should be allowed to retry the races as much as we want, we paid for the game. Another annoying part is the opponents in races, if we get left behind even just a little bit, it's almost impossible to beat the 1st or 2nd spot, no matter how fast we were going we will never be able to catch up. Earning money is ridiculously hard in this game, each races earns you like 1k-6k but with your slow ass beginner cars it's almost impossible to beat the other racers so sometimes you might even lose money since most races requires a buy in. the performance parts are even more expensive than the cars you bought.

Race maps are very enjoyable in every class with different racing styles (Grip or Drift), making it even more competitive to learn the different speeds while racing to be at the top.

Why is that? 

The story is predictable at best (but that is nothing new), but I'd say it is above average for the NFS franchise.

The art-style is nice, but it's weird that everything is realistic except for the characters. Just... why?

The driving is feels solid (still arcadey, but that's good), but man the Takeover and Drift missions just suck and feel out of place. (They are also not integrated in the main ""campaign"" and just... exist).

I played on the hardest difficulty and it was still not a challenge, the rubber-banding sometimes was atrocious and it still wasn't much of a challenge.

Being able to tune the cars was nice, but is pretty much just: ""bigger number better car"", if you have a car that is top of it's class you've practically one while playing blind (and it's not hard to achieve that kind of level). Modding the visuals is nice, but some car manufacturers simply don't let you do that.

The police is not difficult, it's *just* annoying, I recommend for you to just get the auxiliary mods to get out of chases faster and be more difficult to spot. It makes your life so much easier.

Liked the effects (finally some style!!! :), car physics is nice, storyline is fine. Gameplay is also fun, even though repetitive a bit. Loved drifting and takeover races :)
But money grinding is horrible - if you bought a car and bond like it - you still must upgrade and use it or otherwise you won't be able to race properly. I got 1,7 million via cheat engine in singleplayer just to not think about this stuff... And THEN game starts to be fun :)

For cop chases - you can easily beat the most primitive cops head on or in back at a full speed! Just slam them! If you can't, just drive offroad/sideways. Wanna take them down easily? Install reinforcement part - this will help :)
At start I was angry about them ust like anyone else, but once you understand how they car physics and how the cops work - you can mostly just ignore them or get away from them in like 2-5 minutes. Yeah, even from heat 5, trust me. Also, don't forget to upgrade your car :)

I made an even bigger mistake thinking if I stuck it out for a few hours I'd start to learn, but no, I'm stuck without a refund and furious EA ruined what could have been a cool, very different feeling NFS in a long series of fun games by making it so impossible that I leave the game feeling infuriated with my heart racing, my muscles twitching, cursing so loud my neighbors are probably wondering if I'm committing domestic violence against my computer.

I started playing NFS back when the original Hot Pursuit came out. Like that, NFS Unbound is very cop heavy, which can be fun. However, there's no option to turn cops off. There's no races without cops or traffic, which basically means the entire game is dodging cars through challenging urban streets. No down time. No relaxation stretches like other NFS games. Forget epilepsy warnings. Wanna-be drivers will need a cardiologist after playing this for a week.

Urban streets, while probably the most challenging NFS course I've ever driven, would be fun. Except like others mentioned, if you make one mistake, even in easy mode, you fly into a wall, get smashed by invincible cops or competitors, or T-bone a delivery truck that for some reason decided to enter an intersection with eight racers separated by mere yards going by at 100+ mph.

As if all that weren't ridiculous enough, let's talk about the nonexistent reward system that is supposed to keep me addicted. 16+ hours of this game later, due to game mechanics and Hollywood-perfect AI drivers, it's impossible to rack up enough cash to upgrade my ride to be competitive. And even when I upgrade, the AI cars in each tier are just as good, making upgrading my ride absolutely pointless. If I can't beat the inhumanly perfect AI drivers with driving alone, I should be able to shave a few tenths of my lap times off with a better car than my competitors.

Drifting: Super fun in NFS Payback. Clunky, impossible game mechanics here. Drifting courses wind less than street race courses, and if you're driving an A-tier car (if you stick this awful game out long enough to get there), there's only two turns you even need to drift on because even after tweaking my car for drifting, it still grips too well to get enough speed to bother drifting.

Takedown: What in the name of Carol Shelby is this garbage? The obstacle course thing from NFS Payback was annoying enough because you couldn't progress through the storyline without driving a pimped-up Mini Cooper through a traffic barrier. But at least it was occasionally fun. This garbage has the same issue as drifting races: I can't gain enough speed between obstacles to collect enough drifting points to win because my car grips too well when it shouldn't and not at all when it should.

Clearly, EA is having to sell this a game at a loss. I bought this on the July discount, and it still wasn't worth my $20.",1690039564,1690039564,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Story[/h1]
The premise isn't bad. Stolen car, rivalry, betrayal... could have been interesting, but the execution misses.

First off the car that got [spoiler]stolen[/spoiler] isn't even that good compared to another one that's worth [i]over a million[/i]. Where the heck did Rydell get all that money?!

Second the prologue drags on for far too long so you don't get to buy any cars or upgrades until 5 hours in.

Third it tries to do too many things at once. Politics, side characters telling you their life stories while you play Uber driver, A$AP Rocky's cameos and the main plot. There's a lot of potentially meaningful ideas to explore but most of them are just one-off line deliveries.

[b]Score: 5/10[/b]

[h1]Presentation (Graphics, Sound, UI)[/h1]
The panoramas are beautiful. The cel-shaded style works for me, it gives the game its own character. The city feels like the kind of place where illicit car meetups happen. Visually it's done well.

Car sounds are on-point for an arcade racer, from buzzy small engines to rumbly big ones to revvy supercar ones. Gear switching and superchargers sound deep and impactful. It's not realistic at all, it's dramatic but it works.

Music... they were going for a specific feel but when I'm in the garage I want something chill and ambient, not vocal rap! Same when out cruising vs racing. I get what they're going for but it doesn't match what I'm doing ingame so I had to turn it off.

UI is somehow [i]worse[/i] than Heat. There's even less information being presented, which is frankly unacceptable considering how stingy the game is with money. First off the important numbers like 1-60, HP, Torque, max speed etc aren't on one screen anymore, you need to press a button to tab between two pages of stats. Second the stated max Horsepower on an engine is a lie, that's only the max with its stock supercharger or lack of thereof. I still have no idea whether a car is heavy or not. Possibly the worst thing is buying engines is a complete black box. I have no idea why a 2.8L V6 is capable of 900HP but a 6.2L V8 tops out at 800ish, and unlike Heat if you buy a bad engine you can't even sell it or equip it on a different car.

[b]Score: 6.5/10[/b]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You earn literally nothing in the prologue except maybe budget for clothes. After that, you earn bank at a decent pace... [i]if[/i] you buy exactly the right cars and upgrades for each rank.

For example, buying gearbox upgrades at lower ranks is a newbie trap. It bumps your theoretical max speed but since early game races have a ton of corners that's practically useless. And you can't sell it. Go farm 3 races to recoup the cost of that gearbox!

Some cars have stock V8 engines that look good going by the name, but as it turns out you're supposed to buy a lower ranked V6 with half the fuel capacity and a lower stated max HP, then upgrade that to make it viable in S+. Not to mention engines for some reason cost more than entire cars despite not being able to swap them to another car. So I thought a terrible V8 was the best it could get and sold the car the first time round!

Also the game still doesn't have a cornering score so it's impossible to tell how good or bad a build is at cornering besides crashing it a lot in races. As it turns out, for most cars at S+ you need open the Tuning menu and max Downforce and Grip to avoid spinning out for free when doing a 5 degree turn, which is a huge change from previous games.

The AI does cheat but if you build in a specific way (i.e. upgrade Gearbox only as a last resort at lower ranks, magically predict which engine is viable and tune for full grip in S+) it's quite winnable.

If you can wade through the long prologue, stingy early game payouts, cryptic stats and myriad newbie traps, there's actually a fun racing game with nice car customization at the end. Older cars have new parts, and different cars have different strengths. But the game seems to try its hardest to prevent you from getting to that point.

Also, as other players mentioned, there's not a lot of content. Even during the story you repeat the same few races over and over.

[b]Score: 6.5/10[/b]

Pros.
The police is substantially less annoying than it was in NFS Heat, very easy to escape them.
Selection of cars and modification options is great, like base NFS Heat with new cars, new parts and better models and designs.

Handling model is arcade-y and float-y with a pretty big emphasis on drifting a-la Mario Kart, but traditional full grip, line-based racing is rewarded, unlike in NFS Heat.

Cartoon aspect of the game is minimal, and it adds a little unique flair when preforming certain actions such as getting boost, doing burnouts and preforming stunt jumps.

No differentiation between daytime races awarding cash and nighttime races awarding EXP for leveling, you just unlock more cars and more modifications as you progress and start to get higher tier races. Very good and welcome change

Not pros, not cons.

Dialogue in this game is very zoomer, but this is a NFS game, dialogue and story was never good or interesting. 

LGBT billboards in the game, always very nice to see but if you can't bear to see or acknowledge people who aren't straight or cisgender, they're very unintrusive and mostly around the main city.

Cons.
No fast travel, lots of driving around from race to race, especially annoying when there is more than one race you want to do at a meet-up spot.

Crashing slightly throws you into a full crash animation EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. This is the most annoying part of the game.

Money is slow to get and harder to come by than in NFSH.

Tl;dr dont listen to most of the negative reviews for this game, get it for yourself on sale, play it, race, go fast, modify, paint, enjoy. this game is great fun and very nicely stylised.",1689900663,1689900663,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

So here is a list of all the bullshittery this game has to offer:

CONS:

-A$AP Rocky can't form sentences without saying ""and"" or ""but"" every 2 seconds
-Bullshit handling, cars don't drift or turn properly it's inconsistent so you wonder why the fuck the car didnt turn
-Bullshit AI
-Bullshit races, they randomly throw you in an off-road track which severely hinders your car performance unless you went for an off-road build
-Shit ton of cars clashing with each other you can't even drift properly cuz 10 cars are trying to go through the same narrow road
-Bullshit parked cars and traffic, they increased the amount of traffic cars so you end up crashing all the time and he AI is braindead so they just drive as if there aren't cars passing them at lightspeed
-Shit cops, you get rewarded with a measly 2.5k$ after evading Heat 5 cops which are beyond annoying also ULTIMATE parts don't exist in this game unlike NFS Heat and REP lvl doesn't exist either so cops are beyond pointless they are just annoying
-Whoever thought takeover races were a good idea should be fired, even if you don't drop the combo throughout the entire race you lose cuz bullshit AI bullshit difficulty
-Difficulty is so bs, play dark souls or sekiro instead this shit isn't even funny cars are always faster than you even though they are rated so much below you. They make no mistakes unless they get rng'd into crashing
-Buy-ins fuck up your economy and you basically end up losing money due to bullshit AI and difficulty
-RnG festival, random ass traffic car decided to spawn in your racing line? too bad. Cops decided to jump off a cliff just to hit you and fuck up your 1st place? too bad.
-This game is the embodiment of frustration. Handling is a step backwards. Fix this game honestly.
-BMW M3 GTR is put behind a paywall, so even if you spend 9 times the money of EA Play by buying the game, you can't get it. I had the luck of discovering mods that unlock the GTR, However sadly it handles like absolute horseshit, and it doesn't even reach a performance rating of 400+. The car just doesn't turn, and when it does, over steers and it's almost impossible to regain control of the drift.
-DO NOT BUY THIS ABSOLUTE SHIT EXCUSE OF A NFS GAME. PLAY HEAT INSTEAD lol.

Single player and story wise it's a mediocre game, might be the ""meh"" reviews out there and i agree.

Multiplayer has a unique formula that all successful games has -> easy to learn, hard to master, i will explain:

The nitrous mechanic it's the best mechanic I've ever seen on any arcade game, it's crucial to master it in order to have the edge on the competition, this comes along with the handling system that is either grip, drift or both.

The tuning system despite it's an old formula, it's great, in order to hit the perfect formula, the devs should only balance all the cars because since this is just a casual game, there is cars that are broken on certain classes and in the end, to win on this game you end up with only one car most of the times on each class or else when in a similar skill gap, there is no other vehicle alternatives to fit individual driving styles.

I really don't know why this game didn't got the attention it needed, maybe because the art style disappointed certain players that didn't even touch the game due to that (and because it didn't landed on previous console generations), but believe me, this art style fits perfectly on the mechanics of the game to give the player feedback of what is happening with the car.

I would hope that EA worked on a single title based on this gameplay concept and invested on competitive play, I loved it and I would enjoy that the player-base would be bigger, this reminds me a lot of burnout with car customization, new grip/drift handling and nitrous system, it's wonderfully innovative and hitted the spot.",1689886775,1689886775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Somewhat large variety of cars
-Money gain becomes a lot easier by the time you reach the S rank
-Car spawned on a van and launched into the air, then respawned way in the sky unable to move(it was glorious)

Cons:
-Lack of varied races, you repeat the same ones over and over.
-No fast travel, and have to enter an event or go to safehouse to change a car
-Changing a car does not reduce your heat level, which makes no sense to me
-Some racers, especially in S/S+ are pretty overpowered if your car isn't that quick
-Cops after almost every race(although the underground pipe place gets rid of em quick)

pros 
 stylish
customization is their best feature
racing feels more balanced with more bumper to bumper racing  thanks to the class system.

neutrals
very funky but sometimes rewarding driving physics
class system is good 
upgrade system got a little better too since every part provides different benefits unlike before.
city and map is decent 

cons
 helicopters sometimes see you through tunnels
police rubberbanding on chases looks very forced
chases are boring and is padding for time 
heat being the same for all cars owned making b class events tedious
the story mode is so long but nothing is happening is just you racing every day and night
same ai racers throught the game
no ai racers freeroaming 
police sometimes smash your car with the force or sometimes bumping at low speed will smash your car instantly
asaps rockys takeover never changes 
city has alot of dead ends theres barely any hidden alleyways so basically if the road doesnt exist on the map its a dead end.


verdict 

6.6/10

even on sale is questionable if its worth it,it funs as you start and it gets tedious after a couple hours.feels like im playing quick play instead of a story.is a good foundation for a great need for speed but with the lack of updates (AGAIN) lack of support, is just  another game being pumped out to print money i do see the passion in the game but barely.
 

edit

played online and is fun but 
very barebones and lacking content ,why cant be bet against other players why cant race for pinkslips,can we have cops in races online  or at least send a race invite to everyone playing online not just the lobby i have never raced with more than 6 people and is always 3 or just me and someone else racing.its fun to play but very lacking on features",1685821049,1689624206,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While it may offer a visually appealing experience and a vast open-world setting, several key aspects of the game contribute to its overall negative reception.

Firstly, one of the most glaring issues with Need for Speed Unbound is its lackluster gameplay mechanics. The controls feel unresponsive and imprecise, leading to frustrating moments during races and an overall lack of enjoyment. The driving physics, a crucial element in any racing game, feel unrealistic and disconnected from reality, detracting from the immersive experience that players seek. Additionally, the AI opponents often exhibit inconsistent behavior, alternating between being overly aggressive or unrealistically passive, further diminishing the game's sense of challenge and excitement.
Adding on to the unrealistic driving game play I've been busted in the NFS Unbound for hitting the smallest curves and edges.

Secondly, the game's narrative and progression system leave much to be desired. Need for Speed Unbound fails to deliver a compelling storyline, leaving players disengaged and uninterested in the outcome. The characters lack depth and development, making it difficult for players to form any emotional connection or investment. Furthermore, the progression system feels disjointed and unrewarding, with little sense of accomplishment or meaningful progression as players advance through the game. This lack of a compelling narrative and progression undermines the game's longevity and replayability, ultimately rendering it a forgettable experience.

In conclusion, Need for Speed Unbound falls short in several key areas, making it a disappointing addition to the franchise. The subpar gameplay mechanics and unresponsive controls hinder the overall enjoyment, while the lack of a compelling narrative and progression system fails to engage players on a deeper level. While it may have its visual merits and an expansive open-world setting, these aspects alone cannot compensate for the game's numerous flaws. Need for Speed Unbound ultimately lacks the substance and polish that would make it a worthwhile and memorable racing game experience.",1689573215,1689573215,True,8,0,0.556132733821868896,4,True,False,False

At least up until where I am, which is week 2 day 1.
The first couple of days I could not win at all, the rest of the week I was winning, but only thanks to the drafting mechanic and my awesome driving (and ramming) skills
but now im back to losing. Going 200 mph in a crown vic, and im still slower than the competition.
 
I thought people were exaggerating about the cops... they were not. they chase you like 19/7 dude.
Theres also that corvette cop that is literally designed to be faster than you no matter what you are driving
There are side missions where you drive a random car and escape heat, I got the luxury of driving the fastest car in the game and that corvette cop was still much faster than me. 

The game is fun, well optimized, and has a cool style. But the difficulty is crazy, and the cops are so annoying on tier 3+...
Honestly wish the cars had more visual customization too, each car only has a handful of options, but they are all drastic changes. 
The wrap creation system is honestly lack luster and donkey
Also not a fan of hype beasts, all of the characters talk like them.

I understand it does get a fair amount of hate, I think it's due to mainly the long-ish prologue.

Also the game is quite realistic to a sense, you can't use an infinite amount of retries and there is no ""Forza Rewind"".
If you mess up and crash, it is likely you have to perfect the rest of the race or write it off completely, again realistic.

It has a high risk, high reward system and I absolutely love this as it gives me something to actually care about.
I bought it on sale for around $30 with the palace edition included and I do not regret the buy at all.

Graphics are actually decent, you can minimize the arcade style smoke and puff if you don't like that, but I kinda liked the art style. 6/10 for this.

Driving feels extreme levels of janky due some arcade mechanics like sometimes boost make drift, more drift, sometimes boost makes your car grip to floor with super glue, and that drift you were making suddenly stops, shoots you straight to where you are facing at. Gameplay is about 7/10

I paid 22euros from sale this. Still kinda felt I paid too much sadly. for 10euro game its okayish, for full price hell no.

Pros
- Handling is very versatile, Can opt for Grip and Drift handling both or a mix of it, it incentivizes experimentation with handling setup.
- Sense of speed is nice, although u feel that sense in higher end cars and not in the early stages of career.
- Tag system i.e various effects after using burst nitrous, drifting and jumping. It makes it stand out of other racing games, gives it some vibe and personality. Although it might depend from person to person if he likes these effects or not. Personally its a nice touch and a breath of fresh air although it could've expanded even more.
- Game looks nice in both daytime and night, City looks nice, although off-skirts environments looks a bit bland.
- Burst nitrous mechanic adds a bit of nuance to driving in the game. It rewards drifting, drafting, near misses with cars, taking down cops, jumping, grip turns, and other aggressive manuevers. (Upgrade and callback to the nitrous system in NFS Underground series) It gives decent speed boost and helps in end drifts by shifting the cars momentum.
- Plenty of cars with variety of customization although most of the car list is same as NFS Heat with few additions.
- Car upgrade system is good just like heat.

Cons

 
- Drifting feels weird, like very jittery and causes a lot of speed loss. And considering how often one can drift and NFS has huge fan-base for drifting. Its one of the biggest drawbacks in NFS Unbound's handling.
- Career Progression feels boring and repetitive with its weekly system.
- Day and Night cycle doesn't have much difference, where NFS Heat was so much better with its Day and Night cycle complementing the risk and reward factor which became a serious downgrade in Unbound.
- Open world in Unbound is kinda bland only the main city looks it has some vibe but not a lot.
- Soundtrack is the worst till date in the whole franchise. The soundtrack mostly consist of hip-hop and rap with some techno music. Earlier titles had songs from all genres. But most songs are mediocre some songs being downright cringe. The techno music is good tho. Although music can be subjective but most of the songs are from different countries in different languages and it feels like the game is trying to appeal to wide variety of people but ending up appealing to nobody. Also huge missed opportunity for not including Tyga the creator.
- ASAP Rocky doesn't have much presence beside for a driving job and in takeover events.
- The story in Career mode is downright bad and cringe and had the worst throwback to NFS Most wanted 2005. The writing and voicing is also awful. 
- Not much variety in event types in Career mode. Mostly Circuits, Sprints, Drift modes, Takeover is also pretty meh.
Delivery jobs and Drop-offs events are fine but not great.
- Career and Multiplayer have separate progression. So many people will have to grind again for cars, upgrades and what-not.
- In MP, each server can old upto 16 players only making match-making and finding races kinda annoying.
- Cops are annoying, One can reach heat lvl 5 really quickly after 2-3 races (and heat doesn't reset after daytime going back to garage) and losing them in early stages of career is a pain in the ass. 

-Specific to Vol.3
- Speedpass and Linkups are uninspiring and makes the game look like its going for player retention rather than player enjoyment.
- Had some bugs in meetups and had a visual bugs using DLSS with my 3060 laptop. So had to resort using FSR even tho i have 30 series gpu which kinda sucks.

-Conclusion
Although NFS Unbound is a decent racing game with good racing with some style, it has way many drawbacks and an overall downgrade from the previous NFS Heat. Buy the game on sale not on full price.

7/10

Thats what your buying...a drawn over cartoon version of Heat with the Studio Android App in-game and a bunch of useless effects, avatars, and stickers that you need to earn or pay for.

Its also much more demanding compared to any other NFS thats ever existed...all for them to slap silly effects on top of the old car models if I had to guess. I own almost all of the NFS games and I couldn't justify the sale cost for this game.

I've become somewhat of a racing fanatic and own most racing games you can buy, but here's the real laugh about this story--it was all because of Hot Pursuit Remastered.

I would pay $80 for another 25 sets of courses on that game in a heartbeat, but I refunded this game with a bad taste in my mouth as soon as I left the garage and realized the handling was practically identical, maybe a bit off as far as drifting (in a bad way) and once again was forced to accept the sad reality (gods why?!?) that open world map style racing games seem to be the new genre destroying trend among children and the rest of the sadly devolving population.

If you want to play GTA V, stay in your server and if you want to make a racing game stay on the tracks.

I decided on buying the classic Dirt game and original Hot Pursuit for XP / Vista to run on my Windows 10 each for about the same cost I paid for this before refunding it and I have no doubt I'll enjoy them much more.

EA - Loose the map          👎
Codemaster - Come back 🙏
Colin - See you soon    💪

I will always be a Need For Speed fan and I plan to hunt down the delisted ones I missed with the hopes I can fill the void that Hot Pursuit left in my list of games I want to load everytime I open Steam or EA. Hopefully one day I will find a game that can, because no game from any developer or any franchise has ever came close. I own a massive selection of all types of racing games and I still find myself loading up Hot Pursuit and I generally never replay games or launch them after I consider them completed.

I'm completely against having multiple modes or settings that can break games (look at Ac), but maybe they should add a mode without the map for players who just want to race because just like that franchise you had it absolutely perfect and you destroyed it trying to mesh with other game idea from ones that you considered competition, and just like that franchise you will either return to what made your games great...or you will fade out of the light from the high beams and into the rear view mirror to be left in the dust of what could have been the best lap in history.

I'll be waiting at the finish line if you ever cross it my old friend.

Until then, I wish you good nitro and sweet victories...I'll just be over here cleaning up the vomit on the floor next to my computer and the leftover assets from the previous game.",1689307958,1689307958,False,0,0,0.448288679122924805,0,True,False,False

All of that being said, when you’re doing the events the actual racing and driving is fun once you get used to how drifting works. I also like the art style but acknowledge it isn’t for everyone, same for the soundtrack. For the next NFS, ea should make cops an optional choice that can be turned on/off in the difficulty menu.
Overall, don’t buy at full price, consider using single player mods to balance the game better, the cops completely suck, and the core driving game play is fun.

I love this game from a technicality perspective and the racing mechanics themselves, the races are fun and the takeover events give further gameplay variety. The customisation is amazing, a large pool of cars to pick from where you can equip body kit presets or modify the single parts to your liking. But the game is not without it's drawbacks, of which some of them feel detrimental 
-The soundtrack has very little variation to it each track feels like it's within the same genre or similar, with the only differentiating factor being the languages of the songs and in general the tracks don't feel like they are suited to the feel of arcade racing 
-The cop mechanics are poorly thought out, gaining heat quickly is very easy towards the end of the game but keep in mind the heat stays the same regardless of the tier of car your driving and it only resets when the day starts. The lower heat levels are easy to evade by simply outpacing the cops. In the higher heat levels cops have much more of an arsenal to throw out at you, but they're driving is erratic, they'll either keep to the speed your going at and keep a buffer distance between you and them so you can't hit them, or they're overly and unnecessarily aggressive this isn't so bad but does feel really frustrating when the ford raptor police car does extreme damage to you making a gas station stop necessary . The biggest issue with the cops is how they just swarm the city at night sometimes I feel like I'm spending more time evading cops than attending races, going offroad and periodically turning my engine off to avoid helicopters to get to races simply is not fun at all 
-Anti aliasing options, I don't know whether this is an inherent limitation of the frostbite engine but there need to be more options than FXAA or TAA, if I wanted a blurry filter as my AA choice I'd rather just enable and upscaler like FSR 2 in this instance and get more performance",1685040750,1689220747,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The police ruin this game unfortunately, unbelievably frustrating; you spend an hour doing races only to lose all the progress you made because the police kept spawning helicopters and cars in the most ridiculous fashion ever. Apparently repair kits don't actually do anything as well so don't bother equipping them.

- The soundtrack sucks but you can mute it.
- The handling characteristics are all over the place.
- You never know what barrier, plant, sign is something your car will crash when hitting or something you'll lose no speed when ploughing straight through, which makes it very annoying when you think you can go through this pillar because you did go through one similar 2 corners ago but find yourself crashing.
- There is very little variety of the AI racers, Justicia appears in B, A and A+ races with the same car with different performance number, which just seems lazy and gets very repetitive 
- The separation of the Story and Online modes just seems pointless?
- There are limited restarts per day for some reason, this is particularly frustrating when the police seemingly go from 50-150mph in a second and catch up to you and targeting the player not the other CPU racers youre against.
- The online cars have a very good selection but some are locked behind a grind of 90+ races?? Why? Who wants to complete 90 B class races in a Chevrolet to be able to buy a Chevy pickup from the 60s?
- The story and the characters are all very shallow and make the story uninteresting.

Some positives are the game looks good and runs well, apart from an occasional crash. There are a lot of cars to choose from and the visual customisation is actually fantastic, you can make you car look exactly how you'd like. The cartoon/real art-style is a nice change and fits quite nicely into the game.

The handling of most cars is crisp and feels good.
There are a ton of different cars.
The story is alright and not cringe (huge improvement from previous titles *cough* NFS 2015 *cough*
The races are alright to good and there is enough variety.
Even the ""diversity"" of characters is subtle and not forced. It actually creates a good cast of characters with a little bit of a backround that you can ignore if you want. You can tell that gameplay and story came first and that is how it should be. 

But all this gets overshadowed by the fucking cops.

Jeeeeeesus Christ the constant cop chases get old reaaaally fast, especially because there is nothing to make it more interesting. Take the original Most Wanted as an example: you also had a lot of cop chases but at least you got milestones to reach. You were also able to use your environment to destroy cop cars and get away. Also your car hat infinite HP.
But in unbound you just drive away and try not to hit anything. No type of cop is particularly challenging to deal with except the special offroad cops. Holy shit who had that idea? The only way to shake those is to use their shitty AI against them and do a lot of 180s. But if you are in the open you are basically screwed. They do a lot of damage and are really hard to dodge. Also more often then not the cops take themselfes out without any player input. 

So yeah in conclusion its a decent NFS but with some major flaws.

In a nutshell the game delivers the physics quite well as grip cars feel great to drive and you don't have to drift your way into victory and it makes the game feel fun. Cop chases are nothing too worrying but can feel ""hard"" to a certain extent but nothing too crazy but after that, that's were things end off for me. And yeah you still have the cool customization options and cars too. 

Like the game is fine but it doesn't feel or have enough content, the story of the game isn't anything to write home about (it's ok I guess) and it is very short and after that it becomes like Heat (no content). Online is fine and all but does have issues with balancing, the class system is cool and I do like the variety but it is very busted as people can use 488s in B-Class races which shouldn't be a thing and not only that, the ""matchmaking"" is from Heat meaning you have to host the races and wait for people to join instead of jumping into one which I am not a fan of. Though at least they're adding content (something I did mention before) I'm just hoping it doesn't turn into another Heat. 

Like I said the game is fine but it really isn't worth it at full price, just wait for a sale if you want to get the game or get something else.

EDIT: Some more hours poured upon and I gotta say the game is still fine but lacks any reason for me to come back. There's not any good content that is coming out and the game also feels dead, I mean people still play but in terms of racing it's hard to find a match and not only that there are no leader boards or any simple things like playing a race over and over or time trials. It's hard for me to generally practice my driving on a course or set a time because how much this lacks in the simple things. Overall I will still say the game is okish but honestly I'm losing reasons to play this game because the devs are not delivering hard enough.",1681589102,1689129475,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In the last decade the NFS series has been a pile of shit. At least in terms of style this one tries something different.
Obviously it's not worth the full price so play it with EA subscription or get it on sale.

Positive:
- Really good visuals and sounds
- The cartoon effects are actually cool and didn't bother me at all
- The car list and customisation is still a blast
- I didn't notice any rubberbanding during races
- The cop chases are not as frustrating like it was in NFS Heat
- More lively city with pedestrians
- A somewhat coherent story

Negative:
- Another garbage soundtrack (seriously there's only like 2-3 good tracks)
- Cringy characters again
- Limited restarts on races, and race buy-ins are unnecessary
- The progression system is worse than before
- Still no cockpit view
- Texture glitches

As you hit an inside curb, the wheels lift for a quick moment and causing them to lose traction. With less grip on the inside and more on the outside wheels of the car, it will turn further inwards of the car's center axis, thus improving cornering ability. 

Why did I say this? Because somehow the past few Ghost NFS games including Unbound, running on Frostbite 3, has the best-in-class surface collision amongst racing games, rivaling Assetto Corsa Competizione's 1.9 update. And what happens if your wheels do not touch the ground? The game detects you as ""Airborne"" and immediately triggers the air-steering ability, which straightens your car to prep itself for big jumps. A complete inversion of real-life driving.

This however means any curb on city streets and any downward slope on freeways can and [i]will[/i] raise the wheels, triggering the Airborne status and immediately straighten your car, causing understeer. Porpoising can happen as the vicious cycle repeats itself as you car understeering ultimately leads to more undulations straight ahead which you cannot possibly avoid without slowing down beforehand.

And that's just a technical issue. From a gameplay perspective, literally after EVERY race, regardless of what place I was in, the cops were chasing me.

Unbound would be hilariously bad if I hadn't spent money on it. This game is not worth it, even on sale for $20. Utterly insane grinding ""progression"" mechanics make it not only possible but LIKELY that you will at some point spend 20-30 minutes grinding a session to end up LOSING ground. Why do that? It's so unrewarding and un-fun. 

Rewards for races are absurdly low, meanwhile your NPC friends constantly remind you that you need new cars, you need upgrades, and you need to save up $20k for the next big race, all while you earn like $1500 per race and can very easily lose it all. 

Cops, while less like cruise missiles than in Heat (this is the ONLY improvement over Heat), are omnipresent. There must be 1 cop for every resident in Lakeview or whatever the generic city is. And once there are undercover cops? That's when I ragequit and won't play anymore. I was desperately grinding out yet another tooth-grinding session and carefully made my way back to a safehouse and an undercover cop popped up when the safehouse was in view. I ended up getting busted by some of the game's insane crash physics, and lost everything I had earned that night. Infuriating.

WHY doesn't the cursor snap to you location on the map?? WHY do I have to search for it? Awful design.

The graphics look decent EXCEPT for the new weird tag-style (but bad) additions. They look amateurish and garish. Many modern games have figured out good lighting effects and effect sparks. Not this one.

And OMG the driving mechanics. Yet another modern NFS that has no idea what driving a car is like. Controls feel truly random and somehow simultaneously sluggish and twitchy. Deeply unfun to lose a race because of the controls.

This game LOVES to introduce a weird gimmick in the last 10% of a race. Tunnels, jumps, going under bridges that looks like going into a black hole, etc. Again, very unrewarding to lead the race 90% of the way and then lose 5 places because of a gimmick.

Do yourself a favor, avoid this awful mess.",1688818937,1688818937,False,2,0,0.509433984756469727,0,True,False,False

The controls are on point, once you get use to it & used to the drifting mechanic.

However, the amount of cop chases after races gets a bit, too much and too forced at times.


Also, the biggest downside is the fact that the game regularly crashes on a GPU driver-error is very, very annoying when playing on a system that's above the recommended specs.
Even after going through multiple driver versions, going as far as overclicking the GPU (which leads to an instant crash upon launching by the way) to test things out.
Losing progress on this, which has happend from 0 to a max of 4 times per play session (before giving up on it for the day) is just a big pain in the ass.

- First and foremost the driving overall decent but there are moments where the car just decides that it really wants to lose control and hit the nearest family of 4, this can be very annoying as I've had to restart my races a few times because of it.

- Second The Art Style I really like. i know there was a lot of drama about it but overall I like the art style It's something new which is refreshing.

- Third THE FUCKING COPS I can't with the cops In this game they are more of a nuisance then a threat i cannot tell you how many times I've had to restart my races because a cop decided to body block me with their fat ass car, It can take forever to get to an event or a delivery because of the cops they spawn EVERYWHERE It's really annoying and frustrating. The game try's so hard to try heats risk reward system but it fails horribly at it the cops don't pose a threat so it encourages you to finish all of the events of that night or day. 

- Fourth The Soundtrack It just isn't there man the songs in this game just don't hit the right spots for me don't get me wrong there are a few that somewhat catch my attention but overall not good, I Prefer heats soundtrack over Unbounds.

- Fifth This game has a very limited amount of variety when it comes to races i'd say maybe like an hour of playing you would've already have played all of the races that the game has to offer. The races start getting repetitive because of the lack of variety.

- Sixth The Grind is so tedious and overall not fun it's very easy to get your car up to the required rank like 1 or 2 in game day and nights is usually what it takes to get it to where you need it, your not really gonna be sticking to 1 car as you require 4 for the final race one of every rank as you can imagine it's not really hard to get the cars to the ranks that you want them to be in.

So do I recommend this game? Full Price No, If it's on sale uhhh Maybe.

I just wanted to play this game to relax a bit and have fun in the beginner game mode but hey the game was built to piss you off. I spent half of my hours on this game running away from cops. There are times when they just would not leave you alone. I can't even drive in peace after a race. It's funny 'cause the cops act like a bunch of clowns when they chase us during a race but when you free roam they are out to grab you by your...

The only thoughts I had after that point was ""Tess please shut the f*ck up, your making me want to commit toaster bathtub.""  And another thing, EA please stop trying to make street racers look like the good guys. We are literally breaking the law, endangering civilians, killing police officers during pursuits, and causing millions in property damage. Just let us be the bad guy like Most Wanted 05.

Cars: Overall the car list is very good. The amount of customization is still amazing as usual. However, I noticed that some cars don't have the body kits or parts that they had in the previous games. For example, the Sunline Racing kit for the R34 is gone, for no reason... Why? Also I'm a bit disappointed that we still don't have parts form brands like Veiside, Top Secret, RE Amemiya, and Spoon to name a few. Despite those nitpicks, buying a car and customizing it is still a fun experience.

Gameplay/Physics: For a NFS game made by Criterion, the driving is actually pretty good. Grip is a viable option because they made it so drifting makes you loose a TON of speed, maybe a little too much making drift events boring af but it's whatever. The burst nitro does kind of break the physics where it deletes any momentum you had while sliding which you can use to your advantage on hard corners. Event variety is pretty bad tbh. You have circuit races, 3 different types of sprint races that are all named differently but are basically the same. Drift events are kind of boring like I said earlier because your going so slow, and Takeover events are like a gymkhana style event which is also boring to play.

Crash cameras: Why. No one asked for crash cams to return Criterion why did you add them back?

Music: Taste is subjective.... but I think most of us can agree that this game's licensed soundtrack f*cking sucks. Most of it is cringe crap that you'd find in the average Tik Tok video and there's only a few songs that I actually liked. The original composed soundtrack however is actually pretty good. The pursuit themes are good with a different one for each heat level and it's cool down. The rest of the ost plays when your free roaming and it's also very nice, but you can only hear it for about 30 seconds after you leave the garage or finish a event.

Visuals: The graphics are pretty good as to be expected and the anime effects are awesome. I don't care what anyone says, they're not that bad. They enhance what's happening in the moment and makes stuff like hitting the burst nitro more powerful than it actually is. 

Soooo I'd give this game a 7/10. It's really good in some areas but flops in a few others. If your a die-hard fan of the series get the standard edition of the game. Don't get the Palace edition, your not gonna be using the cars it comes with because 1, They don't have any custom parts like Heat's deluxe edition cars, and 2 you have to buy them when you unlock them and by the time you do unlock them you'll already have a car that's good enough in that class. If you've never played an NFS game before, I'd recommend this one only if it's on sale at 30% or higher. Ok bye :)",1688606005,1688606005,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I don't even know where to start with this pathetic excuse for a game. NFS Heat had some frustrating aspects to it but overall it was an enjoyable experience. This sequel gets rid of everything that was good about Heat and amplifies everything that was bad.

Let's start with tethering: what a joke of a system. I play games to relax, have fun and enjoy the story. The whole purpose of being able to choose your difficulty in a game is to be able to play how you want to play. Not in NFS Unbound. No sir. It doesn't matter if you choose the lowest difficulty setting because the game tethers you to the AI at all times. It doesn't matter how big your lead is. One mistake and you're done.

This conveniently leads to my next point: restart limitations. Are you kidding me? So the game is made to be as punishing as possible and we don't even have the option to restart as much as we want anymore? No thank you.

Point #3: Your car is tissue paper in every sense of the word. Hit a cop? Nothing happens to him. Hit a racer? Nothing happens to him. Get hit by a cop or a racer? You go flying off the road or spin out of control.

Speaking of control: driving at high speed in this game is an absolute joke. The slightest corner makes you lose all control of your car and one of three things usually happens: you hit a wall, you go off the road, you hit a car.

What is enjoyable about this game? Really? I am struggling to find a single thing. You get punished for wanting to play casually. You get punished for driving too fast. You get punished for battling with other racers and cops. You get punished for being unlucky and landing on top of a car off of a jump and other random events. Then you get punished for restarting. I don't play games to be punished. I play games to have fun. And this is the most unfun experience I have ever had playing a game. So much so that this is my first time ever returning a game on here.

Unlike NFS Heat, this game didn't disappoint me as much. It's not the greatest NFS out there, but it's certainly an improvement from last time. I think this game took many steps forward in certain aspects and a few steps back in others. Specifically, the story mode is much, much longer in this one (took me 30+ hours to finish) but on the other hand, it's way too monotonous with very little variety in events and activities. This causes the story mode to drag a little, especially after Week 2 of the in-game calendar. Regardless, this game is very entertaining and a great way to spend your evenings.

[h1]Individual ratings[/h1]
[u]Car list:[/u] [b]9/10[/b]
MASSIVE car list, but... there's no Audi cars ??? What happened?

[u]Car customization:[/u] [b]9/10[/b]
The game doesn't tell you how customizable a car is before you buy it, which is another step back from NFS Heat. Other than that, it's similar, if not better than NFS Heat.

[u]Graphics:[/u] [b]8.5/10[/b]
The graphics are great and a massive step forward since NFS Heat. You can tell they probably used Codemaster's Ego engine lighting code, since this game's and GRID Legends' reflections look almost identical. Sadly, since it's Frostbite, the textures take a long time to load and there's a LOT of pop-ins of objects and textures.

[u]Driving:[/u] [b]7.5/10[/b]
The handling in this game is actually pretty good. It's not perfect, but it's much better than Heat. I like that it's not trying to be super realistic and implements mechanics like sideways-momentum cancelation after using Boost-Nitrous. It makes the game feel kind of like a Kart game, but I like it.

[u]Map:[/u] [b]6.5/10[/b]
There's just something about Lakeshore which makes it... kinda dull. There's definitely less emptiness in this map than in NFS Heat's map, but there's still nothing too remarkable about it. I really like the gameplay on it though, they made sure to put many ramps and slopes around to allow players to perform insane jumps everywhere.

[u]Events:[/u] [b]6/10[/b]
Simply not enough variety. Off-Road races are gone and there's still not Drag races.

[u]Story:[/u] [b]6/10[/b]
It's just... there. Some characters are more cringe than NFS 2015, but some are actually very well written. It's a very safe story with nothing too memorable.

[u]Progression:[/u] [b]6/10[/b]
It's very slow, but fair... but maybe a bit too slow for a game. Luckily you are given many, many cars, basically for free while playing story events.

[u]Multiplayer:[/u] [b]6/10[/b]
Not gonna lie, they might be onto something. It's actually really fun but only until you finish your Speed Pass. After that there's no point in playing it anymore.

[u]Music:[/u] [b]5/10[/b]
I actually don't mind it. There's much more songs in this one than in NFS Heat, but some song choices are just... ""meh"".

[u]DLC content:[/u] [b]2/10[/b]
What the f**k ??? For the price of a kidney you get borderline nothing. DO NOT BUY THE DLCs FOR THIS GAME !!! This includes the Palace Edition, it's not worth it AT ALL !!!

I played it on the hardest difficulty and boy it was great. For me it was for sure better than Heat.


I really adore that it shakes up different things and mostly succeeds at it:

The set time limit until the next big race generates a nice pressure on what risks to take and how to spend your money. It really got me engaged in the game. Because money is also much harder to get than normal you really need to do some difficult decisions.
In a time of Forza Horizon, where you get hundrets of cars just by playing the game, i very much enjoy that you need to put some work and thoughts into your car choice.

Also, i noticed no annoying rubberbanding. And the secondary nitro bar where you get additional boost by doing risky stuff or just by driving clean added additional dynamics to the races.


Sure some things are controversial:

For example there is no fast travel. You have to avoid cops or you are pretty much always chased. This could be mitigated half way through the game though.

Or the strong colorful driving effects that you can't turn off, but i got used to that pretty fast.

And the game is less drifting focused, but for me this is also a nice change of things. I don't recall drifting that much in NFS Most Wanted 2005 either ;)


I have only three main criticisms: 

Like with Heat, you couldn't really know if a car performs good enough to keep up in its class, so you have to hope that your hard earned money is well spend. You can unlock some cars to compensate for this, but i tried to use cars i buy myself.

In general the cop chases worked and were difficult enough to really think twice about trying to escape max heat cops with a B to A+ car. But they are still fairly dumb and there are no creative ways to lose them (like crashing buildings, having active skills, ...). It felt like needing to do specific things to confuse them or exploit their dumb behavior. This can be much improved.

And the main big thing: There are way too less tracks. And i played the game after they added some more. It's nice that races in slower classes are still played because sometimes they get you more money. But a game with this length need at least 30-50% more tracks to be varied enough.


For me a good NFS is a linear single player experience with good and different handling, atmospheric racing and some new ideas. And Unbound delivers.

At the time of writing this played 45 Hours, the game overall will feel fun enough but when there are BullSh*t moments you feel them ridiculously hard, also it will make you install EA Play and boot through that when you press play on Steam.

Pros: 
+ Solo is fun enough, vroom vroom
+ If you like cars its got a decent selection (not nearly as much as forza horizon games)
+ Art style is cool, but limited
+ Community got some good wraps for your cars
+ Throwbacks to previous games in the form of cars and styles.

Cons:
- Cops are hyper aggressive on the easiest difficulty and can fuck up $300k+ runs because they don't stop spawning and rubberbanding at warp speed straight into the back your car.
- Don't have a chance to escape cops except on easiest difficulty.
- S+ events you will need to bring your car rating up to 400+ on easy to have a chance of beating them.
- On multiple occasions racers have rubber banded from 700+m away to 60m very blatant.
- Story is mid as hell, cringe nae nae baby zoomer stuff. very bad plot and makes the cringiest references to previous games and name drops itself ""If you ever feel the uhhh.... the need. the need for speed ya'know?"" -_-
- Online has a separate garage from multiplayer. BUT singleplayer challenge cars carry over (stock versions)
- Soundtrack is very small and repetitive, subjectively there are like only 1 or 2 good songs.
- Connection errors when trying to change a part on the car will result in needing to back out to the main menu after every selection to make sure all the mods get added (happens maybe once a week or so, server-side)",1688450677,1688450677,False,2,0,0.516129016876220703,0,True,False,False

Stupid AI!! Badly designed tracks, you will bump into a random divider or a tree during a race, if you skid off slightly or press the brakes an AI racer will overtake you immediately. AI vehicles appear randomly after a jump or a curve on the road, AI cops will literally fly into you. They will chase you after an exhausting frustrating race and sometimes it's really annoying and irritating to lose them. 
Car's which are paid for in the DLC are locked! You have to pay with in-game currency which takes an excruciating time to collect in races. In game side tasks like speed traps are useless and unachievable when you get hit by cops or a random AI vehicle / barricade!

even though this hasn't got any of the death metal, heavy metal or stuff like that I am into the soundtrack is still great for the games setting.

car models are absolutely stunning and wraps made by the community are so good I am tempted to make my own soon.

even though not as fast as Need for Speed Most Wanted its still a bloody fast game and I can dig it.

I really like the athestic appeal with the trails that come off your car and stuff that happens in the environment like in cutscenes.

Unsure whats up with the swearing and stuff not very use to people swearing in a need for speed game and I got no idea whats up with the sort of anime style of the characters however I can let that slide.

The game isn't worth 60 of my Great British Pounds but I got this on sale after I got a diploma and given some extra money from my dad cause of it.

Despite the game's price tag its still bloody fun and I wouldn't blame you if you still brought it at full price, my suggestion is wait for a sale however still great game and I am slowly gaining trust in EA again, just going to hope they don't back stab me if I trust them too much.

The amount of grinding you have to do (likely with friends) is not worth the cars you get in the end for online play. If you're new, expect to get stomped on by players who have been on since day 1 experimenting with builds. The sheer lack of content in this game is starkly noticeable, even down to shit like the camera (No tilt function? No filters?), but it becomes very obvious at the endgame. Once you get the thing you want in online, or finish the story, there is very little incentive to pick the game up again.

This game has been out since December 2nd and it has STILL not received a major patch. EA physics are still sending people flying into the stratosphere, and the cops will attempt to do that to you as soon as they know it's you. If you';re used to the cops in Heat, you're in for a very rude awakening. The cops in this game behave (at times) more aggressively than in Most Wanted, and they're frankly much better armed than they were, too.

Driving between meetups is very cool, I like how the game feels real in that aspect. But truth be told this is one of the very few good things about the game. They've used recycled power adder sounds from the last game, and while you can make it more obvious by boosting the power adder audio in engine tuning, you still get telltale EA glitches like your supercharger whine spontaneously going missing if you switch camera angles.

Do NOT pay 70 dollars for this. Wait for it to go on sale. This game, to me, is a weak attempt to keep fans happy while they make other projects, and it becomes VERY obvious only once you finish the game.

Edit: Vol 3
With some of the tweaks they've made for base payout of races, it is now significantly easier to get cash for the rides you want. However, the grind is still long and arduous for cars like the new Challenger, which you have to wreck 30 players while racing online to unlock.

Drift playlists are cleverly engineered so as to not have players running into each other, the entire focus is on your line and your line alone. With the addition of the Season Pass, they've awarded players 250K for each ""season"" you've been playing. If you're been playing since launch like me, this yields a free 750K as a thanks for playing. These honestly feels pretty good.

Graphical glitches are now the name of the game. At time the screen lags behind the visuals/freezes, blacks out entirely, or worse becomes an epileptic's worst nightmare with a barrage of bright colors flashing very quickly while still giving you the sounds of racing, but none of the visuals you need to race. Once, I beat another player in a Camaro who then left, leaving me by myself to make a run at an endurance race using only my map for guidance. Rather infuriating, tbr. And before you ask, yes, I've updated my graphics drivers, and my software is as up-to-date as it can be.",1678544792,1688331050,False,4,0,0.549590528011322021,0,True,False,False

The new additions to the game make it so much more enjoyable in the online modes, seeing them including new modes and content after release is always good, fixing bugs and stuff.
I keep my word that it is too expensive, so, if you get it at discound, it's a good deal.


[h1] Good with a discount [/h1]
TL;DR: Get it at discount, it's fun as fuck.

The racing experience is amazing, specially if you don't like drifting like me, the option to change it to grip is the best thing that has happened to NFS in terms of physics.
Every car feels different and that's a pro for me.

Races are fun and challenging in high difficulties (In story mode), and the online is simply too fun, specially after Vol. 2. 

The graphics are fine, the city feels good to run at, but that's just the minimum we can expect from a NFS.

Cops are fun as fuck, challenging and annoying, i personally like it that way, specially in the online mod when it's optional to start a pursuit, not as good as older games, might need some touches, but it's fun.

This is a small plus, shoutouts to the the Online racers, they are an amazing community, I had more clean races here than in other ""Arcade"" games like older Forza Horizon, which is weird but i appreciate it.

Even like that it has some bad points:
- Bugs.
- Horrible story mode.
- The music might not be for everyone, at the end it's way cooler to have spotify on.
- The graphics might be buggy using an HDD, which is a letdown if you still use them. 
- Lacks content in the story mode.
- Might be repetitive.
- IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE, i got it at 49% of discount and even like that i feel it's too expensive.

I invite everyone that loves a good online racing experience, and doesn't have Heat, to get it, but not at full price.",1679895879,1688253354,True,0,0,0.50168919563293457,0,True,False,False

buut the player cars have serious acceleration issues, the easiest difficulty states the opponent racers aren't supposed to be very competitive... yet they leave you in the dust, the events aren't able to be done multi times in one day, the controls to start a drift were more responsive in NFS heat (used the same controller I use for heat), and MY BIGGEST ISSUE with the game, the limited race restarts... is the WORST possible mechanic that could've been made...

Pros:
Unique art style, though this can be a con depending on how you see it
Difficult progression starting out, I personally like this, but I know a lot of people disliked it
Updated handling from heat, grip builds are actually good now
Beautiful graphics
Decent car list
Great customization
Paying to get into events adds a new level of intensity when racing, which I like

Cons:
Updates aren't as frequent as I would like, which wouldn't be an issue if the updates were a bit larger, but when they do update stuff, its usually like one car and some new multiplayer events
has a ""Speed Pass"", essentially the same thing as like a battle pass
Story is short and pretty basic
Dialogue is okay-ish at best
Cops absolutely suck, the cops in the first two heat levels can't go over 100 mph, and every unit is incredibly easy to wreck,  even the raptors can be wrecked easily if you know what your doing
Soundtrack is questionable at best, though music is pretty subjective, I only like a few songs in the game
Multiplayer is weird, your singleplayer save does not transfer over, though you will get cars that you win in singleplayer races in multiplayer, you can also only race against other players, which causes obvious issues if your trying to grind and your not into PVP like me

- Yes, it requires EA client, and what? It's not spyware. (I bet that you wouldn't have problem with FIFA needing an EA LAuNchEr.)
- The bear collection is stupid.
- The Multiplayer has lack of features, but is nothing that can't be changed with updates. (Let's hope there will be more then one.)

[h1] Gameplay and Story [/h1]
If you have played some of the most recent entries in the Need for Speed series since the 2015 reboot then this will feel largely the same in terms of the controls and overall handling of the gameplay itself which isn't a bad thing at all as it has helped up quite well all things considered although this style or arcade racer may not be to everyone's liking.
The story is short and sweet, while i didn't care much for it to begin with, i had the same feelings once i finished it, not bad by any means but nothing memorable but does enough to help breakup just driving all the time.


[h1] Graphics [/h1]
Graphically Need for Speed Unbound is very similar to the previous title in the series, Need for Speed Heat.
Car models all look fantastic and customisation once again looks incredible and never looks out of place or unrealistic.
A controversial decision EA made came in the form of the cartoon/animated style characters and while at first i wasn't a fan, the more i played the more that design choice actually grew on me, i feel it is done well enough that it separates it from other games of its genre but also doesn't feel tacked on or just a gimmick idea. Same goes for the vehicle effects, actually really like the idea and definitely feel it adds that little bit extra to the game to set it apart from the others and also makes the online component a lot more unique with all the different ideas and designs other players have combined.
At times this game can look absolutely stunning and other times can look like a bit of a mess but overall no complaints from me and i see it as an improvement over NFS Heat which was already a good looking game.


[h1] Fun Factor [/h1]
This game is quite fun and always has something to want you to play again, definitely a ton of replay value especially with friends in the online component of the game.
A game is only as good as you want it to be so while i can't speak for everyone, i myself do return to it quite a bit because their is always something to do or to be found.

[b] Final Thoughts [/b]
Overall a great game with plenty of hours of content to keep you glued to it and that's before you even touch the online component.
I wish the map had a bit more to offer although i feel it's just the right size without feeling too cramped or too big with wasted space.
Performance is very good, i do get some stuttering sometimes usually after a long sessions but a quick restart of the game fixes this.

Would definitely recommend waiting for a sale as it doesn't have a Triple A feel to it but that's just my feelings on it

Game manages to maintain a good level of arcade/simulation ratio by allowing players to adapt their mastery of racing games by changing the difficulty. Speaking about difficulty - this game feels like Dark Souls of racing games.  On the negative parts - I would say that story, dialogues and writing feels like a big ""in-your-face"" appeal to zoomers and it is most visible in the soundtrack as well, which mainly consists of hip-hop.

It takes the need for speed heat approach (which I'd say is the best nfs game since underground) and mixes it up in a way I feel is a little more balanced from a single player point of view. It's fun, it give you reason to use more than one car and makes it fun to build out your garage. 

On the other hand I do have a lot of problems. Single player and online being separate is a change from heat that i dislike. Having to buy and  re customize the same car across modes is a pain. I made a car I was super proud of and had no way to show my friend without rebuying and building a carbon copy. The cartoony aesthetic I can give or take, it looks ok but it's pretty jarring at times. The one button drift/break system isn't always accurate, and I think the dedicated drift button will always be better.

I have to point out that ea needs to fire everyone on their writing team. The cringe is powerful and overbearing. If it were a movie I would be considered the true best worst movie ever. Every line of dialog is pain. I found it funny at some point in the story there was a raido ad for an old out if touch politician trying to be hip with the young folk in a cringe over the top way, and to be honest it's parody reflects the very game its in. These writers are out of touch and cringe, and the voice actors don't sound natural saying all the slang either. Insert hello fellow teenager meme. 

And the whole cops hating street racers more than crack dealers, while the racers refuse to see a problem with their actions is silly. Why do the cops hate us so much? ""We are just trying to live our lives going 201 mph in a school zone. How does that hurt anyone?"" At least it has asap rocky, which is cool but its mostly him losing races and rambling into the universe.

It plays pretty similar to Heat with improved cops and a more interesting campaign set up where you approach the weeks to the final race and you'll have to scramble to finish your car before then. The reason i refunded this was because of the handling. I used the Silvia as the starter car, and the thing just wouldn't turn. 

Game feels great when you're weaving traffic at high speeds, but the second you need to rotate the car, it'll lock up on you and kill all momentum. And to be honest i felt like this handling model would be a common trend for the rest of the cars in the game. Turning feels like a slog, and even if you were to get good at the physics model, i just can't see it being fun at all. Controlling the car just feels like a chore. 

Miss the UG and MW era of NFS games, those handling models were super tight and responsive, and you feel like you could feel the car understeer believably, and the speed losses from drifting too much felt much much more natural. In Unbound it felt like drifting would just check a state in the game to slow you to a halt, and when the handling model focuses quite heavily on it for a lot of the cars, it just bad.

Sadly, I just cannot recommend this title. This is because of three core issues that when wound together just break what makes arcade racers so great.
[u]NOTE - In Unbound the Single Player and Multiplayer are split[/u] - [strike] This could have been very interesting and well implimented, but as you will see, it's not.[/strike] 

[h1]1: Core Gameplay Loop [/h1] 
[u] Single Player[/u] 
In Unbound's single player, you have one goal in life. Make money. Characters and Story won't drive you because it's lacklustre (and poorly acted if you choose the male VA), and chances are there's only two or three cars you particularly care about them having added, so out you go on the grind with a pedal and some fresh tyres to a meetup to start a race (this will become important later) here is where we hit our first major flaw. [u] The race pool is [i]small[/i][/u]. Not only is the race pool small, but multiple are very, very similar and with races often being exclusive to a class, the already small race pool gets smaller There are three event types. Racing (circuit & sprint), Drift (not in-depth at all) and the poorly received DLC Speedcross events from Payback just reskinned and with one of three voicelines from A$AP Chonky. Now, you've got your cash you will likely have to evade the police.  

In unbound, the cops were weak at launch and weaker after some recent changes to their AI and some UI alterations. They serve no purpose other than to slow your money grind and in possibly the most egregious part of this system, they spot you through walls and spawn around you the moment you start losing the police. They're [i][u]easy[/i][/u] to escape even in the lowest class cars, but with these other two factors tied in it can take forever to evade and escape back to the safe house if you're not in a fast, and you just feel like pressing alt-f4 and visiting any other title. There's no satisfaction here & it also means you avoid slower class events 

Now then. You've evaded the cops and want to do more races. So you can go pretty much anywhere on the map and find an event using that areas unique map design, right? [u]Wrong[/u]. 

You need to visit one of roughly 6 locations to start an event, remember, making an already repetitive genre with a repetitive loop even more repetitive... 

I've played repetitive titles, Hell, the entirety of the 2000's was filled with artificially stretched games. But they gave you something to work towards, new visual mods, new cars, new races and map areas, new AI to beat, the next edge on raising the stakes with the cops, [strike]maybe even a story that you cared about.[/strike] Welcome to 2022/3, where you just don't get rewarded for playing. 

The Day/Night cycle makes no difference other than aesthetics and the skin on some secondary events. You do this for far, far too long and eventually start skipping as much as you can to get it over with. 

[u]Online[/u] 

In the multiplayer, you also just want money. Oh wait, no, you have to unlock [u]all[/u] those cars from the single player [u]again[/u], only this time in a (modern/new) CoD weapon style unlock system. So, go to one of the seven locations, hope and pray somebody is interested in joining the same limited events, and grind. I'd be much more forgiving if the car unlocks were shared across the single player and multiplayer, with different challenges to unlock the cars depending on which mode you were playing & considerably less grind. 

  

[h1]2: The Driving & Physics[/h1] 

[u]This obviously goes for both single player and online[/u] 

The driving in Unbound is an interesting one. It feels slightly weightier than previous entries which is good, and you can create ""grip"" build cars now, forsaking Brake2Drift (or double-tap throttle 2 drift). You have two NOS bars, one a three-stage ""powershot"" (or ""burst"") that you earn by doing anything, but has to be used quickly or it will disappear, and a conventional ""burn"" NOS that you earn for the exact same things but can be stored and used when necessary. 

Despite this driving in Unbound is not as strong not as strong as previous entries, even with those games having their own problems and less choice in how you drive. 

Car control in Unbound is fiddly, inconsistent and loose. You can and will randomly lose control of your steering for tiny durations of turns. This most often happens because of your tyres switching between surfaces or hitting curbs or other tiny bumps. Going from Grip to Drift in one turn feels very much like an on/off switch.  

If you build a"" Grip"" car and get a random slide from clipping or the surface changes, often resulting in a death wobble that saps time and feels awful. Grip is just understeer, any slides induced are [u]always[/u] from clipping or surface changes and never induced by pushing too hard. 

With ""Drift"" handling, the lack of control over your tyres and this hint of 2015's on rails drifting makes this handling awful. You may think we can finally overcook a drift and spin out, but this isn't possible, you can only ever turn slightly too tight than you wanted to. 

It's hard to explain the handling/physics in words unfortunately, and I know people who laud Unbound's handling as the second coming of Christ. For me, it's just not it. Every turn feels artificial and planned out for me, and that's not what racing is about. 

Tapping the powershot NOS in a drift will propel you forwards no matter the slide or position which is a handy tool making turns quicker and racing lines less obvious and changing depending on the size of your burst NOS bar before the turn. That is unless it doesn't, it can result in death wobble, and sometimes it just doesn't appear to change your momentum/velocity at all. Activation is also poor, with one button to activate both. 

  

[h1]3: The Map[/h1] 
I'll try to keep this short and sweet. 
The map is underutilised and heavily lacking in diversity. 
You have: 
[list] 
[*]That one hill with some windy bits of road (only here it's not very tall or long) 
[*]The city with no real landmarks made on an etch a sketch with one hand 
[*]Some also quite square fields 
[*]Ramps and jumps placed randomly 
[/list] 

And that's about it - it truly is an videogame map 

You experience probably 15% of the map in the race list, 50% if you are doing the awfully boring one-time collectables that have been plaguing NFS since Payback.

The map is the most important part of a racing game. It needs to be distinct, varied and fun to drive with exploration being encouraged by the landscape and ""reveals"" of what lays ahead. Having a sense of natural, non GPS guided direction in the world not only helps players learn it, but allows for quicker navigation and would allow for different event types such as point-to-point races. 

The map also is cursed by this Forza Horizon style design. You can go anywhere, with some random exceptions. There are ramps that dot the landscape just because they can. This waters down the experience a lot and further takes away from your natural inner compass. Think to the GTA maps, think to older NFS maps. Think of maps from Midnight Club. These all have landmarks and landscape reveals, distinct geography or architecture. These all let you naturally navigate through the landscape. Even London Racer on the PS1 understood these concepts. Burnout understood this and that game franchise revelled in the destruction of anything you could lay your eyes on.

In short. Unbound is a disappointment. It doesn't meaningfully improve on the previous titles and is missing content & game modes. Combine this with poor driving and one of the weakest maps in post-reboot NFS, it's just not an easy sell and that's before you get to the controversial comic-book art style and lack of atmosphere.

I play solo, offline. 
For every hour of game play, I spend 45mins evading cops. I JUST evade one heat lvl 5 chase, only to have helicopters spawn ON TOP OF ME! Or Cop cars spawn ON TOP OF ME(NOT undercover cops), They literally appear in the air and drop to the road in front of me. 
I spend 5 mins evading them, shaking them off, hide to get over the chase, and turn a corner and there's cops EVERYWHERE. 

And when ever you use the in game GPS to get a route to an objective, they spawn cops ALL OVER your objective.

I want play this game for FUN... I want to RACE... Not play cops and robbers. 

If the devs simply put a slider in the settings that allowed us to adjust how many/aggressive the cops were, this would be a great game I would recommend. 
Even having the game on easiest settings, the cops are just too much.

Without mods, it handles and drifts terribly, and it's also annoying in general to play. It's not anything like the driving in NFS Heat.

EA decided to try something new with this game, giving it an sort of anime-style art style with cool effects and such, and I think it's pretty neat.

I also feel this game is better than the game that came before it, 2019's Need For Speed Heat, as it does a lot of stuff better than that game.

The game features stuff not previously seen in Heat, such as a Tier system for cars, where you can build & upgrade your cars around 5 specific tiers - S+, S, A+, A & B - and the cops, while annoying, are more dynamic as you increase your heat level, such as sending out Interceptor Corvettes at heat 3, or Heavy SWAT Trucks at heat 5. 

I also like the Day/Night system, where you build heat during the day & carries into night, unlike the Day/Night system in Heat where you only earn heat during nighttime.

However i think the game's best feature is the new system for your nitrous boost. It gives you a new yellow burst nitrous bar that you fill by performing risky driving, such as jumps, driving in oncoming, etc. When activated, it gives you a massive burst of speed, great for getting away from cops & catching up if you fall behind in a race.

To say this game is disappointing is an understatement.

I cannot begin to describe how grindy this game is. Every day is the same as the last. You unlock a few more races as the game progresses, but so so many events are re-used. A lot of these races were fun the first time I did them. But the longer you play, the more races you redo.

The ""drifting"" events are the worst I've ever seen. They call drift events a ""takeover"" (why on earth would you support takeover culture??), in which you jump around and drift on mud and hit barrels. Not exactly drifting.

Car customization is okay. A lot of these kits are bit too much on the stance culture side for me. Car selection is fair, and addition of engine swaps is a good idea.

The only positive points are the visuals and car customizations.

- the story is bad, but who cares its NFS
- still no turn off option for visual damage
- too much modern and super cars
- class restricted races
- only PvP, no PvE online
- too few racetracks
- too hard cop chases
- the drifting is uncontrollable, unplayable
- crossplay with console (PS, Xbox) cheaters
- the music is so bad

At this point why are you trying to make a story in every NFS??? Drop the idea at all and focus only on the cars and gameplay. No one cares about the story. The last good story was in Most Wanted (2005) and Carbon. Thats it. We dont need a story just give us a starter money and cars and a city to race on its streets.

The game looks amazing and you can build your dream car as you want. The customization options are awesome. From the different cool looking bumpers to the tinted headlights you can do so many things to your cars. You can make your car nice or rice if you are a cringe kid. But thats all. When you step out to the world and drive for like a minute your brand new dream car get scretched like you used it for the past 20 years without maintance. After a race your car looks like you stole it from the junkyard, cause there is no race in NFS where you dont drive from wall to wall and hit at least 2 npc cars. I still dont understand why they cant put the option in to turn off damage visuals. They did it with the 2D smokes and wings so... I dont want to watch my car almost falling apart.

Please bring back the cars, actual cars, not these spaceships from star trek with the lowest stance ever and mega spoiler so called supercars. NFS is about tuning cars and illegal street races not about ""look how rich I am I can afford this spaceship with wheels"". Okay there is a fanbase for these cars but dont make half of the gallery contain supercars. Whats with cabrios? Some cars have a ""regular"" and a cabrio version, who the heck plays with cabrios? I never saw one, never. This game is about tuning ""slow cars"" to be ""fast cars"". Whats the point of making factory fast cars even more faster? To finish a race in 2 min? Sounds fun (not realy). Bring in more 80's, 90's and early 2000's cars and more car names like Opel, Skoda. I need cars that are different, cars that are unique. Today every car look almost the same.

Why there are car classes from B to S+ if the majority of the players plays in S+ ? It would make sense if there were PvE but no that would be fun and playable but its not allowed to have fun. Seriusly, why no PvE??? I feel forced to play certian classes and races just because everyone in the session farming on 1 racetrack. If I want to race slow and stylish, in lower classes, on the event I  want to race in, I cant, until there is a newbie or another unfortunate soul that would join my event. It happens very rarely. How the hell new players even level up? This system makes the gameplay unnecessarily long. Half of the time I wait and in the other half Im running away from cops.

The cops way too hard. I want to have fun not sweating all the time. They are everywhere and the chases go from 0 to 100 in no time. Its okay to have cops and all but every freaking time I finish a race I cant drive to another destination but end up in a 15 minute cop chase. And I cant even immobilze them cause I take the same damage as them.

What happened to the drifting mechanic? The last game was HEAT and the drifting was fine. Did you fired the guy who made it and hired a part timer student from a high school?

The crossplay is all fun and games until these motherflippers with their shitty modded consoles switch cars from lower to upper classes at the start of the race, fly to the moon, teleport back to flip you up and speed boost to the finish line.

The soundtrack is just awfull. Its just one genre. Not much to say...

I still cant imagine how we come from a shadowy black figure driving cool cars to the customizable clowns driving boring supercars.

Personal libtard gripes:
-The level of diversity in the game feels like an lgbtq world fair... And I'm not saying this cus I'm phobic, I myself am trans. It just feels a little rediculous that this many hyper unique peiople are living in bootleg detroit.
-obligatory Trans character is again F2M (rip) but + as a flip side actually sounds more realistically ""average"" when it comes to vocal training

vol.2 pretty good update, adds cops. played for a few days with friends.

Some things to consider though:
- With such a huge map, 16 player servers are too small especially since linkups are a thing now.
- Would be great to see AI cars in free roam(both modes) AND multiplayer races. AI don't need to add to the reward tally but at least it will make it more fun filling up the races. To see AI drive around in free roam would also add a nice touch to having an even more livelier map.

+ Excellent visuals. The neutral tone of environment and the over-saturated tone of driving effects just makes the artstyle pop.

+ Good car selection with a ton of customization. With how game development works, you either have to settle for 150 cars with tons of customization or 500+ cars with low customization. I personally prefer more customization.

+ Cops are implemented well. It never feels overwhelming or too easy. Maybe a bit annoying when you don't want to engage in a chase during freeroam, but otherwise it's pretty good.

+ Sound design is impressive. Boosts and drifts feel very punchy with the perfectly timed pops. Exhaust tone can be customized.

[b]Neutral[/b]
[hr][/hr]
~ The economy is too tight. The progression feels earned, but I'd say rewards need a massive boost. Ideally, I'd like to have every car in the garage after some grinding, but the current system is too restrictive. Easy way to fix this would be to scale the rewards with heat level; this would also give cop chases a purpose.

~ There is no fast travel.

~ A$AP Rocky's involvement in the game is quite good. Wish he had a more integral part in the story.

[b]Cons[/b]
[hr][/hr]
- Handling model is just awful. It is unpredictable and never really finds the balance even with 100% grip/drift tunes. The drifting handling model feels entirely different to normal handling model and it just throws you off every time.

- Gamepad controls cannot be reassigned. This is just embarrassing.

- Drifting slows you down faster than braking in a straight line. I know it's an arcade, but game design choices like this are the reason why the core driving experience feels off.

- Story is pretty mediocre. We never even meet the person who orchestrates the events in prologue. The redemption arc is horrible.

- It's a matter of personal taste, but the soundtrack is just awful.

- Online experience is very bare bones. Meta cars are leagues better than competition, and there is really only one meta car in each class.

- Locked content in online is outrageous. Play 30 playlists (1 playlist = 3 races) in a specific manufacturer to unlock specific car is too grindy. Money is already tight, so let players buy what they want.

[b]Update After Vol 3[/b]
[hr][/hr]
- The game hasn't evolved much since the release. Post launch content is not up to the mark.

- The paid DLC cars are the final nail in the coffin for me. What little post launch content this game has had is locked behind paid DLC. This game competes with Forza and Crew which have excellent post-launch content, and this is poor showing from EA.

I enjoyed the single player content, and I'd still recommend the game on a deep (70%+) sale.",1670243300,1687285803,False,0,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

That is a stupid argument. Don't be stupid. Skill is not indicative of enjoyment, and I have better things to do than bash my head on what I personally feel are bad / mediocre games on the off chance I could maybe like them one day. I have a life and don't play games in order to develop Stockholm syndrome.

I played in 4k on a 4080 & Intel 13700KF processor with all current drivers and patches manually installed on Windows 11 x64. All options were set to their highest level except AA and blur.
I played with an XBox One X controller.

I will update this review if I continue to play and have more to add and will leave comments on.

PROS:
- Achievements.
- Zero bugs that I noticed during my time with it.

NEUTRAL:
- I felt the music was godawful, but your tastes may vary. If you like indistinguishable generic modern rap, you may like this.

CONS:
- The cops... holy hell. Want to get to your next race? They're going to drop more cops around you than a downtown Antifa riot. Cops will be CONSTANT. Didn't have any interest in starting your forty-third chase in a row? TOO BAD! Better escape or else you've lost all your money! Which especially crappy because...
- The progress is ASTOUNDINGLY slow. Better complete three races for slightly better brakes for one car! Good thing you can just sell your old parts so you can recoup some of that lost time... oh... you can't? Oh no. Can I put parts on other vehicles? No? So there's a sunk cost in EVERY UPGRADE? Oh no. And then when you want the next tier, you have to buy the ability to buy parts from that tier? Why? Dunno. It's never explained in-game, but it's to make you grind. Everyone likes grinding in racing games, right? Did we mention that you're expected to upkeep multiple vehicles? OH NO.
- There is little to see on the map that's interesting. They've tried to stack some stuff here and there, but somehow even with fake ""people"" and collectables, it feels like a generic ""nowhere""  setting like most NFS games.
- The AI is tuned incredibly poorly. Either they're WAY ahead of you even though you're driving a better car, or they're moments away from the game rubber-banding them ahead of you despite a race-ruining crash they just had. They can somehow break the sound barrier in a '92 Toyota Tercel when the game decides that it's had enough of you having fun. There is no adjusting this and it is infuriating. Hey EA, you know it's okay for a player who is racing well to win a race. It's fine.
- The controls never felt right the entire time I played. They're never as drift-y as they should be when you want to drift, and they're always too loose when you're on the street. They suit nothing well. You CAN manually adjust the car twice per day, but you won't know the races coming up until you're out so... better hope you picked correctly and don't shift disciplines?
- For some reason, even with the options set to Ultra on almost everything, the game still looks like low-budget dog excrement. From the goofy-looking character models to the horrible ""urban cool"" clothes on everything to the unnaturally harsh & jagged edges on every in-game object; I've never before seen 4k look this low-res. Something is going on with the rendering here and it looks BAD.

DID YOU FINISH THE GAME?:
No. I respect myself too much to play any more of this mediocre excuse for a game.

Alright, after 130 hours into the game (both online and offline mode) combined from EA app and steam, suffice to say I'm not going to recommend the game, although yes it had lots of good things, all of them overshadowed by lots of bad things too.

Some positives are:
1. Better graphics (pretty good in my opinion) compared to previous titles
2. Some new cars with new kits and customizations
3. Pedestrians finally in the game making the city more alive
4. Sprint races are fun against AI (until you realize the game has rubberbanding after a certain point)
5. Grip mode added for more realistic gameplay (still arcade but it's much better than skidding everytime)

Some negatives are:
1. Story sucks so hard (yes I know NFS doesn't exactly do story telling, but c'mon, racers against the government trying to stop you from ruining the city? Or revenge against your supposed BFF cause she stole your car? I mean yeah it's good in theory but dialogues were terrible to say the least)
2. Literally just lots of cars reused from Heat (previous title from 2019) and some of them had kits removed here (3 years for this? meh)
3. Outrageous cops spawning near your location (Why? They spawn near you so suddenly, it's just unfair and unrealistic. My solution was to kinda have far spawning location instead of near your location)
4. Weird car crash issues (sometimes you thought it was fair, but oftentimes it's weird to see your car flipping after slight tap against wall on a certain speed)
5. Muffled engine sound (I maxed out the volume slider but it still too quiet)
6. Soundtracks kinda meh, too repetitive, I usually got heeeey we want sum moneh or some weird japanese mumbling rap (wish it had more variations tho, I like rap but please add more variations like EDM or rock music or something)
7. No progression after The Grand Finale in single player mode, only repeating 1 week of playlist (I wish it had some kind of new game where you can keep challenging TGF every 4 week, it was fun but too short for a full price AAA games)

I guess I have lots more to say in the negatives but I'll end here, for now, and yeah the game wasn't horrible but I'll say it was mid at best, around 6/10",1687275307,1687275307,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Things I like:
-Online is very easy to earn money in, you do earn more cash for winning first place but the more people you have racing the more everyone earns so it helps balance out.
-The anime style mixed with the realism may seem weird on paper, but it actually adds a nice arcade flavor to NFS to give it that arcade racer feel that the game truly is.
-Car customization is much better than it was in NFS Heat
-Cops only chase you in Online if you hit them, don't have to worry about constantly evading police when trying to go to other events. A good balance for players who want to casually enjoy the cosmetics of cars in NFS like myself and players who take this game seriously.
-Drifting is much better in this game than it was in NFS Heat, you don't need to throw Drag tires onto a drift build to make it work.
-The Devs are actually updating this game and trying to improve it, unlike NFS. I understand the last game was not the fault of the devs but it was still kinda depressing to get an incomplete game that the only update it received was one convertible car and added crossplay.

Complaints:
-Have to restart game after a while because graphics begin to bug out
-Occasionally my controller will disconnect and my mic/audio will switch on Discord only while playing this game. (Might be an issue on my end, attempting to resolve with Powered USB Hub and a fresh reinstall of Windows)
-Story mode is awful, the forced day night system and having to earn x amount of cash plus forced to upgrade your car just makes it drag. Makes a week in the story feel like you've been in the story for a year.
-Hoodies are forced to have the hoods up, and clothing options leave much to be desired.

I do hope they add more cars, It'd be nice to see more cars from the 80s and 90s like the GC8, Evo 1st & 2nd Gen, FC RX7, R33 GTR, S13, Pulsar GTiR, EG Civic, Mk3 and Mk4 Supra, AE86, and many more.

Overall, I really recommend the game. I love just putting on my own tunes and just grinding out races to unlock cars to build in Online.",1687213386,1687213666,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The bad? there is a lot - cops feel like a chore, especially heat 5 when you have a B class car. Out with chases you can be sitting for quite some time waiting for the helicopters to finally give you opportunity to actually move without being straight back into a chase, makes getting to events difficult and sometimes impossible.

Races seem to have a rabbit - 240z driver seems to have a higher class given that he can out accelerate you almost all the time regardless if you are boosting or not although it seems random whether this happens or not, 

The restarts are limited in-case the game punts you off course, if it does it in more than 4 races (normal mode) you cant restart, you can leave the race, forfeit your entry money and have to drive back to the meetup again. Certain takeovers force a restart until they run out in my game so you cannot do the events until last in-case you need restarts elsewhere.  

The anime effects cannot be fully turned off, smoke from tyres looks ridiculous, graphics when jumping can be turned off per car, but the AI retains them and new cars you use have them.

The game is still buggy, one bug has been mentioned above but it is not the end of them. I've had my car go from 120mph to completely stopped at the top of a ramp you have to go over mid event, I've also had the same car (on the same ramp, around the same speed) punted so high I've hit a bridge above the course, that you shouldn't be able to hit regardless of speed.

The music is terrible, not sure if its bad artists, bad song choices or both, but definitely not to my taste, had to be muted. 

I bought this for £19 on sale..still regret putting that much money up for it.

Overall i'd give this game 2/5 - fun for the first few hours. If EA want a better rating then they should at least fix the bugs.

Decided to stick it out to get the achievements. I still wouldn't recommend buying it though, and definitely not for full price if you do get tempted. It does get better once you start using S and S+ rank cars, but there are still bugs in the game, still a rabbit AI in every class, and the police are a chore throughout, especially when you are trying to get to events.",1685262781,1687205514,False,3,0,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False

- The game pace is nice with the day/night cycles.  It allows a (very) casual gamer like me get some stuff accomplished and have a defined break point to put the game up for the day.  
- The cop chases are a fun add to a racing game.

Cons
- Seems like it might become a grind but don't know yet.
- No in-car camera, I'm having a little challenge adjusting to 3rd person racing, but that camera seems better than some racing games I've played.

At the start it was really fun, the mechanics were engaging, and the day-night cycles are cool, however it felt as if as time went on, it didn't get repetitive, or challenging, just more annoying than anything.
I like the new upgrade and engine swap system, but the week based events feel out of place for this game, as it adds unnecessary pressure, and doesn't allow you to comfortably invest in a new car and have it up to spec.
If the player isn't able to purchase any stock car in a timely manner, how will they be able to finish the week and enter the qualifier? They redo Friday, not the whole week.
it sounds nice, however is terrible when you don't have a car that can keep up in its class (even if the ranking system says its as best as it can get)
The ranking system was a neat touch, just executed very terribly, like how ai manage to get an S+ 400+ car in an A+ class race, at least thats what it feels like depending on the car you have.
Going back to the week system, because all cars aren't treated fairly, no matter what upgrades its given, you can't buy new cars without loosing more money than gained.
Because of that, you can unfortunately soft lock yourself if you don't have the money for the qualifier.
Since it doesn't give you the option to reset the week, I cannot change up how I approach the races, or even invest in a new car without selling my current car. (I've tried selling my car, doesn't work out in your favor very well so I wouldn't try it)
You can invest 800k in one car to get it S+, but will still get smoked by another car due to the imbalances some cars have, NFS Heat didn't have this issue, as that class system wasn't broken, didn't matter what car you were in, with enough skill you can get it up to spec.
The solution would seem simple if I don't have cash, ""just take the low risk events"" but here lies another issue, the last qualifier will give you nothing but high risk events, and you shouldn't bother with doing any other race class on the last day other than S+ unless you want to quickly get busted by the cops.
In races, the ai are less intelligent than you think, even in the hardest difficulty, and their stupidity is the reason why you would lose a lot of the races. They bump traffic, causing them to restrict the space you have, it happens near frequently to the point where you cannot recover your position unless you have the most broken car in the game, no matter how good of a driver you are you will fall back because of the ai's tenancy to have the IQ equivalent of a box, but that's an insult to boxes, as they're at least open minded.

The only other good thing i can say about this game is that the drifting is better polished, however even buying the palace edition while it was on sale, this game doesn't feel entirely worth it until they fix these crucial issues.",1687032060,1687032060,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The driving mechanics are garbage, even worse than the crew
It's kinda hard to drive a car smoothly on this game, using a gamepad or keyboard is the same. and yeah steering wheel isn't supported or maybe that's only my g923 that doesn't work on this game, idk. 
The graphics and optimization are not any better
Well the graphics quality is not really an issues, but the optimization is
it's not about the framerate in my case, it's all about the texture and graphics glitch that occured me from time to time, 
My pc meet the requirements, the temperatures are fine, the game is installed on NVME SSD, and it's running on maxed out setting smoothly except sometimes after a few hours of playing the texture begin to not rendered, going blank, or black texture
Sometime the games even occured an extreme graphicals artifatct that make the game isn't playable unless you restart the games (at first i thought my gpu is dying LOL)

The photo mode was terrible, there are only few basic things you can control on photo mode (height,zoom in, zoom out, depth of field, focal distance, contrast and saturation)
Online multiplayer races are just like any other racing games, rammer everywhere.

That's a word i can say about this game after 200+ hours on NFS HEAT(because 90% is same) and try this game.
The GOOD:
1. Is new NFS Game especially the graphic but not the cartonish effect
2. PEDESTRIAN! yeah after year, year, and year some people here 
3. We got face for the Rival enemy
4. Respwan Penalty is more quickly
5. BURST NITRO!
6. CLASS CAR like FORZA
.
The BAD:
1. Don't buy this game in full price just wait discount like event EA Publisher Sale before discount 90%.
2. Don't even try think about PALACE EDITION that's a bullsh*t DLC.
3. I already try this game on console PS5 and make me sick about the cartonish effect and there is no option in console so i want give i chance to this game on PC and try with MOD and gues what? is so much better for my eyes.
4. I know is different studio but if you make this game 90% simmiliar with the predecessor please just something more good.
5. Rivals A.I. is like have unlimited nitrous
6. COP A.I. is even funnier fast but not challenging
7. What are the benefits of getting HEAT 5 in this game? Is nothing! In HEAT you can get a spesific race to get a ultimate parts and your money will be multiplied! 
8. DAY NIGHT?? In this game is rubbish! It makes almost no difference whether you race during the day or at night the cops, the races, and any events. In HEAT? is much better!
9. NO FAST TRAVEL.
10. Grinding money in this game is rubbish. Prize from every events is to little.
11. Grip turns really do feel like a bowstring being pulled back even in my favorite car BMW M3 GTR.
12. RESTART there is an amount number to use? WTH?
13. Soundtrack, ugh is just 2-3 song i can enjoy. and none of them is memorable.
14. Enemy RIVALS is feel empty and they have some cringiest word.
15. Story even cringiest.

You don't have any cops in the multiplayer and after reaching max lvl you are done with the game. If you play a lot you are done with this in about a week.

POSITIVES
EXAGGERATED Sounds and effects, and better optimization! AMD user. (Can go ultra compared to heat, low and medium.)
whoever had the thought of adding custom gear shift sound is genius!
improvements on handling, bigger Map, etc.
Can't stop playing it! Sound design in this game is so good! I can't get enough with it.
I believe that's what NFS games does best.

As always, beautiful graphics, and beautiful cars! I love it!
I also like the low cash rewards, keeps me playing for a long time.


All of this positives comes with NEGATIVES. 
music is not good. story is not bad but not good either (too short).
mostly the same car selection as NFS Heat.

Cars sounds are somewhat hard to hear.

The map has full of potential for a lot of Race Events. Yet, there's only several of them. 
(Average of 7 per tier)

AI Cops are a lot better finding you compared to heat (I like that), but is easily swayed when you tap them and they crash frequently. Even on the highest difficulty, they're much easier than heat. In return, you get damage more. I don't get why most people are saying it's hard? please don't listen to them. Make it even harder! that's what need for speed is.

AI Racers are slow on corners but fast at straights.

I don't mind the story If the game is fun.

good to know Criterion did a lot of patches in the new update!

(changing the controller dead zone to 5% helped for me). even by the end though the handling felt unpredictable at times.
The art style and the hand drawn effects are pretty cool.
the option to rebind the buttons for controller would have been nice.
In the later game having to constantly outrun and hide from the cops gets really annoying and tedious. the heat level should definitely be tied to the car. it really doesnt make sense to keep the heat level when you switch cars.
having to lose the cops before you can start a high heat delivery, which begins with you running from the cops seems like an oversight.
The police road blocks do more damage to the other police than they do to you.
they copied a few features from forza like the community car paint designs, i personally would have prefered if they kept the old school system of unlocking designs through some kind of progression system. they also seem to have taken the free roam speed traps, drift zones etc from forza which is kinda meaningless here because they payouts are tiny and most of the fun of that feature in forza is the leaderboard where you can compare your scores with friends.
fun game though, definitely worth the price if you can get it on sale. doesnt quite fill the void of the classic NFS games but it comes close.

Pros:
A lot of cars to choose
Art style is amazing, I love the animated look of the game (not a lot of players do but its something refreshing)
Map is big enough for single-player
Story kinda fun (corny jokes)

Cons: (Oh boy theres a lot)
Racing: - not bad but its a loop of a game, point A to point B and repeat it the next day.
AI: - Easy AI tends to crash into you a lot more than heat/payback did, normal (same thing), Hard AI tends to teleport to catch up to you especially the cops. 
^Traffic AI tries to ram you when you turn 1 way or the other following your turn, and has more crash impact than a cop car.
^^Police AI is dumb ass hell. You can get away from a helicopter by hiding under a bridge, AI will try to ram you the most dumbest of ways, and its always fixed targeted on the player not other AI, they will ignore the others (You will end with 7 cops vs AI with 1 cop) Cops run off road and still come out fine just to fuck you. 
Drifting: -  requires 0 skill (like playing burnout paradise ;its made by Criterion so i guess)
Story: - is every game, main character gets backstabbed, you get payback, gg ez, end of game.
^ Characters are super annoying, nothing interesting
Car customization: -  is is lack luster. Barely anything to customize and limited wheels. 
Physics: - Holy hell its crap, you can't tell which is destructible and not, you can break multiple trees but not a bush. As well with many barriers and some will be a solid wall. Or even better fences can be destructible but behind it will not. 
Multiplayer: - dead.
Driving sucks.

1846380,139812408,76561198835976917,0,1,3918,0,920,1688186413,"Personally, I would recommend NFS Heat INSTEAD if you're looking for a NFS game. As a competitive player of many games, I can say the start of this game is not beginner friendly at all. The arcade physics can be fun, but still if you prefer an arcade racer, I would recommend Heat or Forza Horizon 5. Maybe get this game at 20 bucks. 

Besides the difficulty of the start of the game, I would recommend the devs to make the cops a bit easier to avoid at higher heat levels, and perhaps let the scale depending on the class of vehicle you're driving in, with the higher heat giving higher reward for escaping. It's not difficult to escape the cops in this game, but the problem is when you start to head towards your next event, they will re-engage and CAN spawn right in front of you suddenly. I did like OG Most Wanted's system of, cops will gravitate to you if you crash or cause accidents around you. The current cops can react to your headlights, but not your car's engine/exhaust/tire sounds... The current system with the cops doesn't make the game fun and challenging, but rather makes the game's events rotations a chore and a hassle.

There is no safehouse jumping or any sort of map jumping in the game at all, so if you want your next event, you'll have to drive the map to get there. Even Heat had safehouse jumping, and though it probably really isn't a necessary feature, I would say just tweaking the cops a bit would make the whole game more enjoyable, as well as turning the difficulty down a bit at the start, and making the game progressively harder with higher risk/reward factors. As the current game stands, it's just an awkward mesh of sometimes fun and awesome moments, dragged down by a difficult start that ironically gets far easier as you progress... The game starts slow, doesn't feel rewarding enough and just needs some tweaks imo. It's very grindy for a racing game, but I do like how it rewards planning ahead to collect all rewards. 

The game has fun new aesthetics that fit a modern arcade racer pretty well surprisingly. It has some decent fun physics and the great customization NFS is known for. Not as intricate as some of the past installments, but very stylish options and new features that carry the look and feel of the game. It's sort of an awkward installment thought to the franchise as a whole. I can't really recommend this game over NFS Heat unless maybe you get this game for about 20 bucks... 

Graphics, style, and fun driving profile/physics make the game fun, but I probably won't spend as much time on this game as I have for any of the legendary nfs installments. For me NFS Heat was the best reinstallment of the series by FAR for a looong time. For me, this game leaves the candle lit, but only for the next installment... OR some passionate tweaks/updates that would solidify this game as an incredible following line up to Heat.

At the worst I give it a 2.5/5 but at it's peak, I can see the potential of this being an actual 4.5/5. You have a GREAT formula here that has amazing potential, but it's just bogged down by too many negatives that coud probably be easily addressed with just a few updates.

Also lastly, I never did mention the great line-up of cars, but mainly because that becomes a near moot point when you see that both NFS Heat and FH5 have just as good of a line-up and competing graphics. In the end, I see this as a spoiled game, that REALLY had the POTENTIAL to be another great insatllemnt. But who knows, the game is still relatively infant, so there might be room for this to just be, in it's current state, a diamond in the rough. If that happens, I WILL actually recommend this game, but for now, the past installments are just arguably better... Deja vu, LOOKIN AT YOU Most Wanted vs Carbon... Only, I would have actually still recommended Carbon after Most Wanted, but with OG Most Wanted still being the king...",1686363041,1686363041,False,3,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

- Good arcade handaling but only if we talking not about drift mechanics in this game
- Its fun to play without subtitles, with voices of characters turning off and without ingame music that you can replace by any D&B 180 bpm or any music higher than that bpm
- Cool driving effects but its sad that not much unique one like that you getting for buying ""Palace Edition"" of the game.
- Drift modes can be ignored and dont have any cars locked behind it
- Banking bunch of money is fun and risking it all too
- Great Car visual customization but i wish ther was more of it
Cons:
- Shitty drift mechanic that forces you to rebuild your car for this gamemode or use another car for this mode specifically
- Character telling you on second week that you need 4 different type of cars but not mentioning that you need it for the final week so you coul just missunderstand like i did and farm cars and ugrade those and at the end reailze that you need it only for week 4...
- Lack of race tracks of the game and heavy reuse of those from the start of the campain till the end...
- Really bad Music choice for that game most of the time slow and not fit into the fast game like this but for some reason have: Front to Back by Buku, HEY NEIGHBOUR! by poutyface. It feels like someone forgot to cut this track from the game when someone at the top decided to change type of music for this game.
- Story and writting is shit and doesnt make any sense that at the end you literally becoming friends with the person that RUINED your BUSINESS and you was 2 working at shitty work and at the end of Final Race she just ""sorry"" for what she did and Everyone is happy...
- Cops most of the time are fine but its have really bad scaling if we talking when you have S tier car and its just really easy to get out from them and if you only intentionally hit the wall you could looose all money you banking.
- That one custom mode where you getting points by hitting barrels ect... Just dont get it why they decided to add it its easy to abuse but at the same time boring and frustrating sometimes when game forcing you to play this mode to get fancy car you could use in future (or not)

At the end if you want to have FUN in this game just disable characters voice, music so you can use your own music instead and have REAL FUN playing this game and getting adrenalin from chlenging enemies and enjoy driving mechanics if we speaking about not drift and another custom mode so you have solid 30 hours riding cars, running from cops when having high stakes

Best NFS in years, the game is awesome! 
Really liked the visual style and the style of the game in general! Very fresh, unusual, and interesting! Plot is a little simple, but the racing is great! Awesome race mechanics, finally you get the money not just for the wins. At the beginning it's very hard to play and it's cool, you really feel like a poor sucker on a bucket and there's an incentive to make money and buy fancy cars. But when you get a car S + class, then the heat begins! Great to feel the speed and drive of racing! Very glad that there are again difficult and varied police cars! With them difficult (at times) and very interesting! 
Finally, the game is top, highly recommended!

Short review:
Pros:
- graphics, and visuals
- large fleet of cars
- Nice underground style.
- A variety of tracks and races. Huge and interesting map
- Cool and challenging cops! Racing with them is really very cool

Cons:
- Arcade elements like bears and stuff, annoying.",1686339237,1686339237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I honestly don’t remember when I last enjoyed an NFS title. I grew up playing (amongst many other things) Hot Pursuit 2, Underground 2, Most Wanted and my all-time favourite racing game – Carbon. The last NFS titles I bought were Undercover and Hot Pursuit 2010, which were also solid. The thrill and excitement of driving dangerously while street racing is something, which we won’t find outside NFS. And I’m glad to say I did indeed have fun playing Unbound… [b]for the first few hours.[/b] Soon after, the more I played – the more I find my experience tedious and in some cases infuriating.

Let’s start with the positives. I suppose most of you have already seen the numerous videos shitting on the OST. I can say those videos are completely taken out of context by selecting only certain parts of songs and only the 6-7 truly terrible songs – out of 72! [b]Huge amount of the songs are bangers with a wide variety of lesser-known Western and Eastern European artists.[/b] The controls are good enough, but not as good as some of the older games. I like the changes to race rewards. Unlike other racing games, finishing first is not the only way to be rewarded or continue the story. The main goal is to earn a certain amount of money to continue with the story. You will lose money for placing poorly but good positions are always rewarded well. It never bogs down to repetitive perfectionism and keeps moving. The car customization system is also decent. There are plenty of options to individualize your ride. Moreover, they finally added the option to share your wraps with the community.

Now for the negatives. [b]Unbound will test your tolerance for bullshit.[/b] The crash system is atrocious and it can easily ruin any enjoyment. Crash cams arrest control for several seconds and completely wreck the momentum of the race while the crash detections feel… unfinished. Sometimes trading paint will ruin your chances of placing in a good position, but a head-on collision can barely change your health bar. Most of the time crashes have zero physical sense. Moreover, the difficulty in Unbound feels very cheap and artificial. A.I. drivers with low scores somehow manage to dominate without you even having a chance of beating them. You can drive perfectly without making even a single mistake but an A.I. driver can still take the first spot with more than 250-300 meters lead. On top of that, you get a limited amount of restarts for the day and night (the story progress into days of the week and each day is divided into day racing and night racing). There is no fast travel so you have to drive to different events. Which wouldn’t be a problem if the police system was good. They are pests added to extend the game, nothing more. The map is also very bland with nothing distinctively interesting in it. You also can’t drive in a straight line through hills or shortcuts because of the absurdities of the destructible objects. The distinction is unclear between things that will evaporate on contact and things that will break you. The cherry on top for me personally is all the clutter that is on the screen. The tracks do look very detailed but having so many objects and effects on the screen makes it very hard to focus on the race and it was the main reason for all the frustration I had while playing Unbound. I’m personally not against the anime-like effects, a lot of effort was put into them but combined with everything else they feel unnecessary and too distracting.

Of course, it wouldn’t be published by EA if there were no bullshit “DLCs”. Most of them are cosmetics but what made me laugh out loud was the “DLC” for 5€ which marks all the [b]collectables (260!!!)[/b] and [b]activities (190!!!).[/b] I will be honest – I bought it, installed a fast travel mod, got all the missing collectables, finished the missing activities and refunded it.

In conclusion, I find it very hard to recommend NFS Unbound. I bought the EA Racing Bundle on sale for ~20€ just because I wanted to get Hot Pursuit Remastered (which costs around the same price). It [b]can[/b] be a good racing game, but it’s fundamentally flawed. It can be a better experience with some mods but it’s still a far cry from the golden Black Box era.

If you ever feel the need to be a felon and engage police in a high speed pursuit, then the single player mode is for you. You'll spend 10% racing and 90% in pursuits:

- T1 patrol cars will occasionally spawn directly on your location if you have high heat
- Police will do everything in their power to make sure you end up last in your race
- Police will spawn near and patrol your intended path if you're using the GPS
- In my case, I always spawn in the same spot in Apolonia District if I quit the game and load back in without banking in the current session using the safehouses. It is a pain to get to faraway meetup spots with max heat without getting into pursuits

In multiplayer, unless you are playing with friends, expect every race to be a bumper car fiesta.

The animated styling of certain aspects of the game doesn't really blend in well with the rest of the game. But you will get used to it over time.

The game is created to force you to grind. If you are good at it, the story is very short. Otherwise, it's artificial game-time increase.

Ai is terrible with both police and racers basically playing bumper cars with traffic. also gravity seems to be set at 75% Earth gravity. If you want to get money fast, go for drift races- they will never be able to make the turns without crashing.

Music is garbage. Some songs have novelty value but get annoying after a few days.

I had around 50 hours in NFS Heat, by no means a hardcore NFS player or anything. But this just feels like a worse version of Heat. There are cop chases constantly (and its not hard to get away, just miserable to be in a chase after EVERY SINGLE RACE). 

In heat, you could get in a cop chase during day, but it was whatever. And you would sometimes see one during a race. In Unbound, you will be in a cop chase 99% of the time, and instead of being able to just outrun it immediately like you would in Heat (because the cops locations carried over into open world) it will spawn you into open world with a cop 5 ft from your bumper. And you have to runaway even if the cop was NOWHERE near you in the race. 

Oh and BTW, your heat from the day races will also carry over to night. And since you are being chased constantly, itll start around heat 2 each time. And, at least in the early game, you will struggle to attend any races since cops will be everywhere. The first race might be easy to get to, but then your heat is immediately at 3 and youre just fucked. You'll spend 30 minutes just doing 2 or 3 races due to all the cop interruptions.

The game is fine. Just 'fine,' there isn't much of anything new except the city and, like, the Nissan Z and you kind of just expect more from 3 years and $70 later.
The story is eh, pretty boring and uninteresting. You lose your beginning car and have to work you way back up to the top get it back, except I wasn't attached to that car so I kind of just don't care. They pulled the Ubisoft move where you loose something that you are supposed to be really attached to except there wasn't enough screen time or effort to make you care about the car at all. 

Handling of the cars feels great though. Like it actually feels different between cars. 
Also you can't actually turn the effects off. Cloaked is good enough for me but there is no 'none' option like i was lead to believe. Not a deal breaker but thought I should mention it. 

Things I'd like to see changed is the heat system, you build heat too fast to the point where you're already heat 5 when you start the night and get into a cop chase immediately after leaving the garage. It spawns so many cops, like 5 all on the same road and the helicopters know where you are at all times and just hang around until you move from under cover to start a chase. Also at heat 5 there's no legit way to lose the cops, especially early game, you basically have to resort to cheesing them with the L tracks. Some tweaks to make them less annoying and frustrating I think would be good. Return of pursuit breakers maybe?
There doesn't seem to be many races either. I feel like I've done the same 6 races over and over, like that is all that's in the game. I'm sure more will become available later but it seems to be the same ones in the online portion so I'm not sure, I'm only on week 2 though.

What needs the most work is the online. Separate progression and no bots means, unless you have a friend to play with, you're SOL on unlocking anything new because no one will join your race. And it locks so many cars behind 'complete X amount of races' challenges. Also they're multi-race playlists so it feels really grindy when you do the same races over and over. No cops doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would, they're annoying enough in single player. I think they need added but implemented right so you're not getting in a pursuit every 1-3 minutes like in SP. 

TLDR: buy it on sale and/or after some updates. Hopefully it will have content updates and more post launch support this time around.",1670639533,1686015258,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TBH I only picked Unbound up because it was massively discounted, & I wanted more after replaying Heat.

The mix of the realistic cars & world with the cartoonish characters & car effects takes some getting used to. I thought it would make the game unplayable for me when I first saw a friend playing the game, but I quickly forgot about it.
The bystanders however never should have been added to the game. It often seems like you'd be running them over as they dodge the wrong way at times. And when you're going over 300km/h, they either don't react or do so after you're gone (I didn't turn around to check).

The collisions in this game are totally obnoxious. Hitting any civilian, even going as slow as 60 km/h, will cause your car to flip in the air triggering a crash cam. The same can happen with wall collisions, but this is totally random with the angle you hit them at. However, going into a head-on collision with certain cops is the best way to deal with them & more often then not, your car will just stick to the road, barely veering off track or taking any damage.
Any collision in a race will therefore usually lose you said race, as your rivals will have flawless driving & barely ever hit any traffic (true for the 2 harder difficulties I both tried, I never swapped to the lowest one). This is also made even worse as your rivals will nudge civilians off track, leading to unexpected behavior as their AI breaks. Cops will also hit civilians, which shouldn't ever happen in any given universe.

The car ranking system is garbage. Depending on their ranking, cars are ranked B, A, A+, S or S+. The problem is you can only ever use a car of the correct rank for a given event & all cars are not equal at similar ratings. This led to me being unable to upgrade my starter car, despite having the cash & upgrades unlocked. And still being unable to win against some rivals even with a perfect race. So I had to build up a different car with higher specs, which is expensive as you cannot move parts between vehicles (as was the case in Heat), you must buy everything again.
Later I swapped out the engine to upgrade another car to S+. that just turned my perfect car into a wobbly mess that couldn't hold a straight line, let alone win races. After that 400k$ upgrade & some others spent trying to correct it, saving up to afford an actual S+ car was a very unfun grind. 

This is probably the NFS game with the lowest map pool of any I have ever played. The solo campaign takes place over 4 weeks monday-friday day & night, with a special event on saturday. Each cycle has 3-7 events for your highest car rank, but they are repeated over the course of the campaign. Some of them are never worth it for the reward & heat they incur. And going back to the available lower ranked races for the sake of a payout just feels grindy & uninteresting.
This is all made even worse when you cannot afford the buy-in for the saturday event & pick the ""Repeat Friday"" option. Your new friday will indeed have the exact same races as the previous day. Repeating the same 3-4 events 5 times so I could afford a car that could actually compete is probably something that I could have avoided. Yet having completed 6 other NFS titles, I still wound up there & those wer probably the lamest hours I've spent on any NFS title.


On a positive note, the delivery missions that let you try out a variety of different cars were highly enjoyable (if you forget 3-4 vehicles I would have ditched if not for the payout).
It is also a nice change of pace going for the collectables & activities, but doing so between races is obnoxious as your heat will trigger cop chases all the time. I have yet to decide whether I feel like going back to get those I missed & I will probably get tired of it before i finish the 100% anyway...


All in all, not a total trainwreck.
Pick it up on a discount, if you're a NFS fan. Might as well give it a shot & make your own idea on it if you want something new.
However, if you are new t the NFS franchise, go for NFS Heat instead.",1685779666,1685779666,False,1,0,0.508982002735137939,0,True,False,False

Already since the start I was greeted by something like ""my computer was potato and performance might be hindered"" but I played it anyways (for I certainly cannot refund it now) and I must say this is by far feels like the smoothest NFS I tried so far. Sure, like everyone else I was on the edge over the cell shading art(let's not called it Anime to avoid confusion). I am scared it will even add more distraction during the neck breaking fast of the racing game itself but it turned out to be subtle. You won't feel bothered by it, if anything you will wish there will be more customization about it. 
The last good NFS game for me was the NFS Heat. Really enjoyed that game. But if I have better computer to play this game I would certainly without any doubt confirm that this is the best NFS so far. Hell, it is still the best NFS so far for me despite my computer limitation. 
Of course the game play is a bit different than lets say with Heat. The first few hours will be the hardest. It feels more like rogue lite racing game that the usual NFS. But that is what I think gave this game the new perspective to play NFS. 
I might not really enjoyed the scheduled day and night cycle as opposed to NFS Heat where you can choose freely between day or night, this NFS gave you tight schedule to achieve and compete (of course it's not the end of the world though if you can't achieve that schedule. spoiler alert) but I am thinking more like a open world racing game with some limitation. And the limitation is sometimes could be annoying. Either way if you don't care about story and only want to race, it is still an acceptable open world. 
I feel like this NFS somehow very stingy with money distribution and buying new car and upgrading them might take a while. Sure i am still considerable early in the game, but this is the most grind i felt in the NFS series. Not that i mind grinding though. 
Anyway, I like it, I heard the multiplayer still sucks but I am not really into multiplayer anyway. If you are though, you might want to wait a while and check around. 
I probably will finish this game and change to Forza Horizon but in the meantime, I don't feel regret purchasing this (...on discount. full disclosure). 
If you are already long time fan of NFS but still haven't pull trigger on this one then I would recommend getting this one way or another. It can't be the worst NFS and like I said earlier, it could be the best.

My major complaint is about the race system, it doesn't even let you customize a car above the highest available race tier. If you maximize the performance of a car for the race level you want to play, even on ""easy"" difficulty you will struggle to get 1st, forcing you to waste too much time on perfectly and precisely tune your car.
Beside from that, how tf you can make a race game with a limited numbers or restart PER SESSION even in single player mode and even in easy difficulty? Fkn stupid 

Tess character is cringe af, she behave like a 12 yo kid, the one with ADHD.

The style and aestethic of the game revolve around the ""trap"" culture, the more stupid and poser parts. The soundtrack reflects this aspect, after the first track you hear in the game you will want to pierce your hears with a rusty screwdriver.

Also (more of a personal taste), if the whole game is based on street races, why tf there are prizes even for 2nd to 6th place?

Fun to collect and customize cars, especially my beloved Eclipse that destroys hypercars on the reg. Absolutely worth the sale price for some arcade racing fun. I hardly care how unbalanced and broken it is anymore. Beware '76 GTI users lol.

cops still way too easy but whatevs.

OLD REVIEW FOR STORY (38hrs in): cop AI needs a massive overhaul. for how much you get chased, it almost never actually feels like a threat, and more just really annoying. so easy to get them to hit traffic, or otherwise ram them. i still havent even come close to getting busted, and wont even notice heat level because it's all so easy. 

rubber-banding is also a huge issue, both with the cops and in races. the biggest problem overall is inconsistency, as sometimes AI pulls wayyyyy ahead, and other times it seems more fair, or the racers crash out a lot, letting you win.

i found myself just wanting the story to be over with so i can play something else, not taking my time and enjoying it like older games. i'm already bored with it, especially with the map, and the cringey af dialogue. who is this for lmao? 

the cars look pretty cool, and there's certainly a lot of them. that's neat ig. i also like some of the progressiveness with character creation, with blurring of gender lines, but that's how it should have always been.

It’s a driving game FFS… I mean you'd think having every single character be cringe it’s bad enough, but noooo... they put a transgender as one of the best drivers, with that annoying fake voice (meaning that if you wanna bet money against them, to win as much as possible, you need to listen to their dialogue for the entire race). AND THEN, get this...you have a mission to taxi a black chick somewhere because she’s being chased by cops and my character asks “why are the cops chasing you? going to fast?” and she literally says, word for word… ”nah, it was racial profiling!”. So, the cops didn’t chase her because she’s an ILLEGAL STREET RACER…no no no, it’s because of her skin colour, OBVIOUSLY. What an absolute joke…but that’s what you get when you hire a social studies “writer”. Disgusting. I mean the moral of the story they’re trying to push on you is that politicians are bad…and somehow street racers aren’t…?!...Man o man…

Listen, the gameplay is ok, if you like Mario kart. I mean it! You can take corners with drifting, just as fast as someone taking the “racing path” (the most efficient way). This game has nothing to do with reality or driving an actual car. But that’s ok…I don’t need a racing sim; I just wanted a mindless driving game. And on that front, it delivers quite well. The car sounds, effects and the driving and smashing through 90% of anything on the road is fun most times. Also, by far the best thing in the game is the way the Nitro system works, having 2 types of NOS, one from driving well and doing cool stuff and one that builds slowly from driving on the opposite lane, quite smart. Having said that, the massive cringe in the dialogue plus the absolutely broken AI just slaps you across the face, again and again, so game just ends up being this roller-coaster of good vs bad design. Even if you just mute the trash dialogue, it would still be mediocre AF in the end. 

The AI on normal and above just craps on you, unless you just run them of the road. The police have massive 4x4 trucks that go head-to-head with your 300 km/h, tuned, beast of a car and they seemingly just appear out of nowhere (just teleport) whenever one of them spots you on the road, it’s so dumb and annoying (not to mention that they gave garbage dialogue to the police as well). 

Oh and the soundtrack is godawful... Like really really bad. 

Yeah, even at a massive discount I still regret my purchase. Tuning the cars and making them look cool never gets old…that’s why it’s so shocking that these idiots just never seem to be able to recreate the massive hit that was NFS Underground, or some of the older ones, like Porsche and High Stakes. NFS nowadays is just miss after miss and this one is could be ok, but because of the cringe I say… hard pass.",1685514895,1685714882,False,3,1,0.513184607028961182,0,True,False,False

So first a good things (or upgrades):
-longer plot of game than in heat
-police now can chase you in day. Overall makes lots more sense than in heat and adds some kind of strategy in your gameplay, because the ""heat level"" doesn't reset when you return to your garage, and you have to take part in day stage in game, then night and only if you come back to garage, heat resets.
now mediocre or neutral things:
-colaboration with ASAP Rocky. Like he should stay making mediocre music, than raceing like shit. I mean that his final 1v1 is too eazy, and he is a lot harder in normal racers. In game there is like 1 cutscene with him. But thats nice that we have some kind of interview with him in credits at the end and in one mission
-remakeing cops. I can't describe it. Like they have harder time finding you, wich is good and they are a lot less annoing, but I feel like they are to easy. I mean in heat I was fear about cops, but now they feel, ironically, more annoing, because I wasn't ever caught by them even once. Maybe they would be better if EA could fix roadblock and spikes. They really often spawn in completly other road so player never acually runs in those.
-art style. It was annoing only once, when there was a picture of some porsche (I'm not a car guy) but it has, typical to this art style, some green lines on it, drawn by some art designer and i just imagined some guy going to work, opening up the computer, opening ""paint"" and drawing some lines like some kid in kindergarden...
-driveing. It isn't hard, you just have to accustom to it.
-Plot.
And now the cherry at the top, bad things:
-no cutscenes. You can literally count them on fingers of 1 hand
-basically same opponents. They change a little bit, but they could change every oponent, after qualifications, because they lost. That could add some fresh to gameplay.
-sound track. So the story goes like that - I was super hyped to finaly play playback at 2021/2022 (I don't remember exacly but it doesn't change anything) and I was shock how good that game is (exept for offroad raceing, because of randomnes). After some time I played heat    and I was shock how bad it is.                 It was like playing payback but without good lore (for nfs games), haveing shity soundtrack, and being like really long 13h (thats how long took me to end plot without side missions) of grinding. Later I want to play unbound but being overlaps with bad revievs, I decided not to. After some time I saw another reviev, that spoke, to try this game for yourself, because the revievs are mix. So I bought it in the closes pricedrop and I had zero expectations and I was like, this game wasn't that bad. I even dont hate the soundtrack (probably because I like music that I have some memories with it), but today i heard a lot of good revievs of nfs heat and a lot of memes about soundtrack in nfs unbound. I was like ""nooo, soundtrack in unbound is definitely better than in heat. So I open up spotify and compare them and now I think nfs unbound soundtrack is trash, and this story is why i writen this reviev...
At the end, its only my opinion, so you, as I, should try buing this game for like 20/30 bucks, definitely not for the orginal price, knowing that it isn't better game than nfs heat and only if you played every other nfs for ""new trilogy"" (nfs heat, but first you should play nfs payback), and you still want somefing new.

This is a GREAT GAME FOR KIDS. For adults, not so much. I held off on this review since it released incomplete, so I waited till they at least added cops to online and when I got a chance to plane, what a let down that was. Below are my squabbles with this game many of which why I believe it makes a great children's game, but a bad adult game.

*The cops are pathetically dumb, the cops online are useless, may as well just be decoration. For a kid it'd feel amazing.

*The modding is simplified for the children, and just feels like no thought needs to go into it for adults. 

*9 times out of 10 you'll be in a race with 1-3 others, and finish the playlist solo or with 1 people (including you). This can boost self esteem of a child ""oh I made them quit cause they know they have no chance"", for an adult its ""Oh, they just figure they'll go do something else to make money since this playlist isn't full""

*The is a report system, and if mass reported even when you didn't actually do anything you will get auto suspended, followed by a 3 day email chain with support for them to eventually unsuspend you 3 days before your 7 day suspension is up.

*Really boring for a solo player. As a kid, you likely have school friends, but adults are much less social these days given the stresses they're under so this is less of an issue for them.

*The physics are kinda cartoony... I've had a car come to stop like it hit brick wall for 0 reason, I've had a car fly over 1/5th of the map, I've had a car flip for 0 reason.... For a kid this is likely a charming part of a racing game.",1685650902,1685651493,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Note about the game: [/h1]

Need for Speed Unbound is a game developed by Criterion and Codemasters and published by EA for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC on December 2nd, 2022 or November 29th, 2022 if you pre-ordered Palace Edition.

[h1] Positives: [/h1]
The customization is almost unmatched, even allowing you to remove car body parts off of a car.
The graphics look great, even on low settings. (which is what I played with)
There is full controller and wheel support for Logitech, Thrustmaster and more wheels, and also supports Xbox/PS controllers, even allowing you to play on an Xbox One controller, since the button layout is practically the same.
The map is large enough for our needs. Sure, it's not as big compared to the likes of Forza Horizon, but it's more than enough for cruising with your friends.
The effects are pretty cool, and even though some people don't really like it and would rather get the normal smoke effect, I still find it cool and also looks like it came out of a graffiti art wall.

[h1] Negatives: [/h1]
The soundtrack is probably the worst one out of any NFS game to this day. I am aware that some people may like the OST, but for me, it's just cringe after cringe. There are one or two songs that are actually decent, maybe even good, like the freeroam music, but in my opinion, the soundtrack is just... awful.
Just like any other EA game, it requires an EA launcher to play this game. I don't really mind this to be fair, but it just requires another step to actually play the game you paid for.
The story is just... cringe, in my opinion. I would rather not get deep into it, but in short, it's cringe. Very cringe.
The photo mode is limited compared to NFS Heat, as it completely removed some features, like tilting the camera, as you can only zoom in and out.
The multiplayer in this game is a little bit of a mess. When I played the multiplayer mode, I had just started, and people are already in S class, and I just could not find B class lobbies. Some people say this might be a skill issue, and I do technically agree.

Overall, I would recommend this game, if it's on sale. Otherwise, might not be worth it. If you are a NFS fanatic (like me), then yes, it is worth 70 euro/USD for this game. I would rate it 7/10, recommended.",1685461817,1685461863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I purchased it every time a new version come out. I always thought that the new version could never look better than the previous version and I was always proven wrong. All versions had their pros and cons. My favorite part of NFS was how great each version made the cars, graphics, scenery and physics look better and better. I didn’t care how good or bad the story was, because it was before or after the race/chase. The story (if I wasn’t interested) was the perfect time to get a snack. I can honestly say I had fun playing all of them.
This current version (NFS Unbound) is the first and only version of the NEED FOR SPEED franchise, that I can say that I am completely disappointed in. It looks like you went out of your way to mess with the graphics in a big way. The goofy comic book/tattoo art is distracting and ugly. The worst part is you can’t turn it off. I understand you wanted to add something new and swanky that would bring in more fans. I however, am not one of them. I have been waiting for a patch to come out to get rid of it.

So first off about style and enjoyment. It is definitely there. I enjoyed playing the game. The customization was sweet. The cars are great. However you can find a million reviews like that on youtube and down here. I just want to put my 2 cents down on the bad. 

[list]
    [*]AI racers. They are either incompetent or get access to the plot engine of needing a tough enemy to race against. If you don't META choose your cars. You need to lower that difficulty or hypertune it. And let's just say that money is definitely a problem.
    [*]Cops. From the HEAT system that makes the races 25% management gameplay to make sure you will not have your behind clapped during the night races up to the fact that you can get rid of the cops as skillfully as you want. They will have that Helo on you like a vulture. and you will need to sit under a bridge for 15 minutes because the second helo will hover over you after the first one runs out of fuel. And did I say that the bastard never spotted me? They always know where you are. There is no gameplay involved anymore. Just run. Flee. Cops will come.
    [*]Will admit that I like the toughness and fight against the police, as well as their undercover cars are actually undercover. However the perma tracking even if I'm just doing a photoshoot is complete BS
[*] Music. I know I am considered an old fart for playing 2005 MW. But that was music. Carbon had music. Pro Street had music. Undercover had music. This is nothing less than torture in the playlist. What diversity quota BS chose these?
[*] Tracks. Simple. You have so much opportunity. And you stay with the same 10 races through the entire game. I am surprised how creatively dead the parkours are except like 2 of em.
[/list]

Now the next part is about the story. It had potential. So much god damn potential. Like I was actually excited with the premise. And it not only went downhill. It followed the Polestar 1 down the bridge of HEAT. It would be a mercy if the writer was removed from any further jobs in the field. I assume another Diversity quota result.
Spoilers in the Spoilers [duh]
[spoiler]
So we start [i]learning[/i] the game. Your first car, made with a friend. you race, she is your wingman, breaking the silence. not a bad thing. You earn your way to upgrade that beauty. Slick new bodykit. It feels perfect.....
And when she gets calls from a guy called Alek, that has jobs for us... Well, you already start feeling something is off. You are not sure but damn this feeling is strong.
Your wingman, your friend, helps that guy to steal all the god damn cars of your adopted father's garage. Leaving him on the floor, almost run over and basically almost losing his business. and she stares at him trying to lie that she didnt know. Only to be seen through instantly and driving off with your sweet ride.
A bit longer thanks to the open world driving but a nice set up for a revenge story of getting your car back.
Yeah if only.
so after 2 years you somehow find yourself in a race meet as an Uber. only to see your long disappeared friend with your car throwing down a tournament with Heats basically. Which has the aforementioned problems. So long story short and a couple of weeks of frustratingly deliveries with self proclaimed witty characters everyone hates. Except Rydell, he is a dad joke machine but he cool.
You finally get that cutscene you were hoping for. Your sponsor that suddenly acted distant and was there for the betting money. Tries to fix the race between you and the traitor. Great it can go both ways. The traitor betrays Alek group and realizes her mistake and we fight against this final boss. OR We race it out one final time without tricks.

She still freakin believes in Alek and apparently DURING THE FINAL RACE she decided that she was dumb because racing is fun. Great. You win. Get your car back without any problem. you get the money without any problem. And that B* shows up at the garage, doesnt even properly say sorry for ruining your lives and all characters on screen start laughing and we are all friends.
To quote Vegeta from DBZA of Teamfourstar.
""You ruined it. You ruined it and now I'm leaving.""
I closed the game and just could not get myself to open it.
[/spoiler]
Just like I thought HEAT rushed the ending too much, Unbound feels like a Feelgood story with diversity quota's in the development. And all I got was headache and disappointment.

They didn't. It's been 6 months and all we've gotten is one small content update that did the bare minimum to pretend that they care.


Original Review:

The moment to moment gameplay of driving in this game is nearly flawless and infinitely fun. The game is extremely polished and it shows.

However, the game has a few pretty huge issues that make it far below what it could be.

1. The story itself is meh. It would have been alright if they actually put effort into the mid-game, but after the intro you get pretty much no ""story progression"" other than one short cinematic every few hours to remind you that there's supposed to be a story. 

The voice acting/writing also... uh... how do i say this... Feels like it's adapted for 5 year olds while still being for adults.

When I finished the story, I literally said out loud: ""Seriously, that's it?""


2. The cops. The first couple heat levels are fine, but once it gets to heat 5 there's a couple core issues. The cops basically pose no threat at any point. At most you'll have 2 cops actively engaging with you, and they rarely try to box you in or side-swipe you. I beat the entire game on the ""normal"" difficulty without getting busted a single time.

Once you do escape, the game spawns every nearby area with tons of cops and gives them massive view distances that often let them see through walls, which can make it infuriating to simply get to a place on the map.


3. The multiplayer. It's basically the minimum definition of multiplayer. No organized speedlists, no cops, no real reason to progress, no way to communicate with other players at all. This is one of the things that's confirmed to improve so I'm hopeful for it.


Overall, is it worth $70? I'd honestly say no unless you're financially stable and want to play NFS, get it on sale if possible. NFS Heat is also (probably) cheaper and a great game. But if you can, I still had a blast with this game.

I have returned to the game yesterday to finish the story. I fired it up and... EA Play starts to install. This was never necessary at launch. Why is this garbage required now?
So now I had to go through your dumb EA logins, EA one time passwords, and finally I got to play MY GAME that I played WITHOUT your useless EA Play before. And EA Play needed to Update some crap which took 5 minutes.
Also, the game loads a lot longer than it used to now. What have you done to it?!

I just turned my PC on and guess what. EA Play popped up right after I logged into my computer. Why is this pile of garbage enabled on Windows startup?!

Its numerous flaws and design choices make it an incredibly frustrating and lackluster experience for both longtime fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. First and foremost, the game suffers from a lack of innovation and originality. It feels like a rehashed version of previous Need for Speed titles, bringing nothing new to the table in terms of gameplay mechanics or features. The racing itself is mundane and repetitive, with limited track variety and uninspired challenges. The handling of the vehicles is clunky and unresponsive, making it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the driving experience.

Furthermore, the game's narrative and characters are incredibly shallow and forgettable. The storyline attempts to inject a sense of drama and intrigue, but it falls flat due to poorly written dialogue and uninteresting plot twists. The characters lack depth and fail to evoke any emotional connection, making it difficult to care about their motivations or progress through the game's campaign.

Another glaring issue with Need for Speed: Unbound is its subpar graphics and lackluster visual presentation. The environments are dull and lifeless, lacking the vibrant and immersive atmosphere that racing games should strive to create. The textures are often low-resolution and lack detail, resulting in a visually unappealing experience. Additionally, the game suffers from frequent frame rate drops and technical glitches, further diminishing the overall quality of the visuals.
[18:32]
Furthermore, the game's progression system is heavily tied to microtransactions, which severely hampers the sense of accomplishment and fairness. Players are constantly bombarded with opportunities to spend real money on in-game currency and upgrades, creating an imbalanced playing field and devaluing the skill and effort required to succeed in the game. This blatant focus on monetization undermines the integrity of the gameplay and alienates players who are looking for a fair and rewarding experience.

Lastly, the multiplayer component of Need for Speed: Unbound is riddled with issues and lacks the depth and excitement that players expect from a competitive racing game. The matchmaking is inconsistent and often pairs players with opponents of vastly different skill levels, leading to frustratingly one-sided races. The online infrastructure is unreliable, with frequent disconnections and lag issues, further exacerbating the frustration of players attempting to engage in multiplayer races.

In conclusion, Need for Speed: Unbound is a prime example of a poorly executed racing game that fails to deliver on multiple fronts. Its lack of innovation, shallow narrative, subpar graphics, focus on microtransactions, and flawed multiplayer experience all contribute to its status as a disappointing and ultimately trash game. Fans of the racing genre are better off looking elsewhere for a more satisfying and enjoyable gaming experience.",1685215086,1685215086,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Cops are now in Multiplayer, and you even get an ""Assist"" bonus when helping other players lose cops. I enjoyed this.

- Payouts have been bumped, but they're still a little stingy with the rewards. Still a grind, but not as miserable as it used to be. 

- New perks for cop chases online, such as Jammer and Getaway Driver make it to where you can build copbait cars again. 10/10, loved this update. 

- For the first time in an NFS entry, you can now see how many players in a lobby are in a race or in a Garage. This is a HUGE improvement as it lets you know where all the players are, in case you find yourself in a ghost lobby by chance. Much needed IMO.

ORIGINAL REVIEW/NEGATIVES

I'm comparing this to the previous NFS entry, which is Heat. If you haven't played Heat, give it a shot over this game. Now, let's go over the Pros and Cons.

- Single Player/Story Mode is better than Heat. It's a grind, especially after the first ""Week"" of gameplay, but I found it relatively enjoyable. 

- The dialogue from characters is *much better* than Heat. Still a little cringy, but I'm an old fart so maybe I'm just not hip with the times. 

- Car customization went wild in this entry, and my single player cars represent that (more on this later). 

- Multiplayer ""Free Roam"" isn't too bad, but it could be better if more than 16 players per lobby could join. After how empty some of the sessions were in Heat, I'm surprised they didn't up this number. Regardless, it's fun to cruise with random players. 

- The cops in Heat were difficult, especially with rubber-banding, but Unbound gives a more forgiving approach to pursuits. The difficulty can be changed to give more (or less) durability to your vehicles, and I found that pretty fun. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Middle Ground:
- This isn't really a Pro or Con, but I miss being able to build vehicles for certain specs. Sure, you got ""Drift"" and ""Off-Road"", but the lack of tire/suspension options makes performance crafting really cut-and-dry. Some of my favorite vehicles in Heat have a mix of ""Showcase"" and ""Rally"" parts for that perfect handling setup. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Cons:
- Multiplayer is a separate (and even worse) grind from single player. This was, in my opinion, the worst decision NFS has made in years. In Heat, you could win some races (alone or with friends) and save up enough for a new car, engine swap, etc. In Unbound? Good luck. The ""playlist"" consist of three races, most of which are tedious. You're given one car at the start of your ""Multiplayer"" career, and cars you win in pink slip races in Single player transfer over, but that's it. No cash, no other vehicles. 

- Multiplayer is a massive *grind*. It's that bad. Upon completion of a ""playlist"", you're given maybe $30k for the higher performance class races. The old oval track race on Heat paid out roughly $50k per four lap race, but Unbound is extremely stingy with payouts. With parts for higher performance class vehicles ranging around $40k+ per part, it becomes a near unplayable grind just to try and hang with other racers. The stock cars given to you during these races (in case you don't have a car in that class) are just downright terrible. 

- No cops in Multiplayer. In Heat, I had certain vehicles built up as tanks to help other players lose cops and make it back to safe houses so they could bank their ""Heat"". No such thing in Multiplayer. Some may see this as a ""Pro"", but it's a missed feature in my book. 

- Glitches/Mods? I'm not sure how to classify this, but bringing a ""B"" class (the lowest performance class in the game) Ferrari 488 Pista to a race along with a couple of other high class vehicles ruins the Multiplayer experience. 

- Gameplay glitches, such as the map not loading correctly or low poly models/textures. I've got what would be considered a ""decent"" rig, and it blows the ""Recommended Spec"" out of the water. With the game running on an SSD, I'm hard-pressed to believe this is a ""me"" issue. 

- Cartoon-y effects. I wasn't planning on knocking points off from Unbound for this, as I heard we'd be able to turn these effects off in game, but so far nothing of the sort is available (from what I could find). I don't mind the digital-ish characters, but the gameplay/driving effects are a bit much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, I'm disappointed with this entry. Single Player doesn't really offer much replayability, but I haven't found an ""enjoyable"" Single Player story since NFS 2015 (unless you count NFS Hot Pursuit Remastered). The game, in it's current state, is NOT worth $70, and the $10 upgrade to Palace Edition isn't really worth it either considering you still have to grind to access those in Multiplayer too. 

If you're buying the game for a Single Player experience, wait until it's on sale. 

If you're buying the game for a Multiplayer/Game with Friends experience, I'd think twice (unless you enjoy a miserable grind).",1672179634,1685209209,True,0,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Max price that this game deserve is 30$.

Pros;
+Car Body kits 
+Eclipse, Bugatti, Maybach
+Nice graphics, almost realisitc in some parts of the city in daytime
+Sounds of the engine and turbo
+Traffic
+Full controller support and if you play with wheel the experience is even better bcs you can play more grip style.

Cons;
-No first person cam
-Cartoon effects
-Cartoon Characters
-Dialogs
-Story is too short and repetitive
-Music

About the cartoon effects I know from the start and i manage to live with them but, this is the first game that I muted the music and the dialogs...
Music is pure trash, one ore two songs are good but the rest are pure trash..
The dialgos sounds like some kids who need to go outside and need permision for that... Pure cringe.

I know the heat was not the best one, but at least it had a decent story, decent soundtrack and more cutscenes, that world feelt more alive, this one is just some Fast and Furious Anime edition without space and robery.

For 25$ that I paid for this is ok, I can t complain, but for 70$-80$ this game is a big NO.
Buy it if is on -70% or -80% off. Is a good game for 20$

In my opinion, if this game had a turn on/off for effects, player can make a self radio, player chose time of the day and the story had more cutscenes and more mature dialogs was good. But this are only my preferences.",1685205066,1685205066,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Leave my country.
2. Get into the US and become a cop in Redwood City, California.
3. Every time the game designers get into their car to go to office, ram into their car (this is what their game does), Rob them of all money, so that they do not have enough money to fuel their car and so, they cant reach their office. Bcoz thats how bad they have designed this game (especially cop chases and cop spawning).

To summarise this game:
1. Complete couple of races during day and get into heat level 5.
2. Spawn at night with a heli already hovering above You and start a cop chase instantly.
3. The cops in this game are more dirty drivers than the players, bcoz they will ram into anything that gets in between them and You.
4. Escape the pursuit only to start a new one instantly. 
5. And voila, You have entered an existential crisis on WTF am I doing in my life for past 2 hours getting chased by endless dirty swarm of cops. 
6. 90% of the time is spent in running from cops, 10% time spent on races which are anyways sabotaged by them again. :)

P.S: Escaping the pursuit is manageable, but instantly after the pursuit is escaped, some random heli or cop car spawns next to the player and here we go again. Once I got into and escaped 8 cop chases back to back for 2 hours, just to finally make it to a race, which again got sabotaged by SWAT cars ramming into me, while all other racers in the race got free pass. This game is that dumb. 

Few other dumb things in this game:
1. There are auxiliary addons like signal jammers, undercover racer etc. And they are expensive, which is fine. But whats the point if You install it once on a ride and it cant be used for other rides even if the ride on which signal jammer is originally installed is parked in garage. Felt kind of dumb. Performance addons stuck to a ride is fine, but signal jammer? Really?
2. The heat is tied to the player and not the ride, like WTF? You stove away the high heat ride, pick a new ride and move out of garage and still heat level is 5.
3. Chevy Corvette cop cars can keep up with Bugatti Chiron!!

This game thought me what Alt+F4 does and this key set has become my best friend while playing this game. The back to back loop of start and escape pursuit is so boring and frustrating. Stay away for this piece of shit.

Before getting into the details: If you buy this game for 20 30 bucks it WILL feel worth if you give it some time. In my opinion the game feels vastly different in alot of areas compared to e.g. heat, and getting used to that is a longer process.+
- enemy racers have a surprising amount of character and personality - I do remember more than half of them by name and their character. well done integrating them into the game.

Pros:
- Cool new effects that actually feel like a good part of the game after some time
- Story short, but way better than in Heat (still not Most Wanted level but decent)
- Amazing selection of cars and tuning kits, Tuning UI very similar to Heat.
- homerun of inclusivity: The game is packed with culture, music and characters from all backgrounds, nationalities, genders, you name it. And it doesn't even feel forced after you get used to it. 
- New ""Boost Nitrous"" that adds one more level of complexity to driving, albeit a very easy one (press A at the right time
- Rydell happens to be the coolest foster father ever
- RACE TIERS: Cars have tiers depending on their power and how much you tune them and race against cars in the same Tier. No more PUSH EVERYTHING TO THE MAX
- you can go across terrain with a Streettuned car without going 80km/h max
- almost everything in this game is smashable making cross country travel easy
- car delivery jobs that allow you to unlock custom tuned rides

Now, to the Cons: 
- Cop AI is pretty horrid. I have only gotten caught once in the entire playthrough even though I have really been trying to, even on very hard. Cops need to be tougher.
- to make upfor shitty Cop AI they spawn EVERYWHERE so insetad of heated chases its endless chase most of the time
- theres just too much customization that leads to confusion (e.g. handling adjustment leading to very shit base handling on cars at times, complete RNG). 
- The RESETS. GOD. This game will reset you legit half a second after making a mistake that you are still fixing - more often than not you would have been perfectly fine without the reset.
- Reset reset your drift bonus X score completely --> making Drift events an absolutely tedious grind in this game and not enjoyable. Do not recommend
- new race type is drift with added benefits that just in essence makes it a way easier drift event. Really nice easy money early on.
- The AI is WAY harder to beat in the beginning/ when they drive beginner cars. Every corner will be cut perfectly and the first few races might feel impossible to get first, until you are halfway through the game and suddenly every race is a walk in the park. This NEEDS adjustment, but I doubt it is happening.
- related to the point above: You will have to turn every penny for the first 75% of the game, and then you will make so much you dont know what to spend it on. needs adjustment.
- rubberbanding of enemy racer AI is way too user friendly. If i total people rarely get more than 300-400m ahead before mysteriously slowing down. Cmon EA, let those bots shit on me.
- custom tuned rides are across the board too expensive to be unlocked in the first 75% of the game. Kinda sad to be honest.


All in all - Unbound is DIFFERENT. Loading this up and playing it for the first time felt hella weird, almost out of place; but all it took was 3 or 4 sessions and suddenly I couldnt stop booting up the game to know more about the characters, story, and earn more hard worked for cash to be able to finally buy a new ride. The general level of frustration was alot higher than in my HEAT playthrough - but while some of that frustration is justified and unnecessary due to just bad game design, it is also a 2 sided coin and can also pull you back into the game and over the hurdle holding you back.",1685176285,1685176285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1: various regressions compared to nfs heat:
- failed to make a grip model
- separated the career from the muliplayer
- now players who ram others during race are rewarded (least toxic mulitplayer feature)
- they remove quick reactions, which was a pretty fun way to communicate
- less races
- no cop chase during race

2: annoying stuff:
- cops in exploration are still a no-fun feature
- cars are painfully slow to unlock for multiplayer
- community seems to have degraded, with players racing in less fair play ways, advertising their youtube channel in their banner, staying AFK in race
- in career mode, they tried to narrate a mayoral election over radio emissions, it's overrall quite cringe and it ends in a very cynical and muddled message
- wanna compete in S+ class? buy a super car or get forked, no tuning for you

3: commendable parts
- areas look more lived in with NPCs
- story characters are pretty cool
- visual design is good

THE GOOD:

- The graphics are nice, minus the cartoon crap.
- Decently optimized, ran it maxed out on a 6700 XT at 1440p, no FSR. Never dropped below 65 FPS, not a hint of stuttering, loads pretty fast, all and all a pretty good port.
- The map is easily one of the best in the series, probably the only one that feels like an actual place as opposed to a theme park for street racers.
- Your opponents are actual characters now, with backstories, unique models, etc. Call it a surface level feature if you want but it's a lot more satisfying to beat the CPU when it has a face and a name.

THE BAD:
- Audio is fucked, even at maximum volume I could barely hear the engine, and that's not even taking into account the dialogue which drops the volume even further when a character says something.
- Still no mouse support apart from moving the camera around in photo mode and customization. The keyboard controls still have keybindings that can't be changed, and the game still doesn't let you know what they are.
- Game is stupidly easy even on the highest difficulty, but at the same time Forza AI is in full effect, meaning you have to get into first place early otherwise you will not be able to catch up to the CPU driver in first place even if you drive perfectly.
- The police have been reduced to being just a mild inconvenience. They were easily the best part of Heat's feature-set but in this game they're more reminiscent of Heat Level 1 cops in Most Wanted, such a waste. They should've just pulled a Carbon and copy-pasted them from the last game.
- The soundtrack is one of the worst in the series, though I think it still loses to Heat.
- The car handling is practically copy-pasted from Heat, but with extra understeer and some really, really annoying fish-tailing.
- Reinvented the wheel with nitrous... why/
- Crap story and unlikeable characters, though not as bad as Heat's.
- Heat's build-in HDR is gone. Either that or it's not working, I'm not sure, but it worked without issues in Heat.
- Events don't end seamlessly, instead they go through a transition screen which sometimes forces you into a police chase. I have no idea if this is random or not.

- Fast loading times
- Sort of decent performance
- Bought it on sale, else I would be very mad about this purchase
- Takeover is nice race type

Negatives:
- Aweful career progress
- Having A-Class events from the beginning, without the possibility to own an A-Class car
- Heat level is from the start unlocked, so if you are in a B-Class car and get heat level 5, say goodbye to your money
- Grain of salt: don't know if I did something wrong, but the whole picture seems sort of fuzzy, like FSR/DLSS
would be active all the time, despite I have disabled it
- Because of the point above, it is sometimes hard to detect which way you need to go
- Handling of cars is aweful
- Nitro seems to do nothing
- Police chases are way too dificult and the dev that thought, missing ""Pursuit Breakers"" is a good idea,
should be fired

I can look past the cartoony look an the corny story line, if the racing and cars were good. Sadly they are not. 
This game looks like a knockoff of NFS Heat (which on its own was also not the best of the best, but fun with friends). The whole garage and customization are almost the same. But here you have a hard semi-locked linear path, where you have to grind in the solo player, to get to better cars and upgrades.
It also doesn't help that your car is always either bad, or mediocre at best, but as soon as you upgrade too much, it jumps into the next tier (where it's the worst of its class). So in the end, you want to keep your car at an arbitrary upper 'number', to keep it in its class. Example: you might even wat to put worse tires on or have more downforce, just so it knocks you back some points, to remain in a class. Even then, the CPU is elastic banding to the extreme and some cars always have more topspeed than you.
The cop chases are also not that much more interesting. With a lower tier car (or set up for drifting) you are fish bait. Also hiding from helicopters is sometimes extremely stupid. While they might lose track of you, sometimes they just spawn in and somehow always keep hovering over you for 10 minutes, while you have to remain hidden (engine off) the whole time.
This game has not enough fun and looks more like a chore, just to be able to get the nice cars and parts.

You race with your customised car against your rivals and/or police. Which might be a big ""ok dude"", but compared to previous instalments it is very well put together and fun (I'm playing it on insane and loving the risk vs reward system).

The game has a very solid theme with both music and aesthetics tying very well together, consequently creating one of the most artistically interesting NFS games ever.

I love the art style, it's a game, it doesn't have to be 100% photo realistic everything kind-of-thing. I appreciate the kinds of cosmetic car customization in the game as well. 

I play exclusively single-player, there are things to note, though
1. The handling can be improved, if its not possible to change the drift/slide physics, at least give us some tuning options like what we see in Underground 2 (brake bias, front/rear grip, etc etc). 
2. Provide a test track, again like the Underground 2. I spent 50k on car parts, to test it out in the track either I have to spent another 12k on the type of race I built the car for just to realize I need 4-5 races to get it right or I've got to drive to Kennedy Test Track, on the way there I got $100 from a kind and charitable police officer. So after testings, I have to go back to the garage, skip time, all of that just because I decided for a tire change? and do the same thing after deciding the handling is better with the old tires?
3. please give a reset button. sometimes it took 0.5 secs to reset, other times 1.5 secs. Sometimes you hit a bump and it resets, some other time you hit a wall and have to reverse, turn, blablabla. just let us reset the car by a push of a button.

Is this game worth $70? If I'm being honest, yes. Most people who are drawn to this new Need For Speed clearly haven't played a racing game since the Blackbox Era. And you can tell, because most negative reviews for Unbound are people saying ""This isn't Most Wanted 2005."" ""This isn't Carbon.""

If you're main comparison to a racing game is one from a decade and a half ago, you're delusional. Just look at any well received racing game from the current Era, and realize that Arcade racers are far and few between these days. The only racing games played are simulation-type games. Forza Horizon has been dominating the racing genre because Arcade racers have been slept on for a long time.

Need For Speed: Unbound took the formula of the simulation-like experience of NFS: Heat and added one of the most satisfying boost systems I've ever had the pleasure of using. The two seperate bars of nitrous for auxiliary and passive is probably the most innovative change the series has taken besides the artistic direction. You won't find a game that has cornering like Unbound, but its still comprehensive and is very fun to learn.

The graphics and art style of this game are unmatched. Forza Horizon takes the cake for raw graphics over Unbound for sure, but the art style and character definitely gives it an edge for the Arcade Racing experience. And for anyone wanting to turn graphical effects off completely needs to stop complaining, you can't just have a game do whatever you want. That's a childish view and its plastered over most negative reviews for this game.

The biggest takeaway from my review is that you shouldn't expect a Most Wanted 2005, and you shouldn't expect a simulation racer. It's so sad looking at all of the negative reviews, fueled by anger, likely due to not giving the game an honest chance. I'd say don't let the overall Mixed rating for this game discourage you from purchasing it. If you actually want the game, you'll buy it.

The game play itself is terrible compared to the last few NFS games in the series. I've dealt with multiple glitches which can fixed by update, but its just another thing to mention. The money making aspect is pretty annoying considering you have to grind to get enough for another vehicle and grind to build it, and it feels like way to much work for how little the reward is. I think they messed up on the difficulty, because I didn't notice any difference between hard or easy modes. So because of everything listed above I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I am hoping that EA listens to its customers and learns from its mistakes, but until the next one comes out, this has been a major letdown from a long time fan and supporter of the NFS series.",1684815404,1684815404,False,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game has a ton of problems: terrible story filled with token diversity characters, even worse soundtrack, mediocre Ohio map, clumsily structured online with no lobby queue from a menu. But, BUT... This game doesn't force you to use brake2drift. I know that Heat didn't either but that grip was terrible and not worth using. I've beaten the entire game on the hardest difficulty, won more playlists online than I've lost, and reached max level, all while not preforming a single canned drift animation. Vs skilled opposition. I am 100% serious. And it's not ultra janky or clunky or unwieldy 98% of the time, it's fun to use.

Is the handling as good as Black Box? Fuck no. Not even close, and the drifting that they still cling to so badly is even worse than Heat, where it was atrocious already. And a lot of people may be turned off by the further difficulty they added to the single player experience, as it plays like a true Souls-Like-Racing Abomination. But it's still Need for Speed, you can still put a bunch of customizations (of which there still needs to be a lot more) on your ricebox, there are still exhilarating police chases so long as you don't cheese the AI. Except this time, I think I'm actually having fun playing this one. It's mostly the handling, though.

I didn't mention the graphics, because I don't care. This game looks as good as any other. Cell Shaded comic art is stylistic, not worse. And you can disable the effects on your own car by using the cloaked preset.
They need to let the M3 Die. Keep it as a car you can use but keep it out of the story until you can write a good one. 
Game needs more cars people will use. This game needed more muscle cars, and customization options like blowers.

TLDR: Game's definitely not worth 70, or 50, buy it at say... 20 if you're interested. It's actually fun this time.",1684813680,1684813680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The whole Heat system mechanic not refreshing from day to night is terrible, I'm so glad I got this game on discount, I would not have payed full price.

TL:DR.
Pro's
- Its a racing game
- Good looking cars, Nice customisation.
- Cops are smarter than previous game, albeit, incredibly difficult, Terrible street design doesn't aid making cop chases fun.

Cons
- This new stylised drift smoke / graphic system interferes with your view, making you most likely to crash.
- Drifting system is dog, The worst I've seen in a game
- Game play is OK, Not great, Just ok.
- Cars feel slow and sluggish, handling is clumsy and not enjoyable.
- Accumulating heat throughout the entire day, you do well in the day time and go into night, your stuck with that heat, meaning night races are the only safe way to make money.
- There is a set calendar system you have to follow, you cannot go out of your own accord and just enjoy the streets so limited game play.
- Bad map design makes cop chases incredibly difficult to escape
- WHY ARE YOU MAKING COP CHASES A MANDATORY THING AFTER SOME RACES! Here, do this race, get a bunch of money, Get a heat level, and enjoy being chased and annihilated by the cops immediately afterwards, What were you thinking!
- Just not enjoyable, I'm so glad I bought this on discount, I'd never pay full price for this.

This is how I feel this game could've been better at

1) No cartoonish style graphics
2) A more serious story line with no continuous annoying lines from the protagonists
3) Could've been a continuation of story from atleast NFS Heat, or even Most Wanted, or Undercover somehow
4) For god's sake, when is EA finally gonna bring in dashboard view in their games. Even Ubisoft's The Crew 2 has it, so why can't the biggest racing title put in that simple thing in their game?!

This one just cant hold me, I would not recommend this unless you get a deep sale, the car and customisation aspects are pretty great, old school style body part, performance upgrades, etc.

The overall problem is basically the gameplay loop, you go through 3-4 races before youre just locked into 5 stars and can no longer freely try to roam about or enjoy other races. While you are doing this same dogwater pain cycle just to earn bits of cash to maybe afford garage upgrades or engine changes that would actually let you compete.

It stays true to me that the last ""street"" style Need for Speed I was able to enjoy and love was the OG Most Wanted, I need a remake of that. This game for me is solely ruined about how much focus was put behind the cops and being locked into basically having to deal with them until your next day cycle, meaning you cant enjoy just driving around, trying to go through the races for the fun of it, get collectibles etc.

The cops are just absolute wizards for the most part of chases where you are around a wall behind dumpsters and cars or under a ramp, and they still got eagle eye vision on you.

As a racing game, it's fantastic

Sure, the handling is arcadey, but this is an arcade game (and I will never get Forza fanboys who shit on this game for that). 
It's still very addicting and satisfying to play. 
The visual style looks really unique and works well with the rest of the game (minus the characters which feel a bit out of place, but you don't see them while driving)
Grinding cash, doing races, doing cop chases, all that actual *gameplay* feels really nice

But everything else is meh
Story is cringey(though that's not new for an NFS title)
Music is ass 
And I really despise how they try to push that the street racers are in the right and the law is ""wrong"" in these new NFS games. You are in the wrong for driving like an idiot on public roads. That's what makes the game fun -- like GTA. I much preferred stuff like Most Wanted 2005's serious cop chatter and general acceptance that *you* were in the wrong legally but were racing for your own ends.

The Campaign very a well done revenge story,(Kinda reminds me of L.A. RUSH)  with some pretty lame/cringe dialog. 


The campaign and the MP are separate progression systems. I like this cause it opens up more fulfilling game play compared to older NFS titles that where a hybrid of both and once you beat the story missions the MP is somewhat lacking outside of bragging rights and cash.

But can we talk about the gameplay it self. Handling, is hella hard, because that extra nitrous bar doesnt charge quick in a turn and if it does charge sometimes it just make you slip off the road instead of gripping your forward.
 
You can destroy almost anything in this game, but sometimes there is that stupid one object that is just immune to cars. Sometimes when i am in a race i cannot take apart which things i can hit which i cant.

Police chases wouldn't be that hard, if my darn car would not be stuck all the time in weirdest ways possible. For example: My car flips on its side and it keep sliding in one direction. it doesn't flip back or it doesn't get reset. So I get caught by police. Or at times where you off-road a bit to make a short cut in a corner. And suddenly car just starts flying. You crash, you get caught.

I don't know if its just me, but something is just not right in this game, some things aren't polished all the way.

This is not a wholly bad game and certainly not as bad as it could've been, but that's not an achievement either. The game fails at more things than it succeeds at and i will lay down the points briefly below:
[olist]
[*] [u][b]Zero replayability.[/b][/u] The game gives you no incentive to keep playing both online and offline, car collecting doesn't feel rewarding because everything costs a lot and up until the Vol. 2 update the payouts for online were unreasonably low. Once you've finished the campaign and played through 50 or so playlists you've experienced everything the game has to offer. Playlists are completely fixed so you'll be repeating the same races again and again till you're sick of them.

[*] [u][b]Balancing and a meaningless car list.[/b][/u] The existence of meta cars in every tier means people will flock to those cars specifically and min/max those builds instead of branching out to a wider car selection because there's simply no point in that, you'll just lose. I wanna make it clear that there are some choices among the meta cars still so it's not just one car beating everything but still, around 80% of the car list is completely useless.

[*] [u][b]A completely off base thematic tone.[/b][/u] The game tries really hard to create a ""street racing"" vibe, so hard in fact that it almost comes off as comical. You have maybe 10 or so racers in the whole city (apparently nobody else cares top race in Lakeshore) that all come off as ridiculous caricatures with their personalities being comparable to a sponge maybe. Yes NFS has always been cheesy with the characters but there's a difference between that and writing characters that are just caricatures of what the developers think street racers are supposed to be like. Simply put, they're stale and that's far worse than being cheesy.

[*] [u][b]Police pursuits and annoyance.[/b][/u] The only challenging part of police pursuits is that they're aggressively annoying and makes you wanna quit the game entirely out of boredom. This is not a normal thing to feel in a NFS police pursuit. They over-corrected after making Heat's police unbearably difficult and ended up with a system that doesn't even excite you in any way. They perfected the balance between aggression and rewarding in past games like Most Wanted and Rivals so i have no idea why they can't just learn from their past works.
[/olist]
[u]To balance off this review here's a shorty list of things that Unbound does do well (imo):[/u]
[olist]
[*] Handling is more bearable and grippier than Heat (but even still the drifting is just terrible)
[*] The cel-shaded effects do look cool (but even then they were too cowardly to go all out so it feels half baked)
[*] The graphics is pretty good, it's a very good looking game for the most part with high-poly/high-resolution models and textures accompanied by a great lighting system.

Great customization, though it doesn't push the needle too far from where it was left in the previous game. New car effects are neat. The new cel-shaded characters seem to be hit or miss with some. Though personally, I enjoy it, and it may be a step in the right direction.

Car selection is decent, and offering more ways to earn cars is a nice plus too.

New approach to events is greatly appreciated, its pretty creative. However, it's awfully limited considering that you don't have access to the events that you may want to play on a whim. Have not engaged in multiplayer yet (I don't tend to hear the best things about it though, unfortunately). Not the biggest fan in the separation of solo and multiplayer progression, though it makes sense in some ways. Hopefully multiplayer receives some more support and content, as this may be what affects most players attitude towards the game overall.

Cop chases have not been this engaging in nfs in years, you can expect a challenge that does require a bit of care, but certainly not too overbearing if handled correctly.
Race routes are decent. 
Love the idea of giving your cpu opponents a little more character. It adds a little more flavor to the world. Would be nice to see them roaming around (with the ability to interact with them) like in 2015 or payback though.

Did not find the map very memorable in any particular way, feels like there was some generic formula that was copy and pasted from last couple games.

Music is hit or miss with most people it seems (go figure). It's not that big a deal, and if it is then I would suggest playing your own music from another source and lower in-game music.

New story is okay. Personally found it to be more engaging than the previous 3. Dialogue is extremely hit or miss most times and tends to lean towards the latter. Often times dialogue feels forced in order to make a point about very important socioeconomic problems. Or other times it feels the need to let the player know what time period they're playing in. A lot of these story beats, themes, ideas and etc. can be made without being so on the nose 100% of the time. While all of it is appreciated, it can certainly improve in delivery at times.

please make drifting events more interesting lol

Really hoping that there is continued support for this game as well. Would hate for it to die before it can reach it's potential.

this game is a masterpiece after forza series, because this game have lots of stuff that forza series doesn't ""has"", some of them

-Story: which is so good so far, can't even compare to forza because there is no story in forza.

-Difficulty: in forza you can get 250+ cars within 30 minutes after introduction to game (thx to wheelspins) well, that's not a good thing because when you have so many cars in ur garage u can't enjoy the game because every car feels dull, boring after a few races, Unbound has perfect system compared to forza, you can buy cars but it's difficult and every car feels great to customize (after nearly 10 hours of gameplay I only have 2 cars and I customised both of them to perfect-also I can't afford new car atm.) and finally, this game has perfect day/progress system (can't explain it here, it's a bit complex)

-Arcade: forza series feels real driving simulator, ofc forza has way better graphics but Unbound has a story and a purpose to progress, and waaaaay more action.

also character design looks so good, believe me it won't feels like while you drive, I know in gameplay clips characters and car effects looks dumb but while you drive, all the effects feels perfect, u should try first.

in conclusion, this game is way more superior thn forza series, trust me bro, u'll get bored after a few hours in forza because there is no story, no purpose, nothing but in Unboud there is story, cops, purpose (spoiler: ur bf betrays u) and perfectly customisable cars.

I know it's a bloody ""ea games"" but, just buy the damn game bruv, u'll thank me later.",1684489285,1684489416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In itself a good Need for Speed. 
Lots of cars, lots of tuning options, nice day/night cycle. 
The graphics are also very good and I find the control of the cars very pleasant.

Is very positive to mention and I think that if I remember correctly there was no need for speed until now, where are npcs on foot in the city, that are on the move, which breathes much more life into the whole game world and its very good for the feeling! :)

Small point of criticism, I don't understand why these comic effects have to be on the cars, I don't have an option to deactivate them! would be great if you could patch it in so that you can simply switch off this effects! (maybe I just didn't find the option...) 
what i don't understand either, but bothers me a lot less, is why do the characters look like comic characters, but that's just a side issue.

all in all, after some playing time you get used to the comic graphic parts in the otherwise ""realistic"" world and it doesn't bother you anymore. (or less...) for me its ok now, but an option to switch off the comic driving effects would still be a dream! :)

Nevertheless, this game is well varied, fun and I can recommend it!",1684371963,1684372287,True,1,2,0.446428567171096802,0,True,False,False

. game crashed twice
. second time sat at a black screen doing nothing
. first time just launched then exited immediately
. finally get in a game, go through options ultra settings
. Listen to some dumb ass telling me to press the A button on my controller to confirm my choices etc
realise this game is aimed at an age group who watches pepper pig so that would be BP my guess considering the mentality
. performance seems a bit wonky but ok its ultra ill turn it down
. performance didn't change
. turn it down
. fps still no better
. minimum settings no resolution drs stuff
. still same fps
. This game hates older cpu like i5 4670k even if it is overclocked the snot out of it. cpu usage 98% for what a race like any other video game? Like WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY CPU EXACTLY?? THERES NOTHING GOING ON.
. The battlefield engine aka frostbite really showing its struggles here with excessive cpu usage for the little it has to show for it. Firestorm runs better than this when populated. BFV 64 player games run better with destruction WTF NFS?
. Pass the first race anyway go open world driving
. seems ok in open parts but a bit lack luster
. go near buildings and built up areas 
. performance gone a wee bit wonky
. go into the city
. performance just awful
. change settings while in the city
. can sort of get it playable but just not good enough to enjoy it with a VRR monitor falls out of refresh rate range for vrr
turn up settings try smoothing it out more load on gpu
. game stutters, runs in some weird slow motion at times, suddenly jumpy.
. Gameplay wise looks and plays similar to any other generic need for speed game
. graphics wise looks like heat with cartoon effects. 
. I expect to see pepper pig about and some teletubbies racing about some where. This games aimed at the unintelligent dumbass easy to please american energy drink kids
. Refund game go play a better game or save money and wait for another high value game to go on sale like elden ring or some shit.
.Don't bother with this game honestly what crap. Its cringe too. 110mph in a freakin 240sx and your story woman in passenger seat be like OMG I CANT BELIEVE WE MADE THIS FROM A JUNKER CAR.. B# please its not fast. Grandads volvo does that on the regular shut the f up..

It's not trying to be the all serious simulator in a controller and ending being too boring for casual players and too simple/limited for the advanced ones, like Forza Motorsport, Gran Turismo and GRID Legends.

Look, Unbound is an arcade game within reason, unlike franchises like Asphalt which are pure chaos. And for the granpa here, this is a celebration of the glory days of NFS with Underground 2 and Most Wanted (original).

There's a day cycle and a night cycle (Underground). During the day you get Most Wanted vibes with gas stations, for repair, cops, etc. During the night the feeling is more street-illegal-fast-and-furious-underground2. The soundtrack is awesome, is fresh, is exciting, it matches both cycles.

The art is pretty and fresh. There's no uncanny valley for the characters, it's like an anime mixed with real world cars. And because of the anime vibe, the cars/world look even more realistic because of their contrast. 

I'm a simracer, with all that seriousness, and I couldn't get the smile of my face while and after I've played NFS Unbound.
