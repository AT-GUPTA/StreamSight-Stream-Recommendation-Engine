I got the base game and can do quite a bit, no need to get the deluxe or whatever unless you just want to spend more money. It was a lot more fun than I expected! I played it for a lot longer than meant to, haha... It isn't just a greedy cash grab and actually has great potential. It is so much fun!

This is weird, but I wish there was a small romance option... Really wish I could have Elsa as my girlfriend.

Yeah, also, Donald is super glitchy even though an update was sent out to fix him. He gets angry all the time and sometimes the sound goes off and he is invisible.

Update to review: (10/27/2023) (Positive)
Love the game, the only thing that now bothers me is Bell's shoulders... They look as though they aren't in their sockets, kinda creeping me out. No new glitches or much else happening. It has a lot to do with each event! Looking forward to Halloween and hoping for some spooky friends to join the Valley! I have recommended it to many of my friends.

Update to Review: (2/18/2024) (Negative)
Less to do in the game as you go, mostly just micro-transactions and moonstone collecting. The dlc was kind of a let down. It was a good game to start, but it has gone down the drain. It mostly just involves a daily check in to collect my blue chest.

Beyond that, the gameplay loops are repetitive and grindy. They require you to spend at least an hour daily collecting items that aren't relevant or useful if you go to a different realm, meaning you will have to repeat that loop for every realm that you have.

my only criticisms is the monetization (especially with them walking back on the free to play model. a full priced game shouldnt have a battlepass, i genuinely believe those should be offered only by free games), and the amount of time you have to wait between each star path/update. i also wish, and hope eventually, the character's and their interactions would become more indepth and varied, especially with their interactions with each other.

I no longer can give this game any positive words.  After changing the entire premise of how the game was going to work in order to cash in, they started with the first $30 DLC, in addition to what we paid for the first part.
The quickly slapped together DLC is worthless.  It's been out for over 2 months now and the main quests are completely unplayable and although those of us who have the glitched quests have sent in messages about these game breaking glitches, we've been ignored.  Instead of fixing the DLC we gave them money for, they are obviously slapping together another quick cash grab to put out somewhere down the line.
AGAIN... WE PAID FOR A DLC WHERE THE MISSIONS ARE GLITCHED AND YOU CAN'T PLAY THEM.
On top of that, the price of the DLC wasn't even worth is, as the lack of character additions and things like no updated Scrooge store show.  How many colors of the same couch do we need in this game?????

I loved the idea behind this game and pre-ordered the founder edition. But as an experience, it has just progressively gotten worse and worse to the point where I can't help but feel disappointed every time I open it.

Not only were they dishonest about the lack of micro-transactions locking story (as they now have an expansion that is the same cost as the entire game), but now since the game isn't free to play (another promise they have broken after many shelled out for early access), it's still locked to the platforms you buy it on. I bought this game hoping to eventually play across my pc and consoles and with my friends, as free-to-play makes it easy to invite friends to play. 

This game has EVERY type of micro transaction there is. A battle pass, a cosmetic shop, and now expansions a la sims. It's far too much, and it's driving this game to the ground. It's Disney, even one of these monetization models would've made more than enough to keep it thriving. I did not mind at all when it was just the star path. 

I was excited to play this with my friends, but I would not recommend it at all in its current state. I think the bad press this game has gotten will sour many people from trying this game, and it's a shame that such a good idea has gone down like this.

They didn’t take any risks and some of their earlier decisions seemed to suggest a bit of inexperience, which isn’t surprising for a company that still markets itself as the “#1 Mobile Video Games Developer”. They rely mostly on nostalgia for DDLV’s success which is fine. 

The quests that are the ""hardest"" are those that are time locked to make the content last longer. Some things are still bulky like storage management, cooking, and crop planting/watering. They could stand to release some quality of life updates but, again, some of these issues artificially increase the ""bulk"" of the game so maybe that’s just how they intend it to be. After all, DDLV has been out for more than a year now.

So, given the amount of time I’ve spent in the Valley, why the negative review?

Gameloft simply cannot be trusted. This isn’t even just about them going back on their promise to make the game F2P, I already bought the Ultimate Edition for $70 over a year ago. The real slap in the face is that they intend to release their first expansion and charge $30 for it. So if I buy that DLC, I will have spent $100.

New players will get the chance to buy the “Gold Edition” for the same $70. [i]However[/i], this [i]new[/i] edition will include everything I already have - [b]plus that $30 expansion[/b]. So my reward for having stuck by this crooked, thieving, lying company is an extra $30 charge.

I’ve stopped buying cosmetics and I don’t think I’ll be buying the DLC. The microtransactions for cosmetics already felt a little iffy since the items offered in Scrooge’s shop (paid for by in-game gold) have, for the majority of the past year, been the same damn couches every single day but at least these paid items weren’t required. It’s just a little crappy for a game in which decorating is a major part of gameplay to like…not have anything interesting to decorate with. 

This is just a step too far. DDLV is obviously going to become a massive money sink and there are so many better games to spend my money on. Maybe they'll figure things out eventually, but right now I can't recommend putting any faith in them.

[b]UPDATE:[/b] I still haven't purchased A Rift In Time so my time in DDLV is basically over, I have no quests left and they figure that my $70 investment has been paid out apparently. In the last week alone, my game has crashed twice, and badly enough to force my entire Steam Deck to restart. I game almost exclusively on the Deck and this has never happened with any other game, indie or otherwise.

I'm also experiencing lag while running around and harvesting, and placing/removing furniture isn't working properly. Either I can't pick an item up or an item I just placed disappears from both my inventory and where I placed it. I can't sell items sometimes either. Basically, enough is going wrong that the game needs to be restarted on a regular basis just to get it to work.

They're not exactly selling me on handing over more cash. I didn't even finish The Royal Winter Star Path.",1698435680,1707590524,False,17,0,0.513815224170684814,0,True,False,True

Then one night I finally made myself sit down to try it and over 160 hours later I can say that it is the one game I make sure to play on my days off. The story line for the OC is pretty sweet and heartwarming. I didn't think a Disney game could/would be able to be get me to cry, yet here I am telling you all that I did ;_;

 I did rush myself by buying The Rift In Time when I hadn't yet fulfilled The Valley. Definitely take your time when progressing, there is a LOT of content to get through and more to come!

 Pro tips: 

Move all harvest-able plants/shrubs to your nearest home for easy gathering. 

Make a whole room dedicated to storage. The game has no limits on storage chests so make them to your hearts content. I have a whole room for my chests to go into. I fill it mostly with my ingredients as food is something you will find yourself using the MOST imo. 

 This one is optional, but for me I always have one massive garden in each biome and daily plant the best( fastest growing) crops for either stock or sale( pumpkins are so worth the resale).

 The cons are that there can be massive glitches at times, especially if you play this on the Switch. I have also had the game freeze on certain images and then have to close my game and restart it. 

 It is just like every other farming simulation game, but like every game, it's all about preference. I personally love getting to live my Disney dream, buying the cool clothes and seeing my favorite characters too. The housing is ALMOST even better than Final Fantasy Online( lmao)

But once you get through the story arc it becomes just another fetch quest grind-a-thon, made ever more frustrating when you have to return on certain days or certain TIMES of day. There's nothing deep here, no great conversations you can have with the characters, no in-depth build mode, no big world to explore. This game was conceived originally for phones and you can tell.
The breaking point for me, which seems to be true for a lot of people, was the nickel-and-dime DLC. I get more and more annoyed by games built on this model, and I'm especially offended since I was one of the original buyers who paid up front for the game. Disney/Gameloft especially always prices their stuff way too high, and no way am I justifying giving them money for cute little collectibles that will mean nothing the instant I uninstall the game from lack of content. I'm all for a well-built expansion pack (as evidenced by my egregious hour count in the Sims) but I'm now happy enough to let the night thorns take over again.",1707497261,1707497261,False,8,0,0.531791090965270996,0,True,False,False

[h1]TL:DR[/h1]
[i]Coziness ruined by retracted promises. It was too good to be true.[/i]

[h1]The Good Stuff[/h1]
+Very chill gameplay pace, where time is up to you in how you want to approach quests and in designing the village. 
+Lots of freedom in how you design the look and feel of your valley. Move character's homes, the local foliage, trees, gardening, and much more to make your environment to your own personal style. 
+Quests galore! Irrespective of intention, you can fulfill multiple styles of quest lines by means of interacting with characters, the environment, traveling to other realms, DreamSnaps (See ""The Ok Stuff""), and Seasonal Events. 
+I found myself grinding happily at times, which I tend to avoid grinding in general. Fishing, Mining, Foraging, and other activities strike a solid balance of not over-indulging in an activity for less than ideal gains and remaining interactive enough to be worthwhile and fulfilling. 
+The main story begins fairly quickly and then starts to plateau to a more friendly pace, allowing some room to explore side quests and other aspects of the game. I envision it's like beginning in the neck of an upside down bottle and going up from there. 

[h1]The Ok Stuff[/h1]
=Fetch-quest heavy, so lots of lists to sift through and find every item. Great for exploring, hard to do for longer periods of time. 
=Lots of cosmetic bugs such as characters morphing through objects, 
=Characters don't have the most unique dialogue when it comes to simply chatting with them. It was on Day 2 of playing this that Goofy already repeated a set of questions. I've only had this happen maybe 2 or 3 times with some early characters like Scrooge and Mickey having no repeated dialogue. 
=I do not like being able to see every single item that can and will be available in the game through most of the ""Collections"" screen. I would prefer the Collections to be hidden until I discover said items, maybe showing how many items are within or hints as to where to find items I have yet to gather. 
=You can feed the wildlife. It is absolutely adorable, but IRL I work in outdoor education and guiding and it just goes against my moral coding that you can do this XD 
=DreamSnaps doesn't do it for me. It's a silly little side quest-like feature that allows for some cute propped pictures, but it still feels limited and has a clunky interface. 
=Mobile game-esque. Not that mobile games are inherently bad, but the interface feels tacky and gimmicky. 

[h1]The Bad Stuff[/h1]
--Was promised as free-to-play since the Early Access launch in Sept. 2022. This has recently been retracted and instead the game will have its official launch on Dec. 5th, 2023 at a cost of $40 (Note: Currently $30 for the base game). This decision was made almost 1 month out from launch. 
--Paid content expansions (See ""The Noteworthy Stuff"" for more info regarding this) will cost $30 each. These include characters, cosmetics, and quest lines. The current free updates also include all of this, but now some content will be segmented and restricted behind a pay wall on top of already paying $40+ for this title. 
-Purchasing any of the upgraded Founder's Editions does not grant any of the future paid content expansions. You must also pay the additional cost for each expansion on top of the Editions which were designed to help support this game through Early Access. Feels like a very unbalanced return on investment for those supporters. 
-Microtransactions exist. They are purely optional and are only for cosmetics, but given all the above points for ""The Bad Stuff"", the fact that these will continue in their current state and receive more support further affects the economic model of this game negatively. Helps confirm a money-driven approach. 

[h1]The Noteworthy Stuff[/h1]
*Paid content expansions have been known since the beginning of Early Access. These were to begin with the official launch alongside the current free updates. Although I, and the majority of others, despise that characters can and will be gated behind paid content, this has been transparent and expected. (You could say they kept this part of the promise). 
*Owners of any Founder's Edition will receive the Cosmetics of the upcoming Gold Edition of the official release and an extra 2500 moonstones ($10 worth). 
*Most common comparison to this game I hear is Animal Crossing, whereas I like to think of Stardew Valley and MySims. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
My initial impression of this game in early 2023 was ""Ah yes, a Disney mobile game that got slapped on to Steam."" However, after some research into the project recently and some friends who played the game on Switch, I was convinced to give it a go while it was on a sale. If all promises were kept, I would have recommended this game to others, but adding ""Wait for it to go free-to-play."" instead of purchasing it in Early Access. I did not feel like the $20 I spent was wasted, more so a slightly unpolished game that held great potential, but having a Disney IP full of reputation and notoriety to back it up balanced out in my head that it was not worth it if it was going to be free-to-play anyways. After the most recent announcement, now I feel like I wasted $20. It is unfair especially to those who purchased the Deluxe and Ultimate editions and to those that promoted the game heavily via YouTube and other platforms with the tagline of ""It's going to be free-to-play!"". The potential wasn't wasted, it was intentionally replaced with shameless greed.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2940181226

[b] What is Disney Dreamlight Valley? [/b]

Disney Dreamlight Valley a game with a very good and new story from the disney universe. Though in this game, a lot of disney characters actually interact with each other and have quest lines that involve more then one disney movie's character. I.e Donald and stitch. The main character of this story, which is you has the duty of saving the valley from a dark magic that seems to have befallen it. 

[b] Initial Thoughts: [/b]

""Quite a bit of character customisation, I like it.""
""Why is this so mysterious, I thought it was a DISNEY game?!?!??!?!?!""
""Wow I am very addicted to this game.""

[b] Beginner Player Friendly?  [/b]

I believe this game is very beginner player friendly especially since soon it will also be available on mobile. The game (from what I have heard it should also be going free soon.) It is on almost all platforms and it has nice and easy controls, a simple story line and very good map navagation. The map is fairly small as of right now which also makes it easier for beginners. It is an open world map which is awesome too. 

[b] Game Play: [/b]

The game play itself kind of reminds me of animal crossing mixed with kingdom hearts. Though there isn't any combat in this game. Loads of different disney characters come together in this universe, which you can customise and design the world to your liking. Even Scrooge Mc'Duck is an unlockable character in this game (though he is a little snobby.) You can upgrade the levels with characters to get multiple rewards and benefits to them being a higher level. You also need to plant/harvest crops, fish, dig, and mine items in the game for money or questing purposes. This is a story mode game, every way you can progress is related to a super intense story that seems to have twists every quest... I am not going to tell you more :)

[b] Graphics: [/b]

In my opinion, the graphics are pretty nice even if you have to turn them down all the way. I have not yet had any glitches with the graphics except for sometimes the game kind of jumps which isn't a big deal to me as it is not long or really game changing. 

[b] Community: [/b]

The community for this game are all amazing disney lovers and I couldn't love them more. So excited to see what multiplayer brings to this game!

[b] How long can you play? [/b]

This game has been keeping me busy for a while, I have 109 hours in the game and still haven't leveled up all the characters and still have not completed all the quests. Lately I have been keeping myself busy with the farming.

[b] My Opinion: [/b]

In my opinion I do think this game is worth the money, though if you do not think so you can always wait until it comes out for free in the future! This I think will just mean that some characters will start coming out in DLC's for the game.

But this is possibly a downside, as they make Disney Magic Kingdoms which I played until it became far too ""pay to enjoy"". I play Dreamlight Valley with my 5 year old, and she enjoyed it for a while. Overall, it's pretty decent plot for a game like this, and has lots of Disney characters, plans to expand over time seem good overall.  I paid for the bundle which gave Moonstones and some other things, and it was worth it to me.

I am very surprised by the game because I rtruly didn't expect to get into it.  Hell, it even got me choked-up at one point.  Like, actually crying over my keyboard chocked-up.  It'll get you in the feels in a way that's REALLY unexpected.  This reminds me of the Disney stories from the Golden Age- the ones with really deep and meaningful direction, but it doesn't appear that is the way the game is going to go when you start playing.  You have to give it time, but I absolutely DO believe it's worth it.  I don't believe this was made for kids as it's very apparent from the story itself that was made for those of us who grew up with Disney.  This was a labour of love, and it shows.

To the devs:  Thank you for that one section in the game (I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about).

I don’t think this game should cost as much as it does. If you want the game 100% wait until there is a sale. I like this game. I love the storyline, I like interacting with the characters and seeing how different movie characters interact with one another.
I even bought this game twice. I bought it originally on switch, and later bought it on steam. I even bought the DLC, which again- wait for a sale.

This game is fun, it’s not just a farming game. It’s not just a silly Disney game. The story is actually incredibly meaningful and portrays a deep message. 
This game is incredibly buggy. There are quests that have been reported to be buggy 12 months ago that to this date, haven’t been fixed. I originally quit playing the switch version due to graphic issues and the game crashing so I bought it again on steam, the game is cross save so I still had all my stuff, yay! But I still have game crashes left and right. 
This game has been advertised as cross play, which while technically true for most platforms- isn’t actually true for all platforms. They added deck it Ralph characters to the game to add a multiplayer function, which allows people to visit their friends villages and collect pixels to get new items. 
PlayStation cannot play with any other console other than PlayStation. So if the multiplayer was an aspect you like when considering playing- keep that in mind. 

Don’t get me wrong, I really like this game, and I do recommend it. The story is great, the farming is a little mindless, but that is how most farm sims are. The quests are very objective driven, and I’ve found myself finding it hard to put the game down because I want to follow the quests. 
I even gifted this game to my mother who isn’t a huge video game person, and she beat the main storyline in just a few days, and there is still plenty to do without the DLC.",1707139097,1707139097,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Furthermore, the game is EXTREMELY grinding - and while I love a good one at times- this gets monotonous.

Mining, Fishing, Gardening, Foraging, crafting, cooking, feeding the animals, and digging are a few of the activities you will do in this game, along with doing friendship quests, unlocking more Disney characters, and doing the story quest. There is a story to how the valley got all the night thorns and the characters went either missing or just simply forgot. 

Decorate your valley like you would in Sims. 

DLC - Very similar to the original base game. Just adds more. More characters. And an different valley with a different story line. 

Price - I say it's worth it. The DLC and the base game. For a game that I haven't yet been close to finish even with 104 hours on, it's definitely worth the price. At least in my opinion. The DLC could have been cheaper but it does give a lot to do as well, so I can see why it's also 30 bucks.

Moonstones - Not necessary to purchase. You can get the wall-e and Ursula bundle for free. You get moonstones when you start and it gives enough for the bundles. And even if it doesn't, you get a blue chest every day you log on. Just look around each biome, and you'll find one. It gives you 50 moonstones daily. Might not seem a lot, but trust me, there is so much to do in this game, that it will definitely add up. The rest of the moonstones are basically used for cosmetics. 

This is a very relaxing game with no combat whatsoever. It is a huge grind of a game but it's definitely addictive! I haven't yet finished unlocking all the characters and getting all the DLC finished. So there is a lot to do in this game.

Kids continue to play it but stop running to me when it inevitably goes down.

Visuals are good but story is bit lacking (though they have hints/jabs) about what is going on. Accumulating dreamlight (first type of in-game current) to unlock areas/characters is grindy and is removed from the story. Tasks are pretty random (some of which you haven't unlocked yet like recipes or crops) and work as go fetch this item, sell it, give somebody something, throw down some random decorations or go do so many repetitive tasks (like mining, farming, fishing, cooking). 

Throughout the base game they're constantly pushing or hinting at microtransactions (i.e. spend $$$) for a paid game. For instance,  moonstones (second currency used for some content and aesthetics) are slow to accrual so items that cost 3,000 or more are reserved for those who have money to spend or lot of time to spare.

It has a farming element (although there aren't many growable items), you can fish, mine, cook and forage whilst you complete quests. 

That being said it isn't without its faults, the game suffers from clunky pathways especially when your quest is to speak to someone in a river (Ariel, Ursula) and you can't reach them until they spawn in a different location.
Personally, I would have enjoyed more challenges and areas to interact with. The portals are a bit naff as there is only a small space to go to and you can't explore or touch/collect items unless it's specific to the quest you're on. 
I think this game is great but considering it's Disney and relatively pricey, you'd probably expect more.

In terms of accessibility, you can play with a controller on PC which is always handy. The overall functions for each task isn't complicated so most actions can be done without intense button mashing.

I love Disney and grew up with the classics, so when I saw it on early access I bought the Ultimate Edition. However, I'm very disappointed in the publisher as a lot of early-on promises weren't kept (e.g. DLC Rift in Time being released as a separate item when content was supposed to be added to the base game). Similar to most if anything, the DLC should have been unlocked via Moonstones (in-game cash currency). What makes it worse is that the DLC is priced at the same amount as the Early Access Ultimate edition whereby the content is as much as the base game (imo should be priced as such not top-line premium price like Ultimate).

Story-wise:
I didn't feel very immersed as it eventually it gets to a just 'gather these and craft that' or 'run around for errands"" phase. Although, the main story 'The Forgetting' had to be my favourite because it was very relatable *not going into detail in case of spoiling*


Gameplay: 
I'm going to start with the big con here. That is after reaching the end-game where you've maxed out every NPCs friendship, all you have left is gathering to craft and working on achievements.

Imagine Stardew Valley but Disney-themed and minus the dungeons, monsters and fighting. One thing I loved was the variety of different characters and their houses. Another would be NPC specific gifts for raising their friendship. Lastly, it was quite love-hate when it came to the voices of NPCs, some were on point while others may have been off point but perhaps I'm just too used to the original voices from the movies.",1706690298,1706690619,False,12,0,0.620886325836181641,0,True,False,False

The storyline is easy to follow but there are also a ton of side-quests you can do with those apart of your village. I appreciate the max-level for everyone is Level 10, which makes grinding to level them up not as tedious. I thought it was very unique that you could assign a specific ""hobby"" to your villagers and hang out with them for bonus items + extra XP to also make leveling up beneficial. 

The cosmetics and furniture are adorable! The clothing is gender neutral so if you're character is a ""male"" you can wear dresses, and vice versa, which is great. 

Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and I'm excited there's a lot of side-quests to keep me busy so I don't feel the need to end the game. 

Suggestions for new players:

Looking back, I HIGHLY recommend not unlocking any extra villagers (in the castle) unless it's required by a quest and/or you have unlocked all of the biomes. Do not waste your dreamlight currency!!! I did this and found myself farming tasks for AGES and this was beyond tedious. 

Once you unlock Sunlit Plateau, there's a cave that can be entered. Whichever villager you have assigned for mining, this is so helpful in farming gems, gold, silver, etc. You can easily get a few thousand gold (more if you're extremely lucky) each turn. AND, IIRC, the rocks respawn every 5 minutes which makes farming amazing. 

Suggestions for DEVs:

Prevent holes (that have been dug) from disappearing. This is a tad frustrating when I'm trying to make a garden.. I shouldn't have to keep re-digging new plots.

Materials that are left on the ground should eventually be mailed back to us, instead of it just sitting on the ground. (WoW does this whenever you leave gear in dungeons). 

The collision can be improved on. I've found myself getting stuck on invisible boundaries whenever objects are near-by.

Allow us to give multiple gifts at once to villagers, rather than one at a time. This will make leveling up a villager less time-consuming. 

Some of the items in Scrooge's shop are really expensive?? IIRC, there was a dress for 40k? Sorry, that's way too expensive. These items should at least be obtainable without paying an arm and a leg.

There are some pay-to-win features that include but are not limited to purchased currency, as well as a battle pass. If you don't want to buy it, you don't have to. Pretty much everything is easily accessible without spending extra money.

It has got a few quirky things but very playable IMO.  It is a game where you can put in several hours and not notice the time go by. 

Edit as of 1/29/24
I had to change my recommendation to NO for this game.  The price for the game plus DLC or just the DLC are way too expensive for what you get.  I am waiting for a sale and would likely be a buyer at $15 for the DLC and a total price for the entire package would seem reasonable at about $45.  I still think it is a good game, just way overpriced for what you actually get.  It is also annoying that it still has in-app purchases given a AAA game price of $70.  Your entertainment dollars would go a lot further on some other game that is worthy of that pricing.

For the price, I feel like I got my money's worth already.  I went with the basic package and that felt right for me.  You are essentially paying the extra for the extras you can get with moonstones.  I looked them over and none of them really caught my eye and totally cosmetic...but a lot of the game can be decorating and detailing your village if you want that.

Additional edit:  Been playing for over 500 hours now.  Still very enjoyable game.  They added a monetized shop for buying cosmetics.  You can get along without anything in it but kind of pricey if you must have every gehgaw you see.

I did buy the Wall E bundle.  I believe it was like $14 to $15 dollars (in moonstones).  You get three quests and they are pretty good but I would put them in the sub $10 value.  You get a new outfit- but not my cup of tea so you would have to judge.  I had the excess moonstones to get it without additional purchase.  From my perspective, it is not worth paying additional but again, you will need to decide.  You can earn 50 moonstones every day by finding blue chests- how I ended up with excess moonstones.",1663835412,1706572237,False,0,0,0.751030921936035156,0,True,False,True

On top of that they launched a DLC as soon as it was out of early access, which is also very expensive. It is an extremely greedy move and I definitly wished I had not spend money buying it in the first place.

Quests are very fun and the time spent on decorating can be endless, you can decorate your Valley and homes to be unique to you. The custom fashion and furniture does need some work/variety but its a really nice feature that was implemented. If you like grindy games then this may be for you, my only issue is that it can take hours to make one item because of how little resources we get per drop.

[u]Some things to change[/u]
- I feel like Scrooges shop needs to be worked on, too many players don't have the majority of shop items due to rotation being poor, once we buy an item it shouldn't appear in the store again.
- Give players more clothing styles, cottage core, Alternative and [i]please[/i] add some Tights so when wearing skirts we aren't just bare legs.
- Please let us play old star paths, the game isn't going F2P anymore and it would be a great way to pass time in between events for those who have missed previous paths.
On to the Premium store, items should be reduced in price or the daily chest be increased to 100 Moonstones due to how often we have a Premium store reset with new items and paying $10-20+ a week on moonstones is not viable for most people.

TLDR: I highly recommend if you just like to switch off and have fun decorating while grinding levels and quests but it does come with issues that hopefully will be changed.",1706544401,1706544401,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Skip to the Pros/Con list if you want my opinion strictly on the game-play only.

I was a Disney kid. Raised by it, molded by it, and still watch some of their movies repetitively. I've got a whole Spotify list just for Disney songs. To say the least, I was excited for this game. I bought their mid-tier package (beyond the base game but not the $100 version), and played for several days straight. When they started cycling in season passes I grumbled a bit, but still didn't hesitate to reload my moonstones a few times to support I game I loved.

I thought I was getting a wonderful Disney adventure I would never tire of. Instead, I got sold a dish of pancakes and broken promises, with a side of bug salad for dessert. I can't be too mad Gameloft decided they were no longer going to release the game for free, since I had already paid for the game regardless. It's hard not to be upset though when they start locking important characters behind paid DLC when [i] the base game isn't even finished. [/i] Releasing paid, unfinished, DLC for an unfinished game that also has paywall locked quests [i] and [/i] a paid season pass every few months is just slimey. 

Poor development decisions aside, the game is [i] still [/i] in a poor enough state that I don't think I'd recommend anyone to pay to play it. The Disney licensing is the only thing this game has going for it, and if it didn't have Disney characters plastered all over it I guarantee everyone would put it down and go play sims or whatever other similar game you could get your hands on. A lot of people seem to make comparisons to animal crossing but honestly, I can't see the connection. If anything it's more like coral island met sims, but Disney.

ANYWAY on to the specific game stuff.

PROS:
-Obviously, it's Disney. You can talk to Wall-E, run around with Stitch, help Remy cook. It's great.
-Decorating your houses is pretty user friendly, and being able to place down multiple houses based on skins you have make it easy to decorate each zone based on a theme. 
-The main questline is really interesting, and opens up some good questions for teens to think about.
-Hopping through doors into mini versions of movie worlds is delightful.
-The Dreamsnaps feature is a neat way to encourage people to show of what they have and inspire/reward creativity. 

CONS: 
-Bugs. Everytime they 'fix' one bug, 2 more pop up in it's place. Games freezing, crashing. Important items disappearing, general lag and sputters. It's annoying to play for long periods in one sitting as the game gets buggier the longer you play.
-""Limited time"" quests that you'll never be able to play or get the items from if you don't find out about them early enough (I'm looking at you potato quest). 
-Since the game is real time based, you'll get blocked out of progressing for long periods of time as you wait for RNG events or for something to grow. This also means if you're an adult with a schedule and things to do, it'll be near impossible to select certain pets, as they only come out during certain times on certain days. Initially I thought they were all randomized, they are not.
-This one is petty, but I have to put up with Mother Gothel, the biggest monster in Disney (most villains I can find at least something to sympathize with them over, not Gothel), but I can't meet our precious bean Rapunzel. At least give us Flynn as a ""Villain"" he'd be more fun.
-All the characters just repeat various quotes (or worse, random puns) based on their movie. There is no dimension, or personality, beyond their very very basic movie roles. With this level of intractability, I honestly may as well just watch their movie. There are only so many times I can listen to the same quote in the same emotionless monotone.
-Plot holes. Eric and Ariel already know each other well enough to at least be dating, but you have to complete a series of quests to earn Ariel her legs.... that she should already have knowing Eric? It feels like this completely contradicts their complete lack of personality from my previous point. Are you going to follow their lore or not? Don't even get me started on Beauty and the Beast....

There's probably more I could think about for both the good and bad things, but I feel like I'm just ranting at this point so I'll leave it. Overall though, Game loft had an amazing opportunity here, and they have completely butchered it. I enjoyed this game for the time I've put into it, but going back in time I definitely would have put less money into it.

[i]Despite how cliché its story is down to the twist one can read coming a mile away, I don't believe the game suffers for it, because although predictable, it makes fun choices.[/i]

ACNH makes it look like a technological marvel in comparison. For one, I don't have to wait days between moving buildings, nor do I have to pull items out of storage for crafting. It also has actual fast traveling outside of the two locations the Mario tube allows in ACNH. It has so many QoL improvements that hopefully its existence serves as a good rival for Nintendo to motivate them towards improving their frankly obsolete mechanics in the next Animal Crossing installment.

Customizable controls go a long way. I hope they add it in the future. I also hope they allow us to upgrade chests without taking the items out, removing the chest, putting the better version down, then returning the items, if better chests get released. Given how many items I now hoard, that would be an absolute pain, but going past 2 lines might be worth the hassle! x'D

As with all Early Access titles, it is up to a given person whether or not they wish to try a game before release. For me, this has become my latest obsession, thanks to its relaxing gameplay, charming characters (especially Wall-E whom I had no idea could be this cute *^*), and cross-saves/progression, which incentivised me to buy it on multiple platforms, but it is not without its issues, even when played on the Switch. Its FAQ also states that it will go free-to-play at release, so the price of entry basically just gets you crashes and other bugs along with nebulous ""exclusive content that won't be available after release.""

In my humble opinion, at this stage, it's an easy 8/10. Buy it if the things you hear about it allure you. If the aforementioned plans to go free-to-play turn you off, then that is more than understandable, but if you do decide to get into it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Cheers!

Edit: They went back on their plans to go free-to-play. Unfortunate. Not even gonna excuse it. I am happy that multi-player is coming together. It's motivating me to play more, if only to farm stuff for new players.",1673302332,1705889927,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,True

I wasn't there during the F2P fiasco, so not including that.
This game is what I had assumed, a paid game, meaning you paid one time and play it, with maybe occasional dlc.
Turns out, it's a F2P model. Has battle pass, premium shop and additional 'quests' that is locked behind paywall.
Again, I absolutely do not recommend it whatsoever. Game functions on real time, a tad similar to animal crossing.
As much as how disappointing Animal Crossing New Horizon was compared to its predecessor, this game compared to AC is horrid. Not including the whole garbage premium crap (also expensive).
Ex. In game quest, rainy weather only spawn certain fish, but that fish is required for progress in a QUEST. it's not optional. and rainy weather is RNG. This was one of the main breaking point for me, I would be okay if it's just for collection, but to proceed in a quest?! I wanted to remove the bones & giant ice chunk, but can't due to the rainy fish related quests. I hate Animal Crossing for their stupid ""extend gameplay"" mechanic for crafting one thing at a time and can't skip cutscene. But this really takes the cake.
Another, there is a stamina bar, you can replenish via cooking, but if you're trying to grow crops (this again, is real time based duration), it's not fun whatsoever. You can sorta get around in remy's realm(exploit). But it's still not fun at all. And the crops need monitoring and to keep them water.
The characters' realm is very lackluster and sad, there's absolutely nothing else in there aside from the fact that you're there to just get the characters out. That's it.
All the charm that even the disappointment Animal Crossing has, this one doesn't at all. There's no freedom in what you want to do, and instead, locked into RNG for quests that unlock important perks.",1705864602,1705864602,False,7,0,0.525142908096313477,0,True,False,False

Yes the game has some of the same things like, fishing, farming, mining, and decorating your valley. But this game is more quest driven than Animal Crossing.

Moonstones: Disney Dreamlight Valley IRL Game Money that you have to buy for the Premium Star Path and Premium Shop for the items like House Skins, clothing, animal skins, and etc (and some of them are way overpriced). You do get moonstones inside game for free but its not a lot.

Playing since EA, took a few breaks because like ACNH, when you play too much of it you get a burn out, which made me miss a few Star Path (''Battle Passes''), i wish i could get some of the items from them. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2951475112

The game is fun and well designed, it gives you enough of both good part of the ''farming'' and ''decorating'', you can just have fun making money and run around doing quests and making your game as worth as much or decorate like a mad house designer (there is literally more than 10 levels of rooms in your main house and you can have a few of thems around with base 4 rooms inside). And of course decorate the whole world as you want. 

They also added weekly challenges now, where you can participate with a theme and vote for people who participated aswell, it gives you rewards (moonstones, items and such), which is very fun esp if you are not too competitive and just happy to participate (because it can be a bit frustrating when you get ''only'' 300 moonstones, when you know the 1st can get up to 12k lmao). 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3113845658

They also added Touch of Magic (can't be used for challenges tho), which make you able to decorate your very own items on a blank canvas. It is very fun to do and sometimes takes quite the time to get what you wish for, they offer a load of little designs from galaxies to goofy doing goofy things to decorate both your items and clothings.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3120204400

In a general state, the game is fun and all. But obviously there is always a bit of a down side.
Since DLC release there is bugs running around (not literally please), that can remove your dreamlights currencies, make you lose some progress and such, i haven't personally run into such stuff but seeing steam forums and their discords, people get into them often.

There is also the in game shop, which can be controversal towards the audience, since Disney is ''made for childrens'' and the game is a paid game, with a paid DLC AND also a in game shop. 
I'd say, to me, who is a weakling for housing items, the shop is pretty fine if you can handle more or less your wallet (or don't let your kids get into your credit card lol). They give you enough in game currencies for free to allow you to buy shop items often. (50 moonstones per day, 50 moonstones by voting for the weekly challenges and depending of your perf, you get moonstones for your weekly challenge, there is others meanings but there are more or less often than those). 


To end this, i guess review.
I indeed recommend this game, for people who actually enjoy Disney (because you CAN'T get rid of your villagers you don't like, just hide them once you're done with their quests, but their houses are still there). But if you don't mind them and enjoy crafting, gathering, doing quests and decorating, the game offers many things to make you happy.

If you doubt, eventually, wait a sale, it is always the best way to make ''your money worth''.",1679182468,1705672063,True,6,0,0.595779716968536377,1,True,False,False

I still stand by the premium store being extremely overpriced, and that's one thing that needs to change. Newer premium store items do have a more premium look and feel to them, which minimally makes up for the price of the items. 

With the last 2 updates there have been major improvements to the game play itself, with the DLC adding a lot of new content that is helpful in managing the more tedious tasks of the game. The variety in characters is improving also, and I'm finding myself playing more consistently like I did prior to the introduction of the premium shop. 

I have changed my mind from not recommending this game, as I feel it is currently in a better state, for fans of Disney and the cozy farming game genre. If you do not like both of these things, I still would not recommend this game to you. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW: DO NOT buy this game! Wait for it to go free to play. Gameloft is treating their PAYING early access beta test players horribly. With the introduction of the premium store the quality of this game deteriorated very quickly. I PAID to play Early Access and Gameloft is charging ridiculous amounts of money in their premium shop. Gameloft's reasoning is ""testing out the pricing"". If they want to test out premium store pricing than early access needed to be FREE. This game had so much potential and Gameloft has basically shut down all communication with the early access community, they aren't dealing with the premium shop issues and it's been nearly 3 weeks at this point. Until this is remedied I will not be recommending this game.",1677896795,1705625926,True,0,0,0.630241692066192627,0,True,False,True

It's entertaining (and Wall-E is really cute!!).

The shop is expensive but they added a contest in which you can win a lot of currency depending on your score so that's a nice way to save moonstones and purchase stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game is nice. Pretty close to Animal Crossing.
Keep in mind the game will be free to play next year and right now it has several bugs (tho I think they're working on them at a good pace), so just purchase it if you want to play it right NOW or don't wanna miss the exclusive items you get with each founder's pack.

After playing my first event pass (I wasn't around for the Pixar one), I can say they seem pretty healthy, you have plenty of time to complete them and the missions are doable. I would say it's ok to purchase the premium pass, because you are able to get everything in them. I don't like it when you get a pass and have to pick and chose your rewards because there's not enough time (or points) to get everything you like, and right now you're able to convert your exceeding points into moonstones!

Pros: 
-Game is very relaxing
-A decent amount of content, although can be rushed through
-A lot of original voice actors for a lot of the townies
-Game looks pretty
-A lot of activities like mining, fishing, foraging, farming etc (some more enjoyable than others)
-Wall-E (precious baby, must protec)
-As of right now all townies are free and aren't hidden behind paywalls alltho it was mentioned that after the release of the game, there will be characters added that will be behind paywalls.

Cons: 
-Base game WILL NOT be free (as it was promised in the beginning)
-Minnie's clocktower grind
-Too few voice lines for townies (gets really annoying after a while hearing [spoiler] Donald's choo choo train [/spoiler] or looking at [spoiler] Maui flexing [/spoiler] )
-Lack of replayable content that is enjoyable or any kind of ""end game"" (understandable due to being in Early Access at the time of the and might actually implement content with replay value at some time)
-Restrictive decorative system (can't change doors, house exterior and room layout but also can't change interior for townie houses)
-RNG based acquisition of fashion pieces and furniture which makes customization tedious (looking at you Scrooge) [spoiler] but also THOSE 3 LAMPS darn it [/spoiler]!!!
-Easily able to rush through the content after a few days (excluding a few missions that are time-locked)
-Toxic community, if you wish to join the Discord server, don't, the mods are authoritarian, there are too many rules and they will impose rules on you that wont affect just your server presence and activity but they will also dog pile on you and wont give time to defend your case. 
-Battle Pass system (Star Path)

All in all, game is solid, it's really fun BUT it definitely needs a lot more work put into in it.

Anyone who has played (and enjoyed) the likes of Kingdom Hearts (1, 2 or 3) or Epic Mickey (1 or 2), will know exactly what to expect from Dreamlight Valley.  For that matter, it is a Disney title, everyone knows what to expect!

So, on cue Mickey Mouse appears right near the start of the game, to help you solve some catastrophe that has rendered the universe beset by evil badness.  In this case, mysterious thorny vines, controlled by the mysterious 'Forgotten' which is allegorically synonymous with your lost childhood.  You will work your way through many, many quests, while gathering resources and making friendships, all the time working toward freeing Dreamlight Valley and it's denizens from the Forgotten.

Dreamlight Valley is regularly updated with new areas to explore, and new characters to befriend, and of course new quests.  There is also a sizeable DLC that adds whole new dimensions to the game, and all that entails, adding maybe 50% to the overall game content.

If you have a spare 500 hours or so, then this game is fun, enjoyable and rewarding.  If you can afford it, then get the DLC too.  There is so much to this game that you will keep coming back for more.

Now for the negatives...

Multiplayer is a joke.  Players can visit your island, but not only can they not interact with anything, but also YOU are prevented from interacting with anything while your world is open for friends to join.  You cannot open chests, or even leave the area you are in, you cannot even enter the Castle.  You can share resources by dropping them on the floor for your friend to pick up and take back to their world, BUT only if you have the foresight to take them out of your storage chests BEFORE you enable multiplayer mode.

Secondly, the only bug gripe I have is that occasionally, you get 'stuck' running, usually into an object or doorway, and when this happens you can't even press escape to leave the game to rejoin.  You must exit using Windows Task Manager.  This is not a frequent thing, but has happened enough in my roughly 350 hours of gameplay (maybe half-a-dozen times) that it is frustrating every time...

This is mostly going to be a mess of a review, just stating things I like and issues I might have so do not expect a well thought out masterpiece of a review LOL.

I REALLY love this game. It's easy, it's relaxing and I really enjoy the narrative of the actual story. For the real time aspect, sometimes I do like having a set time for each in game day (Stardew, Coral Island, etc), but sometimes I feel too rushed so I enjoy the real time function of Dreamlight. I like that this game is easy to jump right back into if you've taken a bit of a break, too.

-There is SO MUCH content in this game. Like, seriously, A LOT. And they keep adding characters and quests, main story lore and whatnot. I haven't gotten the DLC yet as I write this, but I plan to once I finish up things I still have in the base game (which is a lot). In terms of things being grindy, I don't really feel like it's that bad. I think early game might be a little more grindy mostly because you don't have much materials yet, but even then it didn't even feel that bad. You do not have to rush this game at all unless you want to, and you can take things at your own pace. Some quests do take longer since some things require actual IRL days to pass, but I don't mind personally.
-I love the customization this game offers. I love that you can decorate each different area however you like. I love decorating and building each biome differently, and there are really so many possibilities for any vision you might have and many different aesthetics you can go with.
-I already said I enjoyed the main story line, but I genuinely really like it. It's surprisingly deep and meaningful, and very touching in many ways. I think it's nice to have a story that has this kind of emotional depth for younger kids who can play this, but it's also great for adults (I say this as a 25yr old lo
-Micro transactions. I am used to them by now since so many games have them, but I will say the price of things in the in-game shop are overpriced. Obviously you do not need to buy anything from the in-game shop in order to play or experience the game, but it would be nice if the in-game moonstone prices in the shop would be lowered especially since the Free to Play aspect is gone as of now
- I really enjoy the Star Paths. I wish you didn't have to pay to access them though. You don't HAVE to as there are free tiers of items on each page and you can access some activities to get tokens for them, but to get the cooler stuff you do need to by the pass for them with moonstones.
-I think with the addition of the Dreamsnaps challenges, it is a lot easier to get moonstones now each week in addition to the 50 you get each day by opening the chests in game. I think it REALLY helps people who don't have the money to buy in game currency, and i've seen a lot of people happy about this addition as it provides a good amount of moonstones to people with minimal effort. I think it is a good addition and I hope we can see more things like this in the future. 

And now I will mention how I feel about the Free to Play change.

Personally it doesn't affect me at all. I already bought the game multiple times, so I own it on multiple platforms. I don't need to buy it again. I understand the disappointment people have about Gameloft not making it free to play currently. Though it could change again in the future. When you are promised something that like, and it gets changed it doesn't feel great. And people have a right to be angry about it. Though I don't think leaving a negative review solely because of this change is warranted. There are other things to critique about the game, it just seems a bit petty even though I do understand peoples anger.
But I will say, I genuinely think this game is worth paying for if you are able. There is so much content, and so much to do that I think the standard edition being 40 dollars is worth it to me. Obviously everyone has there own opinions, feelings and financial abilities though. I think the standard edition could be lowered to at least 30 dollars though. I still think it's worth the price for everything you get and all the content it has to offer, but since the DLC is currently 30 dollars too I think pricing get's a bit messy and too much with so many things. I cannot speak to the DLC as I have not played it yet, but I plan to get it in the future. 30 dollars is a bit much for DLC in my opinion, I would lower it to 20 dollars max. But I have heard really great things from people who have it, and I have heard there is a lot of content within the DLC. Time will tell for whenever I get it and go through it, but I am more iffy on the DLC being 30 dollars than I am about the standard base game being 40 dollars.

TLDR; I think what the game has to offer and the content it provides, and the quality of it is worth paying for. Though, I do think it is still a bit overpriced for some things (The DLC and Gold edition, along with moonstone store prices).
I am excited to see how this game grows and changes, and listens to player feedback. My thoughts and opinions can always change too.

I'm not seeing this issue as of today.  However, I am seeing repeats at McDuck's shop, even though I only have 49% of the furniture unlocked.  Note that I do not have the expansion yet, as I was trying to work my way through the original game, first.  I grow a ton of pumpkins, so I can hit up Scrooge's shop daily for everything present.  Yet, just today there was only one item in the shop I'd yet to buy (nothwithstanding the table along the right staircase), which is the first time in the past _four days_ when I saw something brand new.  Again: I am buying everything in there daily; clearing it out; empty; 'there are no longer mannequins in the front windows and haven't been for months' I have bought so much of it.

I'm having trouble seeing what the point is in logging on daily if there's nothing actually updating daily?

Still not a firm recommend, but if you can get it for a tenner, it'll kill some time.

The expensive Premium shop added into this game didn't help and the 'A Festival of Friendship' (Disney 100 event) didn't last for a year or at least 2 1/2 months is a huge disappointment, even though Gameloft gave you time for it at the time.

For example Honkai Impact 3rd's 5th Anniversary event lasts more than 2 months and it is better!  I didn't experience A Festival of Friendship event at all, so it is a huge disappointment. Since I've a full time job and get distracted from other games and overlook sometimes.

Now, if a upcoming Animal Crossing that has improved game-play and content updates without the expensive micro transactions, then the latest AC will beat Disney Dreamlight Valley ten times over!!

Time to go back to the Sims 2 with mods and the Sims 4 with mods!

The game itself is really buggy, you are forced to quit the game nearly in every game session, dont matter how long you play. 
Playing half an hour? Well, here, have two bugs. Playing three hours? Good, you're getting 12 bugs. You want to play the game the whole day? Hell, yes, make a bug-festival out of it and quit the game several times! 
And it's not only one certain bug, but different kinds, all forcing you to quit the game with the x in the corner. 
And don't let me getting started on the visual bugs or the character bugs ot the bugs when decorating your house etc.  
These bugs are known since early access and aren't fixed at all, not even tried to fix them.

Ingame you also have a premium-pass thingie, which you dont have to use, but yeah... often nice looking stuff is behind the premium pass and not in the regular one. 

Quests from the dreamlight or the event line are often so unclear as to what you have to do with whom, that I always have to look it up with google. 

It's definitely not worth its price and the DLC is also (in my opinion) a really nasty way to get people to buy it. Because there are many characters in it, which you only get if you buy the DLC and also many quests you get in the event or the dreamlight line are to do things in the DLC.

UPDATE: I just saw, that many achievements have zero progress in it although I do have several things from them at least at 10%. So the achievements are obviously also bugged. 

UPDATE 2: And although I have 5 out of 5 Internet, it often say's ""No connection"" and has other Errors. Each Time I start the Game, there are more and more Issues. 

I would reccomend the Devs to fix the Game instead of giving out new ones ...

For an almost full-priced game, DDV is too buggy for my liking. There are quite a bit of common ""quality of life"" features that this game also lacks. While the game isn't as streamlined as one would expect, it does boast a lot of content. At its heart, DDV is a game about decorating your valley, your home, and yourself. There are a ton of items to gain that you unlock through Scrooge's store, befriending disney characters, and through finding daily treasure chests throughout the valley.

Interacting with all the Disney characters is fun and enjoyable but the story is what you would expect from Disney. It's very shallow and focuses on the power of positivity, friendship, love, happiness, and kindness.

Multiplayer as it currently stands is very lacking and serves little purpose outside of being able to visit another players valley to see their decor and perhaps purchase anything leftover in the Scrooge's store.

PROS:
- The game boasts a ton of decorations and clothes. It is nearly unlimited in its ability to decorate around the village and within your house. It's quite a robust system and possibly the star of the game. There are also a ton of clothing options that allow you to really customize your character, and is possibly one of the best character dress up games currently out there.

- It's a Disney game that is really fun, has a lot of content, lots to do, and dozens of Disney characters to interact with and befriend.

- The game has a ton of different activities from fishing, foraging, farming, cooking, mining, quests, and decorating. As time goes on, Disney does updates with introduction to new characters and other themed events (like holiday events) with special items.

CONS:
- Too glitchy & buggy. A lot of players (including myself) have complained about lag issues and occasional CTD despite having appropriate computer hardware specs for the game. The game definitely is not as stable as it should be.

- Missing a lot of ""quality of life"" features. Sort in storage boxes does not work and is glitchy. Lots of activities (cooking, selling, etc) require a lot of menu surfing and button spamming. There is no latency between button-smash activities and activating whatever is in the way (for example, golden light spam farming automatically cuts into planting seeds at its end with no latency). The level cap of 40 is easily reached making quests obsolete (as 95% of quests only offer level exp as a reward). Characters reach max level within a couple of hours of play and offer nothing beyond max level, which also makes crafting meals at Remy's shop for the characters dining obsolete.  

- Do not look forward to the worlds you go into to get new characters. They are not like the main valley and hold no purpose outside of being a (in most cases) single room where you perform fetch-quests for the Disney character until they are finally willing to join your valley. Once you have the character join the valley, there is no point to ever return to their world as it offers nothing.

- Multiplayer offers very little at the moment. Nothing more than a way to see a friend's valley in person.

- This may not be a con for everyone, but the stories in DDV (Disney character stories and main quest stories alike) were way too kiddy-pool shallow for me. It was far too happy-go-lucky and felt geared toward a very young audience of perhaps 10 year olds. While I was originally following along with all the stories, I eventually reached a point where I realized how shallow and one-dimensional it all was, losing interest entirely.

If you do decide to buy the game keep in mind that you're basically paying money to playtest a free game. A closed beta where the key to open it is your money.

So why did I buy the game? No idea. Didn't want to wait for the release and now I just can't give it back.
 It's addicting as hell. If you like Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley kinda games, played some Animal Crossing and watched any Disney movie, you'll lovethis as well.

Don't get me wrong, there are currently LOTS of bugs and this game (more so the paid EA, Ultimate Edition, Founders Pack) is a huge cashgrab/cashcow but-..i can't think of a proper ""but"". 
It's just fun. It's cute. It's simple. It'll only have cosmetics for cash in the final game, which is fine and reasonable.

Get it. Or don't. I won't judge. Maybe a little bit. Because you're either making the same mistake I did by buying a free game or miss out on a really nice game.


Edit: 
Guess I have to take back my words on how they plan to only monetize on cosmetics. I surely had hopes but oh well. They hide complete questlines behind pay-walls. 
I *could* understand if it were just event questlines for halloween or other seasonal events; but character/lore related questlines is questionable at least. 

To be fair, i havent played alot in between my rewiev and this edit. They fixed a lot of bugs but also added a few. 
The roadmap looks promising (multiplayer?!) an yes, I'm sad my fav Disney characters are still not added but come on, there are so many. Somebody WILL complain, always. 

However I am a bit mad about having to invite everyone. I didn't want to invite certain characters to my town bc I don't vibe with them, but I had no choice as I needed them to progress another character's quest. A little bit more individuality would be nice in this regards

I don't want to change to ""do not recommend"" yet. I can't tell you why. I had fun, certainly. The publisher or whoever made these descicions is greedy (oh surprise) and already filling this EA(!) game with questionable pay-content. All this after earning quite a lot of money from selling this free(!) game and saving lots of money on playtesting and quality control. Lets not forget that. 

Instead of paying people to playtest and find bugs, they let us pay them,  let us be QC. 
Sure, you'll never know what kinda shenanigans the user/player gets up to that leads to bugs, sure. But c'mon. At release day, you couldn't even use your inventory properly. One of the first things you use. Every player uses their inventory. And you tell me your team could not find that bug before releasing this game to EA?
Smells a lot like ""idc how stable that game is, release it now, we need the funds"" + minimizing the QC-Team + unrealistic deadlines + crunch culture
And i certainly don't recommend that.

I'm currently playing with a trainer/cheat engine to mildy enhance my fun. Because certain things just feel way to much like work and not like fun/gaming. And let me tell you I love me a good grind. But theres no game around the grind sometimes. I have a thousand stacks of produce but like 20 pieces of earth or sand and need like 2000? I've been shoveling whole areas of my town to get like nothing. So, i recommend you a trainer to alter your game experience

TL;dr: If you can handle some jank on what should be a bit more polished by now, and you like Disney and this genre of game, you'll probably enjoy this game. Be sure to join the discord. 

Okay, now the bricks:
I want to say that, when it's working, this is a fun cozy farm simulator with a lot of nice nonviolent and sometimes rather clever quests to work through, of course with many classic Disney characters. It really is fun to play and engaging for the base price. When it works (and when you aren't feeling upset by significant microtransactions in an already not-free-to-play game, or the fact that the devs sort of went back on their promise to have all characters from the finished game be available to everyone at no additional cost), this is an enjoyable, though certainly not groundbreaking game. The graphics are fine, the interface is decent, and the characters are generally fun, if quite superficial and a bit repetitive. The music and sounds can get a little repetitive and annoying, but this has gotten better with updates. More recently and rather importantly, there are some features for being truly creative with customizing certain types of clothing and furniture. There's also a strong and supportive community of other users in the game's discord. 

The game is pretty freshly out of early access and the devs are very active. So far the road map for new content has been good, and some bugs have been squished in a timely manner. In some ways the devs seem responsive, and this certainly isn't abandonware. Unfortunately, if you do have an issue and report it and it doesn't immediately end up on the road map, that responsiveness falls short. I personally lost access to the cloud save feature for several weeks, with no indication of whether this was common bug or one that will ever get fixed. As I poked around other bug reports, I noticed I was not alone in having a serious issue that went unacknowledged for a significant amount of time. Having an issue go unfixed for some period is one thing: I understand dev teams are busy. Having major issues from multiple people over several weeks simply not be recognized on a product that is still being worked on implies some serious problems with how Gameloft is running this project. Ultimately, as far as I know, the game was not ""fixed"" and it took me switching internet providers (which I did for other reasons) to finally resolve the issue even though someone (not a dev) on discord had done some major debugging and basically told the team what the problem is. 

All that happened before the two extensions were offered for moonstone (technically available in-game but practically a paid add-on) and a DLC equal to the price of the base game was added on to more or less circumvent the promise made by Gameloft that the full content of the game would be available to anyone who purchased before the official ""full"" release. The DLC irks me, but to be a little fair, it is a truly significant expansion of the game. Still, I personally am tired of getting my chain yanked and am waiting on the DLC and any more real money purchases of moon stones for now.",1695396874,1703756944,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ok so the caricter stuff is a little messy, how is the quests...they are repetitive and predictable, so much so, when I get a new quest I can tell you what they will want, just not how much of each item they will want, they rely on the amount to keep you busy not the diversity of the items and things to do.

How is the story? it is basic and quite frankly, lazy, it is predictable and there is so much wasted potential, I wont spoil anything (granted there really isnt anything to spoil) but caricters like Simba was so boring and a MASSIVE PAIN and Bell and The Beast was just a sad attempt at trying to make me care, not to meantion they did the EXZACT SAME THING with Mowie and Moana.

The pay wall needs a hole new section, if you want to make your home or your caricters to look a little different it costs money, you want good decorations? costs money, You want more quests? costs money, You want new tools? costs money, YOU WANT PROMISED TO BE FREE CARICTERS? IT COSTS MONEY. I dont want to pay more money for what they promised would be free.

Now I will give it SOME credit about the way the game looks, it looks really good BUT your computer will not be able to run it at max (this could be just my computer but my peeps where having the same problem) and this is a minor complaint, if your camera gets to close to ANYTHING, it wont de-render the thing, it just wont let you see though it, you have to move your camera around to see around items (this includes and is not limited to, Buildings, Decorations, and the most annoying one TREES).

Sure, the early access fee is a bit steep, but hey, they throw in the whole ""future free-to-play"" thing to calm our nerves.

But then, bam! Reality check hits like a ton of bricks. The in-game store prices are out of control, like they want me to mortgage my house for a virtual skin that costs a whopping 30 bucks! What happened to the whole free-to-play dream they sold us on? Now they're acting like we're supposed to cough up serious cash just to unlock some characters. It's like they took our trust, threw it in a blender, and hit puree.

Remember how they promised the free-to-play magic within the first year of early access? Well, that ship has sailed, my friend. Now they're shaking us down for a minimum of 30 smackers, making us pay for their expansion greed. Disney, you're not fooling anyone with your corporate tricks. The game I was so stoked about has turned into a disappointment parade.

And don't even get me started on the devs. Communication? What's that? It's like they went silent, leaving us in the dark about what the heck is going on. Makes you wonder if they're playing games with us or if they've just lost their way in the enchanted forest of transparency.

So, there you have it, folks. My once joyful anticipation has taken a nosedive into the abyss of profound letdown. Thanks a lot, Gameloft. You owe me some virtual magic to make up for this mess.",1667223886,1703720772,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

It really is well made and produced, really good graphics, structure and vibe.

As far as I can tell, no microtransations are essential to progress the game, which is expansive and always branching - there is always something to do; a new challenge, a favour for a friend, checking up on something your working on..... so a very fulfilling game offering good playtime value, as long as you don't have a Disney problem.

I have tried anything and everything to get online so I can access my cloud data from my Switch and Steam Deck however, the desktop version refuses to connect. When reaching out to Gameloft for support, all they say is ""did you update the game and steam"". Instead of reading my issue and my through notes on what I've tried to resolve it (which included reinstalling and verify steam was updated PRIOR to contacting Gameloft). The ONLY way I can connect on my desktop is with a phone hotspot which is RIDICULOUS. I never knew how to do something like this prior to this issue. I have tried every forum, game update, and discord I can find and there is no solution. 

Additionally, I have multiple issues occuring that have no solution or response from Gameloft. When I am able to get in (aka on steam deck, switch, or hotspot on desktop) the game freezes randomly when doing any type of action from gathering, talking to characters, and more. I've seen that this is a more wide spread issue. What's weird about these freezes is that I can still control the camera, watch things happen, and miss out on critical timed events (like the new time bubble mechanics). 

This game is broken, buggy, and not worth spending money on. I'm uninstalling this game on desktop for now but I hope that these bugs get fixed however, given that this is pretty on par for the developer, I doubt there is any hope in getting these issues resolved. 

As a day one player this has been an utter slap in the face, even though the free to play promise went away, those who loved the game stuck around and this is the service we are PAYING for. Disappointing, I was hoping gamers finally had an Animal Crossing competitor to finally broaden out the real-time daily life simulation genre.

Originally F2P, now a pay to play with an abhorrent amount of F2P mechanics including several premium or grind able currencies, characters which were previously promised not to be locked behind a paywall now locked behind a $30 unfinished DLC paywall, and a cosmetic shop with prices reflective of an MMORPG Cash Shop.

I cannot in good conscience recommend this game anymore as it embodies too many broken promises, the rug pulled from beneath founders in terms of the game being F2P, and generally costing more then a SIMS game plus packs.

You pay for the game and then have dlc to buy if you want to have more content (which you will want). I bought early access with the knowledge that this game was going to be f2p and it was the only reason I was okay with micro-transactions. Although, I should've known this was how it was going to go. It is disney after all. They always do this now. Toonown, Club Penguin, their various miscellaneous mobile games....but at least they were free (minus physical copies of Toontown). A part of me wishes they still did games like that princess one on the wii and their ds games.

As much as I wish this game was what it was meant to be and that it wasn't riddled with terrible practices - it isn't. I truly love disney characters and the idea of getting to know them and hangout is so very nice. Unfortunately, that is also bare bones and you barely have things to do that allow you to connect with them. This is more of a personal ""something I was hoping for"", but I was curious to see if they'd bring back old characters like Oswald and Ortensia, heck even Pete. They haven't and it doesn't seem like they will, but with how they seem to connect all their games in some way - I couldn't help but hope. Which is my own fault for doing so.

I recommend not getting this game and instead looking at other games similar to it such as story of seasons, stardew valley, or even coral island. Unless you're fine with money grubbing and predatory systems.
However, if you just want to see your favorite characters and experience the story, then you should play this game. I do find joy in seeing Donald Duck go bonkers even with all that I've said.

We were promised that no characters would be behind a paywall, and currently Rapunsel and Gaston are behind a paywall.

If you're interested in the base+DLC option you should know the rift in time DLC is scheduled to have two updates leaving the DLC somewhat incomplete till summer 2024. I would only recommend picking the game up on sale.

I started playing week 2 of early access and have put roughly 400 hours into this game across steam and xbox. The game has changed a lot over time and I expect it will continue to change despite being out of early access.

Premium currency moonstones:
Personally I don't think paid games should have a premium currency however DDV has made it possible to earn tons of moonstones in a fun way with weekly dreamsnaps. I have been able to use my earned moonstones to collect any premium item or star path I have wanted. If you're not interested in decorating I don't think you'll like this aspect of the game and may miss out on heaps of moonstones however anyone who enters a dreamsnap will automatically receive 300 moonstones the following week.

Premium Shop:
As stated before I have never had sny issue being able to obtain any item I wanted in the shop. I do think the shop itself needs an overhaul. As of right now the shop rotates 4 items each week. I think it would be preferable if they offered more items if not all items. 

Free to play:
Many complaints have come out about Gamelofts decision to backtrack on FTP. Personally I think this is the better outcome for the game as other disney licensed games produced by Gameloft have been FTP mobile games that over time have turned into pay to win games.

Gameplay:
There is a main story with lots of text. Overall the story is well written and cohesive however it can be overwhelming for people who have a hard time focusing on so much dialog. All of the characters we have gotten so far (30) look fantastic and have dialog that sounds natural for each character. 

You get to do the typical farming sim tasks mining, fishing, planting, and cleaning up the valley. At this point there is no combat in the game. Majority of the tasks you do for the villagers are fetch quests. Ultimately the game shines in the design mode where you decorate your valley.

Cross platform:
The game offers cloud save across pc, Xbox, and Nintendo switch. You can also share youre base game with family sharing. 
If you purchase the DLC you will not have access to the DLC island unless purchased on each platform. DLC is also account specific which means if you're sharing base game with family they will not have access to your DLC this in my opinion is my biggest issue with the game so far.

Other:
The game will continue to get free updates that will include new characters. At this point we have a rode map for the first half of the 2024 year. 

The game still has bugs and with every big update we receive we get fixes as well as new bugs. 

It is clear the developers are fans of disney as you can see designs and items ripped straight out of beloved disney movies from all years.

It's also clear the developers have been listening to their players as they've added and changed many things players have asked for. Though not always in the best / simplest ways.

I don't think Gameloft is a trustworthy company and they do not communicate. They withhold information as long as possible as we've seen with FTP and the recent DLC which they waited nearly 1 hour after launch to communicate that the DLC would be account specific.",1702994429,1702994429,True,19,1,0.694281101226806641,0,True,False,False

Oh, though I will say they do seem to give quarterly or so ""worlds"" to unlock new characters. But these worlds are pretty small and are finished quickly so you never go back to them. Though they were always like this to begin with, so I suppose that's on me for expecting more outside of DLCs. 

I got this when it released in EA. I played up until the main story finishes on the main island. I won't be buying the expansion DLC. It's not a bad game, but it'll get boring over time unless you're really into Disney, really into decorating and redecorating your land, or you find the constant foraging, mining, or fishing to be fun. 

I enjoyed the novelty of the game at first. It was so nostalgic, the music is nice, the characters interacting were cute, and I loved being a part of the story. The rescue mission to save others, the unlocking of new areas and the (predictable) twist as you complete the main story,  were fun. Then once that is done, I was bored. I stopped playing and only returned to use up my currency. Money is also no issue. Just plant pumpkins and BAM, you're rich. 

There seems to be a finite amount of items that can be found in Scrooge's store. I think so you pay to get their dream passes for the themed items? But those don't run all the time and only have so many items available. I did the Halloween one to use up my currency I got with my EA bundle, but I have no desire to actually spend money on them. But for a game that's secondary focus is decoration, it's a bit sad you will hit a wall if you don't want to unlock and grind the dream....pass route? (I forget the name.) 

A plus is that you can participate in the weekly (i think) dreamsnap to get some currency. That is nice, but not enough to keep me since even that is a bit annoying with the camera controls. It fights me constantly and one wrong scroll and BAM I'm in the sky or in another land. 

Oh, and if you're redecorating your whole island, be sure to exit frequently so it can save. For some reason, if I do a lot without exiting the editing screen, it doesn't record all my changes. I have no idea how to tell when it's unable to record additional changes so I've quit redecorating several times when it decides I've gotten a bit too ambitious for it's memory limits.",1702969382,1702969382,False,2,0,0.52693486213684082,0,True,False,False

Im not quite 100% done with the base game BUT it has a lot of good stuff to sink your teeth into.

it is fairly grindy, so if you dont like that, then it may not be the game for you.
I dont like that there isnt a grid system when it comes to editing/furnishing purposes Especially since the game is really finicky when it comes to this portion of the game.

Ai is annoyingly atrocious when it comes to always be on your way when youre hanging out with them.

The mini games are pretty simple and nothing hard at all to go into.

I wish there was a refresh at least on Scrooges shop, that way theres more room to get stuff that you want for your rooms and outside decor.
Aside that the game focuses a lot on your creativity in the layout of the town and its most fun starting all the construction from scratch at least thats how i focused it.

Edit: With the new DLC, there are considerable more bugs. I haven't come across any game breaking bugs, but some do definitely hinder progress. One small area is completely inaccessible to me. I still highly recommend the game but there are always new bugs with every update and this one happens to have the most bugs.",1701496246,1702777408,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have always assumed that games with a free-to-play economy are profitable alternatives for companies who don't want to sell games up front and keep releasing DLCs thereafter. This seemed like a cool business model for DDV, so I kept playing.

But then Disney/Gameloft started releasing full-priced DLCs for Disney Dreamlight, while retaining the perks of a free-to-play game, (their in-game shop, virtual currency, premium upgrades etc). 

I have never paid $50 for a game, that also offered in-game currency, and also offered pricey DLCs. But as Disney/Gameloft confidently integrate multiple revenue streams into their crappy game, Disney reminds us that anything is possible when you believe.

If you like cozy Animal Crossing type games, then this a fantastic game with familiar characters and a vibrant world that you can make all your own.

The in-game purchases seem to mostly be cosmetics and not something you need. There also seem to be more free content updates on the way with more characters and things which I am very much looking forward to playing. 

The cloud-save feature is the negative for me, because if I want to use my save on my Switch then I have to buy the game and DLC... AGAIN.

Granted, they have done some balancing when it comes to in game purchases, they're still ridiculously priced. Let alone with the new DLC, some character daily gifts are reliant on DLC items. 

I wanted to list this complaint separately so it can be highlighted and fixed. During the seasonal tasks, fishing is a right chore. Common fish like bass are dropped in spawn rates. It took 6 game sessions to complete fishing for all the bass I needed, which I believe was 10. After I finished that task, I got 5 in a row.

Edit: I really did enjoy the game. It gives a childhood nostalgia feel.

My only qualm is that the implementation of the WALL-E and Ursula packs has me feeling conflicted. If it was just the outfit that would be one thing but it's to also get extra side quests from them as well which I feel should just be added in the game play for free as part of the game content. 

I truly hope they don't start implementing more  ""pay to get more side quests in the game.""  It's one thing to want extra decorations, pets and skins but another to want to play the game but have to pay to do more things if you're all caught up and want more story and interaction with the characters.

The writing is mediocre at best. The voice acting is honestly bad with little to no attempt to sound like the characters represented. The plot, while potentially interesting, loses a lot of charm due to, once again, relying very heavily on nostalgia. Like many others I purchased the game in early access-- lured by the promise that it would be free to play for others later and that more content would be added as the game was developed. This turned out to be a lie as they backtracked on that promise. Not only is it pay to play the extra content is locked behind an expensive dlc leaving the base game feeling unfinished and cheap. Additionally the game is full of micro-transactions for additional content. 
If there is one redeeming quality it would be that I really enjoyed the decorating and level of control that the player is given in that aspect. You have full control over 'your' island in how it is decorated (though your paths will continuously be displaced and destroyed by thorns) and your house has plenty of expansion options. While the types of furniture you can personally 'design' are a little limited the range of styles offered in the store is broad enough that you can really get creative. I also really enjoy that clothing and facial hair aren't gender locked. That is, however, the only nice thing I have to say about this game. 
Also, the more it updates the more unstable is seems to be. The game, while not perfect originally, ran mostly smoothly when I first got it. It now stutters regularly as well as suffers more than the occasional crash. It's actually unpleasant to play because of this.

Edited to add the below: 

I started playing this game on Nintendo Switch in February of 2023 because I loved the idea behind the game -- it was another game in the same vein as Animal Crossing! And while I didn't really care about the Disney aspect of it, I was excited about many aspects of the game. Designing a village, gardening, the fashion elements; it was all right up my alley and sounded very cozy. However, I was not aware until after I purchased the game that it was originally intended to be free-to-play as that information was buried in the game description. 

I clocked about 80 hours on Switch. While avoiding Mickey Mouse's dead-eyed stare like the plague, I encountered several weird glitches with my character model and game crashes that resulted in the loss of numerous hours of progress at a time. What turned out to be the most annoying bug was the glitch I mentioned at the top of my review: my fully updated Scrooge's shop stopped functioning correctly. One day, I logged into the game and the shop hadn't repopulated the items in the window displays. A pile of coins was shown in each window display, as though the game thought that I had already purchased the items in both of the displays. I thought that was kind of weird but it didn't keep me from playing as I figured the developer team was already working on fixing the glitch (I had seen a series similar reports on the discord) and I wouldn't have to deal with it for too long. I also had hope on the horizon: I was going to purchase I Steam Deck. I had heard that the game would run much better on Steam Deck AND I could transfer my cloud save over so I wouldn't lose any progress. It sounded like a win-win.

So, I bought a Steam Deck in April 2023. Little did I know, the bugs/glitches I experienced on Switch would transfer with my cloud save. Whoopeeeee!

After I purchased the game a second time on Steam and booted it up, I noticed that my Scrooge's shop was still f*cked, my heart sank, and I finally decided to submit a report to the Gameloft help desk on April 15, 2023. While I waited to hear back from Gameloft, I played the game, looked longingly at the window displays in my Scrooge's shop, and eventually only started to login every few days to see if I felt a spark of joy tending to my pumpkins. 

On May 2, 2023, I received a reply to my support request. The body of the email that Gameloft's help desk sent to me is copied below: 

""Thank you for reaching out to us!

Please accept our apologies for replying to you with such a delay.

We are sorry that you faced this issue.

Our team of developers is investigating the problem with Scrooge's Store being empty. Unfortunately, it can take some time. No worries, if there is any error on our side, they will do their best to fix this issue in the shortest time possible.

Meanwhile, we'd like to draw your attention to the fact that time skipping (including changing the time on your device) may be one of the reasons for this issue.

So, if you've time skipped, please return to your proper time. Then you will need to wait until your game catches up with the date you time skipped to. Keep in mind that this is not instant and will take some time for your game to catch up. Sometimes by a few minutes/hours, sometimes another 24 hours, but it will catch up.

Thank you for your understanding!

Please feel free to contact us back in case of any other questions or concerns.""

While I was annoyed that the help desk immediately blamed me for the issue I was experiencing, I wanted to be helpful when I first received the above email so I sent them a follow-up reply email explaining that I had not time traveled and giving them further details about when the issue started and on what system(s) I was experiencing it. Gameloft never replied to my response email. I also tried to reach out a second time for an update on a fix for the bug and received an auto response that the ticket had been closed.

Dreamlight Valley just came out of early access, raised it's prices, still has the same boring game play, upped on micro transactions, put story related quests and characters behind a pay wall, and the base game still seems empty and lifeless like an early access game. I don't recommend this game at this price. Base game should stay 30$ to 40$ and the DLC should actually be updates to the game.

No, thank you.
Update: Now it's no longer otw to being F2P, it's Paid. And cash shop will still be in. It's not vanity items only, the quests are there for things too.

As a Disney fan, and the love of crossovers - its been really fun. 
The Characters are full of personality, and even talk about past events from their stories. It does make you feel that you are in their world(s).
While there's a lot of gathering this and doing this, its only 'grindy' if you want to complete all the objectives during events. But these events have a lengthy time of near a month or more. So if you dont want to rush through it, the quests are fine. 

Bugs, given my playtime and playing since it first came out, I have been fortunate to have only a couple of bugs which have been fixed by the devs as they are continually gathering feedback and updating the game. 

My only real negative is that It does have in game money which you can get from the world (50 a day), or just buy with real money. My concern would be it might be very hard to complete everything and collect everything without soon buying with real money - it might be possible over a very long time. Some items and quests being rather expensive (3000+ etc).
EDIT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ a few months ago they released a new feature, through submitting photos specifically themed each week, and using audience voting + submission score, you can gain moonstones. If players dress to the theme well with a nice fitting photo its quite easy to get 1K moonstones or even more a week. This event - and keeping the chests earning 50 each day - makes it a bit more kinder to gain those moonstones for those items without using real money.

I can understand many angry at their change of making this free to play, as well as creating a rather expensive paid DLC. Though the DLC itself introduces quite a lot, as well as an ingame game. The most important feature (hanging out with the characters) is still there, with the characters appearing on either map or at your request.",1690831649,1702490629,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

At first I was hesitant when they said it would not go F2P, however, I am glad they decided to keep it paid and I even do not mind the DLC being $30. Yes there is still a premium shop, however, the game does a great job of handing out the premium currency for playing. If you log in every day and get your blue chest, complete your dream snaps, and vote on dream snaps you almost always have enough currency for anything you want when the shop rotates. Now if you want to buy every single item in the premium shop then you may have to spend a bit, but there are a lot of things in the shop I don't bother buying because they are not for me (i.e. clothing, whimsical companions, some of the dream skins etc.) 

To those complaining the DLC is not worth the money are losing their minds. It is a huge new world (just as big as the original map), tons of new crafting items, new food and things to forage, and a whole new quest line that will span AN ENTIRE YEAR! Not to mention how fun and unique the royal hourglass and time bending are. To top things off once you do all the quests decorating and doing it well take forever and it is fun. I find a lot of people complaining on youtube, tiktok, etc. usually have boring looking islands and they just toss things around and don't really try when it comes to the main part of the game which is customizing.

I will say there are a lot of bugs (some game breaking at times) but this doesn't really seem like it is the developers but more the producers behind the game more than likely overworking them and forcing out things before they are ready. At the end of the day though the game also does a good job compensating for a lot of the bugs when they are fixed. For example, right now there are spawning issues for some of the new items you need for quests in the DLC so they sent an in game mail with plenty of the items as well as premium currency as a way to apologize until they get it fixed.

TLDR: Does the game have its issues? Yes. But at the end of the day is the game fun, constantly being updated, and full of things to do? Also yes. I really hope they continue to develop this game though I do hope they are cautious about how they change the way the monetize in the future. I think the current monetization of the game is the perfect balance.

Their insistence on making this game free to play before quickly changing their minds when the money from the premium shop started flooding in shows that the people who develop this game are greedy to the point of almost predatory. Moonstones cost far too much, the ""optional items"" (as they keep calling them) in the premium shop cost far too much, and the dlc is wildly overpriced considering it is platform specific AND split into 3 separate updates over the course of 6 months. It boggles my mind why they thought releasing a dlc was appropriate given all the bugs, lies and continued silence with their players. The dlc being platform specific was the kicker for me and it shows a lack of care from the dev team towards their fans/players.

The game has left the ""Early access"", and now it is fully ready for a proper evaluation. However, it did not receive a positive review despite the amount of positive emotions it brought to both me and my daughter. 

Excessive grinding detracts from the enjoyment of the story, and the game lacks a variety of interactions with characters, making it appear flat and one-sided. The game is genuinely boring. We didn't even participate in the latest ""Star Path"" even though we really wanted to get a skin for Stitch, as participation requires a lot of time, and it is very dull. 

In addition, previously, all characters were available for free (except for the cost of the game itself), and now, to acquire new characters, additional purchases with real money are required. This represents a completely different direction, as everything seemed quite different before. 

I really want to express my opinion about the Free-to-Play (F2P) refusal policy and the release of paid DLCs that cost more than the base game. However, my review will disappear from the search results. Of course, I strongly disagree with their policy. 

They deliberately informed about it during the ""Early access"", received a bunch of negative reviews, and now these reviews are considered ""irrelevant"" and hidden from the game's Steam store page. 

We played the game for 100 hours, and the rest seems like pointless grinding for rather mediocre skins. Good skins are only in the premium category, and I don't want to disappoint my daughter. 

Therefore, I will have to hide this game from the Steam library. We don't plan to play it anymore, and buying a second copy for multiplayer is not an option.

As someone who likes to reach completion with these types of games (ACNH for example, where I had everything bought, crafted and collected in a few hundred hours, with a 5 star rated island, which I was quite proud of what I made it to be), DV is developed with a mindset to keep people engaged in a very unhealthy way, asking the player to keep doing the same repetitive tasks over and over with very little progress on an exponential curve. ""Make sure to take healthy breaks though"". Yeah, how about you make a less psychologically predatory game?

Throughout the year (since ""Early Access"" Star Path 3 when I started my journey on console and transitioned to PC because of crappy performance and understanding the 'true' nature of the intended loop) this mobile game developer:
1. Broke their promises (implementing MTX in EA period and turning back on F2P model); 
2. Focused mostly on just pushing more bits of content out every few months (trying to achieve that quantity over quality) keeping the game quite buggy (on an EA period no less, where patches should be pushed more than once every 3 months), often annoying and to some people even game breaking;
3. Had no intention on improving the PC experience. So far over a year in EA into full release, there is still no:
a) Re-bindable keys (..because why use anything other than a controller, right?),
b) System for backup saves (..since various things like questlines and world itself often mess up in DV, having story progression halted, or items lost - which did happen to me as well, but I've learned to keep manual backups with games that have offline saves)
c) Ultrawide monitor support (..which would take almost no effort to enable on the Unity engine, and minimal UI adjustment, but apparently hardware-wise we all must still live in early 2010s);
4. Did almost nothing at all to make this game more enjoyable over the EA period, mostly just to implement more mechanics to fill their own greed; whilst keeping the dedicated crowd on that carrot, with FOMO Grind Passes and bunch of modern moronic exclusivity offers (order bonuses / Twitch Drops / event participation awards) - all of which the 'new player experience' will be lessened because of.
5. Oh, and everything needs to have a separate invisible untold times and timers to confuse the living heck out of you - daily reset / shop reset / talking and gifting reset / feeding reset / bedtimes and visitations for 87% of the characters, and countdown timers for every single crop/bush/tree/rock/etc.. WHAT. THE. FU>K!?

To shortly touch on the fake currency money shop - as of 1.0 release there is over 130 000 ""Moonstones"" worth of cosmetics to buy (..and counting). That is a lot, especially considering how a decent proportion of it is literally low effort reskins of animals or stuff taken from existing NPC furniture. At the same time, Scrooge's item/clothes shop (earnable stuff via gameplay) has been only half-functional ever since the game launched - RNG is (most likely purposefully) broken to not include (or have a ridiculously low show %) for about third of the furniture in the game, leaving island zones somewhat barren (unless you're into large scale farming and creating forests). Fret not though - you can buy a fancy house for 4000 Moonstones to fill up those empty areas! And by the way.. the intended (and possible) way to earn Moonstones is about 1000 each week (350 for 1-5 min island scan each daily login, and on average I'd assume somewhere between 600-900 for submitting something for a 'totally legit and mechanically explained' picture contest).. ONLY IF you actually stay active with the game on a daily/weekly basis. Good luck on catching up for, again, 130 THOUSAND worth of fake currency on this (NOOOT) F2P 70 euro 'early access' ""you only bought currency, not the game"" title. Holy $h!T, I can finally afford that ugly-ass sweater, or half the [insert shader color here] animals with the 2500 credits given to the OGs, oh how altruistic of them ..!., Genuinely curious if 1.0 release turned this game in my library into a proper one, or do they still have the right to 'end service' at some point down the line.

Look I normally don't go out of my way to leave negative reviews.. almost ever. Lorde knows (yes, Randy Marsh), that every ""gAmE aS a SeRvIcE"" needs a proper smack to reality as they're always made by $hitty companies without a conscience. DV isn't completely terrible as a game, but it misses out on all the potential it has to push this genre further, or to even be a decent fun experience that I'd want to return to without the pressure of missing out. I don't want to quit, but I also regret taking a leap of faith back into Gameloft territory. Should have known better!

Here are some short thoughts on Gameplay / Customization / Story, should anybody stumble on this wall of text and care:

Gameplay itself is somewhat of a mixed bag I'd say - on one hand it does look very nice with its vibrant colors and charming Disney style.. aaand it is essentially somewhat of an ACNH clone (copying almost everything, but a little bit worse) in proper 3rd person (where ACNH only had 3P view inside houses), but I honestly do like the fast placement mode, even if it is only half as functional. When you aren't trying to progress anything, it does have chill vibes. I guess cross-save is nice to have too, though on Series S it became kind of unpleasant after a while.. can't image what Switch must be. That is where the flattery stops though. The grind passes have no place in this type of game, and it is kind of scummy that each of them pushes activities with characters that have new store skins. First time around it might have felt kind of fun and helpful with its tasks, but every subsequent one has been a chore to complete. And they've increasingly made them lengthier, by asking player to do little bit more with many of the tasks, and giving less seasonal currency for those tasks. From my second to the last one, it is pretty clear that they've almost doubled on how long it takes now. With each one there is also a time pressure of 2 months, then ~3 weeks of nothing, where they could bring back old passes for people to finish, or just have seasons run back to back like normal GaaS games do it.

Customization-wise.. oh boy! 
Can't do something simple as changing my character's name - would have to wipe and restart. 
Instead of presets for your whole character look, best that they came up with is: ""Hey, lets only save the simple stuff on a mannequin, so definitely not the face that has more customization options than all clothing combined, and can bring the outfit together. And to make the mannequins more useless, lets only allow the placement inside the players house, where most people spend a fraction of their game time. And out of 6 different mannequins, lets have a limit of 5 per room."" Ugh, I don't even.. I just can't.
Instead of buying a piece of furniture, and then choosing it in (or refurbishing it into) an available color, there is a hundreds of simplistic L-couches / beds / counters / etc. in so many recolors as separate items. What am I going to do.. build bunch of couch-bed mazes into my Valley!? Have every room just be a kitchen?! Imma yell JACKPOT if on my next Scrooge visit I get a 'White Single-Door Counter (Right Handle) with Gray Marble Top'. And to top off the customization sorrows, most interesting items/furniture in the game don't have any way to interact with them.. pretty much just lights.

Story is like fast food - rushed and no substance. ""Here's what happened though [fade to black], and we're back!"" The fact that none of it can be re-experienced (chapters / saves / 'missions' / even dialogue history FFS!) makes me not care at all. ""Click-click-ah I missed it.""

Expect to pay $30 for every three disparate characters for the remainder of this very very long empty roster of Disney characters that once appeared to be a slow rollout for a partially-released title.

I just wish there was ways you could physically interact with the characters like hugging them and picking up the smaller characters (Wall-e and Remy, for example). I think it would be nice if everyone had their own hug style and you had to unlock the option by being at a certain friend level depending on their personality. I do like how if you choose for your character to run around barefoot, the sound design is actually different and accurate to running around barefoot rather than just one sound no matter what footwear you have on. I have not bough any heels from Scrooge or got any from clothing bags yet, so I don't know if they have their own sounds too, but I'm sure they do. For being an early access game this game is such great quality and I really recommend it to any Disney lovers and anyone who wants to fulfill their dreams of becoming a prince or princess, or just run around in pretty dresses barefoot like me lmao!

Updated review: As someone who has gotten into this game in the early stages I was truly satisfied and still feel like I personally have gotten my money's worth. However, I would not recommend the game to NEW players. 

Dreamlight Valley has devolved into a cash grab with slimy tactics which leave a bad taste in my mouth. I was firstly apprehensive with them deciding not to stick to the F2P strategy, especially seeing the micro-transactions strrategy they were going with (yes for cosmetic stuff, but cosmetic stuff in a game where cosmetics are essential). After it left early access, I was even more apprehensive seeing the price of the game they decided to go with, as well as the price of the DLC. 

The final straw was seeing how they approached the players' decision not to invest into the Rift in Time DLC. I have personally not felt it was worth the full price and was debating getting it - namely, I was waiting for more reviews. However, seeing how they shove DLC content down your throat and make the base game content more difficult without the DLC, only solidified my choice not the invest any more money. Not to mention that the extremely buggy state of the game which has been in early access for a year, made me lose faith in a project with showed such great potential. 

It's not a bad game, but it is not worth the money they're asking for and having seen the full evolution and the direction they've been taking it is only going to become worse with it's monetization system.

Little disappointed I'm not going to lie. Purchased the game early access and paid almost $75aud for the Ultimate Edition - Enjoyed the game for a bit but lost the enjoyment in playing for the fairly grindy nature of the levelling friendship system for the characters.

Got excited to find out new DLC was going to be released but was only led to more disappointment to find out I'd have to spend ANOTHER $45 on top of what I've already paid in order to access it, which is totalling more than the base game and DLC pack (Gold Edition $105)

While some might say ""but it's only a few $ more"" (total for my to also purchase DLC would be almost $120) that $15 is enough for ~2 meals given the country I live in is in a cost of living crisis.",1672052048,1702209131,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's fun, it's great to have all these familiar Disney characters in an interesting world that you can design however you like. You can design your character in many different ways and the quests are mostly fun too.

So what is it that makes me give this a negative rating?

No, it's not the micro (or rather macro) transactions in the game for otherwise unobtainable items. While I'd prefer the game to have ways to obtain these items without spending even more real world money it's an aspect of the game I'm somewhat willing to accept. But what really frustrates the hell out of me is the blatant exploitation of FOMO in the players. While the seasonal events are fun in its own way, what's not fun is certain items from those events being completely unobtainable when said event is over. So many live-service-games (or whatever you want to call them) do this and I don't see why anyone would see this in a positive light. Just now I was trying to craft something but I couldn't find a certain ingredient anymore and after looking it up online found out the item is simply GONE for now. That's not fun. Meanwhile, old quest items that should have delete themselves when said quests were done somehow manage to glitch and are stuck with you forever. No fix from the devs for those. This might be petty or whatever but as long as this game doesn't get some type of vendor for past event items or properly integrates those items to the game I can't give this a positive rating.

UPDATE December 2023:
So now they've added an expensive story DLC (which they promised they'd never do) and it actually messes with the game in the worst ways. For example items only available in the DLC will now sometimes be required as gifts for villagers. This is unacceptable",1689707013,1702206898,False,25,0,0.612743556499481201,0,True,False,True

Not mentioning the decision to not make this game F2P (how it was planned), but the situation with DLC more expensive that the base game (bout 1/3 more)??? That's just riddiculus.
And what's more, Gameloft is nearly forcing players to buy DLC by making gameplay in base version more difficult, because there are tasks that you cannot do when you don't have the Rift in Time.

I have completed all of the Main game story line, currency package quests, and character quests. I did take a break for a little while and missed some content. I also have gotten about 5 hours into the expansion pack. 

Things I have not completed. All clothing, furniture, star paths, memory collections and have only decorated 4 out of 8 Main game biomes. (So a long ways to go still)

The ups and downs are pretty normal for a game like this. 
Pros: 
1. An enormous amount of content and quests to keep the game play value relevant. 70$ for the ultimate founders package and it was well worth it at 125 hours of game time. (Unless you are that person that has to burn through a game as fast a possible)
2. Lots of costume, biome, and housing customization. Each one has over 1000 options to collect. 
3. You can tell the developers have left room to expand. With the addition to the base game default of 3 realms they added 4 for free and other characters with quests for free over time as well. Lots of doors are still locked and there is room for more expansions as well. (With a couple already announced for future release for free btw) I am also aware they released premium currency quest lines as well.
4. The music although somewhat repetitive is incredible and nostalgic. 
5. Even though the developers stated it would be free to play I am glad they are going with the model they have. I have never had to spend a dime other then the game itself to achieve what I wanted. I can grab my daily chest and complete dream snaps and have enough currency to play the premium star path and buy what I want from the premium shop. If they went the free to play route I can only imagine having to buy energy potions from a cash shop just to mine gems or farm.

Cons:
1. If you are a completionist you have to play period! There are daily chest you have to get. Every week the Dream Snaps change and the premium shop rotates. Ever month or so is a new Star Path that takes time to complete. I took a long break and missed a ton of items I wish I could have. This is entirely my fault and I may never get those items now. But for players that are just now starting they missed an entire year of  exclusive items. 
2. When decorating it is on a grid system. I can understand this on a top down or 2.5d game but not a fully 3d game. Hopefully some day it will provide free rotation of items in build mode. 
3. Very repetitive quests (to be expected). But the time gated quests bother me. When the quest gives you a 4 hour window (morning, afternoon, or evening) to get an item during a 24 hour day that is an issue that needs to be resolved. 
4. Endgame is decorating and having to purchase certain items from Scrooges. That involves a 25 item limit per day. Ps. some quests require you to buy items from him. Delete the limit or increase it. 

Overall this game is great and I am happy with the development of it there are bugs here and there but those are easy to deal with. There are some quality of life improvements that can be made also. The developers are pumping out content and almost all of it is free. (I know I know you hate having to buy an expansion pack that doubles the game after playing for 100 hours boo hoo). For those of you that are new to gaming I am going to let you in on a little secret....Every game charges for expansion packs....The amount of content the developers have pushed out for free to those that jumped on the founders packs outweighs the cost of 30$.

they're genuinely enjoyable.

alright spoiler stuff here so-

The only thing ill say this game does really well is discussing topics of growing up and how depression can change a person and make you forget the things you love and see the good in life.
However, like this game and Disney, they run on your nostalgia and your love for the characters for your cash, the reason i say this is because they had in-game currency during early access and them added cosmetic items you can buy with said currency.
Now, this game even in early access was around 40 dollars, the gold is 70 dollars and then they have the gull to make the dlc, which feels like was suppose to be in the base game to begin with, 30 dollars.

So if you're the type of person to go to disneyland every month to praise to your lord and savior mickey mousesus christ and sacrifice your first born child to the mouse, then go ahead, i think you'll probably enjoy the game as it is and its obvious you don't mind spending the money.

However if you're someone who works all day and only have time to play at night, you'll find yourself stuck at quests and unable to progress because for some god forsaken reason, some quests and pets you can get have to be on very specific times super early in the morning or in midday where people who can actually afford games, are generally at work actually getting money so they dont have to sacrifice their newborn child to the mouse.

The decorating can be fun, but waiting for new items is tedious and frankly isn't worth it to get the same framed picture of the lord and savior mickey mousesus christ. Also theres still some floating foliage around the map so have fun.
The games progression system in general is tedious.
Personally i can't recommend it in good faith, but ill probably keep playing if i have nothing better to do or im just bored.",1702176674,1702176674,False,6,0,0.56554800271987915,0,True,False,False

After unlocking all the areas of the game, I always end up doing the same things when I load up the game. I start by going through all the areas and harvesting/replanting the crops I grow. As ive learned that the best way to make money. Then I loop around all the areas again to collect the misc. things such as flowers, gems, resources, ect. I would say the price of the game itself is a little disappointing as the game-play became stale and repetitive for me after some time. My biggest complaint would have to be 2 things. 1: The shop where you gets clothes/ furniture. I don't know if im cursed or what, but I am constantly getting boring clothes, or furniture. Also repeats quite often. I am not sure why they put the most basic things in the shop constantly but it is so disappointing, especially since there are few ways to get these items. 2: The micro transactions. For a game that costs quite a bit already, i'm disappointed in what they want you to pay more money for inside the game. I mean, cosmetic things are fine I guess, but as of now there are 2 story/character related packs that cost i think between  $20-$30. ON TOP of what you already pay for the base game itself. As far as i've heard as well, future Disney characters will be locked behind a paywall. Disney being greedy as usual I suppose. If you like animal crossing and need something to fill that void, id say this game is a good filler, but it does get old fast, and the micro transactions are a huge disappointment to me. I don't feel like I can recommend the game solely for that reason, but feel free to watch videos online and decide for yourself if its worth the investment.

UPDATE: I downloaded their latest update and began grinding again because I was so excited for the multiplayer update. I thought it would be so fun to run around and harvest or do quests with my friends to keep my interest in the game. I was sorely disappointed. Once you get into the game with your friend, you are extremely limited. You cannot use any of your tools. You cannot harvest anything and the only things you can pick up are things you drop, or things that are lying on the ground like sticks, rocks, or flowers. You can only enter your house and the store, no other buildings. Once you've given your friend a tour and shown them your shop and house, there really is nothing else you can do with each other. I hate that I was so excited for the update, only to be let down so hard. ALSO my friends and I tried playing together again today,  I could connect with one of my friends perfectly fine. My other friend however, couldn't join anyone at all. And nobody could join her. We tried looking up the issue online and it seems like a lot of people are having this issue.

Dreamlight Valley is incredibly enjoyable. It's easy to navigate and play, and I have already gotten my friends, who are not huge game fans, to join.

This game kind of reminds me a bit of Disney Magical Worlds on the 3ds/switch but if it was more like ACNH. 

Cozy games for me have always been a bit of a hit or miss especially if they have farming elements due to the stamina systems that are hard to refill and cause you to pass out and abruptly end the day and/or time limits which you have to be in bed at a certain point or risk fainting/getting penalized which always stressed me out a bit as I rush around to complete tasks or do quests due to a 20 minute day/night cycle where instead I wish I could simply slow down and not have to worry about it.

The game isnt perfect as there as it does suffer from a few minor gaming industry sins like micro-transactions and the DLC is a little pricey (Perhaps pick it up when it goes on sell) but at least it isn't something overly greedy and paid content is only really limited to cosmetic items instead of actual in-game currency.

Overall I would highly recommend that you pick up this game. Its really fun and something all ages will enjoy (Just watch your kiddos with the microtransctions)

ETA dec 7th: The DLC is now affecting players that don't have it. Multiple of my villagers have items only found in the DLC as their favorite items such as Bumblestone and Glowing flowers, leaving me wholly unable to give them gifts for the day.

Bought for $30 on the promise that it would come out of early access as free to play. Today, their first major update dropped at an additional $30, for 25% of the content we got from the initial purchase, half of which was promised at launch and later changed to be DLC. Gameloft has gone money hungry, and until this game releases with the promises they made on launch, this will remain a negative recommendation. There isn't enough replay-ability for them to be charging this much money. Your character only levels up to level 40, it's somehow an even slower trickle for store items than Animal Crossing.

Honestly... If I had known what kinda game this would turn into... I would never have bought it, I would never had spent this much time on this game. Tedious tasks, stressful events unless you pay real money or just have a lot of time and energy to play... THIS is not a fun game... could be a great game but... save yourself some money and time...

So many free to play games out there that are so much better. No longer a fan of Disney so f***ing disappointed in them... I'm over wasting time on this hollow empty excuse for a game.
And again this is my opinion feel free do to what you wish with it.

Old Review 

For a early access game it has a lot of content (90ish hours as of this review) and most of is rly cute and fun; that said there is a lot of *grind* repetition... I noticed that Iron seem to be a resource that's always low.

All in all a fun game minor glitches and some quests require patience (aka go play some other game), I found it weird how they make the player forced to wait and unable to affect the time in game; on some quests I get it because it makes sense with the magic in game and the story being told. But often time it feels drawn out as if the creators are trying to make a quest take longer than it needs to just to fill up time. (Short games can be fun too!)

So far not seeing much replay-ability in this game so I hope the choices when u answer characters good or bad start to matter in the future.

Also not sure why Eric has Aladdin's haircut O.o like what? his hair is way too long and his mouth is like the grinch so wide why? just a thought I had when I met him.

Love that the Elsa added was from frozen 2 and the fact that in the future Ariel will be able to come on land.
Hoping similar to Moanas Fishing and WAll-E's Farming there will be a way to ""Automate"" mining; because so far... the mining is not fun... It's slow and tedious and the amount of Iron you will need if you wanna decorate properly including other gems is... alot... 

Looking forward to see how it evolves in the future... (multiplayer? :D) Have high hopes for this game... rly hoping they add Genie from the animated movies. XD 
Hum what else... Oh yeah

- The npc's u mine with sometimes get jiggly (stuck on the ground) trying to give u the gem as a mining companion, u can boop them most of the time by just running into them which solves it for now.

- You can actually get trapped in Remy's kitchen! (for whatever reason if u go in there with a companion and cook u sometimes can't move them when u try to go out of the small kitchen, yes Maui I get he big and kinda -_- annoying but Woody!? he's a tiny toy; rly hope that gets fixed had to got to the menu screen lol.)

Maybe let us teleport from inside buildings and such it would rly help especially with getting out of the mystical (atlantis) cave on Dazzle Beach, rather than running all the way back out.

Will add more if I come across anything, but all in all I do recommend it; It's fun and mostly relaxing, do wish things were not tied behind villain quest-lines so we could actually choose who we befriend but ye.",1673531656,1701958258,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

now you may ask, okay why did you give it a thumbs down? (i barely do) well let me explain it to you.

- free to play?
before this game came out officially on dec 5th the game was in early acces as you may know. they announced this game as being free on release. which would be great so you can easily cross play and use the ingame cloud save. anyhow a few months before they said that it won't be free anymore. which to me was sad, but i thought it was fine. like alright they need money to make the game. now i'm starting to think if that might have been the case really or if they just wanted more money from it's players. they also added 20 euro's to the base game when it officially came out. the gold edition bundle is reasonable. as early acces player you get the decoration items, which is nice. 

- dlc
haven't played the dlc as much yet, but it looks great so far. it looks really filled with content. however i have some problems with it. first of all it's more expensive than the early acces price of the main game, now almost as much as the main game. it  really sucks that those characters (raps my fav) are put behind a paywall. and here is why i think they just want more money. the dlc isn't really a dlc it's more of an expension pass, an ingame purchase. it's linked to 1 cloud save file (e-mail) and also only accesible on the device you bought it. so if you have multiple cloud saves you gotta BUY the dlc MULTIPLE TIMES. which also means you couldn't even use it for cross play, but have to pay ingame (buy it in game to make sure it's linked correctly, don't buy it on steam itself) and don't download anything. why is it locked then?? you can't even find this clearly. you have to really dig on the internet to find this answer. it's burried on their support page. 

i'm really starting to question which is worse. EA or gameloft.

will i still continue playing? yes. does this really suck also yes. do i love it yes, am i dissappoint yes. it's really like what i always say. ""all my homies hate (and love) disney"". should you buy this? it's really up to you. do you wanna risk having more behind paywalls go for it. you don't need the dlc i think? so you could also play without. besides all the money stuff it's a good game worth playing.

The longer explanation involves how everyone who bought the ULTIMATE Edition now has the basic game. So that implies if you buy the GOLD Edition now, then in a few months, you'll have the basic edition when the next DLC comes out, and then the SUPER Edition will have the DLC included, then a few months after that, those will have the basic and then the MEGA Edition includes the DLC, then ... you get the picture.

Maybe.

Or maybe you're just a Disneyholic and you're looking forward to shelling out another $30 - $50 for each of those editions that should have been included the first time.

Of course, this game looks neat. It's kind of relaxing in a world where most of my library involves violence and death.

- Progress or change anything about your world while anyone else is visiting or even while your world is ""open"" to visitors

Hundreds of thousands of people paid for this game pre-release in order to support the development and get a preview before the game's exciting free-to-play full release. We bought micro-transactions - introduced on the basis the game is releasing free-to-play - and battle passes since ""it just makes sense"".

I play this game every day recently and I didn't even realise that yesterday was full release. Full PAID release.

Gameloft just decided to change their minds after the false pretence presented of it being F2P on release... I've been telling younger family members about this game for MONTHS and they've been waiting for it to release to play it! The multiplayer addition was so exciting! We could play it together! Except now there's troves of children losing out on what was such a wonderfully enriching experience for me, because their family can't afford this price tag/just can't afford to put money into a video game like this.

Not only did they snap change their mind, but they ""released"" this BROKEN BETA VERSION of a game with a PAID DLC - THAT'S DEARER THAN THE GAME.

I HAVE MAIN VILLAGE CHARACTERS who are asking for items from the PAID DLC as their daily wants 😭

Some people have, to them, sunk an amount of money into this game that the mentality can now kick in of it being too late to turn back.

The game plays worse today than it did a handful of weeks ago. There was NO promo for the full release. I didn't even know this last content update was ""full release"" until just 10 fateful minutes ago. This is absolutely ridiculous, please don't support this predatory practice (THEIR TARGET AUDIENCE IS CHILDREN).

THE DLC ISN'T EVEN FINISHED.

As if Disney didn't have enough money as it is.

I really do love this game, but I don't know if I recommend buying it in it's current state. It's reignited my love for Minnie Mouse and the plot made me feel emotions I didn't know were possible to feel in a game about a village full of Disney characters. The art style is simple but pretty and I genuinely enjoy speaking to the different characters and decorating my village.

However, the game is incredibly buggy. It's been out for over a year now and the number of bugs are still actually incredibly prevalent and noticeable. Sometimes it's to the point where I can't shut a dialogue box or memory and then I have to force quit the game. Sometimes it's a sliding character. Nala barely ever plays her walk animation and just SLIDES across the map whenever I see her. Sometimes the objects will change mesh when you've been in furniture mode for a while and they don't change back.

And then the CHEEK to put so much emphasis on how they're adding features such as Dreamsnaps and then continuing to add content based upon the purchasing of Moonstone, a premium currency, when the bugs haven't even been ironed out yet.

I love this game so much, and I know it's in early development, but it's frustrating to pay for a game only to have it be full of bugs which effect my gameplay to a noticeable degree and then have micro transactions thrust into my face.

Old review below-

While this game is still in early access and the dev team are still working their way through the bugs, I highly recommend this if you like disney or like a game where you can hop on, do a few daily quests or do a bit of work on the long story or friendship quests and then hop off for the day. There are some annoying quests like there are in any video game but Dreamlight still allows you to take your time with things and I appreciate that about it.

And for the animal crossing lovers, don't you worry, you can customize a lot about the valley and truly make it your own! The clothing comes quickly and easily and the furniture you get can be re-bought at an ungraded Scrooge McDuck store and makes for a very easy decorating experience. Love it love it love it! Even with event stuff, you can still re-buy it for the ultimate themed decoration explosion. It's amazing.

I purchased the ultimate edition when it first released and really enjoyed the game with the expectation that it would be free on full release as mentioned by Gameloft. Thought to myself, great! I could transfer my save across devices! There were star paths (Battle pass equivalent) and 'quest packs' that i thought were money grabby but didn't mind too much as they were not really needed to play. I did purchase a few things here and there to support development. Nothing to drastic. Then, the announcement that when it leaves early access, it would not go free. I again, figured it was because development cost a lot and it is a nice polished game. I got hyped up for the DLC! i was really looking forward to it... log on this morning to go and purchase... and what?? its MORE expensive than the base game alone? NOPE.

Base game: 33.99

Thankfully I did not purchase any bigger packs in anticipation of gameloft/disney pulling obvious, greedy and disgusting a**-hattery.

As other reviewers pointed out numerously: After getting ""carried"" and generously financed through EA by many fans and families the greed reigns supreme over fairness and gratitude. Gameloft and/or Disney pulling an EA Sims4 and Paradox-worthy pricing model with following numbers in my region:

35.- basegame to get carried for an incomplete game through EA
or 60-80? for the larger/max EA supporter package?

only to end up with following, greedy rip-off converted local->USD pricing after 1.0 release:

- 47.- (!) basegame
- 83.- gold edition
- 120.- (!) total for a gold edition and their first DLC! :D
-> Which doesn't even include any passes or other, expensive, greedy and simplistic in-game MTX paywalls and whatnot... for a cozy, but after all: quite a simplistic and primitive game.

Thankfully such situation doesn't apply to myself: But if you are the kind of individual or family that's barely able to pay all bills and insurance, let alone have some quality of life while working 100% or more... while still potentially supporting such a game at full price. Well then I guess you get what you deserve anyways. All the others - can thank a passive, ignorant majority... that cheers and revels at purely evil, greedy, crooked and vile institutions, governments and corporations including the likes at gameloft management who clearly have zero morale, ethics and zero empathy for life or anything that's even remotely sacred or truly valuable.

If you are financially struggling but unable to notice any similarities between the social, cultural and political causes and problems in your life... compared to business practices and greed ""cultivated"" in gameloft's upper management: well I guess then no one can help you.

This is a very relaxing game with loads of Disney charm. I've spent many an hour collecting furniture/clothes, farming, mining, gathering, fishing, decorating and making Disney friends. Overall the experience has been a fun and addictive one. 

The game has events weekly, beginning on Wednesdays, called Dreamsnaps you can participate in for Moonstones, which are one of the in game currencies. You'll use them to purchase items in the online shop (4 rotating items which are far too expensive for what is offered), join a Star Path, or purchase a special character's quest line (which I'm highly against as far as quests go and too expensive). None of these things are required for the main game play.

There are also community events which take place at different times and seasonal events too. All fun. All free.

The community events can be outside of game on other social media, but again, you don't have to participate. You will miss out on free items given during those events. Stinks if social media is not your thing and you'd rather not have your kids participate, but they'll never know about them unless they read the game announcements. Be prepared for that talk about what you expect from them and remember it's your responsibility to keep an eye on what your children are doing online and with whom they are interacting with. I shouldn't have to tell you Online is the wild west and not child friendly. Again, none of the social media is required for game play.

[strike]This is a single player game and you will not be interacting with any other living person while playing Dreamlight Valley.[/strike] Now they have a device in game that allows people on your friends list to visit your Dreamvalley and you theirs when you activate it. There is no way this could go wrong for anyone./sarc

I've prattled on long enough.
Do I recommend the game for all ages? Yes.
Do I recommend the social media aspects for children? NO! Hard No. Do I really need to explain why?
Do I recommend spending real world money on moonstones? NO! Earn them in game with a Daily Blue Chest of 50 moonstones and participating in DreamSnaps for more.

Score was 9/10 for the game play. Lost a point for starting down the path of being another ridiculously expensive money hungry DLC store front. Will remove my recommendation and 8 more points should they continue down the Electronic Arts path. Which would be sad considering how much fun and relaxing the game is. Score now a 5/10 lost 4 more points for charging supporters Full Price for an overpriced DLC. Sadly I don't see this improving. 

Edited: I purchased this game at the highest tier to help out with what this game was before the cash grab began. I considered that money well spent at the time, as I've felt I'd gotten more than my monies worth in game play. Call me entitled all you want. I'll call you Foolish/Gullible for not understanding the true value of a dollar and what should and shouldn't be tolerated in the gaming industry.

They announce game won't be free to play. Ok. Plenty of paid games have microtransactions. Mo money, mo problems.

The Day has arrived. Full Release. MORE PAYWALLS. They want $30 for DLC??? The villagers want things from the area LOCKED BY THE DLC PAYWALL.

What little bit of story was present has been sidelined hard to focus on microtransactions. Nothing is priced fairly, all of the special events in the game have been watered down in order to sell you whatever decent assets they made, new quests are bland and uninspired. Not to mention, everything has been super buggy and continues to remain buggy. It took months for them to resolve multiple bugs that honestly could have been done by adding a check to certain quests. 

I would have no real issues with this if they had waited for the game to launch F2P, which is happening eventually, but when you've purchased the game only to have every decent aspect of it ripped out and turned into a microtransaction... I cannot state it enough, don't bother with this game unless you're willing to keep spending money on it.

Edit 10/7/23: since the time of my original review, there have been some changes although none that justify changing anything in my original post. the addition of an online, community driven voting system for various photo challenges has been added. this system is not intuitive in the slightest; despite the fact that it is meant to give players the option to vote on photos submitted by other players in order to earn their in game currency that can also be purchased for actual money dollars, the system itself is arbitrary with no real means of communicating the outreach of it's scope. one online user has stated that they submitted the same photo from two different accounts only to receive vastly different rankings/results. the addition of this feature is welcomed, but likely requires some fine-tuning before it is perfected.

another thing of note is their ""cozy edition"" version of the game, which is a physical* copy of the base game with a handful of unique items to it's name. this includes some skins for your pet ""companions"" which hold no significant value to gameplay, some moonstones which are the in game currency which you can earn or buy for actual money, some exclusive shirts for your avatar, a skin for your house which can also be purchased straight from the in game marketplace which rotates weekly, and some physical collectables such as posters and stickers. this does NOT grant you items for the items in the higher editions of this game, and those who purchase any version of the game online are NOT given these items no matter which tier you purchase.

the various editions of the game aren't my core issue, it is the inherent greed of gameloft as they have created a game in which the purpose is to decorate your valley and collect items within the game. the need to repackage the base game with small differences between the packs in order to capitalize off of those who are currently supporting the game is ridiculous. at the time of writing this review, the only way to play cross platform is to purchase the game multiple times. if you wish to collect every item this game has to offer, be prepared to spend more money as i am expecting this behavior to continue over time.

this game is still unstable, cannot be played for long periods of time on consoles without crashing, has buggy companions and quests, is unoptimized and often unplayable, it is currently not worth the price.

EDIT 12/6/2023: well, it got worse between the last update I made and this one. It was announced that this F2P game would not in fact be going F2P. The justification for having microtransactions in a cozy game was that ""hey, it's gonna be free and the microtransactions are going to help fund development"" LOL yeah right. evidently F2P was not going to be good enough to line their pockets and the idea has been shelved. It's less likely that they viewed marketing towards children as abhorrent/predatory and instead realized that having people pay full price for half a broken game was a much better business model. I wont get into the cash grabby nature of the game anymore, it's ridiculous to me that this silly little game is so deeply rooted in taking advantage of it's playerbase.

The newest issue is the paywall ""founding"" players got after being promised that no one would be paywalled. Things like mass watering for gardening and making batches of things are stuck behind the DLC, meaning you'd have to pay for features that are typically base game. Not to mention some of the promotional characters such as rapunzel and eve are also paywalled (I've seen so many people complain about this one, because they had hoped one of their favorite characters would join their game without having to pay for an overpriced DLC)  ALSO the next ""chapter"" of the story is behind a paywall. Which is egregious considering how they so poorly slapped together the first ending was. In all, I still cannot recommend this game.

The gameplay itself is fine, basically Animal Crossing meets Disney (without the wait times, I may add). However, this game was originally slated to become free to play a year after the initial release. Gameloft has since not only retracted that meaning you have to pay full price to access the game, they've now introduced DLC that includes characters and locations important to the main story.

As it stands, in order to get access to the full story, you need to pay a minimum of $70. Now, some of you may think that's normal price for a game. But keep in mind, this paywall for new content was never once mentioned over the YEAR the game has been out, and the base game originally was supposed to become free to play.

They did say they'll shove the occasional free content update in there to make it feel balanced, cause free color variants of already existing clothing is equal to receiving new characters with questing!!

It's good for mindless fun. The quests are super straightforward and you always know what you have to do next because it's spelled out for you. But that made me get bored. I feel like I was just doing the same things over and over again. 

Then they announced it was no longer going to be free. I don't appreciate this...

DLC is one thing. I don't judge them for making DLC. A lot of games make DLC for new content and a rift in time does seem like a large enough amount of content to be considered separate from the main story. The problem I have is the micro-transactions. These made sense to me when the game was going to become free to play. I paid for early access and I didn't really enjoy the micro-transactions before the full launch either. Games should not be able to charge $30, $50, $70 for a game that is just going to ask you to spend more money for items.

This is obviously my personal opinion and I am aware they'll continue making money and other people have no problem with this. But to me, micro transactions should only be used for free games as a sole way to make income. When we start getting charged for access to a game just to get charged for more items in the game, do we really ever own anything?

I can't personally recommend this. During early access, I would have absolutely recommended it. You could get access for $20 and play most of the quests and even if you eventually got bored, you didn't invest too much into the game. Now that it's TWICE the price and even the DLC is more expensive than the cost of early access a year ago. Even without the micro-transactions, I got bored and don't touch the game anymore.

UPDATE 2: The game will no longer be going free to play, and the first DLC is very overpriced. :(

Surprisingly fantastic so far, I'm really enjoying it. 

Though I was definitely a Disney kid, and a Disney teen, miraculously I didn't evolve into a Disney adult, and I haven't really cared about Disney for a while now. Nostalgia wasn't enough to hook me, and I was hesitant to buy since it will be going free to play on release and will rely on battle passes to make money from then on. Still, the stellar reviews enticed me, and I'd say I've more than gotten my money's worth. 

Overall, a simple but solid gameplay loop of things you'd expect from a game like this like mining, fishing, gardening, etc, with enough intertwined systems, progression, and rewards to keep you motivated. The characters have all been charming and more interesting than I expected, and they are designed in a way that actually adds a lot to the experience. Each of them has levels with rewards themed after their character, a questline with quests unlocked at certain levels, and you can assign them to a job that they will help you with whenever you bring them along. The way your level, npc levels, quests, upgrades, and gradually unlocking new zones all ties together is really polished and feels like a big improvement on the genre. Pretty much everything you do is working towards multiple major goals at once. 

The battle pass stuff is pretty reasonable and unintrusive and the challenges are easy to complete with a generous time frame, though its still a bit FOMO and you seem to be out of luck if you miss one. The clothing and furniture options from the actual game are more than enough so it doesn't bother me much. You're also able to make the points you spend on a battle pass back by completing it, which is great. If they bring past rewards back somehow I will be appeased.

I think Disney Dreamlight Valley has already earned its place beside Animal Crossing, and it isn't even out of early access. Interested to see what this game will look like with a massive cast of characters and how it will handle making space for all of them, and what longevity it will have for me once I've reached the end of progression.

Besides the game being pumped with every trash micro-transaction options that there are in the world, the game doesn't bring anything that will be interesting or make you feel rewarded. Even if you get Ultimate Edition and play ~500 hours, the only thing that you are given is duties in star path that are only changed in wordings such as` ""Give Kristoff his favorite 5 gifts"" and ""Give professional lute player in the village 5 favorite gifts"". The other times 500 duties are thrown at you to do 50 times this, catch 50 times this, etc.. Which star path is this? 6? And what will new expansion give anyone? More place to do those 50 things.

An incredibly cozy, charming game in the farming and crafting sim genre I would definitely recommend - especially for any Disney fans out there. Getting to interact with your favorite characters while doing quests and progressing through the main story adds such a nice sense of nostalgia! I am already completely obsessed and loving all of the adorable hints and details towards additional favorite classics hidden inside the game. If you are a fan of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, or the Sims, this game will be right up your alley!

Updated review as of Dec 2023:
I am incredibly disappointed in the direction this game has gone. Initially when I bought access to this game, it was under the impression that we would be seeing it go free to play in 2023 (this year). I was more than happy to spend my $40 as I expected to get many hours of content and enjoyment out of it in early access before eventually going free. And even when the announcement came out that it wouldn't be going free to play this year, I was disappointed but not entirely off-put yet considering I would rather a game be polished as much as it can before it is released to the general public - and considering how many game-breaking bugs are currently still a problem in the base game, that stood as an incredibly important note.

However Gameloft have once again proven themselves to be more focused on money grabbing than developing quality gameplay experiences. A paid DLC expansion that costs MORE than the basegame is a red flag for any given game - but especially for a game that isn't in full release and lacks a lot of the promised gameplay features that the current player base have been waiting on for the past 1-2 years. Coupled with showcasing characters in their promotional trailers and images for the basegame since the beginning of its early access period that are now locked behind paywall dlcs, pushing out more 'versions' of the same base game that have no actual game-changing value (only hold limited-edition cosmetic features as incentives to buy), overpriced in-game store items, and the ever-increasing list of bugs, I cannot recommend this game to anyone knowing that they would be paying a company that does not value honesty.",1663527459,1701797736,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Today marks the grand release of their inaugural expansion for Disney Dreamlight Valley. However, hold onto your Mickey ears because this expansion comes at a princely price of $30! That's right, the same cost as the base game, except you'll be pocketing 3000 fewer moonstones (8000 in the base game versus a mere 5000 in this expansion). It's like paying full price for a Gaston-sized mug of LeFou's brew but receiving a Chip-sized portion in return.

Now, let's talk about content—or the lack thereof. It seems this expansion might be skinnier than a Jack Skellington scarecrow. With Gameloft confessing that at launch, this expansion is merely a third of the size it's expected to be eventually, it's like starting a Disney movie and only getting to see the first act before the credits roll. A steep price for what seems like a fraction of the promised magical adventures.

Adding insult to injury, we've encountered a delay in the appearance of the current star path. It's akin to waiting for Cinderella's carriage to arrive but this time we had to wait 1.5 months instead of the usual swift turnaround. It seems that Gameloft's priority is filling their pockets with gold doubloons rather than delivering the full enchantment they promised during the game's early access release.

In the realm of Disney-themed games, one would hope for a journey as grand as a ride on Space Mountain or a quest as captivating as a voyage through Pirates of the Caribbean. Alas, it appears Gameloft might have cast a spell of greed rather than one of wonder and excitement.

In conclusion, this expansion feels more like a deal with Hades than a gift from Fairy Godmother. Gameloft's pursuit of monetary gains appears to have steered this once-promising Disney Dreamlight Valley off the magical track, leaving players feeling more like Sleeping Beauties awaiting a prince's awakening kiss. Here's hoping that in the future, Gameloft finds a way to restore the pixie dust of excitement and fulfill the dreams they initially promised in this enchanted Disney gaming universe.

Original edit: I have to edit my review and change it from a thumbs up to a thumbs down, the monetisation they have displayed over the past few months are very concerning. They have been locking tons of cosmetics behind the paid currency which is sometimes a bummer but whatever, it will be a free game and they need to make more revenue than they earn off of the battle pass apparently. 

Sadly with the last update they have also started locking quests behind in my opinion ridiculously priced moonstones. The newly added wall-e quest costs 4000 moonstones. 5500 moonstones cost 20$ which means that this quest pack adds up to 14.54$.

I still enjoy playing the game but the expanding monetisation is making me worried for how this game will continue to develop.

When buying the game, think about whether or not the pricing is worth it in the long run, to me it was when i bought it. But I cant say whether it is or not for you.

All the negative reviews based on the promise for free-to-play that was made when the game first premiered are quite unfair. How are they going to guarantee a free game when the game is still in early access? There's no way to guarantee that the game will stay free when early access just started.

I bought this not knowing that and while I would still buy it I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up for even 10% of a full game, you get the bare bones of the prologue and when you finish you're going to be waiting month after month for another character or two to drop. Yes I should have done more research before buying the game, but unless you were following the development of the game you probably wouldn't know. 

Gameplay: 6/10 at the moment. Lots of early glitches that the devs are fixing but be ready to have some issues completing quests, gathering materials, and leveling up friendships with certain characters. They have been fairly opaque with when we will receive fixes but there are a lot of problems they should've caught early on in beta testing. 

Storyline: 7/10. We've gotten very little information on the story and where this game is going, the opening details you learn are far and few, given by characters and spread out in journal entries you collect. 

The Store/Buying: 4/10. Scrooge is the next Tom Nook, he will squeeze every coin he can out of you but most of the items are worth the cost. If you play long enough you get a lot of repeat items as of right now and that can get old quick, some movie series have been followed closer than others (if you love Toy Story you will be confused by all the furniture) and you can get duplicate items for furniture. Also note that there is a Premium Store that requires moonstones (irl money). 


Overall: I love this game don't get me wrong, I can see great potential in this game if they tweak some things during E.A. and patch some bugs the community is passing on. The characters are spot on, the world is beautiful and well rounded, and it's possible to earn a lot of money is you're willing to grind a bit. That being said, it's such a small piece right now that I would say if you're a collector buy it now, if you want a full story wait a bit. And maybe stay off their Discord unless you want a constant bombardment of squealing happy Disney fans.

Edit: Since this review GL has determined the game will not be free to play and characters/biomes/etc are to be locked behind purchases with more real life money and as such I can no longer recommend this game to potential purchasers. If you play this game please know that it is the equivalent of a phone game with micro-transactions and you will not receive the full game if you only purchase the base game or any of the ""deluxe"" versions, you will be putting more money in to receive more game. Do yourself a favor, go play Baldur's Gate 3 and get a well rounded game that is updated for free with no gimmicks.",1665018712,1701643059,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There is a lot to do in just this base game. You can avoid paying for moonstones for the most part. You can earn moonstones daily in the game as well. The energy bar does not work like in mobile freemium games. It cannot be refilled by spending money in the real world. It can only be refilled by eating food, sitting down, or entering your house. It is worth the price of the cheapest edition IMO. The more expensive tiers just give you more cosmetics which may or may not fit your style. Just remember just like in real life you don't need to get everything available for purchase for real money. There is plenty that comes with the cheapest edition of the base game.

Does Dreamlight Valley have micro transactions? Yes. 

Do any of them pertain to the main story? No. 

Character bundles are mostly clothing options and trivial side stories (that add nothing to the story and are basic fetch quest) for each character. There are currently two. The other thing is the premium shop. These sell clothes, items, and skins for your houses that are all cosmetic. Not needed for the function of the game. 

Can you spend real money? Yes. But you can also earn in game currency to buy those items too. This used to be achieved by finding blue chest around the valley once per day and getting 10 moon stones. Now they give you 50. Plus you can earn hundreds to thousands of moon stones each week by participating in weekly fashion or decorating challenges. These do not require a lot of thought to be honest. You just make sure your picture has the right number of that style and vola! I have never gotten under 400 moon stones. 

Does it still take time to get to the 4000 needed for each character? yes. But at least it is do able. 

I hate micro transactions with a passion, and I still wish they didn't, but I think Dreamlight is doing okay with it. Nothing is needed to play the core game. 

As for the DLC, that is the same to me as the Happy Home Paradise option in Animal Crossing New Horizons, since it has a completely new game mechanic to it. 

As for my review of the game. It is lovely and very much an Animal Crossing meets Disney hybrid. Would recommend for that.",1701627969,1701627969,True,47,7,0.641273915767669678,0,True,False,True

Originally they said the game would eventually be free-to-play, so microtransactions for cosmetics made some sense with the way the game industry currently operates (though I would argue that cosmetics should be considered fundamental aspects of a decorating game). Now they've walked that back, so after paying full price for a game, you still have to pay for content within that game. And the prices are RIDICULOUS. $20 for three pieces of furniture. $15 for one house skin, or for a questline and a character skin. Before the game is even out of early access, they're doing a paid DLC.

 - Very cute personal quests with different characters. The dialogue is charming and it makes you feel like you are forming friendships with your childhood faves, which is one of the biggest appeals of the game.
 - Really nice character customization options and clothing.
 - Interior Design is fun and intuitive, as is customizing your Valley.
 - Generally just a very charming art direction.
 - Has a better crafting system and storage system than Animal Crossing, which is clearly an inspiration. It also has a much neater UI and doesn't waste your time with dialogue trees when you just want to buy something from the shop or give a Villager a gift.

Cons:
 - The game is still in early access, and it shows. Outside of daily chores and customization, there isn't much else to do. The current asking price for the game feels too high, especially considering the next talking point:
 - The game has pay-to-win options in the form of Moonstones, an in-world currency you can pay for with real-world money. This point feels especially scummy since it means you're paying full price for a game that isn't finished yet, and that has the same in-game store as a mobile game.
 - You can only reach Level 10 Friendship with each Villager, which doesn't take that long. Once this is done there really isn't much else left to do with them outside of having them help you with your daily chores.
 - The game follows Carrot-on-a-Stick game design philosophy, where you are goaded with cute/cool rewards into doing lots of grinding. Said grinding is never-ending and gets boring pretty quickly. Instead of creating fun minigames for each resource gathering system, you just click on things until the resources you want are obtained. Combine this with how long it takes to make money in the early game, and it can take a long time to unlock basic features like stalls, shop upgrades, or new areas of the valley.
 - The game seems to have an issue with resource balancing. A lot of people have been complaining about Clay being hard to gather (especially for some very notorious quests) but I personally found Iron to be much more of a hassle. It's a resource needed for a good number of quests, yet it has a low spawn rate and it has to be refined further into Iron Bars to be useable. You're going to have to grind like this game is your nine-to-five in order to build up a decent amount of it.
 - Your personal inventory, along with the inventory for gatherable/craftable resources, is limited. You have to grind to get the ingredients or money required to expand them. Luckily, your furniture storage is unlimited, which helps make the interior design and exterior design features a lot more fun. But it does mean you're going to have to deal with very limited storage for construction materials and cooking ingredients early on.
 - The game has an energy meter that depletes really quickly. As you level up it does grow larger, but you'll often be forced to either head home and rest to recover it, or prep meals in advance to restore it. Having this mechanic doesn't feel like a fun inclusion, but rather a constant obstacle that doesn't add anything to the gameplay loop other than to get in the way of being productive.

TLDR: This is an unfinished, grindy life/farming sim with pay-to-win elements despite being full retail price AND early access. And while there are some fun elements here and there the subpar nature of the main gameplay loop prevents me from recommending it. If you're looking for a fun Disney game, try looking into the Disney Classics Collection here on Steam, it's a bundle of two Lion King and Aladdin platformers from the 90s that are pretty fun. There's also a Hercules game available here. I really wanted to like this game, and there are parts of it that I really enjoyed. But I can't overlook it's faults. Especially when they're asking you to pay as if it were finished... when it clearly isn't.

UPDATE: 

The producers of this game have the gall to release UNFINISHED DLC FOR A GAME STILL IN BETA AND AT FULL RETAIL PRICE. This isn't the sleaziest deal I've seen a game dev try to pull. But it's up there. I understand wanting to re-experience your childhood, but if you want to do that you can just rewatch your favorite Disney movies. There are a lot of better farming/life sims out there. Don't waste your money on this crap. This game doesn't respect it's audience and it isn't worth your devotion.",1696172378,1701560581,False,3,0,0.523634374141693115,0,True,False,True

Buy to Play Standard Game (The game was supposed to go Free to Play but they changed their mind) and Expansions (Not sure but I'm guessing there will be an expac every year)
BattlePass that awards Cosmetics
Premium shop with cosmetics (house skins, outfits, furniture, character outfits, pets, tool skins)
The premium does have character quest packs that unlock extra quests, character skins, outfits, and furniture.

The good:
- it tickles my Disney adult nostalgia brain almost like Disney has been doing this for a century
- avatar design is cute, satisfying and easy to change on a whim anywhere in town
- the rain is *so good* the cloud cover and sounds of the rain make me feel so cozy. When you go inside while it rains, you hear the rain pelting your house. It is an odd thing to notice, but if you are an enjoyer of rain, this game hits the spot
- the interface they give you to edit your valley is intuitive, easy to use, and allows for a lot of creativity. 
- everything you pay for is cosmetic with clear categories: extra player housing, tool skins, character skins. Most everything else you can buy from the daily rotating shop. It also doubles as a pretty solid money sink.
- No max number of villagers and they won't get mad at you and leave. Looking at you Animal Crossing
- this game's Tom Nook, Scrooge, does not give out loans under terms you most certainly not agree to and then tell you that you're now in debt for the rest of your life to him. You commission him and he does the work, all cash paid up front.


The bad:
- Disney is the soulless shell of your childhood and knows you know and also knows you'll buy it anyway
- was going to be FTP buy they were like ""nah, jk. That was bait""
- DLC announced for the same price as the full game and also before early access was even done. It feels really scummy and underhanded
- People justifying the above by going ""pfft you're not a sims player. This is soooooo good in comparison"" Two things can be shitty and scammy. 
- The developer, Gameloft acts like they want your feedback. Again, for an early access game, you would be reasonable for assuming that would be the case. They don't. Their feedback website is not even a link in game. you can't select and copy it, you can't interact with it in any way. If you would like to leave feedback, including reporting a bug, you have to tab out, and manually type the address into your browser. Anyone who works for any business will have seen this. If you want to make customers feel like they can do something because it's expected of your company, but you don't want them to actually do it, make the interface as obtuse and time-consuming as possible and that will deter most audiences from partaking in that feature or part of the product. 
- the story, while fine over all gets to this point where it actually says ""STOP. This next part might make you feel feelings. Some of those feelings might be sad or lonely. If you can't handle watching other people be sad, then you should take a break and come back when you can handle it"" dude, what? Even a preschool game wouldn't give me that warning. This game is marketed primarily to Disney adults. I can see kids enjoying this too, but Disney knows their audience. This is just insulting. 
- this part is petty, but the animations for character relationship level going up are long and unskippable. Missed more than one ""bonus"" moment while foraging or farming or whatever because of it

Conclusion: Even though the ""behind the curtain"" leaves a pretty sour taste in my mouth, Looking at the big picture: Do I have fun with the game? Yes. Do I think others will have fun with the game? Yes. Are the ratio of hours I can satisfactorily put into the game worth the money they ask of me to play? Yes. Will I buy the DLC? Still yes. With those questions answered, I will say I do recommend the game, but if Disney or Gameloft being crappy is something you can't get over, maybe stop playing games all together because they're all like this or worse.",1701280910,1701281619,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

It is very relaxing and love the visuals with their cartoon clean look.

The world is very colorful and lots to do such as gathering materials, decorating, changing your avatar, quests, building friendships, fishing, farming, etc.

The decorating is very good in this game allowing to move even the houses and have the freedom to do what you want however sometimes the mechanics can get a bit frustrating.

Love that we have gotten many free updates and new characters since the game launched which is why I am not bothered about the expansion that is coming  although I don't think it should cost as much as the base game did.

There is a special in game currency called moonstones that you can buy with real money to get special items however you really don't need to since you can do the weekly DreamSnaps and gain it that way and never have to spend real money. It does take a bit longer but really appreciate another option to obtaining this currency. You can also get a daily chest of 50 moonstones. It really makes the game feel like it's not about money.

I really do feel like love is put into this game and I hope they do keep updating and expanding and keep offering more characters, biomes, clothes, furniture, quests, more alternate clothes for other characters, maybe allowing to decorate inside of other character's houses and hopefully other new surprises and interesting things we haven't thought of to keep the game going and feel fresh.

It would be nice however if decorating wasn't stuck to a grid and to give the option to put multiple of the same item when placing an item so that way it doesn't always bring you back to the item screen. Also, an option to to a search with typing to find objects and maybe more filtering options.

But overall I very much recommend this game if you love Disney and farming games.",1669432174,1701134545,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Pros
It's got Disney themed outfits along with a few of their own original outfit designs. Players can customize outfits and furniture so there's a bit of creative freedom. When it comes to designing the Valley, players don't necessarily have to be nearby so it makes running around easier. If anyone is looking for a game that they can play at their own pace without having to get stuck on a quest, this game lets you save whenever it's convenient. The game has in-game currency called Moonstones and at one point, players could only obtain through blue chests found daily randomly in the Valley. However, recently they have been made more available through ongoing weekly and monthly events. You can enter into contests and vote for others in a way to obtain Moonstones. 

Cons
I do love playing this game but there are still some glitches and other annoyances to point out so you know what you're getting yourself into. When in the designer mode to set up furniture, you can design a whole area, but when you try to exit out, the game lags and have to force quit undoing all of your work. There are times when you have to gather enough resources to craft and give for a quest which can get tedious with how you obtain them. If you are looking to play this game in hopes of having access to everything in the game, I will warn you that players will either have to spend more time into the game or pay money. There was a recently added bundle that can be purchased in-game to have access to more quests but it costs more Moonstones than anything else in the game.",1692502293,1701055997,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can only play at night 90% of the time, but since the game runs on real time for some reason, it is difficult (and depressing) to play at night, because it is always dark and characters are sleeping. So the logical solution is to change your system clock to match your own schedule. But then if you change it at all, say, because you play at a different time of day, the game punishes you by causing the resources to stop respawning until it ""catches up"" to the real time. For a game that cost me $100, I would think I could do as I dang well please with the clock.
EDIT: My friend started playing this and it made me decide to continue after a long break. However, there is apparently a game-breaking bug where you are locked out of a quest if you dont do things ""in order"", but they dont tell you what the order is. So after almost 50 hours, it looks like I will have to restart my game.

There are some in game purchases, but you can 100% go without them. The characters are NOT locked behind a paywall and you can unlock them by progressing in the story and when patches come out all you have to do is unlock the doors in the castle to get to the characters and their quest-lines. 
The only thing that costs money is for cosmetic items but you can also earn the moon stones (in game currency) throughout your play through although it is not a lot or super frequent. The other items that cost IRL money are going to be the expansions which further the gameplay, and I don't mind that a ton because most games these days charge for expansions such as cyberpunk or even the witcher 3. 

All in all I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a relaxing game that includes farming and customizing a town and has daily changes. such as animal crossing.

There are tedious parts where you need to grind, but that is expected of this type of game. There is a lot to do throughout it, I am nearly done with all the current quests, but it took me over 100 hours. You don't need to spend real money in the game once you buy it, unless you want to purchase items for looks. As of now, moonstones that can be purchased for real money are used to buy things like alternative houses, decor, and clothes. They are not required for gameplay. 

The only things I dislike are some quests are time-locked. As someone with a busy life, I struggled to get into the game at certain times. Luckily that wasn't most of the gameplay. The characters can get annoying when they get in the way, but that's common of cozy games like this where NPCs wander around.

I am not looking forward to multiplayer. I am hoping nothing will require multiplayer to actually get things done. I like how it currently functions, where you can do everything alone.

I am glad it isn't going F2P, because that reduces microtransactions.

Overall, I'm super into this game. It's very cute, nostalgic, and relaxing. I'm looking forward to the update in Dec 2023.",1700794032,1700794032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You can collect resources, farm, mine, fish, decorate the valley, complete quests, and unlock more characters and level up their friendship. There are also regular updates that add new characters, quests, and items.
However, there are some cons. Disney Dreamlight Valley was intended to become free to play once early access ended. However, that is no longer the case. I think the decision not to be a free-to-play game should have been announced much sooner instead of a month before the game leaves early access. Since the game was supposed to be free to play, numerous paid features exist. On top of the $30+ price tag, there is the weekly rotating Premium Shop, which includes clothing for your character, decor items, house skins, pets, etc., and they cost moonstones, which is the premium currency. Items in the Premium Shop are not cheap, and you can spend $4.49 for a new shirt and headband, $7 for a new pet, and $12 for a house skin. There are also currently two locked quests with WALL-E and Ursula/Vanessa that cost 4,000 moonstones or $14 each. There are several ways you can earn moonstones in the game, including finding the daily chest with 50 moonstones, voting in the DreamSnaps every week for 50 moonstones, and submitting a DreamSnaps picture every week (minimum reward is 300 moonstones). However, you will have to save up to be able to afford the premium items.

I hope it does not get destroy by microtransactions when it releases for free. I prefer if it had a regular price tag and then buy expansion packs or DLC afterwards. This game is similar genre to animal crossing and stardew valley. I believe this is better in a lot of ways and it still has potential for improvements. This game also has sequels writing all over in the near future. Progression in this game was well thought out. Most quest are varied and fun to do. The game is very cheerful, fun and relaxing game. Building and organizing Dreamlight Valley is a delight. Game is still in EA, I keep encounter bugs and glitches. Some of them have been fix quick then new ones and old ones pop up. I am glad there are many quest I can do in the meantime while others quest get bug or stuck in a loop. Some of the items on the store need to be better balance. Items are way to expensive. Let us play offline in the future to future proof my game and investment. Let us have multiple characters so we can experience the game again. While sharing loot between them. Also digging is not fun at the moment needs fixing and to make it worth doing. My idea for digging is to raise the value of coin found while digging (specially treasure chest), Let us find special items for scrooge store or museum in exchange for good amount of coins, and or let us find special items for our villagers for them to decorate their homes. Also dark wood spawn is very low. This game needs Interactive furniture, items which our villagers interact with would be awesome. Ability to do more things with our neighbors. Like go for a picnic, go fishing with pals, invite to hang out at your place (guest would interact with interact-able furniture like someone sitting down to watch tv or eat at the table or play with arcade machine or make dinner for player, etc. At the moment I am disappointed with the microtransactions shops prices. If you want a skin for your house its like 11 dollars. It should be 5 dollars tops. This is just greedy. I am afraid that if devs screw up this will be the end of Dreamlight Valley like the greedy thorns in the game this game will disappear into the void never to be found and no one to play it ever again. I hate bad endings. At the moment I am mix in my review. I hate to give this game a negative review. Instead I will just tell players to wait before they buy. Read more reviews.

It's basically Animal Crossing with The Sims combined, but with Disney sprinkles all over it. Runs smooth like butter, addicting, beautiful world and their Sims 3 Create-a-Style feature put Sims 4 to an absolute shame. Can't wait for what's in store next for the game but right now it's just AMAZING.

Ofc there are some downsides tho, the default mouse sensitivity is too much and needs readjustment. And also can we please have the option to turn off the time sync, i can only play at night so i can't see what the in-game daytime is like.

That being said, the game is still on Early Access so i can see there are still room for improvements, but in the meantime keep up the good work Gameloft.

UPDATE: Time sync can now be readjusted to your liking, i can literally see the sun now.

Aspects I have enjoyed about the game to date:
- Your valley can be customized (to an extent)
- Clothing can be personalized with a ""touch of magic""
- Learning new recipes with Remy
- Visiting Scrooges shop ( inventory changes daily) to purchase items.
- I absolutely LOVE watching Disney Character coming to life interacting with one another
- Characters have rapport levels and items can be unlocked as your relationship grows with them.
- Dream Snaps Challenges was added a couple of updates ago and gives players the chance to earn moonstones ( in game currency ) to purchase items.
- I always get excited to see what items will be on the star paths ( think of it as a to do list ) with the star paths we can unlock more in game items.


Aspects I am less thrilled about:
- With each major update we were receiving new characters that were locked behind their door in the castle. In order to obtain them, we would complete ""dream light duties"" (tasks in the valley) to acquire dream light shares (earned) with these share we then could unlock the doors and obtain the characters. However, with the newest DLC "" A Rift in Time"" there will be at least 3 characters (Eve, Rapunzel, and Gaston that will be locked in with this DLC. 
- Items can NOT be rotated 360 degrees in this game. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but it can be really  cringe for someone that has OCD.
- Certain items and trees can NOT be placed on top of sidewalks even if it's the leafy walk.
- Items are restricted when placing them on the ground or hanging something on a wall. You do NOT have full rein when placing items.
- Currently ""Dream Snaps"" will NOT allow ANY touch of magic items to be submitted. I""m unsure if they will change this in the future. So currently when voting for ""dream snap"" submissions they can be pretty repetitive. Unless you are someone who has most or all items unlock from scrooges shop.

This game has came along way in the year that it's been available to play and I'm looking forward to seeing what other changes are made and what other characters are brought to life. If you like a chill games this could be the game for your :D. And plus who wouldn't want to see Scar and Simba eating lunch together in Remy's Restaurant.

The gameplay is rather simple, but that doesn't mean it's any less fun to play. I'd compare it more with Animal crossing, with a hint of stardew valley (farming sim and village life), so if you enjoy those games you're sure to love this one. 

It adds some really nice QoL features that make life easier compared to other games of the same genre. Watering crops is much more fluid and easy, no need to go one by one. Harvesting crops goes with ease by holding down the button instead of grabbing each one by one, with the extra bonus of grabbing your favorite character assigned to the job that will give you more output while you hang out with them.

Some of the character quests are a bit grindy, but overall it's not too bad. Especially with games like these that can be played very casually, so no rush to get things done. 

Best feature in this game, by far, is the creation tool. Where you can make your own designs for some of the standard clothing to really make things unique to your character.

This game reminds me a lot of Animal Crossing, but with Disney characters, and since I like both, I will say that I love this game, with the possibility of actually being able to spend time with the characters, it makes the game a lot better than it is. We listened to the instrumental music from the classic Disney movies, but for those who like to stream games, it has a friendly streaming option, that is, an option in which the person does not have copy right in the videos again, another point for positive.

The map so far is large with different biomes to explore, with a variation of characters, even for an early access, we have about 17 characters (obviously for the future the game will bring more characters).

Now here's the thing: I bought early access, because I knew I would really like the game, and we know that it will be free in 2023. For those of you who are undecided, if you really like Disney and like games like animal crossing, farming games, then I highly recommend buying the early access (unless you can't afford it), if you are undecided and are not so excited to play that you have to spend money, then I recommend waiting for the release.",1662643118,1700594338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As people already said, the game is a mix of Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley/Harvest Moon. I'm a huge fan of both games, so this was right up my alley. It even got a lot of things better than Animal Crossing, like being able to put buildings and houses exactly where you want them and without having to wait 24 hours for it to be done. There's so many things to do and I feel like there's a carrot hanging in front of me the whole time, and it's hard to stop playing.

I'd say this game is perfect for people who grew up with Disney. But I suppose I'm in the minority to say that I don't think this is a game suitable for younger children, since there is some really hardcore grinding situations. I feel like most kids would grow tired of the game real quick because they would have to wait to unlock certain favorite characters. Even I can feel a bit exhausted after grinding in this game.

Gameloft keep lying through their teeth and breaking promise after promise. What are they gonna lie about next?

[Original review from 22 June]
The game itself is fun enough, but the monetization is getting completely out of hand. They promised no paid DLC or micro-transactions during (paid) Early Access. Well, the game is still in Early Access, yet now we have a premium store in-game which has absolutely insane prices. It's worse than Sims 4 or similarly outrageous games.
2500 Moonstones cost 10€, here's some in-game prices for ""premium"" items:

A house skin: 3750 Moonstones (15€)
An ugly pet (pets do nothing in this game except follow you around, they have zero gameplay function at this point): 2000 (8€)
A skin for Scrooge: 2500 (10€)
A very basic set of skins for your tools (you have 5 tools): 3750 (15€)
Furniture sets (usually like 3-5 pieces) going from around 3000-5000 Moonstones approximately.
(There's also an element of FOMO with these, because there's only 4 items on sale per week and you don't know when or if the one you might want will be back on sale)

They've also started to sell ""character packs"", starting with Wall-E. For 4000 (!!!) Moonstones, you get a skin for Wall-E, a dress and a suit for your character and a short quest line. 
This is all on top of the game's Battle Pass (or ""Star Path"") system (more FOMO, yay!), which it has had from day 1 of early access, and which honestly has been getting worse and worse in quality of the rewards. The premium version costs 2500 Moonstones, but you can earn back around 2000, so it ""only"" costs like 500 if you do everything.",1687441828,1700591727,False,21,1,0.601238131523132324,0,True,False,True

Those who enjoy games similar to Animal Crossing can now experience a life-sim full of heart, soul and immense amounts of joy regardless of platform; especially if they're Disney fans.

[h1]What I Liked[/h1]
✪ There isn't much tied down by a daily limit, aside from daily discussions, a few chests, only being able to buy 25 items from the shop each day and the shop's featured items. Gathering spots, usually notorious in these kinds of games, respawn much more often than I expected them to. Villagers are always available to hang out, chat or gift unless they're sleeping. If you want to upgrade a house or business, the upgrades happen right away instead of making you wait until the next day. Just about everything you do in this game was made to be enjoyed in the moment, allowing you to play however you want until you feel like stopping, then come back whenever you're ready with no consequences.

✪ To unlock new areas and progress in the game's story you'll need to gather Dreamlight, which are points earned by completing a plethora of in-game activities. What you can do, well as how much you earn for each task, is located in a menu akin to challenge trackers in most other games. The more you do, the more Dreamlight you get. The more Dreamlight you have, the more stuff you can do.

✪ There is a surprising amount of variety, from the different kinds of quests you can do, stories you're told and biomes we're currently able to explore. I'm a bit over 45 hours in at the time of writing, and I've yet to feel bored or as if it's time to slow down. New areas are still being unlocked. New characters are still appearing. New quests are being assigned with a whole lot more to unlock, and I haven't even started beautifying my village or home yet.

✪ Character interactions feel authentic despite their limited voice and animation loops, giving the game much more soul than similar titles. It's also well worth interacting with everyone you can thanks to the Friendship feature. The more time you spend with each of the game's Villagers, the more points you get towards your Friendship level with them. Each Villager comes with their own set of rewards that unlock by level, along with the ability to assign tasks that help ease your grind. What's most interesting and impressive though, to me at least, is how conversations with each of the villagers reveal historical, media backed facts about them, rather than simply filling the conversation pool with pointless banter.

✪ Its Battle Pass, appropriately dubbed the Star Path, is off to a good start so far. What's free and premium is made very clear, with a progression style similar to Fortnite's; your ability to go to the next page is determined by how many items you've acquired from prior pages. Premium's price is standard at 2,500 Moonstones ($9.99 USD), and you get 2,175 (87%) back if you make it to the end of the Path. The challenges assigned in order to progress in the pass, dubbed Duties, are also reasonable even at their worst. I just hope that future paths last longer than 34 days.

✪ Character customization is a pretty big deal for me, because I always want to make sure my character looks right. Unfortunately, I always notice an imperfection or two over time and usually can't change that without mods or spending money. Dreamlight Valley allows me to be a nitpicker without punishment by giving us the ability to change everything about our character at any time. All we have to do is open the Wardrobe located in our main menu, and everything we had access to when we started the game is made available again, including gender.

✪ Little details can make a big difference, and I'd hate to litter this review with blips for each one of them, so I'll just list off a few of my favorites here. Your gathering tools are unlimited thanks to magic, removing the hassle of rebuilding or rebuying them. When you're hanging out with certain villagers, or spending time in their homes, their theme songs will play. Characters interact to just about everything you're doing, whether it's fishing, mining or trying to take a selfie with them. What time it is in the game matches what time it is for you in reality, with each of the game's characters having their own scheduled habits. The Collection menu is a real time saver, granting access to a lot of information I'd otherwise have to look for through a Google search. 

✪  The devs have been fantastic, supportive and seem to be really excited for the future of this game so far. Every bug I've reported directly to their Support Center was acknowledged and responded to within a couple days. Comments made on their social media platforms, and within their Discord server, have been transparent and genuinely helpful. We've also been shown quite a lot of what to expect over the coming updates, with hints of more, including multiplayer, on the way. If they keep this up, Dreamlight Valley will have a long and prosperous life ahead of it.

[h1]What I Didn't Like[/h1]
✘ There's no way to check the controls for this game, or reassign keybinds.

✘ The camera, though fun to use, is held back by horrible controls and functionality limitations. Selfies work fine, but trying to line up my shots in its not-so-free mode is usually pretty tedious. A lack of control over the poses and expressions we make is also truly unfortunate. 

[h1]Nitpicks[/h1]
•  The game's characters occasionally speak to each other through speech bubbles. This is fine, but the speed at which the text creeps into each bubble is annoying to me, and I hope we get a way to speed it up down the line.

• It's Early Access, so bugs are to be expected and I experienced quite a few. Fortunately every single one that I experienced was pretty minor, but they were still enough to break the immersion and bring about frustration in a game I otherwise have a great time with.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
Whether you're a Disney fan, someone looking to get their hands on a life-sim with a lot of things to do, or both, Dreamlight Valley is absolutely worth your time. If this review wasn't enough to convince you to get it now, worry not. The game will be free-to-play sometime in 2023.

I beat the game officially in about 100 hours and I still have plenty left to do as far as character quests go so there is no shortage of cute, fun gameplay.

Things I want fixed because they're driving me insane:

• Please add a search bar in the recipes book when cooking. It is organized so stupidly and I hate looking for recipes. 

• I really hope they add the ability to ""track"" a food/crafting recipe that isn't part of a quest.

• The animals having schedules is not only annoying, it's ridiculous. I'm finding it impossible to get on the game to get the pink alligator for instance, which only spawns on certain days from 6-10 am and pm. C'mon.

• Why can't we stack storage chests?

• The ugly shorts underneath the dresses glitching through is PISSING ME OFF. I did not spend 40,000 coins on a mouse sewn Cinderella dress for the shorts underneath that you CAN'T TAKE OFF to glitch through the back when I move. 

• There are not enough cutscenes. However, the cutscenes we do get look great.

• Some people would get mad about this, but the store should be like most games and refresh every 72 hours.

• Lastly, please make Nala's eyes a little more pale yellow because right now she looks like she has fucking jaundice.

Microtransactions are all cosmetic, so if you don't like spending real money on pixels, the dont! They don't force you to buy anything.

Yes a season pass is implemented into a paid game, but it's a $30 game. Some people seem to forget that Diablo 4 (an $80 game) also has a seasons pass + microtransactions.

I just don't get all the gripe behind a DLC being added for more story content. Again, it's a $30 game. If you want the devs to keep pushing Free QoL updates past 1 year after release, DLC and Microtransactions make sense.

They eventually stopped posting about F2P in early 2023.  Then in October 2023, they announced that they're walking back their promise of F2P and moving to a paid full release in December 2023.  They're charging newcomers for the base game, and they're charging everyone for expansions, too.

It bases itself off classic Disney characters but struggles to really find its footing in developing a coherent story line that is actually engaging. You can't just put a bunch of well known personalities together and hope it creates an intriguing game. This does not surprise me though, Gameloft has long been regarded as a company that acquires the rights to big IPs and tragically makes it into a cash grab.

I had pretty high hopes for this one, but as much as I was a Disney kid growing up, and as much potential as the concept had, I'm sorry to say that I just don't think it's worth it. Like most games with a cash shop and 'limited-time event' foundation, the rest of what's there is pretty light on content, and everything quickly felt tedious and samey to me. I lost interest much sooner than I thought I would -- it has the trimmings of cozy sim that I like, but a lot of it feels hollow to me.

I think if you're considering this title for a kid, and you don't mind them constantly badgering you for cash shop items, then it's just fine. If you're somebody who thinks about nothing but Disney, you'll probably also be willing to overlook all of the ways it falls short. But I've been hearing things about how they're intending to run the game going forward that sound pretty predatory to me, so...idk.

I need you to understand I would guzzle new content when a new battlepass came out, I devoured it within a week or more than likely under a week. I was max level and treasured each new character even excusing the fact that when I sent in a game breaking bug they didn't answer I excused it. (I can't continue the story line because something never spawned). I  bought the first deluxe and then the next level, I was going to buy the third level because I loved the game. Assuming if they did add new characters it would be a small DLC price. 
What was recently released that has me putting this game down is the pricing. It was supposed to come out as F2P it isn't, the pricing I believe will be $40 release, and then the DLC which you will need to continue the main story will be $30. Now that isn't great and those who have bought before the release date, will get the costumes and some of the things from the $40 release which is nice. 
However, that $30 DLC has two characters Gaston and Cinderella and i guess a new place, I wasn't impressed.
However, that isn't the end there is now an expansion pass. And do not get me started on the prices in the in game store. We are talking $20 for a skin. This game is far too expensive to play. It is a money grab. What I was so excited and feel so guilty for recommending now for people to play is now doing a huge money grab. Fortnite is cheap compared to this. $30 DLC, An Expansion Pass, $20+ store items and who knows what else. There will apparently be free characters but how are we supposed to believe their word anymore? They also said it was free to play on release. I feel very disappointed in this game. I guess I should have seen the money grab coming from Disney..... I guess I should have expected it but I didn't. 
It is okay to charge for your work but what they are doing is past that. They are nickle and diming you and putting out enough characters hoping you will stay with them. Like oh look Jack Skellington is in December you don't want to leave right? RIGHT? Nightmare before Christmas is one of my favorite movies and I am still setting this down. Oh also they are locking sprinklers and auto cooking behind the DLC paywall lol! When those should be part of the base game. 
If you asked a few months ago I would have said yeah its a good game. Now we are looking at a newcomer expected to pay $70 base for the game & DLC to poay the storyline, that is bigger and more than a AAA game. That isn't including whatever the expansion pass will be. And doesn't include the battle pass price as well.....
Oh last thing is the multiplayer they have been advertising is just going to be you going to someone else's world look at it place a house and shop at Scrooge's. That is it....",1699852005,1699852194,False,12,0,0.597547233104705811,0,True,False,True

recently checked to see how the game was doing still hoping they might have gotten to that hotfix and saw DLC, ""huh, they finally got out of early access? when did that happen"" was my first thought.
but no, $30 DLC for an unfinished Early Access game.

-The different clothing choices are pretty and make sense

-The game is easy to play; daily rewards are nice; the shop always updates daily

Things I don't like:
-The game can be buggy at times with slow implementation of updates/bug fixes
-There is a limit to how many items you can buy at Scrooges shop to a daily amount of 25 items
-Your energy while playing drains really fast; it changed from being able to walk into your house to recharge your energy to having to constantly eat food and sit down to replenish energy

After playing for 400+ hours, I can't say I have any excitement left for what's to come of this game. 

Gameloft has since went back on that free to play promise as well as lock characters who were originally advertised in the beginning behind a pay wall. There are other characters who were shown in the original teaser trailer that we still don't have any information for when they'll be arriving in the valley. Will we have to pay for those as well? The game has started to feel like an advertisement. New pixar movie? That'll be the focus of the starpath. New Disney movie? Here's a new character that was never mentioned previously that you can have but you can't have the ones from the trailer. 

If you are someone looking to get this game, you won't be able to get previous star path reward items. The devs have stated that star paths will not repeat, so there's countless items you're automatically missing out on. You can however get exclusive premium shop items but they are set at a high moonstone rate. You can earn moonstones by participating in dreamsnaps, but often times the dreamsnap topic is something to do with the last weeks premium shop items, so if you didn't buy them you already have less items to contribute. 

I feel it's also important to mention the characters are time gated. If they are in their house sleeping you cannot interact with them. Collecting companions comes with a very similar problem, but they are restricted to specific days as well. These times and days do not change. If you are only able to play at certain days and/or times, you will miss out. I cannot recommend this game to new players. 

Seeing as I've put so much time into this game already, I will keep up with the announcements and I will keep this review updated.",1699508113,1699508113,False,9,0,0.534027457237243652,0,True,False,True

so my original review was when i was first starting out in the game. lol. so much has happened since and i still love it. all the negative reviews because its not gonna be free to play is kinda overkill, is it a bummer? kinda,but i have zero regrets having paid for the game. you can earn the digital currency in game super easy so no real need to complain about forking out extra money when minimum effort has gotten me at least 1400 moonstones a week for a 5min picture and have been able to get everything i want from the weekly store. will say some items are priced crazy but again do the weekly bs and get it without having to pay extra. the new expansion is optional, it doesn't effect the games main plot line, they made that 100% clear. we pay for DLC on so many games already that DDV isnt a surprise to have to pay for extra content  which was also clear to be happening from the start. so people who are negative on this and complaining for the sake of ""streamers and content creators"" like...im sorry i play games for FUN not to get likes and followers lol.

1. A section for ""orders"" in recipes while cooking in Remy's restaurant.
2. The amount of items in a stack should be 100 instead of 50 for all items.
3. There should definitely be an option to cook more than one meal at a time.
4. Recipes being sorted by stars, energy level, etc.
5. I don't really get why outfits for the Disney characters would be a paid thing..? Make us earn them through questing, sure.. but pay for them? As far as other paid content and the ability to buy moonstones, whatever. Doesn't bother me at all. If y'all really thought they weren't going to have micro-transactions, well.. since when do any big companies tell the truth? 
6. The re-spawn rate of some things needs to be faster (the forgetting mostly).
8. The Event Path quests really need work. For example, quests for characters that you don't have yet shouldn't trigger (I, luckily, don't have this issue anymore, but I'm sure some people do). Quests that take multiple days should give you more of a reward than what they do currently.
7. Why is the player home so BIG? 

Glitches:
1. Disney characters heads and hands sometimes move around randomly.
2. If I am wearing a dress, you can see my shorts come through the dress when I bend over doing tasks.
3. Sometimes while doing a quest for collecting an item for a character, when I go to turn that item in, the ""give item"" screen will get stuck and I will have to force close the game and restart.
4. Not really a glitch, I suppose, but on the quest for Scar, when you're growing the plant (I forget the name of the quest), it says it could take a few days.. and it took a week for me, so don't panic if it takes more than a few days.

Other than that, it's a pretty cute game, I think. I'm pretty excited for the new characters to be released in December since I'm out of things to do and currently just stockpiling supplies and decorating. Is it odd that there's an expansion being released during early access.. yup. Do I actually care enough to cause a fuss about it or change my recommendation to a thumbs down? Nope.

It's Disney characters and story line meets Animal Crossing gameplay, if you like that you'll like Dreamlight Valley. 

Sound: 5/5  - Each character has a musical leit motif that will be familiar to any disney fan, and the sound work for the game itself is lovely. I've put a zen garden in my character's room with a fountain that gives me a lovely white noise water to listen to while I'm sorting inventory or crafting.

Graphics 3/5 - The game is pretty, but several characters are off-model from Disney standard, and the game's creation mode is pretty sparse in terms of actual capability, which draws attention to the limitations of the graphics.

Gameplay 5/5 - Again, it's a cozy game. If you like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing you'll like this, if you don't this isn't going to change your mind.

Story: 10/5 -  You may notice I've broken my own metric there. That's because the game broke all my expectations story wise. I was expecting the usual light, cozy story, just enough to keep me invested in the gameplay loop. Instead I got a true Disney-style story focus on themes of childhood, adolescence, adulthood, what it means to grow up, and what it means to remember your inner child.  This game even has a chapter that requires a trigger warning before you embark, and it's a well deserved one; many players reported having to take a time out after that chapter just to calm down and find a box of tissues.",1699459612,1699459612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's a fun game, but it's marred by numerous forms  predatory monetization so I can't recommend it unless it's at a steep, steep discount, ideally free to play (Which the devs were going to do, but the company decided to instead just charge full price for it) . The game is full price, and has paid DLC that is as much as a full price game, and then it has extremely expensive in game purchases that capitalize off of fear of missing out and nostalgia. There are season pass like purchases, then there are things you can purchase for the game not in those season passes at all times, that rotate constantly. The game was built as a good game, then stripped bare bones and they made the parts they stripped away paid parts.

The game is fun, in like an animal crossing way. But imagine in animal crossing you see a cool piece of furniture and it costs you 5 or 10 dollars in real life money.  Or you see a character that you like to find out their locked behind an expansion pass. Or you see an event like the thanksgiving or Christmas event and it's a timed event that you have to buy the season pass for it, then to get furniture or collectibles from it you have to spend even more in real world money to get them.  The other thing majorly wrong with this is the fact that even the most bare-bones Animal crossing game has more content in it.



If you buy it you must go into it thinking of it like a farming/social sim if you plan to buy the game only with no desire to spend past full price. You won't be able to decorate your house or village  as you want without spending money on micro-transactions on it

They might say ""you get free Moonstones *in game currency* just by playing the game! save up and buy it latter"". Easy to say for everyone who owned this game already and gathered a fair amount of Moonstones before all the customisation/decorations/DreamBundles released.
Assuming the game keeps the daily chest at 50 Moonstones. For 30 days everyone only accumulates 1.500 Moonstones. With each week rotating the item shop, and most items being around 1,500 - 3,000. Assuming the players log in everyday and collect their moonstone chests. (if you miss 2-3 days, the blue chest will spawn a second and maybe third time, on the same day).

""What about DreamSnap, you can get a lot of moonstones every Wednesday!"". Assuming you have collected a decent amount of furniture/decorating items and/or outfits, to participate and do well in. ( Most outfits and furniture are bought with gold, not moonstones). DreamSnaps are not so ""giving"" because these are real people with the game, judging. If you have a ""messy"" background and incoherent scene for the DreamSnap event, don't expect people to choose yours over someone else. 
With rewards being 300 - 8500 moonstones, about 4-5 times a month (every Wednesday). And with no effort a nice 1,200 moonstones for every 4th Wednesday. Its defiantly generous. 

All positives of this game, can always be followed up with a foul taste in your mouth. The bigger picture is to make money off you. A slow burn. 
If you or the person you're buy this for, has a bad case of FOMO (fear of missing out) Do NOT buy this game. Every week the item shop switches out 4 items, and each item can range from 7 - 30$ (because Disney grouped them into packs/bundles, you cant buy exact amount for 1 item).

The game is fun. An stardew valley or animal crossing like game with a Disney skin. The game and the stuff to do in said game is fairly good and honestly there is a ton to do with the free content. However, The game was designed with a free to play style. There are these monthly challenges which used to be free now you have to pay a portion of the in game currency to access. If you play the game regularly you can obtain about 50 of this currency a day but if you lack funds you have to shell out cash. I wasn't too bummed about this because it is mostly cosmetics and you can see for the month if it's worth it to build up towards. Then that whole wall-e side story bundle came out. Again uses in game currency for a little hour long story and some cosmetic items if you needed to buy it its $30!!!! I was really concerned about that direction. Then it comes out they're not making it free to play anymore. So what now we pay $30-$60 for the game that has a free to play UI, filled with micro-transactions and also side stories that cost money as well as a $30 DLC?? 
Again, I've played the game. I was impressed by it at first. But I was playing it going ""Wow this has bugs but is decent. Really excited for people to play this. Can't believe we're getting a cool new free to play disney game"" I never had a lot of negative opinions because I always had in my head that this was going to be a free to play experience by the end of it. I told a lot of my friends about it, some with kids. And I definitely thought it was kind of a tight rope walk to have micro-transations in a game with a lot of things kids would like. It's not much different from a fortnight skin so it doesn't matter too much. It's just weird because animal crossing styled games are kind of built on cosmetics and characters and hiding them behind paywalls seems greedy especially now considering the game is no longer going to be free to play now. 
It really is a shame. I mostly wanted to vent and voice my issues because it feels like the UI set up around duties and the monthly or holiday themed cosmetic items were going to be the sole source of income for this game and I thought that would work. It makes me sad because I cant open this game with any joy anymore. I have all the characters available and so I usually played the monthly stuff to pad out things and obviously get cosmetics while waiting for the next update but that's not possible anymore without paying money. The side content stuff looks nice but not $30 nice. That's the price of a new indie game for an hours worth of content and some virtual costumes... The future stuff they announced looks fun but genuinely so much money expected on the consumer. I can't imagine a kid playing this and getting upset that mom and/or dad wont let them get the $30 costume pack in this game. 
I know I may sound harsh or dramatic, just really upset about the recent claims made for this game.

TLDR; Game was fine when announced it would be free to play, now it seems like they got greedy. UI built for a Free to Play style game and has too many micro-transactions to now be a full priced game.",1699387032,1699387032,False,12,0,0.56296771764755249,0,True,False,True

TLDR: No, this game is not worth the total price they are asking for. Gameplay length is about 30 hrs as of writing this, the rest of the time was decorating for different seasons before getting frustrated with the glitchy decorations not saving when leaving the build mode. 

So, with that in mind; this game does not have enough content to warrant the continuously increasing price. The game play is decent and has an interesting decoration system but a grindy crafting system tacked on to it. The cooking is decently in-depth but will give you carpal tunnel if you keep at it for any length of time (and the quality of life to let you batch cook will be locked behind a premium pay-wall). It's a shame there's not really much point to the cooking system other than to cook large amounts of items to make money which gets super grindy to say the least, there's a restaurant where you can serve about 4 characters at a time but they just continue to sit there till it's time to shift them out. You feed them, you don't feed them it makes no difference; so no satisfying reason to interact with the system.  

You will get the characters unlocked and leveled up in pretty short order, along with completing their questlines. 

This is a gathering, farming, mining lifesim without the actual depths of most of the other lifestyle sim games on the market for an insanely cheaper price point. 

If you are going to employ all 4 pillars of monetization you better have a the best game ever made and this game fall very short. Also, using the excuse of 'devs need to make money' is simply nonsense, there are a million games on the market that are paid game/free to play games that seem to stay afloat with a fraction of the price and monetization methods that are used in this game.

Logging on everyday to do the dailies and farm a bit became a habit like brushing my teeth. I was having *so* much fun and experiencing an endless amount of gender euphoria...until they introduced micro transactions. I bought a couple of things then I realized exactly the breakdown of how much real money I was paying versus how much I was getting. It's WAYYYY too expensive. I slowly dropped my time spent in Dreamlight Valley until I just wasn't playing it anymore. If the store was starting out this predatory, I knew it would get worse and I didn't want to be there to see it or spend it. I am incredibly sad a game with this much soul and potential turned into this. I cannot recommend this anymore and will probably never open this game again. Thanks for the fun times, Dreamlight Valley. Time to wake up.

Old review from September 2022: When I tell you that this is the MOST FUN I HAVE HAD IN A GAME IN A LONG TIME. I have 80ish hours so far in it. I have unlocked everything, levelled up everyone, farmed everything. That's 80 hours to do that for an early release game!!!! This is definitely worth the 30 bucks right now. I cannot freaking wait for more content. I love this game so much. It's made me cry three times. Also, none of the customizations are gender locked except the lashes...so my ""boy"" character can wear dresses.

My main issues I've found so far:

1. It costs WAY too much to expand inventory. To go from default to 28 (which is only an extra 7 spots) is 5K, with the next 7 spots jumping all the way to 20k. for 20K, the whole inventory should be unlocked. (NEW) Having gone further in the game it has become clear that it costs a RIDICULOUS amount of money to do much of anything in this game, while there is not enough stuff available to make money.

2. You only get 5 storage spots in your house, and then require a house upgrade. But the upgrade is much later in the game, so it's useless at the beginning.

3. Sticks spawn constantly, while flowers take upwards to 45 min...yet many of the starting quests require you have flowers, not sticks. BUT if you try and collect them all, you run out of inventory, so you have to sell them in order to get the money needed to expand the inventory.

4. You cannot change what each friend can help you with. So if you are new and don't understand how it works, you can end up with everyone helping you for only 1 activity and you have no way of fixing it. That needs to be fixed.

(NEW) 5. Too many items are placed in unreachable spots, making it impossible to complete quests. Hopefully this gets resolved ASAP as it is quickly degrading my enjoyment of the game.

I'm currently at the beach, so this is just a preliminary review. But for now, those are my main issues I've come across so far.


EDIT 11/5/2023: I paid the money for the Founders Pack on the promise this was going to be a free to play game, and promoted it as such on my streams and online interactions with others when asked about games to play. For the company to go against their word and turn this into a massive money grab makes me not want anything to do with this company and any other game they make in the future.",1662968206,1699238667,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This really sucked, because I loved the underlying story to the game. The story itself is actually really beautiful and heartwarming, something I'll probably be holding close to my heart for years to come.

Unfortunately, instead of leaning into the wonderful writing, the game seems to be focused far more on everything that made ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" flop, in my opinion. Those features include logging on everyday to buy new furniture and collect crafting items... for new furniture. The decorating is fun, don't get me wrong, but the game leans on that alone being a reason to log back in once the story is complete. And with a good chunk of decor being locked behind micro transactions... well.... it leaves a lot to be desired.

The dialogue is repetitive. Charming, at first, but the solo interactions with villagers are bland and the interactions between other villagers is too rare to constitute as something to look forward to. Once you reach max friendship with a villager, I really don't see a reason to talk to them anymore. It's just not fun. I don't look forward to opening the game and only have the hours I do have on it because I wanted to be ready for updates.

I love what Disney Dreamlight Valley does well: providing updates of content that feels like it belongs in the game and overall tells a unique story that brought me comfort and made me feel things for the characters. Unfortunately, there's just so much the game is missing on such a core level. It feels like the care and love put into the story didn't extend at all into the game play. The game feels hollow, devoid of passion.

TLDR; Overall- I guess it was fun for the first 100 hours. And I'm sure about 40 of those hours were me messing around waiting for an update.",1666252981,1699231535,False,0,0,0.492325127124786377,0,True,False,True

Said DLC that upon release will only be a third of the way finished? CRAZY. Sad to think that the game was advertised as free-to-play with a season pass that has turned into a micro-transaction monster. We were told major content won't be locked behind paywalls, yet here we are, will multiple new biomes and characters only unlockable through DLC. While I could understand if this was a year or two post-early access, its not. Haven't even left it yet. Don't get me wrong, the current content is great! The stories are captivating and I always find myself having something to do. However, I shouldn't have to be dumping hundreds into a game to unlock everything.

To elaborate, the costume/quest pack for individual character is 4,000 moonstones (premium currency) the closest pack is 5,500 moonstones- $20. As of review, there is two of those already, one for WALL-E and Ursula. How do they expect people to pay for base game, however many DLC they plan on releasing, and almost $20 for cosmetic pack per character? At this rate, wouldn't surprise me if they did multiple per character. 

The company does not listen to its fan base. They only see us as cash cows. Save your money- get a game where you as a player are valued as more than just a wallet.

What a kick in the face when I paid for this game, and very quickly used up the extra moonstones on only 2 star paths, only for the game to soon become F2P with an insanely expensive premium store.

Edit: Now it's not even going F2P, so they're both going to make you pay for the base game, pay for DLC's, pay for more skins and content. It's depressing to see games - and especially Disney branded games - go this direction more and more. End edit.

The pros:
- All the characters you know and love.
- Great character & world customisation .
- Restoring the valley and opening new areas is somewhat satisfying.
- Buying items from Scrooge's shop is good.
-  The mostly beautiful graphics.

The cons:
- The premium store / star path. 
- The grind - so many hours wasted mining iron ore. Then again and again.
- The real time sync - so often characters you need to talk to are asleep if you can only go on at night.
- The lighting / contrast in some areas, especially the Glade of Trust. I can barely see the ground here.
- Completing the puzzles - I've put in over 200 hours and barely put a dent in finding all the pieces.

I actually don't care about the game anymore and have stopped playing. The idea of the grind and unobtainable items is too much so I've given up. There's not much else to do when you've finished the characters quests.

It is one of those games where you will say to yourself ""I am just going to do a little more mining then come off"" and then 4 hours pass....

If you enjoyed animal crossing then this is the game for you! I don't bother with making my Island look ""pretty"" but there is a lot of grind to get done for resources and achievements which I enjoy (Plus a bit of competitive play as I try to catch up with my partner)!

The only thing that I will say is the their are quite a few bugs right now, while they are rare and kinda funny they aren't game breaking.

Edited info: I understand that people are mad about the game not going free to play and they have the right to be, but please do not post incomplete information when you are posting the review. There are a couple of things I will start off with, the content updates to the base game are staying free, only the expansion is the paid content and we are getting 4 characters with the expansion + 3 new biomes and some other items as well pretty much its going to be as big as the base game. The premium shop is cosmetic items and so is the star path, those do cost money HOWEVER with the current dream snaps feature in the game you can easily save up enough moonstones to buy those items without having to pay a dime. The game is being officially released on dec 5 along side the expansion pass. If the game went free to play people would complain that they would have to buy items (the devs have to make money somehow). Having the game stay paid is still giving everyone the chance to get moonstones without having to pay and same goes for the future base game content. I do also want to mention that if you do have the game now or buy it before december 5th you will get a house skin, 2 premium clothing items, a companion and 2500 moonstones.

TLDR:  Great game. Tons of content...hundreds of hours of play without spending any additional real money. Worth the price. Must be able to read in order to play.

I'm thankful that I went against my fears after reading many reviews who complained about it being a game where you are constantly being encouraged to spend money.  This is far from true.  You can play this game for 100s of hours and still find more to do.  I purchased the game with the Deluxe Bundle for a bit over $40, and have played for over 35 hours.  This is a game similar to Minecraft....in that if I want an item I have to grind for the materials and progress far enough through the game to ""craft"" or ""brew"" that item.  Can you choose to spend real money for special purchases, yes....but doing so isn't necessary to play the game.  Some people were complaining that in order to get new content (DLC) it cost money.  It absolutely should cost more to add additional quests and challenges to a game that is appropriately priced and already has hundreds of quests in the base game.

If you enjoy sandbox type games with added adventures, you will love this game.  There are so many things to do, but without the stress of ""losing"" if you don't it right now or fast enough. If you don't feel like accomplishing any quests, you can fish all day with Goofy, garden, and then cook amazing food that you can sell for big profit so that you can buy bigger and better things in the game or you can craft them yourself.  Or you can take the impatient route, and literally pay to play because you don't want to invest the time to work your way through the game.  But if you chose the latter, you shouldn't leave negative reviews for this game that has been nothing but enjoyable.

My only complaint is that the dialog is minimal, and the majority of communication happens through text.  After playing Detroit: Become Human, it took a minute for me to adjust to having to read again.

This game is extremely fun and worth the money to play early access IMO. There are so many activities and things to do. This is 1000% like animal crossing, but better as well. 
I love watching my little ice cream crocodile follow me around while I [spoiler] mine for gems or go fishing for rare fish. [/spoiler] >_<
You never run out of things to do. I can't wait for the things that get added to the game later on.

A TIP FOR NEWCOMERS: Make sure that you download the dreamlight avatar creation demo FIRST before you buy the game. You will be able to get a code at the end so you can transfer your created character into the full game.
If you buy the game first and try to install the Dreamlight avatar creation demo, it will not work because the paid game replaces it for some reason.

If you happened to already buy the game while reading this review, nothing to worry about! Just get a second steam account that you don't use and that doesn't already own 'Disney Dreamlight Valley' and create your character there. You can still transfer that code to your MAIN steam account with the owned game. It will work like a charm and you only have 24 hours before the code expires.

ALSO, I recommend creating your character beforehand.

It is so addicting trying to get all the starpass rewards and completing quests, the villagers are so fun to have around and be able to do your everyday activities with such as mining, fishing and harvesting.
I was one of those people who was obsessed with animal crossing but wished I had it on PC and this is it! This is basically Disney Animal Crossing / stardew valley but I think it is a better animal crossing because the villagers have alot more meaning to the game, they are involved in the quests and you can hang out with them to give you extra things like crops and gems.

I can no longer recommend this game.
The decision not to go f2p is fine, what annoys me is that I paid for the highest tier expecting to have all the bits and pieces needed to experience the whole game.
Lo and behold, there's a paid expansion coming along with v1.0.
So sad that it started out good but this company is no different to the plethora of others who see the $$ and lose all sense of creating a good, fair experience.
$30 for one NPC skin?!?!?!?
The monetisation is OUT OF CONTROL in this game and now you also have to buy in to v1.0!!
I wish I could get a refund, I really don't want to support predatory monetisation.

Below is my original review: it is indicative of the state of the game not long after Early Access release.

This is a good game for people who are fans of Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley.
There is generally lots of stuff to do but I quickly reached the level cap and now new content is drip fed through the events, its kind of like a battle pass I suppose...ew.

The Disney characters are fab and the voice actors are really good at impersonating their character. It's a wee world you can make your own, i think my only gripe is space. It would be good if they could extend the areas we have as the characters house are big! With the expansion though we are getting new areas so hopefully we can shuffle some characters about now to make room for designing. All in all i say go for it, its good to jump on when its just one of those evenings you want to game but just don't have the energy to concentrate lol",1698881719,1698881719,True,4,0,0.525131046772003174,1,True,False,True

The fact that they switched this from being a Free-to-Play game to a paid game with f2p aspects just destroys any goodwill I had left for this game. I will most likely be dropping this completely and go back to Animal Crossing. 

TL;DR : Don't buy this now just wait for free to play. It's very micro-transaction heavy already. You will not be able to collect everything in the game or be able to play through all quests currently in-game without using real world money or grinding forever (and you still might miss it because they are time sensitive, ie: Wall-E quest pack) I don't recommend this game, just play Animal Crossing New Horizons, it's overall better imo.

I'd like to start with I was extremely excited about this game coming out, as I've purchased the Ultimate Edition and put in over 300 hours at this point. Probably would've put more hours in, but everything I've learned while playing, has caused me to slow down because I just don't see the game going down a good path anymore unfortunately.
That being said I'm very sad about this game. Therefore I would NOT recommend it to anyone ever. 

If you're into just kinda casually playing and interacting with some disney characters then it's not bad I guess you could play it. I'd say this is basically disney's version of Animal Crossing, and it's not better. There are some mechanics that this games does better the AC but there are a lot of things they do worse or just don't really make sense for this kind of game. I'm always 100% against having a clock system based on real world time without giving players the freedom to time-travel if they miss events or timing of quests, something which the newest AC improved because we all know this is how most people play these games. Real life happens and you can't always drop everything just for some mediocre game. 
Also they are now putting gameplay behind pay walls and are already planning for paid DLC (means even more content behind pay walls), which doesn't sit right with me, as this is going to be a free-to-play game. 
So it seems to me like this game will be going down the same path as EA with how they handle the SIMS4. Everything going forward in this game is going to be a cash grab.

I can't support games where the main goal of the creators is purely money. I did some math and the moonstones exchange rate is based on what tier you buy you're getting as little as 240 moonstones per $1 USD and as much as 290 moonstones per $1 USD however these packs cost $5 and $50 respectively. You cannot buy anything in the shop for like less that 1000 moonstones. The Wall-E add-on costs 4000 moonstones and that comes with a quest-line that you cannot acquire anyway but by purchasing it with the moonstones. To fully complete the Star Paths you have to spend 2500 moonstones every time only getting back 2000 while completing the star path, so you're always losing 500 moonstones, therefore you have to login everyday to collect them from some in-game chests that you have to search the world for so more grinding or real world cash.

In conclusion at this point I'm kinda done with this game. I'll probably finish the star path I am currently on so it's not a full waste of the 2500 moonstone, but dam I feel kinda cheated and am very disappointed in this project. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth after spending like $70 on it when I'm ultimately gonna drop and go back literally to any Animal crossing game over this. Honestly I'd rather play OG Animal Crossing and get yelled at by Resttti for playing with the time and not saving instead of this cash grabby sadness.",1687233006,1698880418,False,13,0,0.566821753978729248,0,True,False,True

Edit 11/1/23
The game is getting a lot of hate right now for not becoming F2P like it was supposed to originally people feel lied to and cheated because of it that they had always planned to do this I personally don't agree

I feel like they had a business plan but they realized to make the game good and a viable source of income they had to change it into a flat purchase game which is fair and they did give us a warning of like a month before it happens 

You can still purchase the founder packs and get all the stuff from them plus a lot of moonstones as well

Personally I would rather just pay the price I need to pay for the game then have a bunch of microtransactions or ads or who knows what clogging up the game so they can hopefully deliver the best product possible given that I have played the game for over 200 hours in early access which I paid for and the gaming experience has been amazing I have really enjoyed it given I've played so much of it in the past year lol

And people are mad about some characters being a part of a paid expansion which is fair You won't get some characters if you don't get it but the game will still be playable You can still enjoy and have fun with the game and also The Sims does the exact same business model where they will release expansion packs to enrich the game You don't have to buy them 

and it's not like we're going to have to buy one of these expansions every month In the showcase they had this day they showed that they had free including the original release on December 5th planned releases for this paid expansion up to the summer of next year 

That's months of content that's extra on top of all of the amazing free updates they planned for for the upcoming year if I have to pay 30 bucks a year to get a little bit extra for the game I'm down for it

But I understand if you're disappointed you're upset you're mad and you want to take it out on this game That's your decision your choice and not my business really on what you do but personally I feel like this was the best choice to see the game thrive and still be as good as it has been",1666543375,1698879323,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

When this came out it was super fun. Definitely a game that people who enjoy AC/Stardew/Sims and other similar titles would like. Since their EA launch, they've done nothing but try to monetize as many things as they can (and unreasonably priced, at that). 

I stopped playing when they introduced their store. They were charging $20 for 3 pieces of furniture in a game primarily about questing and decorating? For context, you can place up to 6000 total objects in your valley/town. To be fair they offer a lot of objectives you can get through gameplay and a small amount of premium currency, but at $20 for 3 items you're just trying to bleed people (probably kids and their parents given this is a Disney game) dry. I thought about changing my review at the time, but since the game was INTENDED to be F2P on release a greedy cash shop wasn't unexpected. Almost every F2P game I've played has a overpriced store so while it sucked, it was nothing new. 

I finally decide to change my review to negative at seeing they have gone back on their word about making this a free to play title. In fact, it looks like the box price is actually going to increase compared to the early access price? 

The argument for egregious microtransactions in F2P games is that the developers still need to make money too on their product.

I let a lot of things slide since the game was always advertised as going f2p eventually but now that's not the case. I would still recommend it (although on sale) because I personally had fun with the game but there are a lot of problems people should be aware of before purchasing in case any of these are a deal breaker. I have 200+ hrs in the game HOWEVER, that is due to several seasonal events (star paths) and completing those. As you get to be a more seasoned player, you'll get through the events a lot quicker and gameplay becomes a little mundane again.

Cons:
-There are still bugs and glitches that have been present since the beginning such as Characters blocking you into corners and not allowing you to move unless you teleport (it used to be only the taller characters but now it's happening with shorter characters too). Visual glitches, visual quality dropping, lag while cooking, characters disappearing and reappearing,  freezing while interacting with characters and more
-Micro-transactions: They were very pricey for small items before but I justified it (never purchased though) because again, the game was supposed to move to F2P at official launch but now it's very over priced packages for 1-2 cosmetics and you still have to pay for DLC expansion
- Gameplay becomes repetitive very quickly. Daily tasks and star path tasks are recycled so often it tends to get tedious and boring. There's no much to do at all once you get a character to level 10 friendship besides collecting materials you may need for future character quests.
-Character interaction gets repetitive after you level them up to friendship 10. You'll hear multiple lines over and over again. No new missions once they are level 10. They are basically just there for fill in the village and help you collect extra items when following you. 
-Story feels rushed. Towards the end of the story it feels rushed and thrown together. Kinda like they had a plan but once they knew they were switching to keeping it a paid game, they had to hurry up and conclude the story to justify the DLC expansion. 
-New characters are now behind a paywall. 

Pros: 
-If you are a Disney fan and don't mind spending essentially $60 for a life sim game (and who knows how much for potential future expansions), you'll love it.
-Interacting with the characters is fun while it's fresh
-Getting some of the iconic outfits from the movies 
-Collections are relatively easy and fun to complete
-First half of the gameplay was very fun and mysterious

With the recent news of expansion packs the game is way too expensive for it to have been marketed as a free to play when fully released.

I knew cosmetics could be bought but they are so expensive for what they are. 3000 moonstones is around 12.50 and that is for a single item. If it was a complete set then great but it's 1 item.

There are lots of Professions, (Harvesting, Foraging, Digging, Mining, Fishing) The Quests are trivial but tell a nice story. There Are Story Quests, Realm Quests and Friendship Quests you are progressing through.

Early on there had been plans to make this game free to play after release. These plans have been revoked. In my opinion that is no problem at all. People who bought the game early on in early access, had the moonstone bonus and could play the game. The value has been increased if you evaluate that now you've always to pay full retail pricing. 

Now there are also payed DLC/Expansion content released additional to free content Updates. The development of this game is great and they're adding good content way faster than I would've guessed in the beginning. Therefore in my opinion it is absolutely justified to make the game a fully retail payed game with additional content added in expansion passes. This makes sure we get this high quality game it currently is and can be sure it will get the same love and many updates as before.

There has been lots and lots of content added through the early access phase. Seven Updates so far.  The Quality overall is great and the characters are well done. Pricing in the ingame Shop is now more moderate than in the beginning. For example a housing skin, costs you 3750 Moonstone that's around 12-14 bucks, you can use the house also as additional personal home with customization and storage options. You can have altogether more than 6 homes, currently with more housing skins/options possibly added in the future.

The Games has starpaths available they cost around 8$ and give you optional cosmetic items.

This game is fully playable with die 30$ version, ore the gold edition including the expansion and giving you lots and lots of hours of great gameplay. You only have to spend money optional. That makes this game no more or less costly than other titles on the market.

Since buying this game I’ve been taken down an emotional rollercoaster of cherished memories of my Disney-filled childhood. It’s offered me a heartwarming experience with the freedom to create a self-insert from my adolescent years with the freedom to change up said avatar at any point with no gender-locking on cosmetics. I can be who I want to be and interact with my favourite characters.
It’s a game filled with nostalgia and potential, but it falls short in a few key areas.
The graphics are great, and there's an array of furniture to decorate with.

However, the gameplay feels grindy and lacks interactivity, making it less engaging compared to similar titles it’s often compared to, like Animal Crossing.

As an early access title, I was prepared and 100% understood that part of the reason making DDVL early access was for the developers collect feedback from the player base and fix bugs/glitches.
I have accepted that there will be bugs but have been fortunate enough to find workarounds provided by the game’s active Discord community or squished efficiently by the developers in a reasonable amount of time. This does not concern me.

My major problem with the game and my reason that I cannot recommend it at this current time lies with the developer’s monetisation strategy.

Despite being in early access, it already features a premium shop with overpriced cosmetic items. The fear of missing out on time-limited purchases contradicts the game's welcoming nature.

I was begrudgingly willing to accept the premium shop as a necessary evil, as the game was advertised to eventually be “free-to-play”.

I understand making the game F2P beyond early access and providing further free updates requires time and money to make these a reality.

I’m personally fine with DDVL being a paid product! I’m even happy to fork out for expansions and “stuff packs” (IE Wall-E and Ursula cosmetic packs) as long as things aren’t tied behind a time limit to pressure the players into spending their money ASAP. 

But with the recent announcement that the game will remain a paid product to “ensure quality” and the introduction of an expansion(s?), I feel that the premium shop should be reconsidered; 
The developers should either stick with a paid model and get rid of the premium shop & starpaths or go fully free-to-play with strictly cosmetic microtransactions, without locking future characters behind a paywall.

As it stands, the intentions of the developers feel incredibly greedy and their current plans make DDVL feel like a money-grabbing mobile game pretending to be something more.

I'll edit my review depending how Gameloft moves forward from the community's criticism but in its current state, I sadly do not feel as though I can recommend it. =(",1698589171,1698788064,False,14,0,0.575109362602233887,0,True,False,True

I don't mind that this will be a paid game, but you can't have it both ways. There is no reason a paid game should push microtransactions for premium/cosmetic DLC while also locking new characters and storyline content behind paywalls and expansion passes. This is a cute, fun, family-friendly game, but the devs are obviously just taking advantage of kids and people who have already sunk too much time and money into the game to quit at this point. I'm just glad I dropped it after running out of quests a few months ago.

Obviously oriented toward kids, but there's some impressive depth and an engaging story! The gameplay is fun and mostly smooth, and anyone who likes farming, collecting, and questing will enjoy it. Five hours in, I still feel like I'm in the beginning of the game.

I've played this game since launch day 1 of early access, originally on switch (Don't!, it's laggy, glitches and crashes almost hourly for me and has less item capacity so you cannot decorate your valley as much as PC) I've clocked over 120 hours on both switch and PC and PC is far superior with better visual qualities, it runs quicker and has a larger item capacity than switch. It does occasionally crash but this is way less than switch plus it's still being developed and changed.

The addition of the premium shop has really soured the experience for me. The prices are outrageously HIGH, especially for a skin. It also preys on your fear of missing out by including a timer for the premium shop reset when new products will arrive. So far only a handful (if that) have made a reappearance in the premium shop. There is no catalogue, some items have been causing peoples games to crash and fail to reload when purchased items have been placed, clipping issues to name a few.

Alongside this there have also been two character story packs that are to be purchased with premium currency with some new quests relating to that character and new clothing/furniture items as rewards. These are also quite highly priced.

With the newest addition of weekly Dreamsnaps challenges the premium currency has become part of the reward for participating. It has helped many of us to purchase at least some of the premium shop items without spending hard cash. Dreamsnaps rewards us playing the game and voting on previous entries. It has allowed us to be more creative with our valley and encourages community involvement, overall an enjoyable and welcomed feature. 

Originally we were told this game would go free to play but it seems to have been redacted recently. Alongside this Gameloft have also announced an expansion DLC that's almost as expensive ($29.99) as the standard edition base game ($39.99) with what we know so far as only including 2 or 3 new characters.

Having purchased the game twice after discovering the switch version is rubbish and practically unplayable for me I'm reluctant to spend even more on this game when it's starting to feel like nothing but a cash grab. I will eventually get the expansion when it goes on offer but I certainly will not be paying full price.

Once the character quests are done there isn't much to do except, plant and harvest crops, mine for gems and fish. It gets stagnant quite quickly. We need more mini games and things to keep us entertained, like animal crossing has balloons that float by, bugs to catch, the ability to make snowmen, people and sellers stopping by, snorkelling, visiting other islands etc. It would also be great if we had a re-sell option to sell back the multiple furniture items we don't need.

I have mostly stopped playing but have been coming back for around 2-3 hours a week at most to participate in most Dreamsnaps and to complete the star-paths.",1698750508,1698750857,False,9,0,0.558232903480529785,0,True,False,True

€99 for the deluxe, aggressive monetisation. Promises of free to play at release. Now we have a €29,99 ""expansion pack"". DISNEY wants 1. expensive games 2. games with microtransactions. 3. PAID DLC on top of all of this. I'm not a fool. I got my 288 hours out of this. Money well spent? Yes, until the latest news. Now it's a firm NO. Don't waste your time.

--------
I like the game itself, but for how much the game costs (almost €100 for the most expensive edition) there is a CASH SHOP. With a house skin that costs almost €15 in premium currency. That alone is worth a thumbs down. Fuck off with the greed.

Edit: And now there's a new house skin for a little bit under €15. I'm going to keep calling these bitches out because this shit ruined Animal Crossing Pocket Camp, too.

It is still a fun game that is still receiving updates, the game is around 8-8.5/10. This game on release was horrible but the developers are quick when it comes to fixing bugs or QoL changes so I have to give them props for making such fast and effective updates.

Good:

The design of the game is as you would probably see in every other Disney game, very cartoonish and beautiful. There are many lands that have a sort of emotion when it comes to seeing them, lands start off as gloomy that you need to fix and when you fix them turn into a beautiful landscape of colors.

Characters in this game always feel like they are alive and talking to you as you walk by and always have something to say, they will also watch you fish and cheer you on after you finish catching one and the game makes sure you always have someone cheering you on, also there are licensed disney characters which is always a plus.

Except for NPC housing, everywhere in this land is customizable, so making your imagination run wild is a fun way to pass the time in the game. There is a large variety of furniture you can use that you can buy from the shop, craft yourself or unlocked by doing quests in the game, you can go into the furniture shop and buy any unlocked items so there isn't a limit of one either.

Clothing is very interesting in this game, sure you can use the unlocked clothing to wear which is disney merch basically. But there are decals you can unlock to make your own shirt, hat, etc and design it with whatever 50 decals you want and make an (I think) infinite amount of clothing items.

Decent:

Bugs in this game rarely happen but when they do, they either break your game or crash, one bug in particular will happen randomly, basically doing an interaction with anything has a small chance of softlocking you and it has been in the game since release, I thought it was fixed this patch but it happened again.

Leveling up characters give you certain rewards, clothing, furniture, etc. and it is fun to see which quests get unlocked as well. The problem is when you actually do level them, you have to put so much time and effort into getting them max level and extremely repetitive if you want to level them efficiently.

There are a lot of skills in this game which makes it shine, but some of those skills require you to farm all the time and have around a long cooldown or respawn time, such as mining and fishing.

Bad:

This game has a lot of customization but at the cost of some items being gem only, sure you can farm 50 gems every day or 50 a week as well, but it gets very tiresome. This game wants you to spend money, each item/set costs around 1-3k just for cosmetics that no one can currently see anyway. Certain special character skins can be unlocked for that same amount but they also give quests that come with those costumes, so you are essentially just paying around $12 (calculated by best price gems) to get 2 hour content.

Gathering materials such as flowers and branches is extremely annoying as you have to wait a VERY LONG TIME for them to spawn and you need around 5-20 flowers (15-45 minutes) or 25 branches for a chest (Probably an hour).",1698642694,1698696946,True,2,1,0.529259860515594482,0,True,False,True

But I excuse it since the game was going to be F2P after EA. I bought the game knowing that, while in EA, it would be riddled with bugs. I was locked out of quests and couldn't complete star path duties. At least my FOMO is gone because once you miss out on star path items there's no other way to get them. And you're forever taunted in the collection tab whenever you look at your clothing and furniture sets.

Then recently the devs announced they made the decision to not transition DDLV to a F2P when it officially launches come this Dec. However the game is set up as a F2P game. New house skins and tool recolors 3750 moonstones. New character quests and skins for 4k moonstones each. (for reference: 2500 moonstone for $9.99 and 5500 moonstones for $19.99), And when the game launches there will be an expansion pass for $29.99 with what appears to be characters like Rapunzel and Eve from Wall-E locked behind this paywall. They're even increasing the base game from 29.99 to 39.99. 
Now I know some people will defend the moonstone prices because you can earn them through daily logging in and the higher your rank in Dreamsnaps is. For almost two weeks now the blue chests for the daily login have not spawned for me and I see the same photos in the Dreamsnap for voting. I've voted for someone only to see their dreamsnap reappear 6 additional times. I even had someone's Dreamsnap appeared next to their own Dreamsnap before. The voting system is so poorly done and unfair. 

Having said all that I do enjoy DDLV. It's buggy and there isn't much to do other than decorate your valley.

The fact that people are defending the prices so much is insane and they know nothing about what work actually goes into a game like this. This game has made a ridiculous amount of money before it's even left early access. This game is a story book with minimal (broken) AI & crafting with decorating, it doesn't require an MMO's amount of revenue to keep the lights on! Yes paid DLC is obviously fine but within reason!
As for moonstones, you can't use the argument with dreamsnaps, so many people place dead last because of whatever type of algorithm this game has for it. I've personally won good moonstones from it but not everyone can be so lucky, especially when in voting you will see the SAME submission 3+ times while trying to get your voting rewards. This isn't fair for most players, some people have never won more than the participation reward since the update because of this system.

Moonstones used to be given out in a better way but then they changed the amounts because they wanted to adapt the game to a free to play model. Which if it was, then fine but it's not and with how things are going, I think it's safe to say they probably won't be re-balancing the moonstones.
If they fix this whole mess & fix bugs that were in the game since launch, I'd be more than happy to edit my review but as of now this is super scummy behaviour what with new moonstone items taking priority over bugs.

The amount of broken promises after people have blown so much money and waited so long for F2P is just so disappointing. I wouldn't recommend buying this on steam unless it's actually on a decent sale, you can get it for free with xbox game pass like my bf did lmao

It sounds great until you see the purchasable in-game options and you hear that small voice in the back of your head shouting ""I told you so!"".
Not only is the early access pretty expansive for a game that is said to be F2P after full release, the premium shop and several DLCs has been prioritized and implemented long before we even could talk about a full release.
The two DLCs currently available are relatively short for their prizes and unless you like being sent around to find random characters it doesn't bring much new to the table.

In my opinion, the characters that came to the valey last, like Vanellope and Belle look rather plastic and lack the fine tuned design the early characters have gotten.

This game is designed to be a slipery slope into buying it all, and thinking back from when I started, the omnipresent purchase options have ruined the fun for me. What used to be a ""I wonder what happens"" has become a ""I wonder how much free content there is left"".

If you love Disney, sure give it a try.
If you can't rest until you have collected everything there is and done everything you could, then you either need to be prepared to spnd a lot of money or find another game that doesn't charge you three times its full price to get close to 100%. (Plus, with some star paths already finished and limited items gone, there is o way 100% will be done purchasing the game now).",1698615666,1698615666,False,11,0,0.524343371391296387,0,True,False,True

But given the recent updates from Gameloft, I feel like I have no choice but to voice my disappointment in their decisions moving forward. I purchased DLV day one at the original price point of $30, and ended up loving it so much that I purchased it on my Switch as well in order to take advantage of crossplay. The game's come incredibly far since the early days in terms of bugs and content, but there have been a lot of red flags along the way from development.

The addition of moonstone microtransactions was concerning, to say the least; we'd already paid for the game, was it necessary to add microtransactions before the game had even launched? Many voiced their concerns at that point, but nothing was really done about the egregious price points, aside from the promise of ""earning more moonstones during events and receiving a daily allotted amount."" They also introduced ""Dream Snaps,"" which added an additional level of community engagement and another method to win moonstones, but considering it's entirely based on community voting, it's hardly a viable option. 

Thankfully, we were given the reassurance that the game would be made F2P once the full version dropped, so the moonstone issue was still concerning, but at least it came with the knowledge that they were likely to accommodate the influx of F2P players. Then, of course, we get the announcement of the full release date, a new expansion pass, and their retraction of the F2P promise.

On a personal level, I feel like some part of me should have known that Disney would take this sort of path with their game, but it's still disappointing to see that fear come true. The fact that they are not only not making it F2P, but also INCREASING the price, and making us pay for further expansions? They stated that they'd continue to make ""Free content updates,"" but to what extent? What characters are being kept behind paywalls? What happens to the story if we don't have every villager? The game's become such a blatant cash grab, and it hurts me to say that I'll likely stop playing upon full release. 

If you're still really intent on buying the game, I'd at least recommend grabbing it before full release so you get it for cheaper, and don't bother with the fancy editions.

Now? I would not recommend this as many others are doing recently as it looks like the future of Dreamlight valley is full of whales and greed. My first issue was when mirotransactions like currency were added into the game while it was still in early access mind! while there was bugs and the game wasn't even out yet, but I wasn't that mad as it was going to be F2P or so we were told. Turns out the devs walked back on their promise of a F2P game and now instead you will have to pay for the game, on top of that you will have to pay for an expansion pass? AN EXPANSION PASS FOR A GAME LIKE THIS?! on top of that there is also a premium store in the game....

So they expect you to buy the game either base price or a special edition (which there used to be a bug/issue with people receiving their special edition items in game btw, may still be there), pay for an expansion pass of maybe $30, then there is a premium store that refreshes every 7 days were you use there own premium currency of moonstones, that you can buy too!

This is legit becoming a whales game as you can easily spend over 100 on just the base game and the expansion pass, the pass doesn't even seem worth it either as they seemingly just cut out another free updates Disney villain and put him in with another character who's villain is already free! like come on! They are being so crass-less with how greedy they are, you think mickey mouse gets enough golden baths a year with how much money Disney makes, but i guess not.

I have only participated in 3 dream snaps and the first one net me 600 moonstones.

The back flip on going F2P only matters if you wanted to play over multiple devices, until they change the amount of moonstones you could win from dream snaps getting moonstones is as easy as changing your avatars costume or creating another room in your house.

Any extra content locked behind RL currency paywalls is a different matter and depending on the content may be worth it.

There seems to be a calculation in the Disney parks as well as this game, that all they need do is milk the whales and the money will flow.  they'd rather serve wealthy customers charging ridiculous prices in their parks, hotels, restaurants, stores and even in this game than charge fair prices for fair goods and service and serve the masses.

*** my original review ***

What to say...  have not played Stardew Valley nor Animal Crossing.. the two games most referenced in describing this game.

This is charming, non-violent, seems to ""teach"" good values within the game stories.  It is a builder of sorts, a storybook type adventure...  sooo Disney.. the look and feel is like you are inside a Disney/Pixar animated movie.

Not sure on the length of it.  Seems more on the short side unless you intend to completely transform the world (Village) to your liking.. which is mostly / entirely possible.  Then there will be the various resource collecting loops that suits you that will have to be grinded out.  

Hmm.. as for length I based that on after a few days seeing I have met X of 17 characters... but maybe that 17 is ones that have been mentioned in my play through and not a hard ceiling?  I see a lot of closed doors in the castle when I had only opened 3.   Hmmm.. maybe there is much more con tent that I have yet to unlock.

Not sure what there expansion plans are but it looks like the sky is the limit... Disney has sooo much content available.    

So.. if you are a fan of Disney and maybe those other popular games.. then this is a solid recommendation.  The art is there, the Disney music is there..  the Disney voice tracks is there...  well done.",1663614346,1698550610,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I love this game. However, I hate what they're doing with it. This was originally supposed to be a FTP game, and was available to purchase in early access, which was completely fine. Every update has been somewhat bugged or broken, and the content could be finished (mostly) within a few days. Not only are they keeping it as a paid game, but they're keeping all their ridiculously priced micro transactions, and potentially locking characters and areas behind a paywall. it's obvious that this is a game made by Disney, who are notoriously greedy. Let's say you buy the base game with no bonus content, that's about $30, and then you want to buy the new expansion pack. That's $60 you've already sunk into the game, and that's not counting micro transactions that unlock special outfits, items, quests, and a special outfit for both Wall-E and Ursula. or, you could buy the highest tier special edition for $70 and want the expansion, which means you've spent $100 on the game.

I really enjoy this game. It's a mix between Animal Crossing and Disney with fun critters, quests, music, fun characters, some story, and beautiful scenery. It's also fun designing your own clothing and furniture, and choosing what your valley looks like. I love being able to have a friendship and hang out with some of my favorite Disney characters (still waiting for Lilo though lol). Although, with how much money and hours I've sunk into the game, I can't recommend you buy this. The company is being greedy, and throughout the entirety of early access, big updates have constantly broken people's games. Yes, there have been patches to fix some of that, but it hasn't always fixed everything. Unable to complete quests because an item or place is bugged, or simply because you bought something from the premium shop, put it down as a house for yourself, and then it completely locks you out of your game for days. It's no surprise that Disney is being greedy with this game, as they are with all of their products, but this is ridiculous. They may as well be holding up a sign saying ""GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY"".

Sidenote: Another review says that they have screwed over their content creators promoting this game. When they were promoting this, it was said to be an FTP game. Now that they've gone back on their promise, everything those content creators have been saying is untrue. I don't blame the people for that, I blame Gameloft and Disney for not saying something sooner, and especially not to the people who have been promoting their game. Also, Gameloft customer service.

Tl;dr

⛧ DDV has enough content for the entry fee, but at what cost?

⛧ Gameloft has gone back on their word to make DDV F2P, and it's now a paid game. IMO, their business model has been altered in an unhealthy + bad faith manner.

⛧ I only purchased this game as it was eventually going F2P this year.

⛧ I would NOT have purchased it at all had I known they would go back on their word.

⛧ Unless you're a die-hard Disney fan, it's nothing special that you can't find many more trustworthy devs who make better games in the genre just without a fancy franchise.


Disclaimer: My rating is negative because DDV stated they’d have a F2P model upon launch that they’ve since gone back on. The only defining reason I bought this game in EA was its F2P model. I wanted to support the development, and people who otherwise couldn't afford to purchase it early. If I knew that it would not be F2P, I would not have purchased it. At the time, I felt the base game offered more than enough “free” content for DLCs or additional purchase options not to be an issue, which is no longer the case as they’re not going F2P. I won’t be playing this game past getting achievements. It’s ruined the experience for me, and broken trust that wasn’t earned but still given, and I don’t recommend it to any of my friends. I simply cannot trust a company that can go back on its word, especially when it’s so close to the “promised” launch date. Transparency is imperative to gamers, especially on Steam.

The review below isn’t finished at my preferred quality, as I don’t think Gameloft deserves more than the time I’ve already spent on this. So it’ll look like a jot-down of notes, but with all relevant details (just not my signature fancy schmancy polish). My original review below was going to end with a positive rating. I’m only posting it to reflect the state of the game outside of the drama surrounding it. 

----------------------------------
DDV Reminds me of: Mat farming in Rust, Runescape chill, Genshin Impact minus combat, Animal Crossing: New Leaf & Pocket Camp gameplay loop, Torchlight fishing vibes.

Done Well:
In a nutshell: Genshin Impact with no combat.
Many Animal Crossing OG elements.
It activates the pleasure centres of my brain with the tailored nostalgic soundtrack per companion.

Done Poorly:
- Painfully timegated. If you have a job or a life, you won't be able to make certain time slots in this game without changing your system clock. It's a strange mechanic to have in 2023.
- Poor camera movement in general. Obnoxious transition camera movement.
- Causes mild simulation sickness leading to nausea or dizziness that I didn't get used to over time. 
- You bump into everything and get stuck on everything and certain things like trees/rocks have invisible walls etc. It doesn't help with the nausea.
Fix: This is what helped me. Play on smaller Windowed mode. Reduce mouse/controller sensitivity completely in game settings. Reduce mouse sensitivity further through my mouse's software (or PC settings). Remove all the trees and foliage possible in all biomes after you've enjoyed it a bit. 
Even then this game's camera movement is really poorly designed for a AAA third person game. All the clutter in each biome in the game is painful. It looks nice initially but causes eye strain and nausea. Your eyes will spin, and spin and you'll feel sick. Imagine being at a theme park and being there for hours on end, the sensory overstimulation is exactly what it feels to play DDV. 
- EA related: A - Frequent crashes. I had to force close my game more than 5 times just within my first 35 hours. That means for me, every day that I played for about 4-5 hours I would ALWAYS get one or more game freezes where I'd have to force close. I haven't had any substantial issues with my saves at this point, but this many crashes is definitely an issue. B - Desync issues. At times you don't have correct visual indicators, parts of your crops teleport and stay that way. Clearly early access state, but not in a way that gets in the way of enjoyment. C - Buggy item spawns. Nothing game breaking yet, but you will lose things under other objects, get things stuck eternally etc. 
- Needless Movement Momentum: When you run in DDV and change directions abruptly, it slows the character model down in an animation that is annoying and redundant in a non-action genre game. It’s commonly seen in genres like platformers and punish or aid the player to utilise physics in the game and make it look like natural momentum/movement. In an action game it would be understandable as precision movement is the whole point. In a casual farming sim, I don't understand why there is punishment for moving and changing direction fast. My only thought is this is linked to what visually looks the best or makes sense aesthetically. As someone who plays games at a relatively fast pace and am used to a lot of quick, efficient movement regardless of genre, it is confusing that players have to work around this in DDV of all games. It also adds to the myriad of poor design choices the game has made that causes simulation sickness or worsens it.

You start by squealing at the Disney bunnies and squirrels, but realise the best is when you notice two completely random Disney characters having a nice chat on a bench. Sometimes I'll just fast-travel and see a random turtle plod plod swimming away in the far ocean that I have to squint and make out and it's the cutest thing. The random genuine grins and smiles I got playing this game make it worth it. Once I found Wall-E (my fav in DDV) staring out at the ocean and then having a ridonculous chat with Ariel about which human thingamajigs might do what.

DDV is relaxing to play in different ways, whether you 1) reveal new biomes 2) meet new characters/worlds 3) finish Quests or 4) acquire Dreamlight and 5) participate in Events. You can just roam around and enjoy the Disney of it all. Have fun taking photos or screenshots. 

There's a lot you can do, but the UI and gameplay loops make everything easy and clear to understand and stay interested in. I have a very short attention span and get very overwhelmed by details easily. But I've also been gaming for decades so I need something intriguing, fun and addicting. DDV delivers the MMORPG minus MMO that I'd been craving for years. That being said, no MP/co-op is saddening because I would've gotten all my friends on this game if I could've. All that being said, at the 160 hr point I am deathly tired of the game and just want to 100% it and be done.

Overall, this game is incredibly well made. I wanted a chill time waster and I know this will be it for the next +600 hours (Edit at 164 hrs: +600 turned out to be incorrect and I’m now bored). There are too many properly done things in this game from features to sensory immersion that it's hard to list them constructively without simply saying it has everything you need, the accessibility you take for granted, and the happy feel-good world you've been craving. The devs have thought of everything and covered everything. I purchased this at full price standard though I knew it was going to F2P. I rarely do this. (Edit: Hilarious in hindsight as a lot of my enjoyment in DDV heightened by my knowledge of this going F2P.)

- Achievements tip
This game has several ""currencies"" as is usual these days. Dreamlight is one that is used to open up different areas and access characters. There is a Dreamlight menu when you press ""esc."" Whatever mini quests you complete in Dreamlight Duties and anything in that Dreamlight tab is what counts to your Steam achievements counter. Nothing else is counted. So don't worry about achievements, don't proactively do anything, just focus on your Dreamlight Duties as you play naturally. And especially for Dreamlight Duties, collect them immediately so you can get the next one in line available.",1698510756,1698510796,False,33,0,0.771476507186889648,0,True,False,True

It is a glorified mobile game originally sold with lies. And the f2p model is dropped to continue free content updates? Yet, right on launch day, you can buy paid dlc! Oh yeah, I totally see how the excellent free updates are saved. Also a lot of moonstone stuff was a) grossly overpriced, b) mediocre quality and c) required to get the star path items you actually wanted. But no worries! They are keeping it the same! Phew.

I can no longer recommend this game at all. I feel almost scammed. Leaving the original review for posterity, I suppose, to show how hopeful and positive I was at the start if this. This year of EA has done only one thing for me: ruin a promising game and wasted my money.


Original, positive: I am greatly enjoying the game, although I greatly enjoy Disney. You can be a Disney princess or prince, living our childhood dreams. Now I just need to be able to live as Yzma and goals achieved.

I wish I hadn't bought in to the early access, and if I was looking at it now ($40-70 base game, $30 day one DLC, premium currency and shop) I'd pass it by. Obviously they aren't making enough from premium currency sales, or they believe that people will keep paying $30 for new content. Either way, with this being a live service game, at some point they'll decide they've milked it for all it's worth and shut the thing down.

Pricing and business practices aside, the game is fun if you enjoy Disney characters and aesthetics. It's very casual, even more so than Animal Crossing in my opinion. You can choose how your character looks and dresses, you can customize the placement of all the buildings, and you can largely decorate any way you want. If you want to explore all or even most of the content, you must have all of the characters in your valley and be friends with all of them. The villains in particular lock quite a bit of content, and I wish I didn't have to interact with Scar, Ursula, and Mother Gothel. The ""Forgotten"" story is also a bore in my opinion, and I somewhat wish that the game had more attention to mechanics than to trying to write a story. You get ""choices"" in dialogue but they all get to the same place. All of the quests are linear: go here, do this, get that without any decision making. The most frustrating are the quests that require waiting real life days to advance.

I wouldn't recommend this game to any new players unless it is free. I think that the announcement of the new base $40 price (instead of free-to-play as previously stated) is a ploy to get people to purchase before the full release. I wouldn't be at all surprised if after the full release they steeply discount the game, or make it free whenever they announce the next paid expansion.

The initial promise of DDV eventually going F2P after the early-access period has been broken. The game already features a full suite of microtransactions and additional monetization, which was added under the pretense that after the EA period, the game would transition from a Founders programme to a free-to-play model. This is no longer the case.

Gameloft doubled down and are keeping the game's sizeable up-front price tag, as well as the microtransactions and premium currency. Not only that, they are now added a second season pass (on top of the seasonal Star Path system) that costs a ludicrous amount of money and gates off substantive content like quests and new villagers, and also CANNOT be purchased with the premium currency awarded to Founders for their early adoption of the game.

Avoid the mistake I made and don't fall for it. From here on out, the landscape of DDV's business side will only get worse, and within a year or two I wouldn't be surprised to see it looking like a Sims game with hundreds of dollars worth of extra content that was, initially, promised to us all for free.

After this, I grew disinterested in the game very quickly. The game has been plagued with bugs, and the fixes slow to come. On their Discord, Gameloft attempted to channel all complaints regarding the microtransactions to a ""Premium Shop"" thread. For months, people have been complaining about prices, FOMO, and how the items don't feel premium at all. Now, the game will keep its nasty F2P model while not being F2P. They ask people to pay money for the second part of the story, with no options to use the ""premium"" currency that were bought as part of the Founder's pack.

The game tries to provide a way to escape reality, but Gameloft constantly brings us back it with a behavior that is the antithesis of what the game is supposedly about.

Some skins cost $20.00 USD after tax already such as the houses.  This is just ultimate greed and companies like this don't deserve to be supported.  There are better games out there that do the same thing that don't cost an arm and a leg.",1698482983,1698482983,False,60,0,0.682501494884490967,0,True,False,True

It's a very basic, very soothing psuedo-farming sim, with familiar characters. It's good for when I want to do something with my hands and not think very hard. Excellent for listening to podcasts.  I've also spent quite a lot of money on it. The premium Star Path every time, both optional quest packs, tons and tons of moonstones. And I didn't really care about the microtransaction aspect of it, because it genuinely felt like the game was equally enjoyable to people who couldn't spare as much money as I could. And since it was going to be Free to Play on release, I wanted to support the company as much as I possibly could. 

But then the company revealed that, actually, they don't want to make it free. I don't enjoy being lied to by the people I'm regularly giving money. Maybe I'm just petty. 

I don't mind $30 DLC, but when you reveal that you will no longer support free updates outside of the main questline, after all that? I'm out. Sorry, but using the Sims business model isn't a valid decision when there are thousands of games on the market with your exact, very basic gameplay loop. 

I would only recommend this game to people who are interested in paying hand over fist for the glory of the Disney license. If you've been to Disney World multiple times this year despite living more than five hours away from Orlando, you'll probably like this a lot.

However with the newest update I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. As other people have stated they have introduced a ridiculously priced premium shop that has cosmetics that may or may not become available again. 
The newest update has also broken the game. I have experienced so many bugs that I have had to close and open the game to fix and I find myself really disappointed that they focused on introducing a premium shop instead of fixing some of these game breaking bugs. 
I want desperately to love this game but 5 months into early access development feels really early to be introducing a premium shop that is so over priced. Its not a good sign for the direction this game is going. I am not opposed to the premium shop but the unclear status of the items and the exorbitant prices (as others have said being about $55 per week) has not inspired confidence in the future of this game.

EDIT: All my worst fears have been confirmed. They will not be releasing the full edition as F2P as advertised. And will be screwing over the players who paid for the more expensive editions by making us buy the expansion pass even though we have already given them $90. It ridiculous.

I have over 200 hours in this game, got it when it first came out. As the game stands now, I do NOT recommend anyone to get this game. I will say all the positive first then the negative. The graphics, cute and easy on the eyes. Makes me feel like I am in a disney movie, tons of fun playing with the characters. Unlocking quests and doing the story is great. The roadmap they have planned out for the game is amazing. I have spent money on this game for the ""battle pass."" !!!!!HEAVY SPOILER WARNING AFTER THIS!!!!!!

Now the not so great stuff...
Bugs, omg the bugs. Full range of issues, the bugs only seem to get worse with each update. I played not even 30 minutes, I had to force close the game 3 times. It got stuck on certain screens and I couldn't do anything. Sometimes if you click on a different tab, or on a different screen. It will fix this issues and force it to reload. However this didn't work, I was stuck on the screen and had to force close it. Then boot up the game again. Right now there is one bug that is very annoying, if it wasn't for me needing to finish the battle pass I wouldn't be playing right now. Scrooge has a shop, this shop is suppose to refresh everyday with new items. My shop has been glitched for over a week, it will not refresh, I can not buy any of the items in the store. I verified the files in my game and that didn't work. I am scared to uninstall and install it again, in fear I will lose progress. The steam cloud for this game is glitchy according to other players. The devs refuse to address this issue, a lot of players (including myself) have reported this issue. I also have this weird bug, where the flowers in the frozen heights are all red, but when I pick them up, it gives me the color they are suppose to be...

The devs...I swear they love to traumatize us.
The battle pass has some annoying quests, that you HAVE TO PREPARE FOR WEEKS IN ADVANCE TO GET DONE! You have to gather a ton of flowers, and keep gathering them in ALL THE AREAS. (Gotta catch them all, expect gather all the flowers instead.) I am hardstuck on finishing the battle pass because I don't have 20 flowers.... Don't get me started on some of the quests they did. Who thought it was a good idea, to make us gather 200 CLAY FOR ONE QUEST?!?! Then the devs were like...let's make Minnie remind you of your trauma. AHAHAHA, screw you devs -.-

I fully understand this game is meant to have a little grind, but the 200 clay...the flowers you have to mass horde in fear you need them for the next battle pass. Is annoying! Clay you can get in a few of the areas, you either have to dig at the ground and hope for the best, or go mine the bones in the other area to get some. You need a lot of clay for the quests, like the Minnie mouse one. All for a clock tower you do nothing with, you just place it and boom done.... You don't know in advance what flowers you need, so you have to collect flowers from all the areas. Find room to horde them in, then hope you have enough when the battle pass comes out, or you are stuck like me. Having to boot up the game, hoping it will not bug out, and collect the flowers. (I do this a few times a day, for those who work. This is very annoying)

Today was the worse for me having issues with this game, the bugs are so bad. It is unplayable, just quickly teleporting to an area. Will cause you have to force close your game. Did you try to leave a house or area going through a door, sorry you have to alt tab out or force close the game. Wait did you try to put an outfit on a character but you did it to quickly, nah you gotta force close your game buddy. Wait wait wait, did you claim a reward in the battle pass, that you worked your butt off to finish, but you did it to quickly. GUESS WHAT, TIME TO FORCE CLOSE THE GAME!!!!

I made this review in anger and defeat, but as you can somewhat tell.....just stay away. I will update the review IF it gets better. They are hinting at a new update, hopefully it fixes some issues. The devs are ignoring some game breaking bugs, like I talked about in this review. At the time of making this review, they have not acknowledged the Scrooge Shop bug. 

As of 5/31/23 these bugs are still happening, I sent a report to the devs. Got told it was my fault for ""time skipping,"" I don't time skip. Unless this happened cause of daylight savings time, that is the only way I can think of. They have put the buzz alien bug and scrooge bug into issues they are aware of. No idea when this will be fixed.

8/14/23 - I can not buy the full outfits in scrooge shop, alien bug seems to be fixed. They are aware of the issues about the shop, still have not fixed them. A lot of the bugs I reported have been fixed, or happens not as often now. The wall-e bundle still has bugs where he gets stuck. This is an issue they know about, it's been bugged since they put out the bundle. Earning moonstones to get the ""battle pass,"" is easier to get. They have put stuff into the game to earn them. I think you can earn around 200 a day.

10/27/23 - They took back the free to play they promised, they also are asking us to pay $30 for an expansion pass for more content. The game still has the scrooge shop bug, that I have had for months. The quick teleport bug is still happening as well. If I go to the map, then go to teleport or exit the teleport selection to quickly. It still glitches with the teleport menu up. I can't move or click out of it, only way to fix it. Is to force close the game.",1683514402,1698465781,False,4,1,0.540949404239654541,0,True,False,True

I think I've seen go as high as 14,000. This system is great but the submissions are broken currently, and people have been seeing submissions from past challenges when voting and it's been affecting players rankings poorly because they aren't getting seen like they should be. Hopefully this will get fixed, but if it doesn't, what I'm about to say may probably explain why it hasn't or won't get fixed.

This game was created with the intention of going F2P. They introduced the Premium Shop WAY too soon for an Early Access product, and quite frankly no Early Access product should have one for the obvious reasons.

They canceled Free-To-Play entirely. It's going to stay paid to play. Their lack of transparency around F2P just tells me they knew it was going to be free to play to begin with. Is there proof of that? Idk, but if you look at how badly they word about when we would get the premium shop, or how they word things in general, AND THE OBVIOUS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY when it comes to how DLCs will work, it makes them look like they purposefully deceived us just so they could add F2P monetization mechanics to A PAID TO PLAY GAME. 

Why ARE WE PAYING to play Act II WHEN WE ALREADY PAID FOR THE GAME. WHY ARE THEY TREATING THIS GAME LIKE IT'S FREE TO PLAY WHEN IT'S NOT FREE TO PLAY ANYMORE?!?!!? STOP FALLING FOR THIS. DON'T LET THEM GASLIGHT YOU INTO THINKING THIS IS A GOOD BUSINESS MOVE BECAUSE IT IS WRONG ON SO MANY LEVELS.

This game is screwed and they know it. The influx of F2P players would have negative review bombed them because their players aren't dumb. Especially the ones that don't have money to literally throw away.

This game will become just like the Sims 4. The community will slowly become just as toxic as the Sims 4 community. And depending on the YouTuber, this game will get Dreamlight-Gurus where they just keep gaslighting and manipulating the community into think this game is good and you should throw your money away.

Don't buy this game if you have impulse issues. Don't buy this game if FOMO effects you or you're a person that likes to collect EVERYTHING in video games. 

The only thing that will potentially save this game is if they allow people to buy expansions/characters/DLC with moonstones. It would better justify the reason in having a premium currency to begin with. But if they don't, I'm done, I quit. And many others will too.

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing this game from time to time, but if this game is paid to play now, I shouldn't HAVE to throw away ANOTHER 30$ that I don't even HAVE to keep following the main story quest. A paid game means that ALL ACTS should be inside said price we already paid for. The 30$ I already spent for the GAME ITSELF now, thanks to Gameloft being stupid, was already a waste as is. This game isn't advertised as an episodic game like Life Is Strange. Don't treat it like one.

I don't CARE if Disney's name is on it. Walter himself wouldn't of approved of this monetization model if he lived long enough to see this game being created. He didn't WANT it to be too expensive for people to get into the actual disney parks. Now people have to be PAYWALLED in order to CONTINUE the STORY of Disney Dreamlight Valley? Walter would have been LIVID.

ok, now for the reason for not recommending this game.

for players that have caught up with everything, there's hardly anything new and when there is new content -- ie a new character, a few new quests, it's not enough content to keep the player engaged long-term. once you've finished either decorating your island or exhausting the amount of items you can place aka reaching your limit, there's... pretty much nothing to do. hope the RNG gods are nice to make scoorge's shop not have junk you already own or don't want in it one day without resetting? become an pack-rat and hog all the materials you may or may not use? hear the characters say the same dialogue over and over again? wait for 'star-paths' and hope you have enough in-game pay-to-win currency to be able to unlock all the exclusives?


for a slice-of-life game genre like this, that's not too out of the ordinary, but the reason why i'm stating the following is because this is not an ordinary casual game that fans of the genre would gravitate to. the reason why is because of the absurd amount of micro-transactions this game has. it has took the community of  EA  players to complain about the 'in-game' currency has hardly any drop rates to get it 'free to play' (while the game was advertised as being released as free to play) and showing greed. the items in the moonstone (in-game currency) store are items that if you were to pay real money for, are way too expensive to make it a worthwhile investment. also, as mentioned previously, the 'star paths' have exclusive items locked unless you spend either real currency or hope you have the moonstones needed to unlock the rest.

let's not get started that character skins are now behind the paywall.

now, that wouldn't be TOO bad if the game was released as free-to-play as originally advertised, but since the recent announcement that this game is no longer free to play, what is the use of pay-to-win mechanics in a game we have to pay for, including DLC? there's way better games in this genre that do not require both micro-transactions or DLC to purchase. it's a direct slap on the face for your fanbase that has stayed behind despite the micro-transactions because they love both the idea of the game and hoped with their input the full release would be something they'd love to share with friends.



i cannot in good conscience recommend this game for anyone to pick up. the devs have not been fully honest with their fanbase and lord knows how much more 'pay-to-win' currency will be implemented post-launch despite not being a free to play game. talk about corporate greed at its finest. it's a shame since i actually enjoy going back to this game for the slow-paced relaxed atmosphere it provides.",1698438528,1698438676,False,14,0,0.537503361701965332,0,True,False,True

Update: cross platform cloud save DOES NOT WORK. I cannot log into my account on another device or platform even when I log out on steam. Apparently this has been an issue since EA launch.

PATCH THE GD GAME BREAKING BUGS! Waiting for weeks to include them in a content patch is ridiculous for a game on Steam. 

Original Review: Plays at 60fps on Steam Deck and looks fantastic on medium settings, though I ran into a few bugs and weird issues that caused me to hard close the game. Luckily it autosaves about every 5 minutes and you can manually save whenever you want.

You have to use a physical keyboard to put in your name at the beginning because it doesn't register the virtual keyboard. The game plays in real time like Animal Crossing but everything doesn't shut down at night and the city stays lively. Energy is like Stardew Valley where you can refill it with food you harvest and cook, but you can also restore it by just going home. Cooking and gardening has more value here unlike ACNH which is just tacked on. 

The gameplay is no more basic than a Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing game, but the quests add something extra and help the game feel like a light adventure game as well. It's arguably better than the recent harvest moon games and no breakable tools like the most recent ACNH. 

There appears to be no time gating, you unlock things with gameplay. For example, you don’t have to wait for your house to upgrade once you’ve paid for it. You can play the game every day for as long as you want. There is far more to do and a much bigger world than Animal Crossing.

The visuals are nice, it really gives that Disney fantasy feel with it's bright colours and really makes your character fit in.
So far I'm enjoying the game, but dear lord Satan does the male running posture annoy me, it's sticking your chest our while arching your lower back out to make it seem like your have an dump truck ass. Also the character sometimes edges to the left on it's own, which is hella annoying when you're digging.

As you know this game is going to be free to play at full release, so buying this isn't necessary unless you really want to play it that badly and have access to exclusive items. But if you do plan on buying it, you really really need to consider carefully which version.
As I've learnt the hard way, you will end up having to pay more to upgrade your bundle i.e. Deluxe Edition £40.63 but if you buy the Standard it's £23.79 then later if you want to upgrade to Deluxe that will cost you £25.88, totalling £49.67.
That's some fuckery right there.

UPDATE: After reading today's news update for this game, I'm going to have to shift my opinion of this game into negative. I remember when they said that they were going to make this game free to play, now while I have no issues with the game being paid for, in the hopes of it actually getting better content and quality updates, I do however have an issue with the lack of content in the base game as it is that hardly warrants a price tag and still wants to charge you for microtransactions.
So they plan to charge you $39.99 for the base game edition and an additional $29.99 for an expansion pass, which makes me wonder how many of the 28 worlds they are going to block off until you fork over the money and mind you, these worlds you visit are a super small part of the game that you're not even going to visit again unless you absolutely have to, because they literally offer zero replay value.
Sure, it's a fun and relaxing game, but the content itself gets pretty boring fast, most the quests you receive from the your villagers are pretty much fetch quests, have to go from A to B, craft item A then B, talk to villager A then villager B or find said item and collect X amount of it. I still feel that the terrain is still very limited and even more so with the villager interactions once you've maxed out your friendship with them and finish their final quest.
The shop, although it my seem that it offers a lot of items, repeats itself too much to find anything new and the order in system is pretty much useless, it can only order in items you already own.
All the fancy items in this game is locked behind the Moonstone shop, which you can actually earn in game by opening chests and voting for other players photos weekly, and in the typical free mobile game fashion, takes forever to earn.
I also can't help but feel that they aren't making the best of Disney's IPs in this game. They literally had a good opportunity to add Nightmare before Christmas for this Halloween update but instead added Beauty and the Beast.

So do I recommend this game? ONLY when it's at a decent discount, do not buy this game at full price.
Also I wouldn't bother with the Gold edition of this game, the exclusive items are super weak for what they want to charge you.",1662983787,1698435104,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was more than happy to pay a base price to get the game in early access. But the fact they just announced today that they won't be making this free to play makes me have to change my review for the reasons below. 

I have noticed in some of the more recent updates that extra quests are blocked by a pay wall. If it was free to play, I would understand. But it is not and that doesn't sit right with me.
NOW they are also making you pay $30 for the expansion.......when the price of the game depending on your edition is $40 for the base or $70 for the Gold edition. It's just greedy!!!!!!!! Either make us pay one big price at time of purchase and have us spend SS on cosmetics or make it free to play and we buy expansions. But these quests being blocked by a paywall and now purchasing expansion packs for quests on top of already dishing out $40 - $70 for the game itself is just disgusting. 





This game is a beautiful, fun, cozy game for Disney fans. I love having all the classic Disney songs playing in the background, adding to the atmosphere. This game is still early access and some of the quests kind be a little grindy, but overall I have thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like Animal Crossing and are a Disney fan, I highly recommend.

Only a couple negatives that hopefully will be fixed as the game gets released:
1) When you first get your house, you are left with a bunch of old furniture. You can remove it but it's then forever stuck in your inventory (thank goodness not inventory that takes up pocket or chest space)

2) YOU MUST DO THE QUEST IN ORDER: There have been a couple quest where I had to make something. I happened to already have those ingredients, made the item and it didn't count because I didn't ""collect"" the ingredients. This left me with duplicates of some quest items that you cannot sell.

With these 2 problems, I really really really really really really hope that in the future we can sell old furniture or extra quest items. Or at least delete them since the quest items do take up space and you have to store them in a chest. 

Otherwise, I really have been enjoying this game. WALLE is so adorable! I can't wait for Stitch to join.",1664737679,1698425420,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

While this price isn't bad, it having micro transactions for items and clothes you can't otherwise get still along with a season pass makes it annoying at least. It's either a free-to-play game they're charging 30 dollars for, or a 30 dollar game they also put micro transactions in.

I bought this game in early access while I had Covid and couldn't do much else and stuck with it for a while. I even had a glitch that got me stuck in the story so I couldn't continue. When I told Gameloft, they had a very generic response just explaining how to do the quest. I told them they didn't help and waited months for another response.

Overall, I can't recommend this game because any game that you have to pay for to play that also has micro transactions just feels like double dipping to me.

And now with the devs announcing the f2p promise is being walked back, where is the justification for their pricing?

As if the f2p walk-back wasn't bad enough, we're also being told that characters will be locked behind a paywall now? The recent expansion announcement shows Rapunzel and Gaston... are we expected to pay $30 for two characters? Will ALL future characters be locked away for a high price point? Or will it only be the popular ones, in an attempt to squeeze even more money from those of us who were loyal fans? 

Base game is $30. It'll be $60 for the base game + expansion... on a game that was said to be f2p on release during the first year of their early access. Deluxe edition is like $60 when not on sale, so with the expansion that'll be up to $90. You are quite literally punishing people who bought the higher editions in an attempt to support the game and the devs in the early day. 

Disney being money hungry is nothing new, but come on. At least be a bit better at hiding it. The expansion and the store price points could be brushed away with the promise of f2p on full release, but that's no longer a thing. So, what's the new excuse? 

RIP to this game. I was really looking forward to it, but I'm done.

EDITING TO ADD: They also really fucked creators over. Content creators, streamers, youtubers, etc advertised the game to their followers as a future f2p game... They were under the impression that it would be. The devs never corrected or updated this so that creators could lets their audience know. It's a completely bad faith move. 

Also looking back, the last time DDLV twitter commented about free-to-play was back on Jan 6th 2023. This is after tweeting about f2p multiple times a year throughout 2022. So, just how early into 2023 did you guys know? Because sitting here, it looks like they knew they'd no longer be doing f2p for at LEAST 8 months given the fact that they stopped advertising it as such.

I am having some issues with the furniture placement mode, but I think it's more about my individual set-up than the game. Otherwise it runs very well.

I am concerned about future monetization. Right now there's enough in the game to keep me happy, and I've only spent Moonstones that I got in the founder's package and have not bought more. We'll see how that advances.

So i was really quite interested in this and went all-out and bought the ultimate edition. 
THAT TURNED TO BE A MASSIVE MISTAKE.

So it turns out the game only lets you redeem this content once and coupled with bugs that is recipe for disaster: I got to the stage in the game where i could (try) claim the content from my mailbox. I saw the ultimate edition content in there (along with the first week stuff ect). went to try claim it and was met with the error 'an unexpected error occurred please try again later'. I thought maybe just servers are busy?. 
Restarted the game loaded my save then i had a duped mailbox two (a known bug which is said to just be a graphical issue). Went to try claim my items and this time i could claim (one set of the 'duped' items).

However where it all went really wrong, was the ultimate edition stuff did not duplicate in the same way as the rest, but instead it's claimable 'dupe' was just the basic pack; leaving the ultimate edition content with the error in my mailbox. 
So pretty much i paid for that content and NEVER GOT IT nor appear to ever be able of getting it. 

Just a big worry is it seems, is you can only ever claim that content once for one save game you ever have (so if you loose your save game you loose that real world extra money you spent and all that content).
Obviously i then didn't want to risk attempting to play anymore and cant play anymore until i (hopefully) get this fixed so really can't comment on the actual game-play, because i couldn't even get that far.

So my advice is DO NOT BUY ANY OF THE EXTRA CONTENT (at least at this stage). It is far too risky for that much cost to have it limited to your one save game and be at high risk of losing (as i have) due to bugs.

I have got in contact with Gameloft support and will change my review once/if this is fixed. Completely not fair if i completely loose that content which i paid twice the base price of the game for over this dumb bug. In general anyone who buys that content should have the content available for all their saves (not just one save game). That is beyond a money ripping joke if it is really this case and i advise anyone to stay clear of any purchasable content if it stays this way. 

New Post [Positive]
A good while since the intial release the Devs have overcome many of the initial bugs and got my content back. I did have to restart my save in the end-But still got my content. 

Came back to this game recently and was impressed with the progress and enjoyed playing it. My only gripe being it's quite 'grindy' at times, which i know some may hate, but i can enjoy this in a game as i can just shut off and fish/mine ect.

I do enjoy this game, and it's great if you have small kids (my 4 year old enjoys to watch me play).

The prices as written in the shop are still pretty ridiculous; that hasn't changed. However, with the premium currency rewards from the weekly Dreamsnaps challenge, you're never going to be paying full price out of pocket. It rewards playing the game and creativity and encourages community involvement, and is overall a truly fantastic feature. I stopped playing for a while, and coming back and participating in Dreamsnaps every week has genuinely been a very fun experience. 

I won't say all of my issues with the game are fixed now - the FOMO aspect of the shop is still really awful - but this is a HUGE improvement, and I think it's worth calling the game a positive experience overall. It seems only fair to update my review to reflect that.

-----
I held out on giving a negative review because I wanted to see if the devs made changes based on community feedback, but this recent update (the Lion King realm update) has made it clear they have no intention of doing so.

Before the addition of the premium shop, my review would have been positive, with a few caveats about game balance (particularly the scarcity of iron as a resource and the absurdly high material requirements for crafting, which make the game very grindy), and of course bugs and glitches, which are to be expected in early access and are mostly being ironed out. Prior to the addition of the premium shop, I felt the devs were, for the most part, doing a pretty good job of applying feedback and fixing the issues with the game, and that it was going in the right direction to be a truly incredible game. I have put hundreds of hours into DLV between Switch and PC because I do love playing it.

However, the addition of the premium shop has done so much to destroy the good will I had toward this game and completely soured the experience for me. I was actually looking forward to the addition of a shop and being able to purchase more items for decoration and support the development of the game - this was actually something I had been really excited to in comparison to a game like Animal Crossing, which got stale without new content. I want to support the development of games I enjoy by paying for content to support the creation of more content I enjoy. The battle pass is a great example of monetization, so I had faith the shop, when it was introduced, would be similarly well done. 

It wasn't. The prices are absolutely outrageous for the quantity and quality of what's being offered. It's so bad that I honestly feel scammed out of the moonstones I already purchased from buying the game on two platforms (ultimate on switch, standard on PC) because the value and purchasing power of those moonstones has ended up being so low, and they buy so little.

The shop is set up to be incredibly predatory, with disgusting FOMO tactics about items that ""might"" return and limited edition items without telling us the items are limited, for how long, what will ve available when, when they will come back, etc. There is no catalogue, there is no way of previewing items in game before purchase, and many of the items have had issues about being not as advertised, different colors, poor quality clipping issues, etc. Many of the items are not anything I would consider premium quality, tiny bundles split up into multiple item packs, so for example if you want a complete kitchen set, you have to buy three separate item bundles at inflated prices that MIGHT come back. Maybe. You have no way of knowing. So if you want the complete set, you'd better buy every part of that set as soon as you see it, without knowing how many there will be in total or when they'll be available. It's truly awful.

The dev team made an announcement about listening carefully to feedback, and mentioned premium shop changes in the patch notes, but nothing has changed in the newest update. The prices are still outrageously high, there's no catalogue system or way to preview items, there's no communication about what will be available and when. They didn't listen to any of the fantastic suggestions and feedback they received from the community in the official Discord server and it's clear they aren't interested in doing so. 

This is predatory monetization, and I don't support that. 

Until this sham of a premium shop is fixed, my review will remain negative and not recommended. Which is a shame, because it's otherwise a great game.",1680718738,1697637763,True,0,0,0.920349717140197754,0,True,False,True

Complex yet straight forward game with many quests and items. Lots of customization outside of the paid options, and if you save the currency they give you immediately along with doing the event duties, you have enough to get the event passes that you may want in the future.

Cons:

It's basically fetch quest, and that's all.  

I thought it was gonna be a relaxing game but the energy is always impeding that somehow.  In many ways there is no reason to have that except to force you to eat or run back to the house.

You can't jump, I know silly, but most games you can and sometimes people just like to jump for the wimsy of it.  Can be comforting for some.

The only way you can sprint is IF you over eat, and it uses up that annoying energy I warned you about.

It's VERY grindy

The quest aren't easy to understand a lot of the times.

Limited storage per storage box, if it was a connected storage it would just be easy over all.

Some Series/movies they included only has like one character, and it's not even the best ones.  Example: Mother Grothal, fairy god mother

Increasing some stories take special costumes you must pay around $20 worth, and I haven't tested it fully but from the read it may just be for a quest and some items.

I haven't unlocked all the places yet, but feels like it's already getting crowded with the number of homes needing to be placed.

Keys set up is ANNOYING, F opens a menu, which for some games it's used for an action key.  Space is the same as hitting E or right clicking on something, it has no ability to rebind the keys elsewhere either.

Only 29 characters so far, and lacking of traditional princesses.  Instead has people that weren't as huge like Remy.  Only disney princess' being:  Moana, Mirabel, (recent add) Belle, Elsa/Anna, Ariel, Nala?, and Vanellope if you consider her one.

Time is based on YOUR time, and characters go to sleep, so if you're up late and such it's harder to team with some.

Pros:

You can customize clothing and furniture.  Con to this, you can't use them in dream snap so have to remove or change them to submit such.  

See and hang out with some of your beloved characters?

It's beautiful

Great customization features


--------UPDATE--------

Shall I update then?  I have no life, and the game is stuck as one of those log in daily things to check for certain items. (critters, buying from shop, maybe farming daily)  It's like what some people get trapped in the whole, I paid for it I may as well play it some, that doesn't make it worth the cost.  Noted thou, it will be free sooner or later, and the cost is a deal vs the moonstones, so if you plan to buy those, that may make it worth it to you.  

(I also want to know those who go off game time of my game, I have a life in which I leave the comp a lot or leave things running in the background. :P  So my play time isn't always correct in ways.)


As for energy once you get started if you know what to cook and carry certain meals it's not that bad.

Con/Pro:  
You can buy larger lock boxes, but it takes dream points.


Con:  

Critters who show up are random, the con of this is some of them only show up certain times of the day so people who may have a life have a harder time to get.

I find myself wishing I could remove certain characters from the valley but can't.

Holes count as objects placed.

Can only cook one meal at a item, so you just sit there forever doing so.

Flowers around the maps will grow black at times if not picked and will need water. (just an extra waste of energy)

Characters like to stand in your way or crowd around you, luckily you can push them out of the way but it sometimes messes up the random bonus burst you get.



Pro:  

Moana/Beast/Kristoff's booths.  Wallee's Garden.

Dreamsnap events once a week gives you a chance at getting paid currency.

You do get more room, not sure if room will be enough once more characters are added.

Storage are connected in away.  When it comes to crafting etc, so if you have something in a storage random places it can pull from all storage.

The collection menu tells you what critters show that day and the times.  

Crops don't rot and can just sit there.

You can order extra of an item you already have from Scrooge, Con:  Limited how many things you can order a day but is a big limit so not a huge con.


------(minor tips if you do plan to play)-------

Move all fruit trees together for fast run thru harvest.

Horde large amounts of everything if possible.

Crops:  Gather enough of each veggies in each area to have for random cooking places.  Grow crops where they grow faster, the arrow up on seeds show you where, and keep a chest and the sell shop for the area near your farm.  Contain crops  by the shop in a chest.  Makes it easier, and open Forgotten Lands asap for pumpkins to grow and sell for best lazy money.  

Energy Food:  Souflee - cheese, eggs, milk, butter.  You can buy all items from Remy's and once you have your pumpkin farm easy to afford.  It also can almost max your yellow energy bar eating one with a full energy bar, or two with at totally empty energy bar.

Max friendship with the pro booths people asap and keep a chest near their booths for the items you get/buy.  But everything from Kristoff's shop daily that isn't the wood or coal and chest it.  This go for Wallee and his garden too (may need a large chest for this one and some of the others.)

Check Eric's home daily for blueprints till they run out, very few of them here is why I didn't add as a pro.

I absolutely love all the characters making friends, and I love how they interact with objects you put down, like sitting down on the benches and stuff. Makes the town feel very real and alive. 

The plot got way darker than I was expecting, but I appreciate it so much, it was so much fun to play through. One thing I found is that a lot of the time-locked quests get unlocked around the same time, so you end up stuck unable to do some quests for a few days. While I get putting the ""harder"" friendship quests at the higher levels, I think spreading them out at different levels will stop you from getting bottle necked with them. 

I don't agree with the other reviews calling this game pay to win. You can complete all the main story quests without paying for anything, and unlock all the characters and complete their friendship quests. The Wall-e quest was just bonus content. While I do think everything is overpriced, the paid shop is purely cosmetic items, nothing that truly changed or effects your game play. I do think it should be more like a catalogue then refreshing every week. Especially with how little premium currency you can get in the game. That way you can save up for the items you really want. Especially since once it's free-to-play there will be a lot of younger children playing.

EDIT to add: with the new dream-snaps feature, i think the moonstones are balanced for free to play players. While not every week, I have had times where I've scored more than enough to buy an item from the premium shop. I still do not like the rotating stock, and it takes away the fun of saving up for something you want. But between the dailies and the dream snaps, you should be able to buy premium items often enough id you put in some effort to your pictures.",1690906330,1696887511,True,1,0,0.518716573715209961,0,True,False,True

I enjoy coming back to this game for big patches or holiday events, but for now there isn't much to keep me playing long-term as there was at the start of a new game. I love the nostalgic childhood feeling of interacting with your favorite Disney and Pixar characters, which you can't find with other games, I like the variety of the available things to do, but after a few weeks it becomes tedious, like with many farming sims. The developers seem to be passionate about their project, even though people are put off by in-game purchases (moonstones), they are not vital for core gameplay. This is a very nice and relaxing game to play if you are looking for a casual and friendly farming sim. 

Personally, I would love it if the developers would add more steam achievements, for example for completing collections, for unlocking secrets that can be missed by many players, fully upgrading specific buildings, harvesting 1000 pumpkins etc. The possibilities for this are practically endless, as there are so many things to do it this game even in its early access state, and it would give incentive for many completionists and achievement hunters such as myself to continue playing the game, especially once it is out of early access.

Scrooge shop was fixed for PC, dreamsnaps were added to help with the moonstones, pretty happy with the changes. I still hope past star paths become available to those who didn't join early access though. For now though, I am satisfied enough to change to a recommend.

-------------------------
I love this game but the scrooge shop is glitched still and the prices for items/moonstones is unethical and greedy. I am losing my love for this game due to how money-hungry Disney is being. How can we enjoy the game when you haven't even left early access and are already rivalling The Sims 4 in prices if you buy all the shop items? Very discouraging that so many items are behind a paywall in the first place, but then to make the prices so outrageous is even more insulting. I also don't think it is fair that newer players can't get all the star path items from the past? I got them all thank goodness but if I were a new player I would not even bother bc I love getting ALL the items in the game and that is discouraging to those who may want to join later once it is free to play. I can't recommend this game until the moonstone prices & shop items are taken care of.",1686513034,1695246796,True,0,0,0.545288503170013428,0,True,False,True

They need to make a lot of improvements and fixes still,  But overall I like it alot and im Cautiously optimistic.  Seriously tho, the Cash Shop is More like Richie Rich expensive than Scrooge McDuck, They need to Seriously lower all the prices accross the board while making sure to constantly add New and compelling content to the Scrooge in Game store. 

What I like most-
magical theme
Real time weather and lighting
Variety of themes
Holiday celebrations
Beautiful to look at
Photo contest is cool, but yeah..


Dont like at all-

Stamina bar, it is NOT fun running out of stamina and back and forth to house to rest. Not even a LITTLE. Takes long enough as it is to pick/plant/water crops

No tree cutting, you pick up twigs... Ok, i guess...

Not enough in free item store, not enough to decorate with.

Worlds are a bit too small.

Cant change ur character name

NPCs often just get in your way

Npcs can only be assigned to One trade, One time

Cant access Event Decorations- For instance, the Holiday stuff should be available for sale from IN game free shop for everyone.  At least the basic stuff. 

No social Anything, The NPCs will follow you and provide buffs to the few shallow craft/gather skills in the game. 

Materials are WAY too Scarce, and WAY to time intensive to grow (in the case of crops.)
The Fishing Skill is the only one in a ""acceptable"" state, Crops are Meh, again, WAY too time consuming and the NPCS just hinder it more, even with the buffs, youre wasting time running around picking up the extra crops and such ur assigned NPC drops ALL OVER THE PLACE.

This game needs a TON of work, and in some cases, an Overhaul (Trade skills) 

Minimal craft skills and they are basic as it gets- Mining, Fishing, Crops, Cook. Thats it. 

No exploration. At all.  You open a new world, walk around it in under 3 minutes, thats it. 

Minimal pets, you can friend wildlife, but just not the same...


They need to worry Less about the cash shop, which honestly has NO business in this game until its ready for Launch and NOT in beta.  They need to focus More on Adding depth to this beautiful game with Potiential...  

I got my 25.00 worth, but will this game hold my attention for the long haul?  No, not as it is atm  I actually Find Palia to be superior in every way except the magical Moments a Disney coat of pain Can SOMETIMES inspire...

For instance, Palias social and crafting is already LIGHT YEARS ahead of Dream VAlley",1694697256,1694697256,True,33,1,0.765132784843444824,0,True,False,True

It's great that you can make and design your own clothes, and that's one of the best parts of it. It's a nice, chill game for the most part, and it's pretty to look at.

Unfortunately, the game syncs with real-world time, which means that if you're nocturnal like me, you will only ever see the game then, and several characters, including the only one I especially like, are asleep for 3-4 hours of the main time I'm available to play the game. So now the only real reason for me to play the game is not even available for most of the time I'll be free to play.

Additionally, while I understand that the Ratatouille movie has a wide range of dishes, I found the kind of huge seafood fixation a little gross. It's nice there are specifically vegetarian dishes, but it also expects you to make other dishes for achievements that you might not be comfortable making. On that same note, the fishing isn't very enjoyable and the first option in your inventory shouldn't be to eat the fish, that's insane and frankly made me feel like putting the game down for good.

It's nice that you have warnings for things that might upset people, but you seemed to forget about that definitely being something that will upset people that's really easy to do. The Magical World series did a much better job of addressing the fishing element, which seems unfortunately obligatory for games anymore, and it's rarely done well.

The only other major problem I had with the game was that the sprint doesn't work. For some reason, a lot of games recently have struggled with controller support, I don't know why. But this may be something that just will be addressed soon. The game is in early access, and things are being updated all the time.

I liked seeing WALL-E and Merlin. I'm not honestly the biggest fan of some of the movies in the game, and I absolutely hate some of them, but at least they're presented in a fun way, and more characters are being added regularly. It's easy to imagine that most people will be able to find someone to like.

Hopefully the problems will be addressed. I'd imagine most people would enjoy the game, but most people also might want to wait a little longer, so there's more content they can enjoy.

But you have to be prepared for some ressource grinding, and some times the game mechanics, as well as what to do next on missions, aren't very well explained. Luckily Google exists and there are plenty of tutorials online, should you be in doubt of what to do.

The game even gives you a trigger warning when you get to the emotionally heavy stuff, which I personally was really happy about... I mean I still cried my eyeballs out, but at least I was warned.

One last addition, some times the game bugs out on you, in a kind of loading state (FLASH WARNING this could start an epileptic seizure), after placing the characters homes or making major decorative changes to the valley and/or your home.

The bar for Early Access has now been set very high! 37 hours in and I still have not reached the end of the available quests and stories.

I would like to update my review. It is now July 2023 and I do not recommend the game to others. I am very frustrated with the direction of the pay to play model that the game has taken. I paid a lot of money to play early access and have a game with bugs and lag problems but the company has started pay walling quests and items a lot. They promised not to do this until it was out of early access and that is not the case. The current items and quests up for grabs cost almost as much as buying the game again. Wait for the game to be free before you try this one and know they are going to to limit what you can do without paying a ton of micro transactions.

Sept 2023. I am cautiously optimistic. They introduced Dreamsnaps, a way to earn moonstones to off set the pay to play model. I think this is a good step forward for people to be able to participate in the pay to play items without needing to spend a lot of real money. Dreamsnaps is a neat concept, but the camera function is still garbage so its weird to have a whole contest revolving around fuzzy photos with weird angles.",1665276761,1694351819,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As the game is currently it's functional for me. The developer finally got a lot of the bugs fixed although problems do persist for people it is much better. The game is extremely grindy and has honestly reached a point I consider tedious. It feels like an endless grind for iron ore while holding our breath and hoping the next snippet of content doesn't break too much of the game. If you have a ton of free time and enjoy Disney it may be an okay game. If you have little time to devote to a game honestly I cannot recommend this game at all for you.

Edit as of 9/8/2023
I quit playing this game and decided to check it out before the upcoming update. If I had to choose one word to describe the game as it is currently that word would be disgraceful. They cut down the moonstones you get from chests from 100 to 50. They still have not fixed a quest from 92 days ago. Unacceptable. Deplorable. Greedy. They're monetizing it like a it's a mobile game.

At first, I had this one the switch, but decided it wasn't running quite as well as it should, so I picked it up here. The quests are pretty fun, the story line was intriguing, and it gives enough for each update to allow for a really good amount of gameplay. As long as they continue to expand and release more characters, I can see this being a game I continue to play for a long time. 

If I had any complaints, it would be the lack of variety in dialogue and the new shop that really seems more cash-grabby than anything. I don't think the points you collect from chests is nearly enough to keep up with that shop, even after they increased how much you got from them. I would recommend evening that out before release, because up until you launched that, I was so relieved to have a Disney themed game that didn't try to constantly take my money. I understand they have to fund the game, but considering everyone playing right now has paid for the early access, I would hope that would off-set it a little bit.

With an additional hours on the game, I'd like to give a quick update.  Having already spent $70+ USD on my 2 copies (PC/switch), I was going to continue playing despite my initial review. Get that bang for my buck.  First, I want to give credit where due. The snapshot contest update does help some of the moonstone concerns. I enjoy the challenges and seeing other players creations. However, the most recent update has increased the number of crashes substantially. And I'm pretty sure the original amount of moonstones I had on my switch disappeared during a sync after saving to the cloud on my PC, as the amount of moonstones originally varied by device.  
With these crashes and issues syncing, this is just for the primary location. The game teases other locations beyond, so what happens as the game grows?  I think there is still a lot of room for improvement all around, but at the end of the day, I absolutely love the story lines thus far and the plot. I still have concerns that at the end, it will still require spending bank to unlock future locations, quest lines, etc. Even with this snapshot challenge, I'm not sure that's enough to change my mind. Also, these Star Paths, will they repeat once the game goes free? Or is this content a one shot?  There are longish gaps between paths and I'm not sure I understand how this is going to scale. I have a lot of questions, but will keep an open mind.

I really wish I was writing a positive review. With over 200 hours on my steam account, and having 2 copies (steam AND switch), I love the plot of this game. It's everything I have ever wanted in an RPG, playing with your favorite disney pals. But this game is not even out of early access and the devs are already price gouging the hell out of this game. It's quickly ruined what would have been my favorite game of all time. And let me be clear. If there were later DLC after full launch, I wouldn't be this upset. But the latest special pack is 4000 Moonstones ( 5500 Moonstones cost $17.99) for a few outfits. I understand needing funding but to price gouge before 1.0? Ridiculous. Between the events, the premium shop and now this special packs? You will never be able to 100% complete this game without spending bank. If you have not already given in and purchased the game, save your money and the heartbreak.  Disappointing to say the least

I will compare DDV to AC a bit  since both games are pretty similar and have played to both.

This game has been a lot of fun so far, something I did not get much from playing Animal Crossing on the switch.
I felt like Animal Crossing was very lacking, repetitive and got boring quickly, no matter how cute it is, I couldn't bring myself to play (especially after the game stopped getting any updates).
AC had no plot, something DDV actually has.
 After almost a year of playing (DDV is celebrating its first anniversary tomorrow), I still feel engaged to play DDV.

DDV Pros:
-----------
-First, the villagers are all Disney and Pixar characters we know and love (or maybe love to hate for some).
-Both heroes and villains are living in your valley.
-They all have their own different questlines on the side of the main storyline quests.
-The game is still growing, got many updates since the early access launch and many more to come.
-You can customize some outfits and furnitures.
-The soundtrack is great and full of Disney classics.
-You can now get more moonstone currency for free by doing Dreamsnaps (and generous amount if your placement is high)
-Dreamsnaps are a fun creative weekly challenge keeping you engaged in the game and you get rewarded for doing them.


Cons:
-----------
-As expected from an early access game, you will sometimes run into some glitches, don't get them much anymore but it is still worth mentioning.
-You can run out of things to do if you rush the game in its current state (if you don't rush, you'll be fine).
-The pricing for the premium items and moonstones is quite expensive in my opinion, but since the dreamsnap update, it is a bit easier to get them for free so there's that.
-Maui is too big and annoying, always photobombing and blocking the way.


Overall, I think it is a game definitely worth playing if you like cozy games and even more if you like Disney!",1693954058,1693961068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its completely age appropriate, so the whole family can play ! To me, its very relaxing. I have played for hours on end without getting bored of it. My only disappointment, is that once you level your character up to 40, and the villagers to 10, that's it, there is no progression until a new villager is released, so basically, once you max out, its all about collecting items and decorating your village. Which is fine for me, but some people are frustrated by that. Hopefully they will raise the max level in the future. I own the ultimate version, and I think it was well worth the price for the extra items I got.

With 200+ hours of the time of writing you'd think I would recommend this game and you'd think I would have finished everything there was to finish in this game but for some reason Devs of indie games are much faster and better in fixing mayor bugs than whatever this misery this is supposed to be. For over 2 months I've been waiting for them to fix issues with the main quests that stops me (and a lot of others) from progressing and at this point it's getting ridic. I love Disney but obviously with 200+ hours I have nothing left to do other than check the shop once a day and hope for updates. That I can't even finish the main quest line is an absolute bummer, considering I was one of the nutjobs who bought the ultimate Edition but I guess that's on me. While the characters are absolutely lovely and the graphics are great, there's not a lot of love or passion put into the game and it just feels like something they pulled out to just milk the Disney title for cash. For example, when you finish a quest line with a Character like putting up a stage for a certain character and you run around preparing everything for it and talking to the other characters just to put the crafted stage down and then straight jump to short black screen and then instantly to the take a picture screen while everyone around is happy, quest line character talks about how great it all was but YOU. DON'T. ACTUALLY. GET. TO. SEE. ANY. OF. IT. Wheres the magic? All of the prepping and running around for nothing. It feels so unrewarding and loveless. Ever heard of cut scenes? (Oh wait. Right. Not your forte as it seems, since a cut scene is what broke my main quest.) Maybe they will add this in the future but we should soon reach the end of Early Access so I highly doubt it will be added and what will be the point for people like me who already finished every Character possible. We'd never get to experience it unless we decide to trash our game. (And why would we do that?) Time Traveling is a possibility but bugs your whole game apparently, I've seen the threads and it scared me into not doing it. If it's possible and therefore allowed (?) why does it mess up the whole game? But talking about bugs.. Let's not speak about the other hundreds of bugs that seemingly never go away. Like normal things that freeze the game or makes stuff impossible to pick up like it doesn't exist but is there and is clearly in the way. Scrooges Dress/Outfit options are a huge bummer too. (I mean those displayed in the window) It's just the same stuff over and over again, just recolored and it's really not a lot of options either. For me he has not been displaying a new Outfit there in forever. Dreamsnaps is a nice little addition for people done with the game but it keeps you busy for like 20 minutes every once a week and that's about it. Whats highly bothersome about Dreamsnaps is that when it's an Outfit challenge, why in the cursed Te Fiti is there still not an Option to create different styles, name them, and save them. Because sometimes I don't want to change my damn Outfit or would like to get at least back to it without having to look forever for what I was originally wearing. That this still not a feature in a game like this where customization is such a big deal, is really baffling to me. Lastly, I'd like to address the 'nothing to do' sadness on this game. If the Character had needs (like in Sims for example) at least there would be something to do, though I'm not sure if it would be enough at this point to actually interest me anymore. Or events other than those that are Real-Life related. Characters wanting to hang out and do something together. Mini games with the other Characters. And for that one, there's so many options... Hide and seek, stargazing, picnics, who catches most fish, cooking the best dish, themed crafting and so on. (If any of this makes it into the game, you're welcome and I expect my cut or hire me because my brain is an idea factory.) Because right now I'm living in a village with repetitive Ghosts. And now to wrap it up.. Why is the only thing you can do with most items is to turn them on and off (when there's a light or Screen involved). It would be great if the arcades actually had playable mini games on them and other items/furniture would be more interactive like Spin the Globe, pop out Toast of the Toaster, turntables/DJ booth with actual playlists and.. no never mind. I ain't getting paid for this, the Idea Factory is closed now and I ranted enough. But lastly, while talking about items and furniture.. Why can't we put items on just all the surfaces. Look at the newly released open Beta and f2p game ""Palia"" for example. I don't wanna be sitting here advertising for another game... BUT they have done decorating possible like champs, anything that has a surface, you can put items on, even on chairs and sofas! And not just ONE item on one surface but many items on one surface, depending on the size. (Already have nothing to do on that game either - for now. So don't want to praise them too much but you get the idea). And with this, I'm done here now. I held back on writing this review in hope the main quest would be fixed by now but waiting 2 months + with them being well aware of the issue, is my limit at this point.",1693927742,1693928939,False,12,2,0.603250622749328613,0,True,False,True

All of the quests are very enjoyable. I like the fact that you can create your character however way you'd like and the outfits and accessories are adorable.

Music changes with biomes and even with who you are hanging out with. Wall-E and Stitch are my boys. Story is good enough to enjoy. After finishing all the character and story quests, it's a good game for cozy chill vibes.

My issues with the game:
- Where is Kida? So many Atlantis references and zero Atlantis characters.

- Star Paths. Missed a star path? Just bought the game? Gameloft hates you.

- DreamSnaps. You'll (most likely) never be in the Top 5. Accept your measly 300 moonstones, clothing/furniture, and be on your way.

- Real Time schedules are no good for working adults.

- Stuttering/Lag/Tearing issues. There are a variety of ways to trigger and fix them.

- Insane time-sensitive events. To get certain villagers like [spoiler]Stitch[/spoiler], you have to wait a whopping two weeks and that's if you keep up with the quests to progress it. 

- Digging.

- No sprinklers.

- No recycling.

- No cooking more than one at a time or repeat last recipe option. (I like making fruit cake with 4 gooseberries.)

- Moonstones = Cash Shop.

- Water required housing placement can be difficult to design around.

- LET ME MOVE THE ******* [spoiler]TREE HOUSE IN THE FORBIDDEN LANDS[/spoiler]!

- Very limited pathing/fencing options.

- Dashing only when your energy meter is golden.

- Can only officially feed critters once a day. Extra feedings don't count towards duty completions, both regular and Star Path.",1693856551,1693856551,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Honestly, this game has had a bumpy ride, as someone who's been here since the launch of it. There's been many times fans and myself alike haven't been too happy with Gameloft as developers with some sketchy decisions they've made with the game. (There is no denying, though, that they've put their heart and soul into this game and is the reason I decided to leave a review when I've never left a Steam review in my life.) At this point in time, however, Gameloft have surpassed my expectations on the excellency of this little Animal Crossing-esque life simulator. They've made the Premium currency (Moonstones, used to buy Star Paths - which are essentially battle passes...minus the battling - and other in-game goods) much easier to earn without paying real money, all due to the Dreamsnaps update, which essentially is a competition of who can fit the theme and take the most aesthetically pleasing photo the best. You can win up to 4000 Moonstones each week, which to me is insane. Granted, I'm not that good at the competitions but I have won my fair share which is neat. Might I add, in the Dreamsnaps competitions, it isn't a popularity contest as there is no way to view the user's name or profile, and the Dreamsnap photos that come up are random. Perhaps the algorithm plays a slight part in the likelihood of winning or getting a few thousand Moonstones, but even if you come in the lower percentile, you are still likely to earn 600+ Moonstones (I've never won below that, so correct me if I'm wrong).
Honestly, this game is one of my favourite games ever - as a lifelong Animal Crossing fan. Here comes the kicker: it's BETTER than New Horizons by a long shot, too! 
If the devs decide to muck the game up, I will likely update this review. But like I said, at this point in time it's almost flawless - especially on PC where performance issues and glitches aren't common at all, at least in my experience.
If you're a Pixar/Disney fan, this is a MUST-PLAY; if you're a life sim fan, also a MUST-PLAY; if you're a casual gamer looking to wind down and relax after a long day (especially if you have a Steam Deck; or, in my case, an Ayaneo Geek -- curse you, Valve! Release the Steam Deck in Australia already pl0x), it's a MUST-PLAY. However, if you're a ""hardcore"" gamer (shooters, battle royales, violent video games), I don't think this is the game for you.
If all of this sounds good with you, just remember they're also adding multiplayer towards the end of 2023 and updates are planned until at least 2025. Insanely cool, in my opinion.
I'd better mention this, too: This game is supposedly going free-to-play eventually, rumoured to be around October 2023, so if you want to hold off, I'd recommend doing so as (at least in AUD) the Ultimate package is quite expensive.
This review is going on for far too long, so let me leave it with this:

Pros: 
-An amazingly made game with solid chill farming gameplay.
-Lots of way to decorate your island and home.
-Lots of amazing characters and outfits.
-A great story.
-Lots of things to do.

Cons:
The cash shop. The cash shop in its entirety. Now people will say they warned us about the cash shop and that you can earn those items in game from the star path, that is true. However, there isn't enough currency in the star path to get everything from the cash shop and the cash shop is constantly rotating. That means if you miss an item it isn't coming back. 

This may not be a big deal to a lot of people, it wasn't to me either because I played for the story. That is until I realized that now the only new houses you can get are on that cash store unless they add more to the story line. Almost all the new character outfits and forms are locked behind not just the star path but now the cash shop. I was looking forward to grinding to get the new summer outfits but nope, they are in the cash shop. The moment I cannot earn any new cool things in game and its all going to the cash shop, that shows me in order to enjoy anything new I will have to pull out my wallet. 

So yes, I do like this game, I just don't like what the cash shop has become. I understand this game will become free at some point but right now its not. The prices of some of the items are pretty high as well. I am okay with paying more money for things like dlc with more characters and story, but not cosmetics.

If you don't mind the cash shop, yes I recommend this game. It is very good. Just be careful about that cash shop, don't spend any money on things you aren't sure you actually want.",1693257840,1693257840,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,True

     You would think that for as many hours I have played this game that I would fully recommend it, but I don't, really. I bought the cheapest version, and refuse to spend anymore money on it. I just save my moonstones from blue chests to spend on the events. Speaking of which, I used to get 2 blue chests a day, but for the longest time now, I only get one per day.
     At first it's a lot of fun, collecting characters, critters, clothing, etc., but it really just gets tedious after awhile. I have to turn off all the voices and sounds because those get annoying really fast. The quests are all just fetch quests. 
     The thing I enjoy the most is changing my wardrobe, but even that gets old. 
     Decorating my house is okay, but you can't really interact with things. As a long time player of the Sims, I wish I could do more with my house and the items in it. 
     I've played so long that there is rarely anything new in Scrooge's shop, and when there are things, they are often just stuff I can make myself in the customization area - things like different colored head wraps and turbans, or tee shirts with motifs I could make myself. 
     I like the new Dream snaps event, because it is a good way to get more moonstones. I also liked the Potato quest to get the rainbow fox.
     Speaking of critters, I have collected almost all of them, but there are a few rare ones that only show up once in awhile, and  sometimes even after feeding them their favorite food, I still don't get to collect them, so I don't know if that's some kind of bug or what. Edit: Apparently you need to feed some of the critters more than once, but who knows how many times. So that makes it really hard to collect the ones that only show up once a week.
     I am not a fan of the in game clock because sometimes the only time I have to play is at night, at it's so dark in-game that it is really hard to see anything. I don't really like when it's foggy, either, for the same reason. Edit: I found that in the graphics setting, it is possible to offset the time to combat playing in the dark, so that helps. In in-game clock remains, but at least I can see what I'm doing. Now they just need an option to turn off the grass.
     I do like that it's controller friendly, because I play on PC with a controller, but I do find that setting up furniture and decorations is a little easier with a keyboard and mouse. 
     There have been some bugs in the game, but the devs seem to correct those pretty quickly, and usually they will give some sort of compensation. 
     After you've collected pretty much everything, there isn't really much to do in the game anymore. I log into it each day just to see if there's anything new in Scrooge's shop (usually not), and to find the blue chest. Other than that, I just wait for a new event to come up. 
     I think it would be nice to be able to make some of the characters stay in their houses. I don't like some of them, and wish they weren't wandering around all the time and talking to me if I get too close to them.",1692987459,1693234452,True,108,7,0.853934407234191895,0,True,False,True

- Invest in okra early! Make a big ol' plot of okra to farm and sell. It will really kick start your gold amounts.
- The more friends you have in a skill (and the higher friendship you have with said friends), the better the bonuses are! Doesn't matter which friend you have equipped, so I recommend switching out friends when you max out a friendship. Make sure you have plenty of buddies in every skill.
- Speaking of ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING WITH A BUDDY! EVERYTHING! It will make you level up so much faster.
- The game is in early access. It has bugs. Live with it.
- Buy out clothing from Scrooge when you can. Furniture cycles but I find clothes don't really cycle well. But once you own it, it shouldn't repeat so it's good to buy things just so you can find what you want.

I've finished all there is currently in the game but for a new player there is loads to do already and I'm looking forward to seeing what they add and what new characters are going to be added, as it's Disney the list if almost endless :D

Star path can sometimes feel like a chore but otherwise the tasks are mostly pretty simple.
I wish you could craft more than one food item at a time, maybe a max of 5 or something would be good.
Placement of items can sometimes be a little annoying and I wish you could place things a lot closer together.

But other than those few picky things I'd definitely recommend the game if you're looking for something chill to play and enjoy games that are sim like :)


Update: 
So they added a premium shop, which seems to change items every 5 or so days and the items it sells are cosmetic, house items, decorations, outfits, hair styles and so on. The catch being you need moonstones to buy these item sets and the pricing is not good much like any other games that have micro transactions..
You can find moonstones in blue chests as you play but nowhere near enough to be able to get a set of items or all 4 sets from the premium shop... So if you really badly want that stuff you buy moonstones with real money. For this reason i wouldn't recommend the game as it's just ridiculous, I knew they where adding in the ability to buy moonstones at some point and i should have known the pricing would not be good.
You do not have to buy the items to enjoy the game and i would never suggest buying the items from the premium shop or buying moonstones but hopefully it's your money and you do with it what you please.
They could have easily added other tasks for limited times where those items were rewards or popped them in Scrooges shop for a high gold price, you know the currency that you don't pay for.

Premium shop and moonstones are a huge no no. I wish there was a mixed option when writing a review as i personally do really like the game as there is tons to do and its pretty relaxing, but the premium shop is not necessary, there should be other ways to get pretty items, like you know, quests or scrooge's shop.

Ignoring the premium shop and the buying of moonstones, i would still recommend the game.


Update 2: I just wanted to add some more thoughts about the moonstones and premium shop. The chests you can find that have moonstones in them now have 50 stones, the store still rotates items and the items seem to come back around occasionally that I've seen. 
What I really want to say in this updated review bit though is out of all the games that have micro transactions that I've played, Disney Dreamlight Valley is one of the better ones. Since playing the game through a lot of updates and star path seasons I've managed to get extra tasks for most of the star path seasons (which you unlock with moonstones, I missed one though) and buy some things from the premium store, all WITHOUT buying moonstones! 

I've managed to do all that because there are a few ways you can get moonstones for free!, of course you still have the chests you can find but now they also have a dream snaps competition each week and you can earn moonstones just by participating!

I'm not saying that I now love micro transactions woohoo! No I still think they're not good but unfortunately that's how a lot of games are now, I'm just saying that Disney Dreamlight Valley is more giving to their players, which is surprising because, well, 'Disney' haha.

Anyway as I mentioned, I've not bought a single pack of moonstones and I personally don't plan on it as I can get them just by playing, there have been certain things in the store that I just personally don't care for but if you are someone who wants it all! You'll probably have to spend some money to get it all.


Disregarding the store completely though, the game is still very much enjoyable and you don't need anything from the premium shop to enjoy it.",1669195225,1692616658,True,14,0,0.652881503105163574,0,True,False,True

*Do not be the minnow that justifies some whale spending thousands of dollars, pretending they are better than you because you don't have shiny X or Y.

*Do not be the whale who spends thousands of dollars just for digital shiny toys that will vanish as soon as servers are closed.

*Do not be the attempted whale who gives up their savings and the rent, just to see yourself on a leader board.


This is a game that sports an E rating. This kind of behavior should not be present in any game playable by young children. The game is good. That is one reason it sucks to not recommend the game. However it is becoming a dangerous trend for 'gaming' companies. (Even D&D is working hard to figure out how to cash in on whales... Thanks Hasbro.)

               Original Review Below
------------------------------------------------------------

The game is enjoyable enough to recommend it. It is charming and easy to get into for short periods of time. I won't go into graphics, sound, stories, etc. Those are subjective and you can see them for yourself in various videos and streams. I will point out what I feel are problems in the game so you can make an informed choice.

Again, I do actually recommend the game, especially if you are looking for something a young child can enjoy.

The Ugly:
*Seasons have been unbalanced. The quests do not give you enough season points to buy everything. You end up paying 100 moonstones for enough  season currency to get 90 moonstones.
*Most of the season content is locked behind a paywall. (A good 4/6 of the content.)
*Custom clothing creator is so clunky, you'd think it was from the early 90s.
*A lot of the tasks, especially seasonal ones, lack clarity. Example ""Trick-or-Treat"" doesn't exactly explain what you need to do.
*Landscaping ruins what little chance you have of collecting items from harvest-able items that 'explode'.
*Decorating is a little clunky. (HOWEVER, this comes from a Sims player bias.)
*Cooking menu does not allow you to make multiple of a dish at once.
*Cooking menu has some other non-optimized issues.
*Most items only stack to 99. While a lot of quests will ask for 100 of something.",1673553576,1692497527,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

No extra digital content. No extra Moonstones. Just the game. I don't regret it one bit. 

Before buying, please be aware that this is a game you can easily put 100 hours into. I've had it less than a month and have put in just over 60. I play most days for up to 3 hours. As someone with ADHD who loses her brain every day at some point, this helps me feel accomplished with the quests, which there is no shortage of. I highly recommend looking up the secret potato quests as well once you're further in the game. 

A brief rundown of the game:
You (the player) are the ruler of Dreamlight Valley, a universe which has gone through some major changes since you were last there, namely dark magic. All of the Disney characters are aware of and friends with each other but some of their memories are completely wiped due to this magic. Part of the gameplay is helping them and yourself remember the events leading up to the Forgetting. You have a few Disney villagers to start with and can unlock others in a multitude of ways. There are six biomes to unlock using Dreamlight, which is basically points you can get by doing things you'd normally do every time you login but there are daily tasks to help you focus on getting Dreamlight more quickly.
You level up characters by talking to them once daily, gifting favorite gifts, and hanging out with them to do a specific task after Level 2 has been reached which you assign them. For example, Scrooge is assigned to mining in my game and if you take him along when you're mining, he'll give you extra gems along the way. 
Some quests will take you no time at all and are extremely intuitive. Some will require a lot of resources and using your buddies in order to get extras over a number of days. I'm currently on Minnie's Level 7 quest and it is A LOT. Don't feel bad if you have to look something up. I've had to do it too.
To start off, I recommend trying to save 50 of your basic resources you need for crafting and of food for recipes. This really helped me knowing that before I started playing. I hope if you decide to buy that you have a great experience like I have.

only 'con' is that i wish it to have more interactive stuff, like things you can actually use or do. even without real sense, but for example: kitchenstuff like mixer should have mixanimation, a pool u can actually swim or chill in, etc. (just like the lights and chimney can be turned on and off) - most things are just decoration and if you're done with all missions, far gone and have the most items, things gettin little lifeless and stiff. So just a little more things to do just out of boredom. I hope you get what i mean.

1401590,122053065,76561198238772120,0,18,20109,1018,101,1708122387,"Allow me to share my perspective. When it comes to my approach, I've been an avid Disney enthusiast for as long as my memory serves me. I've indulged in nearly every noteworthy Disney movie and series. While there have been occasional attempts at creating games set in Disney's enchanting realm, sadly, only a handful have managed to stand out as truly remarkable. Please note that I'm excluding games like Kingdom Hearts from this category; we all recognize the greatness of Kingdom Hearts, given its significant Disney influence. Regrettably, most Disney games haven't received the attention and appreciation they rightfully deserve from their creators. However, the title I'm addressing here seems to deviate somewhat from this trend.


Let me commence by offering an overview, wherein I'll discuss both the positive and negative aspects, divided into three distinct categories: story, graphics & design, and gameplay. I'll conclude with a list of pros and cons.


The central narrative revolves around your endeavor to revive Dreamlight Valley to its former splendor and thwart the encroaching dark force known as the Forgetting. Early on, you receive guidance from Merlin, leading you to discover your latent magical abilities. You embark on a journey to clear the Night Thorns from this world and extend your assistance to Disney and Pixar characters who've sought refuge in the Dream Castle within the valley. Naturally, a truly immersive experience of encountering a multitude of Disney and Pixar characters isn't complete without forming meaningful bonds with them. Through my hands-on experience with the game, I had the opportunity to witness how you can nurture friendships with this endearing cast by engaging in frequent conversations, fulfilling their quests, and inviting them to spend time with you. As you partake in joint adventures – be it mining, fishing, or other activities – your camaraderie will flourish. You can even whip out your personal device and snap a selfie with your newfound friends. While you're busy unraveling the mysteries behind The Forgetting, you'll harness Dreamlight magic to dispel the Night Thorns that have plagued the world. By completing quests and aiding villagers, your reserve of Dreamlight magic grows, a crucial asset for vanquishing more resilient thorns obstructing various regions. Additionally, a mechanism called Dreamlight Duties parallels the Nook Miles concept from Animal Crossing: New Horizons, wherein engaging in activities and objectives, such as collecting a set amount of fruit, yields more magical power. Each character embarks on their own narrative journey, accompanied by associated quests. Furthermore, magical portals within the Dream Castle grant you passage to diverse Disney realms, ranging from the dilapidated planet of Wall-E to the captivating domain inhabited by Moana. Solve puzzles and partake in activities within these realms to potentially bring Wall-E or Moana back with you.


From a graphical and design perspective, the game boasts stunning visuals. This game serves as a testament that it doesn't require hyper-realistic graphics to be visually captivating. Intricate details grace various objects and characters, while the liberty to fashion your unique character is an exhilarating aspect. Personally, I believe the chosen design aligns seamlessly with the game's essence. Notably, I haven't encountered any graphical glitches thus far, although I must admit my attention was somewhat diverted due to the overall immersive experience and excitement that accompanied my gameplay.


This aspect poses the most pronounced area for potential enhancement. The game operates in real time, meaning that if it's nighttime in reality, the game world also transitions to night. Evidently, specific characters adhere to distinct routines and pursuits, mirroring the passage of time. Although I haven't invested sufficient playtime to ascertain the full extent of nocturnal impact, it's disheartening that the option to deactivate the real-time feature remains unavailable. This oversight presents a challenge for those whose play schedules are restricted to specific times due to work or other commitments. Overall, the controls and fundamental gameplay demonstrate commendable performance. Naturally, some refinements would be welcomed, yet it's encouraging that the developers continue to dedicate substantial efforts toward enhancing the game, differentiating it favorably from other Disney titles.

Pros:
- Engaging Story
- Intriguing Gameplay
- Captivating Graphics
- Beloved Disney Characters (Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy, etc.)

Cons:

- Inability to Disable Real-Time Mode
- Screenshots Taken Not Registered as Steam Screenshots
- Craving for More Content

Conclusion: Enthralled and Satisfied

In conclusion, I am genuinely enamored with the game. The fact that Mickey Mouse remembered my name heightened my delight to unparalleled levels. It's safe to say that my happiness knows no bounds.

I am not a huge Disney fan, but I did really enjoy (and still miss) the silly sweetness of Toontown Online, and I have uncountable hours sunk into Stardew Valley, so I figured I'd give this a try.  After all, I've got a 2 hour ""buyer's remorse"" window, right?

That window has passed me by, and so far, no regrets.  For an early access game, I'm finding this pleasantly polished.  Not that it shouldn't be, but we all know what those games are usually like, so it's always a nice surprise when they are what they should be.

So, I have a terrible memory, so I'm going to run through my list of pros and cons so far, and as I hit more, I'll edit to add them, just so I can give this game a fair shot and readers a fair snapshot of the game from my perspective.

Pros:
- beautiful artwork, which the screenshots clearly show
- excellent character creation system
   -- I especially appreciated the range of body types to choose from, and would like to see that taken even further
   -- as someone covered in freckles, I was delighted that they included a fully freckled face option AND an option for multi-colored freckles!  I would also like to see this taken further, by adding a freckles option to the character body.
- beautiful scoring, with an option for streamers to switch to non-copyrighted music
- the entire atmosphere is - I don't know what word to use.  Surprisingly?  Oddly?  Pleasingly?  Whatever, it's very calming.  The quests are simple without being insulting, there are puzzle pieces liberally scattered for discovery, the NPCs are always delighted to see you and while they don't always necessarily agree with you (power, mister wizard, I want more magic for more POWER!), they're always very kind and very charming.  Again, not a huge disney fan so didn't really expect to be so happy even with characters I don't really care for outside the game.
- Fishing. No, no I did NOT accidentally put fishing in the PRO column. Congrats to Dreamlight Valley for being the first game I've played of its type to figure out how to make fishing NOT the worst, most annoying, most tedious, most hated activity of the game.

Cons:
- the music is really loud, I mean REALLY loud, I have to turn it down to pretty much 2 notches from the bottom to make it tolerable
- I would like a little more variety in the score than I've heard so far - in the house seems okay, but in the main area it seems like literally all I ever hear is the mickey mouse song - haven't played long enough to know if repeat just doesn't work well or if there's just not a lot of song options for that area, but either way, variety yada yada, spice of life
- would like to be able to pin 2 or 3 quests instead of just 1 so that it's easier to gather everything I need in an area without constantly opening the logbook
- storage!  Artificially limited storage is such a terrible choice. Slapping a 48 slot chest in a person's house then forcing you to spend thousands of coins on house upgrades to free up one line of slots at a time is a great way to make little cuts into that otherwise nice atmosphere I mentioned above.
- movement/targeting is an iiiiiiissue right now
  -- it's very, very hard to make small adjustments with turns, and the game is reeeeeeally picky about you standing JUST right to do something (dig, fish, whatever) in a specific spot.
  -- Except when it's not picky, and you line up JUST right on a spot, and it decides that actually no, you meant that slot to your left and behind you.
  -- Characters are also somewhat pesky, if they are standing near you when you are trying to gather you're going to end up cancelling out of talking  to them a LOT
  -- I include 'zoning' as movement, and there's a loooooot of it.  I'm not sure why, since zoning in most games has been getting less and less, but you have to zone EVERYWHERE in this game. Even in your own home, if you add a room, you have to zone in and out every single time.Zone into the house, zone into room, do what you need to do, zone out of room, zone out of house.  It's very, very tedious.  
- real time syncing - nooooo, whyyyyyy, if someone (like anybody with a job?) generally only has time to play at night this is awwwwwwful, yes I generally only have time to play at night, how did you guess?  It's eternal darkness in my game and I hates it, precious. Updated info: this is becoming more pesky as time goes on. I'm currently staring at my monitor waiting for Mickey to wake up so that I can get a simple photo to complete a quest and move on.  Additionally, Remy is VERY often asleep so that I cannot pull him out to improve his skills or, y'know... hang out with a fun little Disney character because I want to. Currently it's 1am and I am blocked from playing with 5 characters because they're all asleep.  Additionally, sleep schedules do not (from my own observations and from searching I've done) appear to be fixed, so there's no way of knowing when you'll lose a character, or how long until you get it back. I have seen comments suggesting messing with PC time to fix, but other comments say this bugs the game, and honestly?  I don't feel I should have to mess with my system settings twice a day to just... enjoy a game.  This is currently my #1 issue with this game and I very much hope they make some major changes to its current setup.

Apparently this will be free on release so I didn't have to pay for it?  But you know, the world's kinda garbage right now, I was right at the point of having played what I've got without having any clear idea of what else might strike my fancy, and I don't regret throwing $20 at this to poke around early.

Additional edit:

Y-I-K-E-S. Just popped my head back into the game to look at the updates and started doing the fairy godmother quest and... wow, this is terrible.  An incredibly over-simplified view of depression, and just leaps STRAIGHT from yay happy everything is fine to THE WORLD IS TERRIBLE AND I WANT TO DISAPPEAR.  There's a heck of a lot of path in between, and once again I'm going to point out that this game cannot seem to decide if it's for adults or children.  This is far too unnuanced for adults, and far too heavy handed for children.  Also, depicting a depressed person as a villain is REALLY ... what the f?  ""Oh no it's fine, they're going to be redeemed!"" Yes, exactly.  The person needs 'fixing'.  Except depression isn't something you 'fix', it's generally going to mean lifelong treatment, whether that's mental health or medical treatment or whatever.  Meanwhile, Disney has this person acting like one of their old school, no-nuance villains and even dresses them up like a freaking demon.  Come ON.

The real hilarity though is that they have a lot of snark around ""oh what does so and so want NOW"" to underline that ""the Forgotten"" is depressed and viewing things through a warped lens, but like... that literally is what the game is.  The villagers accompany you on quests from time to time but are really just there to follow and watch, and the rest of the time wander around repeating the same lines over and over.  They don't garden, or mine, or gather, or cook, and anytime it's needed to advance the story, it's the main character doing it.  My character just spent a really painfully tedious amount of time logging in and gathering clay then logging out and coming back when it's respawned to build a stupid clock for Minnie, after which she immediately proclaims that the character ought to be in charge of a ""helpers"" club.  WHAT. CLUB.  It's ONE PERSON and a bunch of pre-programmed robots with broken hands.  Lord, I resent having spent money on this, now.  It's terrible writing, it's terrible opinions, it's bad lessons on what friendship actually is... and it's *still* boring and repetitive.",1662848319,1691993868,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is not without its bugs. I am still unable to submit Dreamsnaps via PC, but can do so on Switch. The Switch still likes to crash somewhat regularly. The music stutters with frame rate refresh, which can be annoying at best, frustrating at worst. However the devs do seem to appreciate feedback, and although the help team can sometimes leave a little to be desired regarding communication (or telling me to do things I already outlined I had done whilst reporting bugs) there seem to be regular bug fixes along with the new content drops. 

The characters are fun and charming, of course, although there is a desire for more OG Disney characters to be released, particularly of the Disney Princess Variety, and for me, I would love a couple more characters released at a time instead of just one or two per update. More than likely (I HOPE) this will happen once it is ""free to play"" for all. 

Which leads me to the micro-transactions. Sure, they are ""expected"" when a game is going to be free to play eventually. However, the pricing of the moon stones, the ""real money"" currency, is rather exorbitant for cosmetic items, or even additional DLC with the Dapper Wall-E quest, when directly translating it from real currency to digital. Don't go into playing Dreamlight Valley with a ""completionist"" attitude, or you will be spending a lot of your own money for finishing collections and skins that don't have any final bearing of the game itself. And with the amount of content included in Scrooge's Shop, from character questlines, and from the chests scattered about the Valley daily, there are plenty of outfit and furniture items to keep you stocked for a long time for plenty of customization! However, if you log on regularly enough to find your moonstone chests and complete the Dreamsnaps portion of the game, you can find yourself with sufficient moonstones for purchasing a shop item every so often. I myself prefer to save my moonstones for houses, pet companions, and the various Star Paths they do. 

If you play the game for what it is, which is a relaxing sim where you take your time and don't rush through the quests, and just enjoy the chill vibe the game brings, and don't force a completionist attitude, you will have many, MANY hours of quests, farming, furniture and clothing design, and Valley decorating to do. Log in every day to get your moonstone chest, and save that up for special store purchases or Star Paths, and just enjoy the experience!",1691711040,1691711040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Unfortunately as fun as this game is its become clear that the micro-transactions now implemented in this soon-to-be free to play game are going to break the game (and your bank). You can buy 3 poorly designed items for 1,250 Moonstones or $15AUD(2500) or you can buy the high end premium for 3,750 for a new tool skin/house skin and pay $31AUD(5500) but while these are only cosmetic and thereby not necessary... there's the new Wall-e QUESTLINE that'll cost you 4,000 moonstones or $31AUD and while Aussie exchange rate makes everything near-double what you'd be paying in the US you get the idea. Also if you happen to own/play on different platforms, the moonstones aren't linked which is good because I'm told the console versions have fees on top of the already high prices meaning if you purchase moonstones buy them on PC as it'll be cheaper (not by much but you'll save a few dollars)

Note* You are able to earn 1,500 free moonstones by logging daily and finding the blue chest. You must log daily because they no longer stack (up to 3) like they used to. So if you want to play this game ""free to play"" it'll take you a month to earn enough moonstones for 3 premium items or 2.5months for a skin... however it is recommended you always have at least 2,500 moonstones so you can participate in the starpath that will come out (and if you complete all items you will earn back 2,000 of your spent moonstones)... see the problem there?

(And, I am not the best gamer in  the world by any means, so this game is for all experience types!) Yes, it has occasional bugs, a few newer systems with some kinks, and the moonstone store can be wildly overpriced on some items but fine on others (think 1.2K for 5 furniture items vs 2-3K on a single pet/character costume). However, for all its faults, I have really enjoyed this game's unique experience in the Disney realm of games, as it features more genuine crossovers of characters than many attempts in the past. The game can be played both super casually or all the time, which also helps out if your schedule varies like mine. The overarching story of The Forgetting has been very thought-provoking and meaningful, which was a welcome surprise! (Warning: it can actually get quite dark and really emotional for those that have triggers.) The individual characters all have unique questlines; you can choose how you want your valley to look and operate, and there's always new things to do and discover for all those out there that are completionists looking for some real challenges. You can garden, forage/collect, mine, fish, dig, design, and chill in this game with so many options and characters even in Early Access; you really get to do so much that you can find what floats your boat and really go all-in on it. There's tons of content to come and plenty of things the development team is forever improving, so I would recommend this game to any fan of Disney, relaxed farming-type games, or those looking for some really good story-building even with well-known characters. :) *Note that I play this on a Laptop PC with little-to-no problems with controls and connection.*",1690835125,1690835261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Quests shouldn't be locked behind paywalls, and while I'm not against a cash shop, I am against predatory business practices in an already struggling economy. It's pretty presumptuous of the Dev's to think everyone has 50.00 a week to spend on a game compared to food, shelter, or anything else more important. 

A cash shop is optional and should be treated as an optional thing. By optional, I mean along the lines of a catalog of paid items you can choose from. Not this Fallout 76 style 'limited run' of just a few items you *might* maybe kind of like at heavily inflated prices for a currency you cannot easily access in game. 150 moonstones per day is ridiculous for the amount of product you receive. 

Make a catalog and ditch the fake sense of urgency limited time things bring. If people want it they'll pay for it, you don't need to make a fake sense of scarcity. This feels like something a CEO wanted shoehorned in because 'it works'. It's aggressive and scummy marketing tactics and we aren't stupid. We notice.

I think the Dev's need to look at F2P models that -work- instead of F2P models from whatever game of the moment is popular. You need a fair system for both F2P and premium players with balance to keep people happy. As it stands I see nothing but corporate greed, and that goes wholly against what the characters in this game stand for. Especially Wall-E. Players dishing out real life money to pay for a quest related to that little guy feels like some kind of sick irony against the entire message of the movie he's even associated with. 

Make moonstones more accessible, change the cash shop to a catalog, study current F2P games with fair models and don't follow Sims 4 and give us half a DLC for 30.00. The fact is it's 2023. Players notice when you're practicing unfair business models, make it fair. You should at least do the characters some justice and give them some respect. Otherwise the game will become trash, and you'll lose your core player base while alienating those who can't afford to play.",1690799479,1690799479,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

If you too are a youngish adult who grew up on the Disney/Pixar animated canon, enjoyed Kingdom Hearts and Stardew Valley, and held a Disneyland annual pass at any point in your existence, you may want to check this game out. While the Valley itself is perhaps a bit too confined even with all the biomes unlocked (there are hints of future content updates that will introduce new spaces, though), the production values are lovely, the entire game is peppered with Disney references both blatant and subtle, and the character conversations have genuinely entertaining -- and sometimes even insightful -- dialogue. You also get the opportunity to amass clothing and furniture to transform the entire Valley to your liking, along with getting to participate in special events that unlock even more fun items.

Content warning: this game, while mostly cheery and optimistic, can get astonishingly dark in parts, even for something G-rated, so if you've had any brushes with anxiety or depression, be warned that those themes do appear in the primary storyline, though they are addressed gently.

I knew there was a plot, but I was expecting maybe some ""the power of friendship fixes anything!"" silly little ""plot"" in which I help some Disney characters with their meaningless problems and fix up the village.

Y'all. I wasn't ready.

I appreciate that they've added a content warning in a recent update, because this game got [b]deep[/b]. I don't want to spoil anything, but be ready to sit down with some heavy emotions for a while. It does have a little bit of that Kingdom Hearts-esque ""we're having a heartfelt, dramatic moment, and also Goofy is here"" vibe at times, but it really is a beautiful story about growing up. 

As far as gameplay goes, there are a couple of balancing things I would personally tweak, and it's still early access so expect a couple of hiccups here and there. It really is a beautiful game. My old dinosaur of a computer is still running a 1080, and it can render the best quality graphics without any performance loss. 

My only real complaint is that once you plant a seed, you can't get rid of it until it's fully grown. I want to be able to dig up a crop I accidentally planted so I don't have one pumpkin in the middle of my canola field.

Disney Dreamlight Valley is a game developed and published by Gameloft

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Disney Dreamlight Valley overall, however, is an okay game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a good simulation adventure game and to play in short bursts

It's like a mix of Stardew Valley & animal crossing but 3d & Disney edition.

It's very cute, has lots of amazing character interactions, story quests, home and island management, resources to collect & gather etc..

There's also tons of outfits you can get to mix and match in the game. Super cute ones, very laid back casual ones, sporty ones, school ones, etc.. There's almost one thousand different pieces of clothes you can get which gives you a huge choice of fashion. There's also house skins that you can get to match biomes and stuff as well which is super nice!

I made my Wall-E a farmer to help me grow crops, and when I don't use him sometimes he just stands behind something staring at me, judging me, plotting his moment...but i could never get mad at him or worry because he's way too cute.

If you like very casual games like the ones I listed above this game is definitely worth checking out!",1690456025,1690456172,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,True

There's no rush to finish quests, you can literally just ignore them and farm and decorate if that's what you want to do. That said, you'll need to finish some specific quests to upgrade tools and unlock new characters and places on the map to explore. 

Still a little glitchy here and there but it has a huge potential for growth considering how many characters haven't been added yet. And hey, it's fun hanging out with the Disney crowd as your personal BFFs, and the music is a medley of all the classics so it's really relaxing.

I was very sceptical, thinking I will run out of things to do or it will be for kids. Nah, I love it. <3

Edit after 113hrs played: Still love this game but finishing everything possible in there makes you hit rock bottom and you get bored, because there is nothing much to do after. Waiting for the new update to come soon!

Edit after 167hrs played: With updates coming every few months, there is new stuff to do every time. Game has been expanded amazingly, developers are listening to player's feedback, store has been added into the game with cosmetic items etc. It is on a great path!

Edit after 232hrs played: Game is cool, just feels repetitive and bit limited with not being able to interact with objects, can't sit, only function to this day is to sit on sofas/beds and turn lights on.

The world looks and feels amazing and every new area unlocked offers a breath of fresh air from the central plaza. The gameplay loop of collecting items, levelling friendships and upgrading shops constantly keeps you on your toes and you will always find a new surprise around the corner.

As it's still early days there are a few things that I would like to point out improving. Firstly, the addition of a new skill in the game. Currently you can fish, cook, mine, dig and pick up sticks - slowly these core skills become very tedious and repetitive.

It would also be amazing to see some sort of museum not dissimilar to other games of this genre. There you could collect your fish for example and see them all in an aquarium type room.

Finally and most importantly, aspect ratio on the Steam Deck. Currently, in order to use the full resolution of the Steam Deck screen, you have to run the game in Desktop Mode. Every time I play the game I have to switch to play the game and use this when I think it would be a really easy fix for the dev team to resolve resolution issues on Steam Deck as the game is verified after all, we definitely do not want to play such a beautiful game with letterbox borders!

I like to say this game is a good mix of the games MySims and Animal Crossing with its own little twist. There is so much to do in this game and is a rewarding grind. Would certainly consider this game a cozy grinding game. You can cook tons of different meals with different ingredients spread throughout biomes, build countless different types of furniture, buy stuff at Scrooge's shop (and changes every day), take tons of photos, unlock a good amount of familiar characters and place them in your valley, your house and the valley is completely customizable, and much more. The game starts off extremely simple but once you start progressing you will realize how much there is to discover, and it's a lot more than meets the eye! Again, I have never really considered myself to be a Disney fan and I still find myself geeking out when I unlock certain characters and the game is just fun and relaxing to play. 

My only ""meh..."" is that naturally, they do slither in some micro transactions. The moonstones or whatever they're called. Fortunately, I have never felt pressured to purchase them nor find them necessary to play the game comfortably and it doesn't get in the way of your game play. I think it's similar to a season pass where you can unlock more stuff with events they're holding and things along those lines. But I personally feel like there is enough good stuff in the game to not need it and it does not interfere with the story line or common gameplay. 

If you're hesitant on trying the game because you aren't a huge follower of Disney, in my opinion I say go for it anyway. It's worth it~",1690165679,1690165679,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Enter your house? enjoy 1fps, also you need to do it for the main story so tough shit.
Want a new character outfit? £20 for a cheap reskin and 2 hours of buggy quests.
Out of energy and eating food? Game will eat a random item from your inventory no matter what you clicked on. Hope you werent holding any rare items.
Do you have rare food items from old event that you don't want to cook by accident? Game will autograb it anyway and there is no way to prevent it other than throwing them on the ground and making a pile.
Are you giving an item to a character as part of a quest? you have a 50/50 chance for your screen to freeze and force you to restart.



OLD REVIEW:
Every single one of these damn characters fully expects you to build/repair them a fancy house before they even consider joining your village. If they want to open up a shop, guess who has to pay for it. No you don't get a discount, in fact pay more upgrade it, and they'll still take forever to sell the one item you need. You'd think that would at least make them your friends? Better prepare yourself to treat them to lobster and gold ingots daily, but not too much, they're not desperate. Unlike you.

A word of note - this is one of those awful free-to-play games, but if you bought the early access version like I did it feels more like a traditional game as opposed to a horrible micro-transaction garbage game.

The addition of achievements is nice.  New characters, and some BASIC animations have been added for the new content.  Which really proves... they could add even more.  Simple example - when your character goes to pick something up.  Doesn't matter if it is on a table or on the ground - you will bend over to pick it up like it's on the ground.  Your character still can't open doors (there is no animation for doors moving).  Come on - core gameplay.  Address THAT stuff!

  The game is basically a giant fetch quest.  Again and again and again.  NPCs are constantly blocking your path.  No real voice acting to speak of, when it could easily be accomplished.  And no real cutscenes - whenever something important is happening in the world, 9/10 times the screen fades to black and then lights back up with the change made.  Come on, this is Disney, how about some animation?
   Speaking of which, this is Disney.  Which means it will suck you in regardless.  It sucked me in regardless.  If this were any other IP, I would have walked a long time ago.
  There are some good things here.  My take, if the game is going to basically be a long string of fetch quests, at least jazz it up and give it polish (voice acting / real cutscenes).  And while they're at it - support for DLSS or ray tracing.  Come on, it's Disney.... you know they can afford it.
  This is in early access.  So far, updates have focused on more and more content, which, honestly could come as expansion packs or post release.  I'd really like to see them focus on the core game.

Changes: 

-more improved gameplay stuff like ways to earn moonstones (this is a game kids will play as well so makes sense)

- Add more original characters like the original princesses, and ad a black and white bio-me for the original mickey.

It was brilliant fun at first so I invested in the 80$ Ultimate package. I purchased this under the pretense that 1: it could even halfway function on the switch (it’s been almost a year and it still cannot). 
And 2: That the money I payed for *special edition cosmetic items* and early access would allow me to enjoy all the fun of the game (a HUGE part of this being the decorations and styling our avatars and designing clothing.) 

The storyline was enjoyable-a little lacking but I assumed, when I logged in today after taking a hiatus since probably around dec or earlier of 2022…to see a ton of new developments. Lots of rewards for the total 140$  dollars or so I have spent on this game (trusting that the switch would be fixed and buying the platinum  on steam…) 

At that time-they we’re refunding those who had to buy again and weren’t being given the special edition items. At that time-this game had a lot of promise despite some pretty horrific bugs that made it, tbh, basically unplayable unless on the PC. 

As others have said-this game was advertised falsely.  The “full controller support is false.” It’s actually abysmal. I frequented the discord server for a while as well and yes-as others have said-very policed. I ended up just keeping my mouth shut and leaving. 

To log in today and see that, not only are the bugs just as bad as they were prior-but now those of us who “got the special opportunity to collect items before it became “free to play with micro transactions” have a fun new opportunity to spend what is some of the most inflated pricing for “cosmetics” I’ve ever seen.

I don’t blame devs for this. Im sure they are doing whatever they are able. This is the result of greed. Pure greed. The game has turned into any other phone game where you are essentially just mindlessly doing tasks (with time controls in place) just to get yourself a measly “cosmetics”.

If a fanbase invests money in a beta or early access game-I expect returns for that. And honestly, this has been a slap in the face.

I feel very badly for the devs here and wish them the very best. But Disney has gone mad with this one. This game doesn’t have a large base of younger (or very young fans.) The demographic that already bought this game is the demographic it appealed to. And we were-in more ways than one-basically scammed.

I really enjoyed this game in the start. I enjoyed the discord before I saw what kind of behavior was happening there and fans themselves being treated incredibly poorly. I enjoyed the time I got to spend decorating-in between constant game crashes. I enjoyed the storyline and characters chosen. Doing this to a demographic who spends less on Sims, Planet Zoo, and more-will ruin this games chance at anything. 

It’s a bummer-it was an enjoyable game. But I’m not going to spend every second of my day trying to get the last “free” items we all really payed massive amounts of money for-so I can feel better about the greed that occurred here. 

This is clearly a cash grab. And somehow an incredibly blatant and bold one that appears to have no remorse. 

I cannot recommend this game. At all actually. I do not trust whomever is controlling these prices to not continue this and worsen it.

Not in activities but in no real sense of direction other than asking people for things to do or checking daily tasks. The camera angles and mouse control feels clunky, oversensitive even with adjustment, and not intuitive. I find myself racing through character dialogue in a hope that a task will come from it or I'll get an item that I need for another task. All the blocked off areas should pop up with ""Maybe I should talk to (character name)"" or ""I know that (character name) has something that could help me"" so that we know who we should unlock next. 
This game feels overwhelming with little direction. Whilst some may argue that Animal Crossing has minimal direction it felt cosy, comfortable and easy to sit back and relax with. Dreamlight Valley does not help me relax, rather it ramps up my anxiety as I aimlessly hit things hoping to find items for 7 different tasks I have going at the same time. 

It's not unenjoyable but it is not calming. The characters movement on the screen (heck even the jumping herbs and vegies) is erratic and scary rather than whimsical.

But there are a few bugs. -.-

First of all I noticed that some of the loot lands in spaces where you can never get it (e.g. in a bush in elsas realm or so close to a building that you have to move the building to claim it.)

Secondly since that new Update yesterday (July 19th 2023) when i visit Simbas Jungle the is some random grey sphere floating in a fixed spot, looks odd even when you can walk through it.

also since the update, when I try to transfer inventory to chests via rightclick my char just automatically eats one random food. that is close to the item i rightclicked.

This game is awesome I played it on gamepass when it released and bought it again recently. That being said if I wanted to support the game I would one by the game, and two buy the deluxe or ultimate upgrade. It disappointed me to see that some quest were locked behind moonstones, I've seen some people say this is a way to support devs which is true... if you are just plain stupid the ultimate edition is 100 smackaroos that seems like good enough support to me. As well as the passes giving you less moonstones than you started with which i guess is fine whatever, but when half the items in the pass are mediocre at best its like c'mon, why not let the passes earn like 500 moonstone more than you put in, it requires you to play the game to earn back your currency its a bit underwhelming though to just see your moonstones get lower and lower. Not to be that guy but battlebit got it right with supporter packs if you like the game and letting you earn everything else.

With all that out of the way I do genuinely enjoy the game, its a perfect blend of some of my favorite life sim games (AC, Stardew etc.) I just find it a bit scummy no matter how minor the quest may be.

I would recommend this game to friends but I would probably just tell them to by the ultimate edition on sale and save all the moonstones to spend on passes and any future quest they try selling. I want to emphasize this game doesn't push these purchases in your face and starts you off with some moonstone even, and i wouldn't want people to think this game is bad because it has a level of microtransactions, but it is an important thing to know for most gamers.",1689732408,1689732408,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've really tried to give this game a chance.  88 hours later the childhood nostalgia is still tugging at me, but the way Disney is using this game is disgusting. The more ""features"" that are released the less I want to play this game.  It's not about any kind of worthwhile storytelling or game play. It's another gross pick pocketing ploy from Disney execs. The Early Access system was created to help smaller studios eat and live because corporations like Disney, Microsoft, Nintendo, etc. hoard resources in the first place. It's gross that a company worth billions of dollars is taking advantage of this system. That they charge a big studio price for this game and then lock customization options and items behind a pay wall, after you've already paid for the game, is just more exploitation. These pay wall features are becoming more and more prevalent as updates are delivered, and I expect will become the main focus after they have tricked enough people into buying during ""early access"".  Let these poor game developers work on their own games instead of forcing them into indentured servitude for one of the most exploitative corporations in the world.  What a waste of 88 hours.

The character customization is excellent, and it has decent enough decorating.

It is in early access though, and deserves that label for now since there are plenty of bugs - but none that makes the game harder to recommend, they're mostly small annoyances that I hope they get sorted.

I never thought I would put 86 hours (and counting) into this, and honestly, it doesn't feel like I have.",1689368859,1689368859,True,19,2,0.666366755962371826,0,True,False,True

Edit:
Started out as a great concept and game, but after the last few updates it has gone down hill. A lot is locked behind paywalls, features we have been wanting are super expensive (Like House Skins). Even certain quest lines that are locked behind paywalls. This could be forgivable if it wasn't for the fact that it feels like all energy is going into the payed items not the items that are free.

I normally don´t buy and play games where there is a third party Disney Dreamlight Valley EULA involved  and even with a third account party Microsoft Playfab.

But this time I made an exception because the developer Gameloft are good guys and the Disney Dreamlight Valley EULA explained so many things in a good way that I trust them.
It seldom happens but it did in this case.^^

Now to the game!
You love animal crossing but was sad that you couldn´t move the houses of your animals or your own to the places you wanted, you like to meet Disney Character? Then you will love this game.

1. You can move tons of things! And even design your own clothing!
2. You can get tons of bags and books (left click on it and see what happens)
3. You can finally talk with your beloved disney character like Scar or E-Walle etc. (will be more over time)
4. There are events like Halloween with decorations and pets you can call them out or back.
(only outside of the house possible)
5. You can craft, farm, do Quest and find lots of mystical events that wait for you to solve.
And even work in a restaurant that will help improve friendship lvl!
6. Please remember that you can give each character Abilities so if you need sand or Loam what could it be you must do??? Spoiler: Random drop a certain ability. Later Storyline, you can buy it (random).
The same goes with the Algae sometimes you should fish on places without circles.^^ wink
7. For an easy start follow Merlins advice step by step and if you get a quest with:
""Leader shards"", interact with the npc only on open places no rooms no small way´s etc. okay?

You have to know that this game is in real time or better everyone has a daily routine.
The NPC you will meet have their own flow of the day, cute.
If it is daytime in real life it is there too^^ I find it very nice but for the one who work they can only enjoy daytime on weekends or holidays^^ Everything has a good side and a bad side.^^

As you can see you can do a lot of things!
But of course there is a limit, it is good for you, then you have to do a break.

You just have to buy the standard game, you will find lots of furniture, clothes, hairstyles etc over time.
You gain Moonstones throught seaching around and finding treasure Boxes.
If you have 2.500 Moonstars perfect for every Event that will come, you can gain more out of it through the Event´s if you are able to do all the quest.^^

But if you like the furniture in the bigger pack Luxus or the princess position in Ultimate edition and want to have more Moonstones for Halloween event, than of course buy it. Or like me you say developer you deserve it, good work thx.
What I try to say is, there is no real compulsion only a bit.

Please remember it is still early access so of course there are some bugs. And some area is of limit.
Please remember that you can play in your own way, if you want to grind than do it if you want to chill than do it^^

Thx at all the ppl who worked on this game, I and others too thought since years why does nobody make such a game. Now we finally have it.^
One thing I missed..., I hope it will come ""Emoticons for me to interact with my E-Walle"" I wanna wave at him.

Greetings a big fan.

Really fun - even though I'm not a huge Disney fan nowadays, I watched all the movies as a child, and let me tell you, this is cheaper than going to Disney Land. Good story progression, good farming grind, great cooking mechanics - OH, and the fact every single character who joins your game has real, lore-accurate motives and fleshed-out actual, reasons to be in your world, which is a detail I whole-heartedly appreciate - and the best part is, they're not robotically nice to you - they get angry and have REAL feelings.. I suppose some tiny complaints is just that I wish the story was more non-linear and you didn't have to kiss up to a certain NPC to prolong the story - and the fact the 'realms' you join aren't very three-dimensional - the fact the facial customization had a little more options, as I find some avatars look too much alike, unless you're heavy on clothes customization - then also, another small, insignificant thing (which doesn't take away from the gameplay, but I thought worth mentioning) would perhaps be that I wish the restaurant upgrade gave you more ingredients besides butter, eggs, milk, and cheese. But other than that, its really fun to grind - and its a great replacement for Animal Crossing: New Horizonz, since that game is done and dusted. I just really do wish they would add more interactive Disney characters, (I grew up in the early 2000's so) like from Monster's inc, or Hunchback of Notre dame (Quasimodo), and maybe Finding Nemo (maybe make them magical and flying), just to pay ode to the millennial fans.

Dont get me wrong Im not blaming the entire team. I am blaming whoever is making the bad decisions about their Premium Shop prices. This game was supposed to be an early access and open to the everyone to give their feedback in order to improve the game. Well 6000+ people signed a petition telling you that the prices are too much for the quality of items you are trying to sell. Every day people are telling you through Discord, twitter, reddit, etc and you choose to ignore this valuable feedback. Ignoring it will not solve the problem. Put your big pants on and address the issue your players that's all we are asking. Just say ""Hey so we are not lowering the prices because XYZ"" or what most of us are hoping for ""Thanks for your feedback we have considered adjusting the prices based on XYZ"" People will always be mad if you keep ignoring what could have been an excellent game. This game can still be saved if the monetization and quality issues are addressed. 

Time and time again people repeat the same thing. Please listen to the fans who care deeply about this game.  Since this game heavily relies on new content daily because it's a simulation game that means people will get bored and done with everything fast. 
As of right now it's a one and done for many because it's clear that there is no clarity on the true intentions behind what was originally stated in what is to be expected anymore. It does not hold up to it's own mission standards. 

When this game started it was in a good direction and I would have recommended and actually did recommend it to many people to play.

It saddens me because the experience it offers is nothing short of magical, filled with nostalgia that tugs at your heartstrings. From the stunning visuals to the tranquil gameplay, it possesses an undeniable charm.

The game's beauty is evident in every detail, immersing players in a world that feels like a tranquil escape from reality. Its peaceful nature is truly a breath of fresh air in the gaming landscape, allowing you to unwind and lose yourself in its enchanting atmosphere.

However, it is with a heavy heart that I must address the elephant in the room - the abundance of microtransactions. These transactions pervade the game to such an extent that they detract from the overall enjoyment. They create a lingering feeling of incompleteness, as if you can't fully explore and appreciate the game without resorting to them.

While microtransactions have become commonplace in the gaming industry, this game takes it to another level. They persistently beckon you, making you feel like you're missing out on significant aspects of the experience if you choose not to partake. It's a disheartening realization that can dampen the enjoyment and immersion that the game otherwise provides.

Additionally, the storyline of this game evokes a sense of Disney-like enchantment. However, it also inadvertently echoes a prevailing sentiment regarding Disney itself - that it has become an exclusive realm reserved for the elite. This unfortunate association takes away from the game's intended charm, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste.

In conclusion, despite its undeniable beauty and the nostalgic journey it offers, I regrettably cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game. The overpowering presence of microtransactions hinders the ability to fully explore and appreciate its wonders, and the unintentional parallel to Disney's exclusivity detracts from the intended enchantment. It is my hope that future updates or revisions address these concerns, allowing the true magic of the game to shine through for all players to enjoy.",1688669861,1688669861,False,12,1,0.574961543083190918,0,True,False,True

There are also so many other bugs that they haven't bothered to fix since release.

One of the most annoying bugs I've had to deal with (and many others) is the fact building doesn't even save your progress half the time. You could spend an hour building and then leave Build Mode only to find not only is everything you worked on, didn't happen, but some things are placed in weird locations you didn't even set them at all. 

Then there's the bug where items get randomly deleted that you placed in the world, forcing you to go rebuy them from the in-game store (if its an item that can even be re-ordered from the npc. If its a rare item that can't be, then you're just out of luck and have lost the item forever.)

Catching critters are locked at specific times of the day, poorly designed, because obviously there are going to be specific days/hours people cannot play EVER if they have a real life obligation. (But you can't change the time on your device to make up for this because that will permanently break your game so its unplayable). The least they could have done is make the critters locked at specific days instead of specific days AND specific hours so at least then the busy person could try and find a single window in that day to go get it.

There are many other bugs but these are the biggest ones I can remember off the top of my head so far.

Edit: Just remembered, the fences are glitched in-game so they always look broken/messed up on the edges. It seems to be random when the bug happens, but once it does happen the fence is broken like that forever. This makes using any fences just pointless unless you  are okay with the edges looking wonky.

I know people are going to say ""its early access, there will be bugs"". As an active sims 4 player, probably the most broken game in the world where EA hardly ever fixes ANYTHING.... And having come across bugs in this game that people were complaining about on release almost a year ago.... Yes, the game is buggy, but the bugs I've experienced most often are a very few. Meaning... what excuse is there to not have fixed those few bugs? I wouldn't have anything to complain about if those few bugs had been fixed when people first mentioned them LAST YEAR. For me, this is just a sign that Gameloft is exactly the same as EA. Here to scam players into buying their fake furniture while they never bother to fix any bugs except on the rare occassion.

Nothing about that makes the game sound worthy of being recommended....
The only reason the game is in Early Access is because people are still buying the game. And they already said it was going to become f2p once it was out of early access. They're just waiting on their sales to slow. Not actually spending Early Access fixing anything.",1688446366,1688447535,False,9,0,0.563000738620758057,0,True,False,True

I kinda thought it would just be some half-arsed cash grab (especially based on some of the reviews and because it's Disney), but what I got feels like a mixture between Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and The Sims. The game definitely isn't without its fair share of bugs which I really hope get fixed, but there's tons to do in the game and it just keeps you wanting to play more. The game is definitely designed in such a way that it's great for playing just 30-60 minutes a day, but you can play as much or as little as you want while still having things to do.

tl;dr of the following: the criticism over the paid content is overblown. It's all purely optional/cosmetic stuff and you can enjoy the game just about as much without it.

As for the ""Premium"" content in the game... Lots of the reviews I've seen complaining about it are utter bogus. Just because premium content exists doesn't mean you need to buy it. If an MMORPG has thousands of dollars worth of cosmetics in their cash shop, you're not expected to buy it all.... If anything, just buy the few things that stand out to you. This feels the same, although I'll admit the prices are a bit steep.

I haven't played enough to complete the Battle Pa- I mean, Star Path for this season but completing the Star Path (this game's version of a Battle Pass) makes back most of what you spend on it. It costs 2500 Moonstones to buy the Premium version of the Star Path which unlocks 20 extra items if you complete it, and it looks like you get 1910 Moonstones back after finishing. That means you only need to spend 590 Moonstones for 20 items by simply playing the game, and that's extremely reasonable imo for something that's only spent every couple of months. EVEN THEN, it's all ""Premium"" content that's unneeded to play/enjoy the game. You get extra objects to place or cosmetics to wear, and there's a ton that go on a rotation through Scrooge's shop.",1688206614,1688206614,True,10,3,0.583120822906494141,1,True,False,True

There are some things that could be changed to make it more enjoyable, but since this game is technically not finished and is in beta, I hope changes continue to be made.

All of that being said, I'm unsure about how I will view this game when it is fully released and becomes a free-to-play title. A problem I'm already seeing is a strange pricing system for the DLC. Though I haven't bought the Wall-E bundle that includes the new questlines, I can't justify the price they're asking for it. A new quest priced at about $20 seems very excessive. $20 should be the price of an expansion that has several quests and items included, not one questline that gives you essentially 3 new outfits. Personally, I can justify $5-$10, but any more of that is too much for too little content. I have no problem with adding DLC like cosmetic enhancements(outfits, furniture, etc) but the pricing structure needs to be figured out in order for anyone to truly feel like the money they spend on the extras is worth it.",1687986195,1687986195,True,1,0,0.508379876613616943,0,True,False,True

I loved Disney movies and cartoons as a child, but learned a lot of unpleasant things about the man and the company as I grew older. The company has also bought the rights to every franchise I was fond of as a child: Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar (well, they didn't come along until I was older). This bothers me. On the other hand, now I can watch even ancient shows like ""Young Indiana Jones"" on their website...

Okay, that's neither here nor there. The point is, this GAME turned out to be terrific! It has some of the elements I love from sim games: rebuilding a town that's been all but destroyed by some hidden evil, chasing down characters who left and convincing them to come back, and above all redemption for villains. I can't say much about the main villain without giving away the most compelling plot, but it's a great story arc and the resolution made me teary-eyed. 

Similarly, the game revived some of the love I used to have for Disney characters like Mickey, Donald, Goofy, etc., as well as allowing me to bring back characters I love from current films like Encanto, Wall-E, and Moana. The look and feel of the game is wonderful and music is beautiful, with many characters having theme music from their films. You have nearly complete freedom to decorate the valley as you like, including the ability to move houses around and change the paths and lights. There were some things I wasn't thrilled with, such as the fact that the time synchs with your timezone, whether you like it or not. This means someone who has a 3rd-shift schedule ends up playing at night in the game, most of the time, and characters are often asleep. (Thankfully, they don't always sleep at the same times.)

I was able to see the potential, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. Right now, it is in early access and a lot of people online have held up the early access status as some sort of shield that somehow makes this game immune to all criticism. 
Well, it might explain the many many bugs. That's the point of early access. There will be bugs. I understand.
BUT it absolutely does not make DDV a good game. There are issues, that will continue after the early acces period is over. And they will become apparent the longer you play the game.

PRO:
- It looks pretty? That one is down to personal taste. But they did manage to translate 2D characters into a 3D game without them looking weird, so I think they did great on that front.
- There is no storage limit of items (there is a limit to placed items, but not the storage).
- The main story can be played without spending more money
- Touch of magic tool let's you customize some clothes and furniture. This can be fun.

CON:
The game feels like a mobile game.
Some people might like mobile games. I like some of them, too. But just think of all the things that might bother you with mobile games and know that all of this will be present in DDV. All of it. 

This includes, but needs to be mentioned specifically: the horrific prices of the premium shop, with micro transactions that are beyond a rip off. Two backpacks, that your character can wear for 1500 Moonstones. (For context: the 1200 Moonstones bundle costs 4,99$ and you would still need 300 Moonstones more. For two backpacks.)

Want to have a kitchen that is inspired by Frozen? That is actually divided into three seperate bundles in the premium shop. All together it costs 3450 moonstones and it doesn't even include a sink or fridge. I imagine that will be in a future bundle. 

But even worse: Recently they introduced quests for Wall-E that you can pay for with moonstones. It costs 4000 Moonstones. The closest moonstone bundle to buy this is 5500 moonstones for 20$ so that makes this, what... around 15$ for a hollow feeling fetch quest, and some clothes (a dress/suit, a hat with feathers, a trashcan lid for your head - yes, really- and a shoe as decor.)?
15 Dollars. Let that sink in. At what point does it stop being a micro transaction and becomes a macro transaction?

The storylines are usually piecemeal. You get a sentence or two from an NPC, then you have to grind or do a fetch quest to get the next piece. Sometimes the game will force you to play at specific hours of the day and since the game is linked to real time, there is no way of circumventing this. Only able to play in the evening? Well too bad, you won't be able to progress the quest.

After you finished the main and character quests, the game is basically dead. You can grind for more materials if you want. Or you could try to decorate. But the way to get new furniture is luck based and you probably won't get enough for decorating to be fun. This might change after early access, but for now... most people stop playing shortly after an update cause there is nothing to do. 

There is more I could say. But this might give you an idea of what it is like. 
Please do yourself a favour and don't buy it in early access. Wait for it to be free to play later this year or maybe just skip it entirely and safe yourself a ton of money and a headache.",1687796644,1687796644,False,12,0,0.60555034875869751,0,True,False,True

It was a two month wait, but ultimately I feel it was worth it. I do know there are others quests that have similar bugs, so play cautiously. But the game truly is beautiful and worth the time and money I sunk into it.
============================================
I want to start off by stating that I am actually in love with this game and it hurts me to be giving it a negative review. I'm thankful that it's still in Early Access because it means these issues could still be fixed. Sooner rather than later, I hope.

I bought Disney Dreamlight Valley in December. I was excited because I'd seen so many of my friends posting screenshots of the game and it looked absolutely amazing. Immediately upon launching the game for the first time, I went wild exploring as many areas as I could unlock as fast as I could. Unfortunately for me, this meant I inevitably picked up and started crafting quest items before I had even received the quest they were for.

For those of you that haven't run into this issue yet, this is absolutely game breaking as there is no way other than restarting your game from the start to fix this issue at current time. The quest I did this with is not the only quest you can accidentally get hard stuck on, and again you have to completely restart the game from the beginning to fix it.

I have tried contacting Game Loft about this, I've checked the FAQ, I've searched online, I've even looked through the official Discord. It took a week to receive an email response from Game Loft after submitting a ticket that essentially boiled down to ""we're already aware of this problem"". This issue has been a known problem for months. 

Having Game Loft tell me in this email that fixing quest related issues is their top priority when they're in the middle of surveying for star path and premium shop content while game breaking bugs are ruining the experience for far more players than just myself feels like a slap in the face. 

I really hope Game Loft shows the community that they care about more than just their money before this game leaves Early Access.. I want to love and support this game, but I won't be recommending it to anyone until the story can actually be played without absolutely game ruining issues.

+ Fun and easy to follow story

Character customisation is okay, limited options, but that is normal for most games lately, especially with cut scenes.

Not a bad little game, gets boring after a while though, especially considering it runs on real time. I hate that.

There is now a petition, which gathered 5,000 signatures in the first two days.  GameLoft still remains silent.

Such a charming game and wonderful escape from real life but it's beginning to fray at the edges.  Scrooge's Shop just carries stuff you already own, the Star Path is a big disappointment, and the Premium Shop is ridiculously overpriced and somewhat insulting.  Sort of like they enticed us in but are now showing their true colours.  Very sad.  They are ignoring bugs and faulty game mechanics.  This game had such potential - too bad they have abandoned quality for greed.

To add insult to injury, they are deleting posts and banning posters who are criticising and complaining on their official Discord server.  Pathetic.

The store prices are (still) disgusting, and seems like the developers couldn't care less about listening any feedback/lowering prices; just had a check to see if anything had improved and it has not, so leaving my final review.

If you dare speak out against the store (or anything) on the official discord, the mods/community will try to silence and restrict conversation (I've seen mods deleting people's feedback on the premium store on a regular basis). Quite frankly the main discord is one of the worst, most heavily moderated, positively toxic communities I've ever been a part of. This wouldn't be a huge issue... except is the only place to provide EA feedback (which you cannot do properly because of the moderating/gatekeeping on said server).

Here is an imgur link showing posts from premium store feedback channel: https://i.imgur.com/MnuO0Pg.png
Bear in mind this is a few of the most recent 'deletion' posts (and there's a good chance that many people probably don't even realise their feedback is being deleted). The mods been doing this since the store opened back in February.

Highly suggest you avoid unless you're happy to throw £50+ into the store every week (though I still wouldn't bother as they seem to hate new players - all old star path items are perma removed and will never be available to you). If you do decide to give it a try avoid the main/official discord like the plague (join the dreamlight leaks discord instead).",1672481251,1687430157,False,32,0,0.678843557834625244,0,True,False,True

Gameloft lied. They introduced the Premium Shop in February, and despite the sky high pricing, they have neither acknowledged the complaints nor lowered their prices. They have, in fact, doubled down and made them worse.

Quest content is now paywalled. It was a side quest, but it was unbelievably expensive, and I have seen people say they regretted purchasing it.

DDLV is a cozy simulation and fetch quest game with Disney characters. Cosmetic items offered here are not comparable to games where those are not the focus of the gameplay (Fortnite, OW, etc.).

The official Discord is heavily policed, isolating all critical feedback to a Premium Shop thread that is completely ignored while also having mysterious ""blocked content"" that doesn't allow people to post regularly (slow mode channel with blocked content settings that forces you to wait six hours to attempt posting again if your original message was blocked).

While the game itself was charming and cozy to start with, Gameloft's true intentions showed with the Premium Shop, which, again, was not supposed to exist until the game released as f2p.

I thought this one may be similar, however, I find you have a lot more to do in this game particularly quest and friendship objectives, which I really like.

Most of us grew up with all or some of these characters, so I really enjoy when I get another character to move into my village (Donald has been a personal favourite). 

As far as game play it does have it's pros and cons. I love the story and the characters. I love foraging, fishing, and mining and once you have played for a while you start to figure out how to earn more money and find certain materials - Other players are also there to offer handy tips. My main couple of gripes are:
1. That you can't run faster! You can sprint (I believe this was in an update), HOWEVER, you need a gold energy bar to do it and it runs out extremely quickly. Also the 'sprinting' is more like cloud skating and...I just don't like it, I want to run
2. The food element of the game is very strange; I can eat 3 berries and have an almost full energy bar, but eat a 5 star meal which requires 5 ingredients and it will only fill up half my bar. Very odd. This doesn't encourage me to make meals so I just keep berries and bananas to hand
3.  I originally got this on the Switch which I really like because of the portability and control buttons. The landscaping is a NIGHTMARE, though, and I can say this is much better on PC as you can control the pointer more and menu accessibility is a lot quicker and smoother. The colours and textures are also so good on the PC (I didn't even know my mailbox was grey metal and Scrooge's shop looks amazing)
4. I would like to have more control options in game for the mouse and the ability to choose control buttons for the game. I tried via Steam to change my controller to Switch settings but it wasn't having it, so it would have been good to have this option in-game

Lastly, if you're still with me - and this is a good point - if you do play on two platforms you can use cloud save to keep both games updated, you just need to click the cloud save option each time you load the game on the other platform, but there is a pop up to remind you to do this.",1687344364,1687344364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is a simple, low challenge game.  Big draw is the Disney characters.  I have the same problems with it as noted below plus: 

The decorating in the land areas is basic with limited modification of placement and landscape.  Decorating furniture and clothing requires great patience as the tools for use are simplistic, hard to control and hard to see.  Desired game items (furniture, wallpaper, rugs, clothing) are hard to get.  These are sold at the store and there's a rating of rarity on each item.  After 8 months, there are still so many items I have only seen because other players have them.  As a player you have no control over getting the special items that are supposed to come with the game.  Players are needing to keep coming back just to see if they can get new items.  I get it a little but after 8 months I should have seen everything the game started with.  I haven't!  

Biggest issue is the developer is looking to make cash on this game from the original buyers and anyone who has started the game at anytime after.  Like the freemium games on mobile.  So this game is designed to be a real cash grabber,  That changes the viewpoint the developer has of the customer.  So the customer in this game is feeding the company and the company gives back just enough to keep the customer coming.  SO if you have low expectations for how you are treated as a customer or you have lots of money?  Pay on and play on!  For me, it's a lot of frustration.  There are so many other great games to enjoy.  Hope this is helpful.

Earlier review:
I’ve been playing for about a month now. Right now this game is overpriced.  People say it’s better than Animal Crossing.  Not so.  AC is a large open world with lots of characters, furnishings, clothes and options to landscape.  Dreamlight Valley is quite limited in all these.  It’s like a plastic toy with little spaces to plug things in and some limited items to plug.  It doesn’t take long to get to the end of options.  There are lots of glitches in players getting stuck in the plastic landscape.  The Disney characters have very limited dialogue.  It’s cute a few times around but then tiring.  The big plus is the Disney characters.  But even Mickey gets me when he keeps saying, “I’m so happy to have such good neighbors!”  Also there is no death and no pressure.  Depending on how you see that.  I’d say low value for the current price.",1669322646,1687296069,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

In-game currency costs an INSANE amount of IRL funds and every aspect of the game is NOT free to play. If you want the Wall-E quests, you have to pay around $20 (plus the initial cost of the game ahem I mean beta entry obviously) to get what turned out to be a boring quest line with ugly brown cosmetics as a ""reward"". If you have enough money (meaning more than average) to spend - then in all seriousness this IS a great game. It's addicting and really fun BUT I doubt I'll continue playing it if it keeps costing so much $ to keep up with. 

Food for thought:
- It's still a pay-to-enter beta and will eventually be ""free"" to play. Wait until it's free and try it out then! Save your money!
- There isn't a big amount of variety to choose from if you're looking to decorate the town or your house. I have enough stuff that I like to where I've decorated a couple of rooms in my house and that's it.
- There is no ""sprint"" in the game. There is a bonus you get from eating cooked meals and it is a VERY short lived bonus. So for the most part, you'll be walking around at an excruciatingly slow pace. Also I feel like it's worth saying that the ""sprint"" is more like you're riding some sort of skateboard? It feels very awkward and weird and like it doesn't belong and I honestly hate it. I would MUCH rather have had an always-available sprint button. BUT at least you can fast-travel via the map in the game's menu? On PC vs when I play on the Switch, this is a much more viable option (switch is wayyyyy too slow) and I use it quite a lot. 
- The best way to make money is to plant pumpkins. I'm thankful for that but at the same time planting and harvesting feels like a chore that I dread and avoid like crazy because of how slow and time consuming it is.
- The game glitches out a LOT (remember-it's a beta albeit a paid one) when anything prompts an in game overlay -> Meaning something pops up on the screen like...turning in items, quests, opening clothing or furniture bags off the ground etc. It also has a pretty annoying glitch where it will either not show villagers locations on the map at all, or it'll show them in their house which I will then enter, only to find that they're not home. I then walk outside of their house to find the villager standing directly in front of me.
 
All in all, I wish there was a gray area for this game's rating. Like in reality I'm more in between the thumbs up and the thumbs down than I am decided on one or the other but if I had to pick I'd say pass on it until you can try it out for free when it's (hopefully) more stable.

The positive:
A lot of content for an early access game. You get hooked quite early. This is definitively a great game for completionists - you will need to play hundreds of hours to complete the various collections, as I did. I have now completed everything there is to do in the game, including the June update content.

There is an incredible flexibility to move around everything in the game (buildings, trees, rocks, etc.), allowing you to create an environment to your liking. The variety in clothing and furniture that you can accumulate during the game (without having to pay extra for it) is good.  

The interactions of the Disney characters among themselves and the fact that they adapt to the configuration that you give to the environment make the game feel lively and favours immersion.

The negative:
Although this is an early access game, the developers/publishers have recently introduced content behind an expensive paywall, on top of charging a steep price for getting the game in the first place, On top, the regular offerings of cosmetics (clothing, furniture, environment improvements, etc.) are offered at very high prices, and you could end up paying various hundred of dollars to keep up with basic improvements (and more if you are in a less affluent country, such as where I live). The prices can easily reach $10-20 for a simple building skin, for example. And that in a game that still has a lot of bugs that have not been corrected since launch. 

Conclusion:
As I totally disagree with the cash shop philosophy of the game developers/publishers, I cannot recommend this game anymore. I don't think that we should support this kind of predatory behaviour. Too bad, as the basic game is very entertaining.

I'm not a big Disney fan, as in I watch the movies and I enjoy it but that's it. I bought this game because it's supposedly like ""Stardew Valley"" and ""Animal Crossing,"" which are 2 games I heavily enjoy and have a ton of hours in. The game is very simple, do certain tasks, befriend Disney characters, and save Dreamlight Valley. This game grindy for: resources (which most of the time refreshes after a few minutes), coins and dreamlight points if you want to unlock things right away, but I don't mind because I enjoy grinding games. Besides, it's nice and cute to have the Disney characters accompany you while you get tasks done (although I find it funny/creepy that they breathe down your neck while your fishing). Interacting with the characters is unique because you get to have these fun discussions daily. You can fully customize the Valley anyway you like. Oh! And the character customization is amazing. 

Like other reviews on here, I experience bugs and glitches, but what early access game doesn't have that? There are times when I would hand a quest item to a character, but the confirmation box stays on the screen even after handing the item; I end up having to restart the game often because of this, but no big deal. Or when I exit my inventory menu the camera does this weird thing where it pans out to a random area O.o

Overall, I enjoy this game a lot despite not being a diehard Disney fan. It's cute, easy to play and there are a ton of things to do (if you take your time with the game or even if you ""finish"" it).",1663455361,1687042774,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Living in your own decorated Valley and hangout with your favorite Disney characters.
It sounded so fun right, but is it really? 

I've bought the ultimate edition for 70,00€ which is the most expensive version of the game.
This version gives you many items and also 20,000 Moonstones which is in game currency. 
Moonstones is the currency that can bought with real money, or you can claim 50 moonstones a day when you login.
This game will go free2play and it was no secret that eventually after the game released we would get a premium shop so they would make money.
We also have a Starpath Battlepass which cost moonstones too. 
I'd like to quote what they have stated on their own website. 

[quote]Microtransactions will be limited and will focus on cosmetic items. Core gameplay mechanics will not be monetized, and the base game will not require additional purchases to be enjoyed as intended. After Early Access, we have plans to add paid expansions that will add significant content to the game, but this will not impact the original full game experience offered at launch.

Please note: At the start of Early Access, monetization mechanics will not be fully implemented. To ensure the game is meeting player expectations, we will leverage community feedback to implement these systems to ensure Disney Dreamlight Valley is polished and fun.[/quote]

Well, that's a effing lie now is it? 
They started with promises and made it seem like they were listening to the community and giving us gifts.
But slowly Gameloft is showing their true colors by creating content behind paywalls like the WALL-E quest and a premium shop with skins that cost around 15,00€ each which are crazy prices.
To buy all their content every week cost around 40-50€... So understand that if you want to collect everything the game will eventually cost you hundreds!!!!!
I don't mind spending a bit of money, but these prices for a singleplayer game are INSANEEEEE!!!!

On top of everything, they are breaking promises, for example organizing events that end on a certain date and suddenly they end it early while people were working so hard to enter the contest.
They also pretend you can win cool prizes but the last time we won a teapot which was copy paste resized item.
A summer event was coming where the rewards were 2 skins for 2 characters, people were so excited for this and as soon as they realized that they have put those in the premium shop too. 
Where is our Heroic Clothing Set? or our Walt Disney & Mickey Statue? Things that were promised with the Community challenge.

All they do right now is implement more and more ways to ask you for money while the game is in early access and buggy AF. 
Those bugs don't get patched fast, if there is a problem it will be fixed with the next update which is weeks later!
Everybody is complaining on Twitter and IG about it, but they aren't responding on any of it.

Essentially, your child will walk into a store, such as Scrooge McDuck's shop, and will see that there are items that have price tags so high that the only realistic way to get the money to afford that is to convert real-world currency to game currency through micro-transactions.

I really really wanted to leave a good review, but as it stands right now, I cannot - in good conscience - recommend this game to anyone. A) The price gouging is absolutely disgusting and ridiculous. I love a good in-game purchase, but this ain't it. They charge upwards and above $15 for a single character skin (one you may not even see around town), $9 for a tool set skin, and it's been observed they've charged similar or more for other ridiculous creations. It's absurd. B) THE OTHER KICKER, IS THEY ALLEGEDLY SAID THEY WOULD NOT DO THIS WHILE STILL IN EARLY ACCESS. ALSO, you get kicked out of the discord by the devs for even mentioning the price gouging, so you certainly can't ask about it. C) I'm getting so bored with the game because the quests are almost exact copycats from another character quest line, store items aren't as good OR the same ones cycle through too frequently (so why even spend the $9+?). It seems like they don't really know what they're doing or how to create better, more interesting content. So, if you don't care about being cared about by devs, etc; if you like monotonous, passive, repetitive playing; if you don't have to worry about money at all and like dumping it on in-game purchases, then you probably would enjoy this game. But if any of this resonates with you, and you like to also stick to bad devs, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.

On the surface, it's a charming game with potential, but the developers' relentless focus on squeezing money out of players through microtransactions has tarnished the experience.

One of the most frustrating aspects is the constant testing of players who paid to be testers themselves. Instead of genuinely valuing their input, it feels like the developers are using us as guinea pigs to determine just how much they can get away with charging for in-game content.

The pricing of certain items is simply outrageous. Charging $20 for small quests is downright excessive. These quests, while enjoyable, are not worth the steep price tag, leaving a sour taste in the mouth of those who expected fairer pricing.

To make matters worse, the inclusion of a Scrooge skin priced at $10 is a perfect example of how out of touch the developers are. This skin doesn't even contribute to the immersive experience as Scrooge remains confined indoors, completely detached from the magical valley. It's a clear cash grab, preying on players' nostalgia without providing any meaningful content.

Additionally, the star path rewards are heavily skewed towards motifs, which are predominantly useless in the grand scheme of gameplay. Obtaining 50% or more motifs as rewards feels like a slap in the face to dedicated players who invest time and effort into progressing.

Disney Dreamlight Valley had the potential to be a fantastic game, but its monetization strategies have severely compromised the enjoyment and value for money. The constant testing of players and exorbitant prices for trivial content, combined with underwhelming rewards, demonstrate a lack of respect for the player base. It's disheartening to witness such exploitative practices in what could have been a truly magical experience.

Please note that I have spent hundreds of hours playing Disney Dreamlight Valley, and my criticism stems from a genuine desire for the game to reach its full potential. While I have invested my time into the experience, it is essential to emphasize that being a dedicated player should not translate into being treated as a mere source of revenue.",1686775725,1686775890,False,31,0,0.684511482715606689,0,True,False,True

I knew when I bought the game it was early access, but what I didn't realize is that on top of the hefty price tag of the Founder's Pack the plan was to charge the living daylights out of me throughout this early access period. Now, they are locking gameplay behind a pretty significant paywall ($17 USD roughly). I would love to tell the developers that I feel this is much, much too far, but they aren't interested in their customers' opinions. Therefore, I feel I have no other option than to post this review.

Now, I know the plan is for this game to be f2p upon full release. However, even with that in mind, and comparing this game with others of its ilk, AND tacking on a premium because it's Disney, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game due to its predatory and cost prohibitive nature. The overall cost of everything is too high. Effective psychological manipulation (which, in itself is legal, honestly) pushes the desire for most of the assets in the game, with perhaps the exception of motifs; there are far too many of them and they even are forced upon you in order to advance on Star Paths. This game will definitely appeal to a younger audience-I introduced it to a young relative of mine and wish I hadn't. Now I'm going to have to try to explain to her why I have to embargo this game. I will not allow her to sink every last penny she gets her hands on into this game.

Please keep in mind this is coming from someone who owns ALL content from The Sims 4, so I'm not afraid to spend money on a game. The path this game is on, however, is more than a step too far in my opinion. The cost/value analysis is massively skewed here. Again, I KNOW the plan is for this to be a f2p game. However, even factoring in the aforementioned premium due to the Disney attachment, I feel that the cost is far too high for pretty pixels.

*UPDATE* I'm guessing the idea is to use Star Stable Online as a model here to draw as much coin from customers as possible. Horse games are a VERY niche market. Disney is not as much of a niche market. SSO is excessively predatory and I don't feel going after this model of gameplay is a good look for Disney.

This game is fun if you have the patience to grind the materials needed for crafting and farming. The story is good and can be engaging in some parts. But I can't in good conscience recommend the game after the latest update. The pricing for moonstones is now beyond ridiculous. $31 AUD for a house skin? As well the same price to access the new Dream Bundle for a few cosmetics and a character questline? Not to mention the moonstones needed if you don't have enough for the star path. I can understand Gameloft need to make revenue somewhere, micro-transactions are unfortunately a thing we need to deal with, but the cost of the currency is insane! It seriously needs to be lowered so that it is fairer for everyone to try and access these premium items, not just the whales.
There also needs to be some kind of material breakdown system put in place ASAP. Bordered paths are now in the game, but they in no way can be used with the existing/old paths. This means we now have to once again grind for the materials needed if we want to put down bordered paths, after already grinding for the paths we currently have. Either the new paths needs to connect to the current ones, or a breakdown system needs to be put in place where we get some of the mats back from the old paths we breakdown.
Hopefully these changes are looked at and put in place, but until then while I enjoy the game, the recent updates have left a sour taste in my mouth and I can't recommend it right now.",1686537136,1686537136,False,12,0,0.54798513650894165,0,True,False,True

If you are looking for a Disney Dress-Up Game, this might be the one for you. Just understand that there is a Premium Shop with purchasable cosmetics for very unbalanced prices. This game doesn't have much replayability outside of the free updates that add new quest lines and star paths. Once you have completed the content, you join the waiting bus for the next update launch with new quest lines and star paths. This recent update, they introduced a paid DLC for roughly $15 us that comes with a few questlines, 2 outfits, a Wall-E skin, and a furniture piece. I'm not looking forward to seeing how many more purchasable DLCs that they will be adding; with it being a Disney Game, it's possible that they could do one for each character. I've started to feel like they are trying to milk their player base and I'm not planning on dropping thousands of dollars for this Dress-Up Game which is really unrealistic.

When you pay for this game right now, you're buying the ability to beta test an eventually F2P game that originally had the promise that premium content would be granted as free access during this EA period if you paid in now. This is still stated on their website.

Recently they've began implementing grossly overpriced microtransactions for digital currency for premium items, and after the fanbase gave their feedback on how badly received this is, Gameloft doubled down and now have began locking quests behind a paywall. As it is now, the developers are picking and choosing what feedback is heard, and they're pushing further to see what more they can get away with. 

What is here is pretty alright, I've had very little issue on PC versus the performance disaster that is the Switch port. Granted, I've sunk a ton of hours on Switch until the constant crashes brought me to playing this exclusively on PC. That being said, I never spent more on this game other than the initial purchase and I don't plan to in the future.

Nostalgia
Easy to understand quests (mostly)
easy on the eyes

Cons - 
quest required items can spawn in unreachable locations (or sometimes not at all)

First of all: this game is a just released Early Access game, and there are a few bugs and unpolished visuals as to be expected. Be aware of this before you purchase! 

That said, as a Disney fan, I am finding this game amazing. I loved Stardew Valley and the mechanics in this are rather similar. And the idea to build my own world and populate it with beloved Disney characters is a dream come true. This is the game I always wished for as a child. 

The content that's there is definitely engaging and there's the promise of a lot more to come. Unfortunately, I only learned after buying the game that upon official release, it will be a game that's free for all. So I am hoping that after spending 50 EUR on it I will get at least some neat non-free DLCs or premium story content (something that goes beyond being merely aesthetic) out of it that can be purchased with the premium currency I got for free with my purchase. 

Overall, this game has a lot of promise. If they actually keep adding more and more characters to this, this will turn into an amazing game that has the potential to be an all-time favorite once eventually all the characters from the classical Disney movies will be available. I am particularly hoping for all the major characters and realms from the 1990s Disney Renaissance--Belle, Aladdin, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Esmeralda, Quasimodo and Mulan--because those are the beloved characters I grew up with. 

My worry is that as nowadays is so often the case with fremium games that keep adding content endlessly, that it will eventually remain unfinished or worse become unplayable if development stops. But that remains to be seen. For now, it looks like the studio and developers are very invested in it. You can feel the Disney love in every corner of the game.

So if you're a Disney fan, this game is for you. 

If you're not a Disney fan and game mechanics are your priority, you might be unhappy with this one. Gameplay is simple and essentially nothing new. The story is nice, but if you're not into Disney it might not appeal much to you.

UPDATE June 2023: One of my worries seems to be coming true, to as the game features more and more content behind paywalls that you have to unlock with premium currency (for which you have to pay real money). However, the vast majority of that content is cosmetic. With the latest update, we now got the first mission-content behind a paywall as well. It needs to be mentioned though that the rewards for those missions are also cosmetic and very character focused. Non of the content that you need to pay money for have to do with the main story or additional characters, all of which you still get for free. 

I have seen other reviews criticizing that, if you wanted all content, by now you would have to pay over 300 euros. However, realistically, only very few people will want all, if any, because it's such different styles. Most people will have their favorite style and characters and then might occasionally pay for that specific additional content. For example: the game offers several house skins for purchase. Only one of those appealed to me though. 

Another thing that I have to say is that the developers are very consistently releasing bug fixes and new updates with new free content. So I personally am more than willing to shell out 20-30 euros every few months for some (optional) cosmetics to support their work. That however, is a very individual preference. 
If you are unwilling to do that, then keep in mind that there will be cosmetic content in the game that you might like to have but will not be included in the price you paid for the game.",1663197690,1686402216,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

This game is extremely relaxing and the constant updates adding characters is really promising for the future development of this game. I would definitely recommend this game if like me you love animal crossing etc and disney! 

There are a few bugs and flaws throughout the game which clearly are not fun to deal with, but the game is still in early access.

Also, I cant help but notice the huge influx of reviews complaining about paywalls. These are all hugely over-dramatic reviews that are just not true! I have 57 hours in game at the moment and have not encountered a single paywall. The only things you have to pay for are exclusive cosmetics which is the current industry standard so in my opinion is nothing to complain about. The so called 'quests' that people are complaining about being behind the paywall are only to do with getting the new WALL-E cosmetic and have no impact on the main story. It seems unfair and incorrect to make such a fuss about having to pay for cosmetics when this is like I said the industry standard. None of the main story quests or characters are hidden behind paywalls and this does not seem like it is going to change. Infact, I didnt even notice the WALL-E quests until reading the flurry of negative reviews after the new update.

I knew Gameloft was primarily a free to play but ""pay2win"" company, but figured since they were putting this game up for sale, they may be delving into a different style. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. 
This game has been on offer to be PURCHASED for upwards of $70 US with the ability to purchase and use what they call moonstones in which you can purchase items and skins, as is the way with most free play games (noting that at this time, this isn't a free to play game and everyone playing this right now has PURCHASED IT, often for a HEFTY amount).
Slowly, they have increased the amount of items for sale + the purchase price for these items. They have now lowered the amount of moonstones per dollar and created short quest lines that cost $15 or more depending on which currency you're spending. Once again, a purchased game is literally charging people $15+ for a short little quest line while evangelists for Disney ""poo poo"" anyone daring to have a opinion on feeling gouged. 
Gameloft has already made their money back plus some just on the purchase price alone. These moonstone purchases are just gravy at this point. I'm not begrudging their offer of moonstones for purchases, the collective anger comes from the pure GREED of what they are charging for such little content after already spending money to buy the game.

Starting with, but not limited to, the constant crashing/freezing. PLEASE make this a top priority to be fixed.

Some of the quests are buggy, like with Donald Duck. he keeps running right into a blocked off section that can't be accessed and I can't guide him away from it. 

There's a bizarre visual glitch that occurs at times when you leave the menus, that sends the camera sailing around the map before snapping back to your character. 

Other then that this game is really fun. There's other minor bugs but nothing I can recall at the moment. 

I was gifted the money for this game by a close friend and I missed the log in date for the ice cream croc by 2 days. I didn't have the money to buy the game myself. So if a dev wants to take pity on my soul I'd love to get the croc. FOMO is a really disgusting practice by too many companies, and I'd prefer if this team wasn't like that. I'm not the only person.

I live on a fixed and heavily budgeted income. So I have to choose what I spend money on carefully. I don't think it's fair to punish people for that sort of thing with FOMO practices. One of the main reasons I was so eager to get this game at all was because of the Ice cream croc. And the fact that it trails konpeito around as it runs.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that several of the NPCs refuse to interact for quests that require them to interact. Poor Wall-E keeps going to the ocean's edge and twiddling his lil 'hands' waiting for Ariel BUT SHE WON'T LEAVE THE VALOR RIVER!!!

Can't get Elsa to register that we're in the cave together and exploring it, so there's a section I can't get to.

Ariel and Ursula are rarely in the ocean, instead they persist in staying to the rivers like this is a TLC song. -.-

---------

Edit 6/9/2023: The game is still fairly buggy. It continues to freeze and or crash here and there. The game will fully freeze, making me force close it. I literally have to open my task manager or close it from the taskbar if it let's me. 

The in game issues I'd previously faced with characters bugging out seems to have been taken care of so that's nice. The characters are fun to interact with. I'm hoping they add some of my most favorite disney characters like the Gargoyles, and Winnie-the-Pooh. I love Tigger and Piglet. Tiana and Jasmine, Peter Pan, Mulan, Snow White, Kuzco and Eeyore.

This is one of those games that normally sit in the dust until you are bored and wanted something different, and do note that there are way better casual games out there so the ""priority"" may be even lower than usual casual games we owned. 

Especially for Early Access games, some veterans tends to ""come back later"" for a more stable version of the game.

What you get here is a game filled with micro-transaction similar to those ""infamous"" Free to Play games out there.

Now I have played in my lifetime, every sort of high-end farming/crafting game of note. Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley etc, and I have a pretty solid idea on what I want in a modern game that advertises itself as something that fits along those sim categories. The closest resemblance this game has to any others, is probably Stardew Valley, but not in the ways you'd initially think.

To start off, if you are a huge (and I mean your wallpaper has hidden mickeys, huge) Disney fan, then this is a literal dream-come-true game. If you're here for a casual easy time, no end game, don't often play many games and wouldn't have an idea otherwise, then stop reading now, the game is utterly fine for you.

If however you're looking for something more in depth and you're looking for that next farming-sim fix or even a good pass-time game, then this might not yet scratch that itch.

Fundamentally, the game is still (even after multiple community surveys) missing some rather unforgivable QoL updates at this stage. I expected a lot more from Disney. They don't have the best repertoire of games, their studio for games has never been exactly anything special (I am discounting KH as that is just a SE game with a Disney IP). But, considering every piece of material and all the games of this nature that pre-date this by years, they're missing the mark entirely.
So at the time of writing, you can craft pre-made/design furniture. You can buy SOME basic essential blank furniture and throw a bit of pre-designed splash art on it to customise it. You can craft a type of path, a type of fence, and you can cook. You can craft enchantments, that you will never use as your tools are all one-hit-wonders anyway and it's a waste of resource. You can collect materials, and finally you can farm. 
 
You cannot Batch Cook. You have to find and either manually add or ""Auto-add"" set ingredients. Cook. Wait for the animation. Hooray.- It's tedious. Almost every villager will have 2/3 cooking quests as well. (Food is also a source of increased running speed and the new air surf feature. It consumes it almost instantly, it's faster to just teleport.)

You can't store efficiently. It uses a chest based system where you will need at least 30 small chests, about 20 medium chests, or several large ones either in one chest room or scattered around your village. Most quests allow you to craft/use materials that are in your chests already when you get to a crafting station. Some quests require you to have the materials on hand in your inventory to deliver them or carry them to a crafting station (Even though you craft FROM your chests as a resource? It's stupid.) - If you have mismanaged your materials up until those points, I wish you all the luck in the world in either finding what chest in high tide you've put it in, or with re-gathering them.

Placement of items, furniture, paths etc is all blocked by the never-ending spawning of materials, usually ones you have x1000 of like Basil. In the placement mode you have access to your entire map, but if so much as a sprigg of ginger has spawned, you need to manually go over there and pick it up before trying again to place the item, which is also notorious because:

Your menu resets to the top. - Scrolled down for ages trying to find something that wasn't in the category you thought it was? Wondered why the ""All"" tab on food makes it so nothing is alphabetised? You will eventually find it, then if you go to find it again, more often than not your menu has flicked back to the top of options and you need to essentially doom-scroll down again until you find what you were looking for. It just wastes time. There's no type search feature.

Farming: You will only ever farm your basic veg needs until you have 50 of every item, then unless you intend to use it purely for display, you will only ever grow and farm pumpkins which are unlocked in the last zone. Pumpkins are the highest produce to sell and the best and easiest way to make money. I've been sat on 5mil for the better part of 6 months. Never farmed since unless a quest specifically told me to.

Scrooge's Shop: You might find one new item a week. You can't sell anything you have duplicates of. You will get a lot of basic furniture sold here too, stuff that comes with the base game like ""Red Couch."" ""Basic Grey Counter."" ""The same portrait of Micky you've seen 60 times."" 

Going back to talk about placement, let me be broadly frank, you are far more limited than you think.
So unlike Animal Crossing for example, which is entirely shape-able by the terrain tools in it's hills, water, etc. When I compare this game to Stardew, I mean that your farm/village has a fixed shape. You can't alter walls, biomes, rivers, ponds, or any sort of environmental placement. Because of this, I have often been trying to work around places and shapes that unnaturally fit, and pathways don't curve and can't be placed on slopes. I'm finding I have say, 20 squares made up exactly how I want them, nice furniture placement, maybe a hedge or fence. Then the surrounding area will look a total mess and frustrate me that I can't even finish a path (and then basil will spawn.)
This being said, you ARE given the entire map to work with despite having to have the villagers homes in somewhere. If I could give any new player advice, it would be to entirely strip your island, keep all the villagers in one place until you reach a point (I'd argue around the pridelands stage) where you can start comfortably having control of your map placement, and not get too excited to start building and customising your village until you're done with a SOLID margin of the game at this stage.

The economy:
So 134 hours in. I am STILL short on some resources, specifically gems which are a rare drop chance when you need very specific ones.
The economy on important resources outside of sticks, is ludicrous. Paths are completely written off, you will not have enough stone for a nice brick set of pathways because when the valley is divided up into squares, each square is pretty tiny and that's a single piece of path each. Animal crossing and Stardew are both forgiving in this. But this map is HUGE on a different scale. To make up for everything the villagers need, you're going to have to sacrifice your own wants and wishes for customisation.

Gathering is easy for basic necessities, but it's not the function, it's the time. You can get Kristoffs shop (Which will save you a good 2/3 hours of time) when he has things like Iron Bars in stock. But the drop rate on Iron Ore is low, you could be mining for hours and end up with 50 pieces or 5 pieces. You could argue that yes, this is the entire purpose of the game. Gather resources for 3 hours - do villager quest - rinse and repeat. But it's sadly unimaginative, tedious, and has even brought me to some points where I resent certain characters. Ursula and Airel will literally fly around the map.
The entire point of this game to me, feels like to waste time. You can interpret that as a good or bad thing.It's not designed to be completed, but to get to a space where I feel ready to feel like I can safely use my resources and breathe a little customisation into my valley, I instantly need all the resources again I've just spent. Crafts are COSTLY. Horde everything, use it efficiently and wisely or not at all for a time.

This game still uses in-game purchases and I won't even elaborate, stop normalising this. It's a bad practise. Don't buy from the store, it's like the Skyrim horse armour. Though the Event Path isnt too bad, you'll have the leftover stones already for that each time. It does however, only make me do basic activities when I have the rewards available for simply playing.",1686210178,1686210178,False,16,1,0.543199896812438965,0,True,False,True

I got this asap knowing it was early access and that there'd be bugs and issues to report. I was really looking for that Animal Crossing itch.

Story reminds me of Never Ending Story movie.
Play is very basic, easy.

There is hardly any audio for characters you meet. You have to continually read what the Disney characters say. Imagine watching a Disney movie with the characters not speaking and you have to read what they say. How cheap and disappointing.
But, my granddaughter loves Disney, so I can't return it. And I hope Disney may fix/ improve it soon (then I can do a happier review).

....Now my granddaughter and I have played for an additional 14hrs (over approx 6 months).
I still do not recommend the game. The characters still have hardly any audio. You have to read (and read and read and read) what they are saying. This makes the game so boring, my granddaughter loses interest quickly.

However its gameplay loop is somewhat repetitive so for players not looking for something to do on a routine daily dont pick this up XD",1685849503,1685849503,True,1,0,0.516083300113677979,0,True,False,True

Its story rich with quests and objectives. You can garden, harvest, fish, mine rocks and gems, cook, craft and so much more. One of my favorite things to do is being able to decorate my house and village. You can fully customize the village making it yours truly.

There are a few characters who will automatically start out at the village with you. Be sure to talk with them. Each character will have 3 favorite gifts they will ask for per day. These favorite gifts they're in search of will change every day. Giving them these particular gifts will give more exp and boost your friendship with them faster. However, giving them normal gifts will also boost friendship but at a slower pace. I also trade stacks of flowers to villagers to boost our friendship without performing any tasks with them. Level 10 is currently the max friendship for friends. As level 40 is currently the max level for players. When you do tasks be sure to ask a friend to hang out with you. Not only does it help boost friendship with them but if you've chosen a task they're assigned to help with they double your items from fishing, mining, gardening, etc depending on which task you've assigned them to do.

There are several raspberry bushes and apple trees around the village. When you see them be sure to harvest them. Raspberries will replenish harvest in 17 minutes; while apple trees replenish harvest in 20 minutes time. I regrouped my raspberry bushes and apple trees so I could have them together. Not only does it make your village look more elegant looking over time; it also saves time of running around your village in search of your fruit trees and bushes. Overtime I gathered up all of the fruit trees and bushes and made a little orchard. Now its much easier and quicker for me to gather fruit.

Harvesting fruits from trees and bushes does not take away your stamina. The same goes for picking flowers and/or vegetables. When starting out I always kept several stacks of fruit on my character at all time. Eating fruit replenishes your stamina. However, once you're able I recommend making fruit salad and keeping them on hand. There are different ways you can make fruit salad. Depending on which fruit salad recipe you chose determines how much stamina you will be granted. Be sure to make the fruit salad which requires only 3 gooseberries once you're able to make it. You may need to eat 2 of these for max stamina depending on how low your stamina is prior to eating the ""gooseberry"" fruit salad. This particular fruit salad is also used by endgame players. It is a relatively cheap meal to make but an effective way to get full stamina (yellow gauge stamina; which also allows you to glide through town and move more quickly). Yellow stamina naturally allows you to move quicker, which doesn't use up any stamina. Gliding however does eat away at your stamina and rather quickly. As long as your stamina gauge remains yellow you will have quickened movement. Once the yellow stamina gauge runs out it will return back to the regular blue stamina gauge. Your movement will also return back to normal speeds.

Overtime you will be able to upgrade your inventory. I recommend upgrading your inventory and Goofy's stalls as soon as possible. There are so many things that will need to be upgraded overtime. Money is your friend. A good way to make money is by harvesting fruits and vegetables and making meals with them. Sell the meals you make to Goofy. Meals are typically the best way to make money early on. If you are not able to make meals you can also sell fish, vegetables and fruits to Goofy. However, you won't make as much money if they're uncooked and raw. Once you have access to pumpkin seeds I recommended buying up as many as you can. Starting out pumpkin seeds are a bit on the pricey side. They're 275 Star Coins per seed. But once you start growing them, you'll make back over double what you paid to plant them. So it'll be worth it in the end. I chose to grow my pumpkins in Sunlit Plateau because of the aesthetics. You will get 664 Star Coins per pumpkin you sell to Goofy. Be sure to bring along a character who's trait is set for harvesting crops along with you. That way you can double your yield. In that case, it would technically be 1,328 Star Coins per harvest. Pumpkins will take 4 hours to fully grow. You have to water them twice. Once after the initial planting and then once more at the 2 hour mark. They must be watered in order to be ready within the 4 hour mark otherwise they make take longer to grow. Also, if you notice the clouds are darkening in game, that is a great time to start planting seeds. There's a good chance it will rain. When it rains, that counts as watering your flowers. And that would save you time, stamina, and food.",1664075899,1685847785,True,4,0,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,True

Decorating is fun and there is a pretty good variety of items, but I would like a little more depth to it, like color/pattern customization or using more than 90 degree angles. Clothing options are still very lacking in my opinion but it's still in early access so I'll cut it some slack.

If you're a Disney fan, you will be pleased. I feel all the dialogue is true to the characters in how they act, their motivations and their quirks. I think it's really good! There are strong themes of friendship, connection, and reconnection that are very on-brand and wholesome. Honestly it warms my heart just to have Simba following me around, and sometimes I do just have the urge to take a selfie with him, or go say hi to Elsa when I see her walking by, even if I really have no reason to.

But, to my surprise, the game isn't all sunshine and magic. There are some mature themes too, like loneliness and self-doubt, that are central to the story. It is definitely still kid-friendly, but some of the scenes are honestly a little unnerving even from an adult's perspective. It was a pleasant surprise for me, and I really did enjoy discovering the secrets behind Dreamlight Valley.

Problem with Disney Dreamlight Valley, is they got a ingame currency, called Moonstone, you get for buying the game, They have something called a Starpath there is basically the same as a Battlepass, it cost Moonstones to be able to access the whole Starpath. 

I got the game on Steam and Nintendo Switch, both Ultimate and you get 20.000 Moonstone for each Ultimate (It are a Crossplay / Crossprogress game), the costumer service claim that Moonstone not can merge from others platforms, wish is fine. But when I should pay Moonstone on my Nintendo Switch, it took my Moonstone from Steam too, basic pay for them 2 times. Costumer service will not help. I had lost alot of Moonstones around 16.000. is a lot of money going to waste, it seems like the one of my Ultimate Moonstones is just gone, to buy new Moonstone is cost 49.99 euro for 20.000. 

The next problem with this game is, when there is a issue or a game bug, they dont fix it, there not only weeks about it, but months, so they rarely come out with bugfixes, because they wait several months if not more before they send out a update to fix it. They just collect bugs and wait to there coming a new game update out, in the meantime, a lot of people is stuck in their questlines, and you can see on social media how they talk about, now part 3 of this questline is open, but many can not move on, because of this bug and have to wait. 

Yeah I know, it are early access game, I had played a lot of early access games and I am beta tester on a lot of games too. Bugs normal getting fix in for 7 - 14 days. 

I really looking forward to this game and it have a huge potential and you can see there is going to happen a lot of things with the time, where there will be open for new content.

- Gardening
- Cooking
- Crafting
- Decorating
- Exploring
- Completing tasks/quests.

I love the cooking mechanic because you can literally throw whatever you want into the pot and there's no way to go wrong -- you'll always make SOMETHING, and you'll either discover a new recipe or a new way to make something you already have the recipe for. 
There's a LOT of content so far even though the game is still being updated regularly with more content. I'm nearly 130 hours in and have only now caught up with almost all of the quest lines. 

I do have a couple of suggestions that would make the game better, if the devs are listening:


- Being able to track item crafting. If I'm trying to craft something and it has 6 components with specific amounts, I'm typically running back to the crafting station periodically to check what I need and how much. If I could track these elements similarly to a quest, it would make things so much easier.

- This one isn't really a mechanic improvement but I wish we could order things we see in villagers' houses that we want. I would love the laundry machine set from Stitch's house but there's no telling if or when it'll ever show up in scrooge's shop. I would really love a catalog for this but I understand if there's some reason we can't have that.

The only REAL complaint I have is time-locked quests -- I work grave shift and go to sleep around 9 in the morning, so getting the mid-day items (such as the sunstone fragment) took me almost 3 months because I simply just was never awake at that specific time.

And that's my two cents! Overall it's a very fun game. There's been little hints here and there to the storyline and I can't wait for more of that to unlock.",1685009630,1685027516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking; they flawlessly encapsulate the magical essence of Disney. From the glowing fairy lights to the meticulously designed Disney characters, each graphic detail is a tribute to the imaginative world of Disney.

Moreover, Dreamlight Valley does an impressive job with character drops and missions. You can choose from an array of familiar Disney faces to guide through the game. The character drops are randomly placed throughout the game to keep you on your toes. The anticipation of who you might stumble upon next adds an exciting layer to the gameplay.

In terms of missions, they are just as creative as you would expect from a Disney game. Each mission is a small story in itself, sometimes drawing from beloved Disney tales and at other times crafting new narratives. They are filled with puzzles and quests, rewarding players with unique items and character upgrades, ensuring that the game never feels repetitive or dull.

Playability and engagement are where Disney Dreamlight Valley truly shines. The game controls are intuitive and easy to grasp, making it suitable for all ages. The difficulty curve is well designed, gently increasing the complexity of tasks to keep players challenged without overwhelming them.

The one thing that Disney Dreamlight Valley could benefit from is the addition of a multiplayer option. Considering the vast game world and the various characters, having the ability to play with friends or family would significantly enhance the overall experience. Whether it's teaming up for more complex missions or simply enjoying the Dreamlight Valley world together, multiplayer could open up a whole new dimension of fun and engagement in this game.",1685000427,1685000427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Now unless you plan to never have a system failure and relay on solely one machine, I would steer you away from this game if you care about progress and item exclusives. 

This was my review at first.
Disney Dreamlight Valley has been a great nostalgic journey for me and has been very entertaining. I love that you get to experience an adventure with some of your favorite stars from Disney and cannot wait to enjoy future stars additions.

The complaints with regards to in-game purchases are pretty overblown. I have already completed almost all of the quests and participated in SOME events and it has cost me nothing more than the base-game purchase. You only have to spend money if you WANT to. 

My biggest complaint though is the lack of classic Disney movie characters. I bought this because as a kid I loved Disney movies and as I grew older I stopped watching new Disney releases. Aside from Mickey and those types of classic characters, most of the Disney characters are from the newer movies. I haven't seen Moana, Frozen, Encanto, Tangled... So I can't connect well with these characters and don't have the knowledge to easily understand who they are. So in essence, I am only familiar with about half of the characters.  
I would love it if more of the characters from my childhood favourites (Robin Hood, Pocahontas, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty) started to appear in the village or game as interactable characters.

When I submitted the ticket all I got after more than TWO WEEKS was ""we are aware of the issue and are working on it"". Well, that's fair, what else can I want? Im missing out on events so maybe some compensation when the issue would be fixed, wouldn't you agree? I mean, it wasn't my fault I was unable to participate. So I replied to the ticket, asking that question. What I got was more ""we are aware of this"" and ""team is working on it"". I gave up after two attempts. 

It's 6th of April. There was another content update yesterday, meaning I missed an entire event, with no word about the issue. I still can't connect to the servers, I tried all the solutions I found online, then few more I came up with myself - from digging through logs, up to port forwarding and disabling firewall on router. Nothing. Are they working on the fix? I doubt it, it's not even listed on their list of know issues:

Curses and madness be upon you, gameloft

Update 2023.05.17:
I have missed at least 1.5 events. I am missing rewards which I might have earned if it weren't for game-side bug. One could argue that since it was their fault, I should get some sort of compensation, right? After few messages to gameloft support (all of which asked about compensation prospects when the bug is finished), I had to resort to asking in all caps ""DUE TO CONNECTION ERROR, I MISSED AN ENTIRE SEASON, SOON-TO-BE TWO SEASONS WORTH OF LIMITED CONTENT. ARE THERE ANY PLANS FOR COMPENSATION SINCE I MISSED THEM DUE TO AN ERROR ON YOUR SIDE"" for support agent to acknowledge the main subject of my question (so far I all I got were different variants of ""we are aware of the issue and are working on it"", even though i described the bug only as a base for compensation part). The answer was: ""Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with any compensation in this case, as we have a very strict compensation policy.""

I even left a great review comparing it to the likes of Sims and Stardew Valley. (You can find that review at the bottom of the post.) However, I would like to now take this back.

Your interactions with the characters are entirely superficial. It DOES NOT matter what you say to them, they will always respond to you positively. There is no way for them to be upset with you or for them to dislike your answer, meaning that their personalities have no dimension. EVERY quest in the game is a fetch quest with no diversity. It's just ""Hello! I am a character, please bring me this so I can xyz."" ""Wow, thanks for the thing! Can you bring me this now?"" 

And that is the entire game. 

I played it for about a month when it came out and now have no desire to go back. There are many games that do this concept so much better. It's not even worth the characters looking like Disney characters when they don't even have their personalities and emotions. You have some of the best characters in media and you failed to capitalize on them. It's a shame.


MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:
This game is Disney's take on Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, and a little bit of Sims. The characters have schedules and go different places throughout the day. It does follow a real time system like Animal Crossing. Unlike animal crossing, you do not have to wait very long for different activities and things to grow which I really enjoy. If you want to play and just grind for hours there is nothing stopping you from doing that. I really enjoy being able to decorate the entire town and move houses as I please. It makes the whole valley feel more open to you rather than other games that only let you decorate at your home.

The gameplay and graphics remind me very much of an MMO that I used to love called Freerealms. The graphics are mystical but not overdone, and some of the clothing items are very cute. A tiny detail that I absolutely LOVE is that there are certain mickey ears and loungefly backpacks in the game are actual products you can by in real life. It makes me want to collect them all even more! I would love if they created a feature that let me display my backpacks and my ears in my house.

The game has it's fair share of bugs, but that is to be expected while it's in beta. At my nearly 60 hours I have almost completed every quest available in the game. Just as I was about to, the new update was released! Even still, there are many clothing items and furniture items I have yet to collect.

RECOMMENDATION: This game would be perfect if it had Steam Achievements. Give me some crazy goals to work towards! I love when games have a variety of achievements from ""complete during normal gameplay"" to ""I must play this game for a hundred hours to have a CHANCE at getting that.""",1666220538,1684276563,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

When I first got this game in late December, I fell in love with it. But now five months later its design flaws have begun to show, and now I've reached a point where I barely log in for two minutes to check Scrooge's shop.

Gameplay:
[list]
    [*] Quest items can spawn in and nuke your landscaping (e.g. the alien dolls from Buzz's quest).
    [*] The game freezes when editing biodomes if you remove or place enough items.
    [*] The autosave feature is ass, so any freezing resets parts of your progress and throws items randomly around the space you edited.
    [*] Mine and a friend's beaches are taken up by a long conga line of 35+ junk items that spawned in. I assume this is because they spawned in the sea and the game just flopped them down on the nearest interactable spot.
    [*] Unlike spawning junk, furniture and clothing surprise bags can land out of bounds. They remain there for rest of your save file, so... surprise!
    [*] When doing any gathering, mining, or gardening, your companion character will just chuck anything they find wherever they feel like, preferably in a spot you've already left.
    [*] They can also block a doorway, leaving your character in a limbo and forcing a restart.
    [*] Sometimes characters lose their map icon, meaning you need to comb through the valley to find them.
    [*] Ursula and Ariel don't give a fuck if you need to talk to them.
[/list]

Scrooge's store:
[list]
    [*] Basic ""catalogue"" items show up as showcase items, often taking up half of the space with their various recolors.
    [*] Not all Scrooge's store items were created equal; some will repeat with a much higher likelihood. Especially if from the basic catalogue.
    [*] It's possible to never see some items, despite logging in for months to an end.
    [*] With each store update something new is released that can't even be interacted with (currently a waterfall, before that a candle). Excited to see a new item after months of the same L-shaped couches and countertops? Get out of here.
[/list]

Cash shop:
[list]
    [*] Items can't be inspected before buying. You get one lousy little picture.
    [*] Some preview pictures don't even show all items in the bundle.
    [*] Most cash shop items aren't unique as meshes, and buying them won't give any recolors either, unless a different pack gets released and you purchase it.
    [*] Cash shop only has four slots. What you see is what you get for a week or more.
    [*] Save for house meshes, cash shop items tend to lean more towards realism than fun. While I'm definitely not speaking for everyone, I'd want more whimsy and magic than boring-ass H&M wrap skirts and plastic watches.
[/list]


General grindiness even if you spend real money:
[list]
    [*] Event duties have become more and more time-consuming each event, encouraging real money use.
    [*] Crafting-related quests will ask you to gather a ridiculous amount of ingredients. No, you can't pay-to-win.
    [*] Some time-gated quests take days to complete for the main story.
    [*] Character-centric plots feel same-y (Mickey looking for Minnie, Ariel looking for Eric, Kristoff looking for Anna...).
    [*] Writing can vary from great (Scar, Remy, even Mickey) to some of the most one-note, lifeless interpretation possible (Moana).

The negative elements at launch have a left a lingering bad taste in my mouth, but obviously there is something good about this game or I wouldn't still be playing it, so, let's start again shall we?

The Good
* All your favorite Disney characters!
* Relaxing casual gameplay

Neutral
* The cash shop - I've personally been underwhelmed by most of the offerings thus far, but I think it has a lot of potential. 
* In Game Events - Grindy gameplay, but gives you goals to work towards. 

Cons
* The characters are kind of bland. A few have interesting enough personalities that the writers can think outside the box a bit (I love Stitch!), but most of them are pretty one note. Moana loves the ocean...and not much else. Did you know Remy likes to cook? And so on.
* Object Count in world - in Animal Crossing I really felt like I could decorate every corner of my island to my satisfaction. Due to performance and I'm sure cross platform shenanigans you're fairly limited in Dreamlight Valley. Pick the 1-3 areas you like best and just leave the others empty.
* Lots of Useless in game rewards - motifs, picture pieces, even coins...all of these are pretty useless.

It's Animal Crossing with Disney characters... but I would argue that it's better. 
The biggest improvement from Animal Crossing for me is the building tools this game has. Way way better controls, easier to place/move stuff and the 3D camera offers a lot of flexibility compared to AC's fixed camera. The only thing missing would be landscaping tools but there are multiple different biomes available all with their own theme which gives enough variety compared to having to make it yourself in Animal Crossing. 
You can also place stuff both inside and outside in a Sims style god mode way instead of having to carry and place everything manually like in Animal Crossing. 
 If you don't like where a character's house is... just move it! 
No need to wait a day or cheat the game by changing your system timer to the next day. 
The game constantly gives you objectives and tasks to collect currencies to unlock new areas or unlock stuff from the Battlepass system. 
I do agree that the in-store items are a bit pricey... but it won't stop you from progressing or gatekeep you in anyway. They are purely cosmetic and there are already hundreds of furniture you can buy for in-game currency. 

Final thoughts, if you love Animal Crossing but the building limitations get you frustrated then you will love Dreamlight Valley. 

(keep in mind that I bought this game 1 year after it's Early Access release and a few months before it's Free to Play release. My opinions might be different from players who were playing this game from Day 1 on Early Access).

The quest mechanics are pretty simple which is to be expected since the developers wanted to make sure the game is playable for people of all ages.  I've seen many reviews where people list their pros v cons, so I will do that here.

Pro:
--The graphics are pretty good. Every Disney character you unlock for your valley will look and act the way you would expect them to.  Especially if you're a Donald Duck fan.  Everytime he goes into a temper tantrum, I just smile because it's so funny.  And it's adorable to hear Minnie say, ""Remember I love you!
--As mentioned above, the quests you do to unlock characters and things is pretty simple.  This is great for those who are looking for a relaxing game with little thought required.
--You don't just interact with adorable Disney characters, there is stuff for your creative minds to do as well.  Aside from having nearly total controle over where you place buildings and items, there is also customization in the form of a wardrobe creator.  I'm not that artistic, but I've seen so many beautiful items that others have created.

Cons:
-- After a few hours of play, you may become annoyed with your villagers.  There's only so many times you want to hear Maui get in your face and say, ""Hey, it's your favorite demigod!""  or Ariel say, ""One of these days, I hope I can be a part of YOUR world.""
-- Although most of the main quests are easy to complete, there are some quests that you will not be able to figure out without checking social media or the internet.  If you don't have a PC and no access to the internet, then there will be things you will be unable to do because there is no instuctions on certain quests in the game.",1683646211,1683646211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

my overall experience playing the actually game, well I've enjoyed all the hours I've put into it tbh, I love building, decorating, crafting and occasional digging for nice treasures.
Yes there is a shop with currency ""Moonstones"" but I do not see this game to be a P2W game as the items you could purchase are purely cosmetic and down to the individual if you do or do not buy Moonstones, 
The Characters are amusing to say the least, intrigued to see who else they bring into the valley.

We have just finished our 1st community challenge, the rewards from that was not to great, as the community as a whole expected a little something different for the big prize. 

Overall:
Looking forward to future updates for this game as its the most chill game I've played in ages. 


The Social Side Aspect
However their way of managing their Social is rather Diabolical in my option avoid joining their discord unless you want to face unfairness and favouritism towards curtain members of their Discord, and also don't ask any questions about there's reasons and or methods behind some of their comments they don't like this.

I will mention also I avoided using mod mail after my first experience with this as whomever I spoke the through that service gave a Impression of favouritism towards the person who targeted me in the first place. ( through discord on their social as I think it will be abit bias, due to seeing favouritism within this server towards curtain people) so I reached out abit further, 

I was not expecting or had any hopes in regards to getting a response, However I was surely shocked to receive a response from a Gameloft GL, I explained what has happened and left it in their hands. So Props to that

Since then I have been noticing very small chances, in terms of a ""pinned message"". I've have had 2 encounters with the same person who has clear Bulling Technique and this same person has targeted me twice in last 2 days.

The first time was when I was trying to help someone and also get ideas on food for energy return.
And the second time I was trying to raise someone spirts in terms of finding items,  she then spotlighted me again just to correct a spelling error to that I say well done yes I sometimes spell my words with errors in them and thanks for bringing that to everyone attention.

So from the above experience's, I have now blocked and reported that person to Discord, as I'm not there to be targeted nor Bulled, I play this game because I enjoy it.

Why I keep playing the game even after I gave this review, I keep playing because this game enjoy I played for it, and personality I'm not going to let some random person destroy my enjoyment.
I will continue to try and help people if and where I can. as far as my contribution in Discord I'm going to keep that to a very minimum basis, even with that my eyes are wide open to the inequality within this discord server",1669221972,1683346218,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Overall, I enjoy and recommend this game. However I could spend my review gushing about the good, or prepping you for what's still needing improvement so you can choose to play or not accordingly. 
It can not be understated the infuriating aspects of the game. Materials that you normally obtain with ease will suddenly vanish when you need them for a task or challenge. Prepare to spend literal hours grinding for materials, yelling at your gaming platform, and threatening to throw your controller or keyboard out the window while trying to obtain what would otherwise be easily located materials. 
This game is still in Beta as I write the review, and can only hope they'll continue to listen to their games' audience and adjust the game as necessary; which, to their credit, they seem to do with semi-regularity. 
As of now, you are unable to choose which characters populate your valley, as they are all required and are starting to crowd the space. 
The most frustrating aspect though, for me, would apply to any designers. There is an item limit in the valley, and you are restricted from decorating to your heart's content. The reason being that the game can not easily handle changes to the base design, despite being capable of changing the map layout. Once I'd decorated moderately on the Switch console, it no longer ran without immediately crashing.

I love many Farming/Life Sim games like this and even without the Disney branding this is probably my very favorite, which I didn’t expect. Even in early access its surprising good and has a lot of content. I was worried about grind but this game is actually even less annoying than other life sim games which are single player, to me they hit a perfect spot where I never feel that I have to jump through hoops to accomplish anything and at the same time I always feel like I have more to do. Great job.

I was very concerned about the payment model as F2P games are often notoriously irritating. Either you have to do mind numbing grind or pay huge amounts and even if it is just cosmetic it can be really irritating. However so far this games F2P model is great. Even almost all cosmetics are purchasable with in game money or random free drops, the only thing you pay for are the monthly events (which are 100% cosmetic). Even then you still get access to the event without having to pay but you can only get about half the stuff on offer. Plus these events offer microtransaction money so even then you can probably get full access to probably every 3rd or 4th event for free without spending a dime or real currency.

Edit: they added the shop after I made this review. It wasn't too bad but not great, overall I now give the game a 9.5/10, so still overall fantastic. Mostly the prices for items in the shop are too high, but that's f2p for you and it actually hasn't released as f2p yet, so hopefully it won't get worse.",1663266344,1683228806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I had originally purchased DDV on steam then returned it and purchased on the switch as I wanted something casual I can sit around the house and play, not needing to play at my desk. However, I enjoyed the game so much - but because of all the crashing on the switch I decided to try it on xbox. Xbox allows you to have game pass and play any of those games on PC (via xbox application) and the console itself. After downloading it on PC, I realized the mistake I made... The game is WAY better on the PC itself. After putting a total of almost 9 days of gameplay on the PC I decided it would be worthwhile to purchased it on steam. Which is now leading me to my honest review... The game isn't completed as of yet and you can honestly grind out the story in a matter of days. However you will be decorating your valley for hours! (I could care less about the story line - if I am being honest - I live for the decorating and making the valley my own.) 

Of course, with every game, there are things that would the game even better. But if you are part of the community on discord, they are always asking for input from the players.

SOOO, if you are deciding the purchase the game, I think it is worth it if you enjoy any casual farming games. This will keep you occupied for some time. I will say that it is a bit tedious in the constant mining for materials and farming, but what farming game isn't? But...  You could wait for the game to become free, but for the extra items and moonstone it might just be worth the purchase for the exclusive items and additional moonstone.

My only gripe is the fact that i work full time and i am unable to play during the day when its light so it gets abit annoying not being able to see the valley during the day but i suppose that comes with being an adult and it is only a small complaint. 

It reminds me alot of animal crossing but in my opinion its alot better and i can see it gripping me for a lot longer as there is a story involved. 
Keeps me entertained for hours on end. 
Regardless of what mood i am in there is always something to do.

Been looking for a decent game for a while and this has been a great game after Bear and Breakfast.

Runs perfect on my computer though so for now i will stick to pc.

I used to have a positive review for this game. HOWEVER, upon further playing, talking to the community, talking to mods in their official discord server, and much more, I can no longer keep that review up.
This game has a fairly basic concept. Animal Crossing but with Disney branding. It IS an early access but early access does not mean making your player base a free (not even, we PAID to be their testers) feedback loop for every tiniest bug. Things like models glitching and quests being unfinishable are just ridiculous. The fact some people have issues with their Founders Packs not showing up is annoying and resetting your game even gets rid of the collection items!
I have many hours and I'll continue to play, don't get me wrong, but I cannot recommend this game in its current state to anyone wanting to spend the money on it and ESPECIALLY NOT the special edition packages.

But as you can see it has 42 hours on record, yes that be my partner that plays this game not me.
I brought it for her when released public.
I do want to play it at some point, I think multi save is possible now but don't want risk throwing her progress into the deep void where it cannot be recovered.

So I'm usually sat watching her play this game that feeds her Disney addiction.
Let me paint a picture, I'm usually sat patiently without a complaint, but In my mind I'm fighting the want to play Warframe, Dark Souls, during this time of release I decided to 100% Dark Souls 3, so I wanted to do the other two but Instead I patiently waited whilst she does quests for Donald Duck.
See my review for DS3.
Anyway, Disney.

It looks great, the graphics give me comfort in a sense and the overall visual of the game is bliss.
I like how most of the characters in the Disney universe are in this game and more added in the future.
A lot of characters from my childhood are in this game.
She farms a lot, actually good point brain I just realised, maybe I have put an hour or two on this game.
She was away for a night, asked me to log on to harvest her carrots... now I didn't realise this, but it turns out you can place farm plots ANYWHERE... I think, or from what I saw anyway farm plots were everywhere.

So I spent the next hour or two collecting carrots, selling and re-placing so she can profit coins.
LITERALLY EVERYWHERE by the way, I collected thousands of carrots.
I was expecting a tiny little cute 8x8 square farm plot, but no instead I was asked to farm the entire kingdom lands worth of farm plots.
Brings in a lot of money though.

So if the day comes I decide to play this game, then at least I know to build a farm that is entire map size.

Next up, customisation.
Really like the available clothing items, so many options.
And more unlock during game progression which is great too, it gives a motive to continue I guess.

What else did I witness during my suffering?
Urm...

I didn't see any combat, I think there is combat?
Is there?
I didn't get to witness any epic battles.
So I can't say anything regarding combat, or even if it exists.
I could literally scroll down right now and check the description or google it, ahhhhh
Reader, you have a quest, find out if there is combat if this interests you.

OH, I remember something else now!
Home stuff.
My partner is a... home designer thingy.
So she really enjoys doing that, anytime she asks me if I like her design I always reply ""I'd live in it""
Lots of furniture options and I also believe you can expand your house?
Like pay coins to add a kitchen, more bedrooms and stuff of that sort.
Very much decorations.

Can I think of anything else?

OH Cooking, yes, the cooking is amazing.
I watched her throw ingredients into a pot with mouse drag physics and drop.
Then POW, a meal recipe made thing.
Many ingredients and more can be unlocked.

Great game, looks very fun.
She's had a break recently from it, probably because I use my PC to edit videos and that takes up a lot of time Ahem JiggleBikeRiddle on TikTok, urm what.

Anyway, this is a review made by a person who has watched the game be played by his partner.

Would definitely recommend this game, just please fact check that combat, I can't remember if there is or not.
I will probably edit this review after I post because I decided to google it.

10/10 Disney Dreamlight Valley.
Comfortable looking game, feels of relaxation, beauty of design House & Character Clothing.
Controls feel great, using Keyboard & Mouse, I can't say what controller use is like.

Just an additional note about the whole farming I had to do for her.
I did make a Macro using Razer Synapse eventually, because well... ENTIRE MAP COVERED IN FARM PLOTS.

I could have jumped from my FPS and survived it was that low.
But hey, coins am I right?

If you are here reading reviews of the game because your Partner, Brother, Sister, Mother, Father, Grandfather, Grandmother, Friend, Friend of a Friend, Friend of a Friends Friend likes Disney and you want to gift it them, then go for it.

Right now it's in early access and has a lot of content already it seems, so I imagine in the future the amount of content will be on a level of insane.

This is absolutely MySims + Animal Crossing + Stardew Valley with a robust coat of Disney paint over the whole thing.

It also, somehow, has a million quality of life upgrades that the former games don't have, leading to some SUPER smooth gameplay. For example, you never need to refill your watering can, tools won't break, only be upgraded through quests. Hovering over any item tells you how much it sells for (or if it can be eaten, how much energy it restores), etc.

I'm almost angry at how good this game is. I bought it for laughs because I'm a Disney nerd. But it's ACTUALLY just so good. I can't stop playing it.

EDIT: 130+ hours in. I still have so much more to do. There's more QoL upgrades. Why is this game so fun help.

It is cruel to need that without notice and have everything locked at that point. Im a bit OCD and like nice little neat organization. That means zero night thorn in my area the second I unlock them. Given they are so petty about inventory the game more a game of space management then exploration, befriending the folks in town, etc... There is zero reason you box doesn't have infinite space for the items you already have a stack for. Basically hours now wasted and having to restart.

Ok, I am changing to recomment, because a dev. read responded in less then 24hr. Gave me some hope.

The spawn rate is less of an issue then the blind sided during the curse mission where all animals gone, and all other options.

Would love to recommend the game because its honestly relaxing but the premium shop ruins this greatly, Very over priced so for any 100% collectors...well it will cost you.. other than that there is a consistent issue with items you can place on table getting stuck and you are than not able to remove the items off the table nor remove the table. Extremely frustrating.  

**Update**

Since adding my review the game has been crashing more and more to a point I am not able to play without it crashing in a 10 mins frame..... really irritating at this point. I wouldn't recommend this game until this is fix currently setting it as a 2/10. Really disappointed 

**End Update**


honestly its a decent game but OMG soooooooooooo buggy. toons are constantly in the way when trying to interact with the environment causing you to walk in place before game crashes. handing over quest items to toons causes the  accept screen to freeze while other dialog continues in the background which leads to game crashing. utilizing the plant multiple feature causes your toon to freeze and well a crash of the game. bout 6/10 times fast travel crashes the game... game has alot of potential, and it really is fun to play just needs some work. it could be an easy 10/10 for me but as it stands now 5/10. 

at the end of it all i do enjoy playing and its nice to have a chill laid back style game to disappear into so i would recommend. 

last note here but the auto safe is on point. even with all the crashes once back up i find i have lost nothing i was working on at time of crash.

- The star paths give you lots of things to do even after you finish all the current quests (more are added periodically while the game is still in development)

- loads of cute furniture and clothes
- character dialogue is fun

- it being in early access means there's still often bugs with quests/star paths

It's a great family friendly game with lots to do and explore. I think the developers have been paying attention to the players, and perhaps the negative slew of reviews has helped in that regard.?

In my heart of hearts, where corporations care more for people and less about their bottom line, this game would be a most awesome game. Are you listening, Disney?


First off, this game is in early access.  However, it's blatantly clear that this game is out to get us for the money, not to make a great game that is fun for everyone, especially if you are not flush with money.

Actually, I'm writing this negative review out of protest, along with some other players who are sick of this method of milking us for more money.  There is a part of the game where you collect moonstones to buy special or unique gifts, which comes out every so often.

Recently they added some new products, (that they slipped into this last upgrade) that requires you to have ridiculous amounts of moonstones to collect awesome things to have.  Ah, but no worries, you can purchase more moonstones if you spend dollars for them... and some are pretty pricey to the average person, especially with kids.  And I've put lots of hours into this game.  I'ts gonna be super hard to get that many moonstones by collecting them yourself! The chests that pop up throughout game-play have low to moderate amounts of them to give you. One player estimated $4,000 in costs in a year, to be able to buy everything that is available to buy!! That's just crayziness!!!

And really think about the type of pack you buy at first!  You can't afford the best premium pack? Like me and many others? Well you miss out on, and won't have another opportunity, to get the stuff that comes with it.  Such as special critters and/or other collectibles, and tons of moonstones.  So if you like to collect and complete stuff, you are out of luck.  It's all in the money you spend, you see.  And this is a heavy-collection game.

What erks me a lot about the packages that you purchase is that at some point the game will be free to buy.  But for some reason they have no problem charging us money right now, especially in early access when the game is imperfect.  What about we who invested in this game when it goes free?  I guess we paid to help them make their game better but with no reward. Only a feeling of being used and a bad taste in our mouths - especially if you don't have money to throw away.

I know game creators need to make money - it's called capitalism. However, I'm sure most creators have made money without making it unreasonable for folks who aren't flush. This game feels large corporation squeezing all the money they can get out of us. And that makes it a bummer.

As the game progresses, understandably the requirements for unlocking get much higher but it's exhausting to earn the material when you only earn 50-250 depending on what task you're completing.

It is pretty easy to unlock the characters you want to get but the quests to get there are just about challenging enough to not get boring. Like ACNH the game follows real time of day so I mostly end up only able to play during the evening in game, meaning that some characters - Ursula and Remy in particular - are always asleep so it is hard to do their quests. 
A lot of the early bugs have been fixed but there are still a few; moving between internal and external areas it occasionally freezes (it especially happens when I try to leave Ursula's grotto, or if you have been decorating the village, when you try to leave or exit the furniture mode everything freezes and I can't even interact with the menu or leave the game. You just have to alt F4 and hope it saved recently) and even with my graphic settings turned way down the lag on my characters movement is painful, especially if it is raining in game. 
Overall I really like the game but I hope some improvements are made to help with the graphics issues.
Update: some of the lag with the character running around have got better, but the game constantly gets stuck with me walking in place when trying to leave a building if Mirabel or Stitch are in the way. These don't fix themselves, the only way out is to Alt F4. Also there is a bug where Eric just won't hang out with you so it's hard to level him up.

I started playing this game on my Nintendo switch, but I had issues with the game constantly crashing. I have a gaming PC, so why not play it on there?

Anyways, I had a few issues with this game recently, my game would somewhat crash/freeze? I'm not sure what to call it. If I was decorating my world and then clicked back to save it would be stuck in a state of eternal loading so I would have to close the game completely, or when selecting what seeds to plant again I'd be stuck in a state of not being able to do anything and would need to close and relaunch.

The devs don't seem to have any interest in fixing this bug that prevents you from progressing any further into the game.

Edit2: The game is irredeemably broken! It feels like it's getting worse! devs don't care. Rather not. End.

Edit3: Wow, Steam won't let me upvote negative reviews? Stay far away from this game!

Growing up watching Disney movies in the 60s and 70s, Bambi, Snow White, Cinderella, I love the fairy-tale aesthetics of Disney animation. I was immediately drawn in and captivated by the beautiful graphics in the game. I lose all sense of time and space as I immerse myself  in this charming world. 

The gameplay is equally as absorbing. Despite the repetitiveness of the basic tasks that need to be done to progress in the game, at the same time there's a richness of side quests that keeps one from ever getting bored. The learning curve is about medium, the controls are very intuitive. Though I would like to have had a hotkey to switch between the [spoiler]shovel and the watering can[/spoiler]. Maybe I can remap some controls, I'll see. 

The game is still very buggy, be aware. I feel it is worth the trouble as I am in love with this game! I love the gorgeous dresses and other outfits you can get! So many nice things, beautiful, pretty things. I don't normally like buying upgrades with real world money but I'm thinking of buying the Ultimate Edition DLC :P It's just a really beautiful and fun game that satisfies my inner need to be a Disney Princess :)",1670794481,1681253214,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Unfortunately, the games recent updates which include (not so) micro-transactions have made such a negative impact on me and my mentality about the game as a whole, that I no longer have much interest to play.  Seeing how I already spent $30 on the game itself, now they are trying to squeeze every penny out of the players, making me feel like I must spend more money to get these limited items. The ""star path"" used to be a fun way to have small ""quests"" to keep you moving and have tasks/things to focus on.  However, now that you have to have a ridiculous amount of moonstones to unlock the ""premium"", the only real way to get that is to spend more money. The prices they have for these packs are unrealistic compared to what you actually receive for them, and of course, its something you will need to keep buying more of with every new ""star path"", and that's not even including if you want to purchase  the other accessories available not included in the star path.
Gameloft did this to another Disney game I used to play on my phone; where they made it so you MUST spend more money if you want to win/collect all these ""limited edition"" and rare items.  It is a shame that the developers are preying on the players like this to manipulate us into feeling we need to give in to their hostage demands to release the goods we already paid for when purchasing the game!
If they make the game free to play, like there have been talks about, and wish to set up in-game micro-transactions at that point; I can understand doing that (they got to make their money somehow). But having so many ""required"" purchases while the game is still $30, just feels like a scam to me.

Timed Mobile mechanics really don't belong on a pc game period. I want to just play, not wait hours for something to grow to finish a quest... that's stupid. It makes sense on a phone that you put aside and continue playing once something is ready, but not on this.

On top of that, they have in-app purchases and events like a mobile game, in an Early Access game at that... Right, so before finishing the game content and fixing bugs, they make sure to finish a cash shop.... on a paid game. Furthermore, there isn't that many characters yet, and new ones come very slowly. Its looking like they will slowly trickle them out over years (so they will never truly be content complete).

Just like most games like these, its also clear that you need to grind gradually more and more as you progress, literally re-doing the same things over and over again for hours, just to complete a few quest and maybe unlock a new area. So I'm realising that, If I want to unlock all the characters they add in the future, I will need to grind 10X more than I already am... I just can't

To add to my previous experience : I received excellent response from Gameloft Support and Reddit.  However, after successful hours of gameplay I have been unable to log in yet again and when logging into to Steam on PC all my previous hours have appeared to have been lost.  Even with using cloud update this has not fixed issue.

It has had some hiccups along the way but they seem to be a thing of the past.  When I've had issues with my Steam Deck it has been very quickly fixed.  The discord with this game is amazing.  The folk there can help with anything which may well be faster than reporting a problem but the report problem page was also prompt and efficient.

This has no right to be as good as it is, but I'm here for it. It's Disney Animal Crossing and its art style absolutely belies not only how much original content is here, but also how generally fair and plentiful it is. This actually isn't some shovelware, p2w, mobile title ported to PC - this is a full-fledged game with interesting and somewhat original mechanics with regular content updates.

If you like (or god forbid love) Disney IP's and you just want a chill game that's actually worth it, this game is what you're looking for. If you just want animal crossing but you don't mind the Disney aesthetic, this game might be worth looking into as well. Legitimately.

Again - this shouldn't be good. It has absolutely no right to be good.

I always wished for a game like Animal Crossing but one that would also be a live service game so that it will always get new exciting stuff with updates, this is when I found out about Dreamlight Valley. Back then it was only a series of trailers and gameplay videos with nothing too concrete, I decided to blindly preorder the game on Nintendo Switch because of my urge of such a game.

I knew this game would become a free to play live service game at some point and it would contain microtransactions which made me be scared of how they would handle it and sadly some of my fears were confirmed during this Early Access. I will go through my honest review of the game itself. 

It was September 6th 2022 when the game released in Early Access which was also the day I started playing (on Nintendo Switch), I was (and still am) so into this game, the art style is adorable, the music is nice and of course I am a big Disney fan, it was the perfect combination for me: Animal Crossing inspired game in the Disney universe. 
Fast forward through some updates, story was continued, mechanics were balanced with the feedback of community, quality of life features requested by the community were added but also a new feature was added which kind of split the community in two, the Premium Shop.

It was at this point when the Premium Shop was added I was able to see how the monetization would go when the game will release free to play and I am not a big fan of it. Yes, the items are purely optional but the money required to get them is kind of outrageous (it somehow put The Sims 4 in a better view). I feel like the only way to justify such prices would be that the items would have color variations included. So far after community feedback on the Discord server I did not feel any change to the Premium Store prices which is a shame and I hope that they will reconsider them until release. 

On another subject, something else that has been bothering me is decorating, the grid style which was added can make items unable to look symmetric or fit perfectly with each other as a result making decorating a bit more painful at least for people who want everything to be neatly arranged. This might not be a problem for everyone but for me, sometimes it is.

As a conclusion, Dreamlight Valley is a fun and relaxing game, which could be sometimes quite grindy (which I personally don't mind because it gives me stuff to do) and the Premium Shop has some... special prices... but overall I recommend the game, it has the things I have always wanted from Animal Crossing.",1680781472,1680781472,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,True

I have over 100 hours in the game. I bought the game the week it was released. I am patient of the game being in early access, so the dozens of bugs and glitches didn't bother me-- but at the beginning of March, I experienced a very inconvenient glitch. I had logged off like normal (while saving), and a few hours later I logged back on to find that several characters were missing from my log and I had been set back to a save that looked like it was from around December or earlier? I know this may not seem like a big deal, I could just continue where the game has set me back to and make my progress again, but what if it happens again? 

I contacted Gameloft on March 11th and did not get a response for 10+ days. I tried reaching out via social media platforms but no luck. When I finally got a response, they basically said ""we're looking into it."" Days later I contacted again and was basically told there's nothing I can do to recover my saves. It's not so much the missing storyline that aggravates me, but the loss of items and how I had set my village up. 

I know this is an early access game. But the cloud save hardly works for me, and to have one save file but somehow the game reverted back to an earlier save is just super confusing.  I LOVE this game. I WANT to keep playing it, but I am incredibly put out by this.

Disney Dreamlight Valley or DDV for short is a life sim, relaxing game where you can fish with Goofy, garden with Mickey, cook with Remy, and a even Mine Gems With Scrooge McDuck!! 
The Story is Simple and Easy too follow even between major updates it ties in your favorite Disney Characters quite well and this is just a wholesome game and fun for the Disney adults and the Kids as well .
NOW!! there is a grind too the game but it's a chill relaxing vibe for example gardens take real time too grow and the game does need to be active so you can't plant a 4 hour plant log off and come back later too my knowledge at least ( I did try) way back near release.

You have very easy tasks from the get-go, the very rare puzzle that is not just *search for A at place X* and mostly just collecting stuff, much like you would in Animal Crossing. The selling point here is clearly that you have your Disney characters around you - which at the game's current state just means that they have like.. 3 lines they drop if you cross their path (in German mostly not with the correct voices, sadly, even though at least some would have been available). Some of those characters can become a little annoying even; standing in your way, making the same animation in an endless loop until you go further away (looking at you, Maui..). What I personally found sad was that even if you try to connect with the baddies like Scar, they just.. stay evil even towards you. 
This game has a lot of potential but I fear it will stick to the current mobile-esque system and not expand on any more complicated systems like for example factions where your decisions actually matter. So far it really doesn't matter what you do or say. It's very... child-friendly, so to say. Even though there are *bad* answers you can give almost in every conversation, the character you are talking to will have forgotten what you picked past the next sentence. Nobody holds a grudge, gets distrustful, angry or happy. It's quite lifeless. 

Sadly I cannot recommend this game at the time that I am writing this review. 

Now that the premium shop is there and over half the event items are only available if you pay real money, this game turned around to become the mobile game my girlfriend warned me it would become eventually.
Considering I paid to get early access, I just find it revolting that there is that much expensive content coming into this game now. For example: a simple skin for your house was implemented that makes it look like a palace. 3750 Moonstones just for that. Of course you can only but either 2500 Moonstones for $9 or 5500 Moonstones for $18, making this *skin* for your house almost a 20$ investment unless you never paid anything else with those Moonstones, of which you get 50 a day. Oh and such offers don't stick around for long enough to try and lay aside that much anyway; you better just buy it right away.

Honestly, the game isn't bad by definition and I enjoyed my time in it at least enough to come back near-daily, but since the premium shop is in it and a premium track paywalls that much stuff, I haven't played anymore. Maybe I will return at some point; I'll stick to the Discord for now, uninstall and see if any changes happen to the newly implemented paywalling.

Oh and I hate Olaf and just want to kick him each time I see him. -_-'",1680686678,1680686678,False,3,0,0.521191775798797607,0,True,False,True

Some things quests and items feel very grindy to get tho and I love the characters, but I do wish they added more lines and actions to each one, especially their own quests. 
After about 50h of playtime, I can say this is a fun game on the side to have and to come back to for a calm hour of play
Annoying stuff:
•	Rooms are all separated by a door in your house, and you cant keep expanding one room 
•	Why not snow everywhere? Its almost mid Dec ☹ I was looking forward to the houses with snow on them and the valley covered 

Clothes:
I really like the clothes option they have so far. The tool to customise items is awesome but can use some add in and tweaks:
•	No pants options to customise
•	No way to put pattern around a hem line (such as around the bottom of a skirt or shirt)
•	It would be nice to see more patterns having colour options
•      You do not have an option of linking a pattern together to form a line of pattern
•	Sizing isn’t standard on all patterns, so some can only be very big
•	No option to put jewel/sparkle pattern on clothes 
•	More types of clothes to customise, especially bottoms
•	More of a zoom out option in editing mode for clothes
•       Cardigan/sweater/coat should be able to go over a dress
•	Not able to colour block clothes
•	The long dresses kicks up so high at the back, a good 30% of that would be fine and visible, I do not need to see up their dress the whole time I’m running around

I wish there were more characters, especially the counters to characters already in the game (e.g. Daisy, Rapunzel, Flynn, Eve). There are a few quests that are a pain (Mother Gothel's quest that you need to log in at certain times to do). Also, keep your basic rainbow colored gems, you need so many of them later. Also the Onyx gems as those get you upgrades later on. The water based character quests feel impossible (Ariel and Urusla). 

HOWEVER, this game is great. I love every moment I've spent in it, even the long winded ones. I feel like I am rewarded for my efforts. It's no animal crossing, but I will keep playing this over and over.",1680401284,1680401284,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is Kingdom Hearts meets Stardew Valley meets the Sims. You farm, you fish, you build relationships with the characters, but you also complete quests, use magic, craft and collect stuff.

Second, I've played since *nearly* first release in EA, and have only see this game get better and better each update.  I love being a part of early access, and getting to see the team work, problem solve, develop, as well as the feedback and communication with the team. They've truly heard the communities requests and have never failed to come thru with changes and fixes, even silly little things we ask for! 

Many people are reacting negatively because they failed to consider what buying into this game would entail.  During the EA period, we KNEW the game would be free to play eventually (which ofc means they'll need funding sources long term, in-game) and that parts of the premium content WOULD be added before FtP was released.  I think GL is doing a fantastic job navigating a game that attracts a large variety of people.  And I think they've remained very professional while such loud groups of people complain that not everything is free and that the game isn't finished. 

EA games will ofc be a WiP, it will always be a bit of effort to balance and correct certain things, and not everyone will be happy unless 100% of everything is given to the for free in unlimited amounts.  
Please disregard people complaining about the premium costs and give this game a try. Even if you wait until FtP, it's done wonders for me, and the community around it is incredible.

Good
Nice art style for the game, most characters look like how they should.
Somewhat relaxing game when certain characters aren’t being annoying with their animations.
It’s mostly easy to get the materials that you need.
Characters can have a passive power that helps you get more items.
Story is okay but has major plot holes.
It’s the only game that I know of where you can have a bunch of Disney characters walking around. Sort of reminds me of a theme park.
With all the bugs appearing when doing quests, it never actually broke the quest and I was able to complete it.
You can play offline.
The Christmas event was very forgiving in the moonstones that they gave back.
The music is great.
The 2-3 lines of voiced dialogue that each character has, sound like their actual voice actor.


Bad
There are so many game breaking bugs. I’ve read some of the updates but it’s been months and no fixes.

The game runs badly when the world of the game is small. Isn’t gameloft like some massive company? Anyways, after an hour of playing Dreamlight Valley each day, I’ve been playing Assassins Creed Odyssey and it's just a breath of fresh air to enjoy such a vast beautiful openworld game that runs good with no loading.

The story has some major plot holes, the big one when we find out about the person who was stuck on an island.

Merlin is the answer to all the story’s problems which sucks hard for a story. I’m tired of it.

A lot of characters don’t look like how they should like Moana, Elsa, woody, Ratatouille, and prince eric.

Donald’s animation is the most annoying one in the game and it happens so frequently. Anna’s one is just as bad. All animations happen so often.

There’s this dark fading edge around the whole screen that bothers me so much.

When harvesting crops it may shine and glow gold which is when you can keep picking at it to get more of that crop. The problem is, is that the character hanging out with you will come right to it and then you’ll accidentally talk to them. Thus making that whole shiny glowing gold thing useless. The little pet companion that you have walking around can mess it up as well. You can turn pet off, though.

Characters can block your way and are unpushable. You can get softlocked by this.

No key bindings option.

Pictures that you collect can stay on the screen when you get them which softlocks the game.

Fast traveling can softlock the game where the screen stays on and won’t close.

Exiting rooms can make you walk infinitely into it unless you close the game.

Turning down voices to zero in the sound options doesn’t stop you from hearing Donald’s animation and yelling.

Edit: Full chests can now be made for free.

All Disney characters sparkle.

Resolution scale option was 1 at default. When 2 makes the game what it should be. Why make the game look blurry by default? Pure incompetence? I think so.

No way to lock items in your chest or inventory. Making food when using the autofill can use a Christmas fish. Some people may collect those and hope to save them, but those Christmas fish are the first to be used.

Low amount of items that you can buy at Kristoff stall each day. 

Digging spots can appear next to a house where you’ll be unable to dig it. So you have to move the house or not dig.

Some quests are mind numbingly grindy. The ones that want the pink and black crystals are some of the worst. But that one Minnie quest was pretty bad.

Prince eric had a quest where we had to build him some metal diving suit and nothing happened. Just fades to black and he said he did it and found stuff then gives you a single diving helmet.

All things that characters do fade to black. You worked hard to make a band equipment for a band? Well, you don’t get to hear them play or see any special animation, just a fade to black and take a ”picture” of this oh so special event.

It feels like the crops will only grow in real-time. I went to bed after planting pumpkins which should take 4 hours only. When I woke up they were still growing.

Why does price eric need a house in the village? We need characters like Bambi and Dumbo. You know, like the main characters of films and not a bunch of characters connected to the main characters.

No auto water plants like auto seeding.

When crafting items, you can’t use “LB” to go back. It breaks the menu and you have to close the crafting menu and reopen it to use it.

When going into the fence option in the crafting menu, it will break the menu every time. Do not go into the fence option if you can’t craft fences yet.

Items that you have to craft for villagers don’t appear at the top after the first time of seeing it appear. So you have to scroll down which takes a long time.

The mouse breaks and becomes usable when using any menu.

You can’t kick villagers out.

Takes too long to scroll through the cooking menu.

Some quests can take days and are locked at doing them at night.

I wish the Disney worlds were like a kingdom hearts quest instead of talk to the character in a small box, pick up stuff, build house, and done.


Conclusion

That’s all that I have to say for now as I’m about to hit the word limit. The game is alright and it’s the only game where you see some of these characters again in a somewhat relaxing setting. Sort of wish I didn’t spend so much money on it.",1673912364,1680055066,False,9,0,0.507953941822052002,0,True,False,True

For an early access game this is pretty solid. Think Animal Crossing but Disney characters; the art style is great, the tunes are amazing instrumentals from the songs, and there's a really good amount of customisation both of your avatar and the valley too. You can hang out with a great section of the characters that also have really cute idle animations.

Contrary to popular belief, the microtransactions aren't overwhelming (which was something I was worried about). You can actually get to what you want by completing in game tasks and quests; I'm 16 hours in at time of writing and I've never felt the need to purchase anything, it's there as an option.

On the other hand, it is expensive for what it is, I'd recommend getting it on sale.",1679856287,1679856287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've always wanted to get into this type of game since Harvest Moon but could never understand it as a kid. I tried Stardew Valley as an adult, while a lot of things to do, it didn't quite grasp me.

This game has a lot going for it.

The I.P alone is a force to be reckoned with. The music is Disney music (with option to turn on streamer mode so you're safe to stream), the characters are your childhood along with newer ones and they are all charming/adorable/funny. 

The attention to detail is amazing. They look, sound and are like the characters. I was VERY impressed when I got a certain character and she started dancing Salsa. I was genuinely not expecting it and I was blown away. They hum/whistle their themes sometimes when they're wandering around and their homes are literally what I'd expect them to look like.

There is an insane amount of customization. You can move almost everything around to YOUR liking and with so many free items, I can see anyone who's hardcore about it, invest HUNDREDS OF HOURS into this game. I've also been informed by my wife (who ended up getting this after watching me play) that one of the best things this game has vs. Animal Crossing is that you can alter your home even if others are in it (which sounds like such a insanely overlooked mechanic to have had in a game in the first place)

 There's a ton to do with and there are multiple expansions that are free (I was convinced to buy this game once I learned that Stitch was in the first expansion!). I'm very excited for what's the come!

This game is the perfect farming & chill game. The music and atmosphere coupled with these characters makes me feel like I'm at Disney World and I constantly feel rewarded when I farm literally anything.

There are bugs here and there but the devs acknowledge them the moment those bugs come to their attention and they've always fixed them ASAP, it's an early access game and all games have their bugs, I've never personally encountered any that broke my game. 

The style is charming and cute, I love the wide variety of clothing and furniture, there's definitely something for everyone. There are a wide variety of skintones, and customization and clothing isn't gender locked, rejoice! 

The cooking is something I want to especially point out as being really fun and cute, I like that you can use the food as decor (and I do)

My one warning to parents (if you are one) is that there are (cosmetic) in-app purchases, so if your child isn't old enough to understand not to buy things/you're afraid they might accidentally buy things, make sure you set steam  to Offline mode!

I paid for Early Access (the Standard Edition) and I don't regret it. 

The characters are well done - their dialogue/characterization matches their personalities and they'll have music associated with their respective movies. It's a great touch! My favourite thing is that you can become friends with the villains, which seems strange, but their quests might be a bit evil and the way they treat you makes sense (they insult you or the other characters!). Characters also sometimes interact with each other which is cute to see.

In terms of bugs, I haven't had anything game-breaking myself. Any quest-breaking bugs preventing me from completing a quest have been fixed in updates. The Devs are quite good about fixing things (you may have to wait for the next update though). I have a high end PC and get a constant 60 FPS and the game looks great, but the latest update has occasional stuttering that eventually forces me to restart the game to fix. I can't speak for the performance on lower end PCs or other consoles (which apparently have more crashes and issues - this is why I didn't buy it on Switch...).

I like the events so far, but I recommend looking up a guide to understand how the Star Path works and how to best spend Moonstones. I found it a bit confusing at first. You also need to be careful - I hear it's easy to spend all your Founder's Pack Moonstones in the events for the Star Path items if you don't understand. They give a lot of time to complete events (as long as you don't leave them until last minute), but if you aren't far enough into the game, the events might give you tasks for characters or items you don't have access to yet (which I found frustrating).

Moonstones (the premium currency that comes with the Founder's Packs) are mostly used for the Star Path in the events or in the Premium shop (just released). I haven't spent any on the shop yet but you can also now buy Moonstones with real money, which I also haven't done. These items seem expensive in my opinion. 

Overall, I'm happy with this game so far, and I like that they're still updating it and adding characters. The events keep me coming back, even when I've taken a break.

It'll be interesting to see how the game changes once it's releases for free. I think it's fine to wait, but if you don't mind buying the founder's pack now, then I think it's worth it too (at least on PC). :)",1679168051,1679168137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The questing is well-done. There is much to do, especially with the special events. Even though my level, neighbors, and buildings are mostly maxed out, it didn't feel like a grind.

There are some bugs and animation issues, but the game is in pre-release. There is a premium shop (lots of people are complaining about) in preparation that the game will be free; however, it seems to be all cosmetic. If they make me pay to unlock characters/materials/money/etc, then I would be pissed.

Oh yeah, Gameloft, please add something so real-life friends can somehow someway interact with my valley. I would appreciate it!

With the introduction of the new premium shop items priced at $50 for 9 cosmetic items on rotation after 5 days and items literally being recoloured and sold as new items among many other issues and bugs.

Let's not forget about the fact that the game is clearly falsely advertised. Gameloft stating that the premium store would not be in the early access version of the game, I dunno about you? but when I pay for early access to a game and all of its contents until it became/becomes free to play I expect to get it. 

I also know that the items in the premium store do not prevent a player from passing quests, events, or the storyline of the game and that they are cosmetic but that is irrelevant.

And I absolutely adore this game. 

One of the few early access titles I feel 100% satisfied in purchasing, I bought this game because I am into the type of exploration and systematic unlocking of certain gates within the game while it unravels a compelling story. Despite the bugs that are predictably in an unfinished game, nothing I have encountered has been severe enough for me to uninstall and wait for it to bake a bit longer. I'm eagerly awaiting updates as I push to become ""best friends"" with all of the available characters. Each of their stories and questlines feels so nostalgic to their characters. The way that the characters mesh with each other and bring to light their individual desires all the while remaining in a persistent state of positivity and encouragement is extremely refreshing and compelling. Characters encourage you to keep doing what you're doing and fill you with positive reinforcement as you go about your tasks and it genuinely makes me feel better. I'd recommend this game in it's current state to anyone that loves fetch quests, building and exploring, and Disney as a whole. The monetization is a minimal aspect to the game, and while I completely understand that it might cause some other reviewers to react negatively, I don't feel that it's intrusive or takes away anything from the game (Although that might change when multiplayer is incorporated). 

See below for observations both positive and negative: 

1. While it's great that the devs allow any and all clothing to be worn by any body style, I'd really like to see more specifically male-oriented options - especially as quest rewards. I understand that it's a bit difficult when a literal Disney princess offers an iconic dress, but this is your time as a dev to use your imagination and create a male equivalent! How about a Frozen Tuxedo, or a Minnie mouse polka dot Button Down Oxford Shirt? It would add a lot of value for you to be inspired by classical apparel in new and interesting creations. 

2. Your sound designers are fantastic. All the ambient crystal hums and fauna sounds in the different zones make the game really pop. The inspired musical scores make me want to buy the soundtrack. Please keep doing that. Perhaps create some special remixes and allow the player to play them with the DJ booths? Dance parties/emotes? I also encourage you to add location specific easter eggs! (Chances for certain sounds like hyenas cackling in the elephant graveyard, or play the fantasia music when interacting with the magical broom). 

3. Some of your bugs are a bit frustrating, but expected. Examples: Characters not allowing you to pass through or push them randomly (Add an unstuck feature!), Players sometimes don't transition when entering/exiting buildings (Fixed by alt+tabbing out/in the game). 

4. Some of the props (furniture, etc) is really too expensive. It's taking almost a week to gather all the flowers to build a single balloon arch. Doesn't that seem a bit excessive? Here's a suggestion: Allow the character to build zone specific stalls (Like Kristoff's). Bring in the 7 dwarves and let them mine gems in a mine similar to Wall-e's garden and Moana's Fishing boat! 

5. Donald falls down way too much. 

6. Ariel and Ursula are quite challenging to level up as friends because you can't hang out with them. Perhaps provide an alternative way to interact such as fetching random doo-dads for Ariel's collection (like when digging with wall-e) or provide Ursula with magical potions and be a test subject for her! (drink this potion and briefly turn into a fish flopping on the ground). 

7. Real time constraint can be really off-putting to those that can only play the game certain times of the day. Consider making the day/night cycle a 4, 6, or 12 hour rotation instead. Allow changes to props/furniture/lights to be based on time of day. Characters ""sleeping"" is an excessive gate that really doesn't need to be there. Consider removing or exchanging for an alternative (Ariel/Moana is exploring, or Buzz and Woody are playing etc). 

8. Weather is great, but this is a magical world! Make some rare weather! twinkling lights in the swamp, fireworks around the castle, magical blue snow in the frost, etc.

I don't have an issue with a premium shop, but I do think the timing of it is not great and the items presented are both overpriced and severely lacking. I know the devs are doing their best. If you can't buy anything with the lowest amount of moonstones purchasable, you should review your prices. Very disappointed.

----

It's a fun game, so far. Hopefully they will add more to the final game, as it might get tedious doing the same kind of quests and tasks over and over again. Some of the controls are a bit clunky and you might get stuck walking into a bush rather than being able to seamlessly go around it.

The game is fun, to a point, then its get to be a chore. I have put in a lot of time with this game and do not feel that, as a game of this type, doesn't fit the bill with other animal crossing styled games. I mean, the game is made by Gameloft.

Pros: 
+ Fun for the Disney Fan
+ Unlock Disney and Pixar characters that you can team up with
+ Buy all the Disney merch you want (as long as you have a large pumpkin farm to pay the bills)
+ Decorate you house and the entire town, even move trees, rocks, bushes, and (my favorite) town portals (even across zones that are not open yet... unless they patch it)
+ The events are nice (wish there were more happening in them), earn moonstones for doing some quests to help buy a few items from the cash shop (see cons as well...)

Cons:
- Expect a lot of grinding for materials. You will have some quests where the Disney character is looking at you for the materials and you can almost hear them saying ""Do you even grind bro?"" For those grinding for the Buzz's balloon arch or 100 iron for the Disney water tower, you know exactly what I mean.
- Scrooge is Tom Nook, plain and simple. His store prices in his shop is weird at times. You would buy a dress for 20,000 but spend less on an entire bedroom and living room set.
- The cash shop (buying moonstones and now buying sets of furniture or clothing items for your character are about as ridiculous as Fortnite's cash shop. Disney/Gameloft, if you haven't been paying attention to recent events with Fortnite's $245 million dollar settlement with the FTC, you might want to change course. Trust me, I bought the biggest moonstone pack and still think its not worth it.
- The events do have a limited amount of quests you can do to earn moonstones. You would earn enough for one or two of the small cash shop packs, but nothing as big as a new house skin. This con really hit a nerve with me as you already can do an unlimited amount of normal events for dream shards to unlock parts of town or open doors in the castle. Trust me, before you know you will have tens of thousands of Dreamshards that will pile up.
- Chests rarely dropping special items and drop a measly amount of gold. Chests would start dropping single item clothing bags, but after awhile, the chances get less and less.
- Resource memories shard that turn into cash. Another thing that struck a nerve. I have played for 117 hours (currently) and have not, I repeat, HAVE NOT completed a single memory picture. Its not like you get anything special aside from placing that in your memory frame in your house (which you ONLY GET ONE MEMORY FRAME!!). This shouldn't be that hard to obtain, and I find it frustrating to know that when you complete it, you get no other reward.
- Special clothing window displays ran out of clothes and just sit empty. Why don't they use it for other clothing items? I paid scrooge for more space to sell product and he's giving me the McDonalds milkshake machine is broken vibe.

There is more I can share, but I think I got my point across. I only play the game at this point to buy the daily random few clothes and furniture from Scrooge, buy stuff out of Kristoph's materials cart, pick up fish from Moana's boat, farm Wall-e's garden of randomness, find the single daily blue and green (and sometimes gold) chest in the area, and do my pumpkin farms for cash. That's it. At least my wife enjoys it, but she's got under 40 hours, so I give it some time before the boredom kicks in.",1677845345,1677845345,False,9,0,0.529388785362243652,0,True,False,True

The developers added premium shop despite it saying that it will not be added until the game goes F2P, they expect people to pay for items in a game that is littered with bugs. These prices are downright predatory, $25 gets you three pieces of mediocre furniture. Please just buy another game at that price. These are macrotransactions not microtransactions. Additionally items are misleading and having different colors than what is shown in premium shop, and there is no way to refund. The in-game shop lacks variety and you will get the same items over and over weekly, and it feels that making money is the developer's primary motive at this time. The premium items are also not that impressive and could have easily been added to the non-premium item pool. Some of the NPC's house items are listed as premium, showing the intent to lock some already present items in the game behind pay walls. Is an item really premium if the NPCs have it?I would totally buy things if they were at all reasonable, but this is too much to ask.

The basic premise, is that you have to save Dreamlight Valley from darkness, by clearing away nightmare thorns, restoring the valley and unlocking your fave Disney characters - I paid for this game in Early Access and have spent more than enough time to justify the cost - with exclusive rewards and regular updates, this game has kept my interest since the beginning. 

One downside, however, is the cost of moonstones. They are STUPID expensive, especially if you have paid for the game and are not playing the free to play model. The skins, objects and items you can get in the store using moonstones are all super cute, but not everyone, and certainly I, can't afford to spend 15 AUD on moonstones, to not even be able to afford one item in the store. I also wish the variety in scrooge's store was better randomised, as I get very little in the way of new items.

However, I would strongly advise waiting until the game is FREE TO PLAY. I bought the Ultimate Edition and I really wish I would have waited. Even for being early access, there really is not a lot of content to go through. It's clear by the last update of the game and the decrease in quality of the Star Path and other objects/items added that they are more concerned with the monetization of the game than the quality/price/content.

The Premium Shop was introduced and not only is the pricing waaaay off the mark (they make Sims 4 packs look like a value, for reference), but the quality of the items are hardly ""premium"". The coloring is different when you actually get the item, the animations are weird for some clothing items, and half of the items they are putting in the shop are nearly identical to items you can already purchase in game at Scrooge's store with in-game currency. It's good they don't count towards the collections, but I don't know who is willing to pay for poor quality items, ESPECIALLY at the high prices they're setting. 

I understand the game is in EA. But focus on fixing the issues in game play rather than trying to gouge us for more money. Once the quests end (and they are easy and quick to complete) there really is no reason to log into the game unless you're going to spend money for the premium items. So, again, it's all a ploy to get you to spend your cash.

I'm not sure that I'm going to continue playing unless they start giving a lot more content to work with.

With the most recent game update, I feel the need to update my review.   At first, I was super excited about the potential of this game.  It was clearly just the bare bones but with so many characters, there was so much that could be done eventually.  Unfortunately, there has been too much focus on NEW and not enough fixing of the bugs and glitches that have been documented and crowd sourced..   WHY is the male avatar STILL significantly faster than the female?  Why does goofy, moana and kristoff have a 30% success rate for appearing at their stalls on the first click.  Why does it take me 500 hours to harvest and plant pumpkins because my avatar gets stuck and freezes every few crops.  The list goes on.  While some of the updates have been great (like the house doors), they honestly should have been prioritized earlier.  

Here's the real reason for this review update tho. ... The premium store.   Not only are the prices OUTRAGEOUS for the quality and quantity that you are getting, even after the devs said they had taken feedback into account... but WHYYYY do we even have a premium store?  The game is unfinished, feels cheap and rushed, and now they are begging for money?  Should we be concerned that the game is running out of budget or angry that the devs are prioritizing the creation of money grabbers instead of finishing the game?  Either way its an ugly look for something unfinished when games like Harry Potter are being released. .

Been playing on and off for a little over a week and I'm really enjoying this game.  I am a millennial Disney fan and the nostalgia hits the spot.  I enjoy games like rune factory and stardew; this has the right amount of balance between farming and adventure, and I love the way we are unlocking characters.  The customization options are a dream.  The only things I find myself missing are navigation supports like jumping and sprinting, but the quick portals are amazing.

On one hand, this game is genuinely fun and relaxing when it works. It plays like an Animal Crossing game, only with quest lines and Disney characters to recruit to your town. Even with some bugs, I played this for days in a row and enjoyed myself.

Problem is, it’s only fun when it WORKS. Small bugs are one thing, as it’s early access this is understandable. However, at the current moment there is a well-known crash issue with the game that causes players to loose all of their save data, with NO way to retrieve it. The game operates by saving either locally or to the cloud, neither of which are accessible to the player. Folks are losing tens of hours of gameplay from crashes with no solution proposed.

On top of all this, buying early access doesn’t net you anything other than a couple of cosmetic items and some in-game currency. Once the game officially releases, it’ll be free to play. If I had known I was paying to be a QA tester, I’d have waited too.

-- Edit --

There's now apparently a Premium shop with prices more predatory that the most infamous EA shenanigans. Previously you could get furniture pieces in the Star Path if you wanted; apparently not anymore, you have to pay the outrageous Premium shop prices or potentially miss out on one-time items.

Not everyone has the luxury to play this game however long they want, when they want, to make sure they can get the items they want. Which may make some players feel like they need to resort to micro-transactions, to make sure they have those items. And it doesn't really give the player much incentive to do the duties which, not only does it complete dream light duties, but also helps with completing missions. I'm not saying there shouldn't be micro transactions, but I think there should be another way for players, who don't have much time in their day to play this game, who can't afford whatever amount of moonstones they need for the rewards. If the missed Items were brought back in future star path duties, or even came as in like a marketplace feature, so that items were accessible to players who missed these items when they're able to afford them with moonstones, then there wouldn't be too much of an issue, in my opinion. I also don't like the idea of micro transaction in a game, primarily targeted towards children. Yes, I know the game is targeted towards everyone however, once this game is free to play, more children than adults would be playing this game. Still, if you're not bothered about the star path duties, this game is good to relax with when you're able to. I just hope some bugs that have been there since the early access launch, are fixed before free to play. My main issue; my save not loading properly until I reload the game, sometimes more than once.

- Awesome fashion
- New cosmetics every update
- Ability to redesign the valley 
- Disney content
- There is a Discord community that takes feedback

Cons:
- There isn't an option to automate digging/planting, which could be time consuming 
- You can plant a seed, but wouldn't be able to remove it. You'll have to wait until it grows and is ready to be harvested to empty that one spot.
- It would be easier to have a ""transfer"" button popup asking how many, rather than a separate ""transfer"" and ""split"" button when moving items between inventory to storage because splitting will require an additional slot in the inventory anyway
- There is no categorizing for the inventory, would be good to have tabs to sort out items
- There are no behavior dynamics for NPCs in game; they will behave and say the same things when you interact with them
- There's no weather forecast or a clock to tell how much time has passed
- Looting time on bonus harvested crops is very short, if only they could extend it so that player don't have to manually loot every single one after a huge harvest; that or make an automated feature
- There isn't a way to cook multiple meals at once; right now players can only cook one dish at a time 
- There's no telling whether an item has been collected yet when shopping at Scrooge's store

You have a lot of items to ""forage"" however the ability to store items can be very frustrating, you cannot label any of your storage boxes, which means you have to stand opening each and every box to look for items! (very annoying).

Recently the game added the ability of ""micro transaction"" cosmetics, i am all for the game trying to support itself with making additional money however it's outrageously expensive to buy items, a simple cosmetic item can cost almost £20-£30 and the store updates weekly.

if you like Minecraft, Dinkum, Animal Crossing and scavenging/building style games then this is perfect for you, but be aware it is going free to play eventually, so you can wait it out or you can buy it.

The game has limitless potential but is trending toward disaster. 

I was a day one purchaser on Switch and ultimately bought the game a second time on Steam to play with better performance. My save file was corrupted at some point after 200+ hours due to my clock on my switch not being set to the current date. I move the clock on my switch for other games(Mostly Pokemon) and forgot one day to reset it back to normal, and that was all it took when I logged into the game on there to break my game.  There is currently no fix for a save file corrupting due to ""time traveling"" even if you weren't explicitly doing so, but I said ""Fine. My mistake"" after waiting weeks for my game to ""fix"" on its own after receiving advice from other players. I nuked my entire file to start over because the game does not allow multiple save files.  When your game gets bugged from the clock getting out of sync you effectively can't play it anymore. No items respawn, no shop updates, quests dont progress, crops don't grow. It completely ruins the game and from what I've gathered from other players the devs have said it isn't a priority for them to fix because ""time traveling"" is cheating. Okay. So I paid for a product that you're telling me can break beyond repair at any time? What else might cause this issue. It rubs me the wrong way. I bought the collectors edition because I believed in the game and that was a slap in the face. One thing I will say is that the star path (battle pass) items and my collectors edition items were still on my account when I restarted my file. If that wasn't the case I'd have quit then and there so at least there's that. But word to the wise: make sure if you play this on Switch or another computer that the time is always current time or you could end up with a broken save file and no recourse. 

In my new save file I have since worked myself back up to where I was before and then some. I recollected all of the store items, finished most of the quests again, and used this new file to be more efficient and overall get more enjoyment out of the game. I didn't regret my decision to restart because the daily joy the game brought was worth working for everything again. This was until the most recent patch and their introduction of the cash shop. 

Players have been asking for new hairstyles, clothes, and furniture items for months as long time players have cleared out what they can purchase from the in game shop. I've now seen more new items in the cash shop that only rotates once every 5 days than I have seen in my in-game store for months. Logging onto the game every day to check my shop for items is one of the only things I log in for after finishing any new patch's given content. It keeps me interested. Instead they're asking 10-25 dollars for an item pack of 4 furniture items? In what world does this make sense? That's a high price even if we all weren't struggling with inflation currently. The Star Path which served as this game's battle pass used to let you gain items of this quality for just playing the game. It would even refund most of the paid coins you used to unlock the Star Path if you finished it. No longer. The quality of the items offered has gone down and the return on paid currency has been reduced as well. They attempted to compensate for this by increasing a daily premium currency reward from 10 to 50 but I honestly think that right there speaks for itself. All of their loyal players were gathering 1/5th of what they consider a daily allotment of paid currency since the game came out. The lack of consideration for their loyal players is confusing. 

Overall this game was my comfort game for many months and nothing will take that away. Even through restarting and catching back up I found myself thankful this game existed. There's a lot of love and passion woven into the world, characters, animations and storylines. That's why it's so heartbreaking to see that magic squandered by an incredibly greedy monetization strategy that tells the average player not looking to open their wallet every week that they aren't worth everything the game has to offer. To be fair we all knew this was the goal from the beginning and games do have to make money. I just didn't expect them to bungle it this badly. Here's hoping they listen to feedback going forward so the game can be just as magical and accessible for all.

Instead the content updates are very few and far between, seemingly not too caring of what the players think (might be my biased opinion). Implemented are 'major-transaction' cash shop with multiple FOMO tactics in the form of..
	1. non-recurring Star Paths (bought reward tracks for you to work through every 2 months or so) ; 
	2. very expensive weekly Premium Shop (that will probably rotate items back eventually, like some actual 'free to play' games do) ; 
	3. daily login bonus (that gives next to nothing to allow any premium shop items, and makes you work in even getting it) ; 
	4. and a whole bunch of mechanics on different timers (discussions with characters ; critter spawns ; Scrooge's item shop ; etc.) just to push the daily interaction of players, resulting more player retention 
	..and more invested the players are, more likely they are to keep coming back to see the cash shop and spend an exuberant amount of money on tiny additions. 
	
The game itself is somewhat okay to play, but it will probably forever be in the shadow of other games in this genre. If you are (or have been) in interest of games like Animal Crossing (AC), then Dreamlight Valley (DV) can provide the same fun factor for a while - especially with its nice Disney artstyle and charm ; and also it being a new addition, bringing that 'new game excitement' that seemingly a lot of people are giving praise to this game for (them either not having better past experiences, or just delusional for what this game really is).

After a few weeks in, working through the daily tasks, progressing the 'story', and finishing a Star Path, it comes apparent on how little this game actually offers and how it operates on dumb modern 'game as a service' grind. Some examples:
	1. Want to craft a balloon arch to decorate a small area of a single path? Go hit rocks and gather other materials for an hour or two. 
	2. Want to progress the fantastic Story? Here's 10 meaningless back-and-forth fetch quests that culminates with a group activity (concert/show/feast/..) that happens, but doesn't actually happen (fade to black - here's your cosmetic reward). 
	3. Star Paths are surely there to spice up the gameplay experience, right? Nope. Just 50 additional fetch quests (most of which can be done in a day or two if you've already played the game for a while, and built up supplies, with some 'duties' that can take up to 5 days of 'discussions' to be had), that is purely forced in just to have a cosmetic pass in this game. 
	4. What if I missed any Star Path items? Well that’s just too bad. If you don't have a time machine, then you'll just have to have all these digital files installed on your machine, that we conveniently locked you out of, just to punish the non-active / non-timely / no-paying customer base. 
	5. Scrooge's item shop will surely have lots of fun items to decorate the island with, right? Yeah, you get a couple items every day. How about that Corner Cupboard reskin #37, or a L-couch reskin #56? Oof, you just spent 20k gold coins on a duplicate again.. well that's sad. Better go farm more pumpkins buddy.
	6. At least it is a modern game, that improves on the genre? Nah.. can't have  game saves ; can't replay the story ; cloud saves are nice to transission between multiple play machines (but have made people lost their saves without proper backup system) ; lacking tons of expected 'quality of life' features (oh so many games to take good examples from) ; and my personal pet peeve - the game engine can do Ultrawide just fine, but doesn't support it (so in 8 months a dev team hasn't enabled something that probably took a day at most for a modder to do, so I always have to run this game with a 'fix'). 

Only thing I can praise DV for is its 'build mode', which is nice to use, but the game has limitations on placed item amounts, and just doesn't have the item variety and interactivity that AC:NH has -a 3 y/o game that has none of the predatory and FOMO tactics DV has, and is more fun in every single way. For a parent looking at these reviews, my recommendation is buying your kid a Switch and a AC:NH copy instead (or just Sims with all its major packs) - with how Gameloft will try and squeeze its playerbase, it will save you money in the long run. DV being made into a 'free' game also doesn't guarantee its survivability in the future if the Disney overlords decide to shut this project down.

I've given DV a lot of my time and feedback, and I really wanted it to be better (and hopefully there's enough QoL fixes in the future to at least improve it), but I have a gut feeling that it will just stay as another milking machine. If you play this game, then seek out trainers to make the game more enjoyable ; make manual backups ; and DO NOT feed it any more money if you've already bought into the 'Ultimate' experience (something that apparently is worth a single Star Path and 1-2 weeks of Premium shop items).

Streamers perspective:
as always comments are turned off to prevent trolls.
this review will get updated as the game  gets updated.

Love the game:
New updates, some are good some, i don't like.
they most likely are there so people don't dead end their game until new content comes out.
(yeah right like that not gonna happen for hard core players)

They patched alot of the bugs, so that's nice.
but the game still needs sum( well alot really) polishing in the custom content department:
a few building aspects need to be addressed but i suspect they will be addressed once (all the main character arcs are out)
having the avatar tool camera is great. but id still like to design character houses and hold character photo shoots.
(could fine tune that camera movement after all its a magical camera)
  
hearing/reading characters for like the 4,000th time has gotten a bit stale.
the fact they removed some SFX is actually great( it optimized the game)
unlocking some of the collectibles is a bit irritating.
The frozen game glitchs are annoying in the next patch they should come out with a 
Quest Replay 
(its a memory style replay, you pick a character, hit relieve story and you have two options, 
re collect materials or watch dialog and cut-scences

also let my buddies do some of the work form me,
 
i don't want to spend 3 hours mining gold/ gems( let the Disney 7 dwarfs do it){ Disney joke BTW)
(a certain little robot can tend to my lands gardens for me.)
(also let the NPC's have inventory space to pick up and hand you the extra stuff in a gift box. with dialog box)
(also have them repeat my actions behind me so they stop getting in my way.)
Kristoffs shop needs a  unlimited gold ore/ silver ore(or just make 7 dwarfs shop)
( my town is going to require over 4k in gold bars... i don't want to have to hand mine that)
also allow me to supply Remy with daily supplies and get paid for cooking for characters in exchange for gold lol

Have gardeners have a seeding ability so when you hand em seeds in a area of the map they fill the holes dug.
Also you should introducing a cooking with friends (yes it will require 2 stoves/ingredients and level up)
(so no matter who you are hanging cooking gives you extra meals)

I love the  daylight and night time adjust, but it i like to control time in games with time)
the real time aspect is still a bit of a problem area, i play video games to escape real times,
( i like to have a better world then the one i live in  most of the time ha-ha.)

The new chest system is awesome( but polish it so you can break down old chests for materials, also  house storage items should be upgraded as long as you provide a fixer character materials AND GOLD)
clothing currently doesn't take up space but they could make so a wardrobe can act like a permanent filter.
(hide stuff in the magical wardrobe so when you change on the go you don't see stuff, you don't change into lol)
(its magical storage after all)
i LOVE THE DOOR FRAME/ WALLS UPDATE NEED WE JUST NEED THE CEILINGS,
AND WINDOWS( SHOW WHATS INSIDE A ROOM OR ON THE OUTSIDE LOL)
I'm not a fan of the map decoration limited count space.

The premier shop is kind meh
but its still early yet.
Disney would never put this in but kind make jokes about it. but i make romance jokes,
but i would like to see something that has to do with your character and romance.


it's an absolutely perfect great game except for the areas that still need work.

if you have the money definitely get the best founders pack.
SEVERAL DDV PLAYERS DON'T HAVE TIME TO GRIND.
I think in the future Disney should hold some event days
where cool stuff of the past appears and is reduced dramatic costs

Not to mention it's pretty predatory (I mean it's literally kid cartoon characters parading around in $10 outfits) and janky. It looks pretty, sure, from a certain angle but it's extremely unpolished, and it's in dire need of some quality of life updates, such as inventory management, bulk cooking and selling, improved context menus and follower pathfinding (don't even think of bringing Maui anywhere) and collisions, and a LOT of bug fixes.

 It seems for every one thing they add, there's about a hundred bugs they create. But ultimately there's very little interactivity with things, and very little replayability. Yes there's Disney characters and they all have their own animations and stuff (You can hear Donald from a mile away thanks to his aggressive stomping animation) but you can't really interact with objects, which is ridiculous considering the game expects you to pay premium prices for some of them, having now introduced even MORE ways to sponge your money off of you. Give this one a miss. Just play an old Animal Crossing game, it's basically what this is, only with Disney characters instead of cats and dogs and stuff.

It is largely agreed upon by many members of their discord that the prices of the premium store is outrageous, with no evidence that they are listening to player feedback. 

The premium shop runs on a varied timer ranging from 5-7 days. The first batch of premium drops costed roughly $50, didn't have any option to buy any of the items individually (bundles of three items each) and rotated put after five days. The second batch was about half the price, but datamined evidence shows that this was probably just coincidence, as most of the prices were datamined with the items themselves with large fluctuations up and down.

Aside from the rather overpriced premium shop, despite the backlash Gameloft has been practically silent on the whole thing. Many of us want them to respond, to know they've seen our concerns, but instead we've only been cornered off into one section of their discord server and restricted to 6 hour message timers.

I agree with the comparisons to Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, and personally I love that this game has everything I wanted for AC. Clear quests and objectives that you don't [i] need [/i] to do, but makes gameplay so much more fun if you do. I also started off with just the base game, but loved it enough to buy the upgrade to Ultimate Edition :)

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*] free movement placement of literally everything, from houses to bushes and trees and even the teleportation wells
[*] VAST ingredients and meals to cook with them + cooking meals for characters both in restaurant and for gifts
[*] plenty of fishing spots + a much more relaxed fishing style than AC and SD.
[*] the only limit on gardening is space and your wallet
[*] incredibly well-balanced friendship levels, it's not too easy or hard to get characters to level 10 without some dedication
[*] gold coins aren't a massive pain to farm for ³(farm pumpkins endgame w/ at least a few characters at level 10 Gardening)
[*] ""battle pass"" is easy enough to catch up on, I started the Christmas one with 7 days left and I finished with 37 hours remaining without stress or worry
[*] I wish resource spawns were faster but then they'd be pretty game breaking, they're honestly fine where they are
[*] little things like interacting with the critters adds to the immersion SO MUCH
[*] there aren't many clothes/accessories in the game I don't like
[*] watching classic Disney characters interact with present day characters is such a feeling [spoiler] (Ariel and WALL-E trading human ""artifacts"", Kristoff and Donald Duck working together to save the forest etc.) [/spoiler]
[*] nighttime looks just as pretty as daytime in it's own way. honestly. go appreciate the plaza at midnight. I'll wait.
[*] Dreamlight isn't hard to farm for either. You could focus on gardening, or fishing, or mining, or doing the 6 ""daily"" quests that just give you another when you complete one, or a mixture of everything! I unlocked all realms (currently 5) in the castle and all biomes (currently 6 not including the meadow) on the map within >60 hours of [strike] grinding [/strike] gameplay
[*] having companions give you extra fish/resources/crops is 👌 very nice
[*] ² the clothing in this game is so fun, it's a bit limiting w/ only being able to purchase x pieces a day but it all gets added to your catalogue & it's fun dressing up as a glamorous princess or the most random creature in existence
[*] ⁶I love some of the details added for the characters. Stitch hates water, and every time it's raining I see him in his house on the map. Idk if this was intentional but if it was then gg the devs [b]CARE[/b] about this game. I also love how the characters are obtained in some really unique ways, like finding Mirabel's doorknob or finding 3 missing socks over 10 days to unlock Stitch
[*] ⁷literally the fact they added different sized chests for the players after reading the feedback. I mean they were probably going to add them anyways, but they also added Sort and Smart Stack as well as a priority so I'd like to think the devs really are listening to us
[/list]


[h1] Cons: [/h1] (all bugs resulted in a force close)
[list]
[*] [strike]BUG: get stuck leaving my house (most common)[/strike]
[*] [strike]BUG: once lost all controls/no buttons worked[/strike]
[*] [strike]BUG: once had Maui conversation bug where the conversation menu was still up but conversation was over, unable to move or exit[/strike]
[*] [strike]I WISH WE HAD MORE INVENTORY SPACE RIGHT OFF THE BAT WE COLLECT SO MUCH STUFF AND THERE'S LIKE NO STORAGE. I have 8+ chests I crafted and they have 2 rows of space but show they have up to 6 or 8 or something? CAN I UPGRADE THEM PLEASE 🥺[/strike] ¹they've added small/medium/large chests to the game and I can hoard peacefully now 🙏
[*] ⁴I wish there wasn't an in-game shop for premium currency, but I understand the devs need to make money back once the game goes FTP. Still sick of seeing microtransactions in video games though but unfortunately I doubt my one will review will stop them 😂
[*] ⁵the fact that there even is a ""battle pass"" event (FOMO hitting me bad after finding out I missed 2 events by the time I bought the game)
[/list]

so yea all in all I think DDLV is a pretty good game 👍

EDITS:
- overall formatting fix
- strikethrough the BUG's under Cons as they seem to have all been patched

1. The Battle Pass (Star Path in game) isn't special nor ""Premium"" quality. The majority of the BP is ""motifs"" which are stickers you can use to customize clothes. They sell furniture and clothing in the Premium Store instead of including it in the BP when it's very obvious that it is meant to fit the theme of the BP (meaning they're intentionally putting trash in the BP so they can make money in the Premium Store instead).
2. Additionally, it's a massive red flag when there's a Premium Store before they even finished the story and before they fixed all the bugs.
3. The Premium Store is absolutely predatory FOMO bs. Items may or may not come back, the rotation is a weekly duration, and in order to collect all of the items they sell in the Premium Store (which is all bundles as you cannot get singular items), you would need to drop $50-$100 dollars which is just not feasible.
4. The exchange amount of money to acquire moonstone is honestly awful ($5 for 1200 Moonstones, $10 for 2500 Moonstones, $20 for 5500 Moonstones. This is important to know because the Premium Store will sell one bundle for anywhere between 3000-6000 Moonstones. That means if you wanted to get one bundle, you have to pay $20. Imagine if you want to get ALL four). Please keep in mind that the rotation of items is WEEKLY (meaning you could be shelling out $80-$100 a week and $400 a month on this game)
4. They have refused to listen to their discord community in regards to the feedback regarding the Premium Store. 

DO NOT encourage this behavior in the game industry. While I am happy for you if you make enough money to be able to purchase these items, the behavior behind this model is harmful for children and incredibly predatory.

but to little content
1 update in 2 months
and not even using that iconic disney charachters 
to much holes still in the game you can never fill
and to many bugs
maybe later i make a better / new review when there is more
update 3 they put a pay to win in the game
future the game will be free and more payed contense and pay to win
Not what i sighed up for when i payed for the game

well if you want to talk tommyphany {developer} i use to really test games for bigger companies then gameloft and o.k my english (im dutch) isnt perfect i could always get my idears and what i see / observe over in ways the company could stil understand 
and im really direct like bug in maribels house can't exit (kind of fixed after reset of the sae game) 
sugestion put in more missions and give players once a day 1 they can skip for the coins  you can collect for the event 
or stuff like the moonstone shop at the end of the event give a few day so players can buy items they missed earlyer on
and stop with the money part in the game ppl have payed for it 
now it feels like you use ppl as free testers and idear givers 
like you dont have any more idears then the start / basis of the game
and hope the community will come up with idears you can use
feels unfair to pay premium pricing for a game that will be free in the future 
and then still have to pay money to do all things (while its ment for all ages and children dont have money for all the stuff)
and you got obsessive players like me who want all items but kind of refuse to pay more for a game that would be a complete game when its finaly done (so then you can expect that it means you get all thing in it on a fair and avalible way not pay to skin your house or clothing furniture or other nonsense)
esspeciallyif you know there hacked versions you can get online where all the special items are a standard feature and free of money costs (so fast yeas already so fast)
and still i chose to pay for the game and for paying you get rewarded with ....
more paying!

No answers means this will remain a negative review. Transparency is desired. The negative review remains until we have more answers.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

We were promised that Dreamlight Valley was going to be treated like Fortnite: charges for cosmetics and premiums that won't impact our gameplay.

Now we're being told that items and characters are going to be locked under paid currency. When we ask for details like if these items are ever going to be available in shop, we don't get many answers... Which is troubling when we find out some of the items are already available in game...

Considering we're paying to do this early access and squash bugs for the devs, this seems a little shifty to me.

I wouldn't mind paying for cosmetics and a few special furniture sets, but this is ridiculous and nobody's giving out comprehensive answers.

While the star paths offer you an early chance at furniture, it's also a heavy reminder you might get those pieces of furniture later in the shop... Which some people have already found them. So it doesn't feel like a good incentive. Besides, you really don't get a good value for your money. It's $9 USD to purchase some of the most sought after items... I can do much better with other mobile games.

So how much will those currency-locked characters be? I want answers that I'm not getting.

And for this early access, these bite-sized ""updates"" are nothing. With very little playtime, you complete them and have to wait two months to ""playtest"" the next ""bite"". While I haven't found any glitches (and lucky me) there's really no incentive to play or help report bugs when things are dropped like this. There is no game to play. There's no large sections to complete for hours at a time so I can actually keep pushing this game and see some real glitches in action to report on them.

If you're thinking about it, this was a promising game. It can still be a promising game. I'd like to change this review because honestly, for a ""cozy"" game, it's a little easier to play and more accessible. You're not ruining your hands trying to play an over-complicated fishing mini game and decorating is, honestly, much more friendly and inviting. But the devs would rather cling to mobile style gaming and go back on their original plans. Don't do it until current problems are resolved. If they are never resolved, don't be duped like we were.",1677022576,1677095610,False,10,0,0.563882350921630859,0,True,False,True

I will no longer recommend this pure, micro-transaction game disguised as a 'happy fun Disney-themed farming game' to anyone. Developers and producers, 'Gameloft', who are notorious for mobile gaming apps, have clearly recycled their business model from the previously overpriced and badly reviewed 'Disney Magic Kingdom' game.

The gameplay revolves around completing quests and ultimately expanding on your collection of Disney and Pixar themed clothing, furniture and motifs. Most of these items can be purchased in the Scrooge shop using in-game gold currency, which is easily obtained by selling the fruit and veg you grow, the gems you mine, the flowers you pick, etc etc. It is all obtainable without spending a penny or a dime of real money. To some, this style of gameplay is already repetitive, but to those who enjoy the likes of Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon, the farming and collectors element is fun and relaxing. Admittedly, I had 141 hours of fun unlocking characters, opening new bio-domes, completing quests and joining the seasonal starpaths.

However, now that Gameloft's true agenda with this game has been revealed to their early access customers (an agenda that goes against their own support site for DDV), I would happily uninstall and request a refund, if only that were possible. Instead, I await Gameloft's response. After all, over 140 customers expressed negative feedback to the premium store, and I am proudly one of them. These micro-transaction-focused games need to STOP, especially when they prey on younger audiences (this is both a game for kids and adults alike, or ""the young at heart"") and those who have addictive personalities or suffer from FOMO. 

No pixels are worth paying $50-80 extra a month for. That is the cost of an entirely new game and yet, that is the target Gameloft are aiming for with their obscene premium prices. As a business model, it's truly laughable, and also unethical. Are these companies truly that out of touch with reality? 

Note that the game is still 'early access' and therefore not free-to-play (and won't ever actually be free-to-play either). It is still littered with bugs, and the story is far from complete. Seems Gameloft are far more concerned about launching and perfecting their micro-transactions though.

Outrageous and disgusting.

It's got the usual farming, fishing, mining (as well as foraging and digging) - and the fishing is about the most challenging aspect of the entire game, but simple enough for anyone to master.

I've seen a few people online complaining about the in-game monetisation / micro-transactions.
Do remember that it's a going to be a free-to-play title in the future (in early access at the time of this review), and in order for the development team to continue to put out updates, they need a revenue stream.
None of the micro-transactions are ""pay-to-win"", but purely cosmetic, and you can have a fun time without spending a cent - Your money, your choice.

Overall, I've spent more time in this game than expected, and I'll keep coming back for a laid-back experience in the beautiful world of Dreamlight Valley.",1676833633,1677006342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

What many of us have feared knowing that the studio behind it, Gameloft who is known for mobile games, is unfortunately starting to show it's self. For those of us who read their FAQ about the games monetization in the future, we knew it was going to have micro-transactions. We know that there will be paid dlc after the game is out of EA. They said there won't be any pay to win or pay to skip shenanigans. There aren't any yet. Sounds good right? Not so fast. With the most recent update they rolled out their premium shop. It's all just cosmetic. But it's outrageously expensive!

The most expensive moonstone (premium currency) pack is $50 usd for 14,500 . The cost of 1 house skin and 9 furnishings (3 furnishing bundles that include 3 each) is a total of 15,005 moonstones. Of course you aren't require to buy all of them. If you're Looking at getting just one you still have to pay $20 for 5500 moonstones because they are priced 3k-4.8k moonstones. One of the furnishing sets is higher than the castle house skin cost. Oh by the way these items are on a 5 day buying window when then the items in the premium shop refresh with new items, creating FOMO. To be fair you can earn free moonstones for free each day, but only 50 from the chest. 1500 moonstones in 30 days. That no where near comes close to offsetting the cost of these items, especially considering it's on a 5 day reset. This is on top of already having the star path (battle pass) which many consider pretty lack luster.

I'm not hating on them for wanting to support their game once it goes free to play on it's official release. But this is outrageous. They need to include a lot more items for the price or lower the price by a LOT. Even if they halved the price it would still be a bit steep for me. I would not be surprised if it was planned to hike the prices from the start so they look good when they lower it. Which is dumb because they already had good will with their community

I'll revisit this after we see if they make changes

Edit for Feb 21/23:Oh boy... Alright, well we got the next round of items. They upped the refresh time to 7 days instead of 5, Still creates FOMO though. They did lower the prices. It's 1 step in the right direction but, still a bit much for what you get in my opinion. The quality of the items this time are pretty meh. They don't have any aspect to them that looks like a 'premium item.' They look like other stuff you'd get from scrooge's shop... Which hilariously leads me into the next part. As soon as the new items appeared in the shop players in the DDLV discord server noticed that 2 of the item bundles contained items you can already get at scrooges shop.... YES, you read that right. They were trying to sell players items that were already in the game. They did pull those 2 bundles from the shop after a bit and said they'd issue refunds for them. I am leaving my review as not- recommended until they 1) give a good apology from even trying to start this overpriced cash shop while in Early Access while others are still experiencing terrible bugs. 2) show they can run a fair and competent cash shop.",1676633411,1677000548,False,21,0,0.55055701732635498,0,True,False,True

Last update added a Premium shop, that uses ONLY moonstones, which are quite rare to get. 

I have 177h of gameplay behind me, yet had to go search for moonstone chests (drop 50 moonstones, can find maybe 3 of them in a day, IF lucky) to be able to buy ONE of the cheaper premiums. 
Funnily the most expensive one has only a castle skin for your house, whether three others have three things
1: bed, table and lamp. 
2:Chair, wall decor and art showcase. 
3:Bedside table, plant and armchair. 

Prices wary from 3 040 to 3 750. 
To get these four bundles, you'd need about 14 000 moonstones. 
That would be 50$/€ and leave you with at least 500 extra.

Oh, did I mention the Premium shop changes every 7 days. 
We don't yet know if unbought items circle back or not.

-Love the character customization options, plus you can change your look any time you'd like for free!
-Characters all look amazing + true to the ""Disney"" style, and their animations make them feel more real. Plus it gives me nostalgia every time I see them and makes me want to watch Disney movies 
-It's easy to farm resources and doesn't give me the ""grindy"" feeling to get what I need for crafting or quests 
-You can use the shops any time of the day and not just on certain days/times!!! 
-Multiple elements in the game: fishing, gardening, cooking, mining, crafting, feeding critters, foraging, digging- giving you more things to discover and collect, and figuring out the best place/time/area to get certain things
-Interacting with characters has a purpose/benefit; as you level them up (hang out with them more) they will give you more materials for that activity
-You are not limited to daily tasks, you get new tasks automatically after completing one, so you can farm as much Dreamlight as you'd like to
-Not restricted to daily stamina or time: if you run out of energy, you can simply go back home or eat food to refill it. In other games I've played (Stardew and Animal Crossing) you are limited to getting everything done before the day resets in game, which can be stressful and limiting at times
-Very interesting and engaging plot: I actually get excited uncovering more memories and exploring new areas or meeting characters. Everything ties together nicely and I am excited to see where it goes!
-Free content updates!!! This is a huge one, as I originally thought you'd have to pay for DLC to unlock new characters or areas
-Optional micro-transactions: you can still partake in events without having to buy a battle pass. Upgrading your pass just unlocks more tasks to complete it faster. The only things you may want to spend real-life money on is optional cosmetics, but you can slowly earn the premium currency daily (and I feel like there's already enough free clothing/furniture without having to buy them with premium currency)
-Very communicative and involved community management. Their team is very responsive to people's requests, bug reports, and questions. I appreciate how transparent the team is with their goals and road maps; and it is nice to see developers care so much about their players!
-All of the content!!! It sounds a bit silly, but I am so used to games nowadays being released unfinished, where you have to pay $60 for DLC to finish the story later. This game is in still Early Access and there is so much to do! I only paid $23 for this game and have already played for 70 hours, but I still have characters/realms to unlock, areas on the map to unlock, quests to finish, and collections to complete. I haven't even begun to decorate my village yet
-adding onto the previous point ^ how easy it is to decorate/re-arrange things in your village! You can move literally anything; houses, plants, paths, wells, items- all for free and it's very simple to do. I was originally very cautious about where I placed Villager houses, but once I saw how quickly you could move them, I was relieved. Also, you don't have to be standing right in front of something to move it, you can zoom out and place things wherever you'd like, and the mechanic is very user-friendly

[b]However[/b] 

TL/DR The events will cost you hundreds of real dollars  if you really want all the event stuff. So, avoid the game if you're big on collecting ALL ITEMS. 

The events, the ones with moonstone, insanely overpriced. But it's Disney, they don't know how not to force you to pay exorbitant amounts of money for subpar clothing items, decals, and furniture packs. Around 4,000 moonstone for three small furniture items is ridiculous. 

Some of the dialogue is obnoxious and repetitive after a while. Having to start a chat with someone every day and saying the same things is very droll. I also cannot stand how when interacting with certain characters for the first time you are forced to say the equivalent of ""I'm such a huge fan omg omg"" to them, Whereas in other instances you actually have dialogue choices that are harsh, entertainingly so. 

Also, a small gripe I have, i wish there was a way to ask players to go back to their world. I get it, the point is to fill the realm with them, but it's [i]my[/i] Dreamlight valley and in [i]MY[/i] dream world there would be [b]NO ELSA[/b]. she is obnoxious. In general, I find sometimes the place gets cluttered with people and their houses take up way too much space.

[b] The Good, The Bad, The Downright Awful [/b]

[b] The Good: Fun gameplay, seemingly responsive devs, minimal issues (on PC) for an early access game. [/b]

This game is a cross between the decoration/farming aspects of Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the farming aspects of Stardew Valley and other life sims, but with some decent QoL features. On the PC version (here on Steam), and coming from playing ACNH, the decorating features are incredible. There are a few bugs and glitches here and there, which is to be expected from a game in early access, and the devs seem to be fairly responsive in addressing player feedback for in-game issues. For instance, coal is a core item received from mining, used for cooking, smelting ore into bars, and crafting other odds and ends. You get around 1-2 pieces of coal per mining node, and you can mine infinitely all day long (provided you keep up with your energy/stamina by eating in game), but to get a full stack of coal (99 pieces), you'd have to farm only ore nodes for at least two hours. In the most recent patch (as of this review), devs added infinite amounts of coal purchasable from one of the in-game shops. 

[b] The Bad: The in-game economy is grindy, and is in desperate need of a total overhaul. [/b]

Continuing with my previous example of coal and mining, I'll use the example of crafting some lamp posts in the game. Ideally, most people would place lamp posts all over their Valley for decoration, as the game revolves around decoration. One lamp post takes, among other ingredients, two iron bars. One iron bar takes 10 pieces of iron ore and 1 piece of coal - so, 20 iron ores and 2 coals for one lamp post. One iron node, from what I can tell, drops anywhere between 1 and 5 pieces of iron (and if you have a companion with you, you may or may not get an extra piece of iron ore). If you wanted to make 10 lamp posts, you would need to make 20 iron bars, which requires 200 pieces of iron ore. Do the math - you'd have to do a LOT of farming ONLY the nodes which drop iron to get enough iron for these lamp posts. Not to mention the other ingredients - glass requires sand (similarly frustrating to farm; apparently when you dig on the beach, there is a chance that you won't get any sand at all ?? what am I digging???), and the light itself requires gems. 

Anyway, be prepared to do a LOT of farming to get your Valley decorated in early access... or settle for understanding you will only be able to decorate small parts at a time. 

[b] The Downright Awful: The premium store is ridiculously overpriced. [/b]

The ""end game"" for this game is two main things: finishing the quests and decorating your Valley/house. Everything you do in the game (outside of the quests) is to enable you to decorate - the shops sell furniture, the food you cook can be used to decorate, the quests you do often give you furniture, the resources you farm are there to help craft furniture... and so on. The game is currently planned to be free-to-play once it is out of early access. 

Recently, the premium store was released (which is a weird move, to be honest). The in-game currency you purchase with real money is Moonstones. You can earn 50 Moonstones per day for free by opening a chest that spawns once a day. 

In the premium store, one of three furnishing packages were for sale, and one ""skin"" to turn your house into a castle was available. Each of these four packages cost 2,000-3,000+ Moonstones to purchase. If you wanted to get them for ""free,"" you'd have to play for MONTHS and only settle for one of those four packages. Otherwise, you'd have to pay... unfortunately, 2k-3k Moonstones comes out to $15-25. Also, the premium store rotates every 5 days... and each furniture pack only contains 3 pieces of furniture. So in order to be able to collect every piece of furniture available in the premium store, you'd need to be ready to spend hundreds of dollars a month. 

[b] My Conclusion: Not Worth It. [/b]

The game is fun. I have 108 hours on it on PC, and twice as much on Switch. Its gameplay is promising. However, even with my hundreds of hours in the game, I have not been able to fully decorate a single area to my liking because farming the necessary resources is an ABYSMAL chore (and it has been for a WHILE, yet the devs are mysteriously slow to respond to the in-game economy). When the premium store launched with outrageous prices, I decided I would not ever recommend this game to anyone. You'll get addicted, but you'll ultimately be sad and disappointed. 

For the $200-300 you'd have to spend for a month on this game, you could pick up almost a dozen indie life sims and have thousands of hours of fun, and far less frustration. Don't bother.",1676873057,1676873057,False,16,0,0.515615522861480713,0,True,False,True

The game is not aimed at children. What child would enjoy finding a clue and then waiting 5 days to find another or waiting 3 days for a seed to grow.

Feeding the animals. The squirrels are cute, Playing chase with the rabbits and foxes is fun and the birds are are very sweet. The crocs and the raccoons are impossible to feed they just run away. If you want to complete the set be prepared to set your alarm because they only come out at set times and some are in the middle of the night i.e. the white squirrel comes out between midnight and 6am on Sunday mornings.

The Star Path.  This is like a battle pass and I am on the forth one. The first one  had really good rewards, a nice cars bed, a mcqueen  jacket and a motorcycle were just some of them.  Now it looks like like you will only find this sort of thing in the newly introduced ""shop"" this where you spend your VBucks (oops sorry) moonstones on the cool items that are no longer in the star path and the grindy quests mostly just give you motifs to put on a Tshirt

Fishing and mining are the staple diet of this game, they make it easy to earn enough to buy what you need quite quickly but the rest of the game is grindy and you spend a lot of time just waiting and waiting and waiting. Waiting for certain flowers to grow, waiting for mining spots to respawn. waiting for crops to grow.

To sum up it looks like like this game is on the downward slope, it gets worse with each update and is heading for a play to win type game.

Let's go back a bit. When this game launched, a lot of us? We got excited. We got hyped. Because what we saw was another game where we got to be comfy, we got to hang out with the characters we loved from the Disney franchise, we got to live in this vibrant little world the devs crafted. And honestly, it looked promising at first, and it even looked like the devs were taking feedback into consideration in the early access period. But like any dream, that dream fades.

After a while, you start to notice the proverbial cracks in the paint. A faulty texture here, a misaligned texture there, a few glitches... and then you start to notice that the game is mechanically unsound as well. Switch users saw it first, with the game being somewhat poor in its optimization, but everyone else soon followed, seeing glitch after glitch after glitch, failures in optimization, characters phasing through walls or sticking up out of the ground even after the developers claimed to ""Fix"" these problems, missing collision meshes in the world, and the longer you look, the more it begins to feel like the whole thing is held together with duct tape and broken dreams, and the honeymoon starts to fade.

And then the devs introduce patch that fixes none of these problems, but DOES add in... micro-transactions. The game's not even out of early access, it's not even in the ""Freemium"" stage yet, and they're already holding out their hand saying ""More money please"". And as red flags go, that's a pretty huge one. 

Even just prior to this, the mood in the game's official discord was very much in the realm of ""Who cares"" when the new update was announced. On launch, update excitement was Extremely high, people were eager to see what was next, and now.... they just aren't. Sure, there's Some excitement from some, but long time players are approaching it with an attitude of ""Yeeeeeah, that magic's passed"". So many of the in-game quests feel like busy work, like things you'll spend days on just to collect enough of a certain random dropping resource, and altogether the game just feels like it doesn't respect your time. Which, again, wouldn't be so bad in this early access period if the devs hadn't dedicated their time, instead of rebalancing these quests and fixing some of these pretty gross visual bugs, to building out a system to try and pull money from a player base who has, by entirety, already paid.  

Honestly? I'm disappointed. I'm not Surprised, this is pretty typical of Gameloft's entire business model, but all I see here is yet more proof that Disney should think twice before souring their brand by licensing out to game studios who put profit before experience, and who can't even be bothered to spend the time to clean up the fringe lines on a texture in photoshop.

Whilst Dreamlight Valley is an okay game, with similar gameplay to games like Animal Crossing, everything you do is basically a chore to earn dreamlight.   You'll be endlessly wacking rocks for gems,  farming trees for fruit and eventually cook with Remy,  this loop is basically the entire game - farm to raise crops such as Pumpkins to make hundreds of thousands which allows you to quickly upgrade your town,  raise crops to complete food requests then its down to crafting for the various characters you'll meet and some of the tasks are pretty obnoxious which take days,  real time days because the game exists in real time and you cannot time skip without risking the entire game breaking. 

Because of the real time aspects, many characters are only awake at certain hours so for some people it can be frustrating to meet and finish tasks for people,  not to mention some of the friendship quests have fairly ridiculous requirements,  often requiring notoriously limited resources like Iron and Hard wood which have resorted in some people taking drastic measures to farm reliably.

Disney Dreamlight Valley is the epitome of ""Live services'  with a entry fee at $30 and has typical events that cost moonstones which is the games premium currency and usually weighs in at $10 to $15 to unlock the star path premium route, whilst you could argue that you get 'some' moonstones back for completing the event. 

They also added the cash shop which as you could expect is filled with a plethora of cosmetic items once again at $10+ per item, some costing much more and as I said again,  this was to be expected from a live service,  the thing is - this game is basically entirely single player with the possibility of any multiplayer at a later  date and at most it'll be similar to Animal Crossing inviting people to your 'world' type of multiplayer, I cannot see anything more than that happening. 

The character generation is okay, nothing special but does feature a pretty extensive array of clothing options for every taste.   Whilst I wouldn't say the game is horrible, its early access and has many options limited with could get better with time...maybe,  but definitely remember this is a live service and I expect this aspect to get worse over time.   The video and gameplay clips make the game appear much bigger and brighter than it really is, the areas are exceptionally small to a point you could across an entire biome in less than 30 seconds.",1676684744,1676684986,False,6,1,0.56402134895324707,0,True,False,True

Gameplay wise, its a bit buggy,  but is a pleasing mix of Stardew valley and animal crossing.  If done by another company, it could be a huge hit, and honestly it still probably will, but gameloft is too greedy to not focus solely on the whales, and free-to-play or low spenders wont have as great of time.

I hate to leave a negative review but in light of recent events, and having received no update from Gameloft thus far after MASSIVE BACKLASH from players, I CANNOT recommend the game in its current state. 

The most recent update prioritised the addition of a premium shop over bug fixes - I cannot stress enough, this game is not in its Free 2 Play state at this time, nor is it a bug free experience. There are still many players experiencing game-breaking bugs where they lose items they received after PAYING for the game. 

The addition of the premium store has proved problematic due to the sheer AUDACITY of the prices (£50 for approx 10 furniture items and one house skin) and the predatory / scummy tactics being utilised:

1.  The 2 least expensive moonstone packages are not enough to even make ONE purchase from the premium store. You'd have to purchase the next highest package... and in doing so, you would have leftover moonstones that wouldn't be enough to buy anything from the store. 
2. The store rotates every 5 days, encouraging FOMO pressure-selling.
3. This update's Star Path was lacklustre compared to previous Star Paths BECAUSE items that were supposed to be a part of the Star Path were lifted and dropped into the premium store instead (and this is something we're supposed to pay for too)

I realise that these sort of premium stores are not unusual in the gaming industry (sadly) but dropping £20 to buy a mount on a MMO is different to dropping £20 for a furniture item on DDLV. This is a game that is ALL ABOUT collecting items and decorating.

I am all for supporting developers. I bought the ultimate edition of this game on Nintendo Switch and the standard edition on PC. The premium store hasn't come as a surprise, but the complete disconnect between cost and worth has left a really bad taste in my mouth. I'm not willing to continue supporting money-grabbing, whale-hunting tactics. 

I won't be changing this review unless there is a response from Gameloft addressing the concerns of its current playerbase and substantial revisions made to the premium store.

I can only advise people to stay away from this game until serious changes have been made.",1676669287,1676669287,False,13,0,0.530335307121276855,0,True,False,True

I don't have this many hours for nothing, and I honestly don't have any significant complaints.  Its basically a relaxing life-sim game that I want to say is nearly a spiritual successor and/or Disney's version of Nintendo's Animal Crossing.  You don't really need to know much more.  The core differences are that this has a main story plus side stories for each character (you could argue Animal Crossing has a story, but I'd argue that its always been secondary at best to the gameplay wheras there's clear advancement here), you don't have to mindlessly hunt characters and the character limit is much higher.  Otherwise how you play the game is probably much like how you'd play Animal Crossing; decorating your land to make it appealing, coordinating outfits for your character, trying to minmax your production and profit or being a general psychopath with your own internal monologue.  

What few complaints I do have are very minor and in some cases just a matter of preference.  For instance, I feel like some of the characters that have been chosen to represent their respective movies/series are a bit questionable, such as Prince Eric who in my opinion's sole purpose of being in the game is for a plot point for Ariel and little more.  There are several other unrepresented franchises for whom that character slot could have gone, but for now I'll choose to trust in the devs choices.  For example, if they decide to add Alice in Wonderland I would much prefer they put in the work and make everything added for it both magical and faithful

I've had to revise this review because I did mention that the paid currency is of little to no consequence, but in the very next update they added a few things that are exclusive to paid currency.  This doesn't affect the gameplay but it is a bit concerning they are adding this type of content at this point.  For instance the Castle-style house is premium currency only and it is the only house cosmetic in the game aside from default.  This does make my review a bit less favorable but all and all I'd say the game is well worth the money regardless of whether or not its on sale.  I would however caution people to be aware that this type of change will eventually ramp up based on Gameloft's History; hopefully the items restricted will not become necessary items.  Like seriously I tried Asphalt 9 again after a few years and the amount of microtransactions makes it nearly unplayable.

A couple things I'd like to see in the future if possible:
-The ability to move herbs the same way as flowers (I would like to build an herb garden for Remy)
-Some level of teraforming so we can adjust rivers and lakes to suit our builds more (you could just block off this tool until you receive the tool upgrades you need to get rid of the darkness in each area)
-More decorations that compliment each other (there ara a lot of decorations but many of them are forced out of a design because they just don't match anything.  It would be nice to have more decor that tie together so this doesn't happen as much)
-Let us move and change our interior doors ffs the default off-mint green looks god awful and the default position of them is abhorrent.  I feel like theres no point to even work on my house until this is dealt with.",1675444232,1676668763,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For context, I am not a massive Disney fan. I've seen and enjoyed many of Disney's movies, but I am by no mean a die-hard fan.

Besides mentioning three of the very early game characters, this review is spoiler free in terms of story and character reveals.

Let's start with cons:
- The game gives you very little direction after the tutorial quests. Looking up guides are mandatory at the moment. I would like to learn that so-and-so gives me the shovel upgrade within the game somewhere and not have to look it up.

- The game-play, animations, and dialogue get somewhat repetitive at times.

- Being able to choose the area(mining, fishing, etc) in which each character specializes in is boring. Once you get all five(six?) skills to max level on a companion, using any other character just feels like you're missing out on extra resources you could've gotten from using your lvl 10 companion.

- There should be more options on what companions can specialize in. Cooking, removing dreamroot, and crafting all have the ability to be made into skills for companions to specialize in, but aren't. I can chock this up to the game not being finished, though.

- The ""Companions"" menu spoils all the Companions you don't have which is awful.

- Some characters just look bad. Characters with objects in their hands have said objects clipping through walls/rocks, and the player's running animation is choppy and ugly.

- There is a severe lack of outdoor decorations. 

Some of the above issues are most-likely due to the game being in early-access, so keep that in mind.

Here are some pros:
- Every character has their own unique dialogue, animations, quests, etc! That is extremely difficult to achieve with such a wide (and growing!) cast, and is appreciated.

- Making money is not easy, nor hard. Perfect amount of challenging

- The recipes are intuitive. Moana wants me to make a seafood salad? Easy- a seafood item and lettuce. Even things like fruitcake or apple pie are boiled down to 3-4 basic ingredients/catagories that are easy to figure out, even if you don't have the recipe.

- The seasonal pass pays for itself if you play enough. Perfect design, especially since this game isn't free.

- The fishing minigame is like the advanced version of the Animal Crossing fishing minigame. Just the right level of difficult for me, personally. The fish bubbles indicating the rarity of the fish so you can skip all the common fish once you're far enough is highly appreciated.

- The character customization is super fun!

This is not everything there is to be said about this game, and I'd give it some leeway as it is still in early access. It is extremely fun regardless of the cons, and I recommend it to anyone whos bored of all the cozy-sim games that have come out.

- Continued story with every major update
- Incredibly customisation. Everything from the layout of the valley, to the clothing you wear
- Tons to collect and discover 
- Characters act just how you'd expect them to based off their personalities in their respective shows/movies
- Pretty good graphics
- Music is sweet and fun, familiar Disney tunes you'd recognise play while travelling the valley
- Each area has it's own unique theme

Cons:
- You reach a point where story progression is locked behind a grind for starlight (in game currency given when completing objectives) or coins. This means you have to spend a lot of time mindlessly grinding in order to progress through the many content
- Lacks replay value
- Premium Shop prices are ridiculous (though this is a new feature and could be likely to change
- Once you complete the available quests and story, not much to do outside of decorate and farm coins for more decorative items. 
- Could benefit from minor quality of life changes or additions
- Doesn't really hold your hand. Which is good and bad.

This used to be a positive review but right now I can't recommend the game. It's a great game on the surface. It's whimsical, vibrant, and full of familiar faces. It's also extremely shallow, lacks any real end game content, and is now employing predatory monetisation tactics on a game primarily marketed towards children.

My first impressions of the game were great. I've clearly spent some time on it. It doesn't take long to complete all the quests for the various character, except the time gated stuff (lol), but the real draw for me was the decorating. I couldn't wait to decorate the island, something I've enjoyed in similar games like Animal Crossing. The decorating in this game IS fun, and there are a tonne of items to customise your island... but it's limited. The items really are just decorations. You can't swim in your pool or watch TV for example, but you can sit on benches... which is obviously super fun and engaging! Now on to the main issue. 

Imagine my surprise when after decorating 3 areas (there are 8 in total) I reached a limit of how many objects I could place. The limit is 600 unique items or 3000 items. It is pitifully low for a game where the ONLY activity after completing quests, is decorating. When I tried to find an answer on why this was so low, I was told ""because of switch limitations"". I'm not sure why it's so difficult to make it hardware specific, but it must be a low priority issue I guess. It's strange it's a low priority issue, since once again - it's the only thing to do after quests. There's no museum like in Animal Crossing, there's no mini games or anything. It's decorating. And it's shit. 

I kept hoping that it'd get better, or that they'd increase the cap. Surely they wouldn't ignore the one thing there is to do in the game, right? Well today they've introduced a new cash shop with decor items. It's not just your average cash shop either, it's on a rotation, so it's an extra shitty cash shop using FOMO tactics to get people to buy 3 pieces of furniture for the price of a regular DLC. I'm not exaggerating, the packets really are just 3 pieces of furniture, and some packets seems to have pieces that match others, which is enough strike against them, because you know exactly why they did that. The pricing is also ludicrous. I think it was around £50 to get everything in the shop (like 11 decor items). It's more expensive than Sims 4 pricing, so that's embarrassing. 

It's especially insulting, because even if I was an idiot that was going to throw MORE money at the game (I already paid for it once), I actually can't place those items in their store anywhere. My island is full, and yet most of the areas are barren. I want to make it clear, even if they increased the decor cap, the cash shop pricing, the rotation, the battle passes are all so egregious that it's hard to imagine this game getting any better. 

If you want games with a similar chill vibe that have upfront and fair pricing then I recommend Stardew or Spiritfarer. This is now a mobile game.",1662988761,1676602008,False,1,0,0.525000035762786865,0,True,False,True

1401590,132991061,76561198411137113,0,3,5277,0,4634,1694376229,"This game is peaceful and relaxing.  There's no violence or fighting.  At first, I thought it would be a bit more like Kingdom Hearts, with more exploration and battles.  But this game is meant to be more relaxing. 
There's a little bit of fishing, farming, crafting, cooking, foraging.  The mining and digging mechanics are a bit boring, they're so similar they almost could be combined into one.  Almost all the quests and tasks are very clearly laid out, literally step-by-step.  I say almost, because there were a handful of tasks that seemed to be missing a few directions, but I was able to figure it out.  Some  of the characters' storylines can be easily completed in one session, while others, like Mother Gothel require time to complete, (like waiting for a plant to grow).  Overall, I like the pacing of this game.    

I also like that the storylines and quests are loosely connected to each other.  You might have to help some characters before it unlocks other quests, but there's also so many characters to talk to , that you could have several quest lines running at the same time.  I sometimes wish the tasks were a little bit more difficult, or required more problem solving.  The Realms are a lot simpler than I thought.  They're just single ""rooms"" in which you have to complete a few tasks in order to invite the character to the village.  The main activity and quests for the game take place in the valley.

I like the companion mechanic, you can ask a character to hang out with you while doing tasks and your relationships with them will increase significantly, rather than just relying on gifts.  I make sure to always have a companion with me at all times and I rotate them out, depending on my tasks.  I wish Ariel was able to be a companion earlier in her storyline.  She stays in her mermaid form until the end of her quests, and then she's able to switch to her human form.  Only then can she be a companion, but by that time I really don't need her around anymore.  Unless there's some future updates that add more quests to the current characters.  

Once you've maxed out the relationship with a character, there isn't much else to do with them.  They end up just saying the same things over and over, I wish they had more variety in their scripts.

I found it quite easy to  amass large amounts of Dreamlight, just by paying attention to the dreamlight tasks.  There are daily tasks that reward you with dreamlight, but if you only focus on those, it won't be enough to unlock the biomes.  I found it helpful to double up on dreamlight tasks by also browsing the longterm dreamlight goals.  Oftentimes the dreamlight tasks will sync up with what you already need to do in one of the quests.

One of my favorite things to do in the game while I'm between quests is cooking.  It's fun to experiment and try mixing different ingredients together to find the right combination to make a specific recipe.  I almost have all of them figured out!  The only downside is you can only cook one dish at a time.  I wish I could cook multiples of the same dish at one time, as long as I have the proper amount of ingredients.  The crafting table lets you craft multiples, so why not the cooking recipes also?  I also wish there was another way to get milk, cheese, butter, eggs, peanuts and ice besides buying them from Remy's Pantry. ( with money you earn in game) 

The other thing I love to do is customize the village.  The game gives you absolute freedom to rearrange practically everything.  All the buildings and paths, trees, etc you can move around to your liking.  Things like landscaping, trees and rocks, you can have an endless supply.  But the lamposts, paths, etc.  ""manmade"" objects you have to craft yourself or purchase from Scrooge.

Everything you need to complete your quests are available in the game, you don't have to make in-game purchases (with real money) in order to progress.  The recent update added the ability to purchase additional furniture, clothing, and other customization for the game, by purchasing moonstones.  However, these are just extra options, purely cosmetic.  It's not necessary to enjoy or play the game, so I won't be purchasing any moonstones, especially since you can find moonstones in the game.

The entire game centers around memories, helping various villagers recall their memories, while also discovering more about your role in the story.  That's what the quests are all about.  Some of the quests require you to find someone's missing memory. There's probably a handful of quests where you have to find a memory for someone. There are lots of ""memories"" (glowing orbs) that pop up in the world every once in a while that you collect.  They seem to pop up at random and there are far more than required in the quests. 
 They are scenes from the various disney movies.  There are some memories that are pages from your ""journal"".  Some of them are broken into pieces and you have to find them all to complete the picture, but so far they haven't revealed any important information or clues or secrets.  They don't seem to have any deeper purpose, as far as I can tell.  They don't really seem to be integrated into the storyline, which seems like a missed opportunity.   I'm not sure if there's a point to them.  Maybe further down the road, with more updates?

So overall, the game is much simpler than I originally imagined, but yet still manages to keep things interesting and sucks you in!  I absolutely adore Wall-E and Stitch!  All the characters manage to keep their personalities and style from their individual movies, but still feel like they could all live together in the valley and their quests and tasks make sense for each character.  Also the soundtrack is great, I could listen all day.  You can hear various strains and melodies from the different movies but it's all combined into a new score.  Love it!

Returning to the point of the MTX shop, I kind of expected the prices to be ridiculous given the Devs are a mobile developer. Yet despite this, they somehow managed to blow my expectations out of the water. 9 furniture items and a house skin are the first set of items available. To buy all of these would require spending £49.50. And the shop renews in 5 days, when presumably you'd have to spend another £50 to get all the new content. At this rate you could be spending as much as £300 a MONTH on in-game furniture and getting less than a £20 expansion pack for The Sims 4.

Donald used to be my favourite until his constant tripping, the gardening in this game can be tedious just as much as Stardew Valley and some of the quests in this game are a bit quick but you'll feel overwhelmed with how many you can do.

So far I've only had 3 glitches in the game so for me I feel like it's been a lucky break. You'll feel annoyed but will quickly get over it because the game hooks you into feeling at ease. 

For what you get in the game already, it was def. worth my $25 because it certainly made me happy during the holidays. Of course this is only because I was actually expecting to not be happy but I'm glad I got the game. 

The chores in the game are tedious and can be repetitive, you know the gardening, the cooking, some house decorating, trying to gain money is like asking Scrooge Mcduck for a loan. Gathering materials like sticks and rocks can get very boring fast and you feel like going insane once you find out it needs to be done for a quest.

It was worth my $25 regardless of it becoming free to play or not, I went into the game expecting not to like it and somehow grew addicted to the simple things in this game. I am only 100 hours in this game and still have not finished the many quests that you get after unlocking some of the characters. 50% of the reason is due to the gathering of materials and the time it takes.

I rate this...8/10 on a personal scale. I enjoyed it because I like Disney movies and I love the idea of getting to interact with your favourite Disney characters. It has everything I was wanting to experience in a game like this since I can't visit Disney world so I'm happy with this.",1676532604,1676532604,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Basically this game is Disney's rival of Animal Crossing, without half the annoyances like breaking tools, with actual fan service and support. Yes there's still quite a few complaints I could make but for EA, what will be a free game when launches officially but even now the value in Moonstones (the cosmetics) is good and a fair balance so the Devs can afford to keep this game alive while mostly giving the players something worthwhile in return even if all cosmetic. You heard that right, there are microtransations however this is entirely cosmetic. I have an unhealthy amount of playtime (Across Steam, Switch and Xbox I have just shy of 1000hours) as find playing so relaxing and theraputic. 

I probably am not the best person to comment on balancing or the like as I have way more of everything than can possibly use so I'm not going to be a typical player in how review, however what I can say is if you are a Disney fan, love games like Animal Crossing but want devs that actually care about the game making and engage with passionate community, this is a must get. 

I do have issues with the game don't get me wrong, it's far from perfect even for Early Access however I absolutely recommend getting this game. It's one of my absolute favourites!",1676494051,1676497459,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

(noncombat) The characters can follow you around and you choose one thing each they can help with and they give you bonus items based on what you're gathering. The world is beautiful, I love the graphics. Everything is usually super smooth. 

I will say that since I have been playing, I have had this chronic bug where once in a blue moon, a character will lean down to pick up something and get stuck in the standing up animation and just rapidly go up and down. I've found I can stop it by putting myself in between them and the object. I've tried unpartnering them but they go right back to it lol. I also can't seem to pick my butter up from the table, I've tried for 3 days! That's just a minor annoyance, though, when I am decorating.

All in all, this is definitely worth it. I've had so much fun during this early access and have found so much stuff to keep me busy. It has a great amount of content, I felt overwhelmed at first with all the quests you unlock. They also have star paths which are like battle passes but you can earn everything for free if you have enough currency and then at the end, you usually gain enough to unlock the next star path.

The basic summary is that if you are a fan of Animal Crossing and/or Stardew Valley, you will enjoy this since it basically copying all the mechanics and features you liked and several you didn't like.  The game is still in Early Access and will be FTP later this year or next, and there are still some things being worked out by the devs.

For starters, it's a massive mess when it comes to collecting stuff and storing it.  There are 21 different crops you can plant, for example, and almost as many different kinds of crystals, gems, and other minerals, not to mention harvestable resources like various kinds of good, stones, dirt, etc.

That would be awesome if it wasn't such a pain storing it all.  The storage chest system is being overhauled in the Update 3 due next week on Feb. 16 (2023) and I hope they do a massive bit of fixing for it to make it easier and less irritating.

Once you have opened up the full map and unlocked access to all the crops and various things you can forage/mine, then the sky is the limit when it comes to what you can do with decorating and re-arranging your valley elements.  The story and friend missions are all simple fetch/craft/talk quests and there's a lot of them, with more getting added with each new character put into the game.

The controls are pretty easy to get used to, if you have played other games, but there is little in the way of documentation or telling you how to do stuff early on.  You have to either figure it out or go online and seek out communities of players.  For example, when you are trying to unlock Remy from Ratatouille, there is a task where you help him in his kitchen and he asks you to wash dishes.  The dishes are in a glittering bin on the floor so you can't miss them.  What it doesn't tell you is that there is no interaction prompt.  You walk up to them and have no idea what to do.  You can't pick them up and there is nothing which pops up.  It was on a whim that I pulled out my watering can and poured water on them and that did it.  For this reason, very young players or people who are not used to established game mechanics from other games might have some difficulty and frustration in trying to progress and learn.

Overall, the game is a success in my view and worth the price if you want something along the lines of games already mentioned.  The best thing, if the devs hold true, is that the game will be expanded continuously in the future, with a mix of free and paid DLC updates to add to the game and fix user issues or feature requests.",1676126434,1676126434,True,16,1,0.655729532241821289,0,True,False,True

It's basically a load of quests which need you to garden, mine, fish, dig and cook in order to complete them and level up yourself and your friendships with characters. My favourite part is designing the kingdom, though. You can move buildings, plants, benches and all the lil nick nacks and make it really cute and unique. I also love customising my character - you can design your own clothes, too, if you don't want the common clothes everybody can buy from the store (this is also where you can buy furniture for your home). I'm glad we are getting frequent updates with new characters and quests. I would still say this game could do with alot more to it - for example I'd love it to be multiplayer, or at least be able to visit others kingdoms and leave gifts etc. We definitely need more biomes. And some more skills to learn wouldn't hurt. I do really love the game, I just think that myself and others that have had the game since it came out are a little bored of the repetitiveness of it.

1. Auto sort for your bag/boxes. I hate disorganized boxes but when you have to click on an item one at a time to organize it yourself it gets annoying.
2. A ""Sell All"" button or the ability to click multiple stacks to sell instead of clicking each stack individually to sell.
3. Bigger boxes for storage, maybe make the current ones upgrade-able? That would be nice.
4. Sprint button! Gotta go fast......
5. The ability to layer clothes. I hate that I can't wear a dress and a coat at the same time. or you lose a necklace because you want to wear a turtle neck (like it isn't seen anymore even though you still have it on?)
6. More clothes for customization, unless this is already planned then please ignore.
7. The ability to pick single walls/sections of floors for decorating. Sometimes the ""cover all"" with a certain type of wallpaper or flooring is really overbearing/overwhelming
8. Ability to move the doors in the house! Having them directly centered really throws off the ""feng shui"" of the space sometimes.

Whilst this isn't your typical farming game like most that're out there, I still consider it to be a fairly decent farming game in this aspect. 
Each ingredient that has been planted, has their own specific times of how long they will be before they are ready,  and whilst you have to wait for it, you often time have to water it, depending on how long they will take to grow. 
I have mixed feelings about this, although I find it to be unique, I sometimes found myself needing the ingredient right then and there, making it difficult to progress further in the quest, so I mainly have to sit there and twiddle my thumbs while I wait. I often move onto another game because of this, or another quest in my log. 
However, the ingredients are need for either cooking, or quests. Cooking I found to be very fun and simple in this game, considering most farming games with cooking can be a tad complex. 
It's to the point, which I like. 

Quests, are.... somewhat decent. They're your typical quests in any game. What's nice about them, is sometimes you get stuff to upgrade your weapons, or it boosts your friendship with the characters. 

There is a weather and night time / day time cycle in this game. However, the night time / day time cycle is based upon real life time, so if it's dark where you live, it'll be dark in the game. I do like these kinds of details though, I always found them to be really neat. 

Shops and upgrades can be a bit of a task if you want to have everything in your stall unlocked, or everything in the shop unlocked, etc. 
I sometimes find myself spending the whole day just trying to get enough money to upgrade one stall. 
Although I don't mind the grind, it can be a bit overwhelming here, as there's just so much to upgrade at once, it's hard to want to go around and gather the money for it. 

For the areas... I don't really have a favorite, while I find them to be decent and pretty, they just aren't something I really care for all that much. I'm hopeful they'll eventually add more areas later, as it's pretty boring being tired to just a couple of areas, in which, I've unlocked within a week or so of pure grinding. 
What I really like about them, is that each area has their own companion, which you get to feed daily, and it'll eventually become your own pet! 
I just wish that it would tell you what those animals like to eat, as I found myself looking up every single one to see what eats what. How else are you supposed to know if you don't look it up??? 

As a disney game; 
I would highly recommend it if you a huge disney and farming addict like I am! It's truly worth it. 
I didn't know how they would combine disney and farming into one game, but they made it work, which is a refreshing surprise. 

The characters are really nice too, although I have my favorites, they easily can make the characters more tolerable in this game. 
As you hang out with the characters, they will occasionally level up, which means, if you level them up, you get rewards tied to this character that you choose to hang out with! 
I really liked this, as there's some really cool stuff that certain characters have. 

I'm truly looking forward to what this game has in store for the future, it'll be nice seeing it grow.~ 

Whether you want it for the disney aspect, or the farming, I'd highly recommend it for either way! It's well worth the game play for both!

It's not for kids as much as you'd think; there's a lot of reading (there isn't full voiceacting) and resource management and it doesn't hold your hand for every quest/solution. The writing is really genuine and decent for every character, there's a pretty compelling plot you're working on, everything is pretty tight and nice to look at, and the music is really good and not as derivative as you'd expect. It's fun to watch the Disney characters interact and see how their stories interplay.

It is very grindy, and Donald Duck literally does throw a fit every 30 seconds which is.... a choice. But if you like life sims/farming games this one is a solid entry. It's very similar to Animal Crossing except Tom Nook is Scrooge McDuck basically. I think I'm having a better time with this than I did AC too.

The game is very laid back and relaxing, there's no fighting enemies so no skills or reflexes are needed in that sense. Kind of reminds me of Farmville :D It's easy to come back to play whenever you feel like it, regardless if it's gonna be a short while or for hours. I also love that the devs keep coming up with new stuff along the way since it gives the player motivation to keep coming back time after time.

[u]Full Review[/u]

I was on the fence about getting this game due to Disney's recent downward spiral.  However, after looking into the content and gameplay I decided to give it a chance... and I'm glad I did!  I have a young daughter who loves various Disney characters, and this has been a great game to play with her.

The stories are surprisingly engaging, and I *love* that characters from different settings will interact throughout the stories.  For example, Ariel trades with WALL-E for ""human artifacts"", and Stitch thinks it's hilarious to prank Donald Duck.  I thought the characters would stick with others in their respective setting (that would have been the easy, lazy path for developers), but they don't and it really makes the game feel like one big community as you add more characters to the valley.  Kudos to the content team for putting the effort in and making the various quests ""make sense"" in the context of the gameworld and the characters involved!

The gameplay is very solid, too.  There are plenty of resources to gather, and they respawn fairly quickly if you're looking for something specific.  As you start unlocking more zones it greatly expands your options, and you can easily teleport around via the map (so no lengthy running back and forth).

There are a ton of furniture and clothing items to collect, and Scrooge's store has a 24-hour rotation with several options (especially once it's fully upgraded).

Gardening (farming) is a great way to earn coins to purchase the aforementioned items, as well as build houses for new characters as you get them unlocked.  Before harvesting, get a character with the Gardening skill to hang out with you and get a bunch of bonus plants!

My daughter enjoy meeting and interacting with the new characters, and we're really excited to see where the game goes in the future!

(Especially as real estate becomes more limited in the valley - I'm not sure where we're going to fit a house for everyone...)

If you're a fan of Disney classics and are looking for a laid-back game, I definitely recommend giving Dreamlight Valley a go.",1675318351,1675318351,True,1,0,0.47837415337562561,0,True,False,True

If you're an avid ACNH decorator and wanting to branch into Dreamlight, read this first. This may be long, just fair warning.

My overall opinion is that with fixes to certain issues, this game is great and absolutely worth money now. It will be especially worth it when it's free to play. I genuinely enjoy playing this game and find it soothing to play either with friends in voice chat or while listening to favorite shows. Because it's early access, I'm going to list cons first so you know what you're in for. Some of these will be bugs, and others will be opinions.

Cons:
- There is a decorating limit. Once you hit a certain amount of items (which appears to include every single rock, tree, fence, and bush), you are unable to put anymore items down in the valley. I am unsure of the current limit, because there is no obvious limit counter easy to see -- I actually hit the limit with only half the sunlit plateau, half of frosted heights, 1/4th of forest of valor, and the entire meadow decorated. That means I barely touched at all the plaza and the beach, and haven't done any decorating aside from remove trees in the glade of trust and the forgotten lands. I will admit that I prefer to line my paths with small rocks or bushes as I don't typically find the wavy edges of the pathing pleasing. If they make an update to significantly raise the limit or remove it, I'll update this review. This has actually made me debate not playing until it's raised or removed as I spent hours decorating the sections that I did. As of October 21st 2022, I'm at the limit. (EDIT Jan 28th '23: I found out a few weeks after this review that there is a mod for pc players that removes the decorating limit, which was only in place because it's a cross platform game and some consoles may not be able to keep like a pc could.)
- As expected with early access, a decent amount of quests are buggy. However, they are trying to work on those and when they can, they roll out updates fixing them for players. There are some quests you must be patient with that were designed to take more than a day, unfortunately one of them is severely buggy and hasn't been fixed. (It took me roughly 3 days, and my boyfriend has been on it roughly 3 weeks -- he is essentially softlocked on it as there is no abandon or restart quest option as of October 21st 2022. His only option is to wait for a fix or restart his entire save. The devs are aware of it and working on a solution to my knowledge.) (EDIT Jan 28th '23: They fixed the quest that he was stuck not long after I posted this review, I've just been busy since and forgot to update. My bad!)
- The weird animations of some decorations. The Up themed hot air balloon, for example, appears to only have individual balloons moving when near it. Mine is on dazzle beach because I don't know where I want to use it. Standing on the beach, I see the individual balloons move. Standing in the meadow and looking at the balloons....the entire collection of balloons move in the wind as one and quite wildly. They went almost totally horizontal.
- Some of the voice lines are....questionable. Elsa, specifically. She doesn't always sound PG-13 when she's reading letters from Anna. It's kinda funny.
- We got Ariel legs. Ariel walks around. Ariel refuses to hang out. Rude.
- Why do we have Kristoff, Anna, and Elsa but no Sven or Olaf? Why is Eric so fine being here without Max (his sheepdog from the movie)? Why is Mickey so fine without Pluto? Does Ariel not miss Flounder and Sebastian?
- Sometimes the ""furniture mode"" (decorating mode) camera is a little wonky, which gets annoying pretty fast if you have a lot of trees.
- Also, sometimes when you leave furniture mode, it doesn't save the latest thing you've done and you have to go back and redo it -- or, even more bizarre, it saves half of the latest thing you did and not the other half so you get a weird merger of decorating you have to fix.
- In addition to furniture mode issues, harvestables can still randomly spawn while in furniture mode and often in the way of what you're doing. You can't move them like you can flowers or sticks, you have to exit the mode and go harvest them.
- There's a Minnie quest that requires a lot of clay (and iron - but that's not the point of this). The easiest way to do it was to trap your digging buddy in a fenced in area, dig up half or all of a biome, release the buddy to collect their extras for you, and then use furniture to force the despawn of the holes.....apparently, this has been patched out. Digging is now a little more annoying.
- The paths don't meet up. What I mean is that if you're using brick path in one area to be a main road and then want a dirt path to be a less used road, you will have a 1 path tile gap between them exposing the default biome ground. They will not connect, you will have a gap exposing the ground beneath.

Pros:
- THE ATLANTIAN STUFF MAKING A COMEBACK. My favorite disney movies were Atlantis the Lost Empire and Treasure Planet, so seeing all the Atlantian things has me extremely excited. Literally gasped and shrieked when I first saw a note with the language, and again every time I saw a pillar or decoration with Atlantian items.
- It's pretty!
- I like the instrumental background music of all the disney songs. (Also, if you have a radio playing somewhere in the valley, you can hear a minion talking as though he were a radio announcer between songs.)
- You get to befriend and force disney characters to hang out with you. (Minus the water folk.)
- The decorating (despite the major drawback) is fun! I enjoy it a little too much, as you may have guessed by me already hitting the limit. I have a tendency to start decorating and then realize it's been three hours.
- The crafting is fun! And I appreciate them updating with some Autumnal decorating items, as I had really wanted to make my forest fall themed. (rip that dream though as I did hit the decorating limit)
- The Star Paths (basically their version of a season pass) are pretty cool so far. I am thriving with the Villainous star path.
- It just has good vibes tbh
- Scar is sassy, Merlin is hilarious, and Donald's tantrums make me laugh every time.
- They are planning to update it consistently with new content. (We already got Scar, and we know that at the very least they're also releasing Toy Story characters/realm this year.)
- The devs appear to have active staff in the official dreamlight valley discord, which is always refreshing especially with an early access game. If you get dreamlight, I highly suggest joining the server. It will help inspire you and help with figuring out bug issues.
- On the star path, if you would rather spend the paid for currency to buy star path tokens and advance quicker, you can! I wouldn't do it now as I'm not totally sure how you get more of it (you get some to start with by buying the deluxe or ultimate), but it's nice to know that if there's something you really want, you can get there with a faster option.",1666386281,1674938822,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I find myself playing it every day, even if its just for an hour, half an hour, or just to check up on things, it doesn't matter because there is always something to do.
The characters are cute and quirky, and it is so funny to see them have a random conversation sometimes. 
Coming from Animal Crossing, i really like games where I can build and design my own little space and that's an aspect i appreciate in this game as well. I can design to my hearts content, and make it unique. 
At this moment it feels like the possibilities are endless (only played 45 hours so far so i am not sure yet), and seeing that there are people who spend more than 500 hours makes me confident I don't have to feel bored anytime soon :)
There are SO many Disney Characters, and I truly hope the creators of this game take advantage of that. 
Wouldn't it be amazing to have a bunch of Dalmatian puppy's running around in your town? 
Visiting Belle's huge castle, or having fun with Aladdin, Genie, and Jasmin in their Arabian desert town?

Even if you're not completing quests it's very easy to farm, mine, gather and fish for hours on end. I absolutely love the customization and freedom to make your village look exactly how you want it too. Even though the game is in early access I'm pleasantly surprised with how much content is practically fully fleshed out, there are 60ish hours worth of quests and infinite hours of farming, mining, gathering and fishing. There aren't that many bugs and glitches either which is what I was most worried about, after nearly 85 hours I have only run into 2 major bugs and a small glitch.

From the 2 major bugs the first appears when characters are leveling up to level 2 during dialogue (e.g. quest dialogue or daily discussion), this would glitch out the game and make it so that nothing can be pressed. The only solution I found was shutting down the game from steam then starting it back up again. To avoid this from happening I gift or cook for new characters until they reach level 2 as soon as I can.
The second is that the sunlit plateau sunstone fragment from Mother Gothel's quest doesn't show up haulting any progress. From what I've seen online this is a common issue and the fragment will randomly appear, for me it only appeared 4 days later.
The minor glitch is just the mining helper character's glitching/clipping onto nothing when getting the bonus ores/gems. To fix this you just need to nudge them a bit to reset the walking animation or go into furniture mode and remove any bushes or rocks that are near them that could be getting in their way.

Between the packs there isn't really much true value difference besides the moonstones, everything else is cosmetic. The only difference between the [i]standard[/i] companions and the [i]deluxe/ultimate[/i] ones is purely cosmetic and you'll be able to tame the same type in the [i]standard[/i] version. I bought the [i]deluxe[/i] pack because I genuinely loved the cosmetic items and companion and it gave a good amount of moonstones + holiday sales, so I was willing to shell out more but objectively there isn't much difference from the standard version.

Overall it's a really fun game to unwind to and doesn't have many glaring issues even though it is in early access. If you're planning to buy it in early access shell out for the [i]deluxe[/i] or [i]ultimate[/i] version only if you genuinely love the cosmetic items, otherwise [i]standard[/i] already has everything you need. If you're not in a rush, waiting for the game to be fully released in it's [i]free to play[/i] state might be best.",1674609037,1674609037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you are a fan of Animal Crossing (New Horizons), many aspects of game play will be a refreshing change (crop/foraging spawn timers, npc quests, cooking - just to name a few.)
Purchased the Ultimate edition on Switch, but used to cloud save to access the game on Steam, since the Switch version was very frustrating and difficult to control (camera angles, moving furniture. menus are all vastly improved on the PC version)

Edit:  After playing for several weeks, I can no longer recommend this game - unless you enjoy MASSIVE amounts of RNG.  Clothing, furniture and items to decorate your valley and home are obtained via Scrooge's shop and supposedly chests.  EVERY day there are repeat furniture items in the shop - things that I literally purchased two days before.  Some days, spaces in the shop are just empty.  From what I understand, there are ""chest exclusive"" furniture items - but I cannot attest to that personally, since the only item I've ever received from a chest was a boarded up window that comes with your house at the start of the game. 
After countless hours I have finally reached 300/1200 possible items - but over 150 of those are things I've crafted - which requires countless hours of farming iron and other materials.

Three is also a unrealistic limit to the number of placed items in your valley.  If you have terrible luck with RNG you may think decorating with trees is is answer to fill all the empty space where furniture and items should be - nope, each tree counts as an item and trees drop wood constantly - with each stack of wood counting against your item limit (as do herbs that spawn, mushrooms and sea shells).  Some of these things may change when the game releases as free to play - but for now what ever algorithm is used for the shop and chests are just simply BROKEN.  My fear is the shop is working as interned, and once the game goes free to pay the RNG won't be as bad if you want to pay some cash.",1672538135,1674402593,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Highly addictive, even considering all the bugs that hold the game back.
Free with game pass so maybe try it there before committing to purchasing one of the bundles, not many people like the idea of buying an early access game and with good reason.

Constant patches and updates are a blessing with a team behind the game that pays attention down to the little details, recently removing the low energy screen animation because many people disliked it.

Really nice community to top it off, all around goodness to relax with after a stressful day.
Highly recommend playing, even for a little while.

I was actually looking for a family member who I thought might like it, so I read through the comments. I noticed a lot of adult men who could not stop raving about the game. I figured if even guys love this game then it's gotta be good, right? It seemed like most everyone loved the game. 

Well, it turned out my instincts were right! I absolutely LOVE this game now too! And I've played my fair share of survival games where you have to craft things and farm for materials or resources, but this game takes out A LOT of the tediousness from farming and crafting. You farm and craft faster and it's made easier. You even find yourself enjoying the farming and crafting and doing all the tasks that are generally incredibly tedious in other survival games. 

What's most rewarding about this game are the quests and the characters. Its main story is pretty brilliant in my opinion and how it's interwoven. It's really rewarding clearing areas of the night thorns, while getting to save and interact with Disney characters we all know and love. 

It's also genius making this survival game with its characters and quests as the most REWARDING part of the game! I enjoy unlocking new areas. Once you get a lot of star coins, you'll be waiting for Scrooge McDuck's store to drop its new clothing line or furniture sets! 

I honestly wanted a game that I could relax to that's single player. There's so much negativity and toxicity online that you run into. There's many things going on in the world right now that people can feel down about. This game definitely lifts one's spirits! It's a great game to relax to as you create your own world surrounded by familiar Disney characters. There's a pleasantness about the world and the art designs that's comforting. All I can say is that once you start playing, you'll be hooked! 

I played early access, so of course there's still bugs that need to be fixed. Here's a few bugs I noticed: 

-Disney characters who mined with me were getting stuck during the mining. 
-Some areas had a hard time re-spawning their flowers back like in the Sunlit Plateau, until I unlocked the entire area. 
-When the Disney characters leveled, sometimes the game would freeze and I'd have to restart the game.
-Some of the furniture I bought didn't show up when I tried to place it in my house like Stitch's TV. It was invisible!
-Pua the pig didn't show up when I was rescuing him, so there should be an animation for that. I had no clue that I had earned him as a companion pet either.  

The bugs are not that big of a deal, because you can easily work around them. I know it was a little frustrating to wait for a flower to repopulate but once I unlocked the rest of the area the spawn rate increased. 

One issue I had with the game was some of the areas like Forest of Valor and the Forgotten Land, those places were hard to walk around due to the fact that the trees make it REALLY hard to see sometimes. I hope that when they add new areas that they start making the trees taller or higher up or something. It makes it difficult to forage. And some of the quests could be more interesting. If it weren't for the quests and the characters, the game would be stagnant. I was concerned that the game might end up like the Sims, which I get easily bored with. The characters and quests make it a thousand times more rewarding. Plus, you have cosmetic items to look forward to. I didn't find the potions for mining very helpful as they don't last as long as the ones for fishing. 

What are some helpful tips for new players?

-Keep your iron ore, rocks, and coal ore. Coal ore you need for everything, including cooking. Iron ore you need continually, you'll run out of it the fastest. Rocks can also be a difficult material to come by when you need it, so don't sell it. 
-Always have a Disney character with you whenever you're farming resources. For example, if you're trying to mine iron ore... ALWAYS have a Disney character with you who has mining. You'll get extra resources from them if you have them along.
-Iron ore is NOT in every area. The only places you can find iron ore is in Forest of Valor, Glade of Trust, Frosted Heights, Sunlit Plateau, and the Forgotten Lands. You'll need to unlock one of these areas in order to mine for iron ore. Do not waste your dreamlight, until you've unlocked an area with iron ore. 
-Every time you level up Disney characters, it will unlock quests. Be careful not to level up several characters at the same time or you'll get overwhelmed by all the quests. Try to focus on leveling one or two Disney characters at a time. 
-The quickest way to get rich is to sell off your gems, until you unlock the Forgotten Lands and can become a millionaire by selling off pumpkins. Try to sell between 300-600 pumpkins a day when you can afford it! 
-If you're having a hard time fishing a specific catch, you can make a potion as a miracle fishing bait. Use it on the white circle fishing spots to turn them into yellow circle fishing spots. 
-The foods I prefer are Arendellian Pickled Herring, Potato Leek Soup, Ratatouille, and Fruit Cake for energy. 
-You can get pet companions by feeding animals in the area their favorite foods. Feed all the animals once a day in each area. Companions can be summoned by going to your wardrobe and going into the companions option. 
-The time of day in game is based on your own time zone. 

Things I'd like to see more of... more Disney dress options to buy at the store. I did like that for some of the rewards that dresses were a reward. I'd like to see a lot more content released like maybe a big expansion with more characters and quests. 

There's something very calming and relaxing about the game that makes you feel good. It's a very positive and pleasant experience. Maybe something to do with the familiarity of the characters by getting to help out characters you recognize from your childhood is pretty damn amazing! 

I could not recommend this game enough. If you want a feel good game, it doesn't get any better than this! Plus, Ursula gets to be your neighbor. Just what you always wanted, right?",1674209927,1674268514,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I did not originally think that this would be a game for me, but I started playing this at a friend's house on their switch as I had with Animal Crossing.  Then, I started to like it and saw that it was available on steam and without hesitation, bought it during the Christmas Steam sale.

This game is very much like playing Animal Crossing.  A few differences, but smooth and relaxing for those not wishing to stress out with video games.

The questing has some great quests and some well designed ones.  A lot of them use items that you can just grab as you are going on about your business.  Some fetch quests, some crafting quests, and some go and to to so and so quests.  As some reviewers have stated, the quests do seem to get a little more grindy as you get to higher levels with some of the later game characters.  It isn't one of those games that are so grindy that it takes you days to find everything, but it may take a few hours of mining or grabbing a bunch of flowers and waiting for them to respawn type of thing.  Some quests do make you wait days before you can finish them, so just more annoying than anything.

This is different than animal crossing in that you can power level characters all the way up in a matter of 30 minutes.  Where as animal crossing only lets you interact once per day.  I'm sure that there is a happy medium here where they can add some time to the game but not make it too much of a wait by limiting how much you can level or interact with characters per day.

Overall, I'd say this game is awesome especially for being an early access game.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and was worth every penny!  A few bugs and issues still crop up like getting stuck in the doorway or when you give a character quest items and the give menu doesn't go away and you have to close the game and get back in.  But, the game always seems to work fine upon restart.  Great game!  Enjoy this great experience!",1674256271,1674256271,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

GRIND - Yeeeeah its grindy, not gonna lie, but it's fun once you start getting the hang of things

Personally I've never been the type to play very active games such as shooters or online matches, and have always been one to play games like Disney dreamlight valley which the games would be Minecraft and animal crossing: so if you're looking for games with hard challenges or slow paced games this isn't the game for you.

[h1] How the game starts [/h1]
From the moment the game starts you'll be introduced to the Dreamlight valley: which has now been taken over by a evil mystical force and YOU has the new ruler of the valley has to try to help the village go back to the way it was.

Which the characters such as Merlin, Mickey and Goofy ( and others ) have lost their memories, so then you'll throughout the game collect diary entries and find photo memories to slowly build up the memories ( sorry if this doesn't make sense aha ).

And with each character there will be a friendship challenge which will help you gain Dreamlight shards ( or whatever you call them ) so open new sections and realms along with level yourself up and other characters.

[h1] My all together view [/h1]
I would give this game a 8/10 ☆ rating; the reason I give this a 8 is simple, Yes it's currently an early access game so when you unlock all the characters there's not many realm challenges ( if there is I haven't gotten to them yet which I apologise for ), along with personally I wish there were more voice lines! yes there could be a possibility of more to come but for characters like Merlin, I would like to hear him talk more along with hear characters like Elsa sing ( maybe? I personally would like to hear it as that's what she's literally known for! ).

There's also currently a few faults with the game such as it could just be for me but the game will freeze up multiple times until I will have to shut the game down to restart, also with the characters themselves- they will constantly walk into each other and glitch out!

A few glitches appear here and there, but not enough to destroy my gaming experience.

I enjoy the story and all the options you can do in said game. The fact that more characters will be added over time and possibly more areas is very exciting. There are minor problems here and there but nothing very extreme.

Disney Characters
Building, Crafting, cooking, etc
Designing your home, your land, your outfits, etc
A storyline that fits well with the universe

Cons: 
Not many clothing options for men
The build limit, really holds you off on your creativity
The high material you need to craft things (crafting pathings is super challenging sometimes)

I finally did, and I like it 100x better than the other two games. My favorite part about Dreamlight that is so different is that there are constantly new quests for you to do, and you can pick and choose which ones you want to currently work on, or grind a little at a few at one time. Another pro vs ACNH is your tools don't break, and vs Stardew, your crops grow within the same day. They all have different times of production, but you can go fishing or something while you are waiting for your crops. Also it is a perk to be a Disney lover because it really makes you want to unlock as much as possible. I like gaining Dreamlight for so many things, sort of like ACNH with Nook Miles. However, it is more rewarding and easier I feel to collect dreamlight than it is for Nook Miles and the nook miles are limited on what you can spend it on. Dreamlight is what gives you the power to unlock new realms and characters. I will say, sometimes the glitches are annoying... but overall a stellar game. I also like the Cloud Save feature, as I also purchased this for Switch.

For Disney Dreamlight, I'm somewhere in the middle, but leaning more towards no, having played 10 hours so far. I wanted to refund somewhere around 3 hours but that was past Steam's time allowance for refunds - so I hunkered down and decided to milk this game for all it's got. After posting this review, I'll sink more time in to complete all the available early access content, but somewhat begrudgingly -- just to get my money's worth out of the ~$25 I shelled out for it. 

This game is going to be completely Free-to-Play some time in 2023 and I would recommend if you're on the fence, to just wait until it's F2P. As it is now, you'd just be paying $30 for essentially a grindy F2P mobile game.

[h1]Pros[/h1]

To Disney's credit, this game is a solid attempt at a life sim. There's definitely [i]something[/i] here. 

[list]
[*]Fun to play in chunks of 1-2 hours at a time
[*]Graphics are really nice. All the characters, items and worlds are well-modeled and animated.
[*]Robust character creation options, outfits and accessories allow for a high degree of customization mostly unseen in this genre of games
[*]The limited voice acting - mostly short one-liners when you start talking to characters - is really well done. I do wish they'd done full VA, at least for cut scenes
[/list]
 
I might be showing my age here, but DDV feels like Disney's Virtual Magic Kingdom attempt at an MMO back in the 2000s -- but rendered in a way worthy of 2023. I could see 10-year-old me really, [b]really[/b] enjoying DDV. But it's just not quite scratching the right itch for now-almost-30 me. 

[h1]Cons[/h1]

Some people might think it's unfair to compare DDV to Animal Crossing - a game franchise that's had 20 years to perfect its craft. Unfortunately, it's a bit impossible [b]not[/b] to compare to ACNH or Stardew Valley, two similarly ""cozy"" games that involve comparable mechanics: mining, farming, cooking, friendships, fetch quests, etc. I would argue that DDV is inferior to both of these games, at least in its current state. 

There's no combat in DDV to make it a child-friendly, rated E for Everyone game in line with the Disney brand. This turns the main game plot into a [b]glorified series of fetch quests,[/b] getting increasingly harder to fulfill as each quest asks for more and more resources, some of which are rarer and harder to get. (I'm looking at you, Iron Ore.) 

Let me quickly break down the three main forms of ""currency"":
[olist]
[*]Dreamlight - Earned by completing quests, doing common actions like fishing, talking to villagers, selling items, mining, etc. Used for unlocking new Realms (where you go to complete quests to bring Disney characters like Moana or Anna and Elsa back to your town), or new areas of the Valley. Certain resources are ONLY attainable in these unlockable areas of the Valley. Equivalent to ACNH Nook Miles
[*]Star Coins - Earned by selling foraging items, crops, etc. to Goofy's stall, completing quests, or leveling your friendships with Disney characters. Used for buying seeds, crops, upgrading Goofy's stall to offer more items, unlocking the fast-travel points, buying homes for Disney characters, upgrading your house/storage/inventory space, and cosmetic items like furniture and clothing from Scrooge's shop. Equivalent to ACNH Bells
[*]Moonstones - Premium currency. The early access Founder's Pack comes with 8000, but there are in-game ""battle pass"" quests to grant additional moonstone. Used to unlock exclusive, premium cosmetics.
[/olist]

In order to progress the game, you need to grind enough Dreamlight and Coins to unlock areas and characters. Lots of farming and fishing, which anyone who's played a life sim is understandably down to do. But even after shelling out thousands of coins for new areas of the map, certain sections are still inaccessible until you upgrade your tools - a quest line that requires a high friendship level with specific characters (some of which you need to bring to the Valley still) and even more grinding for resources. 

Your storage is super limited, with the first few upgrades being pretty reasonably priced, but jumping from like 2k to 10k Coins out of nowhere. Until then, the only recourse you have is to craft Chests to store the million and a half different resources you need to hold onto just in case some random quest later on needs like 20 of it. Chests are 25 softwood each. The point is, this game is an [b]endless grind cycle[/b] where you're always grinding for dozens of resources at once.

The [b]real-time sync[/b] reminds me of Animal Crossing, but without the freedom to time travel through days and seasons. If you try to time travel, I've heard there's a high risk you'll brick your Dreamlight save completely. So you're stuck playing at a [b]snail's pace,[/b] grinding and waiting for resources to respawn, or crops to grow, or certain characters to wake up. 

For me, I only have time in my schedule to play games at night, which means certain parts of the game just aren't available to me. At least with ACNH, I can change my console date/time to catch up on daytime activities - and with SV, there are no such time constraints.

Here's the thing: It's not really the grind that's the problem. I'm used to grinding a bit when playing life sims. It's that the grind is clearly to get you to sink more time into the game artificially, with a model that's very obviously going to be F2P. This is a game that's [b]supposed[/b] to get you to grind to a certain limit each day, and log out, then log back in tomorrow. It's a game designed for Disney lovers, capitalizing on their love for Disney's animated properties. 

For some people, that's enough, but for me, [b]DDV feels empty.[/b]

Not to mention that every single time I've loaded this game, I've run into a game-breaking bug. Also, when I first started playing this game I got incredibly motion sick within 30 minutes. Had to turn down the graphics (which do look very nice tbh) and uncheck the flashes/screen shaking settings - and take some nausea meds. 

Also, cooking in this game is so painful for [i]whyyyy.[/i] You have to drag [i]each ingredient[/i] to the pot manually for each recipe, and you can't cook in bulk. Plus, recipes sometimes stack and sometimes don't in your already limited inventory space - total PITA.

[h1]QOL updates that I'd like to see implemented[/h1]
[list]
[*]Storage and Inventory Management: a sort button for your inventory and storage, an auto deposit-all button like SV has for transferring items from inventory to storage, making the house upgrades/storage upgrades cheaper. 
[*]Quests: a way to track multiple quests at once and to track the cost of certain upgrades like unlocking a new area or building a house for a new character. 
[*]Let us teleport from inside buildings please! And add a fast-travel point for the castle? 
[*]Pls all the game-crashing bugs especially when entering/exiting houses or trying to bypass whoever you're hanging out with at the time
[*]A way to skip through the dialogue bubbles when characters talk to each other. Why do they talk so SLOW? I spent the entirety of the Moana/Maui ""apology"" conversation mining and fishing nearby while I waited for them to finish. Geez. 
[*]Faster/more visible respawn timers on resources and crops. I spent like 30 min waiting for Pink Hydrangeas to respawn for a Moana quest. And I ran around for an hour between all the available mining veins to try to gather Iron Ore, or checking on the Tomato plant growing in the cave before I finally gave up. If we knew how long it would take for these spots to respawn or finish growing, I could just log out for a bit and come back?? But things seem to take anywhere from a few minutes to hours :'D

I bounce back and forward using the cloud save between PC and Nintendo Switch. I personally have not had any cloud sync issues in the 100 hours combined total, it has loaded flawlessly every time I switch devices, without fail.
The only performance issue I have is with the map screen. Occasionally when I tab across to the map, or select a character to follow the way to where they are located, the map will either freeze or simply show a blank purple area, and requires me to force quit the game. This happens on both Nintendo Switch and my PC running an i7-12700KF with a 3080 GPU, so it's clearly not a hardware issue as both devices are worlds apart in performance capabilities.
The auto saves are at decent intervals (I think 5-mins) so it's not too much of a problem when this freeze occurs.

Even the puzzles devolve into needing to go fetch something to complete them. That in itself isn't the worst aspect of it. I know it's early access but respectfully based on what we have we will not be getting much more than this.  

The Graphics are not impressive or magical but it looks good enough.
The animations are well done for the most part aside from your character. Looks like you are breaking your back when you run.
The music is good and is what you would expect.
The sound effects are good.
The voice acting or mostly the lack of it, while sounds good most of it is short 1 liners that have no context to what you have to read. There is zero reason this shouldn't be fully voiced at this price point.
When something happens that should be cool and magical it goes to a black screen when it changes instead of showing it happening(looking at you giant that looks like 3 rocks).
Storage is extremely lacking. all my inventory is maxed out but i dont have enough room for half of what the game needs me to constantly have on hand for the fetch quests forcing me to discard or sell things I will need later.
Housing is VERY disappointing. I have a big 4 room house with 2 floors but can only interact with 1 room at a time and have to go through portal doors to go to a different room or floor. Again at this price point it should be set up more like the sims. 
The map is ok for what it is. It does bother me that the castle is a seperate place and you cant teleport while you are in it or any other building/world. 

The game has it's charming points and is enjoyable to an extent but for the most part it is uninspired and robotic. I personally think it should cost half of what it does now for what we are getting. Maybe they will do more with it but in my experience since ""early access"" became a thing I have learned that what we have access to rarely changes much if at all.  Maybe I want to much but at the perspective cost of this game since it will have a cash shop in it I can not see it being much more then a magical cash grab.",1673721238,1673721238,False,6,0,0.506043910980224609,0,True,False,True

Let me hurry and get some stuff done before he finds me."" But after awhile when I was getting ready to finish up and sign out, I noticed I didn't see Mickey at all!! I was legit concerned. I was about to have a heart attack because I thought, ""does he not exist anymore??"" I ran to his house, busted down that door, and there he was just dancing around his kitchen. In that moment, Mickey became my BFF. I will protect him forever. 

I was worried I would find this game to be too boring but I absolutely love it! When I unlocked my first realm and met Moana and heard ""How Far I'll go,"" I belted out the lyrics so loudly despite it being instrumental music. It is a jam!

THIS IS THE ELDER SCROLLS OF FARMING LIFE SIMS. THEY KILLED MINNIE MOUSE IN THE STORY LOL
RIP RUSSI TAYLOR I MISS YOU :sob:

+ Unlike My Sims, you get control of pretty much the ENTIRE MAP'S DESIGN!
+ No rush to do any content in any order, I've personally ignored the main quest a lot haha
+ Rewards your dedication and time with currencies and levels that allow your character to do MORE!
+ Stamina system is negligible when ur house insta-fills it and food is everywhere; Gets you wondering why stamina was implemented in the first place.
+ Easy to obtain teleport spots
+ Even side-quests have the chance of giving permanent upgrades

~ Encourages real life breaks with timed respawns of items and limited quests per day, but not so much so that you'll run out of at least *one* task to do.
~ Debating whether I like the companion system. Setting them as something for life and then having to swap teammates everytime you wanna do something is annoying, but the rewards are great. Some seem clearly unbalanced though, like digging right now seems to be a waste of a companion skill. They also sometimes get lost, despite still gaining friendship points. It also only caps at level 10?
 ~ Fast travel!
 ~ Devs focus on big content updates instead of small patch fixes
 ~ Devs focus on content updates instead removing bugs and annoyances in the game, not my preference
 ~ This game truly in the end is just a bunch of cute grindy little tasks c:

- ONLY TWO KEYBOARD LAYOUTS LOL (can't customize individual keys)
- Gardening with companions is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877394747]painful in a way you can only experience[/url]
- Windows 11 User: Crashes a LOT. Can see why it saves so often lol.
- Your character gets stuck on a lot of really small objects ;c Why the fat shame?
dis game is better than aminal crossing and reminds me of My Sims
 - Continuing on that, your companion can bodyblock you from moving; If you're in a building, you cannot teleport out. 
 - Too many items with little to no real differences other than colour. Inventory fillers.
 - Can't try clothes or items before you buy in stores ;c 
 - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877394063]Ceiling does not match floor and cannot be changed uhh[/url]
- The battlepass system requires you to be caught up in the story line to complete 100%

Bugs still around after content patch one:
 - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877395397]Scrooge's building hides treasures[/url]
 - Many spots where money gets stuck. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877395819]This has been here since week one and thought it would be fixed today.[/url]
 - Why does everything somehow lead to Merlin I swear to heck
 - The more I play, the more it lags. 50+ hour world I'm playing on and load times suck.
 - The game is primarily tedious tasks to unlock new dialogue or areas.
 - Does not seem to be a way to get old Star Path items yet.",1664492868,1673587298,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True
1401590,125838635,76561198034520303,0,19,9976,0,7,1705507699,"OK, my ""not recommended"" is 100% due to the roll-out of the ""free"" avatar builder. In a nutshell, as a fun activity with my toddler we built her an avatar which she fell in love with, so we went ahead and purchased the game so she could play with her avatar but for numerous and complicated reasons, she couldn't actually play with her avatar that she loved, and that avatar was apparently thrown away like yesterday's jam. If you have ever had to deal with an emotionally heartbroken disappointed toddler, you understand why the ""not recommended"". 

The rest of the game is 50-50 ""meh"", could go either way. Of course Production value is great, in terms of appearance and ""voice acting"" (they got a lot original voice actors"" and the ones they didnt get are hard to notice; however the ""script"" is little more than grunts and exclamations (""huh?"") so there's not much there. Number 1 biggest problem is the ridiculous grind. You need Stone, (soft) Wood, and iron for everything worth building, and the grind is ridiculously (needlessly and purposefully) slow. Using Wood as an example - you need 25 wood (and other resources) to build a storage chest. You need MANY storage chests as they are small and you need a lot of storage. So, you need a LOT of wood, which you can only pick up in a limited section of the map, and one-at-a-time. You eventually unlock the ability to turn stumps into wood, and collect a lot of wood quickly that way, but the stumps don't respawn (everything else in the game does) so obviously this is an area where they purposefully made it needlessly slow/difficult. Later, you unlock a stall (Store) that sells wood, but you can only buy 10 at a time (it's the only store that has limited quantity, all other stores have immediate infinite supply) so again, obviously (and for no good reason) the game creators very specifically do not want you to get wood quickly. There used to be a bug/exploit that allowed you to buy chests, but that was removed from the game. So, many example that the creators do not want you to quickly increase your Wood and/or storage ability, with no good reason why - since you clearly need a LOT of storage. Iron is another ridiculously slow grind. There are only about 10 or so rock formations you can break to get iron and each rock formation yields about 1 (2 if lucky) iron clumps. You need 5 iron clumps to make 1 ingot, and most missions require 10 ingots. So, you can do that math, but needless to say, you're going to be breaking the same ~10 rock formations hundreds of times, to the point where you will get bored, say ""this is not fun"" and lose interest. Remember, this game is brought to you by the same people who think you want to spend your family vacation standing in a 4-hour line in 100+ degree weather arguing with other strangers about who is/not jumping the line. 

Second biggest problem is farming, specifically farming mechanics. While you are farming, there are 3 ""bonus"" situations you can get into. Long story short - your companion (or random forest creatures) will destroy your bonus situation on a regular basis. For example, your ""bonus"" involves you harvesting as many of the resource as you can within 4 seconds, but triggering the bonus also results in your companion ""leveling up"" and playing a 5-second animation for them leveling up... so you miss your entire bonus because your companion leveled up. Other companion/creature animations involve them moving to EXACTLY the point where you are standing, and your available actions turn into petting the creature or talking to your companion. So, instead of harvesting your bonus crops during your 4-second window, you now are petting random creatures or talking to your companion. Look up videos from other reviewers and watch them lock their companions in fences to avoid them interrupting the ""bonus harvest"". Its funny and sad at the same time. 

Third problem is companions in general. There are places where your companions will trap you and break your game. Companions will block the exit to your house, they will trap you in the kitchen in Chez Remy, and they will trap you in the narrow mine shafts in Sunlit Plateau. In most situations and locations, you can push your companion out of the way, but not all companions in all places. Obviously this is more of a bug that may get fixed as time goes on. Staying on the topic of broken companions - a companion provides you with a ""perk"" that increases your resource collection (for example, increasing a specific resource x2), but as mentioned, the grind is so long, and the bonus is so high that you never want to bother collecting a resource if your companion is not bonus-ing that resource. It makes for a ridiculously un-fun experience where most of the time you're ""playing"" you are actually trying to track down a specific companion to get a specific perk for a specific resource. Eventually you'll realize that you just are not having fun.

If you love the Disney movies & characters, I highly recommend giving this a try! :)

It's made with so much love, the characters are cute and funny, with many littles details that remind you of the movies. The mix between building your village, crafting and also exploring each characters story through quests, keeps me playing way more than I'd usually play with ACNH and other village games. I simply love the interaction with the characters and exploring their stories. They are fit into the game in a way that's new but also fitting to their movie set up. I also love to see how the characters interact with each other. 
And the soundtrack!!!! Really beautfiul arrangements with a lot of the Disney melodies that we all love :D

The one thing that can be a little bit overwhelming at times, is the amount of small tasks/ duties that get tracked and rewarded. Sometimes I find myself starting one task and then losing myself in doing 10 others, before actually getting back to what I originally wanted to do. But maybe that's just me. Also the item farming can sometimes be a little much, so be careful which items you sell, a lot of them are needed for various quests.:)

This game can be very addicting, I played for hours on hours straight with this game. 

Its not easy as well. You have to find recipes or try to create them yourself. You can also feed the animals that scutter around each area of the game, however you need to feed them the food they like. 
You can design your own house, buy furniture and so many clothes!
I love that it doesnt just stop after you have gotten all the disney characters to the valley as there are constant updates with new characters joining. 

It is a very fun game and you will definitely enjoy it :)

It has a very Stardew Valley mixed with Animal Crossing kinda vibe!

Pros:
- Its very customizable, especially compared to some other games of a similar genre. Lots of different clothing, hair, and furniture options.
-You can move pretty much everything almost anywhere!
-Lots to do, will keep you busy for hours!
-The graphics are very pretty! The game def looks straight outta a Disney movie!
-The mechanisms are very easy to understand and don't take long to learn.
-Its a very forgiving game. You don't really lose items and you're not really timed on anything. If you forget to water your crop, that's okay! Your crop is still all good!
-Resources are very easy to get, it doesn't require much waiting so you can pretty much just continuously farm materials if need be!

Cons:
-Pretty much everything and every task requires a decent amount of money to complete so it requires you do some repetitive tasks in order to get more money. Not too bad but can get kinda tedious.
-A good amount of bugs and glitches (glitching into walls, characters won't move when following you so you get stuck, items disappearing, etc). To be expected with an early access game, though.
-Some characters feel kinda flat? They feel like they lack personality., such as Minnie for example
-Very repetitive character idle animations/ dialogue, which can def give you a headache over time (watch out for Donald).

Even though there are some issues, I think its a very good game and would def recommend it to anyone who wants a chill, fun, laid-back experience!",1673512980,1673512980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game is fun enough to play a lot of hours. You might end up repeating the same type of task and you'll might need to grind a lot of the same materials to be able to finally do a quest you have awaiting for days/weeks.

Larger Form:
Honestly not worth it unless it’s a good deal. I got it on sale and it still wasn’t worth it to me- I only say this as it’s highly repetitive and not in the way that’s fun to me. I love games where you have to grind, but not in this form as it’s just a gameplay loop that isn’t very interesting (I’m also not a big disney fan, so I’m sure if you’re a big disney fan you’d find more enjoyment).

It's still in early access as of me writing this, so there are a few bugs that I've run into that make it a little frustrating to progress with certain character quests. (Mainly with Scrooge. I can't make signs for his shop and I literally just need TWO MORE, but the building option for it disappeared.) However, that's the only serious bug that I've come across! Earning coins and Dreamlight can be monotonous, and searching for specific materials can also be frustrating- (I can't tell you how long it took me to collect 30+ pieces of Hardwood and 2 regular Emeralds... Too long, man. Too long. I'll eat the next SHINY Emerald I run into.) But! The reward was always worth it to me. Expanding on my Valley and meeting and befriending new characters were always worth it.

I was worried that they would be an almost exact rip of Animal Crossing, (but with Disney characters,) since the concept was very similar. Yes, there are a lot of elements and functions that are similar, from placing houses for new residents and decorating your valley with furniture, placing pathing, taking pictures with your residents, mining and digging up resources, designing clothes, getting recipes for cooking food and building furniture, etc. But it has enough of a unique twist to it all that it does make it it's own thing. (It's not a shameful rip, is what I'm getting at.)

All-in-all, though I have my petty complaints, I really do love this game. It's got that perfect mix of relaxation and nostalgia that it warms my heart. The music is lovely, the daily conversations with characters are unique and fun, the lore and mystery mixed in with the valley is interesting and cool- I'd honestly recommend if for everyone of all ages. I think everyone would have a good time with this. :)

It's lovely, peaceful and very relaxing. 

The gameplay feels a bit like My Time at Portia, but with Disney characters. The graphics are likewise, too.
You must fish, gather, mine, and grow resources, which are used to build various objects needed for your quests.

There are times when you need to find hidden items, cook meals, or fetch items requested by other characters.
You can furnish your house and the map with over 1000 different furniture items, and you can customize your character with over 700 clothing, hairstyle and accessory items. There should be something for everyone. 

I think the main difference to My Time at Portia is that there is no combat. 
Dreamlight Valley is safe to play, even for young kids. 

Voice acting and music are both very enjoyable. 
The world design is nice, even if I wish it was a bit larger. 

Some people wrote that the game was grindy, but I didn't feel like it was. Of course some things need more resources than others, but isn't that the case in all games with item crafting? 

The game is in early access, but the only bugs I personally noticed were: 
 - Characters that spent time with me occasionally got stuck in a rock while I tried to mine. 
 - At the end of Buzz's quest ""The Definition of a Hero"" the game completely froze. After closing it via task manager and restarting it, the game continued to run fine, tho.  

I loved playing the game as you can tell, but there are also so minor issues that bothered me:

Donald. He is annoying. He keeps getting anger attacks where he throws himself to the ground and speaks gibberish. The first few times it's funny, but he keeps doing it so often that I sometimes wish that I could just remove or drown him. 

Some of the quests. Most of them are fine, but there are some that can only be done / completed at certain times of the day. The game's daytime is connected to your real-life daytime, so if you're playing at, let's say 8 in the morning, it will also be 8am in the game. 
There's a quest that requires you to do tasks in the morning, during the day, and in the evening.
So if you're not able to play the game at this time, well, sucks to be you, I guess? 

At first, you'll be overwhelmed by quests from all the characters. However, when you reach the end game, it feels as if the developers padded the playtime with unnecessary waiting.
For example some seeds will need a few real-life days to grow. Some quests lock each other out, so you can't even do some of the other quests while you wait. 

Dear developers: That's annoying. Just remove this nonsense. 

[h1] Overall, Disney's Dreamlight Valley offers a lot. Currently in early access there are already about 60 hours of quests, tons of customization options, a lot of lovely characters, beautiful scenery and music. There is no violence, so the game is suitable for children. 
The only things I would like to see in the future are more quests and more characters, as well as the removal of the annoying ""wait a few days"" interruptions. Maybe add some Achievements?
I'm aware that the game is going to be free2play someday, but I believe right now it's well worth the current price of 29,99. [/h1]",1673344313,1673395690,True,66,2,0.829497456550598145,5,True,False,True

So far I'm really liking the game, when I first bought it I played it for like 3 days straight, it gets addictive fast (in a good way) 
When playing games that have a character creation option, I always check if there is a hijab option since im a hijabi myself. The mere fact it even has a sporty hijab makes me very happy. Thank you for that inclusion.

What I do hope that will come in future updates, is that there will be a clock somewhere we can see while walking through the Valley as some critters only appear on a certain time and day. Also please make the Raccoons and crocodiles less skittish, I tried getting close to them when their heads are low, but the moment I get bit closer they get scared and well the opportunity to give them snacks to befriend them.

Kudos for giving a streamer friendly option so when gamers decide to stream the game they wont get slapped with a DMCA.

I hope that in future updates we also get to see Pirates of the Caribbean in the game and Hercules, seeing the pirate motives in the villains section really makes me hope for a Jack Sparrow in the game or Davy Jones. 

Game wise it is easy to understand, fishing took a bit to master, but when you know when to click it is very easy. I do hope there will be an option where we can configure keys ourselves for when I'm playing another game to grab items or interact with people is a different key and the E key is used for using a skill, the amount of times where I pressed E only to see my character not picking anything up in that game is endless, funny to notice though haha.

I loved previous games in the series, however they were some time ago - making me wonder if my taste in games had just completely changed over the years as everyone else had seemed to be enjoying the game.

I love Disney, so I was definitely intrigued by this game and picked it up fairly early, however I didn't touch it until fairly recently as I was a bit hesitant in case I didn't enjoy it. After finding my 3DS a month or so ago and getting back into New Leaf and having a lot of fun, I finally caved and started playing Dreamlight Valley a couple of weeks ago and overall, I am really enjoying it so far!

A lot of the issues I personally had with New Horizons aren't really prevalent at all in this game - such as tools just randomly deciding to break, or the need to time travel, with the most frustrating part for me just being when certain characters you want to hang out with are asleep. This game really brings the wholesome, nostalgic Disney magic to the classic chill game genre and really just enhances the overall experience! The story aspect is also a really cool part to the game, as you have a main story you're able to follow alongside doing your regular tasks in the village. The idea of this game constantly evolving to add new characters by the time the game reaches it's full release, as well as alongside future Disney/Pixar movie releases is also really exciting. The number of unmarked doors in the castle is insane and I'm looking forward to see where this game goes next and which characters will be coming to the Valley!

The customisation in game is also really cool, there's so many options for your character appearance and a custom clothing editor is a really nice addition to allow for unique designs - it'd be really cool if these could be shared online with other players in the full release of the game! There's also a lot of ways you can customise your village. Since I'm still not *that* far through the game yet, my village isn't the prettiest, but it'll get there eventually - when I get further through the game, I imagine I'll have more resources to spare towards crafting things to make it all pretty.

Since the game is still in early access, there are a few bugs in the game at the moment - something to definitely be aware of. The bugs I've encountered haven't been super annoying or game breaking, more just inconveniences that fix themselves after restarting the game. 

Considering this game is in early access at the moment, this game is a lot of fun and I'm just super excited to see where it goes next :)",1673239398,1673239398,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros:
This game feels like it should be a cash grab but it isn't yet. (keyword: yet)
It has that classic Disney charm which you can find everywhere, but you can also find personal touches here and there throughout the world through the decorations that aren't linked to Disney. 
Unlocking new characters, objects, and recipes gives me a dopamine rush.
It is a lot like animal crossing but farming is more efficient in every way possible as well as the full camera turn for your fov. It is so nice I might have trouble returning the animal crossing.
Cons/ eh:
It's going to be free when it fully releases in the worst way, which is very evident based on the ""star path"" (basically battle pass) the game changes every one or two months. The star path is especially irritating because I might never get to have some of my favorite Pixar items in the game due to missing out on them from the first star pass. 
Progression also kind of sucks when you see what a character or the star pass gives you at a certain level and its a dress. Why can't there be a gender neutral equivalent with the same design? This can also be said for men's wear like tuxedos or suits. 
Being free also means you are giving them money for the in game currency and some exclusive items from the pack you buy unless they give founders more love after they make it free.
There are glitches and I know there are some game-breaking ones which I may have already ran into because the rat won't join me in the restaurant. ((fuck you Remy)(wait I didn't mean it Remy I actually really like the cooking mechanics please forgive me))
After spending hours in the game I've noticed it gets grindy as well. 

Disney Dreamlight is an overall a nice game but there are several flaws that need to be addressed.

Yes it can be glitchy at times, I had to completely restart to a new save to fix some (only a few hours in), but it hasn't been game ending and it's still in Beta.  I will admit I prefer Stitch's quests to everyone else's, but that's only because of how they set it up.  I think the game needs more slow down mechanics for the quests.  I had everyone unlocked and fully leveled in well under a week of playing, it was WAY too easy.  If they could implement the same style of quest-line as Stitch where you had to wait a day or so between doing them, I think that would help slow down the process and give more longevity to the game.  I can't wait for the next update and I'm enjoying the overarching storyline.  Just be careful when you're playing; if you notice your game is glitched early on, just delete the save and restart, it fixed mine :)

DON'T BUY for this simple reason:

only 20 characters in the game, from a dozen movies, which means not all Disney characters are in. Some you see in game trailer aren't even in the game yet! I bought the game because I wanted to see them all, but it's not happening after couple 70 hours of playtime.

WAIT UNTIL GAME IS FINISHED.

I uninstalled because I don't feel to finish last 10% of the game. Game has potential, but now it's just a waste of time.

I bought House Flipper, and never went back to Disney Dreamlight Valley.

Pros:
- it's cool that there can be lot's of character customization
- seeing Disney characters
- graphics

Cons:
- House customization very limited inside and outside
- Takes time to increase in-game money until you realize you better save specific characters first in order to sell what they can give you for free without doing the work.
- character glitches here and there, not too many
- character build customization too non-gender. Player's male and female character walks and runs the same, which is a bit weird really (it's not normal period and gay pride arguments aren't valid, especially for kid's game). 
- Able to dress character with opposite gender clothes and no filter for easier selection and finding. I had to wait long time before being able to get a decent clothing fit.

Great game, but I paid to enjoy the beta and so...its a beta. BUT, when it is final, it will be free to play.

Characters in your town level up and actually have a use other than just inhabiting your world

It focuses very heavily on getting new outfits and decorating your home & village. The game play mostly consists of walking around collecting stuff on the ground, but the visuals and environment is quite nice.

If you ever want a game to play that feels like the equivalent of taking a walk in the woods after a stressful day, then this is your ticket.

--Previous Review--
Surprisingly frequent game-breaking bugs for a $50 game. Frequently get stuck after dialogues with characters if that dialogue caused us to level up our friendship. Only way out is Alt-F4 and then I lose any progress since my last save. The game play itself is incredibly basic too and seems to be a Disney themed Animal Crossing with fewer features.

By casual, I mean that you can simply start the game whenever you are in the mood for something relaxed, with the game offering you plenty of things to do. None of those things are challenging, but just very soothing and easy. 

I have no idea what way they will go with the monetization - right now, whenever you run out of energy, you just walk into your house and tadah, energy bar refilled. Not sure what kind of monetization mechanics they'll add later on, I guess we'll see. 

So you spend the day farming, fishing, foraging, doing the quests for the NPCs, thereby adding new citizens to the valley, whether it's classic characters like Donald or newer ones such as Wall-E. 

Later on, the game tends to be a bit grindy. When it comes to unlocking new areas, leveling the buildings or some quests which require you to farm a bunch of items for crafting - you'll be busy. 

And here is where my main point of criticism comes in - the very small inventory space, both in your backpack and in your house. At first, it seems to be big enough, but once you have quest items in there for quests you can't finish yet, ingredients or stuff you pick up for crafting - I at some point spent a LOT of time juggling my inventory, dropping items etc. You can later pick those up again, but the lack of inventory space (even though the space in your house gets bigger once you upgrade your house, which becomes pretty expensive) feels really old-fashioned. 

Other than that, I had some problems with switching menus (resulting in empty menu pages, requiring a restart) and a problem where I couldn't enter certain houses because I was on a certain quest... I had to finish that first, but it took me a bit of google-ing to figure this out. 

Well - in summary, it's a very relaxed cute game (so cute it may give you a sugar-shock at some point), great for just spending some time while listening to audiobooks or podcasts. It can be slightly addictive, is quite well-made and I hope this wont be turned into some insanely monetized cash-grab later on.

I have actually played other Disney games like it in the past, mainly Disney Magical World and Disney Infinity, and it's similar to those games in some ways (character customization, tasks, plot, interior decoration) and different in others (good gameplay). I really like the ""farming sim"" aspects of the game like cooking, crafting, fishing, farming, and building relationships. The mechanics for all of these are really fun and don't make you wait a billion hours for things to happen. Fishing is as soon as you find some bubbles, cooking and crafting are instant, and crops grow while you're doing other things. Even friendship is easy to build, I just took Moana fishing for like an hour and maxed out our friendship.

My favorite part of this game is character customization. The character models in this game are really good, and especially the payer's model. Some of the eyelash options are weird, but no complaints otherwise. And as a transgender payer, it was nice that either male or female main characters could choose any hairstyle or clothing piece. The only things gender-locked are traits like eyes and jawlines. Not only that, but the other characters don't really use pronouns for the main character, so regardless of what you choose the experience will be gender-inclusive for the most part.

You can't romance any of the characters, which makes sense, but remember that there IS a Disney dating sim already, so they COULD HAVE... my only criticism is that the game doesn't let me smooch. You can have a ""best friend"" though, which is a nice touch and something I will be using interchangeably with the word ""husband"", historian-style. The game is kinda glitchy but for something that hasn't even been publicly released yet is absolutely baller. Most glitches aren't super noticeable or happen rarely, and I haven't had anything crash or soft-lock me yet. Game isn't broken, will likely be patched to be even more solid though.

Also, if anybody was worried about whether this game is pay-to-win, don't be. I did spend money because I was curious, but it ultimately does not affect the gameplay or your progression. Not only are the paid currency, the ""moon coins"", only tied to cosmetic items, but you can also earn them in-game without spending a penny. So this game is not pay-to-win, the micro-transactions are not egregious, and there is little in-game advertisement for you to buy things with real money. It definitely isn't giving mobile game energy, this is a well polished game that, honestly, I would pay for as-is.

TLDR; 8/10, minor glitches and some cosmetics behind paywall, but great graphics and gameplay overall. Quality game, not just Disney bait.",1672679515,1672679515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You can sell your produce and findings for money to upgrade your shops and house too.
The game is rewarding, you get given furniture for completing quests or new outfits.
Scoodge has a store which you can buy items of furniture, clothes etc.

I've played a decent amount of Animal Crossing, but I usually lose interest pretty quick because I prefer to sit and play for hours instead of checking in for a bit then moving on. Plus the amount of customization I was given in New Horizons was honestly a bit intimidating, especially when everyone was showing off their crazy well designed islands. This game has, so far, been good at giving me plenty to do, specific goals to complete, and a generous amount of customization without being overwhelming. Plus, so far I've only encountered two events that were gated by real world days, one of which there is apparently a legitimate ""short cut"" that can still take you a few hours if you don't have the right resources already stocked (I even made the short cut item and I still have to wait for this plant to dry out and hope the rain doesn't water it before I can, at this rate I might end up waiting the full time anyway since I was already a few days in when I learned about the short cut).

For those who are reasonably concerned about the premium currency in the game, so far it has been super unnecessary, the only benefit is unlocking more event cosmetics and items, no pay to win, and quite frankly I've gotten enough from within the game without paying that I could afford a month of premium, with plenty of currency left over. If you're considering the premium DLC, I'd only worry about it if you're a completionist or really like some of the cosmetics that come with it, you don't really need the premium currency right now.

Overall, I'm really happy with where the game is right now, and I'm looking forward to future releases!

Earlier this year I got heavily into Animal Crossing, and I put about 55 hours into it in the span of a month, putting in 2 to 3 hours into it a day. it was extremely fun and I was playing it every morning. Eventually I wanted to try and see if Animal Crossing was on PC. It was in fact, not on PC. So for about a week or so I began looking around for any PC games that had similar game-play or vibes that you get from Animal Crossing. I came across two games that play and feel exactly like Animal Crossing, which is a game called Cozy Grove and this game. This game, at first, I was afraid was going to play like another Sims like game. But I was taken aback to find that it plays rather more like Animal Crossing with some more 3D Role-Play like elements. Not top down, but rather you control your character in 3rd person. And I have absolutely fallen in love with it, putting in 43 hours of game-time in the span of 3 days. 

Another thing I quite enjoy is that it feels like a living, breathing game. Similar to AC, the world changes, shifts and more things unlock when you come back everyday. The day and night cycle goes in real time. The characters always have something new to share and tell you. You can spend time with them and hangout with them with many rewards. You really get to spend time with and get to know your favorite Disney characters.

As of right now, the game has only a handful of characters in the game. But I bet with future updates, they will add more items, mechanics, and characters. Somethings I want added are certain clothes and accessories like umbrellas for when it rains, maybe a pet shop of some kind, and maybe allowing us to have multiplayer like AC does where you can visit each others islands! There is a lot they are still slowly adding with time, after-all it only came out September of 2022 (which at the time of this review was very recently)
-------
Ill go into some of the aspects of the game and touch base on it overall. I would like to say that I grew up on Kingdom Hearts, so getting into a game like this was not difficult and actually super fun and exciting.

The music:
Is very Disney like and super relaxing, some of it is original pieces for the game. And sometimes you can hear a little melody of respective songs for certain characters like the MICKEY MOUSE CLUB song, How Far I'll Go from Moana, Part of Your World from Little Mermaid, etc etc. Sometimes I like to turn off the music and listen to Kingdom Hearts songs for a little variety and it fits just as well! Other times I like to just stand there for a while, not doing anything and just listen to the music and ambiance of the game, it's very relaxing to just stand there and take it all in.

Graphics:
Beautiful! If you love the Disney aesthetic, you will ADORE this game. The day and night cycle go beautifully with the world and be if its day or night it's always a very beautiful game and has a magical feel to it, I find myself at times just stopping and taking a bunch of pictures because it all looks so pretty! Though after a while some of it may look too familiar. But don't worry you can shake things up by decorating the entire valley and making it look different! I've had so much fun decorating in this game and I can't wait to obtain more furniture in future updates.

Animation/Movements: 
For the most part, seamless! But I think most of the problems come from the characters. Sometimes the Disney characters will lag or get stuck on something. Sometimes when you're talking to them and they do certain animations, their eyes will glitch and get sucked into their face or disappear. But overall, it doesn't happen a lot and doesn't take away from the experience. 

HUD/UI:
It's so simple and clean, everything is tucked away nice and neat and in their respective spots. Nothing ever gets in the way and is an eyesore. But sometimes I get glitches where a quest will pop up and it wont go away, such as QUEST START or QUEST COMPLETED and the only way to remove it is if I press ESC and ESC again for it to disappear from my screen. And sometimes my game will have a hard time keeping up and freeze or break in a certain cutscene, and I just have to restart the game.

Characters:
They are all brilliant, they feel and act just like their cartoon counterparts. And sometimes they will make the occasional reference to their own movies. Mother Gothel at times talks to you as if she were talking to Rapunzel. It's always fun talking to Mickey and the gang. 

Minnie Mouse is best mouse.

Story:
Oh yes, there is story! And its pretty fun, as long as you lose yourself to your childhood wonder and don't think about it too harshly. It's a fairly Disney storyline (go figure) and it does indeed progress, even with the characters individual stories tying in to the main narrative at times! As the trailer said, the Forgetting settled into the Valley, making everything dark and dreary, it made a bunch of the Disney characters leave and forget about who they are and forget about the Valley. So your goal is to bring life back into the Valley, bring the Disney characters back home and help them remember. Its another Light vs Darkness kind of story, which also gives me huge Kingdom Hearts flashbacks... (which, if you like Disney, I recommend playing it, seriously). Down the line you slowly make the darkness go away and try to get on top of what.. or who... is causing all of this while decorating all the while! It's a wonderful game that all ages can enjoy honestly.

Mechanics/Gameplay:
For the most part, you will be doing a lot of Animal Crossing stuff. Balancing a lot of things in your day to day and choosing what to do that day. You can progress stories, get Dreamlight by doing daily duties (kinda like Nook Miles+) and even get a bunch of materials for decorating or progression. Your main tools are the magic watering can, pickaxe, fishing-rod, and shovel. They are magic because they never break and run out. You use these to do well.. what they are used for! And you get a lot of items when you go out and use these often. And let me tell you, doing all of them are very relaxing. Gardening and fishing are two of my personal favorites in the game, they are relaxing to do. HOWEVER, you have a stamina bar that you need to replenish very often in order to continue doing any of these things. By doing that, you need to cook and eat. So stock up on a lot of cooking supplies... and GET REMY! (Yes, the Rat from the Rat movie) the disney characters you surround yourself with can also help you! You can give them a specific role after leveling them up to level 2 of either: gardening, fishing, mining, foraging, or digging. When you choose to hangout with them, they will level up as you do activities, and they will give you extra materials when you do the role you gave them. And the more characters with the same role, the more items you can collect.

Overall:
I would say it is an amazing 8 or 9 out of 10 game. Sometimes there are some glitches and sometimes I need to wait a little to spawn in at times. Sometimes the characters get stuck and I have to restart the game, other times stuff can get stuck on the other side of places that I cant reach in the story yet. So some bugs suck. But it only happens 10% of the time I've played and none of it dampens on my mood when I play. Overall, I have had a lot of fun and it is one of the most relaxing games I have played next to Cozy Grove and Animal Crossing, it's a great stand in, and it honestly has been able to fill in my childhood dreams of getting to meet Disney characters and be my own little Disney Princess.

I very rarely buy EA, but I bought this game in EA because a) it was on Steam sale, and b) I read in online reviews that it was basically a fully released game with new content slowly being rolled out. I'm not sure I agree with ""b.""

Now, this game is 100% worth it if you just want a chill game to putter around with, you're not overly bothered by bugs/incomplete features, and/or you want access to the special items in the EA-period holidays (e.g., the Halloween items, the Christmas outfits, etc.).

On the other hand, there are a number of bugs and issues still in the game, and the devs have zero active presence on Steam at the time of this review, which is very different from other EA games I've played. Some of the issues are so repetitive/pervasive that a Steam user named love-less_beloved has created an independent and unfortunately unpinnable Bug/Fixes Compilation Megathread ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/1401590/discussions/0/6382186451006770090/] Link to thread [/url]). They deserve Steam-props and cookies, but this really should have been a dev function.

Most of the existing bugs result in annoyance, minor item/opportunity loss in-game, or maybe 5-10 minutes of lost progress, but some are more serious. I'm sure that most will be resolved in upcoming patches, so if you're bothered by things like this, it might be better to wait and buy the game in another month or two (or whenever it's out of EA altogether).

I'll revise this review when the bugs that most irritate me are addressed or the game comes out of EA.",1672600748,1672600748,False,2,0,0.515393376350402832,0,True,False,True

The replay value even if you've completed the quests is totally there too- there is so much creativity and control over how your valley looks. One common complaint is that it's too easy to max out your level and the levels of the characters, but I can see this either being solved by the devs or becoming irrelevant because of the sheer amount of characters they will be adding (think of all of the Disney-owned franchises.... so many possibilities!)

Only gripe is that this game is aimed at grown-ups.
My eight year old son loves seeing his favourite characters and helping them. But there's a few things... off... about his experience.

Firstly, there's no child avatars: he's forced to play as a full-grown man!

Secondly, the dialog is too long-winded for children. He wants to help the characters, get a simple instruction / thanks, then on to the next thing. But there's way too much reading at the moment to keep a child's attention. And most of that dialog isn't necessary either: just fluff. Clicking through 5 pages of dialog that could easily be reduced to 2 without losing any of the great story immersion.

So you might find children under 10 getting a bit bored with the whole experience.

Additionally, there's way more content for female avatars than male. At least three of the final character quests involve a pretty dress as the reward. He was a bit disappointed with that too",1672588857,1672588857,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

1. The option to change Companion Roles.
I want my villagers to have a role according to their character/personality, but sometimes I uhh, accidentally assigned them to the wrong role. I mean, it wouldn't make sense for Moana to specialize in mining or Scar in gardening. Yes I do think that there should be a limit on changing the roles, it would be unfair to just change a character's role whenever convenient to just get the level 10 all the time. Maybe 1x every 3 days you can change one character's role.
Alternatively, have them pre-assigned role that fits their theme the most with unique abilities (if there are enough characters).

2. GET OUT OF THE WAY, MICKEY, I'M TRYING TO HARVEST THE CROPS THAT CAN BE HARVESTED MULTIPLE TIMES I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU! GOSH DARN IT NOW I ACCIDENTALLY PLANTED A CARROT. AAAAND the super harvest thing is gone...
Maybe have a separate button for harvesting and talking/planting, or a special mode where E always harvests and not talk or plant.

3. Resources Drops
Ironically, the best way to get hardwood, is straight up deforestation and putting smaller trees in one place to harvest the hardwood. I find this stupid, considering some quests has ridiculous resources requirements. If possible, please increase the hardwood spawn so that people won't have to keep relying on deforestation, making Forest of Valor looks like Some Small Trees in One Place of Valor.

4. Outfit and Furniture Loadouts
It would be great to be able to have outfit loadouts so that if I want to change in a particular set of outfit, I don't have to manually change every single piece of clothing.
Also the same applies with furniture, it would be great to be able to have a loadout set so that I can change the mood of the house without having to remove and replace every single furniture.

5. Friendship Level & Character Level Prestige
As for now, there is no point in giving gifts to villagers that has level 10 friendship except for quests and duties. It would be great if there are extra friendship prestige meter that can be filled up at level 10 friendship, giving you rewards on each completion, maybe some coins or random goods. Also for the player character's level as well, it'd be great to get extra rewards for getting XP above max level.

6. Maui, get your big bum out of the way, I'm trying to walk through.
Yes, sometimes NPCs cannot be pushed out of the way, effectively blocking the path. can be fixed with NPCs always being pushable or straight up walked through.

The characters, story, and life this game brings is amazing. My childhood characters are brought to life within the game play. Helping Remy cook or teaching Donald Anger Management Strategies. Seeing them all walk around is adorable. I would seriously injury any who messes with WALL-E and his precious boot that he likes to offer you. The game play is very grindy, but well worth it. The time passes by in a heartbeat. I got this game Dec 26th, I am now 53 hours in on Dec 31st.

This game is in early access, but I love it to pieces. I hit bugs or glitches every couple hours, sometimes back to back, sometimes never. A quick shutdown of the game and rebooting fixes the problem. I have never had an issue with saves being set far back since the game saves quite often.",1672513484,1672513484,True,35,6,0.702644944190979004,0,True,False,True

For being casual, there's a lot to do and a surprising amount of depth. It's a LOT like Stardew Valley. There's farming, gathering, fishing, friendship levels with all of the other characters, mining, cooking, and decorating your home and avatar. There are a variety of quest chains and the game is generally not picky about what order you do them in. 

The good: first, off, it's really cheerful. The game never makes you feel like you've failed or are doing a bad job. And the characters are.... well, Disney. They manage to be happy, enthusiastic, and supportive without triggering my cynicism. There's easter eggs everywhere. The music is a pleasant ambiance, and the graphics are pretty. 

When I think casual game, I think of something with very limited interaction. Here, there's a lot to do. What's casual about this game a lack of urgency. For example, crops can dry out and stop growing, but they never die and it rains from time to time. Eventually your Okra is going to be ready to harvest no matter how neglectful you are. And while there's no game mechanic like a day/night cycle forcing you to do time management, there's also no mechanic like tiredness forcing you to limit time spent on an activity. Spawn rates seem to gradually drop temporarily if you keep mining the same handful of nodes, for example, but only enough to make you a bit less efficient. Not enough to make it useless.

The map feels a lot bigger than it is. Each zone has a teleporter (which you can move) but they're small enough that I often find it's just as fast to walk between them. It doesn't feel like one spends a lot of time walking from place to place. Tools don't wear out and your character doesn't need sleep. So there's nothing to interrupt you or slow you down if you just want to keep doing some activity. There's just not much in the way of time sinks or interruptions to make you stop playing the way you want to play.

The quest system is broken into two parts. There are story-driven quests for every character as well as each zone, plus the grand arc. While linear in their own right, the order in which you do them doesn't seem to matter. Don't feel like rescuing Donald at the moment? Go bring back WALL-E or restore a zone's pillar. It's more or less open world in that regard. Or, if that's just too much responsibility at the moment, there's a second type of quests which are a rotating board of 8 simple tasks, such as catch 3 fish. You can let your attention deficit bounce you from activity to activity for a few short minutes at a time.

The ""bosses"" are either tasks or puzzles. By and large the puzzles aren't too difficult and there's a fair amount of clues to help you out. The most complicated system is the cooking and the worst possible outcome is you get something other than what you were trying to make.

The bad:  if you need negative reinforcement in your games, there simply isn't any here.  Pathfinding is pretty solid (I've seen an NPC get themselves unstuck by varying their direction of movement until they were free). However, your helpers can interfere with some of the bonus events. For example, a crop will sometimes give a bonus where it lets you keep harvesting it over and over for 5 seconds or so. If you have an assistant, they have this irritating habit of walking on top of the crop making a dialog open when you're trying to quickly harvest, or of leveling up and taking you to a cut scene. 

While very playable and with a lot of content already, there's quite a bit not yet finished. You can decorate your home, but they haven't implemented all the features, such as changing out doors. The voice acting clips are quite limited. There are clearly some missing cut scenes. Etc.

It's still a bit buggy. An inconvenient timing of an NPC leveling up their friendship can break a dialog and force you to exit and come back into the game. Activities don't always trigger completion with quests. These aren't frequent, but in 30+ hours I've hit them maybe five times. So you'll notice them. And in a very few instances you can break a quest chain by completing an activity before you hit that stage of the quest. This is almost always solved by repeating the activity, so it's annoying but not game breaking.

The camera is probably the largest weakness I've noticed. You can't really zoom in or out, and it tends to be a bit too close to your avatar making it hard to get perspective on what's around you. 

Final analysis: This game is simply delightful escapism. And if you're a Disney fan there's going to be a lot of little smiles as familiar friends, objects, and story elements appear. Clearly a lot of Love and attention to detail have gone into this and it definitely pays off. I found it neither boring nor stressful, just happy and fun.",1672438002,1672438002,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

I love how much you can customize your character and your environment. They may have bit off more than they can chew, but the story is interesting and complicated. It's even a bit dark for a Disney game, but that just makes it more compelling. In this beta edition though, the story doesn't resolve. 

It has a ton of potential, but, in beta, it never quite reaches that potential. It is monotonous at times. Sometimes you have to spend days gathering flowers or iron to progress. It doesn't quite bring the flexibility or low stakes of animal crossing. The plot is interesting, but unresolved. The quests are often a pain. The engine is amazing!

We play this together in our living room with a DualSense through my docked Steam Deck - I look stuff up and occasionally take over controller duties, but mostly I'm happy to help. Where this shines is the IP crossover (if you're not open to a Disney-oriented game or want to bemoan that aspect in particular, actually get over yourself lmao) and the amount of actual things to do rather than ""I guess just make your own fun and also all of you stuff breaks so deal with it"" artificial difficulty and barriers added to gameplay. Are there other, equally arbitrary barriers to progression added? Sure, but we both happen to like scratching the itch of doing tasks rather than just doing thankless busywork that doesn't amount to anything but your own satisfaction. That's way too close to reality and I do not fw that. We actually feel like we're making progress in Dreamlight Valley and with the characters in it, and that's big.

To be sure, it's early access, there is still stuff to be added and patched. On Steam Deck, I couldn't even get past the intro cinematic without it crashing until I changed the properties around so that the game would launch in Proton > Experimental. From then on, I've had minimal hangs and we've been cruising. I could and will die for Little Chef.

An earlier reviewer mentioned being the target demographic for this game. I'm almost a decade older and I feel the same way. I remember being six years old and renting Adventures in the Magic Kindom for the NES with my Mom. The same year, I watched the magic castle at Disneyland light up from on top of my Uncle's shoulders. I was the same age my nephew is now. 

I enjoy the post-mid 90's Disney movies well enough, but they just don't hold the same nostalgia for me. When you can remember The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King coming out in a five-year span, it's difficult not to be critical of modern Disney. Except for the dog in Up... he might be the best character of all time.

Anyways, this game is so good that doesn't matter.

I won't go on about everything I love about the game, as most of the reviews have done a great job of that already. It has that vibrant, cartoonish look of Fable or Kingdoms of Amalur, but it plays like an Animal Crossing game. So far, with almost 40 hours of play time, I've only come across a few minor issues:

- I've had to force close a couple times due to my companion being stuck between myself and a doorway when trying to exit.
- With my gamepad, pressing RB until you arrive at the last tab freezes the menu so that you can't go back to a previous tab by pressing LB.
- PLEASE give us an option to untuck shirts from pants. I have a hoodie on at all times so I don't feel like Steve Urkel running around the valley.

As you can see, these are all very minor and I'm sure they'll be patched out quickly... well maybe not the shirts. I've got a wishlist like every other player, but based on the amount of blank plaques in the castle, we've only seen a very small piece of an already incredibly immersive early access release.

2022 was one of the most difficult years of my life. I'll spare you the details because it seems like everyone is struggling right now, but suffice it to say I spent most of it in a very dark place. The world at large seems to be fixed in a state of aggression and disagreement.

Disney Dreamlight Valley reminds me to slow down and remember how I once looked at the world: with some optimism and positive sense of community; and that is priceless going into 2023.

I was worried that I would get bored with this likr I did with Animal Crossing. Sure, I have hundreds of hours in AC and only close to 13 hours in Dreamlight Valley as of writing this review, but it's already for AC trumped by the fact it has quests in it. It's very much like AC and Stardew Valley had a baby, and the baby was everything disney. It's a great binge and relax game. The quests make it so you can do more in a day than you can in AC, where I felt that after doing your daily stuff of talking to villagers and getting the shops, it would get boring. There's always something to do keep you busy. 

There is FISHING which i love in any game. And cooking too.

I can't wait to see what new things they bring in terms of characters and areas if they do that. I hope so.

If you said yes, buy Disney Dreamlight Valley.  DDV doesn't play exactly like those titles, but its similar enough in genre that if you enjoy the gameplay loop of farming, cooking, talking to villagers, etc, you'll find plenty to enjoy here.  You also have the added bonus of interacting with some excellent characters, and going through a rather interesting main story-line quest.

The game isn't finished, so you wont be finishing the main quest yet, but there's still hours of content here.  In addition, the road-map seems to be a new major content drop every two months.  The devs have been very regular with that, and they're reasonably quick to patch up any bugs updates might introduce.  I've been very happy with the time I've spent in-game.

The only thing that's concerning is the possibility for in-game MTX.  So far, you can purchase moonstones (or use the ones in your founders pack) to get the bi-monthly star path.  Think like a battlepass, except challenges are things like ""Cook ten five star meals"", ""Spend an hour with Scar"" and ""Mine fifteen gems"".  All very easy to do stuff you'll be doing anyways.  You can buy said star path, and spend more moonstones to advance through it without doing the challenges.   That's it.  No other optional items are available.  My only concern is that when the game pivots to free-to-play, higher quality items will go down the ""pay with real money only"" path.  Until then though, your founders pack will more than supply you with enough content, and moonstones, to do everything the game has to offer for quite some time.

Its a wonderful game, surprised me to see Disney do something this nice. The only issue i have ran into was the Wall-E bug and all i had to do was restart.

Animal crossing failed with their system to get people to come back. It was supposed to over grow and mess up your island.

Honestly, this game works better than my prescription meds to get through my seasonal depression. The game is light-hearted and fun, and no imminent danger at all to be worried about. I've seen a lot of reviews about ""this is not even embarrassing to be playing as an adult"" and I can 100% agree. This game really is meant for everyone! There are (currently) some minor bugs, such as freezing during dialogue -- but the game autosaves so often that if you need to alt + F4, you'll lose MAYBE the last 5 minutes, if that. You'll be fine. There is also a ton of story and quests to work through before you reach the ""end"" of the available content -- and even then, its in EARLY ACCESS, so there is so much more to come! I'm really loving this game, and I totally recommend it if you like cozy, casual games.

Way too many bugs and annoyances ti recommend at this time.

Donald fall on his face and has an annoying train flute sound as he gets a ragefit every 10 steps

Maui just walks in front of you and does the same boring animations endlessly

the toys when harvesting and having them as a companion will walk in front of you and you start talking with them than picking up the bonus glowing vegetables

The puzzle pieces gets stuck and you can't exit it, and you're forced to force quit it

Mother gothel also won't shut up and say the same boring shit over and over

And they nerfed kristoff's stall.

the switch version runs as terrible as it did 3 monhts ago with freezes and horrible fps, same with steam deck. Game is clearly capped at 2 cores max, which is a huge bottleneck as it's barely capable of running on lowest and hit 60 fps.. 
_________________________

Finally a good to-be free to play game! Yes, you pay now, but will eventually get the game as free to play. So this is more a paid beta, and after 20 hours, i just can't put the damn game down! So much to do, so many characters to help, so many worlds to visit!, so much work to do to get the dreamlight valley how i want it to be!

I was super skeptical because gameloft made the game, and gameloft has been ""gamelost"" in the pit of free to pay pay to do anything with ads to the tits of ""pay for this, pay for that"" nonsense for the past 7 years!

As they used to deliver great clones like crysis clone aka nova triology now lost to the past and not updated to enjoy today because they only care about free to play money laundering nonsense today, same with shadow guardian being uncharted/tomb raider clone. But this game really nailed it on entertainment/enjoyment with very very minimal stuff you pay real money for! 

So gameloft, if you're reading this, PLEASE, bring back the old classic mobile games from their lost and forgotten graves. Hell, even re-release them on consoles/pc and i'll gladly repurchase them! Cause those old gems is what we seek in games, pay once, play forever. None of that rubbish free to play with paywalls up to the third floor!

When you play this game, you forget about time and it gets 4 in the morning you know you have a gem here. There is absolutely no combat, just pure zen. This game takes you to your happy place, your child hood and more. With light Disney instrumental music playing in the background, some of which you can't help to sing along to. The quests this game provides is brilliant. Some MMO's I have played can learn from this. Its not just fetch quests... Its.. Build something here, go meet a character there, fix Moana's boat and its not just go fetch the stuff to fix the boat, you have to look almost everywhere for the mats and then go to your workbench and build stuff. Its brilliant. 

There is a few cons to this game for someone like me coming from Animal crossing. Animal Crossing has this ""auto target"" mechanic built into the game when you want to harvest something it targets the correct thing for you to harvest. Here with Dreamlight valley, you just need to stand on top or point your character in the general direction. Its sounds ok, but really... its not. Sometimes you just want to grab a rock and than there's a plant next to it and you grab the plant. This game can really improve on this as well as when you pick something up that it actually says ""pick up dandelion"" and not JUST pick up.
Another improvement I would like to see is in your character's movement. I obviously play a male character so my male character move a little feminine with a bit of a broom stick up his you know what.

Another mention is.. I have played this game on Xbox Series X with Game Pass and it way more buggier there, but not unplayable. For early Access I guess PC (Steam) is the way to go for now.

Much can change. This is an early access game, but...

My first thought was: ""Wow a decent looking Disney game"" On the other hand, I was very very VERY skeptical about the quality of this game, because when I saw it's by GAMELOFT (I am literally allergic to this developer because of their games and monetization), I was like ""No way the game has such good rating on Steam"".

Winter sale started and when I saw the Ultimate Edition bundle was 50% off (I thought that this was a good deal to me), I decided to give it a try and holy moly. This game could be summarized with: Animal Crossing but with Disney characters.
I thought I'd get bored before I hit 1 hour. But there's a lot to do and many quests. You can:

- Do gardening
- Mine minerals
- Harvest crops
- Go fishing
- Hangout with Disney characters
- Decorate your house AND the village
- Craft items
- Sell items
- Explore the world
- Shop for seeds, ingredients, clothes and furniture
- Cook meal

...basically you'll never be bored while playing this game. It even synchronizes time of the day of your PC in-game. Weather changes, too. But it rains awfully alot in the game. The graphics are cute and colorful.

For the price of $20 this game is worthy of the cost. It's a survival-like. It's got elements of the sims to it and a creative mode feel to the world though you have to earn a lot on the way. As a survival game it falls flat, as a game with progression mechanics they are bare bones and almost unworthy of note. The characters are beautiful but have a few voice lines and all of their conversation is text which is a shame. All of the things it tries to be and provide end up a little lack luster and not quite there yet, some things are stunningly neglected. 

HOWEVER. This is a game in progress. That's expected to some degree and though the game needs a lot of work and love, and in my opinion a great deal of mechanics and visuals reworking on the gaming side (as opposed to the Disney and aesthetics side) it's a very fun game that will fill you with nostalgia and memories that will make you want to turn on a Disney movie. 

I'll be honest, if this WEREN'T a Disney game, if this game were new and in this state, I'd say wait and see where the game goes because it fails. However it IS a Disney game and they have a rich cast of characters with a history we know and love and so some of the ground they fail to establish and provide in the game is given a major bail out. 

So if you are looking for a great survival game in a rich world of gameplay. Wait. It's not there yet. If you want a great survival game filled with nostalgia and wonder buy it, particularly on sale because it's not there yet and I don't think this is a $30 game even with the Disney armor. $20 is a VERY fair price as of the time of this review and it's SHOULD only get better from here.

I would however, adjust some of the crafting systems to a more complex mechanics which will result in more joyful experience for discovering recipes and items. The crafting is fine, but feels dull sometimes. 

I'm still at the beginning, can't wait to see what Dreamlight valley has in store.",1671967690,1671967690,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is a nice life simulation game which allows you to move houses anywhere. Shape the valley according to your taste. Move your house to the land of dreams. Don't forget to share the screenshot!

Based on my observation, there should be at least 7 more realms to be released. Not guaranteed though.

Cons:
1. Real-time system -  You spend more time waiting once you reach certain quests and duties.
2. No festival activities / minigames - You have all of these fun characters in the game but you don't have any festival activities / minigames for these characters to play their role?
3. Random weather - By the time you need that rainy weather, you know you screwed up.
4. Creepy Donald Duck Line of Sight - This can be traumatic at the wrong timing with zoomed in view.

Advice:
The game has bunch of game breaking bugs you need to be caution of. Most of them can be fixed by reloading your save. One of the stuffs that can't be fixed would be quest items which spawned behind locked area of the biome. This is caused by spawn item limit and you can only deal with it by moving your wishing well there and teleport.

Feedbacks:
1. Scar has an issue where the interaction is locked until you progress further with the main storyline. Please don't lock the interaction behind story progression. Trying to complete seasonal hangout duty related to him is a pain. Especially when all of your seasonal duties is filled with long term duties.

2. Add more npc interactions. Breath MORE LIFE into the game. Make it fun to watch even if you're afking. Don't forget the seasonal interactions too.

3. Need weather forecast system badly so that people don't need to wait for the rain.

My evaluation of this game is that, it has potential worth of 60+ usd game (base only) if the developers implement festival / seasonal minigames involving the iconic characters, refining the npc interactions, rest of the vanilla realms, and also multiplayer realm for community activities.",1671966864,1671966912,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I really hope that with updates we get the ability to change the doors in our house, we have the beautiful doors available to us via Scrooges shop and as rewards yet they are only wall decorations which is a missed opportunity at the moment ^u^ Oh and on a similar note, being able to use other furniture as storage, so we dont have to clutter the room (or have a dedicated room) with chests !

It was gifted to me by a friend (not the company) and I streamed it as something I had to do to be polite and show gratitude. And... didn't like it. Streamed it one more time (by request) and somewhere that day I fell in love. 270 hours later I've not change my mind. <3

For an early access game it's brilliant. Filled with content and as yet I've not come across a single game-breaking glitch. The rare minor blips have been sorted (for me) by a restart of the game. The devs stay in touch with the community, work on fixing problems people may have, and new content is regular. 

The game is gorgeous. The music old favourites. 

There are many ways to play on any given day:
I can quest today... or not.
I can farm, or forage, or fish, or mine, or cook, or craft... or not.
I can decorate the many floors of my house, decorate the village (or create a new one!), or change the entire landscape on all the maps... or not.
I can play Fashions R Us and/or design my own clothing line... or not.
I can start a photo collection... or not.
I can Collect All The Things... or not.

Also this game makes me feel bad about my body. I hope changes are made.",1666798390,1671475922,False,14,6,0.573132932186126709,0,True,False,True
