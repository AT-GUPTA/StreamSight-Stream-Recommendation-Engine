Strangely Marvelous!

The very first Metal Gear was originally released on the MSX2 home computer in Japan on 13th of July 1987. But I knew and play it for the first time on PS1 with Metal Gear Solid back then on the 3rd of September 1998.

This one is the series finale. No more MGS which made me a bit sad. I've been following it from MGS I to MGS IV, also from all of the series on PSP like Portable Ops, Acid 1 & 2, Bande Dessinée and Peace Walker. With David Hayter as the VA of our beloved Snake.

But as usual, all good things must come to an end. Eventually.
(T^T)

MGSV (Ground Zero and The Phantom Pain) is excellent. Yeah, there are some weirdness in it; but that is what makes Kojima-san's games truly has unique signature in each of them.

And I am a dog person. So I absolutely love DD and always abundantly pet the mix breed (of a dog and a wolf?!) every single time I return to Mother Base. :3

Long story short. This finale is pure greatness! And never forget the true important subliminal message from all of this particular franchise that everyone living and breathing together around this planet must think of:

-------""If any of us has the power and rights to do justice on a huge scale, let's prevent any kind of wars. Especially nuclear war, starting now!""-------

Today, I had the idea: Let's try MGS5! it's on sale. Surely, this game must be really good, if it was good enough to trick people to like Kojima so much they actually recommended death stranding. 

Obviously, that was a complete lapse of judgement, and MGS5 decided to illustrate this point by throwing me in to the most deranged opening sequence I can recall for any video game, ever. It wasn't bad in the traditional sense of bad. But I was just sitting here, for 60+ minutes, thinking: holy ****, you lunatic, leave me alone already. I want to play the game. What the actual ****. 

It's like drowning in a pool of action movie tropes, but movie tropes usually have a point and now it's all pointless and we are just throwing in tropes for the sake of having more tropes. It's as if a 5 year old directed a movie by throwing in all the scenes he thought were cools in movies he never understood. And it keeps going. 

I ended up alt-contol-deleting the process because I couldn't get to the menu to quit the game properly and skipping cutscenes just sent me to the next cutscene. Thankfully I did it in time to refund the cutscene. I mean game.

This game is a great game. The game play is innovative, great cinematography, realistic feeling open world, and many more things. However, I do have some problems with this game. For starters, this game was created to fill plot holes, which isn't a bad thing, however, there are some plot holes in this story that are not explicitly told in the story. For example, in the epilogue/chapter 2 of the game, Eli and his group of child soldiers hijack Sahelanthropus, but, after the final mission in the game, we are not informed about what happened with Eli, and Sahelanthropus. (However there was a cut ending explaining what happened with Eli, and honestly it's not the fault of anyone really why it was cut). Other than this the game is really good, really friendly to newcomers, and is a game I highly recommend for both fans of the Metal Gear series, and People who aren't fans of this series, highly recommend especially for the price (which you can get on sale with Ground Zeroes and all the DlC for around $8).",1708122436,1708122467,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Revisited MGSV:TPP after some time, it aged so well. Still holding on to a dream of being able to play this masterpiece at its full potential... but that is never going to happen. The story KIND OF holds up, there are a lot of holes in the plot but Kojima the greatest creative mind in video game history somehow managed to make it make sense... I guess (story in audio logs and the usual insane amount of exposition during gameplay and cutscenes). The gameplay is perfect for this franchise, sadly this is the peak of MGS gameplay and here's hoping MGS3's reboot (I say reboot because of its different title compared to the original) will replicate the feeling of what we all felt with the original all those years ago :'(",1684158234,1707916912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MGSV has depth. Despite an unfinished story, the world building and scope of the game creates an atmosphere that is unmatched from others. There are flaws of course, but I feel like the entirety of the game makes up for its shortcomings. Kiefer Sutherland also does a fantastic job as a VA. It caught me off guard hearing Jack Bauer on the first mission. 

The controls are difficult at first but become easier as you progress. The progression can be slow sometimes and rather tedious depending on what your playstyle is. The missions are somewhat repetitive but offer a multitude of methods and strategies for completing them. 

Despite completing the game, I find myself coming back to explore, R&D at base, and attempt different challenges. It's great in 1-2 hour bursts where you don't have to feel committed to doing anything, it's just plain fun. 

Modding: There is a lot of mods online that enhance the experience. Infinite heaven for example offers a lot of customization and random missions that can be created. It really increases the replayability. Also... Quiet mods for the degenerates out there. 

Online: MGO is  dead, but I have created matches and been able to get full lobbies. Make one and people will join. Additionally, online has the potential to be fun with friends. Nothing beats the feeling of clowning your buddy with a fulton and hearing them scream.

Military Gore/Horror would have suited this game nicely,
 instead of the supernatural themes, but alas, this is a MGS game, 
and what I've come to learn is that all MGS games are a bit...""Quirky""?
This is the first metal gear solid I like, because the camera is at least 720 degrees more camera freedom. (It was about time too because other games like GTA 3 (PC) had free aim way before this) Note: although movement does have some glitches, especially when turning around in either a box or from prone.

PLUSES (+++) 's 
I like that you can recruit soldiers and manage them and their stats. + (note not direct management, more of a set stat that you can then manage the troop in diff areas of your base, somewhat)
I also like how you can create your own character to play online. +
I like how you can customise your sleeves emblem/badge to your liking. +
I like how the game rewards you for your dedication to the game and the more frequently you play. +
I also like being able to use futons to acquire troops, vehicles, turrets and even animals. +
It seems apparent that later down the line in the game you can play as other charaxcters too! +

//For the Devs [!]

All I can say against this game is that the controls takes some getting used to, being made for XBOX apparently from the in-game on-screen prompts such as A, B, X, Y format whereas I'm using a PlayStation controller, I have yet to find any way to change the prompts in options. 

APRIL 2022: Still playable with a PlayStation controller though just can get confusing, note.
Enjoyable game if you like Military Sim with added Supernatural Horror thrown in. At first I didn't like the supernatural stuff, but as the missions go on it sorta makes sense.
Unfortunately most of the best weapons are not unlocked early (meaning stealth based approaches) but using a bit of ""out-of-the-box"" approaches seems amusing.

After using my assault rifle on horseback, I found that aiming down the scope and controlling the horse, found that the horse was getting stuck trotting in circles, so thats a glitch. I ended up breaking out of it with left button (aim down sight) a few times and steering left and right.
Also since my last session with the game I forgot how to go fast while on horseback, While using a PlayStation controller? (Its ""click-in"" the LEFT joypad correct? as it were for running in person? well if thats the case it wasn't working for me at all, I could have pressed all the button to no avail.

OCT 2022:
I must say the controls are about as wacky as the creators humor, which is apparent ingame.
Who's idea was to make it more than 2 shoulder buttons to interact with zoom, gather intel and the like?,
What about the square button (Playstation) to initiate run on horseback yet its left analogue click to run not on horseback?

I guess it manage able but it just takes some getting used to which my hamper your initial liking of this game on the count on the buttons are just weird.

NOV 2022:

For a military sim game you'd think there would be a persistent compass available, not a binoc activated one. Makes it hard to quickly adapt to the changing environment and rush to a location.

Also the grenade trajectory is plain bad, I barely throw a grenade near a target because of the awkward camera angle when actviely chucking the nade. Not very intuitive. I want it to be easier to go from rifle to grenade, be able to simply throw one, more realistically and then go back to rifle or other weapon. It should be much easier so your not taken away fromt the immersion just to get stuck in menu crap.

Also firing a rifle or elsewise from horseback is bad too, if your down scope on rifle/sniper and press the movement left joystick a bit then the horse goes off and messes up your shot.

FEB 2024: I really want to play this game, I want to experience the story and all that. But it would take years and much money to keep my computer device up to handling the storage space issue.

That is one reason I cannot recommend this game, two, multiplayer I believe is deserted. But I ain't worrying about that too much the arenas are small, not that liberating. 

Some things are missing from this game, stuff youd expect a military sim slash horror game would have.

Like a persistent and always visible compass on the HUD. I have lost soo much time learning a settlement all because I didn't have a trusty compass (persistent remember, not binocs) or get lost in a firefight only to be attacked from all sides all because I was lcked in my map for too long trying to scope out the field.

Military sim is my favorite genre currently but MGS has always made me itch with discomfort. Whether it be camera angling issues or plain gameplay that is either repetitive or just buggy.

This kind of game is NOT what I expect a military game to be, I liked snake eater because it was almost an RPG as a military guy game. But where this game picks up from that to a miliary it fails to have character like the older games. And I'm not talking abut tricky gameplay functions (like the switch ocntroller on ps2 or whatevs) I hate that shit. This game is like go A to B then maybe capture C or pickup D

But thats not why I dislike this game, I don't like the inconsistent control scheme, I've tried Keybpard and mouse, I've tried PS4 controller, I also have an xbox controller but sometimes it doesn't work, but it doesn't matter, I shouldn't play this game with the unintuitive control scheme.

Lastly even though I believe it's around 30 to 40GB, I simply cannot afford to keep this game installed.",1647150768,1707473307,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As you near the end, it's painfully obvious Konami pushed the game out the door when it wasn't finished. The game abruptly ends with several essential plot threads unresolved. Even worse, the ending is the stupidest slap in the face in the history of video games.

The plot would have been terrible even if it was finished. Similar to George Lucas, series creator Hideo Kojima is one of those guys people hail as a genius or dismiss as a crackpot, and at times both sides are kind of right. With MGSV, the latter is overwhelmingly on display. The story is yet another unnecessary interquel that creates way more problems than it solves. Kojima clumsily touches numerous third rails in a failed effort to address humanitarian issues. Characters are mishandled. The story is tasteless and incoherent. Way too much of it is told via audio tapes, and protagonist Venom Snake speaks way too little. I guess Kiefer Sutherland's price was too high.

The gameplay and graphics are easily the game's strongest elements. This is the most sophisticated game engine ever seen in an MGS game, and the amount of gameplay content is orders of magnitude larger than any of the other games. This makes for a really fun sandbox to play around in, and there were plenty of great hours mixed in with the dud ones.

However, some of the biggest changes tend to water down the series' trademark stealth. If you get spotted, just automatically go into adrenaline time and pop the guy in the head before he has time to raise the alarm. If the alarm is raised, it's an open world, so just run offsite until things cool down. No need to hide the bodies of enemy troops or worry about tranqed enemies waking up; just attach a baloon to them, and watch the hilarious animation as your helicopter snatches them away. About to die? Just run around until your health automatically regenerates.

There's also the usual time-consuming bloat that comes with an open world game, not to mention a ton of garbage time managing the Mother Base, tinkering with your personnel, and researching weapons upgrades. It can't be overstated how many of my ""gameplay hours"" were spent sitting in a helicopter listening to audiotaped dialog, or AFK entirely, waiting for research upgrades to complete. And oh yeah, there are almost no bosses in a series famous for its amazing boss fights.

Ultimately, as awesome as MGSV's gameplay was at its best, 8 years later there are just too many great open-world sandboxes out there to recommend one with this many glaring flaws. If you want one that's story rich, try Witcher 3. If you want one that's stealth heavy, try Horizon: Zero Dawn. But if you want to see the ""Kojima style"" at its best, try Metal Gear Solid 3 and Zone of the Enders: 2nd Runner.",1707247247,1707247733,False,13,3,0.517704546451568604,0,True,False,False

after all these years? why are we still here guys?  just to suffer?

I know some of you've been searching for a game that can fulfill your hunger of a good content both online and offline.
Your searching is never over boss, but here is the game-- I guess the word  [i] ""Game"" [/i] isn't enough to explain about how great this masterpiece is, THIS GAME IS YOUR MOTHER BASE! Wherever you go, you will always come back here.

I played this game back in 2015 on PS3, and until this day, [b] NO GAME CAN GIVE ME THIS SATISFACTION [/b]
I even have my In Game name based on this game.

Story Review:
OH BOY! Hideo Kojima himself is a man where his body consist 70% movie reference, the story of this game here, is not your average or half-baked story just to exist in the game. You reading this review probably already play most of all MGS game, and I have nothing to tell you how sick is Hideo Kojima mind is.
100/10 !!

Gameplay Review:
I want to say this game is the peak of all MGS game, but NO! Every game in MGS game have their own uniqueness that you only can find it and experience it if you play them all. I really want to say this game is the best game ever I played, then I remember I also play MGS 3. 

Other than that, this game is big brain game, you can just go pew pew pew, unalive many enemies and have a hard time getting good people to develop your Mother Base.
Or
Be good, stealthy, don't kill anybody, make your enemies in awe by how sneaky you are, then you will always get elite and legendary recruit for your Mother Base.
9/10

Unfortunately this is one of the greatest examples of why not everything needs to be open world. There is not content anywhere. You repeat the same missions to progress the regular story. There is no fast travel and nothing happens in between the trip from point A to B. The worst thing about this game is you cannot manually save and you get one checkpoint per area. After spending an hour(55mins to be exact) in one area I failed mission and had to load all the way back a full in game day because the game does not save at any point once you're inside a zone. The checkpoints in this game is one of the worst decisions I've ever seen in any game ever.

MGO 3 (the multiplayer mode) is still up and running, and it has a good community behind it still. But the story mode is shrouded by a tangible 80s vibe, so if you like Old School, you'll enjoy this one here as well. 

My only complaint was that V doesn't have CO-OP in the way that Peace Walker did; the closest it has is on the FOB side of things, and unfortunately you're actively fighting/working against the other player instead of helping. If Free Roam had CO-OP, it'd be the next best thing since sliced bread).

The only other MGS game I've played is MGS2, and while that game is more narratively satisfying, MGSV has some of the tightest gameplay of any game I have ever played. And, seen as I got this game for the gameplay, I am incredibly satisfied. I haven't completely finished the game, but I've experienced a good chunk of it and have loved nearly everything about it.
My only gripe with MGSV, and this was also a gripe I had with MGS2, is that the boss fights SUCK. MGS is a stealth game series, and everything in the game is trying to make the player better at stealth. However, none of the boss fights challenge your ability to be stealthy. The fight against the Man on Fire, the Skulls ambush on pequod, and the fight with Sahalanthropus did not use the stealth skills whatsoever, which is a shame in my opinion, because a good boss fight should test the skills you have learned, not throw them away in favour of a gimmick(like the water towers in the case of MoF, or the melee with the skulls, or the tanks with Sahalanthropus). Other action games like DOOM, Dark Souls, etc. all feature bosses that are fun to fight because the bosses challenge the skills that the game has the player learn. One boss fight that was really good, however, was the boss fight against Quiet and then the later fight against the Skull snipers. Those two missions were great, largely because they utilize the skills the game teaches the player, which are to act quickly, shoot accurately, and stay out of sight. Thankfully, most boss fights are very short, and the good ones(the sniper ones) are the only ones that take a good amount of time.

After finishing the story(spoilers): The story, overall, is okay. I know that it was unfinished due to the aforementioned development hell Kojima Productions was put through. For what is there, most of it feels like filler content, and it really only serves to demonstrate to the player how Outer Heaven as we know it in the earlier MGS games came to be, as well as clearly establish the identity of MG1's ""Big Boss"". Finishing the story also grants the player access to Grey Fox's Cyborg Ninja suit, which is convenient, as the increased movement speed allows the player to more easily achieve S Rank on missions, which then allows the player to access Raiden's MGRR suit. If you're going to play this game for its story, I'd pass unless you are hardcore into Metal Gear Solid for the story and lore.",1705822615,1706757239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For those who seek a unique and fun experience, I strongly suggest to you, that you purchase this game. Although it has its years now, I believe that this game is still better than many games out there (Pretty surprising!). MGSV is relatively short when it comes to the story mode; HOWEVER, it is a very well-done story. You have plenty of content to busy yourself with such as FOBs (Forward Operating Base, in other words, a secondary base that a player has), Side Op missions, free-roam, and multiplayer (the chances of finding an active lobby are the same chances of those for a Jackpot).

The in-game mechanics are thought through perfectly, and every bit of this game has been developed to near perfection. The AI is extremely well done, the dialogues between characters are entertaining, and the wide variety of arsenal keeps you switching weapons on the battlefield.

I don't want to spoil anything else for those who have not immersed themselves in this experience yet. If you do decide to give this game a go, please, make sure to enjoy it as much as possible 😀 !

Kind Regard!

But after finishing it there's no doubt in my mind that I will eventually play them all. With just playing Ground Zeroes (i also listened to all the tapes) I immedeately became invested in the world of Metal Gear. There was so many names, so many mysteries, so many past events, all of that being thrown at me right from the fucking beginning and I just loved every single minute of it.

The Story is in my mind perfect. There's so much to think about. So much to reveal and uncover. I just wanted to know and understand everything. The characters are fun, written cleverly and make the more depressing and dark tone of the game feel more alive. And yet, I still think there's a lot of stuff I missed and misunderstood. Because the narrative is just so complex and compelling, yet I just can't express how much I love it. I literally listened to every single tape in the game lmao. Oh, and the plot-twist at the end, FUCK! So good.

But where I think the game truly shines is in the gameplay. Why? Because it gives the player almost complete freedom. You can do 90% of the game the way you like and want to and it will let you. Altough, I was pissed when I couldn't kill the kids :(. So many weapons to use. So many ways to kill. So many ways to do shit. Stealth, diversion, destruction,... There just aren't many games that will give you all that.

The rest is just the cherry on top. Cinematic cutscenes. Engaging atmosphere. Awesome music. AAAAAND - Quiet. My new wife btw. Hideo Kojima is just a fucking GOD! 10/10 Best game fr",1706291485,1706291485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Where do I even start… This is my absolute favorite game of all time, and when I first played it on PS4 back in late 2021, I realized how much I missed out on. I'm convinced that if Witcher 3 didn't release when it did, this game would've received GOTY instead. No other game has allowed me so much freedom in missions and so much customization. The managing of your own private military company is so deep but still so much fun, to the point that it makes me sad that I picked up this game so late, because at this point multiplayer is probably pretty dead.

For a Metal Gear game though, the story isn't all that great. Don't get me wrong, it's awesome on its own and I’d give it a 7/10 or 8/10, but it's not the best story in the series; that would probably go to Metal Gear Solid 1 or 3. It has to be my biggest gripe with the game though. At the time of writing this it's probably not news to you, but the mistreatment of Kojima by Konami seriously affected this game's development to the point where the story is blatantly unfinished, and with a game this strong, it always makes me think what could have been.

The critical acclaim is well-deserved, and I gotta thank the modding community for keeping this game alive on PC at least, together with the rest of the franchise. This game will always hold a special place in my heart for cementing my love for the Metal Gear series (after Twin Snakes introduced me to it). After all, no other game has allowed me to kill guards with a rocket arm while telling my dog to slit another guy’s throat, or calling a supply drop on some dude’s head, or attaching an anime girl to my cardboard box to distract someone, or making my horse shit on command to cause vehicles to slip, or best of all, make my helicopter blast Take on Me while it shreds up my enemies with machine gun fire

(you can do this all vanilla btw, and I’ve only mentioned the tip of the iceberg of what you can do)

Also I’d smash Quiet

The gameplay is masterfully designed, with such a level of depth and variety that if you can think of a ridiculous strategy, its likely possible. For example, attaching a fulton balloon to a crate you're standing on to float over high walls, hiding in a toilet and playing an audio tape of a guard shitting to stop your location being investigated, planting explosives and traps all over a base and watching the symphony of destruction unfold, using a smoke grenade on a bunch of soldiers only to combo takedown them as if you were Batman or rigging a car with C4 as you roll it towards the enemy. Its all so well done, and the powerful skills and varied arsenal of Big Boss creates the feeling of being a one-man-army while retaining the tension of a survival stealth game. 
The graphics are stunning, near photo-realistic, and my sub-par PC can run it at almost maximum settings without a single frame drop, which I have never seen in any other game. Perhaps its the mysterious Kojima magic infused in the Fox Engine. 
The story isn't too overbearing, one could even call it sparse, but when it hits, it hits, and some of the missions are just phenomenal. Its a shame there's such a trace of cut content in this game, as there are a lot of plotlines set up without follow up, but with how rocky the development was (because Konami suck) it turned out incredible nonetheless. 
Only thing I can criticise are the recycled missions, while some can be a decently fun challenge (like the subsistence missions for the Snake Eater nostalgia) most of them are just really frustrating, and definitely going a little hard on the challenge-to-fun ratio, and they do not feel super rewarding. But they are completely optional.

This game is absolutely incredible nonetheless, cannot recommend enough. Bravo Kojima.",1706121619,1706121619,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, after putting it away for a few years, and deciding to appreciate it on its own merits, rather than as the non-existent game in my head I would like to see instead, I did end up immensely enjoying finishing up the story.

One thing I will say is that the second half is a lot stronger than the first, which is rare for a video game. (To clarify, I'm talking about the second half of the story, not ""Chapter 2"" specifically.) I also find that knowing some of the major spoilers in advance can actually greatly enhance the enjoyment of the experience and make it less jarring or off-putting. (Don't worry, I won't post any spoilers here.)
I would also like to dispel the rumor that this game is unfinished. While some content was cut, as with any game, and while Kojima's ambition knows no bounds, this game and its story is definitely completed in its current state. Especially if you compare the total volume of cutscenes, audio tapes, and gameplay environments to the total volume of cutscenes, codec calls, and gameplay environments in any one of the other MGS games, it checks out.

For those who like to mess around with games or even be completionists, the gameplay speaks for itself. But I would like to address those who like me might feel like they struggle (or would struggle) with some of the sillier or less immersive-looking aspects of the game. So here are some pointers I have found for myself:

- Only fulton enemies with a high rank. If you fulton everyone, it can get repetitive and a little cheap. But fultoning select enemies is actually kind of fun.

- Ignore the ""demon points"" feature. While the game doesn't talk about it, most people I think know about it: Kill too many enemies and eventually your ""horn"" will grow and you'll be permanently bloody. But this is unlikely to happen unless you mow down every single enemy and make some obviously morally questionable decisions later on that I won't spoil. Trying to tranquilize every guard severely hindered my enjoyment. So with this relative leeway in mind, I suggest throwing a suppressor on a .45 and making use of your knife whenever necessary like in the other games.

- Every couple of missions, go into the staff management, look for staff with the troublemaker attribute, fire them, then select to automatically sort all staff into what roles fit them best. Next, go to combat deployment (will be unlocked relatively early on) and keep sending the teams on missions that give a good amount of GMP and resources like fuel, metals, and ""biological materials."" Lastly, develop your base platforms whenever you can. Doing these few things will ensure that you can pretty much unlock/develop all the weapons and items you want, and that you'll unlock all the important sideops that can become available toward the end of the game.

- This point will be controversial, but I find locking the framerate to 30 makes me play more slowly and methodically, like a real stealth game. 60 fps really encourages me to run around and just kind of play like a headless chicken. And yes, it's a meme, but 30 fps does look more cinematic, and where has that ever been more appropriate than in an MGS game? But this is up to personal taste, obviously. I felt ""forced"" to play it at 60 for the longest time but switching to 30 increased my enjoyment immensely.

- Don't do ""free roam."" Seriously. The best tip I can give is that when out in the mission area, you can open the menu (*not* the iDroid, the game menu) and there will be an option called ""Return to ACC."" I use this as often as I can. Doing random side missions and just traversing around the map in general really burned me out on the gameplay and overall atmosphere, and made the story feel ""thinner"" than it needed to. Just do main missions and a few sideops with relevant rewards or progression. Don't free roam and capture random outposts, you're going to revisit them enough as it is. Unless you don't mind all that, of course. For me, it helped to cut out as much downtime as possible.

- LISTEN TO AUDIO TAPES AS SOON AS YOU GET THEM! The audio tapes should be seen as the new codec calls/""power point"" cutscenes. The yellow ones are the crucial ones, but all of them are what constitutes the story and are obligatory in my opinion. I made the mistake of treating them as kind of side content and, honestly, not fully appreciating them. The fact that they're optional certainly didn't help. So, basically treat them as if they were not optional. Then you will also find that this game actually has an amazing story and some of the most original and well-thought out ideas in any MGS game, far from having a ""bad"" story.

- There are guides online about making some graphics tweaks which really help the game, mainly activating HBAO+ in your nvidia control panel and turning off the ingame AO. Depending on your graphics card, locking it at 30 fps can also free up power to bump up the resolution, which helps with aliasing. The latter is a night-and-day difference for me visually.

Good luck and have fun! As a long time MGS fan, it helps not to treat this game as the big series finale. That's MGS4. And it's objectively also not the most ""MGS""-MGS game, that's MGS3 in my opinion. It serves as a great sort of ""interquel,"" sandwiched between Peace Walker and Metal Gear 1. All in all I'm really glad I gave this game another chance. Yes, it's very different, by design, but it's still a wonderful game in its own right and a worthy addition to the Metal Gear series.",1705263024,1705263024,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1609900036,1705068915,True,0,0,0.437507688999176025,0,True,False,False

Stealth with no weapons can be just as fun as rolling up to a base in a tank, because the game just drops you in and let's you decide how you'll play with all the tools your given, never leaving a dull moment behind and exploration for many hours.

We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
And all the millions here
We must have died alone

The Phantom Pain is an absolute overall masterpiece. The only downside is how the story does not have a proper ending while having so much build-up, it's quite sad what happened with the director and that we might never get any MGS with his vision behind it going forward. 

The Gameplay:
The gameplay and mechanics are some of the most perfected that any game has ever focused on. The character movement is very smooth, which is up there with games like Control and even Watchdogs where you can play around with the left stick and there are different in-between animations for your character in comparison to games like The Witcher where the character's movement is stiff when changing direction. Not to mention there are different stances which all have great movement although I find that moving backward while in a prone position can somehow cause forward movement. 
There are mechanics such as day/night which you can choose when to infiltrate enemy bases during a mission and tools to help you do so depending on what you choose. The Enemy AI is also on the clever side in that they can start wearing helmets when they find they are mostly killed by headshots and will also equip night vision goggles when you mostly infiltrate at night. You are equipped with options to choose certain partners which can be a dog, Quiet the sniper, and a walking gun machine. Then other items are choosing the form of transportation such as vehicles or a horse for traveling the open world, although it's not quite as open but each deployment gives you freedom of how to approach the enemies.  

The Story:
I'd be lying if I said that I understood the story of the game, but I sure enjoyed some twists as this was my first time playing a Hideo Kojima game, I just wish I could have an ending to it in order to have a more clearer understanding of the whole thing.

The Controls:
The controls of this game are great and modern, I know there was only one button which was a problem for me and made no sense, especially on horseback( I shall come back to this when I remember exactly what it was). But with a game that gives as many tools which all have their own control schemes, it is something that is bound to happen. 

The Sound:
The sound of this game really encompasses you in the world, and the fact that it changes depending on if you're using binoculars is also a great detail. The only issue is how I found the sound too hard when running or have your horse galloping it is a bit off for me, I would not be surprised if that was intentional as I believe it could've been to enhance the experience to show the sound distortion when running almost like what they did with the crosshairs when shooting becoming double as a way to give an experience of a character that is blind on one eye. 

I made the mistake of playing Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain before playing Ground Zeroes( as I thought it was some sort of an online multiplayer thing) which is another thing that made the story confusing for me but I found the experience of this game way too perfect that it could stand with the most modern titles and even best them when it comes to the mechanics and even the graphics although it does not have RTX. This is one of the greatest gaming experiences in history in my opinion, you could even say Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the only ones that worked hard to dethrone it.",1704741019,1704741019,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I started off not liking this game. It felt like random stages that did not mean anything. The game play was good, but I was expecting an epic story like other MG games and it had almost no story. I was not sure if I wanted to keep playing. I kept playing and learned how to play the tapes while on mission. This got me more interested in the story although there werent many cut scenes. As the game progresses more than half way you actually get more cut scenes and I eventually got invested with the game. The story is fine, nothing great, but not horrible. The problem is that MG games are known for story. I enjoyed playing, but found myself ready for it to be over before it was. Decent game play, but not enough to keep me wanting more. The game looks like its over after part 1, but it really has more to the story, it is easy to see they ran out of time and money and so they fill time with repeat missions. You dont have to do the repeat missions and there are 7 more missions that add a lot to the story, which everything added to the story at this point is really interesting because enough background has been laid down. Mission 43 was emotional. Mission 46 was a bombshell for the story, but it is 95% repeat of a previous encounter. They could have made this bombshell so much better without repeating content. Mission 45 was awesome as well. After each of these mission there are credits that roll that arent easily skipped and so it seems like the end of the game. A weird way to play out the game. Pacing is this games biggest downfall, if the pacing was better it could be shorter and more story driven. You also have to really dig into details to understand the story and with a drawn out game with repeats and filler its easy to lose track of whats going on over 50 hrs.

Graphics were good for the time. Played awesome on steam deck. Actually enjoyed it more on SD then PC because easier to pick up and play. It was a pretty long game for something that was ""cut short"". It is actually 2 to 3 times longer than other MGS games. Maybe they could have cut some things to make it a tighter experience. I enjoyed it, it is a well built game, well optimized, but not amazing.",1704335621,1704727455,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is probably one of the most interesting games I have ever reviewed, there are so many elements that work but manage to fall short. It's no secret that Kojima and Konami have had major clashes and battles over creative and practical liberties in the past, and MGS 5 shows those scars. You can really see where Konami's interference, but also Kojima's over eccentric ideas, have created a project that was too ambitious for its own good

[h3]Engine, Gameplay & Level Design[/h3]
We'll first start with the gameplay and engine, I'm happy to report that both of these are top notch. The Fox Engine has been herald as an underrated game engine with large capabilities and potential, and here it shows. FE allows for a large open world format of stealth gameplay, there are multiple ways to approach the enemy from virtually any angle allowing for greater freedom of play. There are tons of weapons that can be made and used for different purposes and play-styles. The AI is the most intelligent in the series with improved sight detection from enemies and very responsive combat buddies (like Quite or D-dog), if anything it might be too good as the tanks without fail manage to always hit with laser accuracy. The approach to day/night cycles along with environmental cycles impacts both your's and enemy visibility or stealth methods. it is a little annoying to change camouflage or suppressors for weapons and you can only carry 3 weapons at a time (not including the bionic arm) to change and any of these you need to deploy a supply drop which can take a little while. All and all the Fox Engine is fantastic and serves its stealth gameplay mechanics incredibly well.

[h3]Story[/h3]
MGS 5 takes place 9 years after the events of Ground Zeroes, and from the ashes of the MSF came to form the PMC group the Diamond Dogs. With the united goal of reclaiming what was taken from them, to stop the pain from what they have lost. The game's main overarching theme revolves around the idea of phantoms, something that seems real but isn't, and manages to indulge this theme very well as Big Boss and Kaz have lost everything both figuratively (loosing the MSF) and literally (loosing their limbs) still clinging on to the illusion that things are the way they seem but struggle to maintain that illusion. The story is split into 2 chapters which explore other intermingling themes of [b]Revenge[/b] and [b]Race[/b]. 

The 1st chapter is, for most part, pretty good. It keeps itself focused and is consistent with the overarching theme of phantoms with interesting setups and foreshadowing for later events, the pacing can be a little bit inconsistent but nothing too egregious or abrupt. Skull Face is an interesting main antagonist that'll get more into later along with the Third Child and Burning Man.

Meanwhile, the 2nd chapter is rushed and half baked, it has a few interesting moments ([spoiler]like the Shining lights, even in death scene[/spoiler]) but there are character arcs and plot points that are objectively unfinished and the sheer audacity to have the majority of the 2nd chapter be mostly repeat missions is so lazy to pad out its campaign length it's baffling, it's literally some of the least interesting levels in the game with 3 different modes. Subsistence (weapons procured on site), Extreme (instant death) and Total Stealth (don't get caught). I understand. And on top of all of that the theme of Race is explored as well as it should be. I understand the complications that went into making MGS 5, and even knew that it was an incomplete story going in, but surely there had to have been better ways to approach this flaw (get a writer to shit out an extraction mission or two).

One problem that I have with the way the story is presented, is that because of the open world formatting this means the story is more loose and sparse. More often than not you have to complete at least one mission or about 3-5 side ops missions in order to progress the story which can cause some pacing issues, more so in chapter 2.

Alot of the gaps presented in the story of MGS 5 are relayed through cassette tapes, and there is a lot of cassette tapes. they're a great idea as invokes the feeling that there is more going on at Motherbase while your gone. But personally I don't really have the patience to sit through 200+ tapes to get a more accurate picture. 

[h3]Characters[/h3]
[b]Quiet[/b] - I can see what they were going for with Quiet but isn't explored as well as it could've been, trying to give her a heavy burden but poor pacing hinders it and also the reason for Quiet's revealing clothing is really stupid (should've been more like Eva from MGS 3).

[b]Skull Face[/b] - One of the most interesting characters, not just in the game but the whole franchise along with his motives for revenge, kinda wished they'd explore his character a little more.

[b]Eli[/b] - Out of all the characters his arc is the most incomplete and least explored ([spoiler]which is  disappointing considering he is supposed to be liquid and is tied to the Third Child[/spoiler]). 

[b]Huey Emmerich[/b] - If you didn't like Huey from what you heard about him in MGS 2, then your gonna hate him even more here. Fuck Huey, all my homies hate Huey.

[h3]The World[/h3]
The world is large but very barren, some guard posts/bases here and there with some goats & donkeys sprinkled in, that's it really. There's no NPCs to talk to or bases to permanently capture, It's like RDR but with no life to it. The way its designed to approach bases stealthily can be pretty creative.

[h3]The Plot Twist (spoilers)[/h3]
[spoiler] the story ends after mission 45, but if you complete all the important side ops missions you get a secret 46th mission. At the start of the game, you had to customise a character and provide him with a name, at mission 46 it's revealed the entire time you weren't Big Boss, but instead you were the combat medic in Ground Zeroes that you customised at the start. Despite mission 46 essentially being a repeat mission it does allow you notice certain things that you missed in the introduction and the plot twist was foreshadowed fairly subtly. The purpose of this twist is not just because your playing as phantom of the boss (and thus furthering the themes of phantoms) but also to highlight that the Boss's ideals are apart of you and carry on with you the audience, you are Big Boss, okay it's a tiny bit pretentious but it doesn't go full fart sniffer. The only issues I have with this twist is it does leave a few questions like when did Ocelot hypnotise him into thinking that he's Big Boss (it's just mentioned off screen despite the medic being in a coma for 9 years), how come he sounds exactly like Big Boss vocal cord are physical not psychological. but it's only minor, in fact it's probably the only to tell the story of phantoms and revenge without creating bigger plot holes and retcons for the series.[/spoiler]

There is a lot more I want to say, but to summarise. Overall I'd recommend it for the stealth gameplay and first chapter alone, but still 75% of the game is great, and 25% is empty and at times annoying

[b]Ratings[/b]

+ Great stealth gameplay
+ Fox Engine is amazing
+ Awesome cinematic cutscenes
+ Great ideas and concepts explored
+ Plot twist is intriguing (even if it does raise a couple of questions)
+/- Characters are interesting (though underdeveloped)
+/- Open world is like RDR but with no life to it
+/- Acting is great but odd when compared to rest the series
+/- Cassette tapes fill in gaps in story, but there's so many
- Unfinished story (with inconclusive character arcs & story elements)
- Tedious & unnecessary repeat missions (particularly in chapter 2)
- Missing weirdness and charm from the previous titles (feels different from the rest of the series)

[h1] But what about the multiplayer? [/h1]

You start out with the character you made in the prologue, a pretty neat creative developer choice. But a not so neat developer choice was to completely abandon the multiplayer in less than 2 years of it's release, not even a simple note from the developers or no declaration from them that they're just going to leave everything without a word. Even the developers saying ""Fuck you"" straight to our face would be more nice then what they did. It's also important to mention that the game is an unfinished product thanks to Konami fucking over Kojima, the man behind the entire franchise who started it all, it's really saddening that he didn't even get to finish the story of Metal Gear. Enough complaining about the current state of the franchise, let's talk about the positive sides of the multiplayer.

[h2] Every imaginable good aspect of multiplayer: [/h2]

Well made class system and enjoyable combat.
Possible to have a stealthy approach in a multiplayer game.
[spoiler] Fun if you find a lobby. [/spoiler]

[h2] Negative sides: [/h2]

Finding a lobby is pain.
The only way to get GP aka in game currency is to play auto matches, do an ascension or of course buy it, it was possible early in the release days to get GP from custom matches too but of course not it's not possible anymore.
Absolute lack of support.
P2P connection. [spoiler] Basically after you or your enemy kills you in a fire exchange theres a high chance that the other one who won will shortly die after the first one dies because of the lag that P2P connection has. [/spoiler]
Useless DLC's.

As my first Metal Gear game I went into it blindly, and came out quite impressed. Despite its repetitive missions and activities in the open world, rather weak writing for the antagonist and some of the supporting casts, lots and lots of exposition over radio and not as animated or interactive as you might have expected from a AAA game, and the abrupt and unsatisfying ending, it somehow still manages to always remain fun and interesting. When most other games have the above mentioned problems the game end up being mediocre at best. But in Phantom Pain the gameplay, the amazing visuals which is still better than most new games, and the music makes for such a grounded experience that I know it will stick in my mind for years.

Getting all the achievements is also fun, albeit impossible without a guide for some of the collectibles. Another top tier game for the golden year of gaming in 2015!",1704486621,1704486621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite a rushed development cycle which hampered its conclusion, it still manages to impress—in gameplay, visuals & performance—and delivers the pinnacle in stealth gameplay

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
The game is an open-world experience—the first for the franchise, and delivers excellently on this front. You play the game primarily from Mother Base and from your ACC—Aerial Command Center. You'll take on all of your primary missions, SIDE OPS and various other content from your iDroid, which you can access at any time during gameplay. Selecting the content you wish to do will prompt you with a choice of ""LZ"" to land at and begin your mission. From here, you can complete your task at hand—such as with your primary missions—or wander about freely in the open world, completing SIDE OPS as you see fit. It's also entirely possible to roam the world freely at any time without any tasks present.

As you play through the game, you'll earn resources which will allow you to upgrade your Mother Base, as well as your equipment, and equipment of your Buddies that you can take with you into missions and into the open world. This system is the primary progression for your gear, which will see you researching bigger and better weaponry—both lethal & non-lethal—and making Big Boss the best he can be for the job

Scattered around the game world are Guard Posts and Outposts, which you can capture for a one-time unlock, and again repeatedly for in-game currency & resources. However, unlike other open-world games, there is no ""fog of war"" mechanic at play here, meaning the entire map is always visible to you.

In terms of the actual stealth gameplay, it's overwhelmingly satisfying once you get the hang of it. You can go in guns blazing as well of course, but achieving a Perfect Stealth + No Kills run is one of the most cathardic experiences one can have in gaming, if they like the genre. There are various boss battles throughout the game as well, which can be both fun and frustrating.

[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
The game takes place after the events of [i][b]METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES [/b][/i]and follows Big Boss through the rebuilding process of Mother Base, as he contends with Skull Face, the game's main villain. In true [i][b]METAL GEAR[/b][/i] fashion, the story is full of twists and turns and can at times be hard to follow. But for the sake of keeping it a fresh experience for as many people as possible, I will say that its conclusion is absolutely phenomenal for anyone who is into the franchise.

[h1][b]Performance[/b][/h1]
Fox Engine was incredible. As with its predecessor, the game is gorgeous, runs perfectly (zero stutters, hitches or frame drops in over 130 hours) and still holds up in 2023. It's limited to 60 FPS (which can be bypassed to mixed results) but I quickly got used to this and had a fantastic time. There's also a major modding scene if you wish to take the game and its engine even further.

[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]
[i][b]METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN[/b][/i] is one of the best games I've ever played. It tells an amazing story, it looks fantastic, it runs amazingly, and it plays like an absolute dream. This truly is the pinnacle of stealth gameplay. If you're even curious about this game, buy the [i][b]METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE DEFINITIVE EXPERIENCE[/b][/i] for the best stealth gameplay & story you've ever experienced.",1694342133,1704481500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

go in guns blazing, use tank, IFV, artilery, robots or helicopter. Variety of aproach to mission objective is vast. MGS V offers a diverse array of guns and equipment. The depth of customization of various equipment and support options contribute to the game's replayability and tactical depth.

The level of details in MGS V is astonishing. Enemies comunicate over radio with their supperiors, they will investigate and report suspicious behavieous to their CP, tend to wounded comrades, adapt to weather conditions and players tactics and strategies. Kojima charm is present through game in things like The ""Man on Fire"" on his flaming horse, robots and elite super solider ninja units. Game features extensive list of main missions,side missions and collectibles scattered across wide expanse of terrains.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Bringing You Delicious Canned Meat Since 1937: The History of the SPAM Brand

Jay C. Hormel, son of George Hormel, had an inventive mind. He’d been working on a consumer-branded canned ham since 1926. After a decade the cooking and packaging technology aligned. And during a 1937 New Years Eve party, the name SPAM was coined and the brand was born.

Launched as 'The Meat of Many Uses,' SPAM products was quickly adopted by American housewives. By 1940 70% of urban Americans were eating SPAM products. But it was the arrival of WWII, and the need for easily- transported protein, that fueled the SPAM brand’s incredible growth. By 1959 over one billion cans had been sold.
Product Description

Treat your taste buds to a fiesta of flavor with SPAM Jalapeño. It pairs the delicious SPAM Classic with the zesty spice of jalapeño peppers. There’s a reason that 12.8 cans of SPAM products are eaten every second. You can enjoy this fully cooked spiced meat hot or cold, making it perfect for home cooked meals, family get-togethers, or even camping food. Get creative with the SPAM brand and experience the flavor today! SIZZLE PORK AND MMM. SPAM is a trademark of Hormel Foods, LLC.

Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023
Flavor Name: Hickory SmokeSize: 12 Ounce (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
You can't buy these in grocery stores and if you could, they'd cost 2x as much. I'd never tried this flavor before and my husband and I got the can open the night it was delivered. Just like the other flavors we've tried, this is subtle. I love that. It's not over powering but has it's own taste. I was assuming I'd not like it because I don't care for smoked foods but this doesn't taste smoked at all. I'd absolutely buy it again

I'm not sure if I genuinely enjoyed MGSV or if I just forced myself to play through it because I like the other MGS games so much.

If i were to describe this game in one word I would call it ""a chore"".

MGSV has too much padding, its simply too big for how little story there is, its an amazing game gameplay wise but that gameplay can quickly become repetitive when it takes so long to get through everything.

You're forced to do mission after mission without cutscenes to finally reach one short story beat, and most of the story is told through audio logs that are annoyingly tucked away in a menu, and you just have to either sit and listen to them or painfully speed them up step by step, but they never hit as hard as those codec calls from earlier games did, especially if you ignore them for a long time due to all the filler ones and then the story critical ones pile up and become another chore.


This game can be very special, its peaks are very high but its valleys are also very low, and i think in the end it simply took too much of my time.",1620424741,1703541276,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But honestly idk if this game deserves a 9/10. Don't get me wrong, it's good, it's even REALLY good at some points, but I just get bored with it after a certain amount of time. 

The good:
So many different systems in place that all work more or less flawlessly. Almost every button press has 2 functions with tap/hold functionality on a keyboard, which I've yet to see in anything other than MGS games, and it makes the game so much more immersive. The amount of ways you can approach any given situation is absolutely wild, whatever your mind can think up of, you can probably do. Go in guns a-blazing, or stealth your way in without taking anyone out, or have your dog do the distracting for you, or call in a helicopter on the base and watch it tear everything apart, and etc. 

The cinematics are well done and entertaining, albeit a bit awkward, which is what MGS has always been so no surprise there. There's lots of upgrades to get, and lots of content to go through. 

The bad:
Even though all of the details are really well made with lots of effort and polish put into them, it all feels... idk, like wasted potential? The maps are very large, but for the most part there's not a whole lot to really do in them, and a lot of areas are covered off with invisible walls so it becomes a pretty restrictive open world. The whole gameplay loop is basically take a helicopter to a drop off zone>sneak or fight into a base>do objectives>sneak or fight back out>take helicopter back to your base. While you can spice it up with the amount of ways you can approach any problem, I don't really care to think up of imaginative ways to approach the game. I would've much rather had a linear model where I'm forced to use different tactics on different parts of the game, rather than just have the option to do it however I want at all times. 

The other part I'm not a fan of is how researching things works, it starts off innocent enough, until you start to see 3 day long research times for new equipment. And that counts only in-game hours too, not any time spent outside of the game. So something that you would find blueprints for in older titles and have available for your next mission, you now have to wait for 72 hours of in-game time. 

In summary, this is greatly executed game with lots of polish, but the underlying gameplay loops are pretty meh. I'd give it closer to a 6 or 7 out of 10 rather than the 9/10 it sits at, so that's why the review is negative.",1703288584,1703288584,False,4,0,0.470095396041870117,0,True,False,False

In the vast and intricate world of espionage and military intrigue, the game's character roster feels surprisingly monochromatic. The absence of diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and genders among the main characters is a missed opportunity for a series known for its complex storytelling. The diverse gaming community deserves a more inclusive representation in a narrative that spans the globe.

While the gameplay mechanics remain top-notch and the open-world design is impressive, the lack of diversity in the character lineup is impossible to ignore. In an era where the industry is acknowledging the importance of diverse narratives, The Phantom Pain feels like a step backward.

The narrative could have been significantly enriched by incorporating a broader range of perspectives, making the game more relatable to a diverse audience. As players, we yearn for stories that reflect the diversity of our experiences, and The Phantom Pain falls short in delivering that connection.

I hope that future entries in the Metal Gear Solid series will take a more progressive approach, recognizing the value of diversity and inclusion in creating a more immersive and engaging gaming experience.

That being said, let me tell you about one of my favourite konami games. My second favourite silent hill game and a game I've finished so many times, I can't even count anymore.

Since you're lazy, youtube watching, god believing filth. I'm gonna assume you've never played this game before and you're never going to because you assume it sucks. I'm even gonna assume you've seen the Internet Historian video of it or something. Better yet, I'll assume you're a big tall black woman with hips that could crush a melon.

One thing we don't have to assume is that the game has aged pretty well, despite sporting PS2 level graphics and a made for Wii control scheme, the game translates very well to every device. Altough you're seeing me play the PC version, which totally exists, trust me. I used to play this game on PSP all the time as a teenager. The version with tank controls, that is...
But why replay a game like this? I thought this was hot garbage?! I hear you say. And you're wrong, this game is amazing and you will sit down and listen, you impetuous child. It goes like this: You're seemingly coming back from your day at the fair with your daughter, when suddenly the entire seasons change, it's winter now, so you slip on ice and end up crashing in a silent hill junkyard.

There's also a therapy session going on between you and your therapist, obviously. He makes you fill a short form which will allow him to get a general bearing on your personality. This will shape not only how Harry Mason (that's you by the way) how he interacts with people, but it also changes who you'll meet, what their attitude towards you is, how they're dressed. Tons of big and small differences emerge from playtrough to playtrough.

So you wake up in the snow, the car is a mess and your daughter is nowhere to be seen. By pressing the interact key, you can shout her name in the vain hope of finding her back. You make your way trough a gas station's garage and quickly end up with your first big decision. Do you search for her in the electronic's store or the dress shop. You can't explore both and it's quite unclear how it affects the narrative.

Because every decision in SHattered Memories ends up being somewhat of a moral decision. All of it is fed into what the game more or less calls a psychoanalysis program. And what you look at, how you respond to the therapy sessions and which doors you go trough, all gets used to forge a different experience from beginning to end. It's really unique and I love it. Every time I try to give an honest but different answer and every time I get a subtly different experience. 

Regardless, you go trough one of the two stores and you end up with two possibilities. Either the diner is closed and you'll end up having a chat with a friendly bartender. Or diner is open, at which point you'll end up talking to cybil bennet, a returning character from Silent Hill 1. In fact, this whole game is intended as a remake of the original silent hill, but it's really more of a complete reimagining of the entire franchise. It doesn't care about cults or any of that silly god nonesense. It's actually not a supernatural story, believe it or not.

Now, I won't describe the whole game, because that would take hours and it wouldn't accomplish the goal of this review which is to convince people to play it. Because, Shattered Memories is such a heavy hitter of narrative prowess and the acting is really well directed. There is some iffy acting at times, it's no Death Stranding. But its nothing to compare with some of the disasterous acting of the japanese games. I mean, I love Silent Hill 2 with all my heart but, some of these scenes feel like they lack proper direction. They just sound so weird. It is part of that game's charm. But, you know?
Shattered Memories' acting and writing won't leave you giggling. Everyone does a top notch job adapting to all these different possible tones and scenarios. And the symbolism is strong. What I like most about Shattered Memories is the music. It is perhaps my favourite soundtrack in the franchise. They range from straight up beautiful songs, to a lot of screeching and yelling which work's really well in context all the way to a literal Elvis Presley cover.

One of the songs, Hell Frozen Rain, is absolutely burned in my mind. Let me type it out from memory.

In your mind's eye
Lives a memory
Hard to find
Blinded by sorrow
and a cold voice
sings a melody
hear her sing
Hell Frozen Rain falls down
DOO DOO DOODOO DO DO

So yeah, as you can tell I'm a big fan of this game. I love to see games being used as a medium for storytelling and, as that, Shattered Memories is one of the most story focused action game I've ever seen. So much of this game is spent reading posters, listening to voice mail, chasing ghosts and having conversations. There are many action scenes, but those live somewhat seperate from the bulk of the game. Essentially, in Shattered Memories' interpretation of Silent Hill, the normal world is mostly normal. It's empty, filled with ghosts and most of the roads are snowed in except for when you're being driven somewhere. But, in line with normalcy, there are no monsters. Making the nightmare world actually feel very distinct in both gameplay and level desing.

There's a level of intelligence in Shattered Memories that many other silent hill games do not have. All of the other western made silent hill games tried so hard to please the fans. But Shattered Memories has no time for that. It pays passing nods, and tangentially it is a silent hill game. But, in application, it's very much it's own thing. It is perhaps the most experimental the series has ever got.

Real reviewers like to describe parts they like, and since I'm a fake reviewer, I'll copy them and make it seem like this is a real review! There's this part where you have to arrange bubblegums in the correct order based on the beak patterns of a toucan. Because this is a silent hill game and puzzles make sense.

Anyway, the caveat is that the toucan is thirty seconds of running around in enemy territory away. And, once you're there, you either have to commit the colors on the beak to memory, write them down or whip out your phone in the game, take a picture, and use that picture back at the bubblegum machine. All while creatures are roaming around. It's super tense.
And it's not the only clever nightmare moment in the game. There's one where you have to gather pictures of girls in the shower. There's one where you're trapped in a labyrinth of repating doors and rooms and you have to figure out the pattern somehow. And there's the final one where you have to run and swim as far as you can, while underneat are frozen statues representing significant events. There's also the one where you're in a car at the bottom of the river and suddenly a hand slams into the window.

My favourite moment might be the therapy session where you are told a story about a princess who dies under unceremonious circumstances. The goal ends up being to chose which of the story's characters are most or least guilty for her death. The twist being that her death hardly has a guilty party. She dies getting trampled by a bull, afterall. Yet, there is definitely stuff the characters, including the princess herself, could've done to avoid the situation getting so catastrophic. In the end, I can never chose which is most guilty. Sometimes I blame the bull and sometimes I put him as the least guilty party.

It's strong stuff.",1702948408,1702948408,True,0,0,0.436830848455429077,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The story might not be as invigorating or as involved as the previous games, but I think that is by design. It seems that the tone of this game was set to match its protagonist ""Venom Snake"" which makes a lot of sense whence you find out who ""Venom Snake"" really is. 

I think it matches well with the lack of dialogue from the character, as well as input in his situation. He was built up to be fooled, himself, as well as others into thinking he was who he is sought to be. Now without spoilers to the story and origins of ""Venom Snake"", it is a great thing to uncover. Especially if you have played ground zeroes which leads right into this game. 

The story of THE Snake is quite the interesting one and worth uncovering, but to save yourself the confusion, go play MGS3, then portable and peace walker to get the full story up until ground zeroes. Otherwise you will be very confused with major plot points and key characters that are integral to the lore of the franchise.

The game can feel somewhat disconnected from the narrative and kind of padded which was obviously done intentionally to sell itself to a wider audience.

But the repetition of this game, ESPECIALLY towards the back end of it, can make it a slog to play through. Also, whereas most stealth games would have killing enemies be the easiest route, but can lead to some lasting consequences, this game makes it that killing enemies is just... pointless? shooting sleeping darts and cqc'ing enemies is the way easier route to getting rid of enemies, plus you can later recruit them. You kind of have to go out of your way to kill enemies, which gives you no benefit, so there's no reason to do it.

So what's the problem? The game is simply unfinished. It is obvious that the rest of the scenario, the missions of second chapter and the features of open world (it is quite empty) were abandoned / messed up due to the conflict between producer Kojima and publisher Konami. Unfortunately, the game does not have a real ending. The second chapter of the game is actually the copy-paste of chapter one.

Also consider that this may be the last 'true' entry in the MGS series now that Hideo Kojima has left Konami, since they still own the IP.

[[Note: You can find out about modding the PC version by looking up the Snakebite mod manager. There are lots of helpful mods that adjust various aspects of the game. I am able to use my helicopter to travel in the open world now, when previously it could only be used for extraction or air support - Check out mods like Infinite Heaven, IHHook, and Zeta to get started]]

MGSV is a great free roaming action-espionage game where you get to build a base of operations and manage your personal army. To unlock new resources and actions you need to complete the story missions, so even if you spend lots of hours doing free roam, you won't actually make any progress towards improving your army - keep this in mind if you feel like the game is getting boring. The game starts in Afghanistan and after doing about 20 story missions there you can also visit South Africa.

You need to use the research and development unit to unlock new items, even if you aren't going to use them. Sometimes an item you DO want is hidden behind an item that doesn't look very interesting (e.g I unlocked a non-lethal shotgun behind a lethal one, which was good for knocking out enemies quickly in close range fights). There is one specialist you will rescue in a mission who allows you to customise guns, and then you can do things like add silencers to your rifles, new scopes, laser sights, different loading mechanisms, and also underbarrel grenade launchers and shotguns - one of my favourite guns I put together is a tranquiliser sniper rifle with shotgun attachment, to put distant enemies asleep for capture or quickly take out anyone who catches me by surprise up close.

Enemies respond to your tactics and the gameplay forces you to mix things up, e.g if you  are always getting headshots, enemies will start to wear helmets to force you to be very accurate (aim for the face) or try a different kind of weapon, if you are using smoke or gas grenades all the time they start to wear gas masks, constantly attack bases at night and they will wear night vision goggles (you can blind them by shining a flashlight in their face) - it feels like you are fighting a responsive enemy who care about their assets.

The base management aspect can be as complex as you like, with a single button to auto-sort staff into their best departments, or you can personally place everyone into their best spot to maximise efficiency. Auto-placement doesn't consider negative traits, so sometimes a staff member might start fights with other people and they all end up in sick bay which actually reduces your base level.

As well as being able to capture enemy infantry to grow your army, you can also find some specialists to give access to unique weapons and skills, and also discover some special allies with totally unique abilities which change the way you play the game - each one has a 'bond level' which goes up as you use them, and a higher bond level unlocks new moves for them.

The game does award full stealth (zero enemy detection or alarms) and non-lethal approaches the most, but you shouldn't feel bad for deciding to kill enemies, because you can easily make up the lost money by replaying those missions with a different loadout at any time.

The game can probably be completed in about 40 hours, but if you spend time experimenting with different items, and trying different approaches to complete all of the bonus objectives in every mission, you can easily get a few hundred hours or more in the single player mode.",1674231421,1702129215,True,1,0,0.535714268684387207,0,True,False,False

I always play with stealth in mind and this game pretty much shows what a stealth game should have when it comes down to mechanics and npc design, there's many key components you have to keep in mind while infiltrating a base, what kind of uniforms you're bringing onto the field (camo uniforms, sneaking suits ect.) matter a lot, lighting, shadows, foliage, terrain, sound and many other components that make stealth fun, mobile, adaptive at times and can give players a challenge at times. Weapon mechanics are somewhat clunky at times for new players but most of the time if you know how the mechanics actually work they'll be fun to work with and can be smooth as butter. Also this game being available on PC makes it even better because of the modding platform the developers have given to the community to create their own mods and enjoy the game with a new look.

The convoluted story didn’t interest me & turned me off. Plus, I became bogged down with the excessive complexity of the gameplay. I studied & learned it, but did not find it very rewarding. All that big effort was not worth it. I prefer a simpler gameplay like in Hitman.

As well, I didn't like the terrible open world in MGS5. The open world is huge but there's nothing to do in it besides the bases where the missions take place. There are no points of interest, there's nothing to discover, nothing to interact with, no people to encounter, no easter eggs, nothing. In contrast, Mad Max's open world is interesting & beautiful, with lots to do & discover, as well as people to interact with.

The Good
-Graphics are very nice even when ran on a toaster
-Music Tapes are fantastic
-The free form movement is fantastic everything transitions into each other like a knife through butter
-The iDroid is both a blessing and a curse
-MGO3 when it wasn't dead was fun

The Bad
-Maps are dummy large
-This pulls heavily from peace walker down to the insanely mind numbing repetitive mission structure and prep system
-Reflex is a small cut size bandage on a shotgun sized wound that is punished by the game
-Little to no crawl spaces which makes a staple stealth tactic of using crawling moot when crouch walking gets the job done better faster
(-no FPS aim leaning this is a very personal gripe because it makes shooting around corners a hassle now that it's gone)
-The new item/weapon menu is just like peace walker; a clunky real time mess that adds unnecessary tension where there doesn't need to be

The Ugly
-Denuvo (this implementation isn't horrendous but.... it's still denuvo which means the game is a ticking ownership time-bomb until it's removed)
-The story is anticlimactic (I did like the ending twist since it's some nice fan service)
-Enemy AI is both stupid and way too intelligent at the same time sometimes they will ignore a comrades foot sticking out of the brush other times when in alert phase they have ridiculous clairvoyance in situations where it should be a search then shoot phase because you are nowhere near line of sight nor even in the same locale as where you were spotted.
-Ally's outside Quiet and the D-walker are only really fun for about a minute (because Quiet picks off the chaff and provides cover fire, while D-walker is the best mobility buddy)

It's okay and for it's current asking price you could certainly do worse.

A gameplay experience hammered into a fine diamond by an early access demo, dragged backwards by unfinished missions and lack of finality. Storylines dropped, never to be picked up again.

I’m not really a fan of base building as a way to gain resources, but MGSV integrates it better into the larger story than most I’ve played. This keeps it from being a drag but adds the minor annoyance for first play through perfectionists to make the perfect team at all times. Can wear down on the fun. 

But enough negativity, I still recommend this game for the insanely good gameplay loop. Stealth had never made more sense to me than when it had in MGSV. Gadgets, distractions and equipment while both optional and essential depending on playstyles. I really felt like I made this version of Snake on my own with Kojimas guidance and blessing. A real “anyone can wear the mask” type gameplay moment.

The intro mission for this game is one of the best I’ve ever played. Escalating set pieces that by themselves could be ridiculous, but together weave into the first Afghanistan mission perfectly setting both the stakes and motivations for the player. 

I enjoyed Skull Face and his motivations, I thought the language based virus was incredibly creative and a great accompaniment to Kojima’s other stories in MGS. Quiet is whatever, a little too horned up teenage boy for me but I understand she’s a device to get people to listen. Outer Heaven is great and the team you build comradely makes it hard to do certain missions.

The trouble with the final year of  development are famous for basically being the swan song of Konami’s hiatus from producing video games (come on, Castlevania is too popular right now to leave that money on the table make something new) but it really highlights what could have been with the leaked concepts. 

I chose to stop when I stopped having fun and look up the disappointing ending for myself. I hope other people do that too. I’ll never forget those early hours, and for that it’s a great game.

The Story

As expected from a Kojima game, the game has an excellent
storytelling.
TPP's main quests are excellent. The story has two parts, with the second being the same as the first, but harder and with new levels.

Gameplay

TPP is an open-world Metal Gear. You must gather resources to enhance your weapons and base. You have various options to infiltrate enemy bases, including stealth using CQC or shooting your way through. You can also have a companion, with Dog and Quiet being excellent choices.

Characters

As expected of Metal Gear, the characters are excellent, with a great backstory. Compared to the other characters, Venom Snake lacks charisma and seems to be emotionally reserved. Ocelot is ""pretty good"", this time being portrayed as an ally rather than an enemy, showing a different side to him. Kaz is here, to support you in good and bad times.

The balance of stealth and action mechanics blend seamlessly, letting you experiment in your approach to complete the mission. Story wise, it just falls flat. Whatever the reason might be, the story was rushed, and the fans got robbed of a satisfying ending. The marketing promised the missing link, but it only offered a retcon while adding even more questions. 

The story starts off strong, even though it's an on rails segment. After that, the game opens up to an open world and business management sim. You can opt to start missions from the menu, which fast travels you to that location, or you can navigate the open world and walk into most of the missions yourself. There's a lot to be said about the gratuitous opening credits for each mission, which can also spoil boss encounters for missions that would otherwise look trivial. 

Sneaking feels intuitive, and Snake has plenty of ways to move and distract guards, even without unlocking all the fancy gadgets. The cardboard box not only acts in the way you expect, but you can also use it to slide down hills, add posters (with varying effects), and use it as fast travel in specific situations (an often overlooked classic feature of the franchise).

The combat is amazing, although the CQC might be a bit overpowered at times, as Snake can pretty much instantly knock out enemies. The weapons feel good and there's a great variety to choose from and upgrade. 

The level design, however, is not so great. Due to the open world nature of the game, you'll be driving through nothingness most of the time. You may occasionally encounter a patrol driving by, and see a little bit of wildlife (which you can rescue). But other than that, it's a lifeless environment. The game makes a big deal about the regions being combat zones, but somehow you never encounter opposing forces fighting each other. MGS4 had a similar presence, and even had you navigate active conflict, sneaking through the crossfire. It's a shame MGS5 didn't build upon that. The actual locations you can visit are also just open air bases, with very little interiors to sneak through. Gone are the days of navigating tight corridors. You'll rarely be unaware of enemies in your surrounding.

its as unique, ground breaking, ridicilous, fun, self-aware, twisted, mysterious, engaging, beautiful, dramatic and hillarious  as pretty much any other MGS game made by kojima.
i said unique first and foremost because all MGS games made by kojima are wildly different, yet somehow share an incredibly strong iconic theme.

this was my first MGS game, and now having completed the entire game for the third time now, and having listened to every single cassete tape many times, i am absolutely unable to stop and put it down because its so unbelievably fun, engaging and im still discovering lore details, still discovering new gameplay mechanics many of which mightve not even be intended by the creators, but all of the games systems communicate between each other so perfectly that it really is a ""true"" sandbox experience, that is, best sandbox experience i have ever had in my life.



and god this game is POLISHED, it runs maxed out at 6K res at 100fps avg for me. i havent seen it stutter once. when i try to run gta 4 i cant even get a solid 60fps at 1440p, jesus. and by the way for its time this game looks pretty incredible with its dynamic lighting and weather, lovely yoji shinkawa design, and best cinematics direction ive ever seen in any game ever. so how the hell does it run so good? well fox engine is just optimized as hell, and its much more low poly than it seems, which just makes for amazing framerates. and you can basically run this on a potato, the steamdeck supports this natively and can pretty much crank it at 60fps.


hint0: max the settings. enable HBAO+ in nvidia control panel, optionally then turn off SSAO in game. framerate can be unlocked in the .ini file without any issues if you have +120hz. for unofficial ultrawide support there is a simple patch.exe found online. teeny bit of pc limitations there but the fix took me like 1 minute and id enjoy it even at 16:9 60fps just fine

tip1: play this immidiately.

tip2: take your time.

tip3: cassete tapes. do it. all of them. hell you can listen to them during sneaking, infiltration, traveling, while chilling in your heli managing motherbase staff and upgrades, it doesnt hurt. do it. there are also many smashin 80s music hits to collect all over the two open world maps and they are vibe AF, the atmosphere they create together with the game is just priceless.

tip4: this really isnt the game to tell you everything and to guide you like a toddler, you have to make beautiful gentle tender love to this game, insert your giga chonker deep into this treat and dont pull out until youve scaved the hongonga walls clean, king.

tip5: change up your playstyle, experiment, go wild, this game has the most ambitious dynamically reactive difficulty mechanic from any game, your enemy intelligently adapts to your exact tactics and methods and either starts effectively countering them with time or starts using your own medicine against you, this is absolutely incredible.

tip6: play with a controller, i never was a controller fan and spend majority of my time with a good mouse and FPS-type games, here the controller basically makes you rely less on just shooting like a a dickhead and will force you to experiment with much more fun and complex stealth strategies, you also get a finer touch of sneaking movement with the joystick, if you cant get a controller dont worry it plays perfect with KBM and default bindings and the dynamic difficulty will still give you hell eventually if you abuse one tactic over and over like a dumbass.

tip7: sneak. really. its great fun and rewarding as hell, dont just run and shoot lmao, i mean this game can handle perfectly any gameplay from driving and shooting a fucking tank to strategically using mines granades and mortars, to taking down armored vehicles with airstrikes and taking down enemy choppers with mounted miniguns, but its so much more fun and thrilling when you actually role-play your character, and use stealth first and foremost and only go for the all out guns blazing option when you are absolutely fucked. i mean this game has no rules, you could go full on revengeance psycho mode if you want, but roleplaying your character just makes it all that more immersive and intense. both stealth and non-lethality are greatly rewarded by both less trouble, and more staff on your side. and great fun while at it. also use that box! the awesome silly stuff like the baloon decoys, the cardboard box and the rocket arm are not just silly goofyshit, they are legit fun and useful gameplay tools, really explore all their mechanics.

tip8: try to really go for alot of CQC (close quarter combat) and especially try to learn all the different mechanics, like dropping someone from a ledge while climbing, hold-up, restrain, choke, combo take down multiple guards, disarm, etc. as wise cyborg ninja warrior once said, ""Only a fool trusts his life to a weapon"" you can really get alot of shit done with bare hands in this game. or rather everything. and role-play-wise CQC with stealth really should be the main thing you master, then spice it up with crazy gadgets and it gets insane, and then bring out the big guns when everything about your plan goes to shit. but of course do whatever you damn please, son!

besides that i also feel the game is a bit too easy, theres regenerating health unlike the previous Metal Gear games, and combat is a bit too fluid and responsive, which wouldnt be an issue, if this wasnt a stealth game, the end result is that, theres not much punishment for being spotted

also by the endgame you are just too overpowered, in fact, one of my favorite missions take place in the padded second half of the game, because you are FORCED, to go in with no equipment, to ""Subsist"" off enemy equipment, i thought it was pretty fun, theres technically an incentive to not go fully loaded on missions, since the more equipment you have the more expensive your deployment is, but honestly, by the endgame you are making so much cash it hardly even matters

oh, also the story is contrived, terrible, boring, barely even there and nearly all the characters old and new are as plain as a cracker, which is borderline sacrilege for a Metal Gear game

that being said, the game just plays great, its easily the best playing game in the franchise, you can dive, climb, crawl and CQC to your hearts content, and it never feels awkward, like in MGS1, or takes a long time to master, like MGS3, its just great and gives you many ways to proceed

i also enjoy the amount of gadgets you have access to, specially non-lethal weapons, such as guns that fire rubber bullets stunning enemies, gas grenades that make the enemies fall asleep, decoy balloons that look like snake and electrocute enemies that try to pop em with their knives, its just amazing, its a shame enemies dont really keep up with your gadgets but thats beside the point

enemy AI is also amazing and its a shame hardly anyone seems to notice, they investigate suspicious activities, they ask for fire support, they usually search for you in pairs and will try to surround an obstacle you might be hiding behind to prevent your escape, its just great and i hardly ever see them do something dumb that isnt INTENTIONALLY dumb, like being fooled my a pretty woman in a poster

the game is open world, some criticize it because its a very empty open world, which is true, but i still like it because it usually means you have several entry points for the different outposts and bases you infiltrate, on that account, i believe its a successful design choice

finally theres the multiplayer, its dead, atleast the regular competitive kind, but the game also has a unique form of multiplayer, the FOB missions, where you basically infiltrate the bases of other players to steal stuff, these are invariably the hardest missions in the game, with guards often wearing night vision goggles, helmets, full body armor and heavy weaponry, plus the limited play area makes it very difficult to escape if spotted, not to mention you have a limited amount of time to finish the mission... AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT, the opposing player might be alerted of your intrusion and can attempt to stop you, the game is 8 years old and this still happens to me occasionally

the FOB invasions are fairly limited, they all take place in the same oil rig environment with minimal differences, you cannot bring vehicles, battle buddies or even certain pieces of equipment, but still they are very fun, also keep your mind off the grindy endgame (and the idiotic monetization konami introduced to alleviate it)

and as a last positive, the game is extremely long, much longer than any previous Metal Gear, that coupled with the FOB missions mean you will get your money's worth when you buy this",1699820114,1699820114,True,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

It's BOTH the best and the worst Metal Gear Solid game. The game mechanices are the best MGS yet. The story is the worst Metal Gear Solid yet. You'll definitely really enjoy this if you're new to the series, as the gameplay is pretty much the best it's EVER been! It plays very well! AI is much smarter this time. It's very well optimized! There's so many different items and ways to play! It's a beautiful game, and a lot of fun! The story depth though? Returning players may find it quite lacking compared to the previous games. I'd say it's the worst MGS in that regard. There's a lot that's simply not even shown while you're playing and you have to play tape recordings to get an idea of stuff that's going on. The famously (or infamously depending on your tastes) long cut scenes are pretty much absent in this game by comparison. The characters and bosses (or lack there of) aren't nearly as interesting as they used to be. There's also very little replayability beyond grinding sadly, and seems a bit cut short compared to older MGS games. 

At the end of the day though, I'd still say it's damn fun even if the story and world of MGS isn't as interesting as previous games. I'd still say MGS 3: Snake Eater is my favorite of the series. Get the game whether you're new to MGS or a returning fan. Just maybe lower your expectations just a tad on the story if you are a returning MGS fan.

Oh yeah, and the forced FOB thing is pretty annoying for those of us that just want a single player experience! Luckily, there are a few work arounds for that though.",1448489594,1699783819,True,9,0,0.565132677555084229,0,True,False,False

Update:

Six years and a hundred more hours later, this game holds up not just as the most mechanically satisfying game I've ever played, but as a narrative marvel. The original misgivings about the story that I had were proven wrong with the added context of Peace Walker (which I had not played at the time of initial review).

This game is truly a masterpiece, and given how many misunderstood games are given a critical re-evaluation several years after release, I'm sure we'll be seeing more and more people coming out to defend this game's narrative and the risky delivery method it chose to dole that narrative out.

The way this game deals with the warping of ideals, the concept of identity, the inherent oppression of shared language, the place of a soldier in a technologically evolving landscape, the banal rise of fascism... it juggles so many topics without ever dropping the ball. It's equally as dense in this single entry as the entire Metal Gear saga up to this point. It has more subtext than most novels.

I could go on all day about this, but there's better ways to experience what I'm talking about. Like playing this game. Even if you don't feel like pouring a hundred hours into the series so that this story makes sense, play it for the mechanics. Whatever your favorite third person shooter is, this game probably does it better.

The world probably doesn't need anymore Metal Gear Solid games, but we definitely need more games like Metal Gear Solid V.

metal gear solid V: the phantom pain is a action-adventure stealth game developed by kojima productions and published by konami. it's directed, written, and designed by hideo kojima and is his final work at konami. it's the ninth netal gear game in the mainline series, and is the sequel to ground zeroes, a stand-alone prequel that released a year before the phantom pain released. development began in 2010 after the release of mgs: peace walker and in 2012 they were openly recruiting staff for a ""next-gen MGS"" that targeted next-gen consoles with a brand new next-gen engine. the phantom pain eventually released for PS3, PS4, xbox 360, xbox one, and PC on september 1st, 2015 to overwhelmingly positive reviews, with some even today still considering it to be one of the greatest stealth games of all time. 

the phantom pain's biggest strength as a relative newcomer to the series (i had 100%'d ground zeroes before this but that's it) is easily the gameplay. the open-world afghanistan and african landscapes provide the player with unprecedented freedom, allowing for diverse approaches to missions of all kinds. that's before you even factor in the mother base system where you manage an entire military organization from top-to-bottom. there's a great blend/mix of stealth action gameplay, and base management that creates a unique and engaging experience that most developers wouldn't dream of pulling off. there's also kojima's awesome presentation where he employs such a crazy eye for detail it makes you appreciate not just the medium of video games but all kinds of cinematic artforms. while i want to sing the praises of kojima and his team regarding everything in the game, the narrative is a bit all over the place, and even seeing reviews from people who have played previous games, the narrative seems to stumble even for those players, with them citing a change of pace, going with less cutscenes which in my opinion ultimately led to a confusing story that needed more exposition in big cutscenes where villains/supporting characters deliver big juicy monologues (there actually is a lot of exposition and story-telling, but a large portion of it is done through audio logs that a large majority of players will sadly never go through). there's also the controversy surrounding the microtransactions, which i won't fully go into here but i needed to at the very least mention even if it's mostly irrelevant now. their inclusion was just odd, out of place, and really makes you wonder about the rumors about how the end of the game was rushed, yet they had time for this and other BS (apparently). 

despite the flaws, of which there are several (and even more i said nothing about), the phantom pain is a remarkable achievement in gaming as a industry, medium, everything. groundbreaking stealth action gameplay with technical prowess never before seen at the time set new standards for the industry and the strengths definitely overshadow the weaknesses, even with things that should be a deal breaker like unresolved narrative threads and divisive design choices. i definitely recommend grabbing this in the bundle with ground zeroes, as that's the most cost-effective way to play both of those games. i definitely think this is one of the best stealth-based games i've ever played, and it might be for quite some time.",1699687953,1699687953,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Cons

-Story not engaging
-Story absent from majority of the game
-Flat and uninspired antagonists
-Grinding for resources and money
-Some bosses are not killable or attackable
-Some bosses always know where you are
-Helicopter cutscenes are not skipable, you will see them after, before every mission and when you fly to Motherbase
-Motherbase spans kilometres but only a few rooms are possible to enter
-Forced to visit Motherbase every few missions else Snake starts to stink, flies surround him and he is spotted by the AI
-Visiting Motherbase serves no purpose other than taking a shower to avoid stinking
-Shallow and cheap story, very underwhelming
-Confusing and time consuming UI in the weapons and upgrade menu
-UI for setting up missions is slow and badly designed
-No interactions with NPC's other than outside of triggered cutscenes
-Freedom to solve a mission as you want is limited by main story mission design
-Freedom to play as you want is punished by a bad score
-Freedom to play as you want is punished by cosmetic changes on main character with attached negative side effects


Metal Gear Solid 5 is hard to recommend for the full price. You will get a game with solid shooting and stealth mechanics where everything else is not well designed or lacking in one way or another.

6.5/10 Phenomenal at its core, fails at crucial features.

On paper MGS:V sounds ill-suited for fans of the earlier games.

One aspect that continues to astound me is the sheer brilliance of its stealth mechanics, a testament to the tactical depth it brings to the table. However, I must confess that while the core gameplay is undeniably engaging, it does tend to fall into a somewhat repetitive loop: infiltrate the field, eliminate this target, neutralize that threat, and make a hasty exit. The helicopter rides, in particular, can feel like a never-ending bore.
I highly recommend using mods, and it's surprisingly easy to do so through platforms like Nexus using SnakeBite and other tools. These mods can transform the game into something uniquely your own, shaping it to your preferences. Among my personal favorites are ""Infinite Heaven"" and ""The Ultimate Phantom Pain."" These mods are game-changers, allowing you to fine-tune various aspects like enemy detection, hearing, patrol patterns, and even unlock the joy of free-roaming exploration. And yes, for those who can't stand the endless helicopter rides, there's even an option to skip them altogether!

In conclusion, as of 2023, it's handdown the best stealth-driven open-world game.",1698839092,1698839092,True,7,0,0.577254176139831543,0,True,False,False

Yeee there are a lot of cursed guns, the driving is passable. But again the gameplay mechanics compared to others in the series is far beyond. I really did wish there were civilians.

I had mixed feelings when I first played this game back in 2015. I enjoyed the game on my first playthrough, but I felt like something was missing (phantom pain ha) after seeing the ending, which made me feel kinda sour towards this game. And, I also think I had some open world fatigue at around the time this game came out.

But, after replaying some of the classic MGS games and coming back to this game, I've come to appreciate MGSV as one of the most interesting and dynamic systems-based games I've ever played. This is especially true now that I can play this game without completion anxiety pressuring me to burn through the critical path as quickly as possible (which I think is the worst way to play this game).

I see the classic MGS games as more ""dedicated stealth games"" but this game feels way more like a full-blown immersive sim to me - MGS4 was already kinda leaning in this direction, but MGSV really pushes it even further. There's so many different tactics to play around with and so many different ways for missions to play out - it truly never gets old. I find myself doing side-missions and even replaying old missions multiple times just because I love  experimenting with all the different ways to play.

I would recommend this game if you're a fan of games like Dishonored or Hitman or even just immersive sims in general. Even after 8 years, there's still not many AAA games that have this level of systemic depth executed to the same level of polish.",1441680932,1698641681,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good gameplay built off the back of Ground Zeroes, a good soundtrack, and an interesting story. However, where it falls apart is the open world. It's far too big for a stealth game. While this may not be a detriment to some, let me explain. Good stealth games need constraints. Little wiggle room to stealth in. It is simply far too easy to cheese enemies in this game or, if things get messed up, to hide somewhere and have the enemies forget about you pretty easily. There are also some moments where the difficulty jumps up severely (particularly with the Parasite units). As such, there needed to be a lot better balance between these two kinds of moments.

There is also a problem with the very unfinished ending. The story just kind of ends at one point, and getting to that point is frankly a chore. There's so much mission/side op spam I have to go through just for events to progress. Sometimes up to 3 side ops or missions for the game to ungate the plot, rather than making it feel natural. Especially when the side ops are really uninspired same-y quests each time, as well as a few harder replay missions that should've been left for the post-game. The story could've also been significantly trimmed down to help facilitate a cleaner ending. I think Hideo Kojima was attempting to be ambitious with the story, but definitely needed to rein in that ambition a bit. We don't get a good degree of closure from the main plot, since there are a few big things left unresolved, particularly with Eli (whose resolution was in cut content).

Kudos to the Kojima art team.

The stealth systems are both more realistic and more stupid than ever before in the series and along with the easter eggs and collectibles each mission has plenty of challenges that makes them fun to replay.

There is also the minigame of building and financing your own main hub which i never really cared about but its there if you like base building.

Imagine spending 20 minutes simply following two people (carefully bc stealth) waiting for them to have certain conversations just to end up getting spotted by some bs situation and having to start over and do the same thing (proceeding to fail in new different ways and waste another whole hour). Pretty fun.
Straight up terrible, never regretted tried to complete a game this much.

Too long; won't read: Awful physics, hitbox, movement, checkpoints (nonexistent), horse, progress information during missions (regarding objectives, score, detection, nothing), unnecesarily long roads towards mission objectives, base management mechanics, interface,  input keys, credits after every single mission and repetitive as it can get. Basically, everything is terrible lol

* The worst things may be the physics, hitbox, and movement mechanics, they suck.
* If it wasn't repetitive, 100 hours would turn into 10, no exaggeration.
* Your horse starts running away after you call it, which would be hillarious if it wasn't so annoying.
* There are practically no checkpoints (which are awfully distributed) and no way to save your game manually.
* The previous point means that you gotta move reeeally slow in order to avoid detection, but the second you mess it up you gotta do it all over again, the whole thing, as slow as before, or even slower. This would make a bit of sense, being a stealth game, but... 
* the fact that you get absolutely no feedback on how you're doing (apart from elapsed time) means that you gotta do it perfectly without any room for mistakes if you want to try and avoid going through the whole thing again.
* Sometimes you'll spend half an hour doing nothing (ie: following people around just to listen to some irrelevant conversations) simply to get detected near the end and have to restart all over, I'm far from done and already wasted hours that way, it's awful, one of the worst gaming experiences.
* What's more, sometimes you will retry the same repetitive mission over and over again from the very beginning (bc no checkpoints lol) because you get no informacion on how to proceed or what you are doing wrong, sometimes you will even fail the mission without knowing why, because the objectives are way too unclear and misleading.
* The game has you pointlessly walking or riding kilometers before reaching the mission spot, and there's a looot of waiting, waiting for people to move, for conversations to take place, and for development time, a cheap strategy to increase play time and make you pay real money for development time boosts, disgusting.
* The interface looks as if you had choosen the hardest difficulty, although there's no difficulty setting at all, and the aim of weapons has you using a rifle as if it was a shotgun.
* Why would you have to use the same key for every single action? Getting on the horse, jumping, climbing, diving to the ground, interacting, etc...???
* Base management is tedious and unnecesarily complicated, not-slightly-fun complicated.
* Is it really necessary to roll credits every single time you finish a mission? Regardless of whether you completed it already or not??? As if it wasn't enough to watch credits during the long and amazingly repetitive transitions when you start and finish a mission, or when you need to *manually* move from the helicopter to the base or viceversa according to the type of mission you want to start (there are only two types, having to select it from one place or the other is entirely pointless.

I may come back later on to check on my review and maybe it improves, but most likely it'll just get worse.
Update: It gets worse every hour. Constantly increasing in tediousness and unfairness, and when you think you're getting used to the awful mechanics (which doesn't make them less awful) you come across even more bs. If I could choose one game to never have bought out of every game I've owned, I wouldn't hesitate.",1695852906,1698170751,False,1,2,0.367099255323410034,2,True,False,False

One of the best in the MGS series, with amazing graphics (although aliasing is terrible at 1080p), some of the greatest and most well-thought out gameplay of any game ever, and an intriguing story that is amplified if you play Ground Zeroes and/or the other MGS games. Performance is outstanding, as the game was made for the PS3 originally, and the Fox Engine is ridiculously well optimized to the point of insanity. This game can run on any potato PC you could imagine. What amplifies this more, however, is a low-end graphics mod on Nexus mods that turns off shadows and makes the game look like garbage, but makes it so that even a literal toaster could run it, at least, if they couldn't run the game without it, that is.

But what knocks MGSV even further is the extreme bloat. There is so much unnecessary stuff crammed into this game that made it a pain to get through. Personnel and base management, resource gathering, research and development, online raiding, and a never-ending flow of repetitive side-missions all pad the runtime and the game is constantly shoving them in your face.

While the game has its strengths, they aren’t that great relative to the rest if the stealth genre. Meanwhile the weaknesses are so prevalent and pad out the runtime so much that it really limits my ability to recommend the game.

If you want to play it, just ignore everything that isn’t either a main mission or a side-op (at least for the first few before the repetitions get too old). At least then the game is pretty bearable and the 50 hours you’ll spend with it will at least be a decent time.

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a tour de force of stealth, storytelling, and innovation. With 13.7 hours invested in this sprawling open-world espionage epic, it's apparent that Hideo Kojima's swansong offers a truly unique and memorable gaming experience.

The Phantom Pain thrusts players into the role of Big Boss, or Punished ""Venom"" Snake, as he embarks on a quest for revenge against those who wronged him. The game's narrative unfolds with Kojima's signature complexity, mixing political intrigue, sci-fi elements, and deeply personal character arcs. While the storytelling is top-notch, it's also unapologetically obtuse and fragmented, which can be divisive, but it's a characteristic of the Metal Gear Solid series.

The game's open-world environment, set in various locations across Africa and Afghanistan, is massive and breathtakingly detailed. It's a sandbox where you have the freedom to approach missions and side activities with unparalleled creativity. The dynamic time of day, weather systems, and intricate level design make each mission feel like a unique and challenging puzzle.

One of The Phantom Pain's standout features is its robust and flexible gameplay mechanics. Stealth and tactical espionage action are at the forefront, and the options available for tackling situations are vast. From tranquilizer darts and silenced weapons to imaginative gadgets and companions, the game empowers players to experiment and adapt their playstyle to the situation.

Your companions, including the loyal D-Dog and the enigmatic Quiet, add depth and variety to the gameplay. Each companion has a unique set of skills, and their presence significantly impacts the tactics you employ, making the game feel dynamic and replayable.

The game's Fulton recovery system, which allows you to extract people and resources from the field, adds a quirky and entertaining element to the experience. Watching a goat or an enemy soldier being whisked away by a balloon is both humorous and oddly satisfying.

Metal Gear Solid V's presentation is another high point. The Fox Engine delivers stunning graphics and fluid animation, adding to the overall immersion of the game. The voice acting, with Kiefer Sutherland taking over as Snake, is superb, even though it marks a departure from David Hayter's iconic portrayal.

While The Phantom Pain is undoubtedly a remarkable game, it's not without its quirks. The story's disjointed nature, the uneven pacing, and the unfinished feeling of the final chapter can be divisive. Some players may also find the micropayments for certain in-game items and content to be a drawback.

In conclusion, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a triumph of ambition and innovation in the world of gaming. With 13.7 hours of gameplay, you've just begun to scratch the surface of its open-world possibilities and intricate storytelling. Its complex narrative and auteur-driven approach may not be for everyone, but those who appreciate deep storytelling and sophisticated gameplay mechanics will find it a tour de force. It's a unique and memorable opus in the Metal Gear Solid series and a fitting finale to Hideo Kojima's legacy with Konami.",1697716428,1697716428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game also features a base/soldier management system which I find to be very engaging. Most of the game (if not all of it) can be played non-lethally, if you prefer. This is consistent with the MGS series.

The only downside is that the game features a sort of Clash of Clans type system where other players can invade your base, kill/steal your soldiers, and steal your resources. There seems to be no way to opt out of this and it cant be deeply frustrating if you enjoy to take long breaks. You are able to ""lock"" some soldiers, however a majority of them are able to be lost if you get invaded enough. I hate this aspect of the game, however I feel that the positives greatly outweigh this.

Progression through the game is also rewarding in unique ways. Instead of guns simply getting stronger or the player getting more health, you gain new tools to use that make gameplay fun in new and refreshing ways,",1483653559,1697474785,True,0,0,0.494699656963348389,0,True,False,False

Thanks for checking out my recommendation and I hope what I say will be informational for you.

When the project for Metal Gear Solid V started, I was exhilarated. I bought my copy of Ground Zeroes and played it thoroughly, relishing the chance for yet another crack at Metal Gear, to play as Snake once again, to completely bamboozle and traumatize entire legions and bases full of enemies. I was hooked. I bought Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain for Xbox One, and fell in love... and then the love began to fade at some point.

What had happened, is in the initial opportunity to enjoy an open world game such as Phantom Pain, some people may explore everything they can, and get their enjoyment primarily in the way of just playing the free roam aspect of an open world game. I had done just that, and though I played halfway through the story, I stopped playing. In the following year I had moved to PC platform for good and forgot all about the game.
But, I always wondered... Wasn't I a HARDCORE Metal Gear Solid fan? I asked myself, why I stopped and what went wrong, as a shiny Steam Sale sticker was slapped on this thing that I so desperately longed for all that while ago. I found myself downloading the game to my PC in the same moment it became clear; the answers were all around me, and I was too reliant on the definitive Hideo Kojima experience; this is not the case with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.

Please allow me to explain.

The Metal Gear Solid franchise up to this point is heavily reliant on the extreme difficulty of active combat; It's how us gamers get our kicks. By making it incredibly difficult to actively fight the waves of enemies that appear during an ALERT phase, players are encouraged to and rewarded for stealthy gameplay (duh). Most games that aren't open world, can tailor the game front to back with exact levels of difficulty; would it be too easy to just get to the roof of a compound and walk over all the enemies below? Metal Gear will either make being on the roof riskier in some way, or flat out inaccessible for that compound, in the sense of the previous Metal Gear titles. The bottom line here is: There's a level to be cleared, and the developers worked very hard on staging it the way they did.

So what's different about Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain? Well as you know, when most game titles get their first open-world title in their series, they tend to be easier than the previous games in the series. Just look at Sonic Frontiers or Halo Infinite. Now, those games are incredibly enjoyable on their own without the further flaws that affect Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. This Metal Gear game adds on a few new mechanics that off the bat, make the game as easy as could be. These settings can and should be turned off for a more proper title experience; the settings that make the game easier (sapping the difficulty and ultimately ruining the fun) :

-Reflex Mode (Turn this off in Settings!)
Of course this would be the first to talk about. When a guard or security camera is about to detect you, the game goes into bullet time (Slow-Motion) to add a bunch of extra seconds for you to turn around, aim, line up the shot real good, and send a few. THIS is not good. You can stomp around everywhere and run out in the open in bases and if you're detected all you have to do is press Left Trigger (Auto-Aim) and Right Trigger (Fire). Turn off reflex mode so you can raise the alarm, raise some hell, and above all, raise your own self-respect. I found the game to be infinitely more fun and closer to the previous titles with this off.

-Markers (turn these off in settings!)
When observing an enemy on patrol with the Binoculars, they become Marked (linked to Snake's iDroid device) and you can now see that enemy in their entirety and observe their mannerisms wherever they go, even through walls. HOLD UP. Did Kojima just give me Wall Hacking? For reference, in the previous Metal Gear title, MGS4: The Guns of the Patriot, Solid Snake would have a Threat Ring Indicator. It was a ring around snake that would help snake keep track of obvious things on the field like guards on patrol by showing the GENERAL DIRECTION and GENERAL THREAT LEVEL of the enemies on the field around Snake. This was a much needed feature over the Radar from Metal Gear Solid 3, as the proximity, awareness, and number of enemy soldiers was very much increased; It was common for Snake to be literally squeezing between 2 or more guards at a time, full stealth.

Apart from those egregious 2 settings, the rest of the settings and core gameplay is absolutely amazing.

Speaking of former MGS titles, those respective games also had more punishing combat; even a single armed soldier could magazine dump Snake if you were not careful enough. In a game like Metal Gear Solid V, where you play the way you want: Loud, Stealth, or a healthy mix of the two, the combat is very much at a level meant to be enjoyed. Don't worry too much about being spotted; if the base goes on alert, losing the ALERT status is as easy as pie, provided you use some common sense or you have some experience playing the former titles. And if you can't figure out how to lose the ALERT in the moment, or just simply don't care too, whip out the iDroid, start up The Final Countdown (did you think I was gonna say, call in support chopper? that too if you wish ;)) in your music stash, and get ready for the most cinematic 80's style Michael Bay movie that you're about to star in; remember to be stylish and sick! The protagonist of this game is Venom Snake, who is the Boss snake but after he gets a really fucking cool demon horn stuck in his head so he gets a pass from really stressing over the absurd difficulty of traditional Metal Gear combat. 
*Just don't get shotgunned, fair bit of rage warning. I always send my troops out to topple the shotgun supply from the enemy, once you can send your troops out to burn enemy supplies and do other things.

This time around I am thoroughly enjoying the pacing and difficulty of the game, there's so much to do and so many ways to do it in! The game has a healthy palette of free roam objectives, side missions, Story Quests, base building, and even player base defense / player sabotage. This game isn't incredibly difficult, but with the Reflex Mode and Markers turned off, it isn't incredibly easy, either. The game is a pond of relaxation, creativity, and adventure. It may not compare to the absolute freezing or flaming lakes like Metal gear sold 3 and 4, (and most people only talk about the stories from 1 & 2 since even Kojima recommends skipping those because of the ancient and hard-to-use control schemes from those games. You gotta hold like ten different buttons just to take a single shot and the first bosses you run into are gonna need like a hundred of those with your shitty ass M1911A1 pistol), and if I had to give this game a bottom line? Go play Metal Gear Solid 3 or 4 first. This game just isn't that titular of an experience to really make you into a Metal Gear Solid fan, and the open world gameplay just won't make that much sense when you realize it's almost GTA but not quite, not quite enough that someone who has played GTA and not Metal Gear would enjoy this game. This game is definitely a treat for fans of Metal Gear, of Snake, and of course Hideo Kojima's sense of humor, which sounds a lot this time around like ""Hey, I know most war games are about killing, but what if I made one about.... kidnapping? Go bananas man.""",1697440850,1697440850,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Won because : stealth is really bad in this game, you can lay down and basically you're invisible. You can lay down and roll right under guards noses. 

Lost because : The stealth is broken and many guards literally have aimbot awareness and wall hacks - many times I've been spotted it was a guard just instantly spotting me often from hundreds of meters away - often times the way awareness works is just clearly very bad, they all come at your at the same time as if driven by psychic forces - For example, I shot at a guard, he spotted me, reflex slowed down time, and then a second later the bullet hit him - im 100% sure if reflex ended the entire base would have known my location. 

Never had fun : this is hard, I had fun, just not really in the intentional way the game makes you play, it's really not fun becaues so much of the missions are extremely bare bones - don't really do anything exciting, are very simple and dependent on stealth as a mechanic more than being about authentic simulation of afghanistan - some missions show that there's a deeper lore about that, but it isn't consistent and doesn't ever become a broader point *ie it's supposed to be afghanistan while being attacked by the ussr* 

I wish this game had more it certainly could have been a masterpiece if it just had more and it had better mechanics. Im very dissappointed in how it turned out and honestly I agree with the people who say quiet is a literal sex object, the plot and story were meh, trying to force people into online content and stuff, lots of this game was really bad ""lets see what we can get away with"" tier - just really tedious and bland after all",1563465071,1697153525,False,1,2,0.286487013101577759,0,True,False,False

This was my first experience of Metal Gear, I loved it and it was my introduction to a great series. This used to be one of those unplayed games in my library and I'm so glad I picked it up again after just checking it out the first time.

Easily the best stealth experience I've had in a game and overall very fun to play if you are into the genre. Not really into stealth? No problem you can totally take the loud and lethal approach if that's more your thing. You have a lot of freedom to choose how you would like to approach missions. There is a lot of different weapons and items to develop, lethal and non-lethal whichever matches your play style best. You also get tactical buddies you can take with you to help you out on missions like D-Horse, D-Dog, D-Walker and Quiet, each with their own abilities and customisation.

Another thing worth mentioning. While undertaking missions or just free roaming, you can find cassette tapes of 1980's songs and listen to them on your walkman or develop a loudspeaker for your chopper to annoy your enemies with. Try it out if you haven't already, the game just hits different with Gloria or Rebel Yell playing in the background. Even better, put your own music in the game! It's hilarious calling in a chopper to attack an outpost with Caramelldansen being blasted from the distance.

About the multiplayer... Technically there is multiplayer. I'm not talking about Metal Gear Online, that's a separate game. I'm talking about the FOB missions in The Phantom Pain. In this mode you invade other player's bases and try to capture staff and resources from them or you defend your base from invaders. In my opinion it kind of sucks, it's not really as fun as it may sound. The only way you can play with your friend is when they support you and you get invaded at the same time you are both playing the game so that they can help defend it. That scenario is very unlikely to happen. Eventhough I don't really enjoy the mode that much, there is some unique story content to it that I like that I've never seen in any other game before. I won't spoil it too much but you must know this story content is basically impossible to trigger alone and is extremely rare to happen in game. [spoiler]Players will eventually get the option to develop a nuclear weapon. You will have to invade every nuclear equipped player on your region's server and dispose of their nuclear weapons. Once the amount of nukes reaches 0 a special cutscene will play for everyone as far as I understand how this works.[/spoiler]

With that said I wish that we got a proper co-op mode too. I'm sure many others feel the same. I know Snake is a master solo infiltrator, but he still has his buddies to help him like mentioned in the beginning of this review! Imagine you could invite a real person to your game using your buddy slot. Then they pick one of your available combat unit staff or maybe even Quiet, since you can already play as her in FOB. Heck there's even enough seats in the chopper, and what kills me is the multiplayer component is already there! I can literally see and interact with my friend in a FOB training session!! We just need a co-op mode!!! I know this is all easier said than done, but I can't help to look at it and think wasted potential.

Now let's talk about the story, don't worry I won't spoil anything. You've probably heard it before and yes it's true, there is a pretty big part of the story missing. The first chapter is really good and feels complete. I was sucked in and eager to reveal more of the story as I played. After finishing the first chapter I had this kind of melancholic feeling because I've gotten so much into the game and people said the story is not all there. Knowing that, I didn't know what to expect next and I tried keeping my expectation's low.

The second chapter doesn't nearly feel as high quality as the first one and it's probably because of the Kojima breakup with Konami that happened at the time of this game's release. The second chapter has very few new missions and this is also when missions form the previous chapter starts showing up with higher difficulty. With only six new missions and the rest repeats, it really feels rushed in the end.

The game was literally not finished. There was supposed to be a Mission 51 that never made it into the game and if you bought the collectors edition you got an extra disc with it that contains cutscenes explaining the missing story parts. This clearly shows that there were more plans for it. I can understand why it got people upset who didn't buy the collectors edition at the time of release, I think everyone at least deserved to see what we could've gotten as a last mission. Fortunately these clips can easily be found on the internet so don't worry and go look it up after finishing the game.

I'd like to add my view on the story cassette tapes you obtain while progressing. I heard people say that this was how Kojima decided to shorten the cutscenes for MGSV. I think the tapes are a great way to get more details of the story if you wish to know more. You can put them on and listen to them as you are doing missions or side-ops. To me they were a lot better than finding long written notes that require you to pause to read them like a lot of other games do. Maybe longer cutscenes would've been nice, but I do get it that some people find very long cutscenes frustrating and MGS is apparently known for it's lengthy cutscenes.

I have to say that I did enjoy the story. Some older hardcore fans may say otherwise but I think it was great. Especially that twist in the end. It stuck with me for couple of days. (You'll know what I'm talking about if you played it). Like I mentioned, some disliked it, but since this game is set in a time before the event's of some of the previous MGS games, it makes sense and I wouldn't have wanted a different ending. I just wish the last ending made it into the game.

Overall this gets a well deserved 9/10 for the flawed masterpiece it is. It's painful to imagine the game we could have gotten if the rest was included. Maybe one day Hideo Kojima gets the rights back to his creation and finishes the story he wanted to tell. We can only hope, but for now we are here just to suffer.",1611333603,1696880847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of the best Metal Gear Solid games, gameplay wise. One of the best modern video games I have played, period. Now this is what a game should strive to be mechanically. MECHANICALLY, I don't think there is any game out there that can beat metal gear solid V phantom pain. I cannot emphasize this point enough which is that the controls FEEL GREAT. The camera movement is so smooth and responsive which is what makes this a great shooter especially at 60 FPS. What it lacked was just a tad bit in the story because I believe the game was rushed or they had disputes while making it. but what it lacked there, it for sure made up in gameplay. This is a really GOOD stealth game, Hideo Kojima is a genius... really pays attention to the details. 

I know this is a stealth game, but it has a bit of horror aspect to it too. I don't know what the right word for it is...it has a hint of psychological thriller or psychological horror? makes sense right? since Kojima likes to work on horror games too. Like the boss battles of this game really had me a bit terrified, as in scared to die cuz I really don't wanna lose >_<  such as while fighting the skulls. I know I can restart from checkpoint when I die, but I was actually worried about dying and tried my best to survive cuz yeah, fighting The Skulls is terrifying lmao. The way the music/sound effects play at certain moments of suspense, the way the environment gets fogged up when the Skulls show; it all has a scare factor/element to it. Throughout the progression of this game, I was worried about what's going to happen to Snake or his allies... cuz people can get hurt in this game real bad; we've seen that in Ground Zeroes. I'm saying that cuz the enemies did some f**ked up s*** (torture) to the good guys.

I don't know any other game that comes near this one. You have the option to engage in battle with enemies/engage in combat/go in guns blazing and kill them OR you can be complete stealth and sneak past them without even triggering a fight. you can do that for some of the boss fights too. And yeah, you can subdue the enemy in so many ways too...NO OTHER GAME I know that does that...this game is truly next-gen and a modern masterpiece imo. one of a kind.

The only thing I miss is the old sound effects like when Snake alerts the guards (!), the old music that we experienced in Metal gear solid 3 or 4, was not present in this game. They really changed it up in this game, even Snake's voice actor is not David Hayter anymore. But I suppose this isn't really the same type of game as the previous Metal Gear Solid games...Kojima really went for the horror aspect in this one. so it's different... Anyways, overall, gameplay is good and well worth it. I recommend it (Y). The game is a steal on sale.",1604614707,1696849489,True,1,0,0.466044813394546509,0,True,False,False

Luckily, after those 3 months i give it another try and that was the definitive one. I cant stop playing since then. Its not the history oriented game that Kojima get used us to like in MGS 4. Is a Peace Walker scheme with esteroids. What amazes me the most is that after all these years after the game realese, its the ammount of new discoveries and context interpretation you can learn if the game is submited into deep analysis. Some of the secret conversations in the side ops missions really makes sense if you know the proper context of the era that the game is based on. This is tipically a mix between sci fiction lore and historical real facts that Kojima used since idk... Policenauts. Also, its interesting to mention that the type of game narrative that V uses is based on a concept created in those early years. You can search 'What Even Happens in MGSV? Part One - Afghanistan' for more info.
In terms of gameplay: All is superB. From the stealth mechanics (which also, have little secrets here and there for the player to discover) to the buddies ones. You can customize pretty much a lot of stuff as you continue the main story and the side ops. 
The story finale is good too. Mind blowing plotwist right there in the very end, full of references and things that US, the player, can easily be related to. I feel that its the right ending for the saga even if a hole new chapter is missing or not. This is the end of an era.",1695992037,1696184337,True,1,1,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

I had been following the phenomenal trailers and gameplay videos closely, I had familiarized myself with the exotic yet convoluted storyline, and felt prepared to take on whatever story the game may contain.

So, did that pay off? In short, no. The story for first chapter is very good, but I wasn't left feeling confused. There are callbacks to previous games and there are many characters that obviously come from prior installments, but in the end, none of them were important. As a matter of fact, none of the characters felt very important. I could have enjoyed the story just as well, even if I didn't know the background.

That, in my opinion, isn't a very good thing. The story was all over the place, and to be honest, not very good. The progression of events is unnatural. Every time I felt like I was going to witness Big Boss finally become evil, it was switched and he came out the hero once again.

The ending, particularly, left a bitter taste in my mouth. It's a replay of the first mission, albeit with some alterations to the cutscenes to deliver it's final twist.

It's a hollow and tasteless ending, timed poorly and executed with the finesse of a bulldozer. And not in a charming Kojima way, this time.

Still. It's fun as all get out. The gameplay is amazing. Good enough that I still recommend this, despite everything above.",1442775738,1696132737,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Prepare to be immersed in a world where shadows hold secrets, and every step you take is a ballet of stealth and deception. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain isn't just a game; it's an opus of gaming artistry that transcends boundaries, weaving a tale that will haunt your thoughts long after you put down the controller.

From the very first moments, The Phantom Pain envelops you in a sense of foreboding and mystery. As Punished ""Venom"" Snake, you embark on a quest for revenge that takes you across a vast and meticulously crafted open world. This is a game that refuses to hold your hand, allowing you to approach missions and objectives with unparalleled freedom. The result is a sandbox of espionage where every decision is yours to make, every tactic yours to employ.

Kojima Productions has created a world that is as beautiful as it is desolate, with environments ranging from sun-scorched Afghan deserts to dense, rain-soaked jungles. The attention to detail is staggering, with every blade of grass and pebble telling a story of its own. The day-night cycle adds a layer of realism that affects both gameplay and strategy, encouraging you to adapt your approach to the ever-changing conditions.

The gameplay mechanics in The Phantom Pain are nothing short of revolutionary. The sheer variety of weapons, gadgets, and equipment at your disposal is staggering, allowing for a level of tactical creativity that is unmatched in the stealth-action genre. Whether you're tranquilizing guards, infiltrating enemy bases, or calling in supply drops, the game adapts to your style and rewards ingenuity.

The story, as is customary in the Metal Gear Solid series, is a masterclass in narrative complexity. It's a tale of betrayal, loyalty, and the blurred lines between hero and villain. The enigmatic characters you encounter are brilliantly written and brought to life by exceptional voice acting. The moments of sheer emotional intensity will stay with you, and the plot twists will leave your jaw on the floor.

And let's not forget the online component. Metal Gear Online breathes new life into the game, pitting players against each other in thrilling tactical battles that are as addictive as they are satisfying.

In conclusion, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is not just a game; it's a work of art that transcends the medium. It's a game that challenges your mind, tests your skills, and immerses you in a world of espionage and intrigue that few can match. It's a game that will have you questioning your every move, pondering its deep philosophical themes, and marveling at its technical brilliance. If you're a fan of gaming, it's an experience you simply cannot afford to miss. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a magnum opus that cements Hideo Kojima's legacy as a true gaming visionary.",1680831541,1695682410,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The filler missions (which where not too exciting to begin with) start repeating themselves halfway through the game, to not even get started on the side ops. But hey, i'm sure all of these ""Go there, grab X, get out"" required a whole list of skilled writers which you need to take a look at during the hour-long mission intros, along with a list of all the mother base staff, mission enemies and the names of Kojima, Kojima and Kojima.

Like Pequod and Morpho not having a co-pilot - unplayable!

While DD is mostly a good dog, he also likes to grab unconscious guards, waking them up and causing an alert, and he enjoys running in front of your tank while you're travelling at full speed and getting run over (the poor dog!!). Mount Horse while running is the prime example of ""Good idea, terribly done"". Snake may get stuck on not-too-covery cover or tent edges for no reason.
The game also thinks the default controller setup would come in handy, while you actually remapped some stuff and are playing with mouse and keyboard (iDroid navigation with keyboard is also awful). In Afghanistan you can't even drive around the godzillion of checkposts if you don't feel like taking them out for the 1000th time, because everything is cramped between impassable cliffs. If you're in a vehicle, you can drive straight through the main gate and blow everything up, but on foot, don't you dare moving without cover at night (enemy vehicles might still sniff you out anyway).

The Genre Is Tactical Stealth Action Shooting Combat

In Game CQC (Hand to Hand Combat Also Geart and well Develop)

In Graphic Perspective in According to year 2015 Very Impressive

The Game Based on Vocal Cord Parasite Basically Happpen is in The Skull Face is Developed This Virus and infected only Peoples who speak English if They Are Speak English Then That Parasite Suddenly Activate

The Game Set in 1984, nine years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes and eleven years before the events of the original Metal Gear

Gameplay is Very Good Also There is Lot of Stealth Equipments Available Also You if You Not Interested in Stealth you Can play Normally like Gun Shooting

If Are You Kill Enemies and Animals Rapidly Then Your Karma Level is Increasing and You Got Demon Snake and Your Horn is Growing and Showing Permanently Blood on Your body Yes Karna Also Exists in Game

What’s the more interesting story?

A: Phantom Pain was disappointing because it’s unfinished and Konami didn’t let Kojima finish it. enter joke about Pachinkos

B: Phantom Pain was disappointing because you were expecting a more traditional Metal Gear game. And while we can argue that it’s not a perfect game, just because it conveys information and context in tapes or doesn’t conclude one of its weakest subplots, doesn’t mean it’s bad. Saying it’s Konami’s faults means you believe Kojima could not make a bad game. And yet he is human, and not all videogame creators have made astonishing masterpieces. 

Controversies sell and are easier to explain to people who aren’t into the main discussion. It’s up to people whether they want to go deeper and find the truth or be fine with whatever a YouTuber tells you.

After you've let propaganda play you like a damn fiddle, but down the bow, and savor this game for what it is—a profoundly misunderstood anti-war masterpiece that ingeniously reinterprets Moby Dick, shifting its thematic focus from America to Japan.

I am really into Stealth games, but this was a let down.

the goods-
1- Good gameplay Mechanics
2- Graphics still holds up
3- Prologue was really good, they setup the characters well.

the bads-
1- HIDEO KOJIMA, nothing personal but within the 20 hrs of my playtime, i had to watch his name 200 times, i get it, Kojima is behind this game, but why do u need to spam the credits on my face every time i start and every time i finish a mission?

2- Open world, the open world is for names sake, its empty, the only point it serve is to make you go from point A to point B.

3- Repetitive, there's only two type of mission, its either kill/destroy or a fetch quest, it felt okay initially, but all the missions are basically u entering a restricted zone, kill some people and rescue someone, that's it. Everything is basically side missions no real hook or story.

4- Story, i loved the intro but that's it, in my 20hrs+ playing this game, i have seen like 2 other cut scenes related to the story, which are like 2 mins long. 

5- Weapons, tbh the weapons aren't bad but the fact that the first pistol u get doesn't make any sense at all is insane, i mean its a suppressed  pistol, good, but wtf does it start making sound whenever anyone spot u? 

6- UI is a mess.

7- Starting and ending each mission feels like u r playing a online/ multiplayer game. Huge immersion breaker for me.

This game is so full of FLUFF, FILLER and TEDIOUS activities that it takes away your interest every few or so minutes.

The skeleton of this game is great nonetheless but the mission structures, designs, flow designed surrounding the game mechanics is so foken mundane, empty and backdated that it makes me wonder if kojima is soo high smelling his fart that he couldnt notice such major flaws and dated designs and proudly implemented those mechanics in the game. i have seen people having the same complaint about death stranding that it has a fluffy design to padout the gametime and drive the players insane.

nonetheless, the final 10 to 15 hours was epic af. Each of the missions, setpieces and cutscenes felt as if they were handcrafted with immense care and love. if the the whole 50 hours of experience was as good as the last 15 hours then this game would have been the game of the century without a single shred of doubt.

Sigh....Kojima's narcissism had to ruin this game.

Metal gear solid V: one of the best if not the best stealth-action game. The gameplay is phenomenal, the amount of interactions between player, npcs, enemies, animals etc, the progression system, the weapon and tool variety, the methods enemies use to avoid your likely used takedown methods and so many other details and effort that where put into the game can not really be described easily, you have to experience it yourself. (You can play 90%+ of this game's missions brute force if you want to, get a LMG and rocket launcher and go nuts)

Although the story is not finished, for what is being offered, you will be satisfied, and it ties up perfectly with the franchise's story line, speaking of franchise, do you have to play the other games in order to play MGSV: ""no, this game can be experienced by itself, for reasons that i can not explain without spoiling about the game, it would be very helpful for you to understand the character's identity, their reasons behind certain actions etc if you look online about the other game's base, emphasis on base, story line and how it ties up with MGSV, after you played it of curse.""

The game has some pretty cool modding support on nexus if you are interested.

The only real drawback about MGSV in my opinion that i haven't seen many people mentioning is how Konami kinda fucks up the game with their MB coin system and the fact that Konami chains the game's progression and online save system, which is ties up with your own save, that has the following effect:
-Playing the game while being online makes the progression faster since it you obtain many free stuff, inherently making the game in a way easier and in some cases shorter, you are the own to decide if you want that or not, i would recommend against it, there is a mod on nexus mods that always launches the game on offline mode.
-Konami locks a shit ton of gear behind online play, many of these weapons are very strong early game and are online useful in the late game or during FOB missions (the online part of MGSV, which on paper was a great idea but with everyone pretty much scripting their ass out its literally unplayable), not using them on your singleplayer experience in my opinion is good since most of them are very powerful, however, if you want to use them later in the game or for replayability reasons, you will have to wait days for them to develop on top of the insane price that they have in order for you to deploy them in battle. (It sounds frustrating because konami literally made it to be, its like playing clash of clans at this point)
-Since your game save is tight up with the online one on Konami's server, which cannot be modified/deleted/altered (cheat engine can change some values but that not only would be hard for the average player, it can't really help aside from some specific things), experiencing this game again from the beginning, something myself and many others wanted to after a year or 2 of having played the game and finished it, is only doable if you family share MGSV with a second account that you would create only for this reason, since on that account you will have none of the online materials, weapons and other content that you unlocked previously on your first playthrough, on your main steam account.",1579966960,1693945290,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Ground zeroes was my first introduction to metal gear, and I was sold immediately. I had to follow-up and buy TPP. This game very quickly became one of my most played games on steam. I love the open world, the stealth mechanics, upgrades, and the general story line.

Damn, i started playing this game a long time ago and i still haven't made a review, so here it is.

Metal Gear Solid V GZ + PP are my favorite metal gear hands down in terms of gameplay, soundtracks and cutscenes. 

MGSV has a nice atmosphere, in my opinon the open world style fits pretty well in the Metal Gear Solid franchise. I love the camera shake for certain actions such as running, Snake's running animation is pretty realistic, the CQC system is nice, i like the action that this game has, the weapon system + upgrades you can make and the gunplay, the cutscenes, the dialogues, i really like the buddy system where you can recruit 4 possible buddies and bring them to your mission, i FUCKING LOVE the 80s music tapes you find in the radios by exploring enemy bases (you can listen to those musics anytime you want and also when you visit Quiet's place at mother base).

About the story, so far i'm enjoying the story but, my friends tell me that the ending of this game doesn't go anywhere so, i'm a bit worried about it, even if i don't like the ending, i'll still love MGSV. I hate the fact that Hideo Kojima got fired from Konami, with that he couldn't finish the game in the way he wanted, thats why when you're close to the ending, some missions will be repeated but, alot harder.

As i said in my MGSV Ground Zeroes review, the way how GZ's atmosphere/feeling is shown, made me really hyped to play the Phanton Pain, but as soon as i played Phanton Pain, i felt that it lost a bit of the Ground Zeroes essense. I'm not saying Phantom Pain is bad, i don't think that, i love Phanton Pain. 

Even though MGSV is a 2013~2015 game, i still love its graphics, textures, weather effects, lighting and sound effects.

Ik some people may not agree with me, but thats all i had to say. 

PS: Don't upgrade your prosthetic arm to mobility 3 cuz, Snake's runing animation gets broken  since he can run faster, it gets even more broken while carrying someone on your back, if you do this upgrade there is no turning back, unless you install infinite heaven mod, you can disable mobility 3 there. (though i must say that the game gets a bit easier if you do the mobility 3 upgrade. So its up to you to decide what you're gonna do.)

PSS: There is a 1% chance that the Metal Gear franchise will be as good as it was without Hideo Kojima, i could be wrong though :/

I hope this review helps people decide on whether buying the game or not.",1692120841,1693662841,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But gameplay-wise, this is a very meticulous stealth simulator. Your success depends on how you use the weather to your advantage, whether you sabotage the enemy comms or not, whether you disable the local anti-air radar to allow your own chopper to land, etc. Failures are unforgiving since the enemies have 100% shooting accuracy from any distance and alerts can turn ugly, I mean enemy-choppers-flying -in-the-sky-blasting -your-hiding-spot kind of ugly. 

The enemy also adapts to your tactics, meaning if youre used to shooting enemies in slowmo as you get detected from a distance, well guess what, they start wearing body armors. Using smokes and sleep grenades? They start wearing gas masks. And if you start causing a lot of noises? They will kill the prisoners a.k.a. your rescue targets. 

But the fights aren't one-sided. You can always send your own crew to sabotage their line of supply, ensure they don't get their delivery of body armor/security cameras. Place mines on patrol routes. Equip your chopper with weapons so that it can fend off any pursuers when you're making a close escape. 

So yes, if you're into military-style stealth infiltration gameplay, pick this up.

The game has a lot to offer in terms of a stealth game with just the sheer amount of content it offers, The open world is interconnected with tons of things to do. The variety of equipment is overwhelming and can change up your play style completely. However, the most impressive thing about this game may very well be the enemy AI. Its incredibly smart and the guys you go against feel like a living army and they adapt to how you handle situations. You headshot tranq people all the time? Enemies will start wearing helmets. You bum rush people with CQC? They'll start using riot shields to push you back. There are so many more examples of the enemy AI adapting to your play style its honestly genius. This game would almost be perfect if it wasn't for one really big issue... the game was rushed. Konami didn't let Kojima finish the game and it obviously shows. Chapter 1 (which is roughly 35 hours of gameplay) is great and I have pretty much no complaints with it. However Chapter 2 is where the game falls apart. The story ramps up very fast but the missions are mostly just harder difficulty repeats of previous missions. I'd say its worth playing through to the end however because that ending cutscene is one of the most satisfying cutscenes I've ever watched. The story isn't finished but the way it ended was good. Oh and one more thing, MISSION 45 IS A BIG PILE OF GARBAGE! Save yourself the hassle and look up a guide on how to cheese it before you go into it.

I've been searching a long time for an experience like this. I've melted because of the fear I have in my heart that we would not get another supreme game from Kojima. BUT.

Id give my life, not for honor but for Kojima. In all my gamer time there has been no one else that has captivated me this much. Crime? No thank you. Id rather fly away in my dreams right back to snake eater.

Some days when you cant find anything to do you want to go for a walk through the rain. Other days you want to feed on a tree frog. I mean you could eat it if you're trying to survive but believe me this game is your new light.

Believe me when I say.

You'll give you life not for honor but for Kojima. You will spend your remaining time looking for someone other than Kojima to obsess over. You'll even turn to crime... Its not the way though. Just close your eyes and fly in your dreams and find snake eater. It willbe worth it.",1693172611,1693173517,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That out of the way, let me just say that the freedom of choice that this game provides when tackling missions should be paramount in all game design of this nature. The work that Kojima and his team put in to ensure that every strategy is viable, however silly or serious, oozes in all aspects of the game. You want to sneak your way through a heavy guarded camp and not get detected? You can do that. Want to go in guns blazing and kill everyone on sight? You can do that. Want to call airstrikes and helicopters to level out the camp? You can do that. Want to have your sniper buddy kill everyone while you just sit back and watch? You can do that. Want to throw decoys at guards' heads to knock them out? You can do that too. The variety of methods to approach a mission is practically limitless. There are also few missions where there are unique ways to complete the objective. Some may require thinking outside of the box, wink wink.

The story is mostly intact, albeit the ending left me wanting more. But I guess that was the point? To leave the player with a sort of, phantom pain. I will say, Kojima Productions learned after MGS4 because there aren't nearly as many cut scenes in this title, instead all the focus was drawn completely to the game play this time around. At the end of the day, you will spend much more time in the game play than the cut scenes. And while its not everyone's cup of tea, the cassette tapes really do a great job at fleshing out the story. What I thought initially as a mundane and uninspired way to flesh out the narrative turned out to be a very good method of delivering the story in a non intrusive way. For one, the quality of the voice actors is absolutely superb, the lines are delivered with care and attention. Second, it allows you to contextualize the story without interrupting game play. This is because you can play the tapes while actively playing the game.

Lastly, you have the base building that tidies things up. You build your own private military from the ground up and develop all sorts of gadgets and weapons to further assist you in the battlefield. You also have the choice to recruit new faces to your bases which not only allows you to make new equipment but also provides further battlefield enhancements. For instance, by upgrading your intelligence team, you will have better ideas of the weather patterns and predicted enemy movements. The support tree will grant you access to artillery, helicopter support, or even smoke dispersal. Its a fun meta game to break up the pace and at no point does it feel like a complete necessity or burden. In fact, the more you pour into the base, the harder it hurts later on. 

All in all, it saddens me to say that I do not think we will ever see a title like MGSV. A game with complete freedom in a military environment. This game was way ahead of its time and you should certainly give it a try if you are looking for your next title to play.",1693164863,1693164863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Okay game - not bad but you can skip it or try on sale.
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional notes: I tried... I really tried, but the more this series goes, and the less I am interested in it. While I did and consider the first two Metal Gear as good, and MGS1 as a masterpiece, MGS2 then 3 then 4 and now 5 just get less and less enticing. I pushed much further than I should have because the looong intro in the hospital made me believe in a game that was never to come. I spent dozens of hours in Afghanistan doing sub quests... for nothing much in return. The scenario is so slow, the pace is so soporific, no wonder Kojima then left to do Death Stranding... this is the bridge between his two series here. But for me, that is too open space, too slow, and also too repetitive: so many missions in this huge ""open world"" (not really) which is so similar all throughout (I mean, afghan mountains...). Sad because the gameplay is topnotch, really impeccable, typical japanese gameplay craftsmanship. But I did not even reach the second level (Africa), and I heard (?) that it was the only two... how underwhelming is that? If you do an open space/world game, make it change. MGS was a masterpiece because not only it was a huis clos (one location in closed environment for the whole narration) but it was extremely rich in environments and variation of surroundings, despite that one location setting. Unfortunately I won't have the end of the scenario but eh, the more the series went and the more it was ""much ado about nothing""... Still, if you like stealth and realism mixed with fantasy/sci-fi/technology, it is still an okay game. Just not enough for me to call it anything great nor to finish it.",1693021232,1693021232,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is going to be a very long review, as I have many feelings I wanna talk about with this game. However, if you just want to know if you want to get this game...yes. This game succeeds with both gameplay and story, even if it is the weakest in the MGS series (more on those later), but just make sure you play Ground Zeroes first. A little warning...I may be a little biased as I have grown up with MGS, especially MGSV, as I remember being a little kid arriving in Afghanistan (but I never even rescued Miller). This experience on Steam was basically a fresh and new experience, even though I've been spoiled. Not to drag on this intro, but it may be a bit rambly...because I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about this game.
As of writing this review, I have 180-ish hours of in-game time that wasn't spent waiting for stuff to develop or materials to process and have just 100% the game. I have enjoyed really every hour of this game...even if a few of those hours I spent being either extremely annoyed or very pissed off because a lot of the things that happen in this game are super aggravating.

Now, I'm going to start with the story, as it's the most obvious and simple to get through. As with every Kojima title before, the story is amazing. This is one of two MGS games I have actually cried to (mission 43 if you wanted to know). Though, I will agree that it is the weakest story in the MGS lineup, as it's a little bit of a mess. I'm going to split up the story into three parts: Part One (1-12), Part Two (13-31), and Part Three (Chapter 2). I love Part One with its excellent pacing and good and intriguing story, especially since most missions pushed the main story arc forward. Part Two is longer but I have the same thoughts about it. However, after the end of Chapter 1, or Mission 31, the game goes in a weird direction. Out of the 19 remaining missions, 12 of those are repeats of older missions, just being harder with total stealth, or no mission prep. This may have been because of the development process, but it sucks to see how much more we could've gotten. Don't get me wrong, Chapter Two isn't bad, as I cried during a part of the story there, but I think that it could've been done better. I have a massive problem with the missions, but I'll get to that later on. I just would've rather them cut these optional missions entirely because I don't like looking at them and they're very useless. At least you don't need to play them in order to progress the story.

Next to talk about is the Side Ops. I know it's weird to go here, but they offer a good amount of the story that I think improves the game. There are 157 Side Ops, seven of which are target practice and ten (I think) are ""important"" Side Ops, so there's really mainly 140~. I think the best ones that you should really play are ""Extract the Wandering Mother Base Soldier,"" as it's very fun and progresses the story in a subtle way, as they give you mementos that you can give a certain someone on the third floor of the medical plant. It's optional, sure, but it's important to see, I think. There are also animal extractions that give you the Wormhole Device and the Hand of Jehuty, but also the interpreters are important too. I didn't really enjoy the others nearly as much, as a lot of them are extracting prisoners or ""highly-skilled"" soldiers but...at my level...they weren't...

The stealth and gameplay in this game are also the best in the series. I never really got tired of sneaking around and being a complete badass because of how fun it was to do so. I remember about halfway through my playthrough, I stopped playing so I could play the original MGS from 1998 with a friend and I just realized how much more fun this game was to play... It makes me excited for the MGS3 remake. However, this is more with the hud but still, I wish they didn't remove so much. Like, I loved the health bar, stamina bar, and camo meter. Even though by Peace Walker the camo was kind of useless, I would've loved to have seen these. Instead, all you get now is this stupid jellyfish screen like it's some kind of COD game. I don't mind it, but I loved the bars so much. I like to see EXACTLY how much life I have left until I die. Though, I know this game wouldn't really have a stamina bar because you just don't deal with that in this game...but still.

Now comes my issues with the terrain in this game. Firstly, the game is open-world, which is interesting. I think it's a fun open world, but too big in the end. If you don't have a car, D-Horse, or a skin that makes you faster, it will take AGES to get from one side of the map to the other. During normal missions, this isn't usually a problem, except like Hellbound or another mission like that, but during Side Ops...it sucks ASS. No, I don't want to call in D-Horse just to shoo him away and get D-Dog back (which I will be calling DD). Not only does that cost a shitload of GMP but it's also time-consuming. WHICH WAS KIND OF THE WHOLE POINT OF CALLING OVER D-HORSE. I also just don't really like the cars in this game. They're super slow. I know they're just a little slower than D-Horse but it's still. So. Slow. I just don't like going from Point A to Point B because of how big this game is...either make Snake and everything else faster or make the world smaller (former please).

This is something that isn't going to apply to everyone, but it applies HEAVILY to me and I need to express how disappointed I am. This game is a very large game, having hundreds of hours of content. You can 100% this game, which is exactly what I did because I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH...but there's really no point. What do you get for finally getting that 100% number on your screen? Nothing. You don't get shit. You don't even get an achievement. I don't understand why the fans and completionists were done so dirty. Like...Raiden is a cool reward. That's really it. I guess Gray Fox is okay...(?)but they're not really as OP as I would've liked. Like...I just S-RANKED ALL THE STORY MISSIONS AND I CAN'T BE THE FASTEST THING IN THE GAME?? But what about S-Ranking all the missions?? Gold. Naked. Snake. Huh? Yeah, I had the same reaction. It's literally Naked Snake...but gold. You don't even get a normal Naked Snake model...just...silver and gold... What about getting all the mission objectives??? An achievement. Huh? Yeah, I said the same thing. Like, this game asks SO fucking much (which I will get into in a second) in order to get the triple digits on your screen, but in the end, there's no fucking point. I just wanted more from the completion side of this game, and I mean the REWARDS, and I'm just frankly disappointed. This is probably my second biggest problem with the game just because of how useless it is to have it, except for bragging rights.

Now for the final part of my review: the spoilers. [spoiler]First off, I love the twist that Venom Snake isn't Big Boss but really a doppelganger. It was built up well, foreshadowed well, and makes MG1 very interesting, knowing that wasn't Big Boss but really Venom. I do agree that it could've been built up more...just so it isn't so jarring whenever it's revealed, but I think it's good. I also really liked Skull Face as an antagonist, and also how they continued to build on how scummy and cucky Huey is. Fuck him, for real. I'm a little lost of what to say here, so I'm gonna leave it with that.[/spoiler]

I know I've mainly complained in this review, but that's because there are so many other reviews that talk about how amazing this game is. This game is a SOLID 9.5/10. I am so glad I played this game and experienced it because it isn't leaving my brain anytime soon. Please, if you read through this entire review and don't know if you should get it, get it. Metal Gear fan or not, get it. Even if you're not a big fan of stealth, I think there's something to like here.",1692266973,1692266973,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

One of the best moments in the game, ironically, comes from finding a cassette tape of ""Snake Eater"" (the theme song to Metal Gear Solid 3) in an enemy guard post: on my long journeys throughout the Angolan or Afghan wildernesses, I found myself listening to this tape often to reminisce on how great the series used to be. For lack of a better word, MGSV feels distinctly ""American,"" sacrificing plot development and attention to detail in level design (highlights of the best Japanese video games) in favor of raw, albeit addictive, action.

That being said, the game *is* fun in its own right, and the less you know about what the original trilogy had been, the more you will enjoy this. There is a certain appeal in sneaking into an enemy outpost with your sniper sidekick, tranquilizing the guards and catapulting them off to your home base with enormous balloons, and then coolly cruising out in the enemy's jeep with all their loot while ""True"" by Spandau Ballet plays. Yes, this all can happen in MGSV---and it will happen many, many times, as there are a lot of Generic Prisoners to rescue, a lot of Generic Soviet/Afrikaner Soldiers to capture or assassinate, and a lot of Tank Units and Armored Vehicle Units to steal or destroy. The game at times takes on an RPG element, where stats nerds (like myself) can fiddle around with deploying just the right strength and number of recruited troops to complete special missions; the gradual growth and defense of your base feels almost like customizing a house in The Sims.

As a bit of an MGS fanatic (Snake's Revenge is the only game I couldn't play through---and having never had a PS3 or PSP, I missed out on MGS4 and Peace Walker), I felt a sense of obligation to see this game through to the end, putting in approximately 225 hours to ensure I'd seen everything it had to offer. It is easy for me to recommend this game to non-fans (although beware: it took me three years, interrupted by work and academic life, to actually finish---note that less than 20% of buyers on Steam have apparently reached the full ending). It is with discomfort that I advise diehard Snake lovers to play it as well. It took me until the bitter end (and I do mean bitter) to change my mind on this, as a matter of fact: as dissatisfying as the last missions are, they make all the slogging through the repetitive side-missions (and higher-difficulty rehashes of earlier missions) worth it---simply watching these videos on YouTube, or reading the summaries on Wikipedia, will not do justice to the experience. Although I won't spoil anything, there's a certain immersion that has to be developed through playing the game in order for the ending(s) to make the impact that it does. 

If you really love MGS, you owe it to yourself and the series to put up with the radical changes in style: despite a certain ""Phantom Pain"" of your own that you'll undoubtedly feel after all is said and done, there's enough context here for the other games that is incredibly valuable and insightful. Again, without spoiling anything, quirky villains like Vamp and The Pain from past games make a ton more sense now (and Snake's Revenge could conceivably become canon as a result of this story). If you don't care about MGS at all, this is a very enjoyable, although time-consuming game (but just skip the cutscenes: Miller is always frothing at the mouth about Cipher, Huey is sniveling and gaslighting, Skull Face sounds like he's auditioning for a Shakespeare play, and Snake---now voiced by Kiefer Sutherland---seems to have become too expensive to say anything meaningful). It may not be a 5 out of 5 like every other game in the series, but it certainly is a 4.",1691952995,1691952995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a lot of expectations going into the game and i have to admit i thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a really fun game. The story was very complex and needs some understanding of the other games in the franchise to completely understand the game and characters. But looking at just phantom pain it still told a good story with some unexpected twists and great characters. One particular mission was really heartbreaking to play. The cinematic cutscenees were really cool. The gameplay and soundtrack was really good. The side missions were also good and i liked the dispatch missions a lot it was really fun and a great way to gather resources to develop motherbase. The main story could have been a little shorter as i felt some dragging in some places. Some of the missions require multiple attempts as they were really difficult. The story is kind of incomplete but it provides a exciting ending and builds up my interest to try the other games. Snake as the main lead was really good and quiet was my favorite character after snake. 
I recommend this game for everyone who likes action and a complex story.

Basically, I like this game but Jesus it's a fucking drag. This game has, in my opinion, the best mechanics and gameplay of the whole series but the setting is so boring. It gets brain rotting doing mission after mission and most of them are kinda copy paste. The story pacing is bad but the message that it's trying to tell is really good. Any game with big boss is always gonna have a lot of Anti-war narrative but I think this game just conveys its points and themes super well. I'd argue the ending leaves a lot to be desired, so I do think it harms the narrative a little. However, since it is a part of a long series with an even bigger narrative, it's not too bad overall. I do think the twist in this game is done really well and honestly just the characters are done well overall too. Game-play is really the only thing that holds this game back from being my favorite in the series; good systems but really bad mission and setting execution. Don't get me wrong this game can be fun af playing through stuff but a lot of tools you receive come as the game goes which adds to the dragging feeling.

TLDR: This game got a lot of good parts its just you might kys from brain rot due to pacing issues and repetitiveness at some points",1691376668,1691376826,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

The third Metal Gear I am playing (MGS, MGR and now MGSV), this one took me a while before getting used to the gameplay & the variety of keys/abilities. I admit I was a bit frustrated at first, but once you master it, you're in for a ride. The game is excellent.

[b]Why is it so good you ask?[/b]
- The storytelling and the voice acting are one of the best if not the best I've seen in a game, some shots & camera angles are truly inspired by what is being done in movies and when done well, like in this game, it has so much more impact on the messages,
- The atmostphere, even though it's almost entirely in desertic landscape, a lot of details has been put into the world to make it feel real and alive,
- The attention to details in every single aspect of the game is mindblowing,
- A total freedom on how you achieve your goals,
- The feeling of really belonging to the Diamond Dogs,
- The ending (even though... it's still wide open)
- The gameplay is smoooooooooth and on point,
- The cool companions you get on your missions and of course Quiet.

[b]There are some downsides though...[/b]
- Gets repetitive really quick,
- Some enemies placements are made to piss you off,
- Too many upgrades and yet so few slots for X or Y stuff/weapons.
- Where the fuck are Eli & The Third Child?! xD

To continue the story I need to play previous missions but w/ some difficulties [kinda strange decision if you ask me + Paz side story activation brings some questions])

I made a zoo, saved the world by implementing nuclear disarmament, my friend invented perfect hamburgers with our blood money, and there was a talking robot who said that I wasn't real. My favorite part was when I slid down a hill in a box.

The open world design allowing you to complete a mission in any way is initally what appealed to me, but add in the story after starting and it's captivating. I feel I could describe the story as one of revenge, hope, loss, and companionship. While some questions remain unanswered for me which may have originated in the previous installments, such as the burning man and the boy, I'm in no way disappointed. Barring a few annoyances such as the 1 audio file of looped humming, the sound design is wonderful and the visuals still look great 8 years on. I thoroughly enjoyed both the original scores and the music choice as they already happen to be some of my frequent listens.

I personally played with light mods to alleviate some audio bits like the prolonged humming, add in some foliage and actually put clothes on your companion. I understand the reason for the clothing choice, story wise and game design wise, but I didn't care for it.

It's unfortunate this is the last of Kojima's installment in this series after Konami's antics and that it's been stated the story is complete; I would really enjoy another game in this world and style. I'll definitely be picking up Death Stranding at some point to experience another of Kojima's stories. The same applies to P.T. and the Silent Hills project. I rarely play horror games but I enjoyed the movies and I think I'd have enjoyed his version in this series.

Barring spoilers despite it's age, the dark mission of 43 has to be my favourite. I feel this mission had the most impact despite being rather short. It reminds me of my first playthrough of MW2 with Ghost and Roach.",1690906506,1690906506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't have fun if there is no way to die other than let the enemy shot me to death. Not only that there is too much cutscene that go on for so long. If you like metal gear it will still be fun. But I had no fun with it. In the older ones I die if I get spotted, so I have to hide to survive. I don't get that here with health regenerate. Without the healing items with the health bar that limit the player to hide and find a way to sneak pass without alerting the enemies, its not hard for me. If you love the metal gear you may like this or not depending if you fine with health regenerate.

While after playing 100 hours in this game. It's not bad. But not Metal Gear. What do I mean by that well. It's really fun with boring thing's around it. The best part is the open world stealth with missions to get S rank is 100% no detection and no kills. The worse parts are the base building and R&D. The story lose no points because it's still good along with the missions and open world. But the side stuff of where you have to stop to do some other things while rushing to get an S rank with a time limit that will effect your ranking in the mission. Can be more annoying then just focus on stealth. Also there is no Bosses that feel good to fight. None. There are bosses but not as good as MGS1, MGS2, MGS3, or MSG4. It feels like a good game with so much around it that makes me want to stop playing even though it's really fun.

From its gripping prologue to its mind-bending end, MGSV is a wild roller-coaster ride of espionage, action, and strategy. The rich narrative and world building kept me hooked from start to finish, and the complex gameplay mechanics provided a challenging but rewarding experience.

A highlight of my experience was undoubtedly the base-building aspect. There's something immensely satisfying about seeing your Mother Base grow from a solitary platform into a bustling fortress, soldier by soldier. The attention to detail Kojima Productions put into this feature is astounding, making each recruit feel important and each upgrade meaningful.

Perhaps the greatest strength of MGSV lies in its freedom of approach. Every mission, every outpost, every boss fight can be tackled in countless different ways. Whether you prefer the Rambo-esque guns blazing style or the classic stealthy approach, this game allows you to tackle obstacles in the way that suits you best. Every playstyle is viable and, in many cases, encouraged.

The game's visuals still hold up well, with great animations and environment design. The soundtrack is an eclectic mix of 80's hits and sweeping orchestral scores that perfectly encapsulate the essence of the game.

The Phantom Pain isn't without its flaws, however. Some may find the pacing of the story uneven, and the micromanagement of your base can get a bit tedious at times. But these minor gripes do little to diminish the overall quality of the game.

In conclusion, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an unforgettable journey packed full of cinematic storytelling, stealth-action gameplay, and strategic base management. After investing 186 hours, I can say without a doubt, it's an adventure that's worth every minute. Whether you're a series veteran or a newcomer to the franchise, don't miss out on this gem.

Quite a rare type of game these days. Even the open world isn't a bad thing here, as it allows to approach mission objectives in different ways. Needless to say, the story is deep and gripping (special thanks to those magnificent single-shot cutscenes).

One of the biggest flaws of the MGS V is its second chapter. Don't get me wrong, in terms of story it's still impressive. But there are problems with the structure. To get to the true ending, you have to replay some of the missions that you encountered at the beginning.

The one thing that kept me from ever playing this game again was the increasing emptiness of the plot once you're roughly halfway through. Missions become repetitive and grindy so you can get the next cutscene that advances the story, only the story rather abruptly ends without any sort of conclusion, as if there was whole third of the story missing and so I was left feeling like I had just played a padded out demo of what could have been something much more fleshed out.

Also, while many people (myself included) were anticipating the return of David Hayter's voice as Big Boss, Kiefer Sutherland was far from the worst choice.

MGS V is well put together and sufficiently polished to be a great game on its own, but the lack of an engaging plot or even a consistently paced one at that makes it very difficult for me to recommend despite its strong points.",1690632793,1690632793,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well ... No.

Great game mechanics at it's heart.

But...

So many terrible things, it just doesn't live up to the hype.

Now, I'm reviewing this a LONG time after it's release. But even if it was a good game when it was released, it was NEVER a great game.

1.) weird 'suspension of disbelief' breaking game mechanics:
e.g.
  - chicken hat
  - repetition of maps
  - crappy (console) checkpoint saving that re-loads you in weird states where enemies are refreshed but ammo isn't
  - weird supernatural story that breaks away from hyper-realistic stealth war game
  - weird story that never gets explained or resolved properly
  - chapter 2 that isn't a new chapter at all - just chapter 1 repeated at higher difficulty ffs

So - great game mechanics at it's heart that could have made a truly great game - ruined by this weird console kiddies game play and weird Japanese story-telling sensibility where nothing makes sense or needs explaining!

Just in case you were wondering - the game ends at the end of Chapter 1 - and Chapter 2 is just a blatant LIE to keep you playing for longer - repeating Chapter 1. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DEVELOPER WAS THINKING! They didn't earn any more money keeping me playing the single player game under false pretenses. So why do it?

Seriously, what kind of braindead idiot thought that it was a good idea to include grinding in a Metal Gear game? And why do I need to play the older missions all over again with increased difficulty in order to progress in the main story? It's like they have done everything they could to ensure that players don't have fun. Most of my playtime consists of having to replay the same mission for the billionth time due to scarcely placed checkpoints or getting one shot out of nowhere. Even the Satan himself couldn't think of hiding the ending of the game behind boring and unfairly difficult replays. The developers disrespect the players' times by artificially extending the playtime like this. They would probably sell their own asses if they knew that it would increase the playtime even more. 
Just play Peace Walker if you want to connect the gap in Big Boss' story between MGS 3: Snake Eater and Metal Gear 1. It has much worse gameplay and is also a bit grindy but at least has actual content rather than recycling maps, missions, and cutscenes through the whole game.
Selling Ground Zeroes with two-third of a full game's price on release was already a low move considering that it only included a single level that could be completed easily in 30 minutes, but they managed to go even lower with this incomplete mess.

One of the greatest games ever made and possibly the best stealth game of all time. The depth of gameplay is unlike anything else I've ever seen, and you will not get tired of pushing the limits of what you can do with it. Its story is marvelous despite what anyone might tell you. Kojima's best writing and definitely the best acting of the series. 

Deeply moving and shocking by turns, an incredible examinations of what truths, values, and relationships we hold dear, and how quickly both of these things can turn on us and we can turn on them when adverse circumstances arise. It touches on how we can slowly, almost imperceptibly, become the villains of the story, and how war and political strife harm people and corrupt them. It refuses to compromise with simple outlooks to complicated situations. For the most part it doesn't preach, but lets you, the player, draw your own conclusions by acting out the story  yourself. It examines how perception of an individual can outgrow him or her, and that by the time a person has penetrated public consciousness, they themselves are far less important than what they represent. Big Boss is not an individual here, but an idea. And you get to be that idea. 

Without giving away spoilers, this game will present you with scenarios that challenge your perception. You may feel surprised, confused, or even betrayed (I felt that way at first), but these challenging ideas can be the mark of the best types of fiction.

Pros:
1. Great albeit confusing story - for a newcomer to the franchise
2. Tons of missions and side ops, tons of replay value
3. Great buddies for all occasions
4. Suspense, horror, action, stealth, melodrama como una telenovela, some pervy moments a la Kojima Productions

Cons:
1. Bad PC controls port (no mouse scroll support, incorrect key prompts)
2. Confusing UI and deep menu nesting, horrendous staff management system
3. 1&2 make critical actions like calling chopper/supply drop so annoyingly slow
4. Secondary mission objectives are disclosed after you completed the primary ones, and that requires you to strategise on the spot within the enemy zone, often under vulnerable circumstances
5. Certain missions are rather unhinged in terms of how much of a pain in the ass they are
6. Weapons aren't that customisable
7. Forced FOB (you can go offline to avoid FOB missions but your resources can still be stolen over time)",1686192497,1690040697,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

idk what happened in the universe of this series, but that's not an issue because Kojima really explains and guides what happened there.
In my opinion, this game is excellent in every category story, gameplay, sound design, and character design but some features, like dispatch and develop, require a lot of time and resources that be problem if you don have much time.
Last side mission was so boringly repetitious.

The game is about 85% complete and you'll notice the holes.  Few inside rooms in Mother Base, a limited inventory of large military grade hardware, as well as (optional) micro-transactions.  The music is also lacking.  But the game is worth it.  And it's fun.  Especially late game and starting over with god powers.  Hopefully MGS 6 will finish the cliffhanger ending.

Everything that could be said about this story has already been said, that being that it pissed everyone the fuck off upon release and then in retrospect it's either the worst piece of shit ever or a misunderstood work of art that was rushed because the pachinko corporation didn't let the man who already wasted 80 billion and half a decade continue making a story that could never ever have turned out good anyways if it was still just this story with some additional touches here and there because it's so absurdly broken. It's very easy to draw a conclusion that something was [i]missing[/i], especially regarding that reveal and Mission 51, but this was also a problem with Peace Walker dropping a sudden plot reveal on you at the end after it stopped being an actual, continuous story, with almost no clear transition to it, so I think it's more of an issue with the production team being unable to write a coherent story with the episodic mission format. TL;DR I think the story is just bad, even if it got 10 more years in the oven, it would still have been pretty awful if it was this exact story with some added details or coherence here and there, and outside of the abrupt reveal given no context and the cut Mission 51 (which is awful anyways and only really wraps up one side plot) there's really nothing in the game to indicate that the story is actually ""unfinished"" because where else would you even go from there? Every hanging plot thread feel designed to draw you to a resolution given in a previous game, which I think is intentional given that the main story ends with the big timeline just effectively recapping the entire series for you.
The gameplay is really the biggest misstep here because it allows for so much creativity and experimentation, and yet encourages none of those because the most effective method is just to tranq and fulton enemies - a problem that goes back to Peace Walker with the fulton specifically, which really just made a problem that came all the way from MGS2 worse. You are never punished for it, and when you look at it from a very reductive standpoint it's just pushing you towards this very limiting gameplay style while also hanging over you 10 billion fatal weapons that would make the game so much more fun and cool and yet it punishes you for that because:
1. You're putting a hole in the skull of a soldier who could level up Mother Base
2. Corpses are harder to dispose of than a balloon to the sky, thus making your own stealth harder
This could all be part of some amazing esoteric metanarrative about how your character is supposed to be a hero which is obviously intentional to some degree given the horrible immersion-breaking inclusion of Demon Snake and Heroism points, but putting aside how distracting it is to think about the fact that you're supposed to be collecting good boy points in the game closest to Metal Gear 1 where you play as Big Boss, this is still an obvious and painful flaw from a game design standpoint, made even worse by the fact that it's haunted the series for a good 14 years by the time this game came out and that this game sells itself so hard on being ""a new breed of stealth"". Everything is trivialized, and the one infamous mission where the game does punish you for trying to fulton everything away (and it's a side objective there!) just punishes you for everything in general. It really is wasted potential, because you have to actively play against the most rewarding playstyle to have the fun and innovative experience that's very sadly hidden away.
This game is forever haunted by the phantom of the breakup between Konami and the game director, so now any good thing is now a single auteur's genius mind projecting an entire video game onto reality, and any bad thing is now the horrible evil Japanese game company's fault for getting in the way of this auteur's genius. The worst consequence from this breakup is making the dedicated cult who'd lick at the footsteps of the man who directed MGS4 completely invincible despite how much he'll credit himself for being the man who made this game in every unskippable minute-long credit sequence so much so that you'd really think he thought this game into existence. And of course Konami is evil, don't get me wrong, we know for a fact what they did towards the end of this game's development and I'm aware that would have caused production issues. But if you were just some normal ass person who didn't use the internet or whatever and wasn't aware of who the fuck any of these directors or companies were and just liked MGS and played this game in the way that it points you to, it'd be just... whatever. The missed potential is more obvious than the average MGS game's subtlety, but it's not a blatantly unfinished product because it really is not. But I suppose that wasted potential is part of the epic phantom pain theme and metanarrative, which is somehow supposed to be perfectly executed despite the same argument telling me the game is unfinished and that the evil corpo got in the way.

As a long-time fan of the series, I can confidently say that it stands as one of the greatest entries in the Metal Gear Solid franchise; by the way it's not my first time playing it.

The game's narrative immediately grabs your attention with its complex and thought-provoking storyline. Following the journey of Venom Snake and his pursuit of revenge in a world of political intrigue, I found myself fully engrossed in the game's attention to detail and seamless integration of cinematic cutscenes and interactive gameplay. It truly made me feel like an integral part of the narrative.

The gameplay mechanics in Metal Gear Solid V are a testament to its excellence. The open-world design allows for unprecedented freedom, offering multiple approaches to every mission. Whether you prefer stealth and subtlety or a more action-oriented playstyle, the game accommodates your personal preferences. The dynamic AI and enemy patrols add an extra layer of challenge, making each mission a thrilling and strategic endeavor.

The development of Mother Base, where you build and expand your private army, adds depth and customization. Managing resources, recruiting personnel, and researching new technologies not only provides in-game benefits but also fosters a sense of ownership and investment in your own military organization.

Visually, Metal Gear Solid V is a stunning masterpiece. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and animations is breathtaking. Whether traversing open landscapes or infiltrating enemy bases, the game's graphical fidelity never fails to impress.

The sound design and music deserve special mention. The haunting melodies and atmospheric tracks perfectly complement the game's atmosphere, enhancing the tension and emotional impact of key moments.

While the game's narrative may feel incomplete at times due to its development circumstances(well that depend, overall from my point of view it's really complete, presenting the past and what will happen after, some characters are not developed but we have a lot of answers) , this does not diminish the overall quality of the experience. Metal Gear Solid V still delivers an unforgettable journey filled with twists, turns, and memorable characters.

On a side note, Steam achievements can be challenging, and managing the base and FOB missions can be overwhelming at times. The online timer for upgrades, which seems to push towards microtransactions, can be a point of frustration. However, it does not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.

In conclusion, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a triumph in the world of gaming. Its engaging storytelling, innovative gameplay, and technical prowess make it an essential title for any fan of the series or the stealth-action genre as a whole. Despite minor drawbacks, the game offers an exceptional adventure that allows players to embody a legendary soldier in a world on the brink of chaos.",1689008053,1689329946,True,21,0,0.673219561576843262,2,True,False,False

This game took me on a wild ride filled with laughter, absurdity, and a whole lot of cardboard boxes. It's like Hideo Kojima decided to inject the game with a dose of pure comedic genius, and I couldn't stop laughing my way through this wacky espionage adventure.

First things first, let's talk about the protagonist, Big Boss, a man who takes stealth to a whole new level. Not only does he have an arsenal of weapons and gadgets at his disposal, but he also knows how to rock a mullet like nobody's business. I mean, who needs a stealth suit when you have a hairstyle that distracts enemies? Big Boss might as well be a walking disco ball!

Now, let's not forget about our trusty sidekick, Ocelot. This guy is like the James Bond of the Metal Gear universe, but with an obsession for spinning revolvers and a penchant for dramatic monologues. I swear, every time he appeared on screen, I couldn't help but chuckle at his over-the-top theatrics. I half expected him to break into a song and dance routine at any moment!

And speaking of over-the-top, let's talk about the game's villains. Metal Gear 5: The Phantom's Pain introduces us to a cast of eccentric bad guys that would make any Bond villain green with envy. We have a fire-spewing maniac who thinks he's a god, a guy with a metal arm who can summon lightning, and a quiet sniper who can disappear faster than my will to exercise. I couldn't decide if I should be terrified or laughing uncontrollably every time they made an appearance.

But perhaps the greatest source of hilarity in this game is the cardboard box. Yes, you heard me right, a plain old cardboard box. It's not just any box, though. This magical contraption is like a Swiss army knife of absurdity. Need to hide from enemies? Use the box. Need to travel across the map undetected? Just hop on the box and roll your way to victory. I can't count how many times I burst into laughter as I witnessed Big Boss engaging in intense cardboard box shenanigans.

Metal Gear 5: The Phantom's Pain is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's precisely why it's so much fun. It embraces the ridiculousness of its world and characters, delivering a hilarious experience from start to finish. If you're looking for a game that will keep you entertained and laughing, then grab a box, put on your best mullet, and dive headfirst into this madcap adventure. Just be prepared for your sides to ache from laughter and your face to hurt from smiling. This game is an absolute riot!",1640828793,1689297115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With stunning scenery, Metal Gear V begins by enchanting us in Kojima style, and then gives way to many hours of gameplay. The end? ... incredible.
The approach to the various missions is incredibly varied (positive aspect) tending slightly more to the firefight than the almost pure stealth of the previous chapters (positive/negative aspect to your liking).
It is difficult to explain the sentimental connection with this saga, but the fans who have played the previous Metal Gear know what I mean.
Maybe this isn't the best chapter of the saga (for me it isn't) but it's still a beautiful game that explains to fans some unanswered questions, and that gives you thrills of pure emotion. I highly recommend playing at least metal gear solid 3 before this game to get an idea of ​​some of the topics covered, but much more you will not be able to understand and experience it without having played the entire saga. I believe it is essential to have played the whole saga to enjoy metal gear V at 100%[I think it is better to play the chapters of the saga in the order in which they were created, but it will be more difficult (and nice) to understand the plot as it is not the chronological order of events (chapters)].
P.s. if Kojima had had some more time, we would have had an even richer, more dynamic and more shocking game than it already is, but unfortunately we know that is a bit incomplete in the end... sorry but I had to write it.

I first discovered Hideo Kojima not with Metal Gear, but with Death Stranding, and I loved every single second of it. I loved the immersive world built up around me, the oddly unfitting but still fascinating characters, the absolutely BONKERS names that the game came up with for... absolutely everyone, and some absolutely GORGEOUS visuals. Seriously, Kojima games are just straight eye candy no matter the generation.

So, once I figured out that the Metal Gear franchise was basically Kojima's magnum opus, I decided yeah, I'll give it a shot. I got the disk, popped it into my PS4, and lost hundreds of hours to Afghanistan and the Diamond Dogs. Just like Death Stranding, I loved every single second of Metal Gear Solid V, enough for me to buy it a second time on Steam - and I don't regret that! I still enjoy playing it even now.

However, there is one glaring problem that I only found with the benefit of hindsight: MGSV REEKS of cut content.

There are so many ideas that are STARTED, but never finished by the end of the game. Here's just a small example: you can extract a Pashto interpreter, which makes a lot of sense since, yknow, Pashto is a major language of the Afghan peoples. What happens when you extract him? Nothing! There is not a single mission in the ENTIRE GAME that makes use of his language translation skills! There is not a single instance where this proves to be even remotely useful - and that's just one such example of absolute wasted potential. This was an idea that absolutely could've been fleshed out, but just wasn't.

I don't really know whose fault it is that XYZ got cut, but here's the thing: if you're going to remove content for A N Y reason, at the very least you need to be subtle about it. Shadow of the Colossus has loads of cut bosses, some of which never even left the drawing board, and that's completely fine! SOTC is just as good of a game with 16 bosses as it would've been (in my opinion) with 24. The problem is that the content of MGSV isn't ""cut,"" it's completely ripped out, with all of the nasty tearing and scars left behind to show for it. You can SEE where there was supposed to be something really cool, but had to be axed to meet a deadline or something.

The absolute tragedy of MGSV is that the premise is absolutely a w e s o m e. With the benefit of hindsight, and having played some more MGS titles (specifically Snake Eater and Peace Walker, which I believe directly prequel this one), I can absolutely see what Hideo was shooting for - and that makes the execution just heartbreaking. Memorable characters, some absolutely S-Tier garbage oneliners, incredible thematic premise, stunning visuals, and gripping character interactions. You can find husks of these diamons scattered across Kabul. Metal Gear Solid V is by no means a bad game, but its potential was squandered, whether that be by Kojima, Konami, or both.

If there was some director's cut with EVERYTHING packed back into the game, I would buy it in a heartbeat. But this is not that completed vision. I can recommend it for some good gameplay - but that is as far as I would go. MGSV is far from a masterpiece.",1689088826,1689088826,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

» [b]Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain[/b] is an exceptional game that stands as a shining gem in the gaming industry. Developed by [i]Kojima Productions[/i] and [i]Konami[/i], this stealth-action game is a culmination of Hideo Kojima’s visionary storytelling and groundbreaking gameplay mechanics. Although released in 2015, it continues the legacy of the Metal Gear series and pushes the boundaries of what a video game can achieve.

[h1]Gameplay and Environment[/h1]
» One of the standout features of The Phantom Pain is its gameplay mechanics. The game offers an open-world environment, allowing endless exploration of vast landscapes and tackling missions with unparalleled freedom. Whether it be infiltrating enemy bases to rescuing prisoners, the game presents players with a myriad of possibilities. The combination of stealth, tactical espionage, and action-packed combat creates an immersive and thrilling experience for newcomers.

From complex level designs to realistic physics and weather effects, it truly showcases the sheer dedication that Kojima put into his creation. The day-night cycle and dynamic weather system not only add realism but also influence the behavior of enemies and alter mission objectives. This level of immersion truly sets Metal Gear Solid V apart from its peers. What’s more, this game also features an intelligent and adaptive AI system. Enemies respond realistically to the player’s actions, adapting their tactics and increasing the challenge as the game progresses. This aspect adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, forcing players to think strategically and adapt their approaches accordingly. It rewards creativity and encourages experimentation, ensuring that no two playthroughs feel the same.

[h1]Story[/h1]
» The narrative of Metal Gear Solid V is another aspect that sets it apart. Hideo Kojima's signature storytelling shines through, weaving a complex and thought-provoking tale of war, revenge, and the human condition. The game tackles mature themes and presents morally ambiguous choices, which question the consequences of actions. This is supported by a strong cast of characters, each with their own motivations and backstories, adding depth and emotional resonance to the experience. Kiefer Sutherland's performance as Venom Snake brings a new perspective to the protagonist while supporting characters like Ocelot and Quiet offer compelling dynamics that enrich the overall experience. The game’s presentation is top-notch, with stunning visuals and a cinematic flair that rivals major motion pictures. The attention to detail in character models, environments, and animations is simply remarkable. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
» As the series finale, Metal Gear Solid V leaves a lasting impact on both the franchise and the gaming industry as a whole. It is a must-play for fans of the series and anyone seeking an unforgettable experience.

Hideo Kojima and his team at Kojima Productions have crafted a remarkable gaming experience that combines gripping storytelling, intricate gameplay mechanics, and a level of player freedom rarely seen in the genre.

From the very beginning, The Phantom Pain grabs hold of your attention with its engrossing narrative. Set during the tumultuous events of the Cold War, you assume the role of Venom Snake, a legendary soldier seeking revenge against those who have wronged him. The story is a captivating web of political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and unexpected twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your journey.

The gameplay mechanics in The Phantom Pain are a true highlight of the game. From infiltration to sabotage, every mission can be approached with a myriad of strategies and approaches. The open-world environments offer unprecedented freedom, allowing players to employ stealth, combat, or a combination of both to accomplish their objectives. The level of player agency and the wide array of tools and gadgets at your disposal make each mission feel like a personalized experience tailored to your playstyle.

One of the defining aspects of Metal Gear Solid V is its remarkable attention to detail. The game world is meticulously crafted, with sprawling environments that feel alive and brimming with activity. From the smallest blades of grass to the grandest structures, every aspect of the world exudes a sense of realism and immersion. The day-night cycle, weather effects, and the dynamic AI behavior all contribute to an ever-evolving world that responds to your actions and decisions.

The companion system adds depth and complexity to the gameplay. Recruiting and deploying a team of specialists with unique skills and abilities brings an additional layer of strategy to each mission. Whether it's the deadly sniper Quiet, the support-focused D-Dog, or the versatile D-Horse, your chosen companions provide invaluable assistance and enhance your tactical options.

The Phantom Pain also boasts a robust multiplayer component called Metal Gear Online. This competitive mode allows players to engage in tactical team-based battles, employing their skills, gadgets, and stealth to outwit and outmaneuver opponents. The seamless integration of the multiplayer experience adds longevity and replayability to the game, ensuring that the fun doesn't end with the single-player campaign.

Visually, The Phantom Pain is a visual marvel. The attention to detail in character models, animations, and environments is exceptional. The game's graphics engine delivers stunning vistas, realistic lighting, and impressive weather effects that immerse you in its world. Combined with the outstanding voice acting and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, the audio-visual presentation elevates the overall experience to new heights.

In conclusion, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a masterpiece of the tactical espionage action genre. With its captivating storyline, open-world freedom, intricate gameplay mechanics, and exceptional attention to detail, it stands as a testament to Hideo Kojima's visionary craftsmanship. If you're a fan of stealth-action games or simply appreciate a well-crafted and immersive gaming experience, The Phantom Pain is an absolute must-play.

None other than a trusty cardboard box, the ultimate fashion statement in the world of espionage. Whether you are infiltrating a secret base or simply want to confuse your enemies, this game grants you the power to don a cardboard disguise that would make even the most seasoned cat burglar jealous.

The gameplay, which is as sick as it gets. The stealth mechanics are smooth and intuitive, allowing you to effortlessly move through levels undetected or silently take down enemies. With a vast array of gadgets and weapons at your disposal, the possibilities are endless. From tranquilizer darts to smoke grenades, you can approach each mission with creativity and finesse.

Just give your buddy a call, and he will guide you through it like a pro.

I can't recommend this game if you're expecting a story rich ""old-school MGS"" with mind blowing twists and colorful characters. It is quite sad that a game like this would end up being so average on this side because of the conflictions between Kojima and Konami. Also FOB or online system is b******t which gave me a nightmareish mobile gamelike experience. Attack other Mother Bases? What the f*** is this, Clash of Clans?

Overall, I think I mostly had a good time playing The Phantom Pain. I can forgive both Konami and Kojima, if we can get remasters of old MGS classics.

The holy grail of world-building games, it’s argued, is a black box that lets players do as they like with minimal handholding. Pliability with just the right measure of accountability. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, a tactical stealth simulation wrapped in a colossal resource management puzzle inside a love letter to theatrical inscrutability, comes the closest of any game I’ve yet played to realizing that ideal.

That probably sounds a little backwards if you’re hip to Hideo Kojima’s long running Metal Gear Solid series, which launched in 1987 on a Japanese computer platform. We laud Kojima for his contributions to stealth gaming’s grammar, but he’s also loved and, by some, lampooned, for bouts of indulgent auteurism. A self-professed cinephile (he told me in 2014 that he tries to watch a movie a day), he’s notorious for straining attention spans with marathon film-style interludes and epic denouements. His last numbered Metal Gear Solid game, Guns of the Patriots, holds two Guinness records, one for the longest cutscene in a game (27 minutes), another for the longest cutscene sequence (71 minutes). A fan-edited compendium of the latter’s combined non-interactive sequences clocks in at upwards of nine hours.

So it feels a little weird to declare The Phantom Pain comparably cutscene-free. Oh they’re still here, as fascinating, offbeat and abstruse as ever, but restricted to momentary exposition instead of Homeric interruption. It’s like some other mirror-verse version of Kojima helmed production, suddenly obsessed with play-driven storytelling, while most of the grim narrative about the descent of a Melvillian mercenary trickles in through cassette tapes you can listen to at leisure, or ignore completely.

That turnabout pays dividends. We’re instead treated to a clandestine feast of open world prowling, an unparalleled tactical toybox staged in sprawling bulwarks bristling with eerily sentient enemies. You play as Big Boss, the grizzled, cyclopean soldier of fortune we spent so much of the series reviling, traumatized and left comatose by events in last year’s prologue and prolegomena, Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes. The Phantom Pain is the revenge fantasy entrée transpiring nine years later, a grab-your-bootstraps offshore empire-building exercise and parallel slide into militaristic perdition by way of the Soviet-Afghan and Angolan (civil) wars circa 1984. It’s a Cold War paranoiac’s paradise.

The idea, first articulated in 2010’s Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, is that you’re leading a private nation-agnostic military force from your “mother base,” a concrete and steel-jacketed platform anchored in the middle of the Indian Ocean near the Seychelles archipelago. From there, you execute contracts for shadowy clients in fictional swathes of Afghanistan and the African Angola-Zaire border region, accruing capital to unlock an arsenal of espionage munitions, all the while sleuthing for intelligence on the sinister outfit that brought you to ruin nearly a decade ago.

You’d think a game about private mercenaries would entail managing squadrons of them, and The Phantom Pain does eventually unlock a meta game where, wielding an anachronistic wireless handheld drolly dubbed an “iDroid,” you can deploy groups of soldiers to conflict zones based on probabilistic projections. But this is Big Boss’s story, and the lion’s share plants you in his boots, embarking on missions framed like TV episodes, infiltrating then exfiltrating enemy compounds, mountain fortresses and repurposed ancient citadels to extract some piece of intel, rescue a skilled soldier or assassinate whatever operative. It’s during those tense, punishing, exquisitely crafted sorties that the experience shifts from glorified hide-and-seekery to sublime subterfuge.

Consider just a few of the ways Kojima lets you poke his anthills. Like how to approach a cliffside fortress teeming with floodlights, security cameras, anti-aircraft cannons, machine gun nests, barbed wire fences, lookout posts, labyrinthine caverns, hovering gunships, weaponized bipedal robots and playgrounds of scalable, multilevel mud-rock dwellings staffed by relentless, hyperaware soldiers. From what angle? At sunrise or sunset? After thorough or slapdash surveillance? In what sort of camouflage? With the aid of a horse for quick arrival and escape, or a canine pal that can spot and mark enemies faster and more completely than you?

Should you wait for a stray sandstorm to blow through, occluding visibility and making direct approaches (or escapes) tenable? Buzz HQ to chopper in a rocket launcher so you can take out an enemy gunship while it’s still on the helipad? Scout for unguarded power hubs to kill lights and cameras (at the expense of raising guard alert levels)? Detonate communications equipment to disrupt radio chatter between field operatives and HQ? Should you slink across a dangerously unconcealed bridge to save time, or clamber down a rocky bluff, scurry across the basin below, then inch up half a dozen flights of steel-cage stairs to pop out at the bridge’s far side? Are you the turtle or the hare?

But it’s the game’s ruthless artificial intelligence that ties it all together so superbly. The Phantom Pain sports the most unpredictable, exploitation-resistant opponents we’ve seen in a sandbox game. Though they run through all the classic Metal Gear-ish paranoia loops, they’re capable of far grander collaboration and topographical awareness. If alerted, they’ll swarm your last known position, then spread out to probe logical escape routes. Favor night ops and they’ll don night vision goggles. Favor headshots and they’ll start wearing metal helmets. It’s as impressive, in its way, as Monolith’s Nemesis system in last year’s Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, turning indelibility into tactical iteration.

In the background sits your mother base, visually emblematic of Kojima’s fondness for pumpkin-orange containers and pipe-strung sidewalls, everything smooth and orthogonal and gleaming—the Jony Ive of offshore platform design. Once you’re using the Fulton recovery system, an intentionally silly balloon-driven means of quick-firing anything (enemies, weapons, animals and more) you find in the field back to base, you’ll spend hours here developing new weapons, fiddling with staff assignments and snapping on new platforms. Once you grok how battlefield bric-a-brac feeds into base growth, mission difficulty trebles, as you’re incentivized during assignments to track the best-rated foes and gear.

The game has its share of head-scratchers, like why enemies tagged on your radar stay marked when restarting a mission (convenient, but immersion-killing), or why it takes so much work to unlock the game’s notion of a fast travel system. I’m also conflicted about the buddy system: I wound up abandoning my wolf companion because he made the surveillance game too easy.

Loping across The Phantom Pain‘s hardscrabble Afghani-scapes, lighting on soldiers bantering about communism and capitalism, playing tapes of cohorts waxing philosophic about Salt II, Soviet scorched earth policies and African civil wars, questioning who I’m supposed to be—sporting metaphorical horn and tail, both hero and villain—all I know is that I’m going to miss the defiance, the daring, the controversy, the contradictions.",1686084147,1687993746,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Done? Okay, let's proceed.

Let's start with plot. The story is okay, I guess, but rife with inconsistencies. Decades before Metal Gear Solid, where cutting edge technology looked like a grainy green video call screen, apparently we had 3D holographic GPS screen projection technology, where intel can be downloaded to computer chips in your suit, but you still need to use cassette tapes to listen to mission briefings...? Humanoid megatron mech versions of Metal Gear in a game set 30 years before Rex, that looked and moved like a constipated school. I mean, come on...

MGS has always been sort of an alternate history genre, at least since we all aged into the then futuristic sounding ""2005"" in which the original was set, so you can forgive a certain degree of technological inconsistency, but it's tough to ignore the main character having a perfectly functioning robot arm with built-in rocket punch and sonar functionality in context to a franchise where the most advanced tech decades later was a 2 dimensional radar consisting of pulsing dots and goes offline when the enemy gets angry.

I think most people know what the big twist is in the story, but I won't spoil it just in case you haven't. Suffice to say, it's stupid. Like, really stupid, and undermines any meaning you found in the rest of the game. The main character is stuck in this limbo between the blank canvas self insert protagonist you often see in RPGs, and an independent personality such you would normally find in story-driven games like MGS. This results in a weirdly mute person to whom the story keeps happening without any reaction, interspersed with jarring moments where he suddenly becomes real and makes decisions. Pick a lane.

In terms of mechanics, the game is largely superior to previous titles, with companions and air support, although I found myself aching to do dive rolls outside of when going downhill, rather than the dive and bellyflop button they gave you. Don't get me wrong, I like that, too. It's satisfying to dive behind cover. But rolling has been an integral part of this franchise, and you really feel its absence. It seems to me they could have simply made it so if you press square a second time while diving, you land in a roll. Who would that have hurt? 

There are vastly more features and tools available than previous titles, although ironically you are far more limited in how many of the 18 billion available weapons you can carry with you on any mission. So you end up picking two favourites and just only using them, never really exploring the alternatives because if you end up liking them. You can't keep ordering supply drops because you want to use weapons uniquely suited to different purposes. The unrealistic infinite backback was preferable.

On the subject of realism, I found in-game timing to be irritating. Before I continue please wait 45 seconds while I sit in a bloody helicopter doing nothing, like you have to do before EVERY MISSION.

A lot of the missions have, like, a 3 day limit to complete them, but the days last like half an hour. It's a STEALTH GAME. Taking your time, setting traps, crawling slowly through tall grass. I don't need unrealistic timers counting down during that. Meanwhile every time you open your hologram menu you have to wait for realistic 80's dial-up loading times to switch between tabs. What moron put that in? I don't want to be so immersed that I have to wait for an imaginary screen to buffer, especially in a game where a month passes if I leave it running while I go make a bloody sandwich. 

The companion mechanic was a nice addition, although the dog, as goodest boy as he is, constantly standing inbetween your legs every time you try to kick-start an unconscious soldier so you kick him instead was just stupid. The other companions are either virtually useless or so overpowered they can basically play the game for you. I didn't use them much.

The last thing of note would be Motherbase. I liked the idea of having your own base that you could slowly build or add to, and having them sort of battle against other player's bases was an amazing idea... on paper. In reality, there is basically no customization you can do to your base, and nothing really to do there but shower and parkour. The MMO-style PVP they tried to add where you invade each other's bases seems nice in principle, but in reality it's boring and accomplishes nothing meaningful.

Overall I think it was good. There is SO much replayability in this because you can just keep recapturing and losing outposts forever, some side quests are redoable, kidnapping staff is satisfying until you have everything maxed, even if it is a bit logically dubious. There's a lot to enjoy here. Just not the story, characters, many mechanics or the central premise of the game. I would have liked to see an ACTUAL MGS game made with this style and quality, but instead it's more like bad fan fic built around a plot twist that is unsatisfying and doesn't really make sense. Again, I won't ruin it, but when you find out, it's like you have not been playing MGS, and you feel cheated.

It's a good game, it's just not the game we deserved.

Trouble is, this game is 8 years old, and all those things (and so much more) have been talked about in painstaking detail. So, I'll just say this:

If you enjoy heavily immersive action adventure stealth games that basically give you free reign to play as you please, you will enjoy this game.
If you enjoy the Metal Gear franchise, you will mostly enjoy this game.
If you've been living under a rock and this is your first experience with Konami and are expecting great things in the future, God help you...and you will enjoy this game.

Chapter 2 is a joke, mostly replays of missions from the chapter 1, with story elements that contradict whatever happened before.

This game still offers the most replay-value of any other games these days. The research tree is just incredible.

The details in the graphics are superb, also in the environment, the NPCs reactions, the different ways you can change to outcome of any encounter, any mission, it is extraordinary. The controls, the map, the options, everything you need is there, or will come later in the game, and works great. There is always something new to discover, to learn, to use, etc!

Phantom Pain is often regarded as an entry that keeps its head held high despite the behind the scenes nonsense that forced the series creator Hideo Kojima to be axed, forfeiting his ownership of the IP. Yeah, yeah, this is a review, but I always open most reviews with things that should be brought up. But what does Phantom Pain do that makes it stand tall? It's a complete reinvention of the series mainstays that fans and first timers will adore, stealth is now at its best, combat is challenging but rewarding even if it's the most intense it's ever been, at least for me. But I can't deny how obnoxious the monetization and live service features are, they are so heavily integrated into the game that it make the experience repetitive real quick. Even with my almost 50hrs of playtime I acknowledge how dry it can get, especially with a lot of cookie cutter mission structures that, yes, *can* be fun but once you've played missions that start to stink of this repetition you may also begin to drag your feet a little. But even then, this game still has the Kojima charm that I just can't fault. It's so absurdly Japanese that it's intoxicating, and it really makes me feel grateful that Kojima can still work in an industry that's mistreated him.

the gameplay, as previously stated is both accessible and deep--new players are granted features such as Reflex mode, a slo mo reaction to being seen by an enemy. eliminating or subduing them during such period will prevent a full alert and still allow you an S rank as well. this feature is also appreciated by veterans like me, who had to contend with an outdated control scheme and no such feature while playing the earliest entries, this will make each mission much less frustrating and time consuming. the classic Kojima levels of detail are present and are best outlined in one of a few steam guides on the topic, but an easy example is the length of time enemies are knocked out for: a tranquilizer to the head will knock them out for longer than CQC throw move, stuff like that. managing your base includes assigning staff to the right department (something that happens automatically but is necessary to check once and a while), developing new weapons and field equipment that can vastly change your playstyle, and checking in on the online components, something i'll touch on later.

the sounds are good, with a particularly good licensed soundtrack that reinforces the mid-80s setting of the game; expect to hear stuff like ""Take On Me"". ""Kids in America"", and the like. A particular focus is granted to a Midge Ure cover of David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold the World"" which calls out key themes in the story. you can also 'attach' a song to your helicopter, so that it plays during a pickup or bombardment. A custom soundtrack feature is also present, allowing you to import your own mp3s into the game with the same level of functionality as the base soundtrack. Guns sound properly good, if a little thin IMO but thats probably more true to life. theres a nice level of detail in that the last few rounds of a magazine sound slightly different, as well as the last few rounds a suppressor being able to take also sounding slightly different. if i have one fault is that its generally hard to tell quite how loud your own footsteps are unless you use the specific sonic thing (you probably wont). a feature such as Splinter Cell Chaos Theory's sonic meter would've been appreciated but is not sorely missed here. A great immersion feature, but a possible annoyance as well, is Snake's inability to understand Russian (a key indicator of the stories main twist), Afrikaans, and the other key languages spoken from his enemy soldiers--players will have to find and extract a soldier who can interpret a language to English for Snake to understand,  

as i mentioned earlier, the story is largely easy to ignore. thats because the bulk of it is in taped conversations and briefings from Miller, Ocelot, and similar characters. whats theres is pretty good though. the main cutscenes and pre/post mission audio logs will paint a relatively complete picture of the events and context that Venom Snake, Miller, and Co, go through during the vocal chord viral epidemic and war with Cipher, but the real juicy shit for the longtime fans is a bit buried. those who really wanna know what happened between MGS 3 and 5, as well as those who wish to know every detail about this game's story will have to dig a little but its there. the nice thing is that you can listen to these tapes at your leisure as you see fit. Thematically, those used to the MGS series staples of intelligent, predictive stories and rather deep philosophical ruminations paired with film references and a splash of that buckwild anime spirit will not be disappointed in whats on offer here. MGS5 touches on themes of the importance of communication and spoken language, nuclear disarmament, wartime politics, youth conscription, ethics of vehicular weaponry, morality of war, etc. those in the know with the series will have a more interesting understanding of these characters and how these events largely affect later events in the series. sadly, despite MGS 5 lacks total resolution; instead of the final game in this series, it is yet another chapter.

despite how you feel about Konami ousting Kojima and butchering the next immediate metal gear game (Survive), you gotta give them credit for making sure the MP elements still work as intended almost 10 years later--i can't comment too much on the PvP aspect as i don't spend much time in it (seems interesting but i could never get into it), the singleplayer-augmented features are rather nice. On one hand, you have an ambient and persistent ""fantasy football""-esque set of online battles, which will take place between your Diamond Dogs and other players own PMCs regardless of your involvement, as well as a voluntary, daily version of the same fantasy match-up; competing in either will net you PF points which can be spent on resources, staff, or soldiers and your stats/ability to win is a measurement of what you have developed, how you manage your own mother base, and what other resources you have at your disposal. Your success in these modes determines your PF rank. The other online component of single player is FOB infiltration. once you have access to your own FOB (mission 22 i think), you can infiltrate other players' own FOBs and steal staff and resources from them. This is an asynchronous mode that you can do at any time, but be warned that targeting other players' FOBs opens your own to attack. For those who want less risk but still want to participate, every month or so and going on until the next one, theres an FOB event where you can infiltrate a CPU owned base for FOB Event Points, GMP and other resources, and staff. FOB Points can then be spent on resources, staff, exclusive development projects, base colors, camos, and emblem parts. dont worry if you don't unlock them all, they tend to come back after 2-3 months. PF and Infiltration Ranks are worldwide so you can strive for something there too if you really want.

Where MGS gets fascinating is around 30-40 hours in when you get to mission 30 or so; the game was unfinished from here so you get lots of repeat missions with stricter rulesets and stuff like that instead of new missions. its really not the worst since the missions its repeated are often some of the best stealth missions in gaming but its worth pointing out that this game definitely get repetitive. the story also loses some focus from here as the main villain up to this point has been dealt with and yet the game is hesitating at doing anything new. the result is definitely a game that loses steam and less fun as it goes on but its Kojima levels of depth and detail will still have you learning new little things and hopefully enjoying the experimentation.

tldr; one of, if not the best modern stealth game, hampered by publisher interference and a weak third act as well as a lack of direction to its best mechanics. its a game where you might want to read a few guides to discover some of the crazy cool things you can do. easiest one to point out for myself is do side missions 106-109 (i think? its extract legendary gunsmith, than again, than YET AGAIN) to unlock gun customization.",1686716760,1686716760,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It delivers a gripping narrative, innovative gameplay mechanics, and unparalleled attention to detail, solidifying its place as a modern masterpiece in the gaming industry.

One of the standout aspects of Metal Gear Solid V is its gameplay. The game offers players unprecedented freedom and flexibility in approaching missions and objectives. Whether you prefer stealthy infiltrations, all-out action, or strategic planning, the game caters to your preferred playstyle. The open-world environment of Afghanistan and Africa is meticulously designed, allowing for a multitude of paths, tactics, and approaches to each mission. The sheer depth and complexity of the gameplay mechanics, from utilizing gadgets and weapons to managing a team of skilled operatives, ensure that every mission feels unique and engaging.

The level of immersion in Metal Gear Solid V is unparalleled. The game boasts stunning visuals, realistic environments, and meticulous attention to detail. The day-night cycle, weather effects, and dynamic AI behavior contribute to a truly immersive experience. Additionally, the game's audio design, including the iconic voice acting and atmospheric soundtrack, further enhances the overall immersion, creating an unforgettable atmosphere that draws players into the world of covert operations.

The storyline of Metal Gear Solid V is thought-provoking and emotionally impactful. While the game's narrative can be complex and requires some prior knowledge of the Metal Gear series, it delves into themes of betrayal, revenge, and the moral complexities of warfare. The characters are well-developed, each with their own motivations and conflicts, contributing to a captivating and cinematic experience that keeps players invested from start to finish.

Metal Gear Solid V's online component, Metal Gear Online, offers a robust multiplayer experience. Players can engage in tactical team-based battles, utilizing their stealth skills and cooperative strategies to outmaneuver opponents. The integration of the online mode seamlessly blends with the single-player experience, providing additional longevity and replayability to an already content-rich game.

However, Metal Gear Solid V is not without its minor drawbacks. The narrative, while compelling, is incomplete, leaving some loose ends and unresolved plotlines. Additionally, the game's final act can feel rushed and lacks the same level of polish as the rest of the experience, leading to a somewhat anticlimactic conclusion.

In conclusion, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a true masterpiece in the realm of tactical espionage action games. With its unparalleled gameplay freedom, immersive world, captivating narrative, and unforgettable characters, it stands as a testament to Hideo Kojima's visionary storytelling. Despite its minor flaws, the game offers an unrivaled experience that will keep players engrossed for hours on end. Metal Gear Solid V is a must-play for both fans of the series and newcomers alike, solidifying its place as one of the greatest games of its generation.",1679853070,1686218046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Attention to detail in spite of internal company conflict.

Arguably the best Metal Gear Solid game to have ever existed. 
Independent of the series, it is one of the best games I've ever played to date.

Soviet comms between CP and the deployed soldiers was amazing.
Presence of 3 PFs (Rogue Coyote, Zero Risk Security and Contract Forces of Africa) was such a fucking thrill to witness.

For me the story is pretty confusing, as I understand it this game takes place somewhere between some of the other games (which themselves were not released in the order in which the story takes place), and you control Snake (or some version of him anyway) just like the other games. You can't really ask me about the story because I find it pretty hard to comprehend, but I do think that the voice acting is top notch and the storytelling done primarily through audio logs and voice calls (similar to some immersive sim games like Deus Ex and System Shock) is a great touch as it allows you mostly to focus on the action rather than get interrupted by cutscenes all of the time. 

Even though the gameplay loop is a bit repetitive (drop into an area, extract/eliminate some target person or thing and get out) it's still really fun mainly because navigating how to steathily penetrate the base full of clever AI is sort of like a puzzle.

Tactical shooter fans will find a lot to enjoy here, even if they're the type that will have to try and ignore the fantasy elements. Everything from deep weapon customization to a well rounded PMC meta-game is here as well.

  It's not as if there aren't negatives. Certain things that should be there but were likely left out due to the unfinished nature of the game, and even genuine gripes like the fact that this is a shooter with guns that don't always fire straight on their first shot and spread, or enemies occasionally seeing you through terrain. But my reasons to positively recommend this game to just about anyone who might be interested far outweigh the negatives.

The way that they've played with events of the Afghanistan War to create a gripping 80's futuristic narrative is phenomenal. The story within a story concept makes you analyse the story from all sides as the true extent of things are not conveyed to you using traditional mediums. 
The game is an experience like no other and even years later players are discovering new mechanics, very few games are able to do that.
Visually speaking for a game released in 2015 it looks phenomenal, the FOX engine does an amazing job in creating photo-realistic  models and environments.
The game way of using cassette tapes to convey key information for the game is seen by many as a big problem, but the way the game was written as a sort of alternate history story makes it kinda understandable, taking into consideration how cassette tapes were actually used by militant forces in the area during the time.
In other words......Good Game.

I think gameplay-vise this game is the best MGS in the series (only MGS 3 can rival it in some features maybe).

About the story... It's not bad, not awful it's rather misunderstood i think. A lot of folks said that ""KONAMI bad didnt let Kojima-san complete the story"" and it's maybe somewhat true but actualy story itself made its purpase and it made an impact, atleast on me. I felt sad at the end (no ending to war, no relief from vengeance, everyone that i cared about - Miller, Ocelot and etc - tricked me to believe in my false identity, comrades that i lost.... my end at Outer Heaven from hands of my idol - Solid Snake). The game tricked me (maybe not in best ways sometimes but still). 

Story was anti-war themed and saga came to its conclusion and thats it. It was Phatnom as you (we all died in Outer Heaven).

And i think people... ehh... Waiting too much from Kojima (i always thought he is a good designer but there always should be a guy who will ""cut his creative hands"". 

So yeah... Still after all those years i came back to it and it feels so good. One of my favorites. Can't give it a score actualy. Play it and try not to wait some grandious game from Kojima but as a game that let's you actualy play the way you wanting.

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an excellent game impeded by it's own mind-numbingly padded story that resembles a reality TV show. However, it manages to overcome these flaws through lore, gameplay and graphics.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
Pros
-Very well optimized.
-Enemies have interesting designs.
-Looks great.
-Realistic, when it is.
-Cutscenes have a shaky camera, as if an actual cameraman were there recording it.
-Weird handling. To see this in action, or to have fun, get a ZHUK BR3, find a flat area and hold A or D.

Cons
-Padded story.
-Lore is difficult to understand for first-time players.
-Toxic online community.
-You are forced to build an FOB for the game's online section.
-Has many of the issues that shows like Kitchen Nightmares or reality TV shows in general tend to have. For example, clichés, unnecessary slowmos and zooming when there's a reveal, or new character.
-No anticheat.
-The game's best weapons take days to unlock and are expensive, but how convenient that you can purchase what are essentially Konami Coins to skip the wait?
-Microtransactions and pay to win. The last tiers of weapons are ridiculous.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain manages to do what most games fail at; it manages to look great while playing very smooth at the same time. It is very well optimized, and only falls below 60 FPS when the screen is bombarded with particles or in the jungled areas of Africa.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
As with all Metal Gear Solid games, you must sneak and not become spotted, however you still have a viable arsenal to use in case you get spotted.

[h1]Updates[/h1]
The only thing resembling updates are weekly new FOB events.

[h1]Online[/h1]
There is no point to playing MGSV's online portion, as the only players that play it are the fanatics who play the FOB mode, as with all games that have low online populations. Notably, the remaining fanatics are just sweats, sadly.

[b]There is no way to delete your FOB in order to remove your online progress, as keeping one is merely an unfun hassle.[/b]

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
Very clean with excellent tracks scattered about. Shame that some of the best tracks like Nuclear aren't ingame.


[h1]Rating[/h1]

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, at the same time, wants to be a videogame and a TV show.  It found a balance between those two, and plays great. While the online part of MGSV:TPP is not worth your time, it's singleplayer mode is sure to soak up quite a few hours from even the newest players of the Metal Gear Solid franchise.

Despite a wall of negative pros, it still manages to be a solid game, as long as you don't touch the online portion.. at all.",1548508638,1685183487,True,0,2,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

⭐⭐☆☆☆

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an enigma wrapped in a conspiracy, and it's time to expose the truth. As a firm believer in the ""S3 PROGRAM"" orchestrated by the genius puppet master Hideo Kojima, my experience with this game was simultaneously thrilling and terrifying. Allow me to unravel the cryptic layers and share my thoughts on this mind-altering experience.

First and foremost, it's imperative to acknowledge Kojima's covert influence on unsuspecting players through his intricate web of storytelling. By delving deep into the twisted psyche of Big Boss, one cannot help but question their own sanity. The game's narrative, seemingly an innocent tale of espionage and revenge, unveils itself to be a malevolent tool of mind control, ingeniously masked as entertainment. Kojima's mastery lies in manipulating our very thoughts and emotions, leaving us vulnerable to his sinister agenda.

The parallels to the ""ghost in a shell"" are strikingly evident, as Kojima pulls the strings of our minds like a puppet master. One cannot help but appreciate the audacity with which he injects Big Boss' meme into our very being. It's as if we are caught in an elaborate game of psychological warfare, fighting to maintain our own identity amidst the chaos. Kojima cleverly disguises his intentions within the game's mechanics, blurring the line between fiction and reality.

Visually, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a stunning work of art, mirroring the haunting aesthetic of Kojima's deceptive brilliance. The attention to detail is astounding, but every element seems to be a meticulously crafted tool to further the S3 PROGRAM's influence. Each frame and character design becomes an intricate piece of the puzzle, unveiling hidden meanings and messages. It's both mesmerizing and disturbing.

Gameplay-wise, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain delivers an unparalleled sense of control and freedom. The tactical espionage action feels immersive, yet I couldn't shake the feeling that every move I made was being orchestrated by an unseen force. It's as if Kojima's omnipresence looms over every decision, manipulating us like pawns in his grand scheme. It's simultaneously empowering and terrifying, a paradox that epitomizes the entire experience.

In conclusion, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a testament to Hideo Kojima's diabolical genius. It's a game that transcends the boundaries of entertainment, delving deep into the realm of psychological warfare. Whether you believe in the conspiracy theories surrounding Kojima's mind control techniques or not, there's no denying the impact this game has on one's perception of reality. Thank you, Hideo Kojima, for embedding Big Boss' meme into my shell and reminding me that the puppet master's influence extends far beyond the confines of our screens.",1685153344,1685153344,True,2,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,True,False

Having only started the series this year, playing these games back to back has been great, and I've loved seeing how much they've changed and evolved. While the story hasn't done as much for me as 3's or especially 4's did, the gameplay alone is enough to make up for it. You truly do feel like the greatest soldier in the world, with stealth making you feel like a tactical genius, or ramboing your way through like a force of nature.

This game pretty much requires patience to be skilled at and enjoy, and it is extremely satisfying when you take down enemy bases smoothly without any alarms raised and it pays off if you play it with stealth rather than guns blazing, (which can often be fun but is not how the game is meant to be played,) It is a incredibly fun game, so if you are willing to patient and strategic, MGS V can be super fun. A couple other things to keep in mind is that: 1. This is not a third person shooter, i guess you could try to play it like like one, but as i said, its not meant to be played that way. it is a stealth game. 2. you do not need to play the other Metal Gear Solid games to enjoy five, (i have not played the other MGS games besides a little Rising Revengeance), but i enjoyed it without having too.",1685126894,1685126894,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

   The first game I played that got me into the series was Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots for the PlayStation 3. Didn't know what was going on in the story (even played it twice and close attention), but I enjoyed the game regardless. Now after finished Metal Gear Solid 5, I loved the this game from the bottom of my heart and probably won't see another Metal Gear game by Hideo Kojima. Chapter 2 has little continuation story but the rest was reused mission with harder settings. 
   Wish if *cough  trash Konami cough* give Hideo more time make this game to the fullest. I got this game at a discount cause I want to pay full price for Hideo than for Konami. So on that note buy the game for the best single player open world you will enjoy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taking place in 1984 Soviet occupied Afghanistan and in PMC occupied Angola, you play as Naked Snake / Big Boss' alibi, Venom Snake. Your task is to take down Skullface, the commander of XOF. It begins directly after Peace Walker and Ground Zeroes, with Snake waking up in a hospital bed in Cyprus. Your job is to manage Mother Base by building it using resources found and by hiring new staff to manage and occupy it.

This game is a masterclass on stealth mechanics with an attention to detail only Kojima and his team is capable of creating. This game not only artfully displays the excellence and flair that the Metal Gear Solid series is so good at portraying, it fixes some of the largest plot holes in the Metal Gear storyline. Classic items such as the cardboard box and tranquilizer pistol are at your disposal while new items such as fully customizable weapons and the buddy system with characters such as Quiet and D-Dog. The game play is nearly flawless. Each punch thrown, bullet fired, and item used, feels as if it has real weight to it. And with the plethora of new ways to play in an open world sandbox, the limit is your imagination.

The FOX engine this game is built on allows superb draw distance and beautiful lighting effects while maintaining a very high frame rate. The textures always look crisp and not a visible pixel is seen throughout. The models of your character, enemy soldiers, fellow Diamond Dogs, wild animals, and vehicles are all great. No detail is spared and to top it all off, you have your own choice of two entire open worlds to play through at your own pace. From the main missions that contribute to the story, to the side ops for extra cash and resources, each mission can be approached at least one hundred different ways with infinite different combinations of gear and planning.

This being a game set in the Metal Gear universe means the story is complicated and requires knowledge on the previous and future games to get a grasp. Although this can be seen as an issue, this game does a great job with visual storytelling and includes some of the most important characters in the franchise. Revolver Ocelot is revisited and he functions as your mentor in this game. Other notable characters include Kazuhira Miller, Paz Ortega, and Huey Emmerich. Mentions of [i]The Boss[/i] and a cameo of a young Liquid Snake are also notable appearances. The method of storytelling is unique in the fact you receive information via tapes you play as audio. These can be listened to an infinite amount of times and during gameplay as background audio. Although a new idea, I feel it fits well with this game because of the less linear path of completion the player takes. 

And with all the praise it has received, this game has some glaring issues. The story line is unfinished, period. Konami pushed the release date too soon and Kojima's team was unable to keep up with the outrageous deadlines. After some haggling, the game was released in an unfinished state, with cut content being found in the game files. This is why towards the second half of the game, the story comes to a halt with no closure available to the player. Game wise, the application is limited to 100 frames per second, which can be seen as a downside depending on who you ask. The game was also primarily designed for console (Playstation 4), with some features such as the auto-aim correction more or less being an annoyance to PC users. But of all the criticisms this game has, not a single one outweighs the gameplay and immersion it brings to the player.

[b]TL:DR[/b]

If you're looking for a PC stealth game, this is your choice. There is not a single better stealth game on Steam you can buy and this game is regarded by some as one of, if not, the best stealth game of all time. It is worth every cent you pay for it.

If you’re looking for a Metal Gear Solid game to start on, this is a great one to begin on too. It takes place before the majority of the games, so prior knowledge isn’t entirely required.

If you want to go full on stealth mode, or if you want to just rush in and shoot some guys, or if you want to stay far away and heavily mess with the soldier AI, the game won't stop you. You can get very creative with how you go about completing missions or side ops, the game lets you do it your own way, and that can lead to a lot of incredibly fun and memorable moments. Messing with soldier AI can produce some god damn hilarious results. 

There are some areas in the game that feel rushed, however, such as the controls for the vehicles and horses. They don't handle as well as they should, and always feel like driving on ice. On top of that, Big Boss himself can be a little funky to control sometimes, and there were several moments where I could totally climb up a small cliff edge but the game wasn't letting me have any of that. There's also the issue where the open-world aspect can lead to incredible amounts of walking between side ops and missions (but you can call the horse from anywhere on the map and it'll always come to you, so it's a non-issue unless you don't want to use the horse).

It may not satisfy fans seeking a tightly woven narrative or traditional Metal Gear Solid elements, but it stands out as a polished and immersive action-adventure game with a wealth of gameplay options and strategic depth.

Pros:

Gameplay Depth: The Phantom Pain offers an incredible amount of gameplay depth. It combines stealth, action, and open-world exploration, providing players with multiple approaches to complete missions. The freedom to choose your tactics, use different weapons, and utilize various gadgets adds to the game's replayability.

Engaging Storytelling: Metal Gear Solid games are known for their complex and thought-provoking narratives, and The Phantom Pain is no exception. It delves into themes such as war, identity, and betrayal, keeping players engaged and eager to uncover the story's mysteries.

Vast Open World: The game features an expansive open world that encourages exploration and rewards players for their curiosity. There are numerous side missions, hidden collectibles, and opportunities for player-driven experimentation, making the game world feel alive and full of secrets.

Deep Base Management: The Phantom Pain introduces Mother Base, a central hub that players can expand and customize. Managing resources, developing new technologies, and recruiting and training personnel adds a strategic and addictive layer to the gameplay.

Cons:

Unfinished Storytelling: One notable drawback of The Phantom Pain is its unfinished narrative. Due to development issues, certain story elements were left unresolved or cut, leaving players with a sense of incomplete storytelling and unanswered questions.

Lack of Traditional Metal Gear Solid Elements: The game diverges from the traditional Metal Gear Solid formula in terms of linear storytelling and lengthy cutscenes. Some longtime fans of the series may miss these aspects, as The Phantom Pain takes a more open-world and player-driven approach.

Sparse Character Development: While the gameplay shines, character development in The Phantom Pain can feel lacking. The supporting cast doesn't receive as much attention or depth as in previous Metal Gear Solid games, which can impact the emotional attachment players may have to the story and its characters.

Repetitive Mission Structure: The game's mission structure can become repetitive over time. Players may find themselves engaged in similar objectives and tasks throughout the game, which could potentially lead to a feeling of monotony.",1684565702,1684565702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am left asking myself, ""How do I honestly write this review while remaining unbiased? In all honesty, it was always going to be a challenge, but I'll give it my best shot! I've been fortunate enough to play games on all different platforms. Metal Gear Solid 1 on the PlayStation 1 back in 1998 right through to the Phantom Pain, and I can truthfully say it is a nice addition to the franchise.

The Phantom Pain brings in some new additions with Code Talker, Skull Face, and ‘Quiet’ (although maybe not Quiet if you believe the ‘Transsexual Chico theory) but also includes some classic characters known and loved throughout the franchise such as Kazuhira Miller, Revolver Ocelot, and one from the Metal Gear Solid release on the PlayStation 1 (I won’t tell you as I definitely don’t want to spoil that surprise, but this person was my favourite character from the 98 release).
I am going to touch on this point quite early in the review, so it is out of the way, but the game's ending doesn’t feel right. Metal Gear Solid 5’s mission 51 was ""cut"" from the main game, and Konami received HUGE backlash from fans. A petition was started to try and force Konami to make the 51st mission, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.
I’ll include a link here so you can watch what Mission 51 was ‘meant’ to look like:

https://youtu.be/-B4JIHh5Jqk

I can completely understand everyone’s anger at the game feeling unfinished, but what bothered me more was[spoiler]that we never got to see the final battle between Solid Snake and Venom Snake. That final battle could have been added as a substitute for the original mission 51 if time and money were an issue. It would have stayed true to Metal Gear lore and would have been welcomed by every single Metal Gear fan. Especially when you consider what we've got. Citizen5 did a truly remarkable job recreating that scene, and I will always be grateful. I will add that scene below:[/spoiler]

[url=https://steamcommunity.com:/linkfilter/?url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2540118641] Venom Finally Says Goodbye to Big Boss [/url]

Konami's response to these complaints is to point out that ""The Metal Gear Solid 5 saga already has an ending. Mission 51 doesn't finish the game's story because Mission 51 doesn't exist. The initial story goes right up to Mission 46 but has four more missions after the story has officially ended.

I am going to touch on the voice acting and say, ""It still works without Hayter."" I think Kiefer Sutherland’s voice acting for Venom Snake is spot-on. Sure, I’ll openly admit I would have preferred Hayter, and I think Kiefer could have been given more lines. I’m not sure about the budget, but he hardly speaks in comparison to the rest of the characters. I think every voice actor played their respective parts flawlessly.

The music score is good. Not as ""iconic"" as the previous Metal Gear Solid games, not flawless, but good. Harry Gregson-Williams, who has previously worked on:

[b]● 𝙼𝚎𝚝𝚊𝚕 𝙶𝚎𝚊𝚛 𝚂𝚘𝚕𝚒𝚍 𝟸: 𝚂𝚘𝚗𝚜 𝚘𝚏 𝙻𝚒𝚋𝚎𝚛𝚝𝚢
● 𝙼𝚎𝚝𝚊𝚕 𝙶𝚎𝚊𝚛 𝚂𝚘𝚕𝚒𝚍 𝟹: 𝚂𝚗𝚊𝚔𝚎 𝙴𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚛
● 𝙼𝚎𝚝𝚊𝚕 𝙶𝚎𝚊𝚛 𝚂𝚘𝚕𝚒𝚍 𝟺: 𝙶𝚞𝚗𝚜 𝚘𝚏 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝙿𝚊𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚘𝚝𝚜
● 𝙼𝚎𝚝𝚊𝚕 𝙶𝚎𝚊𝚛 𝚂𝚘𝚕𝚒𝚍 𝚅: 𝙶𝚛𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚍 𝚉𝚎𝚛𝚘𝚎𝚜[/b]

But for some strange reason, Hideo decided not to use Harry Gregson-Williams as exclusively as he did for the previous Metal Gear games.

The graphics are beautiful, in my humble opinion, and they have aged well. If you decided to play it today (2020), you wouldn’t know it was nearly a five-year-old game. Also, you totally get all the long Hideo Kojima cut scenes you have come to expect from the previous Metal Gear Solid franchise.

The gameplay is also fantastic. You can interact and assimilate with the environment flawlessly. Afghanistan, Central Africa, and Mother Base are fleshed out well, but the map can feel a little barren at times. It still has that ‘stealth’ element to it like all the other MGS games, but you can go in “all guns blazing"" if you prefer the direct approach. In addition to obviously using KB/M, you can also use a controller and switch over to the mouse for precision with your shots without the need to change it via the menu options. The ‘iconic’ cardboard box is still a feature that has been prevalent in all the Metal Gear games. You can slide down hills and hit enemies in your cardboard box, which is hilarious to do! The ‘rocket punch’ is also a fun part of the game, and I’m sure many of you will be running around Mother Base ‘rocket punching’ members of your army!

I’ve heard and read many reviews that state that the story isn’t as compelling as previous Metal Gear games, and I’ll admit, the game doesn’t have the strongest story, but if you are a fan of the franchise, you’ll still enjoy it. I will say the missions seem to be a little... repetitive (players that also own the game will understand exactly what I’m getting at). I am impressed with the topics touched on by Hideo Kojima (I won’t go into it too much because there are a couple of truly shocking scenes, and I don’t want to spoil it for first-time players). I would also recommend purchasing or replaying Ground Zero just to get a feel for the backdrop. It will help explain part of the Phantom Pain’s story.

The game also has some fun PvP elements to it, but I haven’t played it much, so I can’t really comment on how good it is. I do enjoy attacking other people’s Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) and helping to defend my friends from other attacks! I'll admit there are ""microtransactions"" in this game and a currency called ""Mother Base Coins,"" a currency that players purchase using real-world money and spend to expand their base in one of the game's multiplayer modes. Doing so not only benefits players in the game's one-versus-one multiplayer mode, called Forward Operating Base, but it also boosts the rate at which players earn resources and other currencies in the single-player campaign. I'm not sure how you personally feel about microtransactions, but you'll have to question your own ethics on the subject and come up with your own conclusion. What I will say is that it doesn't affect the main game if you decide to play alone.

With all the controversy surrounding Hideo Kojima’s move from Konami to Sony and the 2015 Game Awards, you might not want to buy the game, but I implore you to at least try it.I know I’ve touched on some ‘bad points’ of the game, and for me, that is hard to do as I’m a huge fan of the Metal Gear Solid franchise, but honestly, it is incredible, and I think it is worth a shot!

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a game that needs no introduction. Hailed as one of the best games of its generation, this masterpiece from Kojima Productions is a true work of art.

The game takes place in the year 1984, nine years after the events of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. You play as the legendary soldier Snake, who has awoken from a nine-year coma and is now seeking revenge against the shadowy organization responsible for his suffering.

The game's story is complex and engaging, with plenty of twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The gameplay is equally impressive, offering a level of freedom and versatility that is rarely seen in modern games.

You can approach each mission in a variety of ways, whether it's through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. The open-world design of the game allows you to explore the vast landscapes of Afghanistan and Africa, where you'll encounter enemies, animals, and other obstacles that will test your skills.

The game's graphics are stunning, with realistic environments and character models that bring the world to life. The sound design is also top-notch, with an epic soundtrack and realistic sound effects that enhance the game's immersive atmosphere.

Overall, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a game that deserves all the praise it has received. It's an unforgettable experience that will leave you wanting more, and it's a must-play for any fan of the action-adventure genre. If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a try.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great functioning game. Just Konami screwed this game over big time by not letting Kojima finish it. Doing what they did was completely disrespectful to the fans of the series and Kojima himself. Ironically if they just listened to Kojima and let him finish the game before releasing it, this game would've probably been one of the best video games in existence and could have earned them more money in the process. 

Knowing how Konami operates though, I'm sure they figured that turning the franchise into a bunch of pachinko machines would get them more money instead of producing a fully complete quality game that the public can enjoy. Afterall, all they ever cared about is milking money from their consumers, because why would they want the consumer to be happy? Pretty much just another greedy video game company that will destroy anything good for a profit like EA does. Which is why the indie video game market will always be superior for quality content.

Sure people would like to say, ""But without funding and a huge development team indie developed video games are inferior!"" which is not always true. What makes a good game is the passion and effort put into it, which would make me bring up something to further prove my point.

Just because you have more people working at putting a single lightbulb in, doesn't mean it automatically will be done better. Sure, if the development team is all functioning equally and have a good way to keep tabs on everything that is going on at once, it can result in a better product. However, if the people who hired and own the whole development team could care less, AKA the CEO and whoever is below him. What ends up happening is an absolute dumpster fire.

In theory, more is better, but often times having a bigger development team without any positive team effort means there's going to be people who 1. don't do their job well due to a lack of passion for what they are doing, and 2. unintentionally cause issues simply due to there being way too many things being done at once without communication. That's why you have buggy games like Fallout:76 existing.

Just look at Metal Gear Survive for example, it was released to people using the guts of MGSV's carcass. Which was literally just a way for them to earn quick cash with little effort. I mean people can complain all they want, but this is literally what the video game industry has become. Which is why I miss the old days of video games compared to modern times.",1684007343,1684007343,False,1,0,0.481468468904495239,0,True,False,False

Great game, definitely worth it's original triple A price tag of $60 but the fact that you can get it for even cheaper if you wait on a sale like $8 is just insane.

Edit: I know it's base price is 20-30 dollars right now. Was just saying even at its OG price tag it is way more than worth it. I wish I experienced this game during its hay day near release when everyone was talking about it.

Ingredients
1 tbsp vegetable oil
3 garlic cloves, chopped
3 x 400g cans black beans, drained and rinsed
3 tbsp cider vinegar
1 ½ tbsp honey
1 ½ tbsp smoked paprika
1 ½ tbsp ground cumin

Method
STEP 1
In a large frying pan, heat the oil and add the garlic. Fry until golden, then add the beans. Pour in the cider vinegar, honey and spices along with 1 tsp or more of salt, to taste. Cook until warmed through, crushing gently with the back of your wooden spoon, then set aside.

STEP 2
The best way to make the guacamole is with a large stone pestle and mortar, but you can use a medium bowl and a flat-ended rolling pin instead. Crush the garlic, coriander and chilli into a rough paste. Scoop in the avocado with a little salt and crush roughly – you want it chunky, not smooth. Squeeze in the lime juice and set aside.

STEP 3
Mix the salsa ingredients in a small bowl. Heat a griddle pan or steamer and quickly griddle the tortillas or steam a stack of them to warm up. Reheat the bean mixture.

STEP 4
To serve, put 1-2 heaped tbsp of beans on a tortilla. Top with a big spoonful of guacamole and some salsa, hot sauce and a dollop of soured cream or yogurt.

For the guacamole
1 small garlic clove
2 tbsp roughly chopped coriander
1 green chilli, sliced
2 avocados, halved and stoned
juice 1 lime
For the salsa
110g pack pomegranate seeds
1 green chilli, finely diced
1small white onion, finely diced
small handful fresh coriander, chopped
To serve
8-12 corn or flour tortillas
chipotle or other hot sauce
soured cream or coconut yogurt

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an absolute masterpiece of a game that offers a perfect blend of stealth, action, and storytelling. As someone who has been a fan of the Metal Gear Solid franchise for many years, I can confidently say that this is the best entry in the series yet.

The game's open-world design is a refreshing departure from the linear levels of previous Metal Gear Solid games. The vast and varied landscape of Afghanistan and Africa is a joy to explore, with plenty of secrets to uncover and hidden areas to discover. The game's weather system and day-night cycle also add a layer of realism to the experience, making it feel like you're really in the midst of a warzone.

The gameplay mechanics are top-notch, with a wide range of weapons and gadgets at your disposal. The stealth mechanics are particularly well-done, allowing you to approach each mission in your own way, whether that's sneaking past guards or going in guns blazing. The game also features a range of vehicles that can be used to traverse the open world, from helicopters to armored vehicles.

Of course, it wouldn't be a Metal Gear Solid game without a convoluted storyline, and The Phantom Pain certainly delivers on that front. The game's narrative is complex and multi-layered, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you engaged. The voice acting and motion capture performances are also top-notch, adding to the immersive experience.

Overall, I cannot recommend Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain enough. It's an outstanding game that should not be missed by any fans of the series, or anyone who enjoys a great action game with a compelling storyline.

Although, the game is not finished properly due to konami not giving Hideo Kojima not giving him enough time to finish the game. It is still great.",1683521794,1683521794,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

- this game requires lots of grind, even just to get through the main missions

Graphics:
+ insanely optimized - my older laptop played near-max settings very smoothly
+ open world and night-and-day cycles feel natural
+ smooth animations for nearly all characters
- Snake's loud dying sound can be a jump scare

Story:
? having good knowledge of the series will only help you
- some cinematics, while few outside the beginning and end, are quite long

If you look in 10 different sources asking for advice how to play you'll get 10 different answers - and they all would be true. Even late in game when you are generally overpowered it's easy to lose if you act too carelessly. And there's tons of challenges, so you can easily achieve bare minimum to advance the plot or replay for hours to solve a really challenging task. There's always something more to try. Love it. You play for an hour or two maybe, then easily stop because you played enough and it's getting not so interesting, but the next day you want to play some more. 10/10 for gameplay.

The plot is fairly dark and somewhat simplistic, with plenty of controversal device plots and homage to MGS fans. But it does bring different missions of the game together pretty well. The ending is quite sad. However somehow it felt satisfying to follow it to the end. 7/10

On one hand, it's undeniably a technical marvel, with gorgeous graphics, smooth controls, and a vast open world to explore. The gameplay itself is also incredibly polished, with a wealth of options for how to approach missions and an impressive level of depth to the various systems and mechanics at play.

However, there are also a number of shortcomings that hold the game back from being truly great. The story, while intriguing at first, ultimately feels disjointed and unsatisfying, with a lack of resolution and a number of plot threads left hanging. The game also leans heavily on repetition, with many of the missions feeling somewhat similar to one another and a reliance on grinding to progress.

Metal Gear Solid 5 is a game that's worth playing for its technical achievements and engaging gameplay, but falls short in terms of story and representation.

1) Amazing cinematography and graphics. Even in 2023, it still looks awesome. The MGS franchise always have great cinematography, but MGSV is another level. 
2) Unique approach to stealth. It took me a while to get use to the open world. Most stealth games are pretty much puzzles, which tend to lack replay value. For MGSV, you scout, and then plan your angle of approach, and messing with guards with infinite possibilities is hilarious. 
3) Good approach to storytelling. MGS series is criticised for their long cutscenes and boring dialogues, but personally, I enjoy them! For MGSV, the lengthy dialogues are compressed into cassette tapes, which you can listen at your own leisure if you like stories. Not as interactive as codec, but it’s a great middle ground between gamers who like stories and gamers who just wants action.

4) and tons of dark story plot….. 

Cons
1) Story feels incomplete. which is disappointing. MGS storylines, while sometimes borderline absurd, is often fun to watch, with a conclusion. Likely due to Kojima’s departure. There was apparently a 3rd chapter but that was taken out, which makes me sad.

2) Rare glitches on PC.

3) Weapons with no trademarks. Which is also lame considering how almost all the MGS games have trademarked weapons. Think M1911, SAA, or PSG-1.  Why can’t it be done for MGSV? Konami clearly cheap out.",1682442559,1682442559,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Scale:
For its size, this game is MASSIVE. There are two huge maps in the game and they both are so highly detailed. From the Afghan desert to the forest of Africa there's no such thing such as empty space. Every inch of the map is filled with vegetation, mountains, and valleys. There's always something to discover when you roam around the map.

Sometimes I think that it's crazy how a 29 GB game can be this massive. This alone is an achievement considering most AAA games take much more space but doesn't provide as much contents and features.

Story:
This game is 7 years old and you've most likely heard that this game was rushed and was released in an incomplete state. Well that's right but you wouldn't notice that until you finish chapter 1. Chapter 2 is where everything starts to feel repetitive. There are some few new story missions, yes. And some of them are heart-wrenching. But after you complete them, you'll find yourself completing repetitive side ops and doing FOBs where you raid other players' bases for eternity.

Another thing that I have to mention is that roughly 60% of the story is in the form of voice tapes so you have to listen to them to learn about the events that happen in the time period between MGS Peace Walker and Metal Gear.

If you're a long-time fan of MGS series, this game is a must play. However, if you're not familiar with the series yet, I wouldn't recommend this game as it might leave a bitter taste and make you disappointed in the whole series.

Technical:
If your PC runs on Celeron N4020, Intel HD Graphics 600, and 8 GB of RAM and you want to play an AAA game, you're in luck. This game can run on those specs without any lags or stutters (on low graphics of course) but don't worry, this game still looks amazing even on low graphics. I showed a friend of mine a screenshot of this game running on my potato laptop and they didn't believe that it was on low graphics because of how good and realistic it looked.

This game really made me question why all if not most AAA games nowadays require high specifications to run the games decently. 

Kudos for Mr. Hideo and team for making this game accessible for gamers who have potato PCs.

The control scheme is annoying, but not awful. Being made for console, several buttons and button combinations do multiple things. The game will therefore often have your character do the opposite of what you are trying to do, such as: 
- Want to climb up a ladder? Too bad, there is an edge nearby, so you will jump over that instead. 
- Want to jump over a ledge? Too bad, you instead decide to climb the ledge instead. 
- Want to extract a static weapon? Too bad, you enter it instead, exposing you to enemy gunfire. 
- You want to extract a container? Too bad, you climb it instead, making you an easy target for your enemies. 

Other issues with the controls include that they feel stiff at times, aiming out of sight is not always intuitive, walking, crawling and running are based on pseudo-tank control scheme, crawling movement depends on the direction you are looking, not on the common use of “s” is backwards and “w” is forward – changes depending on direction. 

My absolute major gripe with the game is probably the absolutely insane amount of resources you need to get the last upgrades in the game. And you will run into a wall, where you can’t actually grind more required resources, as one resource is manpower and you need S+/S++ rank personnel that can be near impossible to find “in the wild”, so you need to acquire them slowly. Very, very slowly. I have played the game for over half a year and I am still probably 3 months of combat deployments and event-point grinding away from the final upgrades. If that is even enough. 

And because of this combat deployment issue being a major time-consuming endeavor, one that largely requires the game to be online (in the background), hence this is a AAA-idle game. I think that for every 6 hours of recorded playtime (according to Steam), only one was spent on actively playing the game. And for every 5 hours spent on playing the game, four are probably spent on mindless grinding. 
And even when you have everything you need to upgrade your base and gear, you will need to wait for anywhere between one and ten+ days for the upgrade to be completed. And for items, you can only have 4 active upgrades at a time, meaning that upgrading 12 items can take a month. And this game has at least 300 unlockables and probably closer to 500, given that the first development projects usually take hours, not days, but then require you to be online/in game for that time. 
Only way to bypass this waiting time is to spend hundreds of dollars on ingame currency. Which is always great for a singleplayer game with minor multiplayer elements. 
And even with all of that, there is no way to upgrade ammo carry capacity, which is, you know, a very important thing in most games. 

I could go on for pages (my initial review was 5 A4 pages long), but I think that the bottom line is that when the game is fun, it can be very fun. Fighting, sneaking and exploring your way around the map (sadly, there are only two maps. The game gives you an impression that you will be fighting around the world, but no, only Afghanistan and Congo, which feels SO SO SO cheap) feels good. 
The story is terrible, but in a “so bad it is good” way. It can get very dark, but no matter how dark it gets, the cartoonish acting of the characters ruin any real suspense or fear you might feel. The game is also overly sexualized – in a way that leaves me cringing and with a bad taste rather than a boner. 

In the end, this game feels like it does not respect your time at all and is just a horrible insult to single player games and gamers in general. 

Only reason why I continue to pursue the final upgrades is because I got hooked on this drug. A drug that is not worth to get hooked on. This is the meth of video games.",1680434641,1682417836,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

SIX YEAR UPDATE:

Just replayed this game, and I'm way more neutral on this game now. The last 20% of the game is absolute dogshit. Just, straight up. Constantly repeating missions with artificially inflated difficulty, (Just give half of an entire outpost riot gear, Extreme missions just inflate the damage numbers and enemy health by a stupid amount.)

A lot of moments that would be incredibly impactful are almost ruined by the game's just, shit difficulty curve. The actual storyline of ""A Quiet Exit"" should leave you in tears. But odds are, you'll just be so pissed off and just thankful that it's over, you won't have any emotional space left to be sad. The lead up to the end does a good job of giving you choices. The end doesn't. You have to use certain things if you want to win. Extreme Metallic Archaea? Use Quiet with the Sinful Butterfly. If you don't, you're going to be taking potshots at the Skulls, or throwing yourself at a wall. Several of the extreme missions pretty much have you just cheesing the game in some way. It doesn't feel fulfilling. It's fucking irritating.

The open world is way more garbage than I remember too. The lack of GOOD fast travel really ruins the experience. Not to mention the helicopter rides in. So much of this game is just waiting. Wait for your guns to build. Wait for the chopper ride to let you actually play the game. Wait for this. Wait for that.

The side missions are so constantly repeated and irritating. Scan a dozen guards to find the one you're required to extract.

Bring D-Dog to sniff out the prisoner.

Extract the thing.

I used to think this game had a lot of depth, but replaying it really made it feel shallow.

The boss fights are garbage. They all have a gimmick you can use, and they're super easy to exploit. The Metal Gear of the game is a really boring fight. All of the skull fights can be cheesed with Quiet, or D-Walker.

The shooting in anything but taking a single shot, is super clunky. It's way more difficult than it should be to get multiple rounds on target when using assault rifles or SMGs. Not to mention I would be aiming for a guard's face. JUST HIS FACE, helmet no where near where I'm aiming, and it'll still ping off. This happened so many times, in so many situations that it just felt as if the aiming was just purposely messing with me.

I don't like the grading system. I rarely do in any game anymore though, so that's a thing. It felt way too easy to get an S sometimes, especially when you realize that the key to get an S is do a ""perfect stealth,"" do extra objectives, or play quick. Sometimes these just happen naturally. Without even really trying I got frequent S ranks. I rarely felt like I really earned them.

With some retrospect to the game, the characters are all really flat? Quiet is interesting, but it's obvious they couldn't do anything with her since the game is a prequel.

Next, I've grown a new hatred for the development system. So much of my time was just leaving my game on so that I could develop my items. Seriously, FUCK this system. I should not have to wait TWO HOURS FOR AN OFFLINE ITEM.

Some of this was obviously Konami being their shitty selves, but a lot more feels like haste, and laziness.

I dropped the game eventually once it felt like the game was wasting my time. Should have done it about fifty hours ago. Honestly? Skip it. Way better games out there.

OLD REVIEW:

My god... Where do I begin with this game? This game is one of the best games I have ever played. Nearly everything works together very well, and the story is amazing. I can't even put my praises into words with some of this game.

As I usually do reviews, here's a list of things that are either good, bad, or nuetral.

Positives:
+ The stealth is done so well. It's forgiving enough that new players can get into the game, but challenging enough that long time fans of the game will still have a lot of fun. You can get incredibly creative with how you do things, and can take your sweet time, or rush through it. It truly is up to you (Most of the time. There are a few places that require stealth, but for the most part stealth or loud is up to you.)
+ The shooting in this game is tight. Shooting in this game feels so good. I don't usually like how Third Person Shooters handle shooting but this game nailed it.
+ The story. Oh my god, the story in this game is brilliant. I don't even want to talk about as to not spoil anything, so just play it.
+ This game is incredibly immersive. At some points in the game, I found myself holding my breath as someone was right on top of me, nearly about to see me, and this enemy would easily kill me.
+ The writing is done so well. I felt legit sadness because of this game. Sersiously.
+ A real sense of progression is present throughout the game, you're unlocking new weapons and tools, and upgrading those new weapons and tools as you go along.
+ The world in this game is just gorgeous. This game is just gorgeous, look at it. It looks awesome.
+ This game is optimized so well. Friend of mine was running this on mostly the highest settings, or the highest, on a GTX 950, and he didn't have any issues FPS wise.
+ The AI is intelligent, and you have to keep this in mind, or you can slip up on stealth.
+ Characters are interesting, and have depth.

Nuetral:
- The opening to missions spoils a bit for the mission ahead and I found myself disliking since it ruins surprises, but I found myself just not reading these, and usually only paid attention to the dialogue, so I forgot about it times. It wasn't bad enough to really knock any points off.
- I miss David Hayter too, but frankly, Kiefer Sutherland does an amazing job as Snake and kind of grows on you.

Negatives:
- The story and game can be incredibly confusing unless you've played the previous games, or at least know what's going on, and who is who. I however, knew who was who, and what was going on, so it didn't affect me personally, but MGS is confusing, so I do need to mention this.
- This game can get incredibly frustrating at some points. Again, don't want to mention spoilers, but there are certain points that I was punching my desk at.
- Wait times... Yay... It's like an MMO but it's MGS, but you have to play during the times you wait for your weapons and things. The times early on aren't too bad, but they get pretty bad once you get on to the later stuff.


In the end, despite any flaws, I love this game, and would recommend it to anyone. Seriously, if you think you might enjoy the game, pick it up. You won't regret it.",1490826646,1682044087,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story had potential to be a thought provocative story but failed miserably.

Elements of horror appeared in mission one and gone.

The story is incomplete the beginning sold as MGSVGZ and the end is deleted.

The game follows PSP games structures episodic missions with a lot of missions repeated on higher difficulty and base management without a full satisfying story.

The main story line ended in MGS4 in a satisfying way and Peace Walker was good prequel.

It’s hard to get old games in the series last full collection was on PS3.

No. But you CAN do it, and there are tons of stuff like that all across the game (a lot of it being more useful than crawling under your horse). Playing through the game again now, it still holds up and reminds me why I liked it so much in the first place.

There is one downside, I could never beat the hardest enemies: Slippery Snake, Sticky Snake, and Stuck Snake. Slippery Snake gets you on any rocky surface or steep hill sending you straight back down. Sticky Snake lurks in every wall and every corner, blocking you from passing through doorways or climbing up ladders. The rarest of them all, Stuck Snake, attacks you in weird places like the edges of shipping containers pressed against walls, causing you to fall forever until you press every button to get free of his grasp.

the great.
-the overall game play is fun
-the amount of options to tackle any one scenario is ridiculous
-the cinematics are beautifully done
-the way the enemies upgrade their gear over time is a nice small detail but it dose not add much to the game

the bad.
-the open world is empty with very little to do
-the long chopper ride that you need to do every time you deploy
-the missions are all very repetitive and don't entice you to change the way you are playing.
-the side ops are just copy pasted and there is not much variety considering there are 157
-the wait time to develop anything is just annoying
-missions 45 and 48 basically have hit scan enemies without having hit scan enemies and one shot from them kills you
-the RNG based collectible animals
-D horse much like every other horse in gaming handles like dog shit
-D dog constantly walks in front of you when aiming a gun and will not move
-red tanks and choppers do not follow the same game rules as normal and will shoot and kill you before they are alerted

Bugs encountered while playing.
-development time is not just a timer and sometimes dose not go down for random reasons
-enemies teleporting across the map if you try to grab them
-enemies popping in and out of existence while only a few feet away
-enemies bugging out if you grab them over top of ledges and they end up seeing you
-unplugging a controller makes the game freeze
-when the game freezes for a second it teleports you 10ft in the air even if you where already in the air (I died from this)
-random teleport bug that skips half of a mission (I found this on complete accident then found out it is a speed run strat)
-tanks teleport away if they are turning when you are right next to them
-the mission tasks that require you to listen to conversations constantly bug out forcing a restart",1681572080,1681572080,False,0,1,0.457190364599227905,0,True,False,False

Metal Gear has that stealth that makes you think before moving: you have to consider where the enemy is looking, if they'll be able to see you in the bushes, if you're walking too close, the BOOM from opening a door without slowing down. It's so satisfying to get from point A to point B without a single enemy noticing you, as it is to neutralize them.
And about the combat, the game ""penalizes"" you for going for the easy way of just killing enemies: in Free Roam, it may not do much, but for getting a good rank in a mission it is absolutely crucical that you use non lethal means like Close Quarters Combat (CQC), Immobilizing guns and, most important, Tranquilizer guns. The amount of weaponry, ranging from silenced and slow shooting to BOOM and BRRRRRRRRRRRRR is huge, and all of them can be used for an advantage, be it stealth or damage.
For content, the main-missions line is rather short, only extended by some extras and unnerfed versions of some of the original levels. However, the amount of side content that can be skipped (but shouldn't) makes sure that all the time that you spend in-game is worth it. Also, from what I heard, the game has unfinished things that would have been added to the game, but the production time ran out. Shame on Konami for rushing Hideo Kojima's work!

Now, for the achievements:
I have to say, the replay factor comes mainly from the need of having to redo the main story, but with tasks to add some challenge and planning before a mission starts. Most of them were pretty good, especially when bossfights were included; however, I stand my ground to say that the ""Listen to Conversations"" tasks were the worst! Only one alert/detection and you're resetting or loading a checkpoint.
Most of the achievements are done by just playing the game to it's completion (reaching 100% on the title screen), that means getting S Rank and all tasks on all missions, doing every side quest, getting every document, project, photo and animal. Only some are out of this list, like building and then disarming a nuke, developing 300+ items, infiltrating a FOB (multiplayer required) and doing a mission with one of your troops.
Didn't take too long though. I can say I enjoyed hunting them!",1681199391,1681199391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, Konami absolutely treated Kojima like trash.

Yes, this game lacks a 3rd act. Yes, Quiet's excuse for her gratuitious skin show is stupid. Yes, Konami wants to cram in as many microtransactions as humanly possible. Yes, it's annoying that Venom Snake is almost a silent protagonist. Yes, the cutscenes are extremely short and there aren't as many as in previous games. Yes, this game is open world and it would make Ubisoft blush. Yes, most people may not like the tapes as a replacement for long Codec conversations. And f**k Huey. Seriously, f**k him.

But you know what?, for all it's faults, it's my personal GOTY 2015 runner up (slightly behind The Witcher 3), because I haven't had this much fun with an action-stealth videogame in a long, long time, it's easily one of the best in the genre and I'd still whole heartedly recommend it, just keep in check your expectations and everything will go smoothly.

Get it, it's fu**ing awesome :)

I've unlocked and developed every weapon, I've upgraded every buddy, I've completed Mother Base and my FOB, I've developed, stolen, and diffused nukes. I've made myself demonic, with a huge horn and blood-covered face and gear, and then redeemed myself with a massive increase in heroism. I've played all through Chapter One, and completed the non-repeat missions of Chapter 2. I've learned the twists, I've seen the deleted footage, and I've Fulton extracted so many resources I don't have any space left for more.

Yet one thing remains consistent: every time I load up this game, I have a blast. It's amazingly fun.

Sure, many people are dissatisfied with the story, or rather its conclusion, especially with the reveal of the incomplete chapter and lack of response from Konami. But this game is amazingly fun, and I think that matters most.

I've been a longtime fan of the series, since I was introduced to MGS on the PSone as a young kid. I've played every game repeatedly, excluding the handheld releases. I've been a fan of the Solid Snake and Big Boss stories, including the ""crazy, but somehow just enough realism to be outrageously possible"" villains, story twists, and plots. Grey Fox for life.

While I agree that this game's story, including the tapes, doesn't hold a candle to the previous installments, the game succeeds in being the most fun MGS installment I've played in spite, or perhaps because, of this. The FOX engine is fantastic, and an absolute tragedy that it may never be seen again.

Is it Kojima's greatest work? It's definitely not his greatest story, but I'd have to say it's his greatest game. This game excels, and has given me far more playtime than any other game I've played.",1441107455,1680674815,True,5,0,0.51287001371383667,0,True,False,False

Personally the characterization of venom and how he contrast with solid and the rest of the snakes and their stories makes this game a diamond in the rough (couldnt be a more literal statement). You can tell after playing the in depth mechanics and trying to go for all objectives in one go on any given mission, that this game was clearly intended for a lot more. Regardless of the let down this game ultimately became, it gave me one of my favorite characters to exist in fiction ever, so much so I wrote a english final about the concept of ""The Man Who Sold The World"" and it only made me more emotional about the story of Metal Gear. In conclusion I hope Kojima knows that I cant possibly let a game franchise so good go out with such a bitter end. So for the sake of us all.

MGSV is great in a lot of aspects, gunplay, stealth, sandbox elements, and has a decent but not nearly as engaging story. With all that said, it's also quite flawed. The gameplay can get quite repetitive. The older games did have instances of you having to backtrack sometimes but this game's Ubisoft-esque open world design means you will be doing so many repetitive missions over and over in the same locations. Luckily, this isn't some dogshit ass Ubisoft game that lacks pretty much any characters I care about since it does include obviously some classic, well known characters from the MGS universe as well as some interesting new ones. The result is that the game manages to keep you engaged enough, though I would say this game definitely requires you to have some basic understanding of the entire storyline or at least some experience with the past games to make it easier to keep on playing. I could totally understand a person who has never touched a Metal Gear Solid game to lose interest, because I myself had done the same at first. I didn't come back to this game until I had at least played MGS3.

In a review I made about Death Stranding, I mentioned this game was one of the reasons why I liked MGSV, that's still holds true, in fact, this actually inspired me to look deeper into the history of Metal Gear, and also make my first draft for this review (which, while good, kinda sucks as well in my opinion.), but enough of that, let's get to the stuff.

Story: Surprisingly, It's superb, the cassette tapes itself also help when trying to understand this, and the storytelling is just, wow, no words, personal favorite characters that I have from this game is Kaz and Big Boss, and yes, since this (was) is a Hideo Kojima game before Konami kicked him out, but the drama's a another story for another day, and while I can understand that some people might not like Phantom Pain's story, just try and look for certain story details, trust me, you may not regret it, but if not, at least you tried.

Gameplay: Simple and not bad, Easy and hard to master, I mostly like how the gameplay actually adjusts to your playstyle and use it against you (i.e: if you use Decoys too much, the enemy starts using decoys as well), and the multiplayer stuff, while i haven't actually played it, it seems worth trying one day, so I'll keep it in mind, but yeah, not to mention that the day and night cycle in this game is amazing, no other words for now but the amount of freedom you have when playing this game is impressive, in Ocelot's words: ""Pretty good.""

Music: they compliement the game, and i don't just mean the gameplay, cutscenes and everything, all in special thanks to Ludwig Forsell ( I hope I typed it correctly), just something about the music from Quiet's Theme's sadness and Behind the Mirror's Heroic yet Tragic end just give it that punch needed to help carry the game, and not to mention the licensed music, like ""The Man Who Sold The World"" setting the theme for this game, it's amazing.

Final Thoughts: While this review's not too long, and not too short, I Implore you to get this game (and Ground Zeroes) just for the story, although, I advice you enter this game with some knowledge of the MGS games (Metal Gear on the MSX included), as some moments can be a little confusing if not given the right knowledge, Overall, I like this game, and in my opinion, tells a tale of revenge of sorts better then TLOU2, and all of this, because of the rising meme of MGR lol, but genuinely, one of the best games i've played in a list, if this review seems to be rushed (somewhat), that wasn't the purpose, but would be ironic, I can't deny that this game felt a little imcomplete with a certain mission missing from the game but I digress, and not to mention that one of the twists in this game is a massive spoiler that will change how you view the main character, but enough of that, because while slightly unfinished, still a great finale for the MGS saga, and a stepping stone for Hideo Kojima to create Death Stranding after his departure from Konami, in other words: Thank you, Kojima

MGSV came out in 2015 and still holds up very well visually while still being well optimized. Sure the textures aren't as high quality as games nowadays but it has some impressive art direction that has helped it age well. I do think some of the visual effects with the man on fire were a bit weird or the 'glare' surrounding large scale fire effects in general but that is pretty much my only complaint here.

One thing I think deserves some praise is the UI. Its by far one of the best UIs I've ever seen. There's not one intrusive or irritating element and the game lets you remove any of the UI elements to your hearts content while also providing with diagetic replacements in the form of certain item upgrades. While I personally prefer using most of the UI, it is fascinating to see how the game feels without no hud.

The sound effects are all very well done from the horse as it sprints, all the various guns and items ate your disposal, the helicopter and other vehicles, the voice acting in the cutscenes and throughout the world. It adds quite a lot to the immersion in the game especially when paired with the non-intrusive UI.


[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 
Stealth games don't tend to have the best combat. Most of the gameplay is themed around hiding and avoiding fights. This is for one a very difficult system to build because you have to make hiding around and moving slowly and silently actually fun. You have to make the AI seem smart enough at finding the player while not making it look like its blatantly cheating. Metal Gear has always pushed the boundries with what can be done here but V perfects it. I don't like to use words like 'perfection' because it implies there's nothing else to fix or work on but I think it works here. It has been eight years and there is no stealth game that manages to challenge the smooth controls, insane variety of approach through area design, weapons, items, vehicles, mechanics that this game has shown. I have played more than 60 hours and I'm sure I haven't even scratched the surface of everything that the player can do in this game. 

Even if you're thrown out of stealth into a 'boss fight' you can still deal with it in a stealthy manner. And unlike the previous metal gear games, the shooting is decent enough that being thrown out of stealth isn't annoying as hell.


[h1]Story[/h1]
Metal Gear has had an interesting story throughout the past few decades. I wouldn't call it a 'good' story because Kojima has a massive lack of understanding when it comes to basics of storytelling like tone, structure or pacing. He makes up for that with how entertaining it ends up being, and interesting social and political commentary. The commentary is still here in MGSV though it's a bit subtle, subtle for MGS to be clear, since these games are pretty direct about what they want to say. It does feel a bit unfinished or abrupt in its execution but the main focus for me here is the gameplay.",1680431237,1680431237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A stealth action game must give you a motivation to play stealth: strong and smart enemies + atmosphere + exploration + empathy for the protagonist - otherwise, it's just lazy game design, ""play stealth because it's a stealth game, and don't ask questions"". This game gives zero motivation. Snake is a Rambo, the enemies are dummies, so you could just get your rifle and shoot them all, but even then it would still not be fun because the game is too boring:
* it's just a boring shooter, with bad, Splinter Cell like, shooting mechanics;
* the missions are boring: ride a horse in a dead desert, find, eliminate, ""get to da choppa"";
* same boring locations are reused for different boring missions;
* the story is for anime girls, written by the Genius himself.

What a shame.
We all know this game is unfinished. I don't care what the press releases state. Kojima should have been allowed to at least finish the game, and you know, get credit for his work by picking up his reward???
Game mechanics are fun. It's goofy in all the right ways while still maintaining its tactical/stealth elements perfectly. Only thing I really hated about the game was how all guns pretty much shared 3 sound effects. That was kind of lazy.

The story seems kinda funky with the supernatural stuff and giant robots, but the gameplay is where it's at. I'd like to think that I like the stealth game genre. This takes stealth to a whole different level. 

Overall, if you like stealth games and a rich, yet weird, story I'd recommend this 100%. I only did about 40 hours and there is post main stories and a bunch of side quests too. There is also Metal Gear Online if crave some PVP. There is a lot of content here so use that steam refund policy to give this game a try if it suits your fancy but you won't be disappointed. 8/10",1680303654,1680303654,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've heard of people who are still playing it after seven or more years! There is an incredible amount of content, with hundreds of different missions and side ops. I don't usually like modern warfare games, but this one has me totally hooked. I'm blown away by the quality of ""The Phantom Pain"".  I thought ""Ground Zeroes"" was brilliant, but that turned out to be a mere tiny fraction of what Phantom Pain offers! The graphics are first class. The voice-acting is 1st class. The cut scenes blend in seamlessly with the game action. The character movement is very realistic. The innovative features are astounding. The plethora of upgradable and customizable equipment adds massively to the fun factor, and the variety of tactics you can employ is unlimited. And there is no PITA stamina to worry about!

1: it's a well made game (for me)
2: Didn't regret buying it because it does reach my expectations.
3: Enemies (Ai soldiers) are a bit smart and hard to kill sometimes. Which makes the game more challenging.
4: Missions are not easy, specially when  you have to do the task, you'll never be able to get it all in 1 run. Again, still that's what's makes this game more challenging.
5: There's alot of thing to do other than doing missions, and guess what? You have to develop your base!
6: I recommend this game to everyone, if you are trying to save your money, try getting it on Sale!

One of my favorite things in games is Progression and boy is there progression. This game also reminds me of ""Shadow of War"" (Another one of my favorite games of all times) with its whole building a base with people you can recruit off the battlefield and invading other peoples bases, but this time you can defend if someone is raiding which is awesome. So many guns and tools to your arsenal that every mission can be played out in a bunch of ways. Replayability with Mission tasks that tell you what you can do after you complete the mission. Open world freedom within the Afghanistan and Africa maps. Tons of secrets and easter eggs, my favorite being the Happy birthday one (What other game do you know that celebrates your birthday with a cutscene in game?) Although a confusing story, I can very much appreciate it when you put the pieces of the puzzle together (Much like Dark Souls). Not as cool boss fights as in previous Metal Gears, with this game being a Open world aspect of just running away and shooting (especially with the Skulls but I still enjoy fighting them sometimes). And this game is just not all about being stealthy, you are given the arsenal to go loud if you want. You do have to wait for some things to finish developing and in my opinion that should only be the online stuff that has that and also the game likes to toy with me by putting the smallest rock or cliff face and I always keep sliding down it even though ""I"" could even walk over it or climb it and every time I slip I feel my brain matter deteriorating. If there was one thing I want now after playing this game, that would be to be able to play all the Metal Gears on Steam.

But for those of you who haven't, let me tell you, this game is a trip. It's got more twists and turns than a rollercoaster, more espionage than a James Bond movie, and more ""WTF"" moments than you can shake a stick at.

And speaking of ""WTF"" moments, have you ever wondered what it's like to be inside the mind of Hideo Kojima? Well, let me tell you, it's like being on a really strong dose of... well, let's just say Kojima's marijuana must be pretty potent. But don't worry, folks, it's all in good fun.

Now, some of you might be wondering, ""Hey, Hyrden, how do you know so much about Metal Gear Solid 5?"" Well, let me tell you, I've spent more time playing this game than I care to admit. In fact, I think I've got our friend in the front row beat - they've played it for a thousand hours on their PS4! That's dedication, folks.

And you know what's even more impressive? They went and bought it again for their PC! That's like buying a second copy of the Bible, folks. But I get it, I really do. This game has it all. Stealth action, incredible music, and some of the craziest plot twists you'll ever see in a video game.

So, to sum it all up, Metal Gear Solid 5 is a game that will leave you speechless, make you question reality, and keep you coming back for more, no matter what platform it's on. So, if you haven't played it yet, what are you waiting for? Trust me, it's worth the thousand hours.",1594593251,1679447694,True,1,1,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False

Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of liberty came out. the older brother returned home and gave his little brother the game. Little did the older brother relized his younger brother was going thru a deep depersion, where suicide seem the only peace. But the older brother never relized that Metal Gear Solid was keeping him at peace. It was the only thing to keep him sane. Till this day the younger brother still plays all the Metal Gear games. It always makes him smile and happy knowing that him and his brother enjoyed playing Metal Gear Solid. It fills his mind with awesome childhood memories that he will always cherrish.

A soldier creeps, unseen from sight,
In Metal Gear Solid V he plays,
A game of stealth, through war-torn days.

As Snake, he sneaks and crawls along,
Avoiding guards, remaining strong,
With tranquilizer gun in hand,
He moves with purpose, with a plan.

The Phantom Pain, a burden borne,
As Snake grapples with the forlorn,
Memories of comrades lost,
Betrayals borne at a great cost.

A game of strategy and skill,
Of espionage and tactics, still,
Metal Gear Solid V draws you in,
A tale of heroes, loss, and sin.

With themes of war and sacrifice,
And questions that may not suffice,
The Phantom Pain, it haunts and stings,
And yet, it echoes and still rings.

A story that will always last,
Metal Gear Solid V, a masterpiece,
A game that will never cease.",1678918901,1678918901,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- the buddies and gear, especially the more sci-fi / cyberpunk stuff, are really creative and often make for a good laugh

The controls are tight and responsive, allowing you to easily navigate the game's vast open world and engage in intense firefights with enemies. The stealth mechanics are some of the best ever seen in a game, giving you a range of options for taking down enemies and completing missions.

The level design is also exceptional, with each mission offering a range of different approaches and strategies. Whether you prefer to go in guns blazing or take a more stealthy approach, there is always a way to complete the mission that suits your playstyle.

The game's visuals are also breathtaking, with stunning graphics that bring the game's world to life in vivid detail. The game's soundtrack is also exceptional, with a range of memorable tracks that perfectly capture the game's tense and emotional moments.

One of the best games I ever played! If someone will ask me about the top 3 of my most favorite games, then this game would be in those 3. Awesome stealth, a lot of variety of taking down the enemy. Sadly the online is low (around 1k players on average), and if you want to play MGS5 online you'll have to wait a lot or call your friends.

Actually the main character here is the camera-man. I love how other characters giving space to the camera-man while he's filming them in the cutscenes so he can walk around (not including that MF skull face, he pushed the camera-man at the start of mission 12).",1657987152,1678097499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd say that the story is not nearly as bad as people say, though it's a far cry from the slept on masterpiece many others proclaim it as.
It's Kojima being batsh*t, same as always. For me the real flaws were in some of the missions, I won't go into specifics to avoid spoilers but many of the encounters are very poorly designed in my opinion, especially those involving the Skulls [spoiler] Except the sniper one that was good [/spoiler].

BUT

The core mechanics of this game are excellent, this is certainly the best 'Tactical Stealth' game on the market, and speaking of the market this game is usually 7 quid or lower during sales so get it when it's cheap, it may take 80 hours to beat but 70 of those are excellent.

The open world type approach is a hit or miss for fans but for me I think it's cool. The gun play and overall game play feels really smooth and graphics wise this game very nice. I think there are a few things that I do miss especially the boss fights for this game series and getting to know all the characters really got me excited when playing the series, but I was sad that they didn't have that many the og traditional boss fights that we see from the older games. Some negatives with this game is the story-line. It honestly felt a bit rushed and not really interesting, some parts of the story mode missions seemed fun and interesting at times but there were some missions that were just so boring that I wouldn't even trying being stealthy and just run with a rocket launcher and machine gun.

1. His story, which although not bad in itself, quite the contrary, very interesting and elaborate, has the defect of being clearly incomplete
2. The monotony of the missions, since although they can change in types and ways of achieving the mission, the variation between them is very poor, often being limited to having different objectives, but similar procedures
3. The great void left by finishing the story of this game, since as I said in the first point, the story is incomplete and after completing all the secondary missions, the only thing you can do is invade other online bases and increase the level of your weapons
In conclusion, a great game with innovative ideas and dynamics, which could have become more, if not for a certain company.

Gameplay mechanic is good for my taste of being espionage type of game [which its that kind of game] or you can be aggressor approach type of player too.

Difficulty gameplay is depend on what your play style do most [complete missions point] in stealth or blasting every enemy you see. There is counter mechanic, which for me is clever and interesting. Like the game want to say ""you cannot just infiltrate enemy base only just stealth, right??"", then it will counter by making enemy easy to see you on your next mission.

For story telling, I can say for the first timer play this Metal Gear franchise. If you just only go through cutscenes, you will/not understands the major reasons MGSV happen. Another half of those story can be completely covered by hearing voice tape that every main missions completed [especially yellow/gold highlight].

For PVP kind of gameplay, I'm cannot say since I'm not type of person who's competitive and try to steal someone's properties. There are community in this steam/other would give the idea of it's gameplay.

For me this game is 8/10 score, these game like open world but is lacking npc to interact in outside world [except in mother base]. There must be some little civilians in some town in this warzone. The side mission, for me is same cycle of the same type of missions [rescue, kill soldier, destroy tank] only with number differences. At least give some story telling for reasoning behind those side mission.

Pros:
- Combat and stealth are pretty fun and you have lots of options
- Music is great, both the original soundtrack and the tapes you can find
- Story is pretty interesting and well written, and it has some funny bits too
- The main character is sexy and the dog is cute
- Map is big and detailed
- Lots of little easter eggs and small details you can find, like overhearing conversions between enemy soldiers
- It feels very well fleshed out and like the devs were really passionate about it, and I didn't encounter many bugs or issues

Cons:
- You can really tell that it's meant to be a console game, they changed basically nothing for the PC version
- A lot of the scientific explanations for things don't make any sense
- I would prefer if you had some freedom in where the story went
- No manual save system
- So many unnecessary credits rolls, and there are a lot of animations that take slightly too long and interactions that take a few more button presses than they should - it's a bit like the iOS of gaming
- They really want you to play online

In some ways it feels more like a movie than a game, which can be both good and bad, but I think it works pretty well  in this game most of the time.",1677274687,1677274861,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

- No mouse support in menu, even though there is a cursor.
- Sound volume can't be adjusted. I had the system volume at 50% and it was too loud, without a way to adjust it ingame.
- No FOV adjustment.
- No quicksave. Not possible to save during mission.
- Depth of field makes the screen randomly blurry.
- 3rd person is awkward and hinders the player.
- Controls reverse depending on camera rotation, especially when crawling. Worst crawling controls.

Tutorial:
- Look around: Everything works.
- Look up: Reverses vertical rotation. Had to change it back in the settings.

The entire 2h long introduction thing was completely ridiculous, made no sense and had seemingly nothing to do with the rest of the game. Half the time you look at a dude's hairy ass.

The environment is cheaper then in many indie games. Couldn't have been much work for an AAA company to produce this.

You have to press an extra button to aim properly (RMB + F). That's annoying.
Suppressors break down. After a couple shots the gun is suddenly loud. What bullshit. Not fun and not realistic. (Just as the tranquilizer gun. No one would risk anything in war to be nice.) A stealth game where you artificially are not allowed to be stealthy. I assume infinite silent shots would make the game too easy, which says a lot about game design and AI. Guns blazing seems what the game is designed for and the arsenal proves it: shotguns, assault rifles, grenade/rocket launchers, machine guns. Why advertise stealth and then break it?

Instead of meaningful story progression like in MGS1 that leads EVERYTIME to a different situation, you get to select the next meaningless, identical mission from a menu.

I mean, we're talking about a game where you can call in a helicopter to air-lift a cow out of a warzone. Yes, you heard that right - a cow. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

The game's storyline is as convoluted as a bowl of spaghetti, and just as messy. But that's part of the charm, isn't it? You play as the legendary soldier, Big Boss, who wakes up from a coma and sets out on a mission to rebuild his army and take revenge on those who wronged him. Along the way, you'll encounter a cast of characters that are equal parts wacky and awesome.

One of the highlights of the game is the ability to sneak around and take out enemies in a variety of creative ways. You can hide in cardboard boxes, distract guards with magazines, and even Fulton extract enemies (yes, that means you attach a balloon to them and send them flying off into the sky). It's ridiculous, but it works.

And let's not forget the game's iconic theme song, ""The Man Who Sold The World"" by David Bowie. It's so good that you'll find yourself humming it for days on end.

Overall, Metal Gear Solid 5: Phantom Pain is a wild ride that'll keep you entertained for hours on end. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the series or a newcomer, there's something here for everyone. So go ahead, strap on your eyepatch, grab your silenced pistol, and get ready for some hilariously absurd espionage action.",1676920912,1676920912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Probably one of the best games of all time. And imagine it wasn't even finished! What kind of game would it have been if Kojima never parted ways with Konami. 

How to approach a mission? Well sky's the limit, just be creative and have fun, the options are there. Building a base? Check. 
Customizing your weapons? Check. 
Huge arsenal to select from? Check.

Because others described the story of this game well, I also decided to buy the game and play it.

In the first few hours of the game, everything was fine, but after a while, I realized that the game maker designed irrelevant and even repetitive stages in the game to make the game longer.
The stages of the game sometimes take you away from the main story and make you pause for several hours.

The story of the game is a good and acceptable story, but because you don't have the necessary equipment in some stages, that stage will be difficult for you! Of course, I think that the mission of the game will happen a little earlier for you, and at this time you will not be able to continue the game easily.

In some missions, unreasonable requests are made of you, such as (reject the mission without being exposed) or (destroy a few tanks at the beginning of the game when you have weak equipment).

The gameplay is such that it can be annoying, such as (controlling the horse when you have to quickly pass the obstacles), (you cannot jump freely and it may happen in some places when you are running away from the enemy again be thrown in the same place as before and you cannot escape from the roof), (stealth in the game is such that after killing your enemy for a long time, you will be killed irrationally with a small mistake and your time will be wasted), (possible side missions It is time-consuming and you have to look for a piece of paper or a child for an hour, the game could guide the player in this case, but there is no such thing in this game.

Judging by my playtime, I think it's obvious that I finished the tutorial, and then barely the first mission. In that time, nothing really grabbed me. I'll admit, I was interested in the storytelling, at least during the first half of the tutorial. But man, does this game take it's sweet time. Not necessarily in slow-paced, I'm just too impatient kind of way. I mean a repetitive script that really tries to hammer home the exact same points three times kind of way. That's why the game gripped me for the first 20 minutes, honestly. I thought it was the former. But finishing the tutorial and first mission, I think I've grasped it to be the latter. Or... at least more of the latter category that I can take.

For example, in the intro mission, I was actually quite curious about the Flame-on man. I haven't played the other MG games, but I've heard they go buck wild, so I rolled with it and found it quite fun. What I didn't find fun was the repetitive 'sneak around the guys' aspect, which was probably the entire 1 hour on-rails intro. To make matters worse, Mr. Flame-On made too many appearances to keep the mystery engaging, as I believe they show the same scene about 5 times. It goes something like this -- Bad guys are about to kill us. Mr. Flame-On shows up to ruin everyone else's day so he can then slowly walk at us and ruin our day. BUT! Right before he can get us, A helicopter shoots! He's distracted! Get out of there! He takes down the helicopter, but it gave us just enough time to escape!
Sounds cool, right? That's because it is. But the script thought it was SO cool that they did this exact type of scene like 4 times in that tutorial mission. Switch out a APC for the helicopter and BAM, got us another bomb-ass scene, no? Well, not really, Because it's exactly the same as the other one I saw like 5 minutes ago.

Judging by the negative reviews I read, I think this is indicative of the core gameplay, as well. But don't get me wrong -- I love to play shooters with wacky gimmick gadgets and sneakery, and the game feels good to play. I've played plenty of Ubisoft games with a loose story and a horde of encampments to muck about in.

But that's what this game feels to be, albeit with maybe less in the open world? I won't touch on that, as I clearly didn't get to the open world aspect. From other negative reviews though, the adjective of import seems to be ""empty.""

If you're a huge fan of the MG series, and are willing to put up with sneak sneak shoot shoot extract, over and over again, with a story that seems interesting but clunky, then go for it! This is probably the game for you.

As for someone who wants to get into the series but also enjoys when games provide interesting gameplay mechanics, I'd say give this one a pass.",1676475013,1676475013,False,2,0,0.440251559019088745,0,True,False,False

Set in 1984, you play as ""Punished"" Venom Snake, as he and his ""Army Without A Nation"" seek revenge for the destruction of Mother Base 9 years prior to the events of Phantom Pain (Ground Zeroes).

The Phantom Pain is perhaps the greatest stealth game ever made. Unlike other games in the franchise, Metal Gear Solid V is open-world, giving you a multitude of options of how you conduct missions. You can infiltrate bases of operations any way you want to honestly. If you want to find a good vantage point to map out the area and get an idea of the soldiers in bases/outposts, you can do that. If you prefer to go in guns blazing, you can do that too. Everything you can think of is at the disposal of the player, and it really offers so many different ways to get creative. The enemy A.I. adapts with the player as well. Going for a lot of headshots throughout the game causes guards to wear helmets. Relying too much on smoke grenades, and guards will start wearing gas masks. Outpost shifts change as well, according to the time of day. You might see more guards at night, using strobe lights to search the area, whereas in the daytime, that wouldn't be needed. Sneaking into bases at night limits the visibility of guards, and shadows can be used as effective cover. The unlimited ways of performing stealth infiltration really is the selling point of Metal Gear Solid V.

The game takes place in Afghanistan and in parts of Africa during 1984. With being an open-world game, you would hope for cities or NPCs to react with, or a decent amount of side activities, but that's not the case here. The purpose of MGSV's open-world is to give players the freedom of how they want to go about missions. That's not to say the areas in which this game takes place don't look good, because they do, especially Africa. The rain forests are beautiful, but there isn't enough of them in the game. Some of Africa looks too similar to Afghanistan. Each setting provides weather patterns that can help you infiltrate bases easier. In Afghanistan, sandstorms will occur, severely reducing the field of vision for guards. In Africa, rain storms will mask the sound of Snake's footsteps, making it easier to move without being heard. While the setting of The Phantom Pain isn't bad, they can get bland and leave a lot to be desired.

Graphically, Metal Gear Solid V looks great. This really gets displayed out in the forests of Africa where there's a lot of vegetation and in the facial animations of the characters in the game. The Phantom Pain has some of the most cinematic cutscenes I've ever seen in a game, and the graphical detail makes them all that much better.

The gameplay itself is nearly flawless. The game rarely stutters, and I don't remember ever running into any bugs or glitches. It's extremely optimized and very smooth overall. The gameplay picks up where Peace Walker left off, and it improves on it in almost every way. Instead of the usual level system broken up by interjecting cutscenes, The Phantom Pain is much less linear, as it focuses on mission by mission gameplay. You can have your helicopter drop you in at a landing zone close to your mission objective, or you can use vehicles to travel through the open-world to get to where you need to go. Side-Ops are completely open as well, functioning similarly to Main Missions. The Mother Base building system is also brought back from Peace Walker, except this time you can actually visit Mother Base and all of the soldiers you have Fulton extracted in the field of operations. Expanding Mother Base and developing weapons is determined by GMP, the form of in-game currency that you accumulate by completing missions, acquiring materials, selling materials, achieving in-game tasks, and sending your soldiers on deployment missions. Development of weapons and Mother Base platforms also depends on the current level of your different teams of your army (Intel, R&D, Medical, Combat, Command, and Support). In almost every way, Peace Walker's development and Mother Base systems have been improved in a better way.

With all of the positives, there are a decent amount of negatives in regards to Metal Gear Solid V, and that focus is primarily in the writing and story as a whole. Traditionally, Metal Gear games will focus on the story of each game. You have a level, you progress through the level, and it triggers a cutscene (usually a lengthy cutscene). In Metal Gear Solid 1-4, the games ranged from 12-20 hours, so there was a lot of exposition dumps and story to tell. In The Phantom Pain, you're in an open-world. You're given free reign of what you want and how you want to accomplish missions. Rarely, will you see a Side-Op that has a cutscene attached to it. There's over one hundred Side-Ops in this game. The main story alone has 38 total story missions. Many of these don't relate to the main story at all, and if they do, it's vague to the plot most of the time. Take a game like Metal Gear Solid (1998). There's about three and a half hours of cutscenes in that game. That's a decent amount of time for a game that's only 10-12 hours long. Now take The Phantom Pain (at which I finished the main story after 67 hours), and that has about four hours of cutscenes. The story is there, but it's so spread out, that a lot of times you'll forget what's going on to begin with. Another thing to factor, in every Metal Gear game, including the first one from 1987, a lot of the game's story is told through Codec calls. Metal Gear Solid V completely scraps that for optional cassette tapes that you can listen to while playing the game. This is somewhat effective, but the organization of the tapes is a mess, and it really breaks the feeling that this a Metal Gear game at all. The story is about revenge, getting back what was taken away, but a lot of times Snake is ordered to do something trivial, like extract a skilled soldier. Cool. The boss fights that everyone has fallen love with in this series are almost completely absent. I believe there are six total boss fights. Six. In 70 plus hours, you have six boss fights in a Metal Gear Solid game. None of them are memorable, except for the last one, and it's a shame, because there could have been a lot of standout fights with the characters given to us in this game. Lastly, in regards to the story, it is there. Is it incomplete? Probably, yes. Is some of it unnecessary sometimes? Yes. Are there memorable moments in the main story? Absolutely, yes, and it's a shame, because what's presented in cutscenes really does look fantastic. After all of that though, there is a full story in this game (with one loose end that isn't tied up, thanks Konami), you just have to look for it more than you should have to. A true phantom pain.

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom is a must-play for anyone who is a fan of the Metal Gear series, or for anyone who is remotely interested in stealth games. It stumbles a lot on itself in terms of story telling and the way the story is presented, often times not feeling like a true Metal Gear game at all. The story isn't terrible, it just feels like an investigation for information far too often, and it leaves you wanting more. However, the gameplay alone makes it a phenomenal game. Graphically impressive, and mechanically the best stealth game of all-time, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, is a great game.

The only game where I've actually wanted to get the highest possible rank on every mission (S rank), and enjoyed it immensely. I've S ranked every mission (except some variant missions), and I'm still finding a lot of stuff to do in each mission, and free roaming is just as fun. 

The gameplay, being stealth and combat, is simply amazing. There are thousands of possibilities and ways you can complete a mission, each being completely different, but all being completely viable. The creativity possibilities and amount of repeatability is insane. The enormous and incredibly diverse arsenal you can build up of so many different types of weapons and items, all allow you to be creative and proficient in your gameplay. Also, the movement is amazing too. There's crouching, proning, walking, (all 3 can be done slowly by holding down control while moving) sprinting, dolphin diving, and rolling while proning. The movement sounds simple, but you can do so much with it. The environment is amazingly crafted, as you can use your different forms of movement to take alternate paths to the main objective (and the movement system it just enjoyable overall). 

My only gripe with the game is the base building system *when you first start playing*. It honestly felt cumbersome and out of place, as you needed to constantly extract soldiers to get develop better items and weapons, feeling like 70% of the game was extracting and base management, with the rest being actually playing the game. But, once you start progressing further into the game, expanding and managing motherbase becomes an amazing system that really adds to the whole experience that is MGSV.

[i]Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain[/i], with a seductive title, it's a strategic stealth game. Set in Cyprus, Afghanistan and Zaire-Angola, we'll personify the character Venom Snake —who will have other pennames such as Big Boss— after the incidents occurred in [i]Ground Zeroes[/i]. Our character wakes up in the hospital after nine years in a coma. Without an arm and with shrapnel in his head, he will soon escape (with the help of Ishmael) pursuit by the «Cipher» organization and «Quiet». We'll breakout from the hospital but before we see the superhuman on our way: the «Third Child» and the «Man on Fire». After an arduous chase, Snake will arrive at a place where Revolver Ocelot will save him, to take him to the new Mother Base located on the island of Seychelles. We'll meet with Miller and the Diamond Dogs mercenary organization.

Once we rescue Miller from captivity, we'll have information on the person behind our pursuit. Skull Face: the antagonist who is working with Huey Emmerich; both are developing a new metal gear named «Sahelanthropus». In our mission in Africa after freeing Eli, we will find information about the development of a parasite that affects English-speaking people. The game has two progressive outcomes: the first involves revenge against Skull Face, such as stopping superhumans like his plans against the world, and seizing the metal gear. The second denouement consists of the parasite unleashed by Huey at Mother Base and the rescue of Quiet.

Writing a review of one of Hideo Kojima's works requires understanding the game's plot theses. The construction of the dialogues are symbolic, allegorical and other times with a noteworthy content in terms of narrative and philosophical questions. It has an assorted semantics and plays a lot with the [i]meanings of the language[/i]. This is seen precisely in intentionality within the script: each one says, comments, narrates, speaks, talks and all the actions of voice and word. In this way, Kojima introduces various problems, something that is usually seen in many of his games. As in this case, a central theme is English as the language that rules the world and about identity of belonging to a land and personality. 

At least for me, many well-developed characters take influences from various expressions of art. Combined with its cinematographic talent, an interactive film, with opposite scenes between jungle and desert, beautiful graphics, it offers the possibility of understanding and interpretation. We also find diversity of flora and fauna, as well as weather. The game allows us to go beyond the gameplay, the narration and even the interaction itself that permits something in us to feel and think.

[b]Playability[/b] 9/10

The world of this game changed from its predecessors. Now we will play in an open world. We have that freedom to complete non-linear missions, to escape linear progression nodes just like in the previous games. The narrative is the substance of the game. The gameplay helps to understand the narrative. For that, completing a secondary and primary mission requires exploration to obtain resources with which it will be sent to the Mother Base.

We'll choose the missions while we're in the helicopter. Once we enter the mission, it'll be in a delimited area. We won't be able to walk away until the task is completed. When doing so, a notification of the loss of the signal will appear. Each mission consists mainly of carrying it out through stealth. We will execute hand-to-hand combat and use non-lethal weapons. There are basic game actions, such as: crouching, knocking down, interrogating, slumbering, walking on the ground, and others more related to stealth. If the mission is completed mainly through stealth and without many deaths, we will get bonuses in currency and heroism. We can capture enemies, animals, vehicles and resources through the Fulton. Thus, each mission consists of recognition, gathering information, collecting resources and establishing strategies.

We will be managing our Mother Base. It is a place where we can train, assign personnel for a certain task and research, and develop weapons as well as equipment or armour. Each development has a cost. The money will be obtained in the missions. Each mission has a rank. The higher that, the better the pay. We can also send soldiers to other places and earn money. Without forgetting that we have transport and companions: from our horse, the dog and Quiet respectively. Each of them will help us in combat. The game has many gameplay mechanics. Some are familiar from its previous games, such as the classic sound when the enemy is detected. And others are new, like Snake's electric cigarette with which he allows time to pass. Just like weather conditions help stealth. Stealth is the most important action.

[b]Music and FX[/b] 10/10

The game's soundtrack is composed in two ways. The first consists of an orchestral work. The second, the songs are on the tapes as collectibles within the game and can be played. The main theme of the game is the concept of [i]phantom pain in the Big Boss personality[/i]. That will be better understood when we comprehend the conclusion. The orchestral soundtrack was composed by several composers: Ludvig Forssell, Justin Burnett and Harry Gregson Williams mainly. The composition is a rich mixture of electronic style tones with orchestral music like from a movie amalgamated with atonality and classic minimalism. The music is sometimes heroic, tragic, epic, dark, theatrical; a work of art in the style of the avant-garde. Each musical piece narrates what will happen in the story, with which it helps to reinforce the filmic drama. It allows one to feel and understand the diversity of tensions caused by each piece that fits perfectly with the narrative event.

The other part of the soundtrack found on the audio tapes. These can be located in certain places and missions. The bands make it up are part of the musical movements between the 80s and 90s. So we can replay them at any time of our journey. Some of these bands are: a-ha, The Cure, Joy Division, Europe or Laura Branigan, to name a few.  With this inserted music, which contrasts the environmental sounds, it concedes a contextual immersion, like rock music in the Vietnam War or the Afghan War. In fact, as a footnote, this idea will be taken up again in Hojima's game, [i]Death Stranding[/i], whose songs highlight the human feeling in the face of loneliness.

[b]Duration[/b] 10/10

Few games have unfathomable content, just like the open possibility of unfolding the gameplay. Along with [i]Bioshock[/i] or [i]Detroit: Become Human[/i], this game becomes a work with philosophical content and with a deep narrative. The game is transformed into a work that is carefully appreciated. If we only see the gameplay, of course, the duration is very long: it requires exploration, collecting resources and completing missions.  It also has a player versus player mode, it consists of protecting the mother base.  As there are also hard difficulty missions, repeated, to discover the fate of Quiet and an unexpected ending. If we want to constantly talk about this game, it's worth diving in countless times.

Gameplay-wise, probably the best the series has to offer. A few open worlds with missions to conduct and side operations to take on, you have no shortage of things to do and means to get them done. 

As with most Metal Gear games in the franchise, stealth and non-lethal gameplay is slightly more favorable but you're never discouraged from going all out with a wide variety of guns and instruments both lethal and less-than-lethal. The biggest feature of the game, despite all the fun you can do on your own, is managing an army of soldiers as your own private militia. Capture and recruit people, steal resources and build your base of operations, develop more tools with that and so forth. You'll be scouting the battlefield for useful people to snag and bring back to base almost as much as you'll be creeping around achieving your objectives. FOB invasions and defenses bring a whole other level to army management as you can intrude on other player's bases and defend your own. Motherbase will always be safe, but your forward operating bases are not and can be subject to players taking stuff from there. Likewise, you can do the same or even launch a counter offensive potentially. It can be fun from time to time, but also optional with no necessary need to build them to complete the game.

The story...is admittedly the weakest part of the game in my opinion. Good in some chapters and less so in others, not bad but kinda forgettable antagonist that makes the missions that focus more on Snake and his growing army the highlights of the game's story.",1675819338,1675819338,True,8,0,0.584935426712036133,0,True,False,False

I've been playing Metal Gear Solid since Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, I'm not as old school as Metal Gear for the NES and I wasn't really old enough to play Metal Gear Solid 1 on the PS1 but I've been following the franchise since more or less 2004, so I know what to expect out of a Metal Gear game for the most part.

Firstly, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is probably the best third person stealth game currently on the market, in terms of stealth and I'm really stressing that word here. The AI is good enough so that if you're being stupid you'll get caught but if you're smart you'll definitely feel like you've earned it.

The story takes place after the events of Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes, which was a strange little piece of a game where it was more or less a demo but acted more as a prologue to the story that is the Phantom Pain. Although overall the story is the same as what we've grown to expect. ""Nukes Bad, Russia Bad, America kinda good but also bad."" The story is good enough to keep you going but like most Kojima games, there are times where cutscenes take a bit too long and exposition becomes tedious.

As said before, the stealth in this game is great, infiltrating bases and outposts and taking people out stealthily or just being a ghost is absolutely the best way to experience this game. It's one of the few stealth games you can play where it actually makes you feel like a proper commando. 

However the gunplay is also very tight, getting into shootouts is fun in this game, even though you might not want to be doing that; it's good that its satisfying and not clunky and weird like in previous installments. If you want to play the game guns-blazing, absolutely go for it.

You have a base to manage to get upgrades, different pods as well, Intel can give you more intel as you're on the move, such as telling you where enemies are, R&D so you can make cool new weapons and gadgets to make things easier for situations, Medical Bay to help make tranq weapons as well as discharge your men from the sick bay earlier. It's a fun little mini game and luckily the game doesn't throw it all at you at once and introduces it bit by bit so that you're not overwhelmed. I feel this is definitely a positive as there are some games that just throw all their gimmicks and services at you right at the beginning and you find yourself ignoring them.

The buddy system is great, for me, Quiet and D-Dog are absolutely the two best you can take, the best part about the buddy system is that unlike some stealth games, having someone with you doesn't mean they'll be seen if you move too quickly. Quiet (Sniper) tends to perch up way out of sight and D-Dog doesn't get seen at all when he's with you unless you're super close, but even then, the soldiers just treat him like a dog and tell him to shoo. Your stealth experience will absolutely not be hindered by taking a buddy. This is a massive bonus to bringing people along with you, more games should do it like this. 

A major criticism I have of the game is the ranking system per mission and there are a few reasons why. You get a higher rank the stealthier you are, that makes sense and that's totally fair but it does mean that if people want to go in guns blazing, they lose rank.

Furthermore the stuff in the R&D development, for guns and other gadgets, all the really cool stuff is all Lethal weapons. There are so few choices for going non-lethal that it's absurd, it's at least 80:20 in favour of lethal. This means you'll end up using a similar loadout for most of the game. Don't get me wrong, I understand from a realistic standpoint Revolver Ocelots pistols should be lethal, but I feel every single gun in the game (Excluding maybe rocket launchers) should have a stun or tranq alternative. All the gun stuff means you need to go loud and lethal and thus, get a lower rank at the end of the mission.

However it's not all bad in that sense, what I did discover is that rank for missions (Which I'd recommend getting an A or an S as you get rewards for doing so) only counts for actual story missions or ""Episodes."" So the way I had my gun was. If it's a story/episode mission, full stealth, I am Venom Snake, I am unseen and when I might get seen, I take them down slowly and put them to sleep. If it's a side mission? Use all your fun stuff. You're not ranked on a side op, so just go in with all the stuff you want to use, the revolvers, the light machine guns, the rocket launchers, the assault rifles. It's definitely the best way to make use of the lack of tranq and stun weapons if you're wanting to use lethal weapons.

Some missions are, like in most games, just horrible with no checkpoints for absolutely no reason. This was one of the main issues I had with Ace Combat 7. There are missions where you're on a timer, need to destroy a bunch of stuff, then when the mission is effectively done, you can opt to destroy a few more targets for a bonus. If you die during this bonus optional part of the mission, you are back at square one. You restart the -whole- mission. I don't really get why this is, because if I've just sank twenty minutes into doing the main objectives, only to die to something, why do I need to do the base mission again? Why can't I start from the bonus to that job? Just seems like a weird oversight to me.

Overall, I can see why some people don't really view this as a Metal Gear Solid game, it doesn't play like the others and plays a bit more Splinter-Cell instead. But I don't see what they could have done if they wanted to make it open world. This is the best way to make an Open-World Metal Gear Solid game, I just think there's a few things that needed tweaked and fixed and this would've been the best one. For me, Snake Eater is till top of the food chain.

7/10, enjoyed the stealth aspects and story but wouldn't play it more than once, and in all honesty I'd probably tell someone to play Snake Eater instead.",1675813770,1675813770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Metal Gear Solid 1 is the third game in the metal gear series and the 7th game in order of the timeline. It takes place six years after Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake is a secret agent that has to Infiltrate Shadow Moses, which is a secret base that was captured by Foxhound, which is holding the United States hostage for the remains of Big Boss, who is the same guy as Solid Snake expect with an eye-patch. Solid Snake, not Big Boss, sneaks into the air vent to save the DARPA chief, but he dies, so you fight a man named Revolver Ocelot. But, your duel is interrupted by a mysterious ninja called Grey fox, a man named Frank Jaeger who used to be in foxhound but then defected to Zanzibar land because he was in love with a former figure skater from Czechoslovakia. because he is a robot, he has to cut off Revolver Ocelot’s hand. Then Snake finds a peeing man named Otocan, the son of a famous scientist who killed himself because his second wife cheated on him with his son. You see, Otocan father, Hal Emmerich, built metal gear Zeke for Naked snake and then Metal Gear Sahelanthropus for a man called Skull Face. This is why Otocan builds a super secret robot called Metal Gear Rex for a man called Liquid Snake, a clone of Solid Snake created from the DNA of Big Boss, also known as Naked Snake, who is both of their fathers, and he has an eyepatch. Solid snake is tricked into activating metal gear because Campbell thought miller was not Liquid Snake, but he was; it turns out revolver ocelot was actually a double agent the entire time and was secretly working for the third snake brother called Solidus Snake, who is also the president of the United States and has a doctor octopus suit with flamethrowers on it. He has an eye-patch. Are you following me so far? Next we have metal gear solid 2 this is were things start to get a little confusing 2 years after shadow Moses solid snake jumps onto a boat where he is confronted by revolver ocelot and it turns out he is now possessed by spirt of liquid snake because he grafted liquids arm onto his body so now ocelot is voiced acted by the voice actor for liquid snake and he blows up the entire boat and steals a all new robot called metal gear RAY then 2 years later the new president is taken hostage by the old president so the colonel sends in snake who is actually Raiden who is apart of foxhound but not the old version a new one turns out snake is the leader of the terrorists but not the real solid snake who is now know as Pliskin you see after you rescue the president he reveals that the entire democratic process is actually a sham staged by a secret organization called “The Patriots” who rule the United States from the shadows turns out big shell is actually a facade merely to conceal a super secret robot fortress hidden beneath it called arsenal gear which houses a power AI called GW which allows the patriots sensor and control the sense and flow of the information to stop GW Raiden teams up with Otocan sister who is killed by a vampire after they upload the virus to arsenal gear the colonel tells Raiden to turn the game off because he was actually a AI construct that was created by GW the entire time Raiden then has to fight 25 metal gear RAYS on foot with a pistol after the battle liquid ocelot reveals that he was actually a triple agent working for the patriots all along turns out the entire video game of metal gear solid 2 was orchestrated by the patriots to simulate the events of metal gear solid 1 so Raiden could get good army training ocelot is once again possessed by the spirit of liquid snake which declares that he is reverse quadruple agent who will destroy the patriots and jumps off a building then for no reason the AI colonel contacts Raiden and reveals that GW was only one of many AI developments by the patriots the true purpose of the simulation was to serve as a microcosm to society enter into the digital age the patriots were considered about the arrival of the internet and that humanity would become too fixated on trivial information like overly complicated video game story lines then we have metal gear solid 3 which is set 41 years before metal gear solid 1. Big Boss is betrayed by the Boss, who is a different person. Still, he doesn’t know that she was pretending to defect to Russia because the United States told her to do that so she could be a scapegoat for the Cold War. After being thrown off a bridge, Snake is tasked with destroying an early metal gear prototype called Shagohod, eliminating colonel Volgin, who has lightning powers and the boss with whom he is in love. He has to steal a secret microfilm which is worth 100 Billion Dollars. He teams up with a woman called Eva, also known as Tatyana and Matka Pluku and Big Mama, who is Solid Snake's mother who, in a shocking twist, is actually revealed to be a double agent working for China. She steals the microfilm, but it is a fake in metal gear solid five you play as venom snake.......... Metal Gear Solid 4 the real colonel brings solid snake out of retirement for the 4th time even though he is now 200 years old his mission is to stop liquid ocelot once and for all the only problem is that all the metal gears have now merged with the technology of a cow so he has to meet Drebin who has a little monkey Drebin injects solid snake with nanomachine so that he can shoot guns and learns that liquids new plan is too use big bosses biometric data as a key to take soul command of the patriots firearms control system the vampire working for liquid then throws big bosses comatose body into a fire because he forgot what the storyline was then everybody goes back to shadow Moses where liquid reveals his new battleship called outer heaven which is the name of the secret base where solid snake blew up big boss with a rocket launcher 19 years ago Snake sneaks into the core of outer heaven which is actually a modified version of arsenal gear and installs a secret virus that disables the entire AI perpetrated by the patriots this deactivating all weapons and the entire world but turns out this was all apart of liquid ocelots plan the entire time you see he was never was actually possessed by liquid snake he merely used hypnotherapy to make himself think that he was his true goal all along was to achieve world peace but also he wants to fight solid snake in a brawl to the death you see big boss was actually revolver ocelots greatest friend and idol even though he killed his Mom during they’re fight ocelot is exposed to the Foxdie virus which kills him because it was injected into snake by Drebin even though he should have been exposed to it earlier in the game and died but they forgot and that is the entire story line of Metal Gear Solid 

But then, in a surprise cutscene, it is revealed by a big boss, who is still alive, that every single event in the entire series was fake and staged by the shadow patriots. You see out Eeyore.

Because it runs smothly on my extremely weak PC that cannot run even 3-4 year old games properly. And you know what? It looks better than the PS3 version with all settings set to minimal. I cannot fully convey how happy I am to play this game while away from my consoles and very thankful to the developers team.

As for the game itself. Well... A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME.

That was written by me more than 7 years ago. And it still feels that MGSV is quite a new game. Since than Kojima has already established the new studio, made a new game and even announced the sequel. And yet the Phantom Pain still stays relevant in a meme-infested cesspool that is the Internet. Does it desrve it? It does. Kinda. 

I've loved the series since 2000 or something, MGS1 being my first game (and my favorite out of the bunch). And replaying all of them, I can say that MGSV is a great sandbox stealth game with some funny le quirky Japanese shit which MGS was known for, yet it still doesn't feel too much like an MGS game in many places. There aren't many interesting bossfights, the story is spread very unevenly, the mission structure feels more like a spin-off like Peace Walker (which TPP is a direct sequel of) and not a numbered MGS game that gives you linear well-orchestrated adventure. I feel bad for myself having the same critique for MGS4 because it didn't stick to one location like MG\MGS had done before it. 

Don't want to write a giant copypasta, so here this: it's a great game not for the same reasons previous installments were great. It doesn't take away the fact that there still aren't many games like this on the market.

It combines base building, open world, espionage and tactical infiltration and somehow manages to seriously pull it off while simultanously maintaining an unbeatable story. There are things about the gameplay which make no sense such as how captured enemy soldiers agree to fight for you - the guy who regularly kills their brothers in arms. However, it is the first game in its class that I have seen that allows you to play as you want - full stealth or guns blazing or like me a mixture of the two.

I keep coming back because I miss every Snake, and their absence is a phantom pain. I keep coming back because I remember how great it is to let go and descend into the madness of revenge. I come back because I wish Naked and Solid Snake could have had this level of freedom.

The sandbox style open-world allows for so much experimentation, whether it be with the staggering amount of weapons and gadgets you can unlock, or the responsive environments and AI. Once it all clicks, each mission feels calculable and the ""tactical espionage"" aspect shines. Metal Gear gameplay to me has always been about situational awareness and quick-thinking, two things this game rewards pretty well. It feels especially satisfying to gear up, do recon, and infiltrate a huge base, taking it slow and remaining undetected or having to maneuver your way out of potentially being discovered. Even getting caught can be fun when having to adapt to the AI's alert/search phases, although I do think fighting back can be a little clunky sometimes. The way that the enemy force as a whole reacts to how you play the game is also really cool and adds some variety to playing/replaying missions. Do a lot of missions at night, and the enemies gain flashlights and night vision goggles. If you typically aim for the head, the soldiers get helmets. It's a neat way to make my presence in the game world be felt, and its something I wish more open-world games would do. I'm also a fan of the game's bigger set pieces, especially the areas with multiple paths and levels to traverse (Mfinda Oilfield is a particular favorite). There's also a staggering amount of content in the game, with over 150 side ops, like a million different mission objectives (some of which can only be completed if you replay the mission once you've unlocked some late game gadgets), a whole ZOO to populate with animals, and plenty of unlockable items to get. However, the side ops can get repetitive though, with a lot of the later ones boiling down to extracting/exploding tanks and getting rid of soldiers in full armor. Replayability is really encouraged with this game which is a huge plus for me. In fact, at the time of writing I'm [i] still [/i] trying to squeeze as much time as I can out of this game. Watching the completion percentage the game displays in your helicopter base go up is really addicting.

I think the story gets a lot of flack, understandably so considering that the story itself is light, somewhat confusing and the cutscenes can be so few and far between. I saw someone say that it feels like the narrative is in a state of always feeling like its about to get good and it just never really hits, which I would kind of agree with. But I think whats here works well enough to act as the middle link between the Big Boss/Solid Snake eras (and to be honest I'm a little biased because after playing MGS4, a Metal Gear game thats more focused on gameplay is welcome). Despite all that, I wouldn't say the story is [i] bad, [/i] just not finished and not the main focus. There's some neat fan service moments and the good old Metal Gear memetics are all there. The cutscenes that are in the game are well-directed and stylish with some really memorable moments, and it certainly helps that the game is drop-dead gorgeous.

The original soundtrack is full of John Carpenter-esque, cinematic synth tracks that dynamically change as you sneak around. The licensed soundtrack is filled to the brim with time-appropriate bangers too (even though theres that one song by the Cure that came out like ten years after the game is supposed to take place lol). I do wish there were some more songs from the Metal Gear series as more little collectible tapes, which I think are really fun especially when you zoom with your binoculars and hear a split-second of Hall and Oates in the distance and picking it up becomes a little side note in your mission.

Everyones already said it but yeah it really sucks that the second half of this game is so blatantly unfinished. There's only a handful of original missions after the first half of the game is over, with a lot of reused missions with some sort of modifier on it, and most of the modifiers just kind of boil down to don't get caught or don't get shot. The story kind of just doesn't fully resolve either, although I'd consider the game to have a few endings to certain plotlines, it never feels like it gives as strong of a final send-off like MGS4 does. With some more time, who knows what a full second chapter or even a third would have been like. 

Overall, this game really makes me appreciate what I love about playing the Metal Gear games and it reminds me just how much I miss these games. Everything feels like its designed around the idea of letting you be cool and cinematic, and the non-linear sandbox gameplay makes for some really organic, exciting situations. There's a part where Big Boss says [i] ""Anyone here can use a knife or a gun. What you're going to learn is how to use your head""[/i], and I think it kinda summarizes what its like to really get into this game.

200 Hour Edit: This is still the best of the series and probably in my top 3 games. I'm now throwing this game on when I'm talking to friends or just hanging out, and it's a fantastic timekiller. Now that I understand the AI through and through, there are so many interesting situations that you can fix yourself into, and yet it doesn't feel like I'm smarter than the game, but rather that I'm smarter than the enemy, which fits thematically.",1667873605,1675062183,True,2,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

As a Metal Gear Solid fan, I can't recommend this game enough although story-wise it's missing a lot of the exposition and cinematic cutscenes that the series is known for, so for that I can't recommend it as a starting point into the series. 

However, the whole game has this sort of 70s serial vibe where each mission is split up into ""episodes"" where they all have this short but sweet sort of objective based gameplay that takes multiple tries to finish completely, giving you loads of replay value. These episodes are tied together with cinematic scenes that give you insight into the lore of the present and the past of Mother Base and Venom Snake. Leading you to a grand finale that is shocking for what it takes to get there. 

Gameplay is smooth, fluid and very satisfying to get down to a science. At the start of the game you are given only the bare minimum but through leveling up your team via the Mother Base meta game, you can use your crew to develop more powerful and unique weapons that can be customized to bring you a unique arsenal of weaponry.

MGS is best played as a stealth game, it's the nature of the game. 

Very well optimized video game. Runs smooth AF, looks pretty good on low settings, so I am told.

The story, is pretty Kojima-like. If you don't know what that means, then, it's kinda wild, I guess.

-------------FOR NON MGS PLAYERS:

IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DISREGARD THE ENTIRE STORY, FIND THIS ON A SALE, AND JUST WANT NICE GAMEPLAY, get the game 100% AND MOD THE FUCK OUT OF IT.

If you wanna get invested just for this game you still need to play Snake Eater and Peace Walker, there used to be a PC port of the HD collection here but CERTAIN COMPANY removed it.

--------------WE BEGIN. SPOILERS AHEAD.

From the legacy collection to rising only to end here. This game is a bloody mess in a good and a bad way, while at the same time, having so much of its gameplay ruined by Konami's decisions.

--------------GAMEPLAY

Best in the franchise* by a long shot. Kojipro has a level of obsession with detail that could rival Rockstar's. You can either mess around in the sandbox like a dumbass or become the legendary soldier. Playing as snake has NEVER felt this amazing, smooth, detailed and reactive.

The open world feels like it isn't fully taken advantage of with what is a downgrade from the side ops Peace Walker had.

PW wasn't THAT excellent either, given that nearly half the missions were just ""fight this bullet sponge boss except harder"". The fact that The Phantom Pain manages to be worse than that is disappointing.

Main missions are a bit better but the need to add filler in the form of alternate difficulties and random missions with no story consequence feels lame.

The companion mechanic is a blessing.
--Horse: good for travel n shoot. Your first mate, it's trusty for the beginning.
--D-Dog: busted. It's having a built-in radar. Wanna cheese stealth? bring him in. BUT HE'S STILL THE GOODEST OF BOYOS.
--D-Walker: the level of costumization it has allows it to be adaptable as fuck.
--Quiet: busted. Get her the Wicked Butterfly, she can straight up clear an entire camp on her own. I'd say though, the tranq rifle is good but later on every mf has armor and helmet, so she's useless.

-------------STORY

Miller gets to be a hypocrite for later finding out ""boss betrayed me how could he"" even tho he betrayed him first on the secret tape you find all the way in the post game end of PW.

We also have paz. Very sad way to give her character closure but i liked it a lot. Chico dying off screen with Amanda paying no fucks about it past a ""im ready for the worse"" was depressing. Huey is a FUCKING CUNT so that's nice, it's twist villain, BUT IT MAKES STRANGELOVE FEEL SO UNDERUTILIZED, SHE DESERVED BETTER. I already didn't like how she ends with Huey at the end of PW so out of nowhere.

Ocelot is good, it genuinely felt like he was being his most real self in this game. Other than that i respect kojima for bringing back again the original voice actors from Peace Walker, and even Major Zero himself.

Those audios genuinely felt so nice 'cause before this we saw nothing of him between SE and GotP, only heard bad things. In these audios he felt genuinely human who cared for Snake despite of it all. He pretty much saved his ass, which is why it PAINS ME that all of this is given in audios. The one moment where cutscenes would've been so nice and it was wasted.

Volgin coming back makes no sense whatsoever but neither does XOF and skullface. We didn't need a 3rd party in the ""the Boss's dream"" debacle. Zero and Boss were enough. Psycho Mantis is here for fanservice but at least it isn't as in-your-face as with GotP.

I like Quiet, i like the story she could've had but i guess Kojima was too busy believing his own bs excuse for making her semi naked. I don't mind fanservice but kojima my man just be honest.

100% bond her then spend time in the ACC with her, then come back and justify me the poses she makes. Is she a badass? yes. Is she amazing mechanically speaking? fuck yes, is she entertaining? yes. Is she on the same level of depth as other characters in the franchise? (specially female ones) LMAO NO.

Code Talker imo is the standout of this roaster of new TPP characters. His audios were genuinely fascinating to listen to.

Kojima didn't wanna make this but since he had to, i guess the next step after PW was finding a way to connect it with the original NES Metal Gears, and the result is this whole psyops mess of double agent thing. Im not gonna call it bad but it shows that the man feels done already with the IP, so i wont give it much crap, 'cause all things considered i did have my fun ('cause i had previous investment from the ENTIRE franchise.)

---------------------------FUCK KONAMI

Now the fun part, the part where i massacre the shit out of this game, not due to its own faults, but for the BULLSHIT konami implemented to WORSEN it compared to PW.

1: FUCK FORCED ONLINE. You like FOBs? more power to you, have fun, i do believe the concept is interesting with good potential save for the nukes, which instead of being a deterrent just paint a bullseye on you saying ""invade me"". You like the idea of having your shit stolen against your will 'cause a sweatlord felt like it? No? Fuck you.

2: FUCK THE CHALLENGE REWARDS. They artificially fuck up the progression. In PW i never saw an S rank until WAY later. In here? way too early. You simply get too much for nothing...BUT WAIT.

3: FUCK THE BASE MANAGEMENT. Konami knew this, so that's why they made everything cost the MOST OBNOXIOUS AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES AND MONEY POSSIBLE. Wanna speed it up? Sure, do FOBs and online or go fuck yourself.

4: FUCK COMBAT DEPLOYMENT. They ruined them. In PW i could send all S ranks and have guaranteed success with no deaths. Now i could throw all S++ ranks on a stupid normal mission and still fail 'cause lol.

5: FUCK THE ONLINE MISSIONS AND ITEMS. You play games to have fun, right? fuck you, this is a job now. Developing or completing those takes ACTUAL FUCKING DAYS, UP TO 12 OF THEM. Not only that, they demand such a disgusting amount of resources it FORCES you to play online if you want that many resources. As for the CD, they don't even give you that much anyways so you just waste your time and units.

6: FUCK MICROTRANSACTIONS. Wanna speed up the long dev time? sure! buy me some coins and you might be able to speed up a 12 day wait for only 50$!

7: FUCK ONLINE MODE. Simple, if you play offline, 90% if your shit goes to an online only bank.

Raising the level of a unit used to give you perks like speeding up development in R&D. that's worth fuck all. Not only that, you can only develop 4 ONLINE WEAPONS AT THE SAME TIME. Wanna speed it up? MTS. Wanna unfuck the gameplay? MTS. Wanna recover seeing S+ and S++ soldiers in the wild? (something THAT WAS THERE, but konami removed it and made it online only to get 'em). SPEND AND JOIN OUR SWEAT SHOP.

FORCED ONLINE IS NEVER OK. I DON'T CARE THAT SOME WEAPONS ARE TOO MUCH FOR SINGLE PLAYER, I WANT THEM, IM ENTITLED TO THEM. I GOT EVERY SINGLE WEAPON IN PEACE WALKER BECAUSE I WANTED TO, EVEN IF SOME WERE CO-OP ONLY. THAT'S MY CHOICE.

The review remains positive. I had my fun, gameplay is good, the port and engine was optimized by gods and they deserve heaven 'cause i shouldn't have been able to play this so well on my rig, something that deserves praise in an industry full of incompetent devs and money hungry publishers. Also it has a modding scene which GREATLY unfucks the gameplay by boosting your resources a lot and allows you to get better units, among many other things. I should've used them from day 1.

I can now uninstall this game and leave this ""grind work""..and put the entire franchise to rest forever..

Kinda sad to see this legendary franchise go down like this, but that's the phantom pain every fan will carry from now on. It was a beautiful ride all things considered, and it shall be remembered. 

Thank you for everything kojima!

Yes the game looks visually stunning, but there's a soft wall you hit that suddenly slows the game down to a crawl. This game has a lot of ambitions, but has a lot of content obviously cut or rushed to meet its deadline.

First up, the monetization. This game gets past the tutorial slowly, but once it does you find out the real game is a practice in how much psychological manipulation you're able to withstand. The first maybe 10 hours you put into the game you don't feel it. Yeah, Konami turned snake's tuxedo into DLC instead of being an unlockable item, but the story and open world missions don't require that much beyond what you can acquire in-game. Then you start developing more and more weapons and parts for your base, and that's when Konami's greedy hands start tapping on your shoulder with mandatory wait times. The offline timers can only be progressed thru waiting, but by giving Konami your hard earned money, you can get MOTHER BASE COINS (Yay!!!!) and skip the timers! In fact, if you feel like you gather resources at a too-slow a rate, then guess what? mOrE mOtHeR bAsE cOiNs!@!@!@! Buy more resources (but through a circuitous way as to not break laws) so you can build MORE mother bases! Everywhere, the entire ocean can be filled with Mother Bases Paid For By Mother Base Coins!

And if you delete your save and never go online? You'll lose your previous mother bases and start it ALL OVER AGAIN!!! Which may or may not be illegal, but is definitely pissing in the wallets of your consumers.

Next the gameplay. It's tight and responsive (when it works) and can be extremely exciting and fast paced (when you find it). There's so much stuff you can do, and all of the goofy Metal Gear elements are found thru experimenting with different tactics and weapons. The way the AI will counter your tactics as the game progresses keeps the battlefield feeling fresh and gives the player a constantly evolving threat to try and deal with. The gunplay is so fun, and if you like to shoot to kill, this game will reward you with viscerally juicy headshots, and knocking people back 5 feet with a shotgun is never not entertaining. It just doesn't get stale, you have so many tools at your disposal, and if you need to change to fit a new fighting style, you can do that and... wait around for a box to... Well, if you're experienced with Metal Gear, you'll find ways to exploit the AI and there's MULTIPLE ways to cop-out of a situation if you're ill-equipped for it, usually. The sound design too!!! So many of the weapons just have a  There are story missions where you're required to fight things a certain way, but aside from that, it's not just the world that's open, it's your mind. As you experiment, you find new ways of dealing with the landscape around you and become the big cheese himself, the Big Boss. Except...

Well here we are again talking about the monetization... Again, you need to wait. The majority of my time was just spent waiting in this game. Not in the open world, no, but just sitting in a helicopter, waiting for timers. Really, it should be labelled an ""idle game"" because about 50% of the time in this game, just sitting around, waiting for your soldiers to work for you is the best way to gain money, especially in the post-game, and especially if you don't want to engage with the online stuff. Most of my hours were spent with the game just sitting idly on my desk while I did chores, made food, rolled up, went for a shower, bullshit like that. Yeah, you can obviously just pass the time doing combat missions, but who has that kind of time to devote to a video game? Honestly, with how much waiting was baked into the way the game plays, it makes sense why the story is the way it is. 

Jesus it's a mess. If you don't listen to what essentially boils down to a geopolitical podcast hosted by Diamond Dogs, you'll skip past 70% of the story. Like with Peace Walker, they couldn't fit all of the story into cutscenes, so instead it's delivered thru audio logs you get. You can listen to them either on mission (which helps fill the otherwise silent background of the open world) or (guess what) in the copter, waiting out those timers. There's all the usual Kojima-isms, and fans of him will be delighted to comb through at their own leisure, but if you don't listen to them as they come, then the story feels like a really long cable, with two explosions of exposition, that just kind of piddlefarts out at the end, leaving an unresolved story.

Graphics are good. Obviously. It's a Kojima game. All of his games are visually stunning, and I will fight you if you say that any game other than MGS3 is the best looking game on PS2, and I've only encountered stutter when running it with like, 12 tabs of firefox, torrent software, and discord, for the most part it's solid. 

The online exists. Maybe it's good, maybe it sucks.

It genuinely doesn't feel like a Metal Gear game mainly because of the lack of David Hayter and the charm that made the other games so great.

Pros:
Looks amazing even today,
Mod support.

Cons:
Unfinished with no proper conclusion,
No David Hayter as Snake,
Recycles characters from better MGS games (Volgin, Psychomantis & Liquid),
Technology is somehow more advanced than that in MGS1 which hurts continuity,
Quiet's design is just coom material and nothing more,
It's about FOUR TIMES as long as most of the other MGS games and you bet the gameplay gets repetitive,
Lack of an actual good villian,
Snake says nothing the whole game,
99% of chapter 2 are missions you've already done,
60FPS cap.

And remember, we got this trash instead of Silent Hills.

The Online Invasion mode for the game is Pay-To-Win or ""Play Early on and charge real money to your account. If you get to a certain rank, every player has a decked out base with the highest level of guards.
The Online Subsistence mode this time around revolves around 3 things: Explosives, the ""Bait Mine"", and having access to the Heroes. Played it for a while, but the player base was small at the time.

•Every time Venom stares in silence.

Sometimes it can be self aware and even a bit camp, but for the most part it's just Hideo jerking himself off.

Gameplay wise there's 20-30 good hours to be had here, which can be greatly extended through side ops and enjoying the free roam. However the game just drags on for way too long, and after 20 or so missions the game forces itself to be more bullshit to keep up with your development projects. This results in an awkward mission state where trying to play stealthily/slowly incurs huge risk and wastes an hour of your time, yet you can simply drive straight through the middle of everyone in a jeep and S rank most missions. 

Missions 12, 21 and 45 are particularly egregious, but I do accept half the fun comes in beating these missions in the cheesiest/dumbest way possible.

If you have the spare time and get this on sale then despite its flaws it's definitely worth buying, Quiet's tits are also magnificent which does help you get through the latter slog of the game.",1674017655,1674017655,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

i was constantly walking around my rig waiting to here an excerpt from his ""12 rules for life"" or maybe another one of his famous works but i just couldn't find it.

If you ignore the fact that it's an MGS game it's actually quite good. The story's subpar and everyone already knows it was never finished but the actual gameplay is fun. It found that balance between typical third person combat and classic sneaking that helps sell the feeling of guerilla warfare. It's still leans more into the action than the stealth so it's not the best MGS gameplay in the series. But hey, atleast now you can go full Rambo like you always wanted to in Snake Eater.

The Infinite Heaven mod also adds customizable parameters for how the bad guys spot you, meaning that you can also make it as realistic as you want. Overall it's worth a playthrough.",1673571542,1673571542,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is famous for its long, slow opening sequence that often turned a lot of players away, but boy, after you make it past that it's probably the best Stealth-Action Military game ever made after its predecessor Peace Walker on the PSP (I beat that too, long ago). This game is all about the game-play, and freedom of choice on every mission. The story isn't complete, as in it doesn't have a real ending, and that's because of Konami kicking Kojima from the project, really grinds my gears, but that doesn't mean the story it does have isn't good. It's a giant sorta confusing web of a mystery outside of the main objectives, but it is all explained in the end and through collectibles. There are very few problems with the game overall and I think the Devs did a good job of managing the difficulty while also giving methods of bypassing obstacles. It really is my favorite Single-Player game since I have come back to it again and again.

When I first started playing the game, I was simply looking for a new way to pass the time and escape from the real world for a while. Little did I know that I would end up meeting the love of my life on the game and eventually getting married both in the game and in real life.

I met my partner on METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN as we were both members of the same Free Company. We got to know each other through casual conversation and group activities, and soon discovered that we had a strong connection. As we continued to play and spend time together, we decided to pursue a relationship.

The distance between us was initially a challenge as I lived in New Zealand and my partner lived close to 6,000 miles away in Japan, and we were unable to meet in person due to COVID-19 border restrictions. Despite the challenges, we were determined to make our relationship work and spent countless hours talking and playing the game together. Eventually, we decided to get married in the game in a large ceremony with many of our friends in attendance. It was a beautiful and memorable event that we will always cherish.

Due to the pandemic, we were also unable to have a traditional in-person wedding. Instead, we got married over Zoom with our loved ones joining us virtually. It was a unique and unforgettable experience, and we were thrilled to finally become husband and wife.

After the wedding, I was finally able to fly to Japan to meet my partner in person for the first time. It was an incredible moment and marked the beginning of a new chapter in our lives together.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN has brought so much joy and love into my life, and I am forever grateful for the memories and experiences it has given me. The game has an amazing community of players who have become like family to me, and I am grateful to have met my partner through it.

Well Kaz, that's what I was asking my self before I discover this game series. When I first got involved with the greatest work of Kojima, I thought that it was all about the memes. But no. There was, there is and always will be a greater thing about this game series. The anti-war messages, the cinematography, the characters, the story, the music were always perfect in those games. This game is no exception. The passion of Kojima trying to prevent from killing any enemy, by even adding his own self into the game, is something that must be used for even the latest years content creators out there. Over the years, I've come to the point in which i realized that video games are one of the hardest ways to tell a story with a great underlying message. And Kojima actually achieved it on not only one game, but in a series of 5+ plus in it.
So Why are we still here? To see Kojima's work being recognized more and more over the years.
Can't wait for the remastered versions of all the previous Metal Gear Solid games

Unlike its predecessors, which were more linear and plot-heavy, this game continues the story of Big Boss as a direct sequel to Peace Walker both in terms of story and gameplay. The gameplay of Peace Walker has been refined to absolute perfection in MGS V and the missions take place in two massive open-world maps. The game gives you countless tools to complete missions in any way you choose, with the most rewarding and fun approach being a fully stealthy one. Getting to a high ground, marking out enemy units with your binoculars, and carefully planning and executing missions with the numerous tactical options available is extremely satisfying. You can even bring certain buddies with you, such as a doggo that can sniff out enemies and even stun or kill them. And yes, you can pet him too. The base management system from Peace Walker returns, and you can even visit your base, which you couldn't do in PW. The story is decent, although it does have some dips in quality towards the end thanks to Konami not letting Kojima finish the storyline. This is probably the last game in the legendary Metal Gear franchise, and while Konami could continue to milk it, it wouldn't be a true Metal Gear game without Hideo Kojima's touch. If there's one thing I dislike about this game, it's the replacement of David Hayter with Kiefer Sutherland as Snake's voice actor. Other than that, the game is packed with content and is an absolute joy to play. It's a must-play for any fan of the stealth genre. a must play.",1596801389,1673191666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story wise it has its highs and lows but managed to keep me engaged nonetheless. Voice acting, animation, cutscenes are all superb as you'd expect of a Kojima production. It takes itself quite seriously at times but that's always been part of the charm of an MGS game, a sprinkling of comedic humour here and there will have you chuckling.

edit: also MGS was not meant to be an open world game, it is much better suited to the corridors of previous entries, i feel like it hurts the game, it feels like i am just flying in on a helicopter to either kill someone or take something over and over (i completed mission 17, and side missions that pop up until that point), i quit and uninstalled after going through the 1000th camp of enemies, all just to get surprised by a jeep that drove down the road thus killing all my progress through that part of the mission, and i had ZERO desire to do it for a 1001st time

I have cleared the same compound and extracted the same prisoner at the same location numerous times. At least Ubisoft makes me travel around the map and changes the scenery up. Speaking of travel there's no fast travel in this game. You have to call in your helicopter and wait and long time for it to arrive then sit through the animation. I don't know why I can't just open the map and click on a fast travel point! No ultrawide support. I don't like micro managing a ton of staff members. I love the aspect of grinding and upgrading gear. I just hate the way it is done in this game. It's not a terrible game I got it on a pretty big sale.

The Phantom Pain has the best gameplay in any video game far outclassing games like Zelda BOTW, Skyrim, Apex Legends, Batman Arkham etc. It's because it encompasses numerous gameplay elements, making a very organic playing structure - players can be open, or sneaky or make use of both to manage situations against a very intelligent and adaptable enemy AI. 
The Phantom Pain offers a massive library of weapons and gadgets to use, which are progressively unlocked with the story, making previous missions much easier to complete (most missions are replayable), but also giving players the ability to engage the more difficult challenges every mission offers. In addition, players also have battlefield allies, such as a military dog or a female sniper, who can aid the player in different ways, said allies are also heavily customizable.
The game also comes with 2 entirely different multiplayer modes, one as a story related PVP mode and the other as a general multiplayer mode.

While TPP's story and overall narrative is not as top tier as the 5 great games that came before in the series (which are known for revolutionizing video game storytelling), it still delivers a good plot in vivid imagery, with great characters & dialogue, and some of the best ingame cinematics in video gaming. Audio and music are top notch, voice work is superb and the game is very well optimized for both PC and consoles - nary a bug to be seen throughout an entire playthrough.

The story leads the gameplay so no need to fear about ""What the fuck am i supposed to do. Am i playing it right""
Completely generic and normal
Kojima defineltly wasn't on dementia drugs

took 1hr to complete the first mission . I was engaged. didn't know i spent 1 hour. but in a good way. Like it was 1 hr worth of engagement


edit
Well i actually played after the prolouge
my goal was ""Play until i know the fun won't change. they aren't leading me. I am there""
and well

What a joke
Its a regular gun game. It is
The joke is that. Its in the same map. and they just throw missions at you like its IGI from like 1987 ... atleast IGI was a .... Idk.. never played it.. always felt like an asset flip but in those times i guess it was a pioneer of... something........I want to play IGI
ANYWAY
Its that.. but just 1 map
They tell you to go do the thing. you do the thing. and then you get the story through.. idk Cassette? I haven't gotten a cinematic after the start and im not doing generic prodeduaral generation missions just to fucking get the story. 

now idk what everyone was on about with ""kojima has gone crazy after death stranding"" ... Kojima was crazy... nothing changed. Literally no difference between this and Death stranding... PARTICULARLY the gunplay
and also.. now that i think about it.. very particularly the fact that both games give you the option to go lethal..
And both of these games then punish you for choosing the option they gave 

they have this entire Skill tree level thing called research.
dump resources. get new weapons
why
THE FUCK
would i ever go for this. When i'll get my hand slapped for trying it out
not like each weapon has its purpose. They are all same. but its a change in 1 variables <Rate of fire , Range> 
Thats it. not damage ofc. cause greater range = greater damage.

DOES HE KNOW HIS GAME DESIGN?

its an ok stealth game where every problem can be solved by going around the place.... behind it. 
but you can see its hiding its every urge to be a 3rd person shooter


now
why not give it a no
cause its an actual game not a bad shitty toy gaslighting as a game.
""win"" ""loosing""
the design is winning is fun. and loosing pushes you towards winning in a ""learning"" way


well its a story game. and  its one of the only mordern games that isn't ""what's the point""
Its literally just a mission list
level 1 level 2 level 3 level 4 level 4 level 6 upto i beileve level 31.. and then main story over.. yay
then they sort of give you free reign to have fun without being bound to a story
I make it sound so complex
they just added like... Level 32 to level 50. 
and some side missions. 

now i like the idea that its the same ass map so .. there was potential for the idea of learning the terrain and the area
nothing complex just.. Idk
i guess an advantage of knowing the place.
the nostalgia of ""Oh yea this place i had that fight. I might want to try luring enemies into this building again cause i like the color of it... and the door is right next to the stairs and that's the only way in , so its fun to cheese enemies. 

what is the game design of this game?
Hmm if i was making a story game.. and i decided to go level based , but i also wanted ""progression"" so they could buy weapons and shit. And then give them ""housing"" which is just a free roam level..
and then cause the story calls for a cool hero who does cool things he needs cool gadgets and so the gameplay developed into basically ""cool fun gameplay"" where shooting the enemy is fun. animations wise.. not.. cause.. its a game. and you can balloon things back to base which gives a feeling of Hording....if you played skyrim you know how much you would love to use all the things you horded in your inventory after installing the infinite weight mod.
why the fucking attack chopper tho.. Like ..what's the purpose here? tanks and bmps maybe.. AH . thats why the rpgs. 
in a stealth game?
YES.. in a stealth game. cause its  3rd person shooter stealth game.. for fun.
Yup.


OH SHIT
this shit's ""POSING"" was so convoluted i forgot fucking quiet exists. Hell yea.. Fap Material with animations.

anyway
dont buy it cause ""you are curious"" 
if you are curious like me squash that hope like a bug
Its a regular 3rd person shooter with stealth. Like Spinter cell. but the ""Game director"" takes himself far too seriously. 
With a story.. a twisted story

Has a weird vibe that kept pulling me in, but kind of like a train wreck that I can't stop watching.  I guess I was somewhere in between thumbs up and thumbs down, but given that I couldn't make it through it and how many times I sat back and thought ""what were they smoking"" I can't really recommend it.  It could have been so much more.

Honestly, I'm not this games target audience.  I'm an old guy who's been playing RPGs since Zork.  This game was obviously designed for 12 year old boys.  The story was immature, the gameplay was fun at times, but then all of a sudden it would throw something ridiculous at you.  Don't even get me started on the Chicken Hat!

The cinematography is magical, the weapons and gear are all fun to use and all viable, the missions are fun and i love how the missions can be played in different ways and its up to you to choose. The single player is the main attraction, although the fob mode is fun. The online multiplayer is aight but if you're done playing the single player its nice extra content to try out to see if you like. I can't explain how much i love this game so i will just put out all my negative criticisms out instead. I am a very impatient person so the helicopter cutscenes when you leave and enter missions are kinda annoying but you get used to them, the first mission is a little slow but it gets better and is a nice introduction and people complain about the lengthy cutscenes but i think theyre great and can hold my attention. the online multiplayer is kinda lame imo and its a little dead. the fob events are nice because you can get cosmetics for the single player game but i got a little bored of it after a while.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Kojima Productions and released in 2015. It is the ninth main installment in the METAL GEAR series, and the final one to be directed by series creator Hideo Kojima. The game follows the story of Big Boss, a mercenary leader who is seeking revenge against those who destroyed his private military organization.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The gameplay in THE PHANTOM PAIN is a mix of stealth and action, with an emphasis on open-world exploration. Players can use a variety of weapons and gadgets to take down enemies, as well as the ability to sneak around and use stealth to avoid combat altogether. The controls are smooth and responsive, making it easy to execute precise movements and actions.

One of the standout features of THE PHANTOM PAIN is the Mother Base system, which allows players to build up their own private military organization and recruit soldiers from the battlefield. Players can also use the Fulton Recovery System to extract enemy soldiers and equipment, which can then be used to upgrade and expand Mother Base.

I didn't encounter any major bugs or glitches during my time with the game, although there were some minor issues with the AI at times.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
The story in THE PHANTOM PAIN is complex and deep, touching on themes of revenge, loyalty, and the cost of war. As Big Boss, players must navigate through a series of missions that take them all over the world, from Afghanistan to Africa. Along the way, they will encounter a cast of memorable characters, each with their own motivations and agendas.

The pacing of the story is well-done, with a mix of action-packed missions and quieter moments of character development. The voice acting is top-notch, with strong performances from the cast, particularly Kiefer Sutherland as Big Boss.

[h1]Graphics and Sound:[/h1]
The graphics in THE PHANTOM PAIN are stunning, with detailed environments and character models. The game runs smoothly, with no major issues with frame rate or resolution. The sound design is also excellent, with a great soundtrack and realistic sound effects. The voice acting, as mentioned earlier, is excellent and helps to bring the characters to life.

[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]
There is a lot of replay value in THE PHANTOM PAIN, with a variety of unlockable weapons, items, and costumes. The Mother Base system also gives players a reason to keep coming back, as they can continue to expand and upgrade it over time.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Overall, I highly recommend METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN to fans of the series and newcomers alike. The gameplay is satisfying, the story is engaging, and the graphics and sound are top-notch. The game's themes of revenge and the cost of war are handled well and add depth to the story. The replay value is also strong. If you're a fan of stealth action games, this is a must-play.",1614972223,1672335002,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm sure there's not much to say that hasn't already been said about a years-old game. The gameplay is where this game shines. This is one of those games I wish I could play for the first time again because I started out playing really cautiously and have worked up to playing quickly and efficiently. I'm still learning new things several playthroughs in (like that cutscenes can be paused with the stance button--X on a PlayStation controller).
Again, the game's years old, and you can get it cheap during a sale. If you're interested in action stealth and can stomach graphic violence in the cutscenes and (optionally) in the gameplay, try it out. Oh yeah, mods can help fix some of the game's more glaring issues or annoyances (whatever you think those are).",1672295065,1672295065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Motherbase management system looks daunting but it really is very  easy, as you can automate staff management. Every now and then, you just have to pluck some troublemakers. 

You get end credits during the first chapter of the story and you can stop from there if you want to. But if you want to know the stories of characters and the fall out of it all, then you can continue with chapter 2. 

As for the story, well frank it's quite convoluted but they stuck with it so I understand it may not be for everyone. 

Something I really appreciate is the chicken hat system. I have no need for the hardcore gaming experience and some missions are really very challenging for me. The chicken hat makes it bearable, and I can continue playing for the story.

As a big Ghost Recon fan I was left thinking this game was kinda silly, unrealistic and mediocre.  Well, happily I was wrong.  First of all the game allows you to turn off all those immersion-killing things like the enemy markers, hit indicators, action prompts, etc.  Then I managed to find a way to fix the other thing that was detracting in a big way from the experience - the ridiculous camera orientation.  Two issues with the camera: 1) it is way too close to Snake, and zooms in even further when crouched, reducing situational awareness massively, and 2) the slow-mo CQC camera just sucks - it is a weird mix of slow motion but also fast-motion animation that is disorienting and immersion breaking.  I found a mod that fixed both!  It's called ""Shigu's Camera Framework"" on Nexus Mods.  It's awesome, and now I can fully enjoy this experience!  Huge props to the mod author.  As for the game itself, it has far more depth and polish than I assumed, you don't have to use the stupid cardbox box, and contrary to my first impression the AI is actually very good, reacting reasonably to situations and presenting a genuine challenge.

The gameplay is smooth and the controls are easy to learn, making it accessible to players of all skill levels. The game's world is also beautifully realized, with a wide variety of different environments to explore and a dynamic weather system that adds a lot to the atmosphere of the game.

One of the things I love most about Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the sense of freedom and choice it gives players. You have a wide variety of different abilities and tools at your disposal, and you can approach each mission in a variety of different ways. The game also has a wide variety of different enemies to fight, each with their own unique abilities and behaviors, which keeps things interesting.

The graphics of the game are also a standout feature. The environments are all beautifully detailed, and the character designs are all very unique and interesting. The music and sound effects also add a lot to the atmosphere of the game.

Overall, I highly recommend Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain to anyone who enjoys stealth-action games. It's a fantastic game that offers a lot of depth and replay value.

For some reason ""MGSV Online"" multiplayer wasn't enough for Konami, they had to make MGSV singleplayer online too and the interactions between the singleplayer's online content and singleplayer gameplay is best described as ""invasive"", ""annoying"", and ""cash cow"".

I might've just griped about the crap storyline while praising the innovative gameplay before giving the singleplayer portion a thumbs up recommendation, but they had to graft on online gameplay that amounts to ""pay us real money to win at this"" while also destroying your attempts to replay they game as if it were the first launch again.

I want that start-from-scratch playthrough again so many years after I first bought this game but Konami won't let me have it. There is no true ""new game"" option for this game, the only option is ""pay us more"".",1456115405,1671939748,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

6/10 Only get if you can stomach Kojima's terrible way of story writing.

PROS

Game play i like for instance the combat and options for stealth is diverse fun and is what I primarily got the game for. 

CONS

*HOWEVER*, the abundance of enemy weaponry and their autistic AI just wants me to sometimes breeze through the game due to.....The Story, and how its delivered by our boy Kojima. 

This guy no doubt brought us the banger that was MGS 1, 2 and especially 3 back in the day (also partially responsible for MGRR) and many others but this, this game is the perfect example when you give somebody too much creative freedom and starts to sniff their own farts. The cutscenes ARE TOO LONG to the point I dread even wanting to load the game or even progress. The acting is that strange MGS4 effect that I can only describe as uncanny. I swear all his stuff goes on for too long to the point everything feels 'off' and strange and not in a good way. It makes everything boring. You can tell Kojima is the kind of guy that whatever comes to his mind he instantly adds to the canvas resulting in a cluttered abomination. It also doesn't help when he nuts his name all over the screen every chance he gets for making this 'thing' that doesn't even makes sense in the metal gear cannon.

I applaud the devs for trying something new (for Metal Gear) : an open-world in which the player accomplishes missions to progress the story... Except, it doesn't.

This mission system really hurts the narrative, a feature so crucial to a Metal Gear ! Only a few of these actually move the story forward; most of them are just tied together by a loose thread and the only payoff is resources.

Speaking of rewards, the game is a GRIND. You have to work to get anything. You have to upgrade your base, to unlock weapon, you have to go out with buddies to gain new commands, you have to steal everything, people included. All of which would be fine if properly tuned, but this game insist on being a live service.
Right now, I'm researching a weapon. It will be available in A FEW DAYS. This is insanity.

I was so uninvested in the game that, by the end of Chapter 1, when the game felt it was over, I couldn't bring myself to see what Chapter 2 would bring to the table.

Edit : Chapter 2 brought nothing to the table. The game pretty much ends with chap 1.
I knew Konami axed the third one, but from what I've seen, it was the only one to suffer.
You get remixes of old missions and almost nothing else. So you play what is there and sometimes something interesting pops up. And eventually you get an ending.

Such a wasted potential. I had some fun though.",1465430941,1671477704,False,1,0,0.492487639188766479,0,True,False,False

One of the best Tactical Espionage game there is, this game is the 5th installment in the Metal Gear franchise by Hideo Kojima that has multiple interesting game mechanics where players are able to choose how they want to play through the missions at hand. It also comes with a deep storyline and character growth that gives high replayability. Now, with the new buddy system, you can undertake missions with some backup. You can also test your skills by playing the game in online mode against other players.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Feels similar to ""MGS 3: Snake Eater"" but instead, players are in an Open World map and pretty much can do anything, either go full on stealth or guns blazing. As usual, some missions require stealth completely whilst there are also side missions for us to complete. A new feature includes collecting resources for your base, in which includes vehicles, weapons, soldiers and buddies (team mates that help you on the field). There are also a lot of mods available to improve graphics and overall quality of life.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics is extremely good and light, no issues on low-end or mid-end machines. Extremely detailed compared to most games.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The music and themes are very good like almost all games from the MGS franchise. The voice acting is also very good and you may barely notice the difference compared to the original voice actor, David Hayter to Kiefer Sutherland.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Controls are relatively easy and fine tuned both for Controller and on Keyboard+Mouse

[h1]Bugs & Issues[/h1]
1. Slight issue where you cannot control the camera sensitivity too much
2. On online plays, you will find glaringly obvious cheaters, like having Invulnerability and Teleportation when in PvP, the clips are even available in Youtube
3. Some features from MGS 3: Snake Eater was removed, which was the ""Camo Index"" where the pattern of your camo equipped is based on the terrain (more realism). Now, it does not matter what pattern you use, the camo index is the same
4. Minor features like climbing trees or lush and interactive surroundings like tall grasses are not available like in MGS 3: Snake Eater, which is a shame

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall a great game with extremely high replayability, a lot of fun when playing to release stress, since you can do so much that other Open World games could not offer. Playing missions to goof of like crazy makes this game too good to pass off. Too bad that Konami screwed Kojima Productions, and now we will never get any new good MGS games.",1479053672,1671363600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have always loved this franchise ever since I first played Sons of Liberty on the PlayStation 2 at age 7). Metal gear is a series that is primarily story first or at least very dialogue heavy. This game however isn't so much orientated around that unless you count the few cut-scenes and bulk of cassette tapes. The story also isn't the greatest in my personal opinion (that'd go to 2). However, the game-play is fast, sleek, and encourages the player to play as they wish. I truly enjoyed my time with this game and had to 100% it for the 3rd time except instead of two dead consoles it's now on a new PC I acquired 5 months ago. one small gripe that irks me quite considerably is the freezing and crashing but I assume that can be tweaked out somehow.

I'm gonna brief since some of you may be confused to why I gave this game only a 7 based on how much I liked the gameplay, the story, the music, etc.. 
 
First of all, this game I think was great. It has a very deep and mature story, and playing or watching all the other Metal Gear games before that is I would say a must. The gameplay is super fun and it never gets boring. The base bulding is very well made and satisfying. Characters are very good. Voice acting is very good. I have a lot of praise for this game, even though it does get repetitive at times.

Now for the bad: The game is not finished. I'm not sure of the details but Konami fired Kojima, the lead director of the game, before the game was completed which in turn affected the game story deeply as it feels incomplete. The game does have an ending and it's pretty good in my opinion. However, there are so many plot holes and unanswered questions that it's completely obvious how great this game could've been if Kojima was allowed to achieve his vision and complete the story. 

Ultimately, based on everything that I said above, that is why I believe this game is a 7/10 but IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE! I still recommend it!

Their roots are varied. Diverse. America's never been made up of just one people. But he tried to forge a single consciousness. For it, and from it. The idea that every citizen would use free will to unite behind their country... Unilateralism like that can't be entrusted to any one individual. So the major sought a system which used information, words, to control the 'subconscious'.

""To unite America and the entire world. The major thought this was his friend's will. But I think he never understood what she wanted. Before he ever walked, or cried - even before he was born - his mother tongue was English. He doesn't know the pain of losing his own language. Not yet. He cannot understand her will. I do. I was born in a small village. I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers. Foreign soldiers. Torn from my elders, I was made to speak their language. With each new post, my masters changed, along with the words they made me speak. Words are... peculiar. With each change, I changed too. My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong... War changed me - and not only my visage. Words can kill. I was invaded by words, burrowing and breeding inside me. A philosopher once said, 'It is no nation we inhabit, but a language.' 'Make no mistake, our native tongue is our true fatherland.' My fatherland - my truth was stolen from me. And so was my past. All that's left is the future. And mine is revenge. On those who'd leech off the words of their fellow man. This is what I learned from the major. And then it hit me. It was he who should feel my wrath. He and the code he chose as basis for control. Language codes, information codes - beamed all around us - genetic codes spanning history. By controlling the codes, Cipher... Zero intends to unify the world. Codes implanted into our heads, sucking our minds dry as it spreads from one host to the next. A parasite upon the earth. That is what Zero is. As one born into this world, he's afflicted. I hold him responsible for killing my freedom. Killing all traces of my past... Killing any promise of a future... We are all but dead men forced to walk upon this earth. A world reduced to Zero. Cipher plans to use its codes to control the world. They think they can.

""And the 'mother tongue' of all those codes is English.

""The word became flesh. The final parasite.

""It knows English. An English strain of the vocal cord parasite.

""I will exterminate the English language. With this, I'll rid the world of infestation. All men will breathe free again - reclaim their past, present, and future. This is no ethnic cleanser. It is a 'liberator,' to free the world from Zero. Let the world be. Sans lingua franca, the world will be torn asunder. And then, it shall be free. People will suffer, of course - a phantom pain. The world will need a new common tongue. A language of nukes. My Metal Gears shall be the thread by which all countries are bound together, in equality. No words will be needed. Every man will be forced to recognize his neighbor. People will swallow their pain. They will link lost hands. And the world will become one.

""This war is peace.""

Pride, feeds their blackened hearts

And the thirst, must be quenched, to fuel hypocrisy

Cleansing flames, is the only way to repent

Renounce, what made you

Words that kill, would you speak them to me

With your breath so still, it makes me believe

The Sins never die, can't wash this blood off our hands

Let the world fear us all, it's just means to an end

Our salvation lies, in the Father’s sins

Beyond the truth, let me suffer now

In my heart I just know that there's no way to light up the dark in his eyes

Whoahoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo whoaHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO whoaHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooOOooOOooOOooOOOOOOOOOOOOOO whoHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO whoaHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


""When the world witnesses Sahelanthropus, the hands of the doomsday clock will roll on, regardless of Zero.

Also, currently I'm limited to a fairly potato-ish gaming laptop (Lenovo. Still good but I wanna say it's over a decade old). And while I did have to turn down the settings, the game still runs impressively well maintaining 60fps with very few frame dips.

Admittedly, the story is not as dense as other Metal Gear titles, but I would argue that's a pro for the average player jumping into the franchise. Metal Gear can be quite intimidating. Ground Zeroes was my first and I'm not convinced I'd be as big of a fan if I had started with 1-4. All this to say, V's story is a little overhated imo. It's a simple revenge plot with enough Kojima weirdness to decide whether or not his games are for you. And while cheesy at times, it does its job well enough to keep you engaged. I actually really enjoy its darker elements. Especially when it teeters into horror territory.

That said, without giving any spoilers, the ending of this game is more profound if you've experienced the rest of the series. At least the Big Boss era games MGS3 & Peacewalker. (Portable Ops too if you want). If you're a newcomer it's fine, it still makes enough sense. Just be aware.

Warts and all, I LOVE this game. Potentially in my top V (pun intended). I know it's dorky to say, but it really makes you feel like the legendary Big Boss! Highly recommend.",1670905716,1670913199,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

my all time favorite is Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater among the series
but Phantom Pain is the second most favorite one and so on.

This Game is incredibly amazing, i mean the story the action and the game mechanics is great.

This Game pursue the ""Stealth Trademark"" Of a franchise, but it is the first Open World game Among all Sequels.

Its Giving you very Fantistic experience that you never had.

I Would Recommend this Game All those gamers who play Offline or Online games, start to play i know it is already too late beacase this game released almost 7 years ago
but you""ll going to exerience thrilling stealth action and amazing things in this game which you can not feel most newly released games.

The most good thing about this game is you can play as Single Player (The Main Game) you can play offline and online, and as Multiplayer (Metal Gear Online III) 
i would recommend this game specialy for new gamers those who play only Online or Multiplayer games so i have to say
try this game and it will change your thoughts about offline story mod games.

Metal Gear Solid is no doubt about that it is Best of Its Kind.

Getting this on PC for $4.99 was an easy choice, where I can put everything to ULTRA settings and pretty much play a remastered version from the consoles at 60FPS instead of 30. 

It's a shame we'll prob never get a MGS 6 on PS5 or PC (F you Konami). But what we get is this masterpiece that should never be forgotten. Even the online is a lot of fun as you can invade other people's bases and steal their supplies to help you in the campaign. ONE negative is the story was never completed, and Konami rushed Hideo Kojima to finish it.  

The story does not end like the other Metal Gear games, and even has hidden endings you have to grind to achieve. EVERYTHING else is perfection, especially the amazing freedom in the gameplay and the AI that is still top tier for games today. I still wish they had David Hayter the original voice actor for Snake, but Mr.Sutherland does a fine job in his place.

-great, simple character control
-diverse and unscripted combat
-great graphics
-moddable
-2 optional multiplayer modes

Cons
-super generic and bland compared to prequels, can't tell its japanese, 
-little to do with the rest of MGS
-story is unique but kind of boring and very incomplete
-empty world with small, isolated, interactive locations
-inflated power economy. You seem to always have a too much money and support, can have items or bombs dropped anywhere at almost any time, and have very little reason to upgrade anything which is kind of the series' selling point.

I got into the series to prepare for MGSV but loved the old ones a helluva lot more after getting over their frustrating quirks. The mechanics are kind of like Far Cry or Zelda: BOTW but not as good.

- Multiplayer is not as optional as pre-release trailers suggested. Kinda neat to see the Diamond Dogs' base expand over time though. 
- The open world gameplay does come with many interesting new ideas for a Metal Gear.

Everything about this game confirms that Kojima is the most pretentious/overrated game designer out there. 

Few other things:
-Maybe the only game I've ever seen to not have some basic volume control built into the game
-Timer based base mechanics that are just completely unfun. On top of that they are based on in-game time.

most of my time is idle and forgetting to close the game.

PROS:
The game rocks
truly

The story is short but doesnt get lost in the semi open world STAGE missions
Stage missions for those that dont know are when you get S-F Ranking after MISSIONS only not side ops.
so dont go for S right away. Open more gear first,
dont go for all the secrets right away, most you CANT anyway due to needing to unlock more gear or team squads first

The game is NOT truly open world. 
There are 2 maps, with about a dozen sub maps NOT counting  lookout posts *3 -5 guard things
So while yes you are free to roam, you will be blocked by INVISIBLE WALL BARRIERS
see Cons
and no real reward for exploring anything until far later in the game.

With 73 hrs played dont do as I did and just run around Mother Base for diamonds. 
you have time later !

Cons:
seriously there are  tons but the game out shines

AI is idiotic, no I dont mean when you are prone or hiding 
The AI only gets worse as you get better gear and better at the game,
You can kill someone and lie right ON TOP of that dead body and no one will see you even with thermal goggles UNLESS they walk on you
So its easy to just drag a body out or toss a clip and the morons of course send 1 guard only

Alert the AI all scamper to on place which seems lame, its not even fortified. Why if I didnt feel the need for stealth, id use their own mortar and kill em.

All in all the AI is not great, there is worse but its a huge shortcoming esp since online is gone 

*MGO
Doesnt exist, consoles removed it, soon a HUGE chunk of all campaign missions will be taken away
forward bases will not be accessible nor will any gun or placement you capture * you can never use these only vehicles for your attack squad missions.
SO RIP to GMP= cash and researched mats while on and offline will reduce in half, trust me this hurts cash flow.

As stated above this game isnt actually open world
sure you can get on a horse and ride around kill everyone get all materials
in the end  you just wasted your time.
As I did, instead just wait for real missions until you can capture cargo containers 
dont even BOTHER with the tiny stuff 

this started irking me as I went all over taking over base after base and outpost
all to find it was for nothing.
CON CON *
The game is buggy so just try this
go into any base with power on off
turn the power OFF just before you leave that base on heli

come back later
all the lights wont work, and you can keep killing or ko guards as they come 1 by 1 to turn the power back on

so lame that you can go so many days in game and they never fixed the power button?

DOG
well he was a puppy then 20 hrs into the game, just 20 HRS 
he is a full grown wolf.
WAH?
what is in those cigars?

Cigar
The cigar can be useful for speeding up research
also getting ammo
BUT i find it terrible
to understand why, go to mother base, and upgrade the base 
doesnt matter where or which
med, rnd.. anything
now   smoke the cigar
did the base finish?
NOPE
you MUST leave the base, then fly OUT of base area *to land
then fly BACK to base to get the damn thing to complete
terrible

NO JUMP
well there is, kind of, and as a coder I can tell you not many full open world games let you just jump
there are reasons for this. Mostly falling through or getting stuck in the map.
Sadly this is where you go, this is open world but I cant jump up on this tiny log?
SIGH no jumping at all = easier to code and less bugs but total confusion in any real world application.

GET THIS GAAAAME
I got it and all DLC in a bundle that was less than 3$ for this!
Id say pay what you want its totally worth more than 3$ or 10$  
Get it  
Play it
Beat it 
Then have fun inside with the toys you didnt use due to wanting full stealth muahha

IF ONLY they added air vehicles you controlled. Just cause ? giggle

game 8/10  decent port but shows xbox buttons + keyboard bindings  confusion abound.
Music 9/10  just.. go into quiets cell and sit, if you are my age COUGH 45 you will know most of the songs :P
Sounds 2/10  Boss you get told the same darn thing over and over again it hurts, ""you gunna take him too?""
EVERYONE!!
controls 3/10 - 7/10  
Start off with ZERO understanding of how to play. Get the manual out for PC KB mouse or even controller
many things arent told to you but are in the manual
MINUS  press L analog stick + E   *see my screen shot 
I use space as run mostly, ME1 ME2  
Space in this game = dive into a prone 
sooo you get used to the controls and it goes from 3/10  to 7/10


I will modify this more but I want to say the game is great until you realize its the same 90 areas over and over
with a few specks of glitter.

Its a great game for the series and I can only see more RPG and open world added
provided they get jumping down*thats hard to do open world btw  I know, ive coded these
Just imagine a scale of Morrowind or for kids, Skyrim sized maps 
with skill trees instead of just rnd

[b]Pros :[/b]
+ Several complex and unique gameplay mechanic in an open world + stealth genre

+ Base building plus you can recruit your own soldiers/army à la Pokémon. In Pokémon you use Poké Ball, in this game you use Fulton extraction.

+ Huge amount of replay value or replayability.

+ You can choose variety of ways to complete a mission from total stealth to total chaos like rambo or something like that.

[b]Cons :[/b]
- The story is unfinished.

- Some grind-fest are fun. But there are couples of grind-fest are feel like a chore, like grinding resources for research/build/development items and your base.

- I really dislike 1 thing from this game that is ""waiting time"" to develop/build something in this game. Almost 30% of my playtime was AFK just to wait ""offline"" item research/development finished. Ranging from 18 minutes to several hours to complete each item and it's using in real life time and only counted while you are in game.

""Online"" items are far more ridiculous, ranging from several hours to several days or week. At least online items counted ""online"" and you don't need to open your game at all to wait that.

- There is microtransaction for the online portion of the game

[b]Overall, Recommend this game when it's on sale.[/b]

[h1]Reasons to play:[/h1]
1. Photo-realistic but stylized Graphics.
2. Can run on Potatoes. (I know because I did.)
3. Still holds up 7 years after release.
4. Unlike MGRR, this game was made with PC in mind meaning you'll never be at a disadvantage by not having a Bluetooth or Wired Controller.
5. Literally 1984. (not joking)
6. You can find many popular songs from the Era such as; Take on Me, Fortunate Sons, and even the Main Menu theme for Metal Gear Peacewalker in the form of tapedecks/boomboxes.
7. You can smoke and it speeds up time.
8. There's a set of Side-Ops that allow you to sit in a box and then you're target will walk up to you and salute you.
9. You woke up from a coma.
10. [spoiler]You get to make nukes.[/spoiler] 
11. Misunderstood Anti-war Masterpiece.
12. You can make a water-gun.
13. There's a Sniper that has... uh... a lot of fan service and... umm... jiggle-physics...
14. You can kill you're staff, not telling you where though.
15. It's an open-world game with two separate areas to explore and many Guard Posts you can capture.
16. 50 missions... [spoiler]wait isn't there one more? No? There's no 51st mission? Man, I thought there was gonna be a Lord of the Flies referencing mission.[/spoiler]
17. You will be Face to Face with the Man Who Sold The World.
[h1]Reasons not to play:[/h1]
1. [spoiler]It's missing it's third chapter unless all Nuke owners dismantle theirs or others steal them and dismantle those.[/spoiler]
2. [spoiler]Missing the 51st mission.[/spoiler]
3. Incomplete in general.
4. Overuse of certain areas.
5. Certain missions are recycled and given new parameters such as not being able to go into the mission with any equipment, having stronger enemies and no reflex mode, or total stealth, (My least favorite.) meaning that if you're detected, the mission is a failure and you must return to the last checkpoint.

I 100% completed the game before reviewing. Took around 120h.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
It's good. It's really f. good. There are few games which I feel so strongly about recommending, even fewer that I feel hold up for near entirety of the 100% completion process.

If what you've learned about this game over the years peaks your interest in any way - get it. I will say that without first 100% completing MGS Ground Zeroes you may have a hard time understanding the story, but that's the only caveat here (and Ground Zeroes is a good game in it's own right now, when it costs a normal price).

[h1]Description[/h1]
MGS5 is a stealth-action game where you play a commando/soldier/special-operative and complete different missions while managing your entire support backend including mission support, companions, transportation and even research and development of new weapons and tech.

Game is set in a sci-fi version of 1984. There are superpowers and tech not available at that time. MG series is not trying to be authentic/realistic like Splinter Cell for example.

The story continues from Ground Zeroes and I will not spoil it here. Suffice to say that you play a guy who gets involved with a multi-national conspiracy that threatens the stability of entire world. You will probably not get much invested within the story unless you are deep into MGS series already, at which point you are not reading this dumb review to make sure you want to buy the game, because you've already completed it, have you?

There are 2 large, open-world style maps with many enemy bases on them, and most missions will take place on some preset area of those maps. You can still explore and attack bases without an active mission if you want.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Engaging gameplay[/b]
This is a stealth game where if you get noticed - alarm goes off, but most missions don't immediately fail. You can still bruteforce your way through most objectives, shooting enemies and blowing sht up.

Stealth is pretty basic at first, but gets deeper with equipment unlocks. You start with a pistol with sleeping darts that can put enemies out of commision for a while. You can also sneak behind and grab enemies for a kill or a knockout. You may even interrogate captives to gain info about mission objectives or enemy forces.

Later you can unlock things from sleep grenades to long range, silenced sniper-rifles as well as support actions like artillery strikes and equipment like echolocation device or night-vision goggles.

[b]+ Deep and wide systems[/b]
You have a base of operations and while you are on a mission - you can capture and kidnap enemy soldiers for your own army. You can then send them on missions and put them in different jobs at the base, from intelligence and base development to research and development or off-map support teams.

Most improvements require money and resources. You earn money mostly by completing missions, which you can repeat. Resources are procured during missions or in online events/invasions. You can ignore invasions if you don't like the mechanic, but there are NPC bases to invade during events for some easy resources (once you learn to play well).

You can research different items and most of them lead to more research. For example after completing a research of a new grenade launcher, you may unlock ability to research a new version of it that fires smoke, stun or sleeping-gas grenades. The list of different upgrades is amazing and it's easy to find loudouts that you like to play with.

You also have several ""buddies"" - companions that you can take with you on missions. They also have research associated with them and their equipment, and are a great help on most missions.

Really there's just so much stuff to do here, that it's impressive how well all of those things work together to create an easily understandable and engaging gameplay loop.

[b]+ Attention to detail[/b]
There are many neat things in this game. For example - after every mission you must evacuate the area, usually by chopper. But you can also kidnap enemy resource container and stand on it while it's being picked up by your forces - that way will also extract you from the mission.

[b]+ Holds up for a long time[/b]
It does not get boring, that's it's greatest strength. Sure - there are some better and some worse missions, especially some side objectives and side-ops may get annoying or repetitive, but even then - game itself is still fun, just some situations are less so. I don't remember loving 100% completion for that amount of time (over 100h!).

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Sometimes iffy controls[/b]
Sometimes you will automatically get up from prone at inappropriate times when you want to remain hidden. Sometimes moving while prone you get stuck on every little piece of clutter or have a hard time to reorient yourself.

[b]- Some side objective descriptions/scripts failing[/b]
Descriptions are unclear or lie to you. Use guides for completionist runs, but even then - many guides are wrong about different things. There will be some frustrasion while completing the game.

[b]- UI[/b]
Too many problems to list. Starting from bad keyboard/mouse support, to some stupid quirks like unresponsive scroll-zooming. Game still plays better with KB+M than the controller (easier aiming), but it's annoying nontheless.

[b]- Assorted, minor annoyances[/b]
Like side-ops spawning when you don't want them, or boring animal completion.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
This is possibly one of the best games in recent memory. It has it's issues, but not enough to cut into your general enjoyment of the game. It sets a bar for stealth-action open-world games wich will not be passed soon.

I'd give MGS5 a well deserved

The positives

+Maybe the best gameplay of any game ever, with excellent variety and freedom of gameplay
+Extremely replayable
+Great soundtrack
+Good acting and characters
+Story is good, but unfinished
+Fantastic customization
+Although the game is unfinished, it's still pretty lengthy
+Good animations
+Good graphics, especially for a 2015 game
+Runs well and there are very few bugs

The negatives

-It's unfinished
-Quite a bit of the side content is pretty mindless
-The main character speaks way too seldom
-The open world(s) are pretty bad as well as ugly
-A lot of the story and lore is pretty hard to understand, even if you know the story of the previous games
-Too much waiting for upgrades
-Microtransactions
-Bad and boring multiplayer

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

People will likely get uptight about this as generally you go with the herd or you are hated. But I found this convoluted and boring, it felt like forever before I could even play the game due to a long drawn out intro and I felt bored pretty fast once I could actually play it.

It doesn't help that it is stuck at 60fps and feels very much like a console port and while you can edit the config to unlock fps, the performance is still terrible (under 100fps on a 4090 in a 7 year old game!) and it feels clunky as hell. Oh and when I reloaded into the game a few days later it reset the config so it was back to a painful 60fps again. 

It also annoys me that by default it insists on connecting to their server despite me playing single player, though you can disconnect in the options it should not be default for a single player game. 

I think I am just going to avoid Hideo Kojima games in the future as they really do not seem to be for me.",1668339772,1668339968,False,1,0,0.405133903026580811,0,True,False,False

B+: 
Storyline is gripping and brings you in immediately. Top tier cinematography sets the perfect mood, and the voice acting, camera work, and perfect musical score blend in harmoniously to release a masterpiece experience. Likely the most amazing camerawork and cinematics that I have seen in any game. The game is raw, dark, and intense. 

After the initial masterpiece, it turns into an open world game. Here, some of the clunky gameplay becomes an issue, but other interesting elements are added, as you work towards upgrading your base, etc. This concept of a ""home"" is something I like, and I am sure many others do as well. It gives a sense of ownership over the game and its progression. Cutscenes become less common, and main missions and side missions take over the main game.
30 hours in, and I am still enjoying it. Lots to upgrade and level up, and the progression allows stealth or heavy handed approached.
At around 40 hours, I begin to lose interest, and find it more difficult to continue with this game, likely due to a lack of cutscenes and story that made the first couple of hours exciting. Lots of grinding and clunky movements become apparent. Progression is moving slowly, and I am forcing myself to continue along, hoping that something sparks my attention again. 

Lots of playtime here. It kept my attention for the most part, but if you dont like it in the first 8 hours, give it up. Hours 20-40 will be more of the same. That being said, still a quality game here.",1650722434,1668294094,True,0,0,0.476973682641983032,0,True,False,False

Big fan of Metal gear and Metal gear Substance. MGS5 sucks.
mgs5 Intro is sooooo amazing, engaging, intense and then there is nothing for the rest of the game :( It has wonderful mechanic and graphic but theres just NO GAME. its just empty fields with few bots that are fun to kill at beginning but gets old after 10 min of gameplay.( think of Farcry 4 or 2). Theres no story no point no nothing. Its just carcass of game that had to be very good but was released unfinished 2 TIMES FOR A PRICE OF AAA SEPARATE GAMES. 
First they released demo Ground Zeros and sold it full AAA price as full game.
Then they released unfinished carcass Phantom Pain and sold it as full game AGAIN..
Its disgrace.",1668100952,1668101639,False,1,0,0.462868750095367432,0,True,False,False
