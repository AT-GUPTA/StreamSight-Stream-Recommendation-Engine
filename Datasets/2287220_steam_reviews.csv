Maybe you can have some fun with it but look at the achievements, less than 15% of people have won a drivers/constructors championship and it's easy enough to do with any team in under 3 seasons which tells you people get bored with it. There's so much unnecessary clicking in the menus which could easily be streamlined which just become a frustration over time.
Sure the graphics do look better but after time you rarely use those nice graphics and generally sit in the track overview screen anyway.
I ran into one bug with alarming regularity during my play time, getting locked in the menus during a race so you can't click anything and even if the race finishes you still can't select anything. You should expect this bug 1 in every 4 to 6 races which is very frustrating.

Id like to be able to start a driver development programme or manage some young drivers, The graphics are good and because its officially licenced you get all of the proper liveries, sponsors and tracks but i just feel as if the game has very limited lifespan.",1705507293,1705507293,False,3,0,0.522349953651428223,0,True,False,False

Now I will tell you what has been improved:
1. The behavior of drivers on the track became more similar to real racing
2. Voting on the regulations now have a stronger influence on the development of bolides and by the 3rd season everyone is already going pretty tight.
3. DRS has finally stopped being super effective, but still gives the opportunity to cars that are half a second slower to overtake and dozens of laps to keep in the air bag.
And now what's come out is a load of crap:
1. Added training team mechanics. They do not affect anything at all, except that if you do not train at all, at least there will be no errors. And still it is not a fact.
2. Contract management as was bullshit and remained still. You hire a pilot with a salary of 3.5kk, and he responds to you ""negative"". It turns out he wants 13.5kk. Take a wild guess. And so it is with all the specialists.
3. Uncomfortable ERS control. Either it's on full, or don't spend more than the return.

Yes they did improve a few aspects but it feels more like a chore now than ever. And I think regardless of what people say here that a majority of people feel the same way. With F1 Manager 22 I saw many long drawn out career mode youtube videos. Long after the game was released. With 23 it seems the buzz dried out very quickly. This game feels more like an expansion or a large update rather than an upgrade to the base game.
Now i cant put my finger on a single aspect that seems to grind me the wrong way, it just seems that in the search for more realism the game has forgotten....its a game. Its supposed to be fun. With 22 I went thru many seasons. With 23 I have yet to complete a single one. I get bored with it faster and the races feel more and more like a chore I loath getting into. And ill address the elephant in the room. I was hoping that 23 would finally have create a team, something that would make the chore at least  more personal and get me invested....but as we all know that was never added. And theres talk that it might not make it into F1 Manager 24. 
I recently went back and replayed Motorsports Manager. A game that F1 Manager highly copied. From the UI to the options to the way most things are done. Except that game still remembers its a game. Its meant to be fun. They added create a team after launch. They added different racing types other than F1. You can start in what essentially is F3 unlike F1 Manager. 
Maybe im just getting old and jaded but even the main F1 series suffers alot from the same issue. Its a great sim...but its just not fun. I would love to see the developers get away from the whole sim idea and maybe get into a more story driven experience. Sort of like the main F1 series did. Id like to make the game more personal. More interaction and choices to make. Custom teams...hell custom drivers. Maybe we could make our own driver and play as a driver and not the manager. Maybe you could allow your staff to actually do their jobs and run their departments based on their stats instead of micromanaging them to death.
Theres so much that could be done with this franchise that would make them the only ones doing anything like it....but I dont see these developers taking a chance and doing anything outside of small changes year over year. Thats why alot of people dont see even create a team coming any time soon. Something that could have and should have been patched in by now.
Overall id give this game a 6/10. Its better than an average sim but not by much and I cant recommend it to people new to the genre or game.",1703425901,1703425901,False,25,0,0.70690542459487915,0,True,False,False

While the visor cam offers a thrilling peek into the cockpit, the real racing action felt like a spectator sport.

Management, the core of this genre, is surprisingly shallow. Sure, you tinker with parts and fuel, but the impact feels minimal compared to the micromanagement thrills of other management games. Heck, I played $10 indie management sims in 2004 that offered more engaging gameplay loops than this.

F1 2023, with its actual racing and deeper control, ironically provides a more satisfying management experience. Here, you're not just pulling levers; you're feeling the car, the G-forces, the strategic heartbeat of every decision.

properly lazy developers, don't even understand the basics of what they're supposed to be simulating
race weekend formats are wrong for sprint weekends, its embarrassing.
tyre allocation is non existent.
my factory keeps catching fire, wind tunnel keeps having structural issues every year without fail even though its maxed out level 5
every year without fail piastri has a row with his engineer and loses loads of affinity and confidence
my car was fastest on stats by a mile but no matter what you cannot win the 1st 3 races for some reason in 2nd or 3rd season.
ai strategy is to just push for the first stint on max but if I do that my tyres melt so I end up going backwards, with a superior car...
pit crew development is awful, ruins the whole race aspect of the game as the crew get so tired so quick bless them.
No more development points for drivers or staff, the drivers stats are wrong, apparently piastri is no good but gasly is. 
work that out.
there are a plethora of other issues like team balancing, and car development rate that are inaccurate.

But here i will compare it to F1Manager 2022, i have at the time of writing this 57 Hours on F1M2022 it was just unplayable, this one i have managed to have more fun with it, they have fixed many issues but as of today (Nov. 28th) but had a long pause at update 1.9 so my assumption is they have their focus on next years game now,

there is still some leftover issues so if you prefer a smooth experience when playing this game, wait for the next one and hope is the best i can tell you. but the game is still playable, there is only 1 known UI bug that requires you to close the game, but besides that, the other issues have been fixed.


Now in comparison to Motorsport manager 4, for a mobile game, MM4 already has a platform on something to build on so their game is VERY smooth with no bugs, but it sacrifices the micromanaging and visuals for some very good Macro management and repeatability.

this game does the Micro Aspect of things much better, there is so many details to look at and it very much immerses you in the difficulty of the job, something MM4 does not have, it still lacks a little replayability, but it is an improvement over last years game.

in conclusion, this will get a thumbs up due to it being better then F1M2022

as a stand alone i would give it a 7.5/10 its a step in the right direction, hopefully this momentum continues.

and in comparison to the competition, it does very well what MM4 does bad, and MM4 does right what F1M2023 does wrong. in all honesty, you can get both and enjoy the pluses of both games. I would highly recommend to get it on discount, or wait for next years as signs show that this one wont receive updates.

-The are no Safety Cars.  After having played two seasons, I have yet to see a Safety Car.  There are VSCs and Red Flags, but never a Safety Car.  Completely unrealistic.
-There is no track evolution during qualifying.  In real life, drivers are jockeying to be the last car on the track during qualifying due to the significance of track evolution.  Here, you want to be one of the first cars out to avoid the interference from other drivers.  In real life, the drivers would be penalized for this kind of interference.
 -Lock ups happen all the time in real life and effect tire ware and tire temperature.  But lock ups are rarely catastrophic.  Here a lock ups will wreck your race as the driver sits there after a lock up and lets the field pass them before rejoining the race.

On average it's two crashes per hour, or 3-4 crashes per hour if I have Discord and FF in the background. Very unpolished product. Is this game made by amateurs or professional game developers? :(
Very annoying. Not worth the money ATM.
In addition there's plenty of unnecessary animations, that are slowing the game. I have to wait few seconds until the button ""NEXT"" shows up, because I have to watch some unnecessary animation. As if the button couldn't show up first, along with animation begin... :/   No respect for my time :/

Btw, deleting saves is very very user unfriendly. Why I can't mark and delete 30 saves at once?? Any1 can explaine it to me?
Seriously, amateur work.

FFS!!! And just another crash, just at the end of perfect training! :/
FFS! Half an hour wasted :/

Why doesn't my team remember that for EVERY TRAINING I want my car to be fueled for 20 laps?? 15 laps isn't enough to make a full check!! Are they morons?
Hey devs, seems like you managed to simulate a team of underdeveloped people... :/
 
EDIT 4:
This is obviously not a PC game. Graphically, it looks like a port from one of the older consoles, for example the Playstation 3. And stability issues tells me it's a crappy port :(
 
EDIT 5:
Btw, don't be Vista. Don't ask me so often to confirm my actions :/
If I make a mistake I'll load from a save, but don't bother me so often! :/
 
EDIT 6:
During the second practice session, MY drivers collided about 30 seconds into the session! Right after leaving the boks! WTF!???
The first driver was the better one, in a better car, with a better setup. They both had the same driving plan.
How the hell can the second driver hit the first in this situation?!
DEVS! You have to rule out impossible options! Geez :/
Cmon, wake the f up.
 
EDIT 7:
Ever heard of double clicking? Like e.g. when i double click on the save file, the save will be  loaded?

 The best thing on this game is that it gave me some motivation to become a game writer, because they are probably making this game being just game developers but having no idea or passion for motorsports what so ever....

But it has gotten better, adding things like a difficulty settings. And it is fun as an avid F1 fan I've had a great time. You can create your own story, like I took over Merc so practically replacing Toto so I let Hamilton go and brought Mick in. After the first two seasons of a 3rd fastest car slog finally we were the fastest but Mick couldn't keep it out of the wall and Russell just couldn't match Max's pace. Championship came down to the last race Max had had terrible form after crashing last couple races we needed a win, came down to the last three laps but Max sent it up the inside of Russell and didn't look back, I was crushed. Now season 4 begins.

There are definitely things I would love to see included like a much better stat data base. I'm an F1 fan after a few seasons I will want to see who came in P5 in the 1st Austrian GP, I will want to see how each season came out. For instants I think something like Football Manager has with it's crazy stat database. Other things I want to see are things from changing garage position to championship finishing order to being able to adapt my own teams engines (hopefully 2026 maybe).

I still cant recommend this game!
there is no genuine difference between this game and last game.. so save it for the next game. i will admit tho, unlike other brands, these guys, the devs, the design team, are actively working to improve the game as it goes.. so this only leads to a better game next year..hopefully.
I feel the hardest time of this game is the first year, possbily 2nd too depending on which team you start with.
AI are still unbalanced and inconsistent to reality!
game crashes alot still! altough, there is less spins, crashes and cautions during a race now! and its a little more realistic on this now too, soo kudos!
i wish this game could focus more on the celebratations, allow drivers to have their own helmet still when they move teams, bring records into the game, etc..... it would be alot better! game would feel more, incentive!

I cant recommend this game.....  here is why- 

- game crashes too much, if it doesnt crash, it freezes when you run out of fuel or towards the end of a session, at one point, i was getting a tip and it froze? HUH?
-Ai is badly unbalanced
-the driver behind you can follow you the whole race being 0.2 behind you but get no punishment, the moment you run out of ERS, the AI just bltiz you and while you recover, you lose spots and never re-gain
-car balance is bad. Redbull dominant all yet but ive had best strat and still lost to a Alpine and Aston Martin at Bahrain???
-Oscar P and Tsunoda are torpedos!  but you will get penalised for being hit still!
- penalites are too common 
- drivers ratings are very biased towards british drivers, how is Oscar a 73? how is Alonso also 2nd best??
- Too many accidents per race! spins and lock ups happen way to much and you loose way too much time for these! its ultra unrealistic!
- inconsistent driver/track and car balances during the race weekends- one race they get 15th, the next they get 2nd?? same type of track, how?
- F2 and F3 drivers are still not acknowledged, no photos or scans of face? ridiculous!

OK, so....sure, the updates, upgrades and all that are cool, but the game is seriously struggling to keep the glitches out.... not only that, it doesnt matter what car you start with, if your not paying attention 100% of the time, you will crash, cause an accident, lose several spots or in most practices or qualy, run out of fuel!
The AI is so unbalanced! one race in Australia, i have Alonso kicking my arse in a redbull, even putting 10 secs on Verstappen after just getting a full blown out upgrade on the underbody ( known to be the OP body upgrade to do in this game), but when i use Aston Martin in Australia, im like 10th and struggling!! 
The AI is not on easy, normal or hard mode! its, whatever the fuck we want it to be insane at! its actually crazy mode! A casual or first timer would not enjoy this game, the devs need to seriously balance the Drivers, the cars are no longer going to be the reason why you are up the front! oh and another thing, how the fuck is Oscar 73??? THE FUCK!! the kid showed potential and is doing insanely well even before the current run of form! he needs to be 83!! not 73!! ridiculous! and Ricco is 83?? THE FUCK?? his like 85-86! Lance stroll is also too high! Sainz and LeClerc are not their value and to have Alonso as 2nd overall?? seriously?? thats frigin laughable!! Devs need to overhaul this game real bad!
DO not buy yet! once the game balance gets done, then it will be a better and more fun game to play!

As of right now patch 1.5 i do not recommend to buy this.

There are too many bugs.

When they are fixed it is going to be a great game that is very very similar to f1 manager 22
The game is a bit more difficult, weird and has this cool new fastest pitstop mechanic that not realistic at all. You can literally gym train nearly full time and get the gap to 1.9 sec and all your pitstops are 1.9 if no mistakes happen. This is because car building is kinda useless.

The sprint races are unfortunately like last year. You qualify for the race in the sprint.

Other stuff i noticed were:
weather conditions change too fast in qualifying. wet to full dry in 1 min
Other team AI cars are broken at the start of the race (i play 32x speed williams)
When someone crashes its a 50/50 chance the victim gets the penalty

- grid penalties are very unclear, and not consistent with real F1 grid penalties, also never told what it is until race day, and don't even get to see the grid before the race start with penalties applied
- should start prior to current season -- so we can choose the drivers & staff if they are out of contract
- driver rating not being very reflective of real life - Piastri is too low, Stroll too high, Albon possibly too low, Perez too high, etc.
- No randomness in driver performance, at least so far -- Pourchaire is always top rookie, De Vries, Piastri and Logan always struggle

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
This game has improved on last years game in that the features that were rather shallow in F1 manager 22 have been more fleshed out in this years. It is also more of a challenge as you can't just put all the part development sliders to the right and churn out underfloors to quickly max out your cars potential and take the bottom team to the top within just a couple seasons. You have to actually think about your part designs and focus on particular aspect whilst aiming to have it ready for a certain race to get the most out of it. However, this game currently has 1 HUGE problem being the penalty system. I'm not sure how this wasn't found and fixed during QA but if 2 drivers collide the driver who caused the collision doesn't get the penalty, instead the other driver does. Which really ruins the game and forces a reload of the race start save if its your drivers because it's really not fair. I also noticed the drivers and staff contract renewals are now ridiculous where they expect a MASSIVE pay rise + bonuses compared to their current contract regardless of how well they have performed. Which really makes it more difficult then it needs to be for managing your teams finances. Overall, a few small features have been added that do improve the game and a few problems from last years game have also been improved on/fixed. But it doesn't feel like a new game, instead it feels like more of a big patch for last years game. I also don't know who asked for the scenario races? I have no interest in playing one off races based on the real world season. The community have asked for many other things from last years game that would have greatly improved this years. One of the big ones being the ability to switch teams within the same save if you are performing well to help prolong the replayability. Such as getting 1 team to the top then jumping to the current bottom team and try to do it again as well as being able to see how the other teams evolve. If you haven't played F1 Manager 22 then this one is worth the full price as you get to experience last years game + a few new small features and fixes from it. Otherwise, if you did play last years game I don't see the value for money in this years based on what little has been added/changed. When it goes on sale though I'd recommend it after they fix the penalty bug as that is game breaking. Besides that I am having fun with the game but it's the same fun I had with last years as too little has been added/changed to justify this at full price as a whole new game which is a real shame.",1691490933,1698180157,True,0,0,0.505183756351470947,0,True,False,False

As a lifelong Championship Manager into Football Manager fan I'm very familiar with the development cycle of new features and timeline it takes for a game to reach it's maturity so I'm willing to overlook the odd bit here and there.

Let's kick this off though with some positive feedback for Frontier...

1. Graphically, this is wonderful. The races, the camera views, the GUI in that part of the game is really well thought out and I thoroughly enjoy sitting back and watching the race in real time. I'd dreamt of something like this for FM (Football Manager) for years but it just doesn't work for them - it works here and it's your secret sauce.

2. It's somewhat consistent. Red Bull dominate and it's tough being another team chasing them and it's not been easy trying to build my team (Ferrari) up to them either - and it shouldn't be either. Kudos for making the challenge big enough.

So, some feedback.

- The render of the drivers in the menu is a long way off the graphics of the actual race. It should either be on par with it, or do not bother until it is.

- It's probably on the roap-map but extending this game out to extend to managing in F2 and F3 could be excellent. If you're a Team Principal climbing up the leagues it'll give more longevity to the experience.

- On that point - create a team. It's a must for the future and I realise it could be complicated because of how the car might look but with today's design abilities I see no reason why you can create a pool of ""fake"" sponsors branded like real companies to decorate your car with and a limited but functional design screen to get things like uniforms right. I really think this experience is worth investing ingenuity into because having the ""A rich benefactor has asked if you would like to be Team Principal for a new F1 team"" is a whole other dynamic to entering the sport.

- The research for next year system is a little primitive and confusing at this point and potentially needs a better graphical representation to show where the car needs to be in future seasons (with new regs) versus where your research currently is.

- The car adjustments and set ups could simultaneously be more complicated and sophisticated but also need simplification. To explain - I think the fine margins could be expanded upon in the way you set up for a car (how much to warm tires by, different fuelling strategies in race - heavy but push, lighter but conserve etc). For the hardcore, I feel this gives different increments to exploit but for the casual I'd suggest that more assistant based advice could help simplify car complexities on recommended set-ups. As a novice to this game but not this genre, I picked up enough quickly but it still feels largely like guess work. It's an area I think requires exploring.

Look, I've written a long review. The point is, I'm enjoying it. It's a bit primitive in it's form right now but I'm excited by it's potential and it's beautiful to watch a race. Thank you for the effort - please take on board what some fans think could help this grow - even if I'm wrong in my points, I'm sure F1 fans everywhere will help shape this into a truly AAA game - IF you listen to them.

Setups are a bit bothersome and unrealistic, apparently, changing everything in setups takes the same time as changing a bit on the front wing, It would be nice if there was cumulative time for changing multiple parts of the setup and that it was a bit clearer on how much the different options change each setup. 

Also, when starting practice, you should have somewhat of an idea of what setup you need to use, you are managing a professional Formula 1 team, but each race you start with about as much of an idea of the setup to use as the average person would have, none! It is like you are running a team of people who at the start of practice think that you could technically have the same setup for Monaco as for Monza.

You either have to choose to ignore track Acclimatization or choose to drive 20 laps per practice more than all the other teams which means you wear down your parts much more than all other teams. 
It would be nice if the race simulator actually give you some base acclimatization as the drivers would have practiced the track in advance, the higher level of race sim, the higher base acclimatization.

Look, I’ll tell this beforehand, I’ve been a hardcore F1-fan for more than 30 years. When there is no race I’m following F1-news, love all the on- and off track drama and everything related to the sport. So this review will maybe be a bit over critical but it comes from a good place. F1 manager is supposed to be giving you the feeling that you’re calling the shots be it on or off track. It succeeds in some, but fails in most. Here’s my comprehensive review. 

[h3]An F1-weekend on average[/h3]
The drivers arrive trackside on Wednesdays or Thursdays on average, where Thursday is press day (which the game doesn’t use to any extent btw). On Fridays (on a non-sprint weekend) the drivers have two 1-hour practice sessions, Saturday has a third 1 hour practice and Qualifying and on Sundays they drive the GP (+- 300 KM or 186,5 Miles). The practice sessions make or break a drivers weekend. Crashing or having mechanical issues will, more often than not, result in a below average qualifying and race result. F1 manager tries to simulate these conditions by tracking 3 parameters: Track-, setup-, and parts knowledge. These 3 parameters result in a weekend average of confidence which has an impact on their Quali and/or race results. Are you with me so far? Great.

Where F1-managers falls short is that there is no focus on the use of tires during the race weekend at all. F1 uses 3 different compounds of tires during a race weekend (soft, medium and hard tires) all with their own time delta an unique operating temperature. Knowing the graining and overall degradation of each of the compounds is an major aspect of having a successful Quali and race. F1 manager misses out by not forcing the player to do a mandatory amount of tire tests. F1 irl has a race and Quali simulation test somewhere during practice sessions, F1 manager has none which messes with feeling of being in charge of an F1-weekend. 

[h3]Quali and racing, hit or miss[/h3]
The qualifying sessions are as close a real race weekend in terms of on track action. I really love the addition of mandatory tire use on some race weekends (hard Q3, medium Q2, soft Q1). Missed chance is not implementing the new sprint-weekend setup which has regular qualifying on Friday and the Sprint-quali and race on Saturday. Instead it follows the old rules where a sprint-weekend has a sprint race on Saturday which determines the grid on Sunday (a format which sucked irl imo). 

Huge frustration during qualifying is drivers on in- and out laps blocking the drivers on a quali lap. Sure, it happens irl as well but you just know that when you come across a slow driving car in a certain turn that you can terminate your fast lap because you’re going to be held up. It’s better than in last year's game but it’s not good enough. Just make the threshold for drivers slowing down and giving space even bigger than it’s now (within 5 seconds for instance). And if the drivers do impede then give them a penalty, no penalties are given in qualifying, ever. 

The race is a big hit or miss also, tire management is just not good, like at all. Driving in dirty air has huge repercussions in a real F1-race, on your tires, on your engine (cooling). But driving within 1 second has a real biig advantage irl, DRS. But the DRS in F1-manager barely does anything, maybe you gain a tenth or 2. You know what happens when a Red Bull follows a McLaren on the Baku (over 1 KM) straight with DRS, it blasts past them, even when being over 0,7 seconds behind them. But there’s little real impactful tire and temperature management, blue flags and drivers getting out of the way is non-existing and when taking over a car that’s about to be lapped they become a menace by clinging on to your back because they now have DRS and all of a sudden have a car that’s able to keep up with you. 

[h3]Managing the team[/h3]
A compliment where a compliment is deserved of, the UI in the management portion of the game is great. Everything is easy to find, you get accustomed to each menu and sub-menu within a couple of hours. If you have played last years game the transition is almost one-on-one. Good stuff. The team management in itself is good but still to shallow for my taste. Give me more options to train the drivers, let me take them to the simulator and drive a race with them to improve certain aspects. Let me have conversations with the crew, let me see the pitcrew training, let me pinpoint on where to exactly improve. I want to feel immersed in F1, this gives me the feeling that I’m experiencing the surface of something that has much more depth.

[h3]Some final words[/h3]
If you made it this far, massive respect for your persistence. Like I said, I’ll probably spent an insane amount of hours with this game. Because I’ve just put Verstappen and Norris in the same team, Verstappen has Bono as his engineer and Norris has GP. I can take the best personnel from each team and make an all-star F1 team. Develop my car into an absolute beast only to be thrown back in the midfield at the start of the season (what is that about?). 

Is F1 manager 2023 good enough to have a casual experience of what F1 is like? Yes. Is F1 manager 2023 good enough for more hardcore fans looking for something that truly represents their beloved sport? No, not by a long shot. And given the lack of support of the ’22 game and the financial results of Frontier this last year it doesn’t bode well for F1 manager ’23 to get proper support, where bugs are fixed and more features are added.

Qualifying straight up doesn't work, if there is an out lap/in lap car in front of you you will get stuck behind them and lose time 100% of the time. It takes 4-5 attempts per qualifying to find the right time for a clean lap. Yes it happens in real world but very rarely with heavy grid penalties. Just make qualifying ghosts and let cars go through each other, it's easier

Why is there so little customisation? Why is ERS not just a slider and let us decide how much to deploy/save. Also we need to decide where to deploy, i would happily deploy all my battery to get out or DRS range not just use more battery over the whole lap

Engine and part wear seems to be about 2-3x more, I've gone through an engine after 3 races.... going faster or slower seems to have no effect on wear???? 

Mid race strategy menu doesn't let you change your pace prediction on the tyre you're currently on, safety car comes out, can I make it to the end on this tyre for track position if I slow down or should I pit? Can't tell

Do not pay full price for this game, lazy developers who clearly have never watched an F1 race and have never played the game

F1 Manager 23 urinates on the grave of a beloved dead franchise. This reanimated corpse has started to smell and fall apart. My recommendation is to not buy another entry in this series and to go play Motorsport Manager instead. I do not recommend this game to anybody.

There are major bugs that go unfixed, the game cannot get the F1 rules correct. The major example is the AI will use the same tire compound for each stint in their race, while F1 rules require that 2 different compounds are used with 1 compound being a mandatory compound (medium or hard) with an exception for when wet tires are needed. The developers kept promising to fix things in the game, but never addressed this glaring issue.

The latest hot fix introduced a regression where the cost-cap in the game will not display correct figures. You will still be held to the cost cap, but don't know what it is due to the display issue. That regression from the hot fix still has not been fixed. For me, this makes the game almost unplayable.

The races feel clunky and awkward this year. The simulation behind the scenes determine certain outcomes, such as two drivers racing wheel-to-wheel coming into contact. The display engine to render that outcome seems to have to force the outcome, which results in weird issues where drivers appear to try to kill their rivals by turning directly into them. There are various other issues reported all over the Steam forums and Subreddit with funny screenshots, such as cars coming to the pits and then exiting and racing with no tires.

The lack of care is evident in this game. I love F1, and I love the concept of this game. The execution is poor, and with issues not being remediated, I feel duped. I forgave these actions last year thinking it was the first game and the issues would be fixed in the second. I should have waited to see. Do not buy this game, do not buy next years' entry.

I AM having fun, don't get me wrong. But I am missing stuff. There's just not enough management going on. For that pricetag I would expect to have at least some features that would make my time in the game worthwhile. Sadly most of anything in it does not impact anything whatsoever. Between races I hire and fire people, design car parts, build car parts, upgrade facilities and try not to do anything stupid. And when it comes to trackday...I play a minigame with sliders and give some orders from time to time that don't seem to affect the outcome very much...if at all (trust me I tried and the results were pretty much the same, no matter if I did give orders or not). Now I realize I'm not having as much fun as I thought I had. Huh.

All in all it is a decent game. But there's stuff missing. Interaction and response to things feels worse than in F1 Manager 22 and let's be honest here...the ""new"" features Frontier put in here are not worth 50-60 bucks. Not even close. I understand that the license is expensive but as a developer, if you want to get your expenses back, you maybe should try to make a product that actually fullfills the expectations of your customers. On a technical level, Frontier nearly made no mistakes...gameplay wise...I'd probably stick to Motorsport Manager 2 or some other MOBILE game with more depth and impact.

2. Not enough lap time penalty when tyres overheat (AI tends to abuse this and run at full tilt constantly)
3. AI has endless fuel / tyre /ERS to keep pushing constantly
4. AI drivers still go for a second lap in Q1 when in P1-P3
5. AI drivers will go for second lap on Inters when the first lap in that session was on soft. So there is no way or chance of improving on either inters or wets

None of them was as basically tedious as F1 Manager 23 - whomever developed this have absolutely zero idea about how F1 shows and it shows SORELY (biggest glaring issue - there's no dedicated sprint race qualifying). 

The level of micro-management required is insane - e.g. on the opening lap, you have to constantly instruct your drivers to push, use ERS, use fuel or they'll drop positions like sacks of potatoes and form a little train of cars behind them; I mean, F1 drivers that NEED TO BE TOLD TO GO FAST...and I thought teams usually had the opposite problem :D

The new ""pitcrew management"" feature is useless drivel that adds nothing to the game - if not yet another micromanagement headache; All of the presets the game proposes make your pitcrew arrive exhausted at the race. You literally have to go and set each training session for each single day one by one to get them to perform half decently. I mean, what the heck is my sporting manager doing? Making espresso? 

On top of that, the UI is a confused mess - important things such as weather changes are not communicated in any details (e.g. a ""weather map"" feature would've been great) and things such as weather forecast over the race duration are buried in the race strategy menu; Most micromanagement operations are a nightmare of clicks and ""are you sure?"" menus.

Now, the AI were useless in 22, especially during changeable weather condition they'll go full Williams in Donington '93 and do repeated pitstops as soon as the weather changes; In 2023 they've all hired a  - sometimes they stop as soon as the first drops of rain come and they NEVER get it wrong; Also, all cars/teams seem to generally be running similar if not the same strategy. 

FInally, purely from a gameplay standpoint, the game is an insane sink of time; Each race week end takes absurdly long to manage and a season is 23(!) races long. Now, there isn't an immediately easy solution to this if you wanna keep a level of ""realistic rendition of an F1 Grand Prix"", but things such as giving the option to simulate free practice while also GIVING A GENERAL DIRECTION to the team - e.g. ""Simulate session - focus on setup"" or ""race pace"" etc. would've been a great addition, rather than the generic ""simulate"". Also, give the player the opportunity to create custom season with less races - those of us ""old timers"" with jobs etc. would love to kick Las Vegas, Baku, Abu Dhabi, Singapore etc. off the calendar to have a sane number of races :D

It looks as though it only happens on the first race of the season, but game crashes follow to spoil the fun further.  I have kept going and just accept the shortcomings.... just because it is genuine F1 and great to play in that world... but the developers must surely give greater consideration to customers when releasing full price games with flaws like these.

You likely will enjoy a decent portion of your time with this game. This games presentation is top-notch and the radio calls for engineers and drivers as well as commentators provides a fantastic atmosphere. 

But the more time you spend with it the more you see some of the shallow aspects of the simulation taking away from your enjoyment. Tire management makes little to no difference, overtaking is often way too difficult. Obviously the developers took the feedback from last years game to heart but took it both too literally and too far. This years game has more perceived depth and is more difficult. But the difficulty doesn't particularly feel fair, especially for a backmarker team. For example pulling off a godly qualifying after nailing your setup and practice just leads to you immediately falling to the back of the pack and crashing as your driver loses confidence every time they're overtaken and telling them to defend like a lion just makes it way too likely you'll crash. Even around Monaco it feels better to be at the back trying to overtake then at the front defending (and overtaking is unreasonably difficult this game imo, likely due to the change to how ERS works). 

I found research did surprisingly little. Even putting most of a year's Wind Tunnel time and CFD Hours into next years car did next to nothing for my relative performance. On top of that for most of my ~40 hours playing this game development was broken with the sliders changing absolutely nothing on next years car. 

Overall, my message to Frontier is that the game has a great deal of potential but the key structural design problems that plagued last years game continue here. I have no idea what the fix is but I can say I think it'll need to be a creative change not just tweaking values and adding another mechanic here or there. I'll probably be skipping next years game and coming back in 2-3 years to see what they've achieved.",1694063874,1694063874,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You can't do a qualifying lap without being blocked by other cars, you can't make a career with a team in the second half of the standings because inevitably you're either blocked in qualifying and then you start last or the drivers lose their morale and don't I don't do anything the rest of the race, either Haas suddenly becomes a red bull on old hards and overtakes you on soft rubbers or new mediums. In essence, it's a game that feels extremely random, you don't feel the aspects like the car should be faster on fast or slow turns and that aspect seems random, the tires are random, the pace is random, the AI is random.

Update 1: The game should never have been release in the current state. DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY PATCH.

1. Game will sometimes completely bug out in the middle of the race when changing to either the grid or tire strategy view. It will go blank and then the only way out of the game is to CTRL + ALT + DEL.

2. There will be times when you cannot skip the entire intro when you are loading into game.

3. When you pick your goals for the race, most of the time they do not save properly. For instance, if you check the box for Q3, and then you edit it to select both drivers, then click out of it, when you go back to the main page, it will forget the two drivers and have one. The work around is once you set two drivers, you have to uncheck the box and re-check it. You must always double check all of them because they all are bugged out.

4. Switching views during the race from camera view to any other view can cause it to freeze or bug out where CTRL + ALT + DEL is the only thing that will work.

5. After crashes and/or yellow flags, if you switch to the circuit view at the wrong time the game will freeze and  CTRL + ALT + DEL is the only thing that will work.

Summed up, this game was rushed out and let all of us who bought it take the hit. Save your money until they patch it.",1691438432,1692931947,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

- Driver confidence makes no sense and is game-breaking. If you're a back runner and qualify high, your drivers confidence will be destroyed in a few laps as the pack inevitably gobbles them up. You are better off qualifying last on purpose to gain confidence through overtakes.
- Overtaking lapped cars is stil an issue. If you and an opposing car approach a backmarker, prepare for the backmarker to move aside for your competitor and then block you up for the next 3 laps. It happens every race. Happened in 2022 and was never fix.
- Most importantly, the tires make absolutely no sense. I have tried replaying a few races to just get a basic understanding, as clearly there's more depth than I can gather. To me it seems nearly random. Old hards are out-pacing new softs. 35% softs are regularly hitting fastest lap times. If you've grinded out a 5-6 gap to your closest competitor by managing ERS and tyres, prepare to have that competitor just out of nowhere beat their best lap by 3 seconds and be right behind you. If there's game depth hidden, I'd rather just see it somewhere. Give me one sentence that the Aston Martin on old hards has come alive to explain why my fresh softs are losing 2 seconds a lap to them. I need to be able to be able to see why some cars can run faster lap times when their tyres are 28, because if I can't see the reason I just assume there isn't one and it's random.
- I understand why this mechanic was added, I really do, but I absolutely HATE the new driver AI. The driver AI being able to just randomly attack without warning is fine on paper but these races are 2 hours long and there's a x16 speed to simulate part of the race. You cannot simulate a single lap without risk of them disappearing into the distance. You can dip to an insurmountable 2-5 second gap in one lap if you're not paying attention,. Even on x16 I now have to micro-manage every single lap and that is terribly not fun for the way I play. 

For me, there's not one single thing that was improved upon from 2022. The things I liked are now worse and the things I didn't like still exist. I was going to pass this year as I'm still enjoying 2022, but the FOMO got to me and I thought Vegas might be worth it. I wish I had've not purchased. 2022 scratches the itch I have and 2023 does not.

The game in itself was fun and the patched the game to a pretty decent state, although not a perfect one. I was eager to wait a year and see what Frontier can do with the 2023 Update and well they kinda bottled it.
Not only do we see the same lame crashes that - from the get go - needed an overhaul but also were easy mistakes not fixed. Blocking in Qualifying for example. And to further outline this there are bugs in this game which simply shouldn't happen. How can the KI use only Soft Tyres in a Race? This is a bug that appears so frequent among the community that it really baffles me that this wasn't detected during Play Testing. (Which I hope they had)

The Game needs two major things in order to be enjoyable.
1. Last years games mistakes, bugs must be fixed in order to move the right direction. (Way too frequent Quali Blocking, Crashes must get more realistic, you barely if ever have any start crashes etc.)
2. This years updates need a massive polish. 

And to add a 3rd one that is just a personal request:
F1 2023 has the possibility to use your own team in the ""Career Mode"" why can't we have that in the game that is MORE THAN SUITED for this? If it's because of Copyrights I can highly understand that.

BUT the regression in some areas out weighs the small improvements 

I like playing the lower teams and building them up over time. I have been playing F1 manager games since 2000 and still nothing compares to Microprose's games. The fact that being able to get more sponsors is not in the game amazes me. How can a game from 2000 be more indepth than a game in 2023. Yes i get that graphics have improved and take up a lot of the programming but how about we focus on all aspects of being an F1 manager before we try and make it a fancy looking graphics simulation, that's what the F1 racing game is for 

Don't even bother trying to be one of the lower teams, you'll just get fired. I didn't even make it 1/2 a season with alpha romeo and then once you get fired. thats it you can't go further. Like thats the end of your career as an F1 manager. you'd better not tell Binotto that. 

As I posted last year this is more of management game of click and shot. Not indpeth enough and is broken to think that F1 managers of lower teams would get fired for poor performaces. If that were the case HAAS would have had 10 managers by now.

The cars seem to much on rails for a game with a AAA price.  Even though I have to admit the game is gorgeous, and the new helmet came is pretty cool.

I really wish the drivers had more personality and independence.  One really exciting thing about F1 is when the drivers ignore team orders, and sometimes they get it right, like Carlos Sainz ignored his pitwall to get his first ever win in Silverstone last year.  This game they are robots just waiting for your commands.

Another wish list item, would be for this game to have multiplayer, because they could make up for the sometimes weak AI.

But Driver Moral breaks the game you cant fight your way up in a small team as if you have an amazing qualifying and  end up in p6  you will get overtaken by a couple of big teams and your driver looses all moral and doesnt defend nor try to drive anymore and you get into the loop of dropping all the way down and once your at the bottom of the bord you wont get back up again making qualifying in p15 better then actually qualifying on pole position. WTF where you thinking????????????????? Same with ingame events pit early to get the undercut then there is a race incident and everyone pits and your soft tires are still 90 percent good. It took me 3 laps to go from p2 with daniel riccardo in a haas down to p19 even getting easily outpaced by my teamm8 k.mag on worse tires (hards with 70 percent)...  How bad can you execute a bad idea. I tryed to get my money back but steam said no.

It has a lovely visual design and you can see that there went some thought into the gameplay. 

Sadly, after round about two weeks after release, it still feels ridden with bugs
- game crashed on more than two handful of occasions in races.. feels extra bitter 
- random EMPTY overlays appear in race that block nearly the entire screen so you can't close them and cant interact with the game anymore..
- balance and expectations of teams are not where they should be... -> to just name a few

Plus my very personal two cents, 
I am not interested at all in the 'race replay' nor 'scenario' modes.. ZERO value for me..  I much rather have the option to switch teams (which is atleast around the block) or ffs create my own team (there are talks about new teams joining F1, so it is authentic to add this as a feature). 
Or add a mode where you can start in, i dont know 2000 and go from there, with some historic data.

In addition, the price is WAY too high for what is offered. Full price game, that is merely an add-on of the last years edition with new bugs to fix and if we are lucky more than 3 months worth of further development incoming until every resource goes into the next years 'game'.

Should be 30 bucks max and have an Early Access tag! ..But that would be unfair for games that actually get further proper development (more than handful of months for that state).",1691855747,1691855747,False,3,0,0.509682834148406982,0,True,False,False

Better than F1 Manager 22, however, it's still far from being a proper finished product. Is it still fun? Yes! But I feel that's because there is nothing else to compare it to. Yes, there is Motorsport Manager, which is a great title, but it's dated and needs modernising. Therefore, for me, MM isn't really comparable.

The in-game improvements for F1 Man'23 are numerous, but really should have been applied to the previous game rather than charging Euro/£40-50 and branded as a new game. Way too pricey for what we are getting. Then you are asked for 10-15 more to get ""Special Scenario's"", when to be fair, £15 for the updates, re-skins & '23 roster as an expansion would have been far more fitting. But, like most game developers today, the mantra ""less is more!"" seems to be the standard. Especially when you see how many are spitting their dummies (passifiers) out of the buggy over Baldurs Gate 3. Larian should be applauded for their moral stance and belief.

Anyway, if you don't own an F1 sim you could buy this but if money is short, get Motorsport Manager. 
If you already own last years fare, maybe skip this (unless you really must have the AI improvements) or at least wait until it is heavily discounted.",1691834168,1691834168,True,13,3,0.68139040470123291,0,True,False,False

1. Qualifiying, cars wont move, just silly gameplay, slow running on racing lines and no penealties for it.
2. First 3 laps of the race, AI can run flat out without tire temp penalty.
3. Parts breaking after 3 races, really?
4. The amount of silly crashes destroying cars constantly, thus over cost cap before season is over.
5. Lets not even talk about the penalties. My driver has had grid place penalties every race for 11 races now. Cant even see why he got one, or a replay of the penalty, or stop him from getting them. Destroys good quali and puts you off before the race even starts. Not that it matters, he crashes most of the time anyway. (F1 best drivers in the world?)

There has been no real improvement since this game was released in 2022. The RNG that's under the hood controls everything but not in a natural way. The graphics will show you rapidly approaching the back of another car, and indeed sometimes clipping into them or though other track elements in Monaco with no damage to your car or their (the AI's) car. I can't tell you how many times I've flinched because I was sure that my car going into the back of the other car was going to cause the mother and father of all accidents. But sometimes there is an impossible slow down of the car, or they do touch, but that information is not put back into the game engine for it to handle.

The weekend formats are often wrong, Spa weekend is an example of this where P1 and Q1/2/3 did not happen on the Friday, SQ and Sprint Race did not happen on the Saturday. While I know that was sort of a last minute change, there is an overall problem that the game engine clearly isn't up to the task of being an F1 game at all.

All of that does not even touch the subject of all of the crashes. Null pointer exceptions happening in every gaming sessions, sometimes multiple times, is frankly unacceptable and goes to show the inexperience of the team that is making this game. They should frankly lose their license to the F1 games and someone -- anyone else -- should pick it up because the concept is solid but the execution is flawed. This coupled with the cash grab that was the last game, with the dev team leaving players with no updates around 100 days after release does not give me much hope that this game will go in the correct direction.

If you care at all about your sanity, pass on this game, unless you're a purely hard core F1 fan and need something to do over the summer break.

6 More hours in after this review, and the game and it's saved files have corrupted themselves. Got a safety car in a race that paused the game for the radio message, and now the game will not un-pause itself. I tried loading from a saved game state and all that happens is that I re-load into the safety care situation and the game is still paused. I'm unable to unpause the game at all. ~60 hours of game play will be lost. This is disappointing but hardly unexpected given it's current form. Wait a few months before picking up this game for cheap.

Graphics and and overall look doesn't change much from the 22 version. But from a gameplay and content perpective is more fun and challenging, which is a good thing.

Starting from bottom team and try to get that team to the top is fun. But when you reach the top, it's just a simulation game there you simulates everything and then your team still comes out on top, no need for strategy once you are the top team. I would say that you can get 40-50 hours of this game, but there is nothing more after that.

I also wish there are more customization to the team, for example create your own team, play from F2/F3 and raise your team from there. Create your own driver can also be a greate option.

Regarding the price, I don't think 55€ is a fair price for just 40-50h of gameplay.

Fuel load also mean nothing, ferrai is unrealisticly quick and relieable.
If you change a driver etc, ETC Redbull and haas, hass will instantly be a podium contender and randomizing the entire grid. no matter the cars capabilities.. Which means developing drivers sucks, specially the new way where you can't choose.

Can this be an upgrade version of 2022 sure? But again it's a licensed game you do not like that then don't play it or better do not buy it.

Graphics are pretty terrible by modern standards which isn't a big deal in a management game but it does seem like the kind of visuals we would have expected 7 or 8 years ago. 
The game is harder than last year's. Mostly because the cost cap is now an issue. It's good and adds some balance but I'm still on track to win the Constructors Chapionship in S3 with Haas. So still too easy. Will have to try imposing restrictions on myself next time. 
If you haven't got the previous game, this is a decent purchase. But if you don't care about drivers/teams being perfectly up to date, save money and buy last year's. IMO, 2023 is basically the minor fixes patch that 2022 needed. And if you do care about teams being correct, you'll be bothered after the first season when drivers shift between teams. If you already have last year's game, you probably won't find much value in buying this version. It's the same thing again with slightly less repetitive driver crashes and with a slightly tougher difficulty. 
It seems like once again, if you win a season, you will probably win every season from then onwards. The performance loss compared to the rest of the grid seems to be lower than the 2022 game. So I expect that after winning this season by 50-60pts, I'll probably win every subsequent season but hundreds of points unless I intentionally cripple the car to keep it interesting. 

The two main bugs I'm seeing are that I can't offer my reserve driver a new contract (presumably because he's already signed to the team), so he will leave my team at the end of this season after developing for the last 2 years. And some drivers don't show up on the timing window. So 2 teams at the moment have blank spaces on the left of screen where a driver's name should be. No idea why. Just a visual bug that doesn't matter. But the contract issue is a major issue.

Obviously I did not expect it, but: I have no regrets so far. This is a much more interesting experience than 2022 so far. It's tiny things that keep me coming back so far. By the looks of things there are plenty of reviews going over all of these small things, so I'll just give you what is the biggest improvement for me: It is now possible to let a contract start the next year, and I don't have to fire someone on the spot if I want to improve my team. Such a basic thing for any management title, and I can't believe they got it wrong last year but here we are. It works, and it makes me happy.

For all other small but important improvements, please see other positive reviews.

To me personally it was clear that this was always going to be a yearly released title, comparable to titles like Football Manager and Cycling Manager. But the way this was handled by Frontier was just incredibly stupid, with an anger inducing message going out and a rectification that caused even more anger once the 2023 iteration was announced. The yearly release can be defended, but the lack of transparency can absolutely not be defended. I have to think of a Dutch proverb here: ""Gentle healers make stinking wounds"". By not being clear about their intentions in the first place, they received much hate by being who somehow thought it would be viable for a developer to keep support up for an application that was supposed to be deprecated by this new iteration./

I do feel there is too many annoying alerts like;
1. X is overtaking Y or too much watching of track action
2. There has been an accident/spin which has no impact like activating VSC/SC/Red Flag
3. DRS de/activated
4. ERS is charged/depleted.  I would of had some sort of option that you can tell the drivers to use full deployment of ERS for 2 laps then cool/recharge and then attack for 2 laps again.  Drivers shouldn't need to be told when to use/harvest ERS.   
When you're playing this on 16x speed, it's just annoying to keep pressing to change speed again.

The micro managing of the pit crew is so blooming tedious.  I'm yet to get fastest pit stop or even getting points.  No matter if I follow the recommended pit crew schedule or tell them to focus on certain things, it just doesn't appear to do anything.  The sporting director is always on low moral because of this, doesn't appear to be anything else I can do!  Surely the department manager should be dealing with all of this.  The Pit Stops should happen automatically on the scheduled lap unless you change it during the race.

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

I'm disappointed to say that F1® Manager 2023 just doesn't hit the mark for me. I've found the gameplay to be tedious and lacking in the excitement I'd hoped for from a racing management game. It feels hastily put together, with noticeable bugs that impede the experience.

Additionally, the game seems poorly balanced. The teams and cars don't seem to be on an even playing field, which takes away from the competitive spirit I love in this genre.

To anyone considering this game, I'd personally recommend giving [b]Motorsport Manager[/b] by Playsport Games a shot instead. Even after all this time, it remains a thoroughly enjoyable racing management game that delivers where F1 Manager 2023 unfortunately falls way short.",1691094048,1691094048,False,5,0,0.448772519826889038,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-AI much improved - examples: AI doing laps before rain hits in qualifying, AI pitting for late safety cars even if the strategy they were originally on could make it to the end, AI actually uses ERS, Fuel modes, Pushes tyres etc. Makes it much more enjoyable when racing. AI also improves their cars as fast as you do.

-Tyre temperatures are actually a thing PLUS the temperature of the track and the air can affect your tyre temps quite a lot. I had a 15 degrees celsius practice session in Australia and even when going aggressive on the tyres, they would never overheat. However when the temperature hits 30, it's totally different. You have to go light on the tyres every so often to not have them overheat. I haven't experienced extremes beyond these two yet but they can happen.

-WAY HARDER THAN THE PREVIOUS VERSION. You will definitely hit the cost cap easily if you aren't careful. You can't spam intense or emergency parts anymore without taking a massive chunk out of the money you can spend. AI develops cars as fast as you, you need to fiddle around with the sliders when designing car parts as potentially leaving it on balanced won't allow you to catch up to the other cars as fast as you would like. Maybe focus on dirty air tolerance one time, maybe drs effectiveness another time. Maybe engine cooling another time etc. Seems more logical right now. Right now I am last with Alfa Romeo in Imola with zero points and my target is 7TH, we'll see if I get sacked or not but it definitely helps upgrading the board room for extra board confidence and not going into the red money wise.

-Old sprint races, could be a negative as it isn't the new sprint shootout format but i can't blame them for not having it as it was implemented too late for them to react. 

-They have the new Quali format used in Imola (cancelled IRL so that was moved to Monza I believe) and Hungary. Hards in Q1, Medium in Q2, Soft in Q3. Nice to see.

-Emergency events, I have a had a few of these where you have to make a decision. Examples being: Faults in a department and you need to either shut the whole thing down (resulting in 10 days where you can't manufacture parts etc.) or you risk it and hope it doesn't get worse. Another being conflict between driver and engineer, you can intervene and potentially make things better or worse, or you leave it be and cause the driver to be more aggressive in race and loose affinity between driver and engineer. These events have made my save so much harder too as I have lost a lot of time being able to upgrade the car at certain races because I couldn't manufacture parts for days. It's a great addition.

Cons:
-I had a race in Baku where there was 3 red flags in the first 20 laps or so. The race eventually finished after about 2 and a half hours of in-game racing. However I noticed the weather didn't update after a certain amount of time. The weather and the temps stayed the same for over half the race. Maybe they don't simulate far enough right now? Or the red flags bugged it out, not sure. Hope they fix that.

-No mechanical failures.

-Maybe too many racing incidents, especially in practice with collisions happening between drivers too frequently. However that could make up for no mechanical failures in the game. Not that much of a big deal as it spices up the races.

-AI maybe too fast at the beginning of races? Haven't played enough to see if it's a reoccurring thing as your car gets better. Will update as time goes on.

Conclusion:
It's hard to note every positive and negative off the top of my head but I will  update if I remember some. It's a fantastic game and a massive improvement over the first. I actually have so much more fun in this game than the last and the saves will be fun for a longer period of time. BE PREPARED FOR A CHALLENGE IN RACE AND OUT OF THE RACE. AI better, Temps noticeably make a difference.

9/10 for me personally. Last game was probably a 5 because of how boring it got quickly into a save. No longer the case in this game.

To Bruce Garrido, I watched the video (not in full, and at increased speed). Here is what i noted and for what you charge 60 euro this year.

New things:
+ ""Reworked everything"" - sure... even widescreen UI mode is not working.
+ F2 and F3 simulation - I think its nice, to see some sort of proof or evidence why certain drivers develop or not. It was in previous game and had to be simulated somehow but nice you guys add an UI feature this time.
+ UI reworked - you guys display tire temperature now and bunch of new sim engine parameters.
+ Pit stops mechanics - nicer graphic and official DHL sponsor. There is a new member of staff that allows you to develop mechanics + train them. More UI changes rather than new addition, as I remember there was a way to increase effectiveness of your pit crew.
+ UI change of development of drivers/staff where now you chose focus of their development rather than an RPG style point allocation.
+ You can switch teams/get fired. Shocker! In management game?! Revolutionary.
+ Confidence mechanic... Another UI display of error chance.

To sum up. The developers decided to show more of their code in terms of UI changes. The things I mentioned and devs say in the video, to some extent had to be in previous game. Pit stop, confidence/error/success rate, tire performance etc had to somehow be simulated. Through some math equation and parameters. They now make them visible to us and try to trick us that they are newly added to the simulation engine. Either way its a loss loss situation. Either previous sim engine were ridiculously simple or you just try to lie. 

This is my opinion and I guess EA/Frontier do not agree with it. 
First of all I do believe that its not a fault of hard working employees of these companies. Its a management issue and development plan. You simply can't improve a game on a yearly basis. I do believe that we will actually get a decent game at the end of the 2025 (end of their initial release plan agreed with F1 license owner - Liberty Media). This is the game they target to be great. 

IDEA for better sim engine:
Make tire performance non-linear. Its impossible to have soft tire degrade linearly. Ask any tire manufacturer. For heavens sake you have another EA F1 game that actually works with F1 teams and they developed non-linear tire performance. Use it! 



[OLD]
This game is in worst shape then the previous one on the release... The greed of these people... 

Don't buy it yet, wait for the sale. Racing engine is the same, they added some parameters for us to play which probably were already in the sim engine as a constant for every team. Nothing is new tbh, except Qatar and Las Vegas.

I would love to talk to one of the producers or game developers and simply ask if they are happy with the product for which they charge 60 euro...

THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A SEQUEL TO A YEARLY TITLE.
Everything they've changed is better. It looks better, the flow when the cars are moving and when ""stopping unexpectedly"" are better, the simulation is better, the radio is better.
The practice sessions are more fun with the change of how the ""optimal range"" is shown. The races are more intriguing with the changes to driver confidence and attack and defend orders. The part development is more interesting with part health and inspections. 
No MTX, no season pass, no FOMO, just fun.

Now, I haven't given much time to the Race Replay and Scenarios because it isn't my focus, but I'm sure they will come in clutch after I have gotten tired of the career mode. When you got tired of career mode in F1M22 the game was over.

Only negatives I've seen so far is that the cars still turn rather sharply now and then, the (very pretty) helmet cam moves too far from side to side to be realistic and the cars shake back and forth when battling, which breaks immersion somewhat, but they are all cosmetic issues.

I am in love with this game, even more than last years. If they keep this up, this franchise will be the best management series ever.

They even got the weird Qualifying rules for some of the races where they must use Hards in Q1 and Meds in Q2. Sprint format is last year's but that's okay, the rules were changed late.

There some things that need tweaking. The cars are still kind of jittery out there and do a few weird things, but less than last year. Certainly not perfect, but I look forward to their continued improvements in the years to come, and this year too.

There's some menu bugs and such too.

There's also many additions they could still add to the game that haven't made it yet. One day I hope to see the changes to a design when you upgrade, perhaps you can pick from a few designs for a part.

More TV style stuff. Maybe formation lap or partial one to build up some suspense. More spray from Cars in Wet weather. Calendar changes in subsequent seasons, maybe being able to add old or new tracks to a schedule and stuff to keep it fresh over a long career.

Introduction:
Alright, rev up your engines and put on your funniest racing helmets because F1 Manager 23 has hit the circuits, and it's ready to tickle your funny bone! Forget about the serious-faced pit crews; this game brings hilarity to the high-speed world of Formula 1 management. It's like a comedy show on wheels, and I can't stop giggling like a school kid in the middle of a serious board meeting!

Graphics and Sound (9/10):
Prepare to be visually tickled pink! The graphics are so sharp and detailed that you can almost see the sweat on the drivers' brows as they speed through the tracks. And let's not forget about the sound effects—brilliant! The engines growl like an irritated bear, and the crowd cheers louder than your mom at your graduation. It's an audiovisual extravaganza that'll leave you in stitches.

Gameplay and Controls (10/10):
Managing an F1 team has never been this hilarious! It's like trying to herd cats through a tightrope walk. The gameplay is a perfect balance of chaos and strategy. You'll find yourself yelling at your drivers like they can hear you, ""Left! No, right! I said pit stop, not picnic!"" The controls are so smooth that you'll feel like a pro, even when your decisions make the cars spin like a DJ on a turntable.

Content and Depth (9.5/10):
Buckle up, because F1 Manager 23 has more content than a clown car! It's got the whole shebang—the 2023 season, legendary drivers, and even some old-school F1 history to unlock. It's like a treasure chest full of funny surprises. The depth of the game will have you saying, ""Just one more race"" until the sun rises like a missed alarm on a Monday morning.

Realism (9/10):
Now, this is where F1 Manager 23 shows its comedy chops. The realism is like a circus act—it's there, but it's not taking itself too seriously. The AI drivers have their quirks, and you'll see some hilarious accidents that'll make you wonder if they took driving lessons from Mr. Bean. But hey, who needs realism when you're having this much fun?

Community and Multiplayer (8.5/10):
The multiplayer mode is a barrel of laughs! Compete against other players worldwide and see whose pit stops are as slow as a sloth taking a nap. The community is like a group of carnival-goers, all there for a good time and ready to share laughs and tips. It's like having a racing party that never ends!

Microtransactions (8/10):
Fear not, my fellow comedy lovers! While microtransactions are present, they won't force you to pay your life savings for a virtual racing car. The in-game currency flows like a river of laughter, and you can progress just fine without opening your wallet. Spend wisely, though, unless you want your bank account to pull a disappearing act like a magician's rabbit.

Conclusion:
F1 Manager 23 is a hilarious rollercoaster ride through the wacky world of Formula 1 management. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and invites you to join the fun with open arms. With its eye-catching graphics, entertaining gameplay, and a community that's more fun than a clown convention, F1 Manager 23 is a must-play for anyone who needs a good laugh with their racing adrenaline. So, hop on board, and let the laughter engines roar!",1690874350,1690874350,True,1,0,0.447126954793930054,0,True,False,False

I've had to Alt+F4 out of three races so far because switching data views bricks the whole UI and makes so you can't click anything.  They also didn't make any improvements from last year.  The practice sessions are worthless as car set-ups don't improve your pace at all. 

Driver attributes are a huge crap shoot as well.  I'm managing McLaren and despite Oscar staying competitive with Lando this season he qualifies P19 or P20 every race.  Before my last race crashed after two laps Oscar was 2 seconds behind DeVries in P20.

In short the game this year is an absolute joke and its clear the devs are just cashing a check from F1 and don't actually care to make a decent product given they just stamped a fresh coat of paint on last years game and called it good.

From P3, Stroll is planning a 2 stop, (S) (M) (M) while Alonso starts on (M) and hopes to invert Stroll's strategy.

Stroll and Hamilton come together in turn 2 as Perez just sneaks by Alonso before the SC call. The Stroll-Hamilton collision collects Magnussen as well as causing a pileup involving both Alpines and both Ferraris, as well as a Williams. Max manages to scoot by unscathed.

So, 3 turns in it is Perez, Alonso, Hamilton, Verstappen... and then a mess. Hamilton at least appears to have gotten a 5 sec penalty for causing the collision with Stroll, so that's something? Stroll has major chassis, front wing, and suspension damage, and minor rear wing damage. I'm going to retire the car because there's no way I'm keeping that alive for 50 laps, I'd rather focus on Alonso's race and hopefully not damage his car too.

On the replay, looks like Hamilton just drifted wide into Stroll, knocking him off the course and causing the pileup behind while remaining totally unscathed. A red flag is called due to the size of the pileup.

Lap 3: Alonso thinks about diving up the inside of T1 on the restart but Perez defends well, Alonso stays in 2nd. Max is now right behind him by turn 5, Hamilton just behind him. Gasly and Leclerc are fighting behind, while Albon splits the second Ferrari of Sainz. I have Alonso on maxiumum everything to try to either get ahead of Perez or at least hold off Max for awhile, to see if we can. If he just gets by with no trouble then I'll just focus on extending the stint and going from there. Considering a '1' stop of these scrubbed (S) onto a new set of (H); alternatively adding a jump back onto (M) / (S) if the (H) don't have the pace.

Perez is also on full push and has gapped Alonso 2 seconds in a lap. Well, shit. Going to tell him to not fight Max too hard then and instead focus on extending the stint. Leclerc has quickly passed Gasly and Hamilton, and is now harassing Max. Maybe that'll keep Max from passing Alonso, but as DRS enables this coming lap that seems unlikely. Sainz has also managed to get past Albon/Gasly/Hamilton - Ferrari seems to have some pace on race day today. 

Lap 6: Max breezes by Alonso with DRS on the main straight. The pair of Ferraris are now behind, and seem like they might have better pace than us unfortuntately. We should be able to stay ahead of the Merc at least based on Hamilton having fallen down close to 2 seconds on Sainz already. Maybe he has damage from the touch with Stroll but just didn't retire.

Interestingly, Max isn't on full push right now - Alonso on regular pace is actually staying on Max's tail through the full lap after he was passed, even while also topping off energy. By the start of L8 Gasly is by Hamilton now, so he definitely is off the pace. 

Alonso dives around the outside of Max into T1! Fantastic move, though Max fights back through the middle sector. Going into the 2nd DRS zone Alonso is ahead though! Perez is 2.5 seconds away, slowly closing - must be backed off from his earlier gap building.

Max is trying to get back ahead of Alonso but through L9 he's staying ahead. Lap 10 starts and Max once again opens that DRS flap, but can't quite pull ahead. He stays alongside Alonso through T1 but Alonso manages to pull out ahead, being on aging but still grippy softs compared to Max's slipperier mediums.

Lap 11: Alonso once again fights Max into T1-2 and just barely stays ahead, to fight another lap. Perez is a steady 3 seconds clear again, but not pulling away any further - we're genuinely in the fight on pace, even if a little high deg compared to Max and Perez currently.

Max just doesn't quite have the top end to get by us even with DRS, most of the time! We took a page from Williams and have been focusing on being very slippery with our latest upgrade packages - seems to be paying off.

Lap 13: Max shoulders his way by through the final few corners, pulling ahead of Alonso into the final turn. 

Max is already within DRS on Perez now and so too is Alonso with Max! It's a DRS train from 1-5 now, 1st is genuinely up for grabs for whoever can take it here.

Lap 17: Max passes Perez on the main straight, telling Alonso to deploy some energy and see if he can have a go at Perez too. Next lap, Tsunoda locks up into 10 but doesn't hit the wall - the last few races it seems like him and De Vris + Zhou and Bottas have been playing bumper cars.

Perez fights back alongside Max through the beginnings of L18 but Max ends up ahead by the midpoint of the lap. Alonso is still hanging onto Perez's DRS and has nearly extended the gap to Leclerc to a second but is low on battery now so needs to harvest.

We overfueled by a lap intending to push from the start, so between that and the red flag, we've been on full push fuel-wise since the beginning - that's probably been helping us stay on the RB's, though they've now broken DRS. Alonso is complaining about the tires.

Lap 20: We're the only ones to pit so far, with a 2.567s stop bringing us out into 9th just ahead of De Vries, behind Albon. We have a 4 second gap to Albon so we're going to take advantage of the clean air and push for a bit.

Lap 22: Perez and both Ferraris (double stack? that's brave) pit but Max stays out. On our first full lap on fresh (M) we manage a 1.17.619 - compared to Max's recent laps which have been in the 1:19s, we should be able to start closing this gap and really work this undercut. We indeed pass by Perez as he exits the pits, promoting us to effective second place. 23.7 seconds to Max - if we can nail the next lap or two, we're in this.

Lap 23: We get by Hülkenberg into T1, closing the gap to Max, reeling him down to 21.9 now. Hulk held us up a bit last lap, so we should close in under 20 seconds by the end of this one if all goes well.

Lap 27: While the gap to Max is 15.2, Perez unfortunately slides through around the outside of 1 into the inside of 2, going to see if we can tail him and use his pace + DRS to stay ahead of the Ferraris again. Alonso fights back through 3 and comes out ahead, before Perez takes the inside of 4 and passes again. What a back and forth!

Lap 30: Perez breaks out of DRS range through L29, so Alonso is wide open on the first straight for Leclerc to sweep by. Sainz is 11 seconds down however so he's not a concern for the moment. Leclerc is on the same tires as Perez, so hopefully the two of them will wear through them soon and Alonso can mount a comeback attempt towards the end of this stint.

GODDAMNIT

Leclerc ends up with less momentum than I expected - stays alongside Alonso into T1, where he ever so graciously spins Alonso and sends himself into the gravel trap. Alonso doesn't seem to have any race-ending damage, only what appears to be a slow leak - front right tyre down to 29% while the rest are still at 70%. We'll need to limp around a full lap then slap on a set of hards and go to the end, I suppose. Fuck.

GOD-DAMN-IT

It looked like an issue with my video card (game asked me about drivers etc) or maybe my PC is already too old... not sure. 

But it works perfectly on my PS5 which nis what i have used over the weekend to enjoy a new start with Alfa Romeo.

There are lots of upgrade from 22 on top of the well known and advertised ones overall it feels even more immersive.
Once they fix stability issues and maybe performances it should be enjoyable for all.

- AI crazy quick during opening laps (A driver in Medium could easily overtake your driver in soft)
- Unrealistic board expectations
- There are either SC, VSC, or someone being given 5s penalty EVERY race
- More minor kinks that makes it irritating to play for hours

The improvements though are nice. Race Engineers have more moments to talk to your driver. Plus the driver cam view is as immersive as it look on videos. Most importantly, the AI reacts more with their strategies, requiring players to be more attentive throughout the race.

I believed in Frontier devs. I was hoping they would fix (next) game. But *spoiler* — no.

I would like to express my support for UI designers. They improved the already good UI design of last (22) game. And visually, game looks attractive. That's nice.

But programmers and game designers of this game... their game is just slag. Simulation of the practice, quali, race, AI teams and other remained just as terrible. JUST AWFUL. Already from stage 2-3 it just hurts you to play this game, if you want some realistic stuff (and some stuff with mods you can't fix that, how that was possible in last year game). I will never buy a game from these devs again and I will not advise you if they (devs) don't care so much about balance, game testers (for testing bugs or other stupid things) and realism in a Formula 1 game.

1) Balance. It's just terrible, the cars, like last year, follow each other without any problems. As a result, in race 5 cars can easily fit in 1 second for several laps. And drivers drives too sleek - spread is only 0.2s per lap. By teammates and by several laps. I mean, if you have Ocon and Gasly with several skills you will have almost same lap time in quali (0.0-0.2s dif). And so it is in all fast laps attempts. And in quali there is no evolution of the track. NO TRACK EVOLUTION. Best lap time in q1 easily can be faster than in q3.... but haha, only for 0.0-0.1 second. I have no words. There are still problems with balance, but it looks like the devs just don't give a shit about it all.

2) Game mechanics. Personally, I'm interested. I like to tune the car. But not all mechanics in game are good, for example mechanics - driver control is controversial. For example, due to the lack of testers from devs, I found one cheesing method in quali, this works great for Azerbaijan track - you have to push in advance, before a fastlap (just before long straight), so your driver will be faster 0.3-0.5s in fast lap. AI don't do so, as result you're cheater. It's cheating. But it's game problem, devs problem, not my. I mean, wtf, Frontier, why you just not tested the game? Answer me, please.

3) AI just sucks. It looks a little better than in last year game (AI tyre strategies looks like little better), but overall still sucks. To be honest, I don't see the point in explaining why, if the devs don't give a shit about AI and other things... And even more so, I don't know why, but there are fewer opportunities for modding (for example, to lower the slipstream, drag, drs effect, tyres modding and so on). If the devs did this intentionally, then congratulations, you have found a new enemy. Not a fan.

I'm deleting the game from my pc. I hope the sales of this game will be terrible, like last time. Perhaps then devs will think about changing priorities. But for some reason I don't believe it.",1690815590,1690817267,False,343,11,0.833796560764312744,30,True,False,False

It's also much more difficult compared to the previous games with a whole bunch of new things to manage such as durability on parts which means you have to be a lot more efficient with manufacturing of parts. The AI is also a lot better so much more efficient management and race strategy will be required. It's not as difficult as some may say if you have a good understanding of last years game as I've managed 2 wins in the first 5 races with Mercedes.

Overall absolutely recommend for new or returning players as it's a big step up and hopefully we'll see more with updates in the coming months.
