I was afraid that after playing Black Mesa I would be too turned off by the dated graphics from a game released in 1998 however, that was not the case. Black Mesa is incredible and the devs did phenomenal job re-creating half life, but I actually like this OG game better. Half Life is simply a classic. You know how they make you read timeless works of literature in school to appreciate what good writing is? That is what Half Life is to gaming. This game has had so much influence on the games we have played over the years that it deserves a play through for any FPS fan out there.

It was revolutionary for the time, and arguably still has better and more advanced ai then many Triple-A games today.

The game is packed full of content, with intricate levels full of diverse enemies and secret loot areas.

Though I do highly recommend this game, I must warn the reader of the last few levels, which are rather rushed and mostly unpolished, and you may find them very irritating.

But the game itself more than makes up for it with the rest of it's stellar level/enemy design, which honestly in some ways is still better then the sequel

Somehow I had never played the original Half-Life. I loved HL2 and its two Episodes, but I had never played HL. So I finally took the time to go back and play it, and it shocked me how well it stands the test of time. Obviously the graphics are outdated, just as so many other technological aspects of the game are, but from an overall gameplay perspective, it's still fun and it still feels good. 


But perhaps even more surprising is just how far ahead of its time this game was. So many modern FPS tropes came from here.

I've always loved 2004's Doom 3 because of how innovative and inventive the game was, but after playing Half-Life, my admiration for Doom 3 has ticked down a tad because I now see that so many of the ideas that I thought originated there were actually born 6 years earlier in Half-Life. So many of the segments and story beats and level types came straight out of Half-Life, just with more of a horror/ambiant feel added for Doom 3.

The only thing that actually feels dated to me (besides the visuals) in Half-Life, is the ladder climbing. The way ladders work is loose and annoying to navigate, as it's easy to come at them on an angle and fall off the side, leading to annoying fall damage.
Also, the final boss was a major annoyance. The last few levels in general weren't great. But everything else holds up extremely well and more importantly, is fun to play. The same CANNOT be said of most other shooters from that era.

If I had played this game upon release in 1998, I'd easily give it a 90% or perhaps even a 95% review score. But I played it in December 2023, not 1998. And even 25 years later, I'm still giving it a 75%, which is incredibly impressive for such an old game.

Half-Life is a game that needs no introduction. It revolutionized the FPS genre, won over 50 GOTY awards and has retrospectively been viewed as one of the greatest video games of all time. Everyone in the gaming community already knows just how influential Half-Life was and still is, but I wanted to explain why via this review (and of course to gush about one of my favorite games ever made).

Review:
As I said before, Half-Life is revolutionary because of how different it was from other FPS games. While games like Doom and Quake were pure shooters, Half-Life's gameplay is more varied. Half-Life integrates combat and puzzles into a unified package, both of which are well-designed. There is also a huge variety of weapons and enemies that make each encounter feel distinct from the other. Each encounter requires you to think about how to defeat enemies, adding an extra layer of inginuity to an action-packed experience.

Not only is the gameplay amazing, but so is the overall presentation. Upon release, Half-Life's visuals were considered impressive for its detailed character animations and immersive environments. Even though Half-Life's visuals have certainly aged by modern standards, I still think they are impressive and carry a unique charm. The character designs, particularly the Xen creatures, are creative and the environments have so much attention to detail, already adding to Half-Life's immersive atmosphere.

Half-Life's narrative broke grounds for how games tell stories. Half-Life's plot is simple. A resonance cascade occurs, destroying the Black Mesa research facility, killing its scientists and it's up to Gordon Freeman to stop it. Pretty generic plot, isn't it? However, the way Half-Life told said story is incredible. For the entire game, the player's view never leaves Freeman's eyes and plot details are told through scripted events instead of cutscenes. I love this approach to narrative as I truly feel immersed into the game's world.

However, despite all of Half-Life's achievements, it's not without its flaws. There is one aspect of Half-Life that's bad, Xen. Half-Life's final few chapters take place in the alien borderworld of Xen. Xen's level design ranges from okay to awful. The seemless blend of combat and puzzles in the previous chapters is replaced by repetitive platforming. The enemy placement is cheap and the final boss is very easy once you know how to beat it. I dislike Xen; not only does it leave an amazing game on a sour note, but also wastes so much potential.

Final Verdict:
Despite a disappointing final act, Half-Life is amazing and also one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay is unique, the visuals are charming and the way it tells its story is downright incredible. Half-Life is a masterpiece and one of the best titles in the FPS genre I've ever played, ever. I would recommend everyone who calls themselves a gamer to play Half-Life at least once.

I will start off with my major issue with this game, the controls. they feel like walking in a pool while the floor is covered with dish washer soap, you will be slipping all over the place and the slightest movement gives you uncontrollable momentum, and BTW, you will need to platform occasionally to progress further. Second issue is there is zero guidance other than what NPCs tell you to do, and if you miss it, you can't have them tell you what your objective is again, however, the game is linear and is straight forward but at times can just feel cryptic (will not give examples to avoid spoilers). There are some other minor issues but I don't want to be unfair to this game since it came out decades ago so to summarize, unless you don't mind getting stuck wondering what to do every now and then and you don't find awkward controls to be an issue then you might enjoy this game, but otherwise just watch a play through on you tube if you are interested in its story.

Twenty-six years after first laying my hands on this iconic game, I've finally conquered its challenges and emerged victorious. It's been a long road, filled with nostalgia, frustration, and ultimately, triumph.

I remember being just a kid of 8 or 9 when I first experienced the groundbreaking world of Half-Life. Even at that young age, I was captivated by its immersive storytelling and innovative gameplay mechanics. But, like many youngsters of the time, I struggled to progress beyond the initial levels. The game felt daunting, its puzzles perplexing, and its enemies formidable. Then, at age 10, I made another attempt, but still, the later stages proved too daunting for my inexperienced gaming skills.

But now, armed with years of gaming experience and a determination to revisit this classic, I embarked on my journey through Half-Life once more. As I navigated the intricate corridors of the Black Mesa Research Facility, I found myself rediscovering the awe and wonder that had captivated me all those years ago. The game's seamless integration of storytelling and gameplay kept me engaged at every turn, with scripted sequences seamlessly driving the plot forward without ever breaking the immersive first-person perspective.

The puzzles, which once seemed insurmountable, now presented welcome challenges that tested my problem-solving skills. Whether it was navigating a maze of conveyor belts or using environmental hazards to dispatch enemies, each puzzle felt like a satisfying victory once overcome. And the addition of the long jump module added a new dimension to the gameplay, requiring precise timing and skillful maneuvering to navigate the platformer-style jumping puzzles of Xen.

But perhaps the greatest challenge awaited me near the end of the game, as I faced off against the formidable Nihilanth. As I journeyed through the alien-infested landscapes of Xen, I could feel the tension building with each step closer to my final confrontation. The Nihilanth's lair was a sight to behold, a sprawling cavernous expanse that served as the backdrop for our epic showdown.

And what a showdown it was. The Nihilanth tested my skills like never before, with its devastating attacks and formidable defenses pushing me to the brink of defeat. But I refused to give up, drawing on every ounce of determination and skill I had acquired throughout my journey. And finally, after a grueling battle that seemed to stretch on for an eternity, I emerged victorious, the Nihilanth vanquished and the portal to Xen sealed once and for all.

As I watched the credits roll and the iconic theme music filled the air, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction wash over me. I had finally accomplished what seemed impossible all those years ago, and my inner child rejoiced at the triumphant conclusion of this epic adventure. Half-Life will always hold a special place in my heart, not just as a groundbreaking piece of gaming history, but as a timeless classic that has brought joy and inspiration to gamers of all ages.",1704844942,1708041857,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

When one challenge is exhausted, a new one presents itself right around the corner, and this feeling never leaves until the credits roll.

70,158196643,76561198345071069,1358,17,459,0,459,1707785537,"Half-Life originally came out when I was in middle school, and though I remember buying it maybe a year or two later, that was only to play Counter-Strike. Remember those days when mods were full-fledged games, sometimes better than the game they were modded on? Common practice has become a rare circumstance now.

That said, I don't think I ever actually played it! In 1997, I rented FFVII and for a few years soaked up every JRPG I could find and had time to play. So, now in 2024, playing through Half-Life for the first time is a... challenge. I respect the absolute hell out of this game for what it did to the FPS genre and the larger impact it's had on narrative-driven games, but man... it's rough... Kudos must be given because I was able to run the original non-source version with little to no tweaking needed. Turn off the head-bob though; it's by far the most extreme case of it in any game I can think of.

Any visual media that's over two decades old will certainly show age, so you have to accept that. Visually, you see the limits pushed in some of these levels, especially some of the cliff-side ones. The character models, though few, do the job. But where the game does shine is the alien enemies. Lord, they did some good work on making nightmare fuel when they created these ones.

I think the No-Clip documentary on the creative process of Half-Life helps immensely to try and frame the release window around what it was like at the time. A fully connected game world was pretty much unheard of in 1998, and Half-Life succeeds in that quite well. If there weren't the chapter popups, then sometimes you wouldn't even realize you've started a new section. This is the big impact that Half-Life leaves on the gaming industry, narration through the character's eyes, in a complete package.

This game is freakin' HARD. I'm not kidding (or I'm bad, maybe a mix of both!) when I say that. I truly think there were more deaths than a Dark Souls playthrough. The combat is tight, but the human enemies must have five layers of kevlar on because they take a punch before they go down. There's a decent variety of weaponry, including alien and tech ones, and figuring out which to use versus which enemies is part of the puzzle.

Half-Life has a banger soundtrack, but sadly, we don't get enough of it!

Speaking of puzzles, the game features countless platforming sections that act as the puzzles found in this title. Most were self-explanatory after a bit of tooling around, but a couple are downright wicked. Even though I was frustrated with a few, it's nice to mix up the combat that becomes a bit mundane after killing your 100th headcrab, and they are paced fairly well, though the later third of the game features some REALLY annoying ones.

I think I'll dive into Blue Shift and Opposing Force before continuing with Half-Life 2. I'm giving HL1 a 4/5 but can see how this was a 10/10 game back in '98.",1707786676,1707786676,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that being said, the first three quarters of this game is amazing, it's a blast from beginning to that point, but when you get to Lambda is when this game becomes a shit show, infinite spawning enemies in a certain point in the labs making moving around annoying, A portal puzzle (before actual Portal was made which did It far superior.) that relies on trail and error meaning quicksave after quicksave. Xen... eugh don't even get me started about Xen, it slows to a crawl until the nice little difficulty spike, then the final boss. Do not let me lead you away from this game, because it really should be played by EVERYONE it's just one of those classic games, that one day in the future will hopefully be displayed in a museum along side Resident Evil 2 and Tekken 3. It's a fun time, and did I mention it's only $10 USD (and it goes on sale with its expansions very often)? kinda hard to say no to a game for that price that is amazing, Not to mention it's expansions are pretty solid too, Opposing Forces being the best one.

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I

Watch it count down to the end of the day

Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know

Surprisingly it holds up well,  I noticed many features that likely set it apart from the crowd back in its release years. Given this was Valve’s debut title, I think it’s noteworthy how all it takes is some people with good ideas to make something pretty special and change an industry. 

Also, I played Black Mesa (the acclaimed fan remake) first and only after finishing it did I play through the original. I suppose I see it like visiting a movie theater (BM) over a vhs (HL). They’re still great regardless by themselves, and it’s important not to forget what came before us. If you are choosing which one to play first, I believe you could go with either and just have more appreciation for the other one if you choose to play that too.

The combat loop is tight and inherintly fast paced with methodology of ""Run, Think, Shoot and Live"" through encounter to encounter. Fighting against aliens and against soldiers is exhilarating; two different factions with two different strategies that you need to approach accordingly.

The pacing of the campain, or at least the overworld section, is one of the best made. Escaping the failing facility through it's different sectors, finding survivors and discovering more and more about the facility we worked with. Activating last resort prevention of alien invasion and surviving the warzone to get to the Lambda facility is some of the best sections of the game.

Some of the best shooting campaings next to Half Life 2, Doom Eternal and Titanfall 2 and would have been perfect if not for the Xen chapters.

Xen feels like an afterthought in otherwise easiest 10/10 shooting experience possible I could give. Confusing layout, pacing halts to the snail's pace - especially in Interlopers chapter, complete lack of any resources to survive anything except from some random dead scientists' stash, drab color scheme reminding me of various color of vomit and textures of vein holes, which might have awakened Trypophobia in some of people.
Imagine if there was an alternative game where Xen was not bad...

Regardless, it is still worth playing, at least until the Xen starts.",1707239177,1707239177,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You play as Gordon Freeman, a physicist who....well, I think anyone who hasn't been living in a cave in the wilds of Mongolia knows what happens next.  By the way, some people kvetch about Xen, but I'm going to go against the grain and say that I have never had a problem with the level set.  So there.

Valve has recently released a souped up version of the game for its 30th anniversary, with modern graphics options, bug fixes, and more.

Positives:

-Gameplay-  While it may drag a little in some sequences, this is pretty much the pinnacle of FPS shooting and story-telling, with enemy AI that is still remarkable, and an incredibly diverse cast of monstrous and human opposition as well as supporting cast.  Awesome gun-play with a now sacrosanct group of weapons as well as a few surprises.

-Music/SFX-  Seminal and in many ways unsurpassed.

-Graphics/Textures/Models-  All right, so some of these look a little dated, but I'd still rather look around Black Mesa and Xen than some more modern, high-poly, graphics card melting environments.


Meh:  Overlapping dialogue with multiple characters on the screen and the repetition of character models (you can't tell me that it didn't somewhat break immersion for you when there were multiple copies of Barney running around, just as an example).

This is my second time playing it, and like the first time bugs weren't already bad enough, they are MUCH worse now.
Instead of making the 30th anniversary update, how about you fix the game valve ?
A lot of game breaking bugs, like getting stuck somewhere, enemies killing you through walls, getting into game event where you HAVE to fall, but you don't have enough hp, so you have to try to break the game, things not opening/working, so you have to load 200 saves before in order to fix it.

The game is great, one of the best games that I have ever played, but these bugs are unforgivable, even for this old game.

To this day the game is well thought out, engaging, the story is fun and immersive. I'm having a blast replaying it again for my followers on Twitch Greydrak3. The story teaches you the basics of movement, cover, situational awareness and precision keyboard and mouse control. It's as much a tutorial for the 'in's and out's' of first person shooting as it is a challenge to play through to see how the story pans out.

It's a great retro game, and being a Gen-X gamer a fun one to hone my skills and just enjoy the fun story telling ride. We know there's an Area 51. Half=Life asks the question, what's in the other 50 areas? Black Mesa is a fun exploration of what exactly might be down in those D.U.M.B.s.

The graphics are blocky, but the controls are tight. A great way to warm up for other modern FPS.

This game is what helped put Steam on the map. It's worth checking out what all the hype was about.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The graphics were ahead of their time. As a game from 1998, this blows me away. Half-Life was a benchmark in terms of graphics and performance and it still shows. This game has obviously aged, but put me in a time machine to 1998 this game would make me speechless! Sharp graphics and a simple UI really makes this game stand out and still looks pleasant on the eye.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]I will say that the gameplay is amazing! It’s fast and smooth and aged pretty well for a 1998 title. The gunplay is really fun and you can use some really unique and fun weapons in this game. You can fight a ton of different enemies that require strategy and I love that difficulty. The atmosphere and environments are incredible and blows me away that this is a 1998 game. They did an amazing job in the gameplay/graphics section.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]Okay, well the story is pretty vague if i’m gonna be honest. I had many people recommend this game to me and told me that the story was a masterpiece, I must have been playing the wrong game. You don’t really get a mention of the antagonist. You just see him walk behind a wall or go through a portal. Not much screen time for the antonigist. All I knew was that you have to escape the lap and you end up facing the boss in the Xen (other world). The first half of the game was pretty good and I deeply enjoyed it. Once I got into that second half, my whole mood just switched. I did not like the second half, like at all. It was really repetitive and just boring. The other world was okay but didn’t bring my excitement back. It didn’t help that the last boss reminded me of the marshmallow dude from Ghostbusters. The story was a huge let down and maybe because I had high expectations (because everyone that told me about it hyped it up into oblivion).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]Half-Life has a great game length for the size. I beaten this game in like 13 hours, you may beat it faster because some sections were pretty tricky to pass. The replayability is not there in my opinion.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is not good. I get that it’s a game from 1998, but you can barely hear the voice actors in this game. If you have a lot of commotion in the background and they start talking, good luck on hearing them. The audio slider is so minimal as well. They don’t even have a dialogue or voice slider. Besides that the guns sound okay, and it’s what you expect from a game in 1998.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]Only issues I had was that I would get stuck in some environments (clipping issues) and sometimes if I got to a checkpoint, I would be stuck completely having to load an old save to get back to the checkpoint hoping not to get stuck again. It’s an old game so I’ll give it an excuse. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance is great! I mean it’s an old game so we all should run this with no issues. It loads really fast and runs like butter. I had no stutters or freezes or even crashes so this game ages like fine wine in terms of compatibility and performance.[/td]

        [td]🏆Rating[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Half-Life is a hard game to piece together for me. I really loved the first half of the game. I saw the potential it had. I feel when the second half came up, It became too repetitive and boring. I love what they did with the game. The environments are amazing and enemies (besides the final boss) are really fun to fight against. I just didn’t feel a “story” here even though I hear people say it has one of the best stories. Yeah I was disappointed, but it’s still a good game for the time.[/td]

[b] Actual Review (No Spoilers): [/b] It's impossible to summarize this game in any way that it deserves. Half-Life was, and still is an amazing masterpiece. Almost every little detail of this game just works. The gameplay is satisfying, the story is seamless, and the immersion and worldbuilding are excellent. HL1 is one of those games that just continue to stand the test of time even all these years later.

HL1 is pretty much the complete package. You have a creative selection of weapons, used against unique enemies, all the while being rewarded for exploration as you scavenge for supplies and push forward through an interesting, environment-driven storyline. The (at the time) unparalleled level of immersion really helps you sink into the role of Gordon, and it still holds up if not exceeds the immersion in most games today.

Now unfortunately as steam and the goldsrc engine continually get updates, HL1 has slowly gotten a tad buggy. Most of the time it's small things like a lighting error here, some z-fighting textures there. But some things such as the sound engine sometimes breaks as well. The 25th anniversary update brought some patches, but there are also a whole host of mods and alternate versions of the game that help stabilize it. Would highly recommend looking into some bug fix mods if you're going to play HL1 for the first time.

That's really all I can say at this point. Half-Life has already been praised to death and rightfully so. If there is one shooter that all gamers need to play, It's without a doubt Half-Life. 9.5/10",1700788855,1706666400,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You might need to refer to a walkthrough a few times and savescum a lot on your first playthrough, but as you play through it more and memorise the levels and develop new strategies it becomes extremely satisfying to just run through the game and first-try sections you were stuck on before. The level pacing is great and really starts to flow together once you get better.
Obviously there is Xen, which isn't necessarily ""bad"", just very boring and clearly rushed, but at least it's not that long so I can forgive it [spoiler] looking at you Black Mesa [/spoiler] . The Gorarch fight is still horrible though.

Black Mesa is hands down one of the most memorable locations in FPS history. There is rarely a dull and character-lacking moment during its lengthy section of the game.
The weapon loadout is both chock full of great feeling guns and absolute oddities that are fun to toy with on repeat playthroughs.
The enemy variety isn't one of the biggest ever but the variety of gameplay possibilities they offer is so vast that the game feels like it never runs out of things to do with them.
On top of all that the recent Anniversary Update added a bunch of QOL improvements that make the game run and look far better on modern hardware while including some bonus goodies for long-time fans.

The art style ensures that its graphics, despite being dated, are still generally pleasurable to behold and interact with. The game especially benefits from a good “impact” system where the damage you inflict on your enemies and environment, and which is inflicted on you, gives such a great response that it feels fun hitting things. Destroying things. Opening things. So on. 
(The relatively low record I have in this game on Steam is simply because I have mostly played it using an actual CD from 1998 and only recently started playing it via Steam) 

It speaks volumes that the game essentially still looks so good and feels so good after all these years – and that it still has a thriving modding community that shares the love for the game that it deserves. 

It is by no means perfect and some weapons feel much more fun to use than others. Some of the levels rank among my favourite levels of any game I have played, while other levels are boring or can, for other reasons, be found lacking. 

Overall, I know that the modern audience may not fall in love with this game the same way I have. Some will find it too outdated in terms of both graphics and gameplay. However, I do believe that it holds up so incredibly well that I can recommend it to a younger audience, who should be able to use the 2-hour Steam window to give the game a proper chance and not risk losing a few euros on a game they won’t enjoy.

From its innovative storytelling to groundbreaking gameplay mechanics, this first-person shooter remains a benchmark for excellence in the medium.

One of the standout features of Half-Life is its narrative delivery. Unlike many games of its time, Half-Life seamlessly integrates its gripping storyline into the gameplay without resorting to cutscenes. Players assume the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist caught in a catastrophic experiment gone wrong at the Black Mesa Research Facility. The lack of traditional cutscenes allows for an immersive experience, as the narrative unfolds in real-time, creating a sense of urgency and connection with the protagonist.

The game's setting and atmosphere are expertly crafted, contributing to an unforgettable gaming experience. The desolate corridors of Black Mesa, coupled with the mysterious extraterrestrial threats, create a palpable sense of tension and suspense. Half-Life's world-building is second to none, with attention to detail that elevates the overall immersion. The use of scripted events and environmental storytelling adds layers of depth to the narrative, making it a truly engaging journey from start to finish.

Half-Life also revolutionized the first-person shooter genre with its innovative approach to gameplay. The introduction of the HEV Suit not only provided Gordon Freeman with protective gear but also served as an ingenious means of delivering power-ups. The game's puzzles and combat scenarios are meticulously designed, encouraging players to think strategically and adapt to diverse challenges. The inclusion of physics-based puzzles was groundbreaking at the time and showcased Valve's commitment to pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment.

The AI of the enemies and allies in Half-Life further enhanced the gameplay experience. The Xen creatures and the military personnel, demonstrated advanced behaviors, creating dynamic and unpredictable encounters. This level of sophistication in AI was unprecedented in the late '90s and added an extra layer of realism to the gaming world.

Graphically, Half-Life was ahead of its time, boasting impressive visuals that contributed to the overall immersion. The game's design choices, from the iconic Hazardous Environment Suit to the alien landscapes of Xen, remain memorable to this day. The audio design is equally commendable, with a haunting soundtrack and atmospheric sound effects that heighten the sense of tension and excitement.

In conclusion, Half-Life is a pioneering masterpiece that not only redefined the first-person shooter genre but also set new standards for storytelling and immersion in video games. Its impact is still felt in the industry, and the game continues to be celebrated by players and developers alike.",1706471118,1706471118,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Half-Life 1 to pierwsza odsłona serii, w której wcielamy się w postać Gordona Freemana, naukowca pracującego w tajemniczym laboratorium Black Mesa. Wszystko zaczyna się od nieudanego eksperymentu, który otwiera portal do innego wymiaru i wywołuje inwazję obcych stworzeń.

Fabuła jest niesamowicie wciągająca i pełna tajemnic. Musimy przemierzać różne lokacje, walczyć z przeciwnikami i rozwiązywać zagadki, aby przetrwać i odkryć, co tak naprawdę się stało. Historia jest świetnie skonstruowana i utrzymuje nas w napięciu przez całą grę.

Grafika w Half-Life 1 była rewolucyjna jak na swoje czasy. Chociaż teraz może wydawać się trochę przestarzała, to wciąż ma swój urok. Świat gry jest pełen szczegółów i atmosfery, a efekty specjalne są imponujące.

Rozgrywka jest mega satysfakcjonująca. Musimy radzić sobie z różnymi przeciwnikami, korzystać z różnych broni i wykorzystywać otoczenie do naszej korzyści. Gra oferuje również różne sekcje, takie jak jazda platformą czy walka z bossem, które dodają jeszcze więcej urozmaicenia.

Half-Life 1 to kultowa gra, która zasługuje na swoje miejsce w historii gier komputerowych. Jeśli jesteś fanem FPS-ów i chcesz poznać korzenie tej serii, to koniecznie musisz zagrać w Half-Life 1. Będziesz miał niesamowitą przygodę!",1706382371,1706382371,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While its graphics and parts of its gameplay are indeed dated, Half-Life still excels in its setting, atmosphere, and story, all of which come together to create a game that might not be the best in one specific category, but ends up creating something that deserves its status as one of the best games ever made.

The main draw of Half-Life is the setting of Black Mesa itself, with varied environments from offices to labs to industrial processing areas. It helps add to the various set pieces of Half-Life, so that when one gets tired of a theme or environment, it's usually not long before things change and the game rejuvenates one's interest again.

The combat and AI are also incredibly well done for their time. While enemy behavior does seem simple nowadays, that doesn't make the gunplay not fun, especially with the various weapons one gets access to throughout the game. The variety of weapons combined with the different enemy types that necessitate varied tactics also keeps the game fresh. The controls and movement can feel slippery at times compared to more modern games or even Half-Life's sequels, but these are only minor nitpicks that one can quickly get used to.

In the end, there's not much to say against Half-Life, other than how its mechanics have been used and improved upon by so many other future games that it seems dated. Even then, various mods like MMod can modernize the game and make it fun to replay. For those looking for a classic experience, the 25th anniversary update also makes it a perfect time to play the game, now that it has some of its features updated and modernized, like fixes to widescreen, rescaled HUD elements, and new content like the Half-Life: Uplink demo. Half-Life is the game that started it all for Valve, and now is as good a time as any to experience what this classic has to offer.",1608270342,1706262805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is an amazing fps, not only for its smooth mechanics, but its excellent story. Government cover-ups and alien takeovers, this story has it all. Even the smaller details having a PhD in physics makes you really want to play if you are a student. 

All jokes aside, every gamer has to play this game at least once. Level design is mostly fun (DO NOT ASK ABOUT XEN). Weapons all play unique roles during encounters. The level layouts and puzzle also force you to pay attention to the objective.

I played this 25 years after it came out, and this game still holds up to modern standards, aside from the graphics department obviously. No matter the age, this game is just amazing. Enemy design is super cool as the aliens look like they evolved somehow. The G-Man is the G-Man, we know nothing about him, and we must prepare for unforeseen consequences.

On first playthrough HL2 definitely outshines is, but I prefer the pacing of HL1. Of course though.. there's the subject of Xen. Fuck Xen. Xen is an awful piece of garbage with the only fun part being the Gonarch and the start of Interloper due to the optional stealth path being really cool and intriguing.

Half Life is one of the most revolutionary and fun shooters that I have played in a good while, and while it's graphics are dated, I still recommend it over Black Mesa because of the map layouts feeling better with more comfortable enemy AI. This game is so good in fact, that a twitch series parodying this game blew up and now my profile pic is from that series. While that series uses Half Life: Source, I do not recommend that version since HL: Source was clearly rushed with many bugs and glitches. Overall, it takes a while to get used to this game, but when you do, it feels like an adrenaline rush of an adventure. Now before I go, I do want to mention the combat in this game. The combat in Half Life feels great, but not everybody will like it. The combat in Half Life uses strategy- wait, wait stop, stop walking away.
When I say strategic, I mean that the combat has you revisiting encounters to see what works and what doesn't, and while it sounds boring, it's what makes the game shine. The combat in Half Life is better than any other fps I've played with it's over powered, but low ammo weapons like the ""Tas Cannon"" and ""Gluon Gun"", to the more simple weapons, like a machine gun that also fires grenades, or an alien that you shove your hand into, which makes you able to shoot smaller aliens that are like little homing missiles. This game is crazy, and while people poop on the ending area, Xen, I got past it pretty quick, and while it was boring at times in Xen, the rest of the game was one of the best fps games I have ever played.
I absolutely recommend this game, and it's only $10, but wait for the summer sale, so you can get the half life complete bundle for about $17 or less.

One of the most iconic franchises of all time. So iconic, in fact, that a fucking crowbar, immediately makes people think of one face. Gordon Freeman
A game that has influenced the entire FPS genre as a whole. Honestly the first to bring narrative experiences to shooters. And having more strategic gameplay. The story is told in such a unique way, that you honestly don't see too often in games anymore. Through a little something called “Environmental Storytelling”
This quality of storytelling and worldbuilding starts as early as the game's tutorial. In my personal opinion, I feel like you can tell a LOT about a game looking at just its tutorial level. I love it when games explain mechanics via world building. It really sells the universe that much more. (Leagues better than a menu pop-up if you ask me) The tutorial is where I realized how special this game's immersion was (and still is to this day) friendly NPCs do not take very kindly to being provoked, as ones with guns will shoot at you if attacked.
 The biggest thing that blew me away in the original Half-Life (and all other future VALVe titles for that matter) The entire game is chock-full of interteractable objects, NPC reactions, that make this world feel so much more believable 25 YEARS after initial release. Usually, if I asked a question, the answer was yes! 
Environments that are THIS interactable aren’t as standard or common as you might think nowadays. Half-life was made during the era of video games being made up of 5 triangles, so to sell immersion, developers had to focus more on world interactivity and logic. The beginning section ALONE was just fun to walk around and explore. 
Another thing that helps with immersion is that through the entire game, you are always in control. No matter what. If there is dialogue or a set piece, it never rips control away from you like many games tend to do. In Half-Life, the story is told IN the world, and NOT in your face through boring cutscenes. Truth be told, there is only ONE “cinematic” in the entire game that rips control away from you. (When you get jumped and stripped of all of your weapons)
In a world where games nowadays are becoming more and more like interactable movies, this was an immense sense of fresh air. Half-Life makes you feel like a real person in this world. Not just a story vessel for fanfiction writers to show off their fetishes. Y’know it's pretty funny giving praises to a game that only have like what, 5 friendly NPC models to tell it? 
Somehow it just all WORKS. Having story delivered to you via only dialogue through the characters that you find, (Or the facilities announcement system) further just adds to the immersion factor.  Also the fact that Gordon does not say a SINGLE word throughout the entire franchise is so nice. Gordon being a silent protagonist makes every thought the player has, and every reaction so personal to you. Finally, I just HAVE to mention the G-Man. Look, I (nor anyone else for that matter) know too much about him, because you really only talk to him once in this entire game. (Guess you will have to play the rest of the series to find out!)
	But this beautiful storytelling and world building means absolutely nothing if the gameplay sucks. (theoretically) because in actuality, the gameplay of the original Half-Life fucking RULES. Half-Life (at the time) was at the cutting-edge of FPS gunplay. It’s so good, in fact, that 25 years after its initial release, it is still an absolute BLAST to play. The guns are all unique, punchy, and sound AMAZING to use.
Almost every weapon also has an alternate function (by pressing right click instead of left) which is pretty cool! The SMG, for example, launches an impact grenade, which is a 1 hit kill for a variety of enemies. For the Shotgun, it fires two shells instead of one.  (but it has a longer pump time) The Tau Cannon, it can charge for a more devastating blast. 
Many different alien races have come through the portal that know nothing about earth. Luckily for them, Gordon Freeman (and by extension the player) is an EXPERT when it comes to teaching them our ways (of violence). I like to think that Miyazaki (The creator of Dark Souls) was a HUGE Half-Life fan. I say this because there are so many bullshit surprise enemy attacks, (or just enemies appearing behind you for no apparent reason) so just watch out for that. 
Not saying that this is a negative, because in most situations I find it quite funny. I will say though that I played this on Hard difficulty. Half-Life does not take “Hard” lightly. I think I played a vast majority of the game below 10HP. Half-Life even has a follow system for the NPC’s, so you can have them follow you and “help” with combat, give you health if they are a scientist (welcome in my book considering I was almost always on the brink of death) or other very helpful things (like disarming trip mines) 
The overall sandbox of the game is also rolled out to you at a very nice pace. And tends to work really well with the flow of the story (Like how the crossbow, the only weapon that can shoot underwater, is introduced at the same time the gigantic man eating fish is) By far one of, if not my most favorite aspect of the original Half-Life (and the rest of the series for that matter) is the level design (in most cases anyway) 
Every single environment just feels so real and believable. The entire experience to me never felt like just a video game level. What I mean by this is that some games use very obvious signs or markings telling you where to go. Half-Life has nearly none of that. There is essentially zero hand-holding in this game. And like I mentioned earlier, Gordon will not say a SINGLE WORD during the length of his screen time. 
After playing, I can now truly understand why Half-Life is in the top 10 video games for most people (where it has taken a spot in my personal list as well) I'm blown away that this game holds up so well to this day, and that the gaming industry hasn’t changed all that much. In terms of mechanics anyway. Sure, games have gotten prettier, But in some areas I am willing to argue that it has in fact regressed in that field. 
Half-Life is still more mechanically sound than most games today. VALVe has always known how to make a timeless videogame (as their track record proves) Critic review scores on Half-Life should let you know that these guys have always been KING since 1998 (well almost always, in the case Artifact anyway) If you like video games, even slightly, you NEED to play Half-Life. And if the old graphics bug you that much, then just go play Black Mesa, the officially licensed 2015 remake of Half-Life. You have no excuses. 
Now go do yourself a favor and become enlightened. Or don’t. But then you would be missing out on quite a lot. I give Half-Life a solid 4.5 stars. Falls short in some spots but overall is one of the best and most tailored videogame experiences to date, even 25 years after release.

Well after i saw a video that showed how you were suppose to turn on the engine i was simply put: mad. In my opinion the game doesnt show pretty well that you were suppose to turn the engine on both sides. Black mesa did it much better presenting it but thats besides the point. 

I finished the game and now re-playing it alongside with Black mesa. My first playthrough of Half Life was on hard. It was REALLY HARD. It was borderline impossible for me at the end levels because i didint have any ammo or health. But at the end i did finish the game and i can proudly say i finished the game on hard. Now when i am playing Half Life on normal it feels easier. A lot easier, too easy. I cant even imagen how easy mode must be. Comparing both difficulties normal feels really easy but hard feels way more difficult then it should be. Yes the damage you take makes it more tactical. You can take two hits from an HEV grunt and half of your health is gone. Also the amount of bullets an enemy needs to swallow is shitty. 
In short: Normal too easy, hard to hard. I dont know how to explain it soo this will have to do.

Besides the difficulty being a bit wank it world and gameplay is super nice. While it is made in 1998 it still holds up pretty okay-ish. I wish i could put more thought into this review but i am simply to tired and lazy.

Hra Half-Life byla původně vydána v roce 1998 společností Valve Corporation a od té doby získala obrovskou popularitu mezi hráči po celém světě. Kromě toho, že si získala srdce hráčů svou inovativní a příběhově bohatou hratelností, také ovlivnila způsob, jakým by se měly vytvářet herní příběhy a jak by měla vypadat moderní akční hra.

Jedním z nejvýznamnějších prvků Half-Life je jeho poutavý a napínavý příběh. Hráč přebírá roli Gordona Freemana, fyzika v Black Mesa Research Facility, která utrpí katastrofu, s níž se musí postavit tváří v tvář invazi mimozemských bytostí. Příběh je vyprávěn prostřednictvím očima hráče a je neuvěřitelně realistický a dojemný, což přidává na jeho síle a hráči se s ním rychle sžijí.

Grafika v Half-Life je na tehdejší dobu poměrně pokroková a stále drží poměrně dobře i dnes. Oceňuje se především kvalita textur a efektů, které jsou vysoké a zaručují realističnost herního světa. Na druhou stranu by mohla být dnes považována za zastaralou ve srovnání s moderními hrami, ale to nevadí, protože Half-Life byla vydána před více než dvaceti lety a grafika nebyla tehdy hlavním zaměřením.

Hratelnost Half-Life je také výjimečná. Hráč má možnost používat širokou škálu zbraní a vybavení a soupeřit s nepřátelskými silami, které jsou velmi inteligentní a náročné na zabití. Level design je propracovaný a nabízí různé strategické přístupy k překonání překážek. Přidává to do hry ještě větší rozměr a zvyšuje zájem hráče.

Celkově vzato je Half-Life jednou z nejlepších her v historii, ať už se zaměříme na její revoluční příběh, grafiku nebo hratelnost. Je to hra, kterou by si neměl nechat ujít žádný opravdový fanoušek videoher a která bude stále považována za průlomové dílo ve svém žánru.",1705826986,1705826986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ok calm side over. FUCK THIS GAME. WHY. WHY. WHY. AM I ON ICE SKATES. The movement is so dated it almost made it unplayable. The level design is not suited for the ridiculous nature of the movement. Not to mention the motion sick inducing screen tilt that's paired with it. The gun play is fine. There is a large variety of guns in the game which is very nice, but only like 3 of them are useful when it comes to actually killing stuff. Want to kill that guy? Better use the revolver, crossbow(revolver but with bullet drop and the slowest fucking reload you've ever experienced in a game), AR, or the tau gun. Every other weapon is a tedious shoot fest until you run out of ammo, and by the time you do, you probably didn't kill anything. Don't.... Don't even get me started on the level design. Let me highlight to you what happens in the majority of the missions. You get health from a health or hev station. THE SECOND you turn the corner, expect 15 enemies that will get rid of all of that health and armor. And this without fail happens, every, single, level. By the time you reach your 5th or 6th health station you think to yourself, ""oh they're preparing me for a gun fight"". ALSO, expect in every mission horrible parkour that obviously was designed prior to creating the movement for the game, causing you to die to fall damage.

SPOILERS FOR LAST BOSS
Whoever designed the stage for the final boss needs psychiatric help. Why is the main gimmick behind the arena a fucking jump pad, when the in air movement is horrible. The boss will teleport you to various rooms and there is one that's sort of shaped like an upside down cone. Fuck that room, this game was not designed for parkour, yet the final 3rd of the game is so reliant on it.",1705766533,1705766533,False,1,0,0.434782624244689941,0,True,False,False

70,156371292,76561199371923266,0,3,880,0,880,1705742727,"Overall, I think I rate it a high 6/10. 

The gun-play is super fun. I can imagine gamers in the 90s spent hundreds of hours in this playing multiplayer. The puzzles are interesting and the difficulty level is just right for the most part, but you can excuse the game designers for making the bits where you fight a tank harder than usual. Plus, the ability to save at literally any time renders any complaints about the autosave null and void. Do not be afraid to save constantly when things get difficult. The movement, especially at the beginning, can feel like the entire game is an ice-level, but you kind-of get used to it by the end. It helps you feel more badass as you glide around the level shooting soldiers and aliens. You will fall off some ledges though.

My biggest issues with this is its...presentation. The graphics are an unavoidable result of its time and it does take away from the experience a bit. The story wasn't anything particularly mind-blowing. It just doesn't meet the expectations I had from half-life fans being obsessed with getting a third game. I'm guessing that's because Half-life 2 is the masterpiece and this is a flawed but still fun lead up to that. Most of the time I could barely hear what the NPCs were saying. Some high ranking enemies felt way too strong for how easily you lose your health and they don't really react to being shot until their dead. 

The design of the aliens was really cool and The soundtrack is awesome (if you put mp3 volume at max). The weapons  were pleasantly varied, though some I barely used at all (trip mines). FYI, the tutorial is a separate level that you access from the main menu. Play through it. You'll learn how to crouch jump and long jump, things that are essential for finishing this game.

70,156205535,76561198042763579,0,2,1905,117,1601,1708827760,"I avoided Half-Life for a long time.  I knew about it and I knew how beloved it was, but it didn't seem like something I'd enjoy.  For a very long time, my only real exposure to the series was (of all things) the ridiculous video series ""Half-Life Full Life Consequences"", and while I loved the Portal games Half-Life seemed to be a completely different beast.  More serious, more violent.  It looked on the surface like something for ""hardcore"" gamers.  It wasn't until I watched HLVRAI (An improv comedy series taking place in a Garry's Mod VR version of the game) and saw people actually move through the HL world that I started to be intrigued by the game itself and its odd lore, and decided to finally give it a shot.  I've played it through twice now, once on PS2 and once here on Steam.  While I loved the game both times the Steam version was by far the better experience (although I missed the option to replay as a Vortigaunt in this one).  I'm sure I'll be revisiting it in the future.

The biggest thing I realized when I finally got around to playing is that Half-Life is just as weird as Portal; it just doesn't have a wise-cracking malevolent AI to rub that fact in your face.  Black Mesa is just as messed up as Aperture Science, and Gordon Freeman isn't exactly a heroic protagonist.  Depending on how you play, he can range from ""guy who comes in late to work, helps to conduct a dangerous experiment despite the risks, and has to deal with the consequences,"" to ""silent agent of chaos"", to ""remorseless serial murderer.""  Everything, including Gordon, has this persistent feeling of being more than a little bit ""off"" that I found incredibly compelling.

I also somehow missed all these years that what makes Half-Life so beloved is that it's NOT your average hardcore FPS.  The gameplay acts as a conduit for the world and story, not the other way around.  The entire first two chapters are dedicated purely to worldbuilding, with zero combat until Chapter 3.  Most of the enemy encounters are set up to be very puzzle-like, with ways to optimize them using the environment and the tools at your disposal, rather than having to rely on quick shooting (though having a keyboard and mouse to shoot quickly and accurately when needed sure helped!).  I spent much of my playtime purposely redoing sections over and over to try and figure out the best paths forward.   I ended up taking a lot of intentional deaths just to learn the layout and experiment with different ways of navigating it, which is something this game shares with one of my favorite series: Metroid.  Gordon is a scientist, not a soldier, and the gameplay reflects that.

It's also surprisingly varied chapter-by-chapter.  Each chapter adds something new, and different players will respond differently to each of the ""gimmicks"", with different players having unique chapters they find especially fun or challenging.  It's a remarkably clever game, and I found myself frequently smiling at the novelty of different sections.  It doesn't necessarily do everything well, but it tries many things that would be too risky for more conservative developers to even consider, and that keeps it feeling fresh throughout.

That being said, the game does have its downsides.  Even with all of the updates in the 25th anniversary edition I still found myself encountering a lot of visual glitches, a few of which forced me to have to restart from my last save.  The game also notoriously ends on a sour note, and I have to agree with the people who say the Xen sections of the game are the weakest.  There are aspects I love about them, particularly with regards to the lore implications for the aliens, but they involve a lot of clunky platforming and a new enemy type that is a pain in the butt to fight on awkward terrain.  It also has one of the most bafflingly terrible final bosses in anything I've ever played, which is a shame.

Overall, I'm really fond of this game despite its shortcomings, and there's a lot more I could say.  It's a major piece of gaming history that deserves to be experienced, and this is a great time to play it!  The Half-Life bundle is also a hell of a deal, particularly if you get it on sale like I did.",1705542096,1705542096,True,1,0,0.505813956260681152,0,True,False,False

70,156194518,76561198873446668,0,3,1320,0,1319,1705589192,"Having recently beaten Half-Life on my Steam Deck (which it has been optimized for, including an updated control scheme with proper analog movement!), I wanted to share my thoughts on it.  I'd only played the PS2 version many years ago, so this was a quite a drastic upgrade over my prior experience with the game, and I can say I now fully understand it's reputation as one of the greatest games of all time.

The game is dated visually, but still able to convey a strong sense of atmosphere and isolation, along with good environmental variety.  The music is sparse, but all the more memorable for it, and it adds considerably to the game's already strong atmosphere.  Compared to Half-Life 2 and other modern games, the story is sparse and simple, but it's told in an effective and interesting way.  You are always in control of protagonist Gordon Freeman, and the story never leaves his perspective for cutscenes or anything else.  It was incredibly novel and innovative in 1998, and remains effective today.

The gameplay is where Half-Life truly shines.  The shooting is solid and fun, with a good variety of weapons and enemies, and surprisingly great enemy AI that makes most encounters fairly challenging, and always keeps you on your toes.  Enemies will try to flank you, toss grenades to flush you out of cover, retreat to their comrades when injured, and so on.  The game's true strength is in it's pacing and level design, however.

The game is always throwing new things at you, and every level introduces some new feature or gimmick.  There are numerous environmental puzzles, platforming, highly interactive enviroments where if you think you can do something, you often can, and even some extremely difficult combat encounters that practically require approaching them in a creative way or using the environment to your advantage (or even occasionally just plain old running away!).  It's brilliant stuff, and all paced perfectly.  There are some end game levels that have received criticism in the years since the game's release for being a bit different from the rest of the game, but personally I enjoyed them as a change of pace, and really liked the finale a lot, overall.

The game isn't perfect, of course.  The level of challenge is surprisingly high, and while that is by no means a bad thing, it can occasionally start to feel like trial and error.  There were certain encounters and obstacles that felt like you were practically meant to die to them the first time you play, and it felt as though the game was almost kind of encouraging quicksaving/loading (AKA save scumming) at times, which is kind of questionable and hurts the immersion the game otherwise strives for and largely achieves with flying colors.  I would also definitely recommend that if you're going to play with a controller (or the Steam Deck itself), as I did, that you use one with gyro functionality as well (say, a Dualsense or Switch Pro controller, or the Deck itself with it's built in gyro), as the game was really designed for a level of precision aiming that analog sticks just can't replicate on their own.  Also, platforming is sometimes a bit fiddly and awkward due to the fast movement of the game, although it generally works well for the most part, and is improved with the newly added analog movement.

In summary, Half-Life is a near perfect video game that achieves pretty much everything it set out to do.  It's an immersive, atmospheric FPS with fun and very challenging combat, a decent (and compellingly and uniquely told) story, and some of the best level design and pacing of any game ever.  It was also a truly groundbreaking title for it's time that largely holds up brilliantly today, and that everyone who loves video games owes to themselves to experience at least once.

Now after the start of the year in 2024 i suddenly got a urge to play it til the end, and i am so happy I did.

The gameplay holds up really well in this game and the AI of the enemies is really impressive for it's time, the ai is still more intelligent than some games coming out today.

I will admit it hasn't aged perfectly (feels quite janky at times) but that's expected given its age. The difficulty on normal was also on point, it was hard but not too hard and the quick save feature definitely makes the game more accessible despite its difficulty. I am really looking forward to playing the spin-offs (Blue Shift and Opposing Force) and am even more excited to play Black Mesa with my beast rig. The ending was really good. The Half-Life universe is definitely filled with mystery and intrigue and I look forward to getting more answers provided that the sequels/spin-offs provide them or can live up to the quality of this first game. If you think you might want to experience Half-Life I would highly recommend it. Its worth checking out due to the great story, atmosphere and good level design.

Its a classic, og, janky but fun game.
when you play, it feels like you're back in 1998. the level design and voice lines still surprise me in this day and age.
there are a decent amount of secrets and full playtime is nice. 

The maps change when the story progresses but the gameplay is basically still the same, this can make it somewhat boring.

none the less very fun, but might not be worth the 10 dollars, wait until it is for sale, trust me.

However, some of the other stuff is obtuse enough I had to use a walkthrough at a few points. For examples: the water surface texture in some areas is entirely opaque, so I didn't realize where I could surface and kept drowning. There's not that much story, but what is there is communicated well with Valve's trademark storytelling style that prioritizes player control even during story segments. The graphics are awful, though. Looking forward to trying out Black Mesa and HL2 in that respect.

Overall, I recommend it, because it is a good deal of fun and a steal at $0.99. But if you've got the funds... maybe skip this and go for Black Mesa.

As a side note, I played through the entire game with a controller and no aim assist. Gyro aiming made this totally doable and fun. It's absolutely wild that I'm playing a 26 year old computer game with a Nintendo controller, making use of gyro aim and analog movement. Though I will say, the analog movement doesn't do certain platforming challenges any favors, as they were designed with WASD in mind.

Rating: ★★★★★

If there's one game that stands as a testament to the evolution of the gaming industry, it's Half-Life 1. Released in 1998, this classic first-person shooter not only redefined the genre but laid the foundation for the immersive, narrative-driven experiences we enjoy today.

From the moment you step into the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist caught in a disastrous experiment gone wrong, you're plunged into a gripping tale of survival. Half-Life 1 excels in storytelling without relying on cutscenes, seamlessly integrating narrative elements into the gameplay, immersing you in the mysterious and hostile world of the Black Mesa Research Facility.

The level design in Half-Life 1 is nothing short of genius. Each area is meticulously crafted to provide a perfect balance of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving. The game introduces innovative mechanics and environmental puzzles that were groundbreaking for its time, creating a dynamic and engaging experience that keeps you on your toes.

One of Half-Life 1's standout features is the AI, which was revolutionary at the time. The enemies exhibit realistic behaviors, adapting to your tactics and making each encounter unique and challenging. The inclusion of scripted sequences and memorable set pieces adds a cinematic quality that was ahead of its time, leaving an indelible mark on the gaming landscape.

The atmosphere and soundtrack contribute significantly to the overall experience. The haunting ambient music enhances the tension, while the environmental sounds immerse you in the eerie silence of the Black Mesa facility. Combined, these elements create an atmosphere that is both captivating and spine-chilling, adding an extra layer of depth to the game.

Even after more than two decades, Half-Life 1's impact is still felt in modern gaming. The modding community has kept the game alive, with countless fan-made creations that showcase the enduring appeal of this masterpiece.

In summary, Half-Life 1 is not just a game; it's a piece of gaming history that has stood the test of time. Whether you're a veteran gamer nostalgic for the classics or a newcomer eager to explore the roots of the FPS genre, Half-Life 1 is an essential experience that deserves its status as a timeless masterpiece. Prepare for an unforgettable journey through the corridors of Black Mesa and witness the birth of a gaming legend.",1705212642,1705212642,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

70,155917380,76561198178854123,69,77,576,0,576,1704994877,"Ah, the magnum opus that is Half-Life, an undeniably magnificent jewel within the grand tapestry of electronic diversions, a veritable siren's call to the intrepid gamer's soul. Picture, if you will, the heart-pounding fervor as one thrusts headlong into the verdant heart of the African jungle, where gargantuan arthropods, seemingly spawned from the wildest recesses of imagination, await with bated breath.

Now, let's delve into the weapon of choice—the crowbar, a colossus among melee instruments, a gargantuan implement that stretches the very limits of practicality with its exact width meticulously measured at a jaw-dropping 10 centimeters. This is not a mere tool; it's a symphony of destruction, an overture of chaos, a roaring crescendo of gameplay prowess that defies all preconceived notions of virtual armaments. To wield such a formidable and precise instrument in a game ostensibly intended for a younger audience is nothing short of audacious, a testament to the game's unapologetic embrace of the extraordinary.

As we navigate this eccentric virtual realm, our protagonist, a scholarly avatar adorned in the regalia of a theoretical physics laureate, stands before the colossal insects, armed with the aforementioned 10-centimeter-wide crowbar. The vivid imagery evokes a sense of sheer audacity—a juxtaposition so extraordinary that it catapults the gaming experience into realms of unparalleled eccentricity.

Now, consider the force needed to dispatch these titanic arthropods with the crowbar. Let's introduce a variable—let's call it 'F' for force. The sheer kinetic energy required to annihilate such colossal foes can be expressed mathematically as F = m * a, where 'm' represents mass and 'a' represents acceleration. The force exerted, a virtual Herculean strength, is an astounding numerical value that pushes the boundaries of what one might consider plausible in the realm of digital physics.

And in the midst of this digital odyssey, let us not forget the scientific meaning of ""half-life."" In the realm of nuclear physics, it denotes the time required for a quantity to reduce by half through decay—a concept that echoes the ephemerality of our virtual exploits and the fleeting nature of the challenges faced within the extraordinary world of Half-Life.

Yet, the saga deepens with a nuance that beguiles the very fabric of reason. Our erudite protagonist, bearing the lofty mantle of a theoretical physics degree, undertakes a perilous odyssey in pursuit of enigmatic crystals. Imagine, if you will, the sheer audacity of a scholar, normally ensconced in the rarefied air of intellectual pursuits, now thrust into the tumultuous maelstrom of crystal retrieval—an endeavor that defies the very tenets of scholarly disposition.

In this convolution of virtual narratives, we witness our academic luminary forsaking the hallowed halls of contemplative musings for the frontline trenches of crystal retrieval—a narrative detour so peculiar that it surpasses the boundaries of imagination. The querulous pondering remains: Should not this learned individual, steeped in the arcane arts of theoretical physics, be more aptly suited for contemplative inquiry than venturing into the tempest of experimental perils?

Ah, my esteemed conversationalist, the chronicles of virtual storytelling transcend the mundane, leaving us to traverse surreal landscapes with nought but a furrowed brow and a sense of bewildered enchantment. Such is the captivating enigma that is Half-Life, where exaggeration meets the extraordinary, and the force required to dispatch monstrous foes adds a thrilling layer of numerical intricacy to this audacious brilliance.",1705180605,1705180605,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can see how it affected many games to come, but the speedy quick movement just did not feel right. Especially when you mix it with the platforming. Obviously the graphics are old and do not really get in the way aside from understanding damage numbers, but also tracking missiles and such. But overall the game can be easily and simply played through by saving after every encounter which is how I played it. If you wanted to play through with the auto save system, you are a better man than I. For 99 cents this was pretty fun and I would recommend it, but the game play starts to get boring after a while. The inconsistent way to get ammo mixed with weird timing of health packs made some missions just a breeze and others you had to properly conserve ammo. I only went to a walk-through guide twice and found the answer to be obvious, I was just impatient. This game is a pretty straightforward experience and I am glad I have finally done the pilgrimage to the game that inspired many. Oh also, the game reminded me of Far Cry 1 in many many ways, like an incredible amount of ways.

Most games just revolve around you shooting the enemy, but Half-life makes you think. All combat encounters make you utilise your kit in their respective areas, while you have to use the environment around you. The lack of hand-holding is also a breath of fresh air, as it allows you to do what you want to do. Exploring is also as fun as the combat, finding resources and feeling rewarded for going down that hallway. The graphics may not be up to standard, but thats what Black Mesa is for.

It features a lot of changes in level design and mechanics; even built in support for mouse and keyboard for those interested. in all honesty, I prefer it to the PC version. That said, the PC version is good too. I love the early levels very much. The pacing and set pieces keep you on you toes at all times. However the game is not without issues.
The real issue with the game is Xen. I never realized how much of an issue it was until I played the PC version. Outside of the infamous chapter's set pieces and bosses, Xen is tiresome. For one, it's too long and drags, especially during interloper. Second, some of the platforming is incredibly dull. However, Xen is not the only issue. 
Introducing: the flying b**tards, aka, the Controllers- I hate these things. The problem is not that their hard to hit, or anything about their unfairness, but rather that they come in packs, usually, five or more. 
Two shots from your revolver or two bolts from your crossbow, takes them down, but it's hard to focus on them when there are two or more vortigaunts rapidly blasting you with moutain dew colored lighting bolts. It makes fighting them more cumbersome than it should be. By no means the worst enemy design, but far from the best Half Life has to offer. A quick aside, fighting controllers is less of an issue in the PS2 version because of the lock-on-aim-assist. Just lock on and shoot, done. 
Office complex is by far my favorite part of the game. I love running through the hallways blasting aliens and scientists indiscriminately. The way it interlocks and weaves you back and forth between set pieces is excellent. You never feel like you're backtracking because there's always something new to offer. 
Overall Half Life is a good game. I recommend the PC version, but if you're willing to invest a little more time and money I really recommend the PS2 version.",1704916383,1704916383,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has more weapons, smarter AI that still impress me to this day, faster movement and more diverse environments.
The long jump module is the best powerup ever put in a game.

While the plot itself is nothing special (in my opinion) the way the story is told through gameplay rather than pre rendered cutscenes or dialogue boxes is simply brilliant as it keeps you immersed at all time rather than making you wonder why the rest of the game dont look as good as the CGI movie the publisher forced in.
Its the textbook example of Show Don't Tell, or in game terms: Play dont Show!
While i also love those games, this game is the direct opposite of the Metal Gear series with a simpler plot that is only told though what you as a player would know at any time.
Sometimes less is more especially if it can be used across language barriers or to not interrupt the fun for speedrunners.

And even if you dont care about the simple plot of Gorgeous Freemont cleaning up the mess he caused, this game constantly rewards you with gameplay thats the perfect mix of adrenaline gorged speed, slow atmospheric horror and cerebral tactics from the muli use weapons and the enemy patterns.

Even with the tanky power armour, Gordon is still a frail glass canon.
While enemies can deal insane damage really fast, due to their predictable patterns it never feels unfair or broken. With every enemy being a CS player having to tediously stand still in order to shoot you, the game uses that to silently encourage you as a player to play it as a fun movement shooter by moving in, dealing damage and using your movement to dodge damage as you move out.
To win you must run, think, shoot and live to repeat the process another day.

Even the most powerfull weapons you get in the late game dont feel braindead as they use scarce ammo (that can sometimes share ammopool with worse weapons) and can just as easially damage and kill its own user really fast if you're not carefull.
I love weapons that can be used as tools or that are super powerfull with serious downsides to really make you think when it is a good time to use them.

Also for me the best part is opening the console and typing in the speak command followed by a textstring of whatever dumb stuff you want the VOX or HCU to say.

""Gordon...Freeman's...ass...is...opened!""

""Dr Coomer...Is...Engaged...with...Calhoun""

Its also a fast game to load steam overlay on for when you must google stuff for essays and not be recommended the most random crap afterwards.

Gordon: Hi, George.

Noory: Yes, sir. Hi.

Gordon: My name is Gordon. I'm a theoretical physicist. I work at a research facility, and something very mystical has been happening to me so far. 
There's this man, I'll describe him. 
He looks the same every day, and he's been stalking me. 
He's a middle-aged man in a blue-tinged suit, and he has very pale skin with dark hair, and he always carries a briefcase. 
And whenever I see him, he always seems to adjust his tie and brush himself off. 
I've never seen him up close. 
And the mystical thing about it is that whenever I see him, he's always in a place I can't access, such as another room blocked off by a window or down the hallway or on the other side of a door or walking across a catwalk. 
When I try to get to his place, I say if I see him down a long hallway and run there, he's gone. 
The most of the The weirdest thing was yesterday. 
I wanted to get access to this room and I wanted to go to the short way, so I tried to open this door. 
He was on the other side.
I saw him through the window, and he locked the door on the other side. 
I had to go the long way around, and he was gone. 
The only way that he could have left was go my way or through the door, but the door was still locked from that side. 
Now, I and a friend of mine who's in security named and Barney, we call him the G-Man, and most of my other colleagues will not even... I think they must know of this man, but they do not mention him. 
I can see it in their eyes when I talk to them about it, that there's some type of fear.

Noory: You think he's like a government worker?

Gordon: I I think that's why we call him the G-Man. He looks like it. He has a suit.

Noory: No personality, right?

Gordon: No personality. Well, he has a very blank face on him. I mean, It seems he always has this tick of adjusting his tie and brushing his coat off.

Noory: Are you working your theoretical physicist? Are you working on anything that you can tell us about that he would want to get information about?

Gordon: Yes, yes.

Noory: You are?

Gordon: We are working on portal technology.

Noory: Now, tell me about that, portal technology?

Gordon: I'm afraid I cannot go-

Noory: Is this the ability to travel through other worlds?

Gordon: Yes. We're in heavy competition with another company, but I can't really get into that right now.

Noory: How close are we to getting this done, you think?

Gordon: I cannot say. I don't know. I just started a few months ago, and basically, my level is basically assisting the senior scientists.

Noory: Well, have you jeopardised yourself by coming on this program today?

Gordon: No, I have not. I haven't said anything important.

Noory: Has this man threatened you or anything like that?

Gordon: He has never spoken to me. I've never heard his voice. I've never seen him up the The closest I've ever seen him was the other side of that door. He's never really been in the same room as me, but he's always seems to be stalking me.

Noory: Top management has got to know he's there.

Gordon: Yes.

Noory: Do you go through heavy security?

Gordon: Yes, very heavy security.

Noory: So he gets in, right?

Gordon: When I started, I thought he was the administrator, but I met Mr. Breen, and he's certainly not him. He looks very different. He talks to me frequently.

Noory: Every day he's there, this guy?

Gordon: Mostly every day. Not every day, but some days I see him more, some days I see him less. But I once was working on something on my desk, and I just got up, and he walked right by my door. I ran outside, and he was gone.

Noory: All right. Well, you keep us up to date on this as much as you can. Portal technology, the ability to travel to other worlds, just like the movie Contact. That's pretty fascinating.",1692035848,1704847618,True,1,1,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

I've always heard of HL and how good a franchise it is and I even had played like half of HL2 but never finished it, but one day, out of the blue, I just decided to launch this game and try to play it. And boy, did I love it. The way this story is structured is so that you are always at the center of the story and you are always playing how you want. I feel when the combat was light and unique (which it often was unique) it was excellent. I loved the use of the different weapons and the tactics on the enemies and how you could fight them in a multitude of different ways and strategies. But occasionally in the too-combat-heavy sections it did tend to drag a bit when you just kept save-scumming and just had to try to brute force your way through that level. But other than that I loved the feel of this game and how it felt so simple yet complex and rich. I loved the subtle build of the G-Man and how you see him following you. I loved the interactions between the characters and how it gave off little bits of lore if you stopped and looked at the levels or listened to the scientists. One of my favorite moments was when you finally go outside, it was such a weirdly good feeling because it seemed like such a mundane thing but in this game after being indoors the whole time, finally going outside in surface tension and seeing the blue sky contrasted between the deep orange cliff edges and the grey metallic laboratories was something else. This game inspired me to play the rest of this series and seriously begin to consider going into game design as a career because seeing the story of early valve making a legendary and revolutionary game like this as their first game with a little team is incredibly inspiring, even after all of the scummy and disheartening practices they've come to do throughout the years.",1669278727,1704828686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

   DOOM and QUAKE had already laid the foundations for what a good shooter of the time had to be, but it would not be until the arrival of a Valve in its infancy that the genre would take its next giant step, specifically with Valve's debut release, Half -Life and the enormous changes that this meant in the market.

   Released on November 8, 1998, Half-Life is a first-person shooter with puzzle elements which takes place in a science fiction universe in the early 2000s, in which we take the role of a highly trained young scientist. who after a serious failed experiment, must face all kinds of abominations until he finds a solution to the chaos.

[b] Below, a list of positive and negative points experienced during my time playing and free of spoilers (do not consider this as an absolute truth, but as what it is, a simple opinion) [/b]

[h3] What did I like? [/h3]

🟩   [b] The story. [/b] It presents a simple story which can be delved into very easily, explaining in detail the reason for everything, along with a large number of unknowns.

🟩   [b] The gameplay. [/b] It is the next big step in action since QUAKE, frenetic in combat, but it also has puzzle sections to think about, everything being well planned.

🟩   [b] The music. [/b] It's 100% personal, but I consider many songs made for this title to be really enjoyable songs even beyond their purpose within the title.

[h3] What did I NOT like? [/h3]
 
⬜   [b] No-uh. [/b] I didn't find anything that really bothered me.


[h3] What should I take into account when playing? [/h3]

❕ [b] Nope, nothing. [/b] There really is nothing relevant to take into account beyond playing.

[h3] Personal opinion. [/h3]

   It represents the next great step in the evolution of shooters, but in addition to that, it is a title ahead of its time, full of life, action and a story that today fills everyone who plays it with intrigue, a gem. For anyone who appreciates the history of this genre.

For those that don't know, Half-Life is revolutionary in quite a few ways.  Building off of the Quake Engine in what became called the GoldSrc engine (retroactively named after the release of the Source Engine), the game is most known, in my opinion, for how the game is experienced.  In other titles, there are cutscenes that exist before you gain control of the character.  Opening Credits might also be a thing, and all in all, you're going to have no control over your character.  In this game, you've got control over the main character, Gordon Freeman, for about 99% of the game, and the entirety of it is viewed through his eyes.  The introduction as you ride the monorail to your destination?  You can move around.  Is there a creature that gets introduced?  You can walk into it head-on.  Is a helicopter flying in but you don't care because you're busy finding cover?  You can do that and look out when it's safe.

Speaking of story, Half-Life pioneered storytelling in the FPS Genre.  Before, things were mainly a matter of run-and-gun.  And Half-Life [i]can[/i] be played that way, but it doesn't need to be.  The whole intro sequence has you commuting to work, essentially.  No guns, no combat.  The first ""weapon"" you get?  A crowbar.  And if you're particularly good with that crowbar in the very beginning, you won't even have access to a gun (in that you actually keep the security guards safe, until you encounter the first already-dead guard).

Enemy AI (not large language models, but the subroutines enemy characters perform to attack you) was also a big leap - instead of mindlessly going towards you when near, enemies will actually try to flank you, move to better vantage points, and take cover or [b]regroup to get help and attack in numbers[/b].

Half-Life also pioneered unique ways to reduce load times; most of the time, the game doesn't take long to load when going from area-to-area, and every ""level"" feels connected to a larger world.  Instead of reaching a goal with a results screen like Doom, or an ending cutscene, [i]you[/i] walk down the corridor to the next room (with maybe a 3 second pause).  YOU are the one who starts the new ""level"" by climbing up the elevator shaft.  YOU are the one in control of levels, and can sometimes move in and out of these areas.

That said, there's plenty of rough edges to the game.  Literally and figuratively.  Literally, in that the poly count is low.  It's a game from the end of the 90s, and it shows.  PROTIP: Disable texture filtering.  Textures look more pixelated, but they look a lot better, in my opinion, than when they're blurry given the low resolution.  Otherwise, the graphics certainly are primitive, but another pioneered tech is used here - skeletal animation.  Something not frequently used in games and allowed more dynamic animation options.  Audio is certainly lower quality given the time period, and there are some glitches here and there that warrant re-loading the game.  I personally had one incident towards the end of the game, one of the big bosses - it's AI broke, so instead of running away to another phase of the fight, it just... hung around and kept trying to attack me.  I had to load an earlier save, luckily one that was just before the second phase, so I didn't have to completely start from scratch.

All in all, it's a great game, and definitely worth playing.  And if you want a better experience, do NOT go for Half-Life: Source, which simply ports the game as-is to the Source Engine.  It's considered vastly inferior, however do consider Black Mesa - a fan project that completely remasters and remakes the first game, with many quality of life improvements that are found in the Source games.  It looks so good that it fits in with the Half-Life 2 games, but that's a review for another day...",1704668484,1704668484,True,1,0,0.513108611106872559,0,True,False,False

The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo radioactive decay or how long stable atoms survive. The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential (or, rarely, non-exponential) decay. For example, the medical sciences refer to the biological half-life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body. The converse of half-life (in exponential growth) is doubling time.

The original term, half-life period, dating to Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the principle in 1907, was shortened to half-life in the early 1950s.[1] Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element's half-life in studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206.

Half-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity, and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation.

For a game this old the gameplay is still really good. All enemies are different and there is quite a good variety in them, the combat in general just feels good because you have multiple ways in tackling encounters. I liked the movement too, you can bhop and surf on some surfaces, moving around in this game feels good.

The game has great atmosphere, some parts are quite scary and you really feel like Gordon Freeman. There is good variety in levels, some feel samey but they all have something unique about them. Like I already stated, some levels are a bit confusing so I had to consult a walkthrough a handful of times. I also wasn't a big fan of the last couple levels and the final boss but those are really my only complaints.

The game also supports ultrawide (21:9).

I played through the game on normal difficulty and felt like it was a decent challenge, from what I have heard hard just makes enemies damage sponges so I recommend going with normal. I did use quicksaves, without them the game would be quite hard, even on normal.

70,155351447,76561198853703957,0,7,670,0,670,1704502532,"So, Half-Life.  Some people think this game is a rip-off of the works of Stephen King, H.P. Lovecraft, and H.R. Giger.  Those people are incorrect, it also rips off the work of Clark Ashton Smith.  Valve might not think anyone knows the headcrabs are rip-offs of the leeches from Smith's short story ""The Vaults of Yoh-Vombis"" but I know, Valve.  I know.

But, obvious creative influences aside, this game is a classic because it's good.  The story is good, the world building is good, and the NPC interactions and gunplay are excellent for the 90s.  My only complain is the ladder physics.  There so bad it's distracting, because clearly everything else in the game has a lot of work put into it.  You'll constantly slip of the ladders, and when you do, you'll take a huge amount of fall damage.  Get used to hearing the H.E.V suit say ""fracture detected"" because it's going to happen a lot.  The game has some platforming sections too.  First person 3D platforming sucks even in the present, and it sucked in the 90s too.  You'll find yourself saving before every jump just because of how easy it is to miss or slip off platforms.  

Also, and this is a nit pick, it doesn't make sense that the H.E.V chargers run out of power.  It's not like the facility has a power outage or anything.  Also, why do they only charge the suit to 50 percent?  I know it makes sense from a gameplay balance perspective but it doesn't make sense from how an actual charger would work.  I mean, the first aid things only have so much healing whatever in them, but a charger is a charger.  Also, the H.E.V suit is called that for ""Hazardous Environment"" but the H.E.V charger has periods after each letter which suggest a three word name for the suit.  The chargers should say either H.E.S or H.Ev, not H.E.V.",1704503848,1704503921,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] [i] Fallout Boy - Just One Yesterday 

(Parody of ""Just One Yesterday"" by Fall Out Boy)

I thought of G-men,
In their shady black suits, man
Get them hooked on Steam deals,
See how rich I can get them
Pullin' strings in the game industry,
And clip their virtual wings,
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say ""Gabe Newell""
It will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say ""Half-Life 3""
If Half-Life's grief brings Half's reign
Then I'd trade all my sequels for just one Half-Life
I know it's bad news,
For just one Half-Life
I saved it all for you, Gabe

I want to teach you a lesson in the weirdest kind of way
Still, I'd trade all my GabeN memes for just one Half-Life
I know it's bad news,
For just one Half-Life
I saved it all for you, Gabe

G-Man's lurking, in the code so discreet,
Find yourself a new script, this game ain't big enough for two of us
I don't have the right code,
Or the right mods,
But I have twice the memes,
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say ""Gaben""
It will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say ""Gabe Newell, name""
If heaven's grief brings Valve's reign
Then I'd trade all my hat collections for just one Half-Life
I know it's bad news,
For just one Half-Life
I saved it all for you, Gabe

I want to teach you a lesson in the funniest kind of way
Still, I'd trade all my Steam cards for just one Half-Life
I know it's bad news,
For just one Half-Life
I saved it all for you, Gabe

If I spilled my game plans,
The world would never look at Steam the same way
Now, I'm here to give you all of my praise,
So I can watch your face as I take it all away, away, away, yeah

If heaven's grief brings Valve's reign
Then I'd trade all my achievements for just one Half-Life
I know it's bad news,
For just one Half-Life
I saved it all for you, Gabe

I want to teach you a lesson in the nerdiest kind of way
Still, I'd trade all my Steam sales for just one Half-Life
I know it's bad news,
For just one Half-Life
I saved it all for you, Gabe [/i] [/b]

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Half-Life, the groundbreaking first-person shooter developed by Valve Corporation, stands as a testament to the enduring brilliance of a game that has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry since its release in 1998. Even after more than two decades, Half-Life continues to captivate players with its immersive storytelling, innovative gameplay mechanics, and groundbreaking design.

One of Half-Life's defining strengths lies in its narrative execution. The game introduces players to the silent protagonist, Gordon Freeman, a scientist at the Black Mesa Research Facility. The narrative unfolds seamlessly as players traverse through the facility, encountering unforeseen consequences of an experiment gone awry. The absence of cutscenes and the immersive first-person perspective create a sense of continuous engagement, blurring the lines between player and protagonist.

The game's pacing is masterfully crafted, with tense moments of survival horror seamlessly transitioning into high-octane action sequences. Half-Life's ability to maintain a gripping narrative without ever breaking the player's immersion is a testament to its narrative sophistication, setting a benchmark for storytelling in the FPS genre.

In terms of innovation, Half-Life introduced a groundbreaking approach to environmental storytelling and level design. The game relies on minimalistic HUD elements, encouraging players to observe their surroundings for vital information. Each level is meticulously designed, creating a sense of realism and cohesion within the game world. The use of scripted events and dynamic AI further enhances the overall sense of immersion, making every playthrough a unique experience.

A major highlight of Half-Life is the introduction of the Gravity Gun in Half-Life 2, the sequel released in 2004. This iconic weapon revolutionized the gaming landscape, allowing players to manipulate objects in the environment creatively. The physics-based gameplay added a layer of complexity and innovation that was unparalleled at the time and continues to influence game design to this day.

Half-Life's impact on the multiplayer gaming scene is equally noteworthy, with the release of Counter-Strike, a mod developed for the original game. This mod went on to become one of the most popular online shooters, showcasing the modding potential inherent in the Half-Life engine.

In conclusion, Half-Life is not merely a game; it's a timeless masterpiece that has shaped the gaming landscape. Its narrative sophistication, innovative gameplay mechanics, and pioneering design elements set a standard that few games have been able to match. Even after more than two decades, Half-Life remains a must-play for both nostalgic fans and new generations of gamers, standing tall as a testament to the enduring brilliance of a true gaming classic.",1704371836,1704371836,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

70,152440384,76561198137876548,0,1,1238,0,1238,1701163813,"This game is old. That is not a bad thing, people still play games like Age of Empires II and that one came out a year after Half-Life. Older games that were successful back in the day may fall in the pits of nostalgia, and a fresher look sometimes reveal shortcomings. The 25th anniversary seemed like a good time to revisit the game and see if it holds up. I may be biased as I did play the game many years ago, but my nostalgia lies closer to the sequel, Half-Life 2.

Let's start with the performance: being old, the game can run on low end computers without issues ([i] the reviewer used an almost 10 years old laptop[/i] ). This is not one of those games that refuses to work in newer OS ( [i] Windows 10 here [/i] ).

The graphics hold up, the style and the lighting carry the game but whenever you are outside the research complex you remember more acutely that this game is 25 years old, with some low-res textures. The NPCs also show the game's age (don't expect fully modeled hair strands).

The sound department is top notch. The many weapons sounds are appropriate and feel impactful. Each enemy has a set of sounds and you will end identifying many of them first by sound. On top of that, you can tell where the noise comes from, more so if you are using a headset; you may not see an enemy right away but you can tell they are nearby.
Music is used sparingly, but when it shows up you're in for a ride (don't forget to add the soundtrack to your Steam account, it's free).

Gameplay is interesting. While mainly a FPS, Half-Life uses a lot of platforming, you will be jumping all over the place, but there's plenty of more conventional shooting. Did I hear shooting? This game has a lot of weapons, not just guns, each one with their own ammo and, while some weapons are stronger than others, you will end using all of them, as some are better suited for certain tasks.

The AI does its job. The NPCs don't stay still waiting for you to shoot them, in fact different enemies behave in unique ways, in time you will learn their behaviour. At certain points friendly NPCs will be needed to advance the game but thankfully there are not escort missions.

All the previous points come together to create set pieces, where the player will have to use all these elements to solve a puzzle of sorts. Here the physics of the game will come into play. The game is linear, you go from one crafted experience to the next, but still there's a degree of exploration at points that rewards the player with more resources for the challenges ahead. There are no quick time events, but the game will demand reflexes to overcome its challenges. Sometimes you may dislike one section of the game, but the next one most likely will attempt something different. Now, being honest, the ending of the game will increase the platforming to a point some will find annoying since the gravity pull will be decreased, but these are short levels and not bad enough to ruin the game.

Still unsure? Well, this game has labcoats, grenades, a monorail system, water terror, waste management, a lack of OSHA regulations, gruesome deaths, air ducts and much, much more. Also, there's multiplayer, if you want to try free form gameplay.

Now, some [b] advice [/b] sounds nice. First, your game may have auto-aim on by default; if you are using the good old keyboard/mouse combo, you may feel it's redundant, it's easy to turn off in the settings. Second, some of the platforming is finicky; if you doubt wheter you can make the jump, quick save (F6 by default) before painfully crashing to chain attempts with quick load (F7 by default). Occasionally the game may have minor issues, loading a previous save will solve them (the game autosaves frequently). Also, yes, you can destroy [spoiler] the tanks [/spoiler] , they don't show the damage until they explode, so you may wonder if you are wasting ammo.

In sum, I recommend this game. Some of its ideas are more commonplace nowadays but you will still have a good time.",1701189173,1704222839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having played it now, years after its initial release in 1998, I'm thrilled to say that it still holds up remarkably well.

The game's strength lies in its ability to blend a compelling narrative with immersive gameplay seamlessly. The story unfolds organically, eschewing cutscenes, and instead, relies on environmental storytelling and scripted events that keep you engaged. It's a testament to Valve's innovative design philosophy, which was groundbreaking at the time and still feels fresh today.

Graphically, whilst it shows its age, there's a certain charm to the visuals that adds to the game's nostalgic value. The level design is intricate and thoughtfully laid out, encouraging exploration and rewarding curiosity. The sound design, from the eerie silence of deserted labs to the sudden, heart-pounding music during action sequences, adds to the overall atmosphere, making Black Mesa feel like a real, lived-in place.

Half-Life's gameplay is a balanced mix of puzzle-solving, exploration, and combat. The AI of both allies and enemies is impressive, even by today's standards. The weapon variety and the innovative use of the Gravity Gun provide a satisfying combat experience.

However, it's not without its flaws. The platforming sections can be frustrating, and some might find the graphics too dated. But these are minor gripes in what is otherwise a masterful piece of gaming history.

To new players, Half-Life offers a glimpse into the evolution of the FPS genre, and to veterans, it's a nostalgic trip back to one of the finest games ever made. It's a must-play, not just for fans of the genre, but for anyone interested in the history of video games. Valve didn't just make a game; they crafted a legacy that has stood the test of time.

Not sure if it was just my particular hardware setup that caused issues, or if it was broken for most folks.  I tried different workarounds and nothing would allow it to run.  Now with the changes to the Anniversary update, it works and I can have resolutions that work fine with my 50 in TV and the controller support is pretty decent also.  I know that is pry heresy to the old school diehards who only use keyboard and mouse, but sometimes its nice to just pick up the controller and play.  Funny though as they said they had supposedly fixed some bugs that had been in the game since its original release.  I guess not being aware of all of those bugs at this point, its hard to say, but it makes me laugh as the game definitely is bug free, but it plays well enough to be enjoyable and playable at least through the first half.  I haven't made it to Xen yet, but should be pretty close.  Will be cool to go back and play the original Xen levels again as I had been playing through Black Mesa after they finished releasing the Xen levels.  Of course the Xen in Black Mesa had quite a bit of additions and changes, so again, will be cool to see how the original went.  There were other things from the original game I hadn't remembered being as it has been so long, so its definitely cool to go back and rediscover the game.  Just like the Duke Nukem anniversary release, this is packed full of nostalgic goodness.  Maybe they will even release some additional story missions like DN did, who knows!",1704143932,1704143932,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo radioactive decay or how long stable atoms survive. The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential (or, rarely, non-exponential) decay. For example, the medical sciences refer to the biological half-life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body. The converse of half-life (in exponential growth) is doubling time.

The original term, half-life period, dating to Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the principle in 1907, was shortened to half-life in the early 1950s.[1] Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element's half-life in studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206.

Half-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity, and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation. The accompanying table shows the reduction of a quantity as a function of the number of half-lives elapsed.

Either way, can't sex Freeman.

Well I played it for a bit, and my god for 1998 this IS the game that defined a major change in how a fps story and game play is told, I can see why even after 25 years since it's release why Half-life is such an important game.

 You can even see a lot of early tropes that modern fps use to this day, if you are a fps lover this is a must complete. 

Just be kind to yourself and play on medium or easy, this game was not designed with a hard difficulty in mind.

The sound design is also top notch. The world feels alive and real. The guns sound crisp. The soundtrack, though rare, shines when it arrives.

Often you are required to jump to a ladder, and you will fall to your death because you don't stick. I had to look it up and it turns out you can't have any buttons held in before touching a ladder. Why? I dunno, but that's a terrible mechanic. Getting off of ladders is clunky too. 

Has cheap difficulty, often enemies will pop out of nowhere with no warning. I remember getting shot to death by turrets because two Vortigunts spawned behind me and activated the laser sensor. Has cheap hazards like things suddenly falling from the ceiling that do a ton of damage that wait for you to get close before it activates with no warning. You're forced to take things slow to avoid those hazards. The way hazards activate you'd think you were playing on a Death Run server.

Blast Pit is a bad example. Has a tentacle monster that can keep hitting you while you can't kill it. Only stun each tentacle (for a very short time) separately with your guns and explosives. God forbid you run out of ammo. It's possible to distract it by banging on the walls on the outside before going in. Or you can throw a grenade to lure it to wherever you threw it. But the game doesn't tell you ANY of this. I had to look it up. 

Before I found out about the grenade trick, I was trying to sneak past the monster and got to the third ladder, then there's a bunch of ḟṵcking boxes blocking the top. So in order to climb through you have to destroy the boxes, which makes noise, then the monster knows where you are and kills you.  

If you don't bang on the walls and sneak, the monster will camp at the doorway waiting for you to enter so it can attack you right away. Which then, spamming your weapons to stun is the only way past. And you'll take a bunch of damage in the process. Horrible game design.

There are multiple points in the game where you can get softlocked out of progression because your HP is too low. Like fall damage from high jumps or long falls you have to do to get to the next area. Rooms filled with smg & grenade spamming soldiers coming from multiple sides. Instant death, no time to shoot back and kill them. If you have no armor and low health left, you're just sḧít out of luck alot of the time. 

Then you have the bugs, parts of the map that move that you're meant to stand on can instakill you if you collide with them wrong. On the elevator in Power Up, if you kill the soldiers while they're still on it. Then you ride the elevator while touching the bodies, you'll explode. No, really. And railroad thing you drive can explode you too if you touch it the wrong way. I found that out trying to jump back on it while it was passing by and ended up touching a front corner.

The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo radioactive decay or how long stable atoms survive. The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential (or, rarely, non-exponential) decay. For example, the medical sciences refer to the biological half-life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body. The converse of half-life (in exponential growth) is doubling time.

The original term, half-life period, dating to Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the principle in 1907, was shortened to half-life in the early 1950s. Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element's half-life in studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206.

Half-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity, and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation. The accompanying table shows the reduction of a quantity as a function of the number of half-lives elapsed. 

Probabilistic nature

A half-life often describes the decay of discrete entities, such as radioactive atoms. In that case, it does not work to use the definition that states ""half-life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay"". For example, if there is just one radioactive atom, and its half-life is one second, there will not be ""half of an atom"" left after one second.

Instead, the half-life is defined in terms of probability: ""Half-life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay on average"". In other words, the probability of a radioactive atom decaying within its half-life is 50%.

For example, the accompanying image is a simulation of many identical atoms undergoing radioactive decay. Note that after one half-life there are not exactly one-half of the atoms remaining, only approximately, because of the random variation in the process. Nevertheless, when there are many identical atoms decaying (right boxes), the law of large numbers suggests that it is a very good approximation to say that half of the atoms remain after one half-life.

Various simple exercises can demonstrate probabilistic decay, for example involving flipping coins or running a statistical computer program.",1703623338,1703623338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Main article: Unfree labour
See also: Human trafficking
Forced labour, or unfree labour, is sometimes used to describe an individual who is forced to work against their own will, under threat of violence or other punishment. This may also include institutions not commonly classified as slavery, such as serfdom, conscription and penal labour. As slavery has been legally outlawed in all countries, forced labour in the present day (frequently referred to as ""modern slavery"") revolves around illegal control.

Human trafficking primarily involves women and children forced into prostitution and is the fastest growing form of forced labour, with Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico having been identified as leading hotspots of commercial sexual exploitation of children.[37][38]",1703542087,1703542087,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Ingredients
110g/4oz butter or margarine softened at room temperature
110g/4oz caster sugar
2 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
1 tsp vanilla extract
110g/4oz self-raising flour
1–2 tbsp milk
For the icing
300g/10½oz icing sugar
2–3 tbsp water
2–3 drops food colouring
hundreds and thousands, or other cake decorations

Method
Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and line 2 x 12-hole fairy cake tins with paper cases.

Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale. Beat in the eggs, a little at a time, and stir in the vanilla extract.

Fold in the flour using a large metal spoon. Add a little milk until the mixture is a soft dropping consistency and spoon the mixture into the paper cases until they are half full.

Bake in the oven for 8–10 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into one of the cakes comes out clean. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes, then remove from the tin and cool on a wire rack.

For the icing, sift the icing sugar into a large mixing bowl and stir in enough water to create a smooth mixture. Stir in the food colouring.

To ice the fairy cakes, drizzle the icing over the cakes, sprinkle with decorations and set aside until the icing hardens.",1702331243,1703169857,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Let's talk about the story—utterly captivating. From the moment Gordon Freeman steps off that tram into the Black Mesa Research Facility, you're hooked. It's a rollercoaster of scientific mishaps, interdimensional chaos, and a silent protagonist who communicates more with a crowbar than most characters do with their entire script. The narrative is so engaging that it's like being pulled into a gripping sci-fi novel that you can't put down.

The gameplay is a perfect blend of action, exploration, and puzzle-solving. It's the kind of experience that keeps you on your toes, whether you're fending off headcrabs, navigating precarious platforming sections, or outsmarting the enigmatic G-Man. The level design is a work of art, with each environment seamlessly weaving into the next, creating a cohesive and immersive world.

And let's not forget the revolutionary AI of the time. The enemies felt intelligent, reacting dynamically to your actions, making every encounter a thrilling dance of wits. The iconic crowbar became more than a weapon; it became a symbol of survival and a tool for breaking through the unexpected.

The graphics, while dated by today's standards, were groundbreaking in their time. The atmospheric and immersive environments, coupled with the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, created an experience that transcended mere gaming. It was a journey into the unknown, where every corner held the promise of a new discovery or a deadly threat.

In conclusion, Half-Life isn't just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon that redefined the first-person shooter genre. It's a timeless classic that continues to inspire and influence game developers to this day. Gordon Freeman's journey through Black Mesa is not just a game; it's an unforgettable adventure that has left an indelible mark on the hearts of gamers worldwide.",1703103514,1703103514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Half-Life came out in my early teens. You've heard the story a million times but it really completely changed things. Especially for me since I hadn't played many FPS games prior. I simply didn't think video games could be... This. I was lost in this game. Absorbed in it. Every vent, every gun, every sequence, I loved it. Even Xen. I'm a Xen apologist through and through. It was daunting and alien. There isn't a moment in Half-Life I wasn't sweating during that virgin(in more ways than one) playthrough. While the illusion is long gone and I know how to fly through the game and beat the bosses, I still remember the way it all felt the first time, every time.

Half-Life is the perfect game to me. You just always remember your first. The level design is as good as it gets, still. And the way the narrative is told ambiguously through play still rarely gets matched all these years later. It has more of a sense of freedom than some open world games even though it's linear. I can't gush enough. It came together at the perfect time in gaming history with the right recipe of love and deadline crunch. It can't, hasn't, and won't ever be improved in my eyes. I even put it, well, ahead of HL2 (there are dozens of us, dozens!).

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

You truly feel like your actions are making an impact and changing the outcome of the narrative. 

The gameplay is incredibly fun, with an engaging core loop and a wide variety of weapons to unlock that change the way you approach combat. With the stakes consistently heightening, and the enemies getting stronger, the game never feels too easy and poses an enjoyable challenge. This is well complemented by the Music and sound effects that emphasise every moment and event. 

All this is wrapped within a gripping story that hosts a wide variety of twist and turns and suspenseful moments that are seamlessly blended into the gameplay through a wide variety of events. 

It’s no wonder that Half-Life was an instant hit on release and has become a classic over the years. This is a must play that I would recommend to anyone.

Despite the graphics not being nearly as impressive nowadays, the intense moments feel as good as (probably even better than) a 2023 shooter. I bought Half-Life after Portal, which introduced me to Valve games. The plot is tied with Portal nice. If you get this game, I recommend getting the Complete Half-Life bundle, so you don't have to pull out your wallet to play the next game. (Also because playing hl2 in GMod with infinite ammo, weapons, and whatever else I want is nearly as fun as the actual game), and also GMod (for the actual game, and because HL:Source sucks and is only useful for GMod assets)

TL;DR:
Graphics: 3/10 (its a 1998 game, but good for its time)
Gameplay: 10/10 (though sometimes can be a bit hard)

Half-Life 1 honestly is a great game. Even despite it's age I've found much enjoyment in it and the 25 year anniversary made me really happy too! But there is also a problem with it... it often isnt clear where you're supposed to go. Take surfice tension as an example. The area right before the minefield literally has BOTH ways opstructed by big rocks. Also, playing on hard can be quite frustrating the first time around as the enemys literally have the worst case of ""minor aimbot"" I've seen in a while (although Black mesa might actually be worse in that regard).  Still 
even with it's faults HL1 is pretty fun. Especially after the first playthrough! I'd give it an 8/10 but because of the infinite health doors it's actually a 9/10. Good game.",1702751065,1702753269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]""Good morning and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System.""[/b]

Half-Life.
Just the mere mention of its name is enough to give you chills.
Many consider it the greatest FPS of all time.
Valve's founding FPS is such a masterpiece that we still feel its aura today.
Named ""Game of the Year"" by more than 50 magazines, it is a cult title.
It even made the terms ""Doom-Like"" and ""Quake-Like"" obsolete.
Without forgetting that this is the beginning of Valve's success story.
Is it even possible to do a purely objective review for Half-Life?

[b]""They're waiting for you, Gordon. In the test chamber.""[/b]

Gordon Freeman is a scientist with a degree in theoretical physics from M.I.T., specializing in the research of ""Anomalous Materials"".
He is employed at the prestigious Black Mesa scientific complex.
Freeman is is entrusted with an experiment of capital importance: 
the analysis of a crystal of alien origin.
Unfortunately, contact of the sample with the anti-mass spectrometer
has ""Unforeseen Consequences"".
This leads to a ""Resonance Cascade"" of phenomenal power, 
partially destroying the research center.
Worse still, it opened an interdimensional breach through which warlike aliens emerge...
The army was called to the rescue, but was ordered to kill all the witnesses...
Gordon must then fight his way to save his colleagues and escape this hell.

[b]""You aren't scared, are you?""[/b]

One of the great strengths of Half-Life is its storytelling.
You play as Gordon Freeman and see everything through his eyes.
No cutscene or dialogue intersperses the scientist's adventures.
Everything is done so that you identify as best as possible with the character, a hero in spite of himself.

[b]""Run. Think. Shoot. Live.""[/b]

Half-Life is the ultimate evolution of the 90s FPS.
It's no longer just a question of taking down enemies.
Puzzles push you to interact with the world to progress,
use levers, valves, push or pull crates, etc...
There are even vehicle sequences, with a tram ""On a Rail"".
The gunfights are breathtaking, the AI ​​is very clever.

[b]""Oh my God...we're doomed!""[/b]

Black Mesa is invaded by all kinds of creatures from Xen.
The soldiers shoots on sight at everything that moves, the aliens as well as the employees of the Research Center.
The Half-Life bestiary is rich and varied, each of the NPCs or creatures, allies and enemies alike, has its own behavior and animations.

The scientists and the security guards are your friends and colleagues, they only want the best for you.
In addition to giving you advices, they open certain locked doors. 
The scientists can heal you if you're wounded, and the ""Barneys"" can easily kill aliens like Headcrabs or Vortigaunts...

The Xen creatures are very different from each other but they all have one thing in common:
They're after you. 
Here is the list of all these alien monsters:

Headcrabs
Zombies
Vortigaunts
Houndeyes
Barnacles
Bullsquid
Tentacles
Gargantuas
Ichthyosaurs
Alien Grunts
Alien Controllers

The H.E.C.U. has been dispatched to the Research Center to stem the alien invasion,
and do everything to prevent the Black Mesa disaster from becoming known. 
These soldiers are battle-hardened, intelligent and brutal.
They have, among other things, machine guns, heavy cannons, automatic turrets,
Apache & Osprey Helicopters, F16 fighter jets, Abrams & Bradley Armored Tanks...

Black Ops Assassins are special enemies: they are the only women we fight.
An Assassin is as agile as a Kunoichi, dressed all in black.
They are as fast as lightning, and can perform spectacular jumps.
They're equipped with a silent Glock, and a huge and magnificent pair of... 
grenades attached to the belt.

[b]""Welcome to the H.E.V. Mark IV protective system, 
for use in hazardous environment conditions.""[/b]

The H.E.V. Mark IV protective system is the orange suit worn by Gordon Freeman.
It is the main equipment of the series, it bears the λ symbol .
Gordon Freeman resists radioactivity, burns, electricity, and chemicals thanks to it.
It absorbs a large part of the damage received, and can be recharged using H.E.V. chargers or batteries.
The Long Jump Module allows Gordon to make great leaps forward, which proves very useful later.

[b]""Gordon doesn't need to hear all this. He's a highly trained professional.""[/b]

Despite his appearance as a simple scientist, Gordon Freeman handles weapons to perfection, thanks to the time he spent in the ""Hazard Course"".
The weapons are very numerous and varied, classic or experimental, and even a few of alien origin...
Here's the full list of weapons:

Crowbar
Pistol
Shotgun
SMG or AR
Revolver
Crossbow
Rocket Launcher
Grenade
Tripmine
C4
Snark
Hivehand
Gauss Gun
Gluon Gun

[b]""Those new suits can be tricky. Please proceed to the next area.""[/b]

Hazard Course is Black Mesa's training space for H.E.V suit users.
This is the one and only tutorial present in Half-Life, made to familiarize yourself with the game's mechanics.

[b]""Hey, did you hear something?""[/b]

The music and sounds in Half-Life are of high quality.
They were composed by Kelly Bailey.
Each important moment in the game has its own music, sometimes gloomy, sometimes epic.
""Hazardous Environments"", the Valve Theme, which gives you chills during the fight on the edge of the cliff in ""Surface Tension""...

All human characters are voiced, and each monster has its own sounds.
It's easy to know which enemy to face next without even seeing it.
Every sound accentuate the science fiction touch and the player's immersion.
The voice of the H.E.V. Suit gives valuable information on the environment, health status or quantity of ammunition.

[b]""You sure we're going the right way?""[/b]

The graphics of Half-Life are sumptuous for its time, thanks to the GoldSrc engine.
The game became more beautiful and detailed when it was (re)released on Steam.
The settings are particularly immersive and varied.

[b]""Didn't want to die alone anyway.""[/b]

In addition to its extraordinary single-player campaign, 
Half-Life has a classic multiplayer deathmatch mode.
The fights are fun, dynamic and brutal, 
thanks to the large quantity weapons available to players.
In addition to that, 
there's a plethoric choice of 18 maps and they're different enough to renew the gaming experience.

[b]""Catch me later, I'll buy you a beer.""[/b]

2023 marks the 25th anniversary of Half-Life, which Valve celebrated with a content-rich update.
First of all, the main menu of the game has been replaced by that of the WON version: it is the original menu from 1998.
The original Valve intro is also restored.

It finally brings Half-Life Uplink to Steam, which we've been waiting for so long.
Half-Life Uplink is a unique Half-Life demo, released in early 1999.
This level never appeared in the original game, it was a standalone only.

Four new multiplayer maps are added, and three from the Half-Life: Further Data additional content CD.

Four new multiplayer skins are added, including Ivan The Space Biker and Proto-Barney, from the 1997 Alpha Version

[b]""Another important species revealed in action.""[/b]

In addition to being an exceptional game, Half-Life gave birth to a large number of cult multiplayer FPS franchises:
Day of Defeat, Team Fortress, and Counter-Strike.

[b]""I predicted all of this, you know. All of it!""[/b]

Half-Life is a remarkably effective FPS.
How can we not praise such a masterpiece?
This video game monument is timeless.
There is clearly a before and after Half-Life.
Every gamer must own it.",1295020659,1702613849,True,81,2,0.884201228618621826,106,True,False,False

it holds up really well.  it's still fun.  it's not precisely a first person shooter; your mousing skills aren't that important compared to figuring out how to approach each area.  so it's a shooting puzzle game, and sometimes just a puzzle game.

on reflection it does this mechanic as well or better than any other game i've played.  even hl2 lets you brute-force the puzzles with good shooting.

the story is simple but carries you along, and the sound design is neat.  it's also a piece of history and hugely infuential.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3112680756

I can however assert that it still holds up immaculately today. Does it show its age? Of course. Although I'd argue that considering its age, it's still a pretty stunning looking game. Does it actually add to the game’s charm? Definitely. Plus, it’s a literal piece of gaming history, and funny enough, the gameplay is still better than a lot of modern shooters.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3113427468

I don’t remember enough of my previous playthroughs to definitively discuss how the recent (as of the time of this writing) update changes things, but I did feel like parts of the level design here and there had been tweaked. I also note that it ran immaculately on the Steam Deck, which of course it should, being as how Valve is the creator of both.

Is there still some wonk? Yes. Ladders still aren’t your friends. Some of the platforming I still consider to be a hassle. The final boss fight is still kinda meh IMO.

But, beyond those minor complaints, as mentioned before, this game holds up remarkably well, and I feel like you owe it to yourself to play it again, or for the first time, before it truly does age beyond what people are mostly willing to accept. If that’s actually possible, which I’m not certain of since 25 years did nothing to squash its viability.

One further note about Steam Deck play. It was incredibly battery friendly. I was getting close to the full six hours on default settings. Which was maybe the biggest surprise of all.

And as an interesting side note: while Valve is a massive powerhouse these days despite maintaining what would be considered a modest staff, Half Life released while Valve was still a completely Indie studio, with Sierra Entertainment being their publisher. Funny how, in a very real sense, Valve has never forgotten their modest beginnings despite Steam being an outrageous success.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3113566770

Half Life was free recently in honor of the 25th Anniversary, but if you missed it and somehow don’t own it, it’s like 99 cents during every major Steam Sale. Play it and enjoy a timeless (so far) piece of gaming history.

Now I understand why people rave about it and fully agree that for a linear shooter adventure, there are not many (if any) games in the recent years which compare to the silky smooth flow of the game. Playing this after watching the mini documentary made certain aspects of the game sink in even more (ie. when the devs said they aimed to have some form of event/action every 3-5 seconds). If you focus on the content, the level design, the flow, the pacing of platformer vs shooting vs puzzle solving and the deeper aspects of game design, it is a master piece (except for Xen). 

All that praise aside, be ready for a few annoyances (not game breaking but a wee-bit annoying and just a product of the time the game was made) such as rather finicky jump controls (especially on Xen), helicopters with seemingly x-ray vision picking you off in tunnels, some of the platforming sections are a touch tedious/annoying. I repeat, these are nitpicks. 

Overall, glad I played this classic and would highly recommend it to anyone ESPECIALLY if you are into game design and/or a game director. A lot can still be learned from this game.",1702461455,1702461455,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

70,153416609,76561198082520150,108,9,1801,0,1767,1706045465,"this is a game that i had first started playing over a year ago at the recommendation of some friends who thought i'd like the lore (i'm a big fan of portal's story so it's almost a disservice not to have gone through this series yet anyways), getting only about a quarter of the way through, and just now i went back and replayed through the whole thing to completion.

to me, half-life is a game that excels mostly in combat variety and environmental storytelling. you amass a large arsenal of different weapons through this game and the maps feature unique ways of taking out threats which always keeps things interesting (whether those methods are intentional or not lol).

while the game lacks explicit explanations about what's going on and has sparse dialogue, it tells a fascinating story mostly through the level design alone. [spoiler] i found it really cool how you could see fights breaking out between marines and xen aliens in a TON of different areas. it went a long way in helping the world and the conflict feel alive, while also allowing for strategic opportunities where you could balance out the conflict from the sidelines to ensure both sides go down at once! every area in the game looks strikingly unique, from the sprawling black mesa facilities to the sandy canyons of the surface to the grotesque and abstract structures of xen. [/spoiler]  

however, it is important to recognize that this game was made over 25 years ago now, and shows its age in its core design. the variety is really the only thing that the combat has going for it, as the enemies have pretty funky ai that doesn't really know how to react if you play in any way that isn't just rushing in guns blazing. the game also feels reliant on the player saving and loading multiple times over to learn enemy spawns and create the best outcome. for every scenario where you can identify a set of enemies from a distance and dispatch them strategically, there is another scenario where an alien spawns in on a bridge and breaks it, making you fall with it in a panic while you're being pummeled to death, or where an additional wave of enemies shows up by surprise and wipes you out while you're distracted by the first. perhaps these events exist to balance out the enemies not knowing how to react when you're the one who's approaching, which is when their ai is most able to be abused, but it is still frustrating nonetheless.

overall, half-life is at most a fun, classic game where you're a cool dude in a suit with an assortment of powerful weapons, set out to stop the alien invasion that you started. as you go, you stun the world around you by being the sole person who doesn't break out into dance or decide to blow themselves and their squad to smoldering smithereens with a hand grenade when they get damaged.  and at the very least, half-life is a fascinating time capsule into the state of games at the time of its creation, highlighting where things once were and how much they've progressed over the quarter of a century. whether you like it or not, its influence continues to run deep, and it's something you can really see around you after playing through it. also of course got valve started so this game's awesome for that alone

Built on a heavily modified version of the Quake Engine (known as GoldSrc), this game was groundbreaking at the time, and while it was definitely not the first FPS game, it set a new standard for future FPS games that have a huge element of storytelling. It amazes me that this was Valve's first game ever made because this was one of the best FPS games I've ever played. The gunplay feels satisfying, the AI (while not perfect) was pretty decent, and there were only a few bugs I encountered which says a lot due to how long this game is.

Gordon Freeman's hazard suit is the epitome of workplace fashion. Who needs a tailored suit when you can rock the hazardous look?

Black Mesa is the place to be if you're a scientist looking to advance your career. Just ignore the resonance cascade on your way to the coffee machine – nothing to see here.

Commuting between dimensions can be a hassle. One moment you're sipping coffee in the office lounge, and the next, you're battling alien invaders. Who knew the morning rush hour could get this intense?

Apparently, getting a Ph.D. in theoretical physics makes you the universe's target for alien invasions. Note to self: reconsider career choices.

Gordon Freeman has a severe case of silent protagonist syndrome. I mean, he's saving the world, but can't he spare a word or two? Maybe a ""How's it going, headcrab?"" would be nice.

In conclusion, Half-Life is the workplace simulation we never knew we needed. It's a hazardous fashion show, a lesson in theoretical physics, and a crowbar-wielding adventure all rolled into one. Gordon Freeman, you stylish, silent hero – may your hazard suit stay fashionable, and may the resonance cascade always keep things interesting.

Valve is the undisputed master of the subtle shift. Paradigm adjustments to the current trends of the gaming world and always having some level of a hand involved, even when most people are just writing them off because we haven't seen a new game in a decade. They have the same energy as Carmack, except spread out through an entire cabal of goons. But they're always there in some capacity, even when you don't see them. It was Newell's team that took DOOM from DOS to Windows, and made it a monolith that's stood to this day. They're the ones to revolutionize the 3D Gaming Industry two separate times in a six year span, and make an online gaming platform so nuke proof that almost two decades later, there's no real competition and Epic can't sue their way out of it. And even when we think they're done, out pops another new thing.

All of that really starts with Half-Life. This is not simply a ""revolutionary"" game, this is a cornerstone. This is a foundational brick in the wider walls of modern gaming. This shook everything from simple graphical advancements and gameplay technology to the way other games structure their story, pace themselves and reveal the wider petals of the plot. Every game for a decade copied Half Life, whether openly or otherwise and none of them were able to fully capture the magic. The only person to come close was Bungie, and even they knew the winning move was not to play. Merely adopt and improve. 

It's all little details effortlessly thrown in, from the various Chekhov's Guns of the G-Man, the overarching plot culminating in a tram ride in the abyss and the various hints along the way. You're not a divine super soldier, you're a 27 year old theoretical physicist who just so happened to be wearing his suit when he ripped a hole through time and space. You're another pawn on a chessboard too high for you to see the pattern of, and all you can do is watch. Watch, and accidentally kill yourself with snarks again because you forgot how fast they bounce around a small room.

I could wax poetic about Half Life's virtues for hours, but I won't. You know it's fantastic already. I'll instead leave this review with a perfect summation of this game and Valve as a whole. When this game came out, the current reigning champ of graphics and storytelling was Unreal by Epic Games. 8 months later, Epic had a dev team push out the Return to Na Pali expansion, which added a centralized story and various ""improvements"" that feel like a pallid attempt to catch up to Valve. And then they would do Unreal 2. And while working on the groundwork for another game, Valve would oh-so-casually release Half Life 2. And then suddenly all further Unreal games were merely tournament shooters. 

Take the hint, Sweeney.",1701837428,1701837428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

THE GAME YOU WOULD NOT REALLY WANT TO REPLAY WITH POOR STICK AN SLIDE AND JUMP CONTROLS THEY DO NOT WORK WITH PUZZLE FROM HELL: This is what has been the style of all the half life games ""but the first half life 2"" is the only one that works only do to it is more combat than puzzle so far less frustration along with the light that has no real long charge ability and in the dark areas. 
They could not even make it a campaign Co-Op so what the big dam deal it's just stupid Multiplayer play kill each other with out the cool story 25 years to put out this whatever but thanks for the full screen add on and other real need graphic updates awesome.
All their games are like resident evil who claim this too, with broken controls that they claim is their style and that is what makes their games different but i feel that is what really is broken and not a good Mechanic's.  
A Big Thanks to the Developers working with the Moders in mods 
through Steam we are getting games fixed and Balanced, 
thus making for positive Reviews. But not fun to replay:

Everything from the flat repeating textures, to the strange reverberations of your footsteps off different materials, to the npcs sounding like they're talking through walkie talkies takes you into the gritty, bleak setting of the game.
Imagine my surprise when, instead of a hour or two long game like the first portal, I found myself plunged into a 11 hour experience. Don't be fooled, this game is TOUGH! I was constantly at low health, so the frequent health stations and pickups were a life saver.
My only complaint would be with the final boss being a bit clunky and unclear as to what to do. Might've been just me, but even coming off the self-directed nature of the rest of the game, I found myself a bit confused and frustrated during the boss.

The highest difficulty SUCKS and is not how you should play the game, to be clear I like a challenge but this isnt a that, its just higher health pools for enemies and more damage dealt by them too. They all feel like sponges in the end and I would have loved a more challenging highest difficulty rather than a more boring one. 

The platforming is not good, there isnt a lot of it but its still not very good, maybe its a skill issue and I need to play the game again but I didnt like it, didnt hate it though.

Xen sucks and its very unfortunate that the game ends on such a low note when the rest of the campaign was great.

The mechanics, challenges, and puzzles you encounter throughout the game keep you engaged, entertained, and immersed in the world of Black Messa. The visuals, while of course not realistic, are still pleasing and nice in spite of such.

If there HAD to be something to criticise about the game, some of the movement controls (especially jumping) can take a short while to get used to. But with time you'll be able to grasp it. There are also ""some"" visual bugs I encountered but they were extremely insignificant and depending on how you're playing, you may not even encounter them at all.

There's many cases where I say, ""This is a good place to save and continue later"" and then just go on progressing and saving again for another hour without even feeling it. 
Half life is giving me a really nostalgic feeling of old school games . And also I feel for the first time in a while, I'm actually playing a game that isn't playing itself for me, or that it is backseating me.

There's no pointers to the goal, no map, no quest line, no popups everywhere, just raw gaming time, and I gotta say, it feels so much greater playing and advancing this way. I died a lot, I learned form my experience, 
 and then I figured out the way forward. 

Loved the show, don't tell, approach of half life as well.
You notice little hints and details in the environment that allow you to figure out what to do. It was kind of a shock how used to being shown a pointer to where to go I've been. It feels more rewarding to figure out the puzzles and to advance in your own accord. I felt more in control and immersed, and continuing the mission was accompanied with great storytelling. So great. It's miles better from getting solution to your situation spelled out for you.

It also came with a MP part, which was outshined  by the free mod ""Counter-Strike"", nonetheless it was an enjoyable attachment, as well as the ability to create mods, which the community put good use of.

What we have here is a free update of the classic game that adds support for higher resolutions, wide-screen aspect ratio and numerous other ""under the hood"" improvements which will surely benefit the existing modding scene.

For a limited time, it was free to grab for all Steam users, but even at the current price, it's worth it, as it's one of the best FPS, and generally speaking, games ever made.",1701631435,1701631435,True,16,0,0.690118312835693359,0,True,False,False

I just don't see it as a masterpiece everyone claims it to be. I beat it for the first time earlier this year and I wasn't impressed. I played it again for 25th anniversary, and my opinion hasn't changed very much.

I think it's consistently frustrating - there's a lot of poor enemy placements, like headcrabs in vents early on. Are they supposed to be scary? I found them more annoying than anything. Or [url=https://i.imgur.com/JWhXYQI.jpg]when you see a medical terminal[/url], and then [url=https://i.imgur.com/1BLqe6e.jpg]an enemy[/url] spawns behind you. Or cheap moments like [url=https://i.imgur.com/h2Dovhi.jpg]this sniper[/url] that isn't very obvious. The game baits you with a health pickup, only to deliver a middle finger. Or [url=https://i.imgur.com/zQGbQLh.jpg]or this normal looking cracked wall texture[/url]? Except [url=https://i.imgur.com/FWQ7RBM.jpg]it's not and will rain you with bricks[/url] (doesn't do a lot of damage, but still kind of annoying). Or [url=https://i.imgur.com/pYkUaxp.jpg]this structure[/url] full of teleports? They may teleport you forward, or towards bonuses... or straight up cheap death. How generous.

I could go on, but I hope I won't have to list more examples. I just don't think [b]Half-Life[/b] holds up all that well. Even physics aren't very good, when you have a bunch of platforming and you're awfully slippery, falling to your death is not uncommon. Air mobility is poor, and ladders are janky as hell. You have to realize that the game may not be so kind to first time players... or even second time players in my case.

So... why recommend anyway, despite it supposedly not being all that great? Well, it IS one of THE games of all time. You should check it out and make your own judgement. You may find this game to hold up just fine, or find it to be an infuriating piece of garbage. And it's not without merit - it's immersive, while there are some pacing issues, it's mostly pretty good - there are almost no cutscenes to stop you and you can ignore NPCs if you know what to do already. Everything happens in real time. The gunplay is also decent. There must be a reason why it's so beloved. It may not be my cup of tea, but it's still an interesting piece of gaming history.

I think the gameplay has aged quite well, and although it's simple compared to modern titles, it has a ""be smart, hit or die"" vibe that I like, especially on the hardest difficulty where enemies deal high damage, and insta-kill weapons are a resource to manage. Even on the highest difficulty setting, enemies never turn into bullet sponges. You always have a weapon or combination of weapons that efficiently and satisfactorily kills a certain enemy quite well.

Despite the enjoyable gameplay, I find the level design to be labyrinthine and confusing. Even seemingly straightforward maps appear complicated due to their nonsensical design. The levels are made to position enemies in a way that allows players to either avoid or kill them from several angles. While this design has its merits, I found myself having to backtrack multiple times to figure out where I am supposed to go.

The rail section was really, really annoying. I got stuck because I was unaware that shooting the signs changed the direction (had to google that up). This section has a level design that consists of riding the train and facing intermittent ambushes. It becomes frustrating as every open space forces you to stop the train and clear the area before continuing, or risk an easy death. I was happy when this gameplay loop ended.

Another less enjoyable section is Xen. While I like its aesthetics (it really looks pretty alien), the gameplay mostly involves avoiding annoying enemies by bhopping. Unless you've saved a lot of ammo, you'll most likely look for scraps in hidden corners. As for the final boss, it's simple and boring. Fortunately, its attack pattern is easy to dodge, and the only concern is the green teleporting balls, but you can hide behind spikes/walls, that way you avoid teleportation.

Fast forward to the test chamber after I was running around like a maniac, I spent 10 or 20 minutes jumping around not knowing I had to climb up the ladder
After I pressed the button, I spent another 5 minutes wandering around until I pushed the cart
When the reactor started exploding, I went from being happy to being so scared that when I saw the Vortigaunts, I almost peed myself, I turned off my PC and went running to the bathroom

From what I understand it's one of those “most important games in the industry” but I don’t exactly see what aspects of it that revolutionised its genre.

The slippery controls took a real good while to get used to, especially considering I don’t really like using mouse and keyboard, but still tolerable for the most part. My biggest surprise was how narratively light it was being more so dressing in the background besides the long introduction at the start. Not that I mind, since the overall experience made the light narrative work well with essentially getting the player into the game as much as possible and just having the core gameplay of making mad dash through the lab as fun as it can be.

MY GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?

We've boosted the Anti-Mass Spectrometer to 105 percent. Bit of a gamble, but we need the extra resolution.

They're waiting for you, Gordon. In the Test Chamber.

Gordon doesn't need to hear all this. He's a highly trained professional. We have assured the Administrator that nothing will go wrong.

Gordon! Get away from the beams!

Shutting down. Attempting shut down. It's not...it's-it's not...it's not shutting down...it's not...

No, stay back! Gordon!

Take me with you, I'm the one man who knows everything!

Fire the...rocket engine. Destroy the damned thing before it grows any larger!

No...No! No! Get it off me! Get it off! Get it off!

This is my hiding spot, and I'm not moving until the situation is drastically improved. Now go away and don't tell anyone I'm here.

You're heading for the Lambda Complex, aren't you? I was heading there myself, until I wound up here and...well, simply lost my nerve. Take one look through that door and you'll see what I mean. I'm just going to wait out the catastrophe in here. If you intend to go on, then I beg of you...proceed with extreme caution.

This is the supply depot for our first survey team. Quite a few handsome specimens were collected from the borderworld and brought back this way—uhh, before the survey members started being collected themselves, that is. We suspect there is an immense portal over there, created by the intense concentration of a single powerful being. You will know it when you see it. I hate to say this, Gordon, but you must kill it, if you can.

All right, I can open the portal now. The process is complicated, and once it's begun I must not be interrupted or I will have to start all over again. Don't enter the beam until I give the okay, understood? I will begin.

Coming from everywhere.  This one had it all.  Even the G-Man figure.  Who was he?  What was his purpose here.  The graphics were super fantastic for old XP machines, took the puny graphics chips to their knees.
The story line of this one just pulls a player in.  I was there playing this 25 years ago on PC, and finishing up in December before STEAM pulls the plug on my Win 7 Alienware Rig.  Thanks Valve for the memories.

One thing I never mentioned originally is how I didnt like the soldiers because A:Hitscan and B:They kinda took away a good chunk of the aliens that I did like. The former kind of contributing to the slowness and boredom since it felt more like Call of Duty to me than I had expected. But since I expected it this time around I actually appreciate the fight they put up.

All in all, wayyyyy better than I initially thought, and I didnt even check what they updated for the anniversary so that could have improved it and I wouldnt have even noticed

The Nihilanth still was a pain in the ass, no changing that

(The old one)

This game aged worse than my grandfathers fertility, every inch of this game made me want to grab the revolver out of gordons fucking hand and blow my brains out with it. 

its slow, clunky, boring most of the time.

Half-Life is a game that came out in 1998 and was made by Valve. Completed the game on hard mode which was tough and challenging. This game goes beyond the ordinary, offering an immersive and groundbreaking experience, especially for its time.

The game has interesting weapons and a few puzzles that make you think. The levels are just right, with a mix of exploring, fighting, and figuring things out. Even though it's an old game, the graphics still look surprisingly good, especially for its time. 

The graphics, though aged, still hold their own, and the game's design is simply exceptional. It stands as a classic that continues to captivate players. It's not just a game; it's a gaming milestone. This is a game that offers an immersive experience and keeps players enthralled throughout. Half-Life is an incredibly intriguing game that has stood the test of time.

Being an old game, there are some obvious issues with it. The movement is a bit clunky at times, and there are points where something will randomly insta-kill you with no explanation, and I couldn't even tell you what it was after going back over it a dozen times. Some of the puzzles can get a bit tedious at times, since there is very little explanation. However, for a game made before the turn of the century, it is fantastic. The graphics look way better than they should for a game that preceded even Halo, the fighting is clean and fun, and the overall mechanics are years ahead of its time. Overall, despite getting annoyed with it at times, I stayed glued to my seat for five hours at a time.

Powered by the tweaked Quake engine, baptized as the GoldSrc engine, this marvel wasn't merely a game; it was the forge where Valve's future triumphs were hammered into existence.

This technological beast didn't just propel the narrative of Half-Life; it laid down the blueprints for gaming's tomorrow, with physics and AI that seemed to have a mind of its own. The GoldSrc engine didn't just raise the bar; it launched it into orbit.

Half-Life wasn't content with being just a game; it was a manifesto for storytelling and technology, reshaping the FPS genre and bulldozing through it, leaving a trail of innovation that echoes through the halls of game development. Valve wasn't just a company; it became a powerhouse, a force to be reckoned with.

November 19, 1998—mark it as a milestone, a celestial event in gaming's timeline. It wasn't just a release date; it was the birth of a legacy, an influence that still courses through the veins of game development, reminding us all that once upon a time, Half-Life changed the game.

### The Story of Half-Life

In the scientific chaos of Black Mesa, enter Gordon Freeman—not your average theoretical physicist but a one-man wrecking crew against interdimensional havoc. The experiment to open a portal to another dimension? Let's just say it didn't go as planned, unleashing a cosmic catastrophe that makes Monday mornings seem like a cakewalk.

No cutscenes here; the Half-Life saga unfolds in real-time chaos, immersing players in an unpredictable plot. Gordon battles aliens and military goons, all while the mysterious G-Man lurks in the shadows, overseeing like a cosmic supervisor with a questionable agenda.

As Gordon, you're not just surviving—you're thriving amidst government conspiracies and the aftermath of a scientific oopsie. The Black Ops join the party, and the story dives into the consequences of playing with portals. From underground labs to the alien abyss of Xen, Gordon's journey is a rollercoaster of survival, conspiracy, and the fallout of unchecked experiments.

And let's not forget our hero, Gordon Freeman—the silent protagonist with a PhD in kicking alien butt, facing the Nihilanth, the puppet master behind the invasion.

### The Weapons of Half-Life

In the chaotic dance of survival, Gordon Freeman wields a diverse arsenal in Half-Life, each weapon a symphony of destruction:

1. **Crowbar:** A symbol of resourcefulness, Gordon's trusty melee companion. When brains meet brawn, it's crowbar time.
2. **Glock 17:** The first firearm encountered, a reliable semi-auto lifeline in the struggle for survival. One squeeze, one less obstacle. Okay maybe more like two three or four or five.
3. **MP5 Submachine Gun:** With a grenade launcher in tow, this bad boy offers versatility in enemy dispatch. It's not just a gun; it's a statement.
4. **SPAS-12 Shotgun:** When things get up close and personal, the SPAS-12 delivers a symphony of devastation. Close quarters, meet firepower.
5. **Crossbow:** Silent, deadly, and perfect for those long-range rendezvous. A whisper in the dark, and enemies fall.
6. **Tau Cannon:** Experimental energy unleashed. When the Tau Cannon sings, enemies dance in its destructive melody.
7. **Gluon Gun:** Emitting a devastating energy beam, this experimental piece is the stuff of enemy nightmares. When subtlety isn't your style.
8. **Hivehand:** Alien sophistication at its finest. Homing organic projectiles, because regular ammo is too mainstream.
9. **Satchel Charges:** Deployable chaos. When a strategic touch of destruction is on the menu, satchel charges deliver.
10. **RPG:** When the going gets tough, the RPG gets going. Perfect for those adversaries who don't take a hint.
11. **Gauss Gun:** The game-changer. Launching high-velocity projectiles, it's the trump card in later stages. When you need to redefine the battlefield.

### The Enemies of Half-Life

1. **Headcrab:** Small terrors that latch onto your noggin, turning you into a puppet for their undead puppet show. Cute, right?
2. **Zombie:** The result of a Headcrab's twisted makeover—slow, relentless, and utterly unimpressed by your survival skills.
3. **Vortigaunt:** Alien shockers with a penchant for zapping your hopes and dreams. Hostile at first, but hey, they're just misunderstood, right?
4. **Houndeye:** Dog days are over. Now meet the dog-like aliens emitting sonic chaos because tranquility is overrated.
5. **Bullsquid:** Acid-spitting alien rage machines, proving that in the extraterrestrial beauty pageant, they win the ""Most Likely to Ruin Your Day"" category.
6. **Ichthyosaur:** Aquatic nightmares with a taste for human sushi. Enjoy the swim, just beware of the toothy welcome party.
7. **Black Ops:** Government's finest with a mission to cover up their mess. Advanced weaponry meets advanced levels of denial.
8. **Gargantua:** Massive, flame-throwing nightmares straight out of military daycare. Because nothing says ""containment"" like a walking inferno.
9. **Nihilanth:** The grand finale, an extradimensional overlord with a passion for invasion. Think of it as the alien maestro, conducting your demise.
10. **Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU):** Military might gone mad. Because when facing alien threats, you definitely want these guys on your side, right? (Spoiler: You don't.)

### Multiplayer

Half-Life Deathmatch, a side venture in the Half-Life universe, proved to be a surprise hit, injecting a competitive spark into the game's core. Developed alongside the single-player campaign, this mode flexed the game's mechanics in a player-versus-player showdown, seamlessly integrating the diverse arsenal from the solo journey into intense, fast-paced battles.

Sure, Deathmatch had its teething problems, with a few weapons hogging the spotlight more than others. Yet, despite the balancing act, it became a late '90s and mid-2000s sensation, birthing one of gaming's most devoted mapping communities. Players and modders crafted a plethora of custom maps, injecting longevity into the game and turning Deathmatch into a canvas of creativity.

What makes Half-Life Deathmatch endure isn't just the competition—it's the community. A legion of players and modders kept the flame alive, churning out custom content that turned multiplayer into a dynamic, ever-evolving experience. The legacy of Half-Life Deathmatch isn't just in the fragging; it's in the camaraderie, the dedication, and the endless creativity that breathed life into virtual battlefields for years.",1410706326,1701242310,True,3,0,0.566115736961364746,0,True,False,False

70,152490432,76561198000874702,683,80,529,0,529,1701041448,"Half Life is the best N64 game I've ever played. It has skeletons in its animation budget and bullet decals and ennemies that run around like they don't want to die. What a revolutionary title. But what's it about? Well, Half Life is about a regular guy working at a giant government complex in the middle of the desert, named Gordon Freeman. The place he works at is called Black Mesa and your mom is a hoe.

But then, you slam the space rock into the mega laser and time and space breaks loose. Everyone dies, there's blood everywhere. And transdimentional creatures are turning your coworkers into zombies. So you fight your way to the surface, hoping the military has a solution for this whole mess and you find out they do have a solution... Mass Scientific Genocide.
I feel like an idiot explaining the plot of a game like half life. It's so ingrained into gaming culture what half life was, what half life meant.  But, being that this is a review. I feel forced to lay down the basics, at least. Which is appropriate, because laying down the basics is exactly what Half Life does. While playing half life, without being told anything, you feel like you're being taught about the basics of game desing. 

And it's fair to say that its appraoch to narrative is still quite revolutionary. How many story rich games released in the past 10 years without cutscenes. Try naming one, I'll wait! Half life is special in that it offers one long unbroken narrative. Where you control the character at the begining of the story, and you don't stop doing so until the credits roll. It felt game changing at the time, and it's still impressive to this day.

Once, again, I feel like a dumbass explaining this shit. Like, if you haven't played half life, you're probably looking at this, not getting what makes it special. Because, from a modern lense, it just looks like any regular shooter. But, that's exactly what makes it special. The fact that it looks and feels like a standard game is mostly explained by the fact that modern gaming was built on the shoulders of it.

It elevated the bar so greatly that, 25 years later, it's still a rather fresh experience. It's weird that the default speed is running, and pressing shift makes you walk, but other than that,  Half Life very much manages to feel modern in a way few 90s games can. What most stands out is the heavy reliance on setpieces and scripted sequences. Characters talking to you and interacting with the environment. Half Life is so full of clever moments. You often feel like the devs are watching you play, thinking how best to mess with you this time.

There's flow and coherence to half life. Still, it's an old game and it can be pretty unfair and janky. The speed of the game can make it feel a bit slippery and the plot beyond its initial setup, is just a random set of NPCs telling why you're moving forward trough these linear corridors. But hey, Half Life is the grandfather of storytelling in action games. It's always been old, in a way. It made everyone realise just how early in the life of gaming we still live. If we don't all die of global warming within the next 20 years. We can always look back at half life, to try and understand what made the medium so special to begin with.

One thing that's weird is that 25 years later the game is still getting patches, fixing animation syncing issues like this scientist being grabbed by the Tentacule. You're probably surprised looking at this footage, because you've gotten so acclimated to it looking wrong but yeah. It took 25 years, but someone at valve fixed that. It's funny because the game is still really, really buggy and messy, in a lot of ways.

One issue I encountered is this event where you're forced to take damage. They try to counter that fact by placing medpacks there, but, as you can see. It's not fucking working. The problem is that the closest med station is literally 5 minutes and one flaming Tentacule spelunking expedition ago and I used it all up anyway. I was forced to reload to a manual save. Which I was lucky to have. Because, otherwise I would've had to redo the whole chapter. 

There's also this elevator that causes you to take damage, for some reason. Still, masterpiece masterpiece, this game is a masterpiece. So, maybe, from a modern lense, Half Life can seem pretty quaint. Some of the levels, like Xen and the waste processing plant, are just really bad. They're hard to navigate and they fail to feel like functional, real places. Still, even at its weakest, Half Life is still more creative than most games will allow themselves to be.

In short, Half Life is a golden example of brilliant game desing. It was made on dinosaurs by a bunch of quake modders helmed by two guys who used to work at microsoft and it rehinvented what it meant to make video games. It served as a guideline to what video games had to be from now on and, to this day, there is still a lot that could be learned from half life.

Its music is wonderfully atmospheric and it always manages to fit the mood perfectly. I honestly don't know what else to gush about. Half Life is just so goddamn wonderful.

I give half Life a flawed but beautiful 119 out of 124. Something this brilliant needs to be played to understand how to make games. Sentence that makes sense and concludes the video. Brain brain brain. I am a talking brain. I use my appendages to interact with the glyph device and the monolith formulates it into text on the display board. How magical is the whole human experience? The answer is not magical at all. Which is what makes it so magical to begin with.

This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa Research Facility personnel. The time is 8:47 A.M. Current topside temperature is 93 degrees with an estimated high of one hundred and five. The Black Mesa Compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times.
This train is inbound from Level 3 Dormitories to Sector C Test Labs and Control Facilities. If your intended destination is a high security area beyond Sector C, you will need to return to the Central Transit Hub in Area 9 and board a high security train. If you have not yet submitted your identity to the retinal clearance system, you must report to Black Mesa personnel for processing before you will be permitted into the high security branch of the transit system.
Due to the high toxicity of material routinely handled in the Black Mesa compound, no smoking, eating, or drinking are permitted within the Black Mesa Transit System. Please keep your limbs inside the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete halt at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instruction. If it is necessary to exit the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first. Please, stay away from electrified rails, and proceed to an emergency station until assistance arrives.
A reminder that the Black Mesa Hazard Course decathlon will commence this evening at 19:00 hours in the Level 3 facility. The semi-finals for high security personnel will be announced in a separate secure access transmission. Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your fitness.

I am playing through this again after the 25th Anniversary Update, and I have to say the game is so much better after it. Proper joystick support is amazing, and with the fixes for the UI at higher resolutions, this game is amazing on the Steam Deck. It could be just me, but the game seems to look far better too. Also, I have yet to encounter the bugs I did before, so my only gripe now would be that the endgame drags a bit. Easily 9/10, and absolutely worth the money.



Before 25th Anniversary Update:
I would give it a solid 7/10. Great story, great mechanics, and mostly still holds up in 2023. I say mostly, because there are several glitches that keep it from being perfect, the most prominent of which is when you run along a wall, you frequently lose all momentum. Also, in a later boss fight, the boss can get stuck where you cannot attack it, forcing you to reload frequently. That same boss fight has creatures that are so small they are almost invisible too. However, these are somewhat minor gripes about an awesome game!

You got rocket launchers, crazy made-up physics guns, secondary fire options that feel very cool when you know how to use them, and a story that is easy to understand and leads to a lot of potential rabbit holes. 

My only issue with games like these is I never know how difficult the game is supposed to be. I picked medium and the encounters feel quite fair most of the time. The problem is the game increasingly require more and more platforming of you as the levels go on. This is something the game does not excel at. The platforming feels exacting and unfun. I grew on up Nintendo platformers and find any puzzles or obstacles requiring jumping dexterity in the game to be a real drag. The final boss battle is marred for me because of this. When the game is focusing on FPS action and novelty, which is most of the time, that is when it shines. 

The puzzles that require navigation skills and not exact jumps are quite good. The weapons are thought out, and paced quite well. The music honestly pretty good when they have it.

Its varied weaponry and setting keeps exploration and combat fresh throughout the playthrough. Unique boss fights, friendly non-playable characters, and Metroidvania-esque backtracking set the gameplay apart from other early first-person shooters.

When compared to its progenitors, Half-Life was the first to deliver a strong narrative and scripted events that boosted immersion. This is a masterpiece of game design worthy of anyone's attention. And if that wasn't enough, Half-Life would later become the basis for various mods such as my all-time favorite game: Counter-Strike.


[h3] 25th Anniversary Update [/h3]
Seven maps, weapon balancing, and Steam networking revitalized the Deathmatch playerbase. Console commands are no longer required to fix widescreen FOV and to disable texture filtering. The original Quake-style view tilt, main menu art, and Valve intro are restored.

The HUD is now scaled with high resolutions, and low input latency is a welcome addition, especially for Counter-Strike. Increased engine limitations (and Counter-Strike func_vehicle) will allow map and mod creators to make amazing stuff. The last things I wish for are an internal resolution scaler, texture-animated water for OpenGL, and dynamic lighting à la Nightdive.",1690616308,1701150808,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

1.  Restore the blue light on the tip of the Gluon Gun's beam (I also heard that it and the Tau Cannon's particle color/general appearance has been changed, such as the secondary fire on the Tau Cannon not changing color when charged for a certain amount of time, but what do I know)

2.  Add a separate option in the menu for changing the size of the HUD, it could also have a recommended option for you to use too.

3.  Make the other games on the Goldsrc engine on Steam, you know, actually function???  (This will probably already be solved sooner than most people will notice, but you can't play Blue Shift, Opposing Force, Counter-Strike, etc)

And that's really it, the game now is essentially perfect, so good on you Valve!

Edit: You can actually play OP4, but it is a bit broken, here is at least a new suggestion at first edit, if not multiple by the time you are reading this.

Edit edit: I'm pretty sure all official and most non-official Goldsrc games are now fixed, yay! :]

4. Fix some Z-fighting, especially present on map c2a5c.

5. Sometimes when you pick up a tripmine (I noticed this when grabbing one in map c2a5d) the viewmodel will sometimes be broken for around a second after grabbing it, sometimes showing the tripmine but not your hands, and sometimes the tripmine viewmodel will just completely disapear.

6. The tentacle killing the scientist animation in Blast Pit is still broken, and it feels like it should have been fixed, but it's so iconic that I wouldn't mind much if it stayed.

6.5. (Well it seems like this is fixed too :])

7. Software mode might have some problems with it, maybe because of my computer idk, but for some reason you can't see your viewmodel unless you have default_fov set to 90.

8. Sound issues happened randomly one random time after opening the game, can only be fixed by setting _snd_mixahead to 0 or 0.1, (0.1 for me) very inconvenient.

9. It seems like randomized textures from the CD release are also not present.

But seriously, this update, this game, both are legendary, both are pieces of history.

Half-Life is a game that stands the test of time, and its presence on Steam is a testament to its enduring greatness. As soon as you become Gordon Freeman, you get immediately immersed in a world of seamlessly blended storytelling, innovative gameplay mechanics, and unmatched immersion. The narrative naturally unfolds as you navigate the Black Mesa Research Facility, unraveling a mysterious and captivating story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The absence of cutscenes enhances the immersive experience, allowing the player to stay fully engaged in the unfolding events. The attention to detail in the environmental storytelling is remarkable, making every corner of Black Mesa feel alive and consequential.

Gameplay-wise, Half-Life was groundbreaking in its time and continues to be a benchmark for the first-person shooter genre. The introduction of the HEV suit, with its iconic voice prompts, adds a layer of strategy to combat, and the arsenal of weapons is diverse and satisfying to use. The introduction of the gravity gun in later iterations only adds to the already stellar gameplay mechanics, providing a unique twist to the traditional FPS formula. What sets Half-Life apart is its commitment to innovation. The game introduces players to new concepts and challenges at a steady pace, keeping the experience fresh and exciting from start to finish. The level design strikes a perfect balance between challenging puzzles and intense firefights. The variety in environments, from the sterile labs to the eerie Xen dimension, showcases the developers' creativity and ability to craft a diverse and cohesive gaming experience.

The modding community surrounding Half-Life has also contributed to its longevity. With an overload of user-created content on Steam, the game continually evolves and offers new experiences to veteran players and those discovering it for the first time. In terms of visuals, while the graphics may not be cutting-edge by today's standards, the art direction has a timeless quality. The atmosphere created by the lighting, sound design, and environmental details still holds up, creating a mood that few games have been able to replicate. In conclusion, Half-Life is more than just a game; it's a milestone in the history of video games. Its influence gets felt in countless titles that followed, and its presence on Steam ensures that a new generation of gamers can experience the magic that captivated players when it was first released. If you haven't played Half-Life, it's not just a game; it's an essential piece of gaming history that deserves a place in every gamer's library.",1701107600,1701107600,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Impressive 'updates':
Those are the usual Valve updates (aka doing nothing at all (at most half-assed), or in general letting the community do all work)

-Adding 4 new multiplayer maps in game that has been dead for 25 years. Great, if they keep up this speed we will finally get updates for TF2 in only 11 years.
-I had to no-clip in the intro, cause the train and doors were out of sync. 
-Not only that, but all enemies have now removed blood and body parts.

But I'm sure that the 13 people who still play the game actively will appreciate the addition of 20 new sprays and

(this crying 12 year old (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199401321100) made me aware in the comments that I forgot to add, what I originally planned on adding. I came back to edit it, but then I remembered that Valve doesn't really care about their games, so why would I care about my reports. It stays unfinished like everything Valve does and promises)

Great work Valve. Please sell your platform (and IPs) finally to Microsoft, since you don't give a cr@p about your community. Instead of actually tackling problems where your community begs you for years now, you rather update this crap and make it worse.

The fact that Valve still wants money for their dead old games is truely amazing though.

Half-Life 1 was the first game in the series I got my hands on, and my favorite. Guess I'll start off with the obvious.

1. The Approach: Half-Life was unique to FPS games like DooM, Quake, and the Build Engine trilogy at the time. It took time at the start of its campaign to build the characters and the feel of Black Mesa. 
Taking two chapters (Black Mesa Inbound and Anomalous Materials.) To focus on character development, and getting the player into the world that Valve had set up for them. Like watching scientists in the distance run around, getting their work done in the iconic train ride.

2. The Gameplay: Valve wanted the player to feel like they were trapped in a scenario they couldn't control. Like they were just some guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hence why the first Headcrab you encounter is so early you don't even have the Crowbar yet.
Ahh, the Crowbar, the only melee weapon you get throughout Gordon's entire adventure through Black Mesa. This was to enhance that feeling of 'Shit's hit the fan, time to get outta here.'
Moreover, the player's health caps at 100, no higher, no lower. Again, you're not a super-soldier, just a scientist trying to survive.
And most notably at the time. Fall Damage and Reloading. Quake went full 3D. Half-Life went full realism. Reloading was such a novelty at the time, I can think of one other game that had reloading for all of its guns. Marathon.
Fall damage was also a rare thing. The Build Engine had it, but it was negligible. In Half Life, a full 3D game unlike the Build Trilogy, had fall damage make its presence known. Take Blast Pit for example. The map's mostly vertical, and you can't jump from the top floor to the bottom without tanking some large damage. Or right after that chapter in Power Up. There's a pipe before meeting the Gargantuan that can't be lived through on low health, unless the player lands on the table with the medkits.

3. The Story: You should know it by now. You are Gordon Freeman, a Theoretical Physicist working for Black Mesa. A top secret research facility in the middle of the desert in New Mexico.
One fateful day, after being late for work, Gordon begins the usual experiment using an Anti-Mass Spectrometer and a crystal specimen from Xen, the border world. But things go wrong, causing a Resonance Cascade, ripping open a portal to Xen, allowing alien creatures to spill through.
Gordon survives the Cascade itself and fights his way through the facility. Going toe to toe with both the Xen forces, and the HECU, a highly trained group of soldiers sent to kill everyone to cover up Black Mesa's existence.
Gordon finally reaches the Lambda labs, and is sent to Xen by the surviving members of the Science Team there, and slays the Nihlanth, the being holding the portal between Xen and Earth open.
Afterwards, he has an encounter with the G-Man. Whom he had been seeing since his train ride to work when this whole mess started.
Being sent to a recreation of said train. The G-Man offers Gordon a job under his employers. Gordon accepts and is sent into stasis until the events of the second game.
This approach at story through the eyes of someone in the middle of the event was something the gaming idustry had never seen before. Usually it was reading the game's manual, or through on-screen text that lore was presented.
But Valve changed that, and made the game that would shape the way FPS games were done to this very day.

That was a wall of text, but long story short, Buy Half-Life if you haven't already. It's a great game, Immersive and fun, a great experience overall. It has its negatives, (what game doesn't?) But those negatives are outweighed by the positives. Now, ""Have a safe, and productive day.""

These days this is common in FPS games, but when the game came out it was ground breaking.

The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo radioactive decay or how long stable atoms survive. The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential (or, rarely, non-exponential) decay. For example, the medical sciences refer to the biological half-life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body. The converse of half-life (in exponential growth) is doubling time.

The original term, half-life period, dating to Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the principle in 1907, was shortened to half-life in the early 1950s.[1] Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element's half-life in studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206.

Half-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity, and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation.

The game follows the story of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a scientist who must escape the Black Mesa Research Facility after a physics experiment gone wrong unleashes an alien invasion. The game combines action, puzzle-solving, and storytelling in a seamless way, using scripted sequences instead of cutscenes to advance the plot. The game also features a multiplayer mode that allows the player to compete against friends and enemies around the world.

Half-Life is widely regarded as one of the best and most influential games ever made, winning over 50 PC “Game of the Year” awards and selling more than nine million copies by 20081. The game was praised for its graphics, gameplay, and narrative, which set a new standard for FPS games. The game also spawned a successful franchise, including several expansion packs, sequels, mods, and a remake. Half-Life is a game that every FPS fan should play, as it offers a thrilling and unforgettable experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

You could plug this formula into any type of game, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, military, crime, etc... and you would be off to a great start. The game is a master-class in game design, and is a far better game than it's sequel.

This game is like a roller-coaster ride through a dystopian world, where you're constantly running from aliens, zombies, and probably your own sanity. It's the perfect blend of heart-pounding action and mind-bending puzzles that will leave you scratching your head and wondering if you missed a PhD in theoretical physics along the way.

The graphics may not be cutting-edge by today's standards, but hey, it's like a fine wine that gets better with age. And let's not forget the iconic crowbar, the ultimate tool for both home improvement and alien extermination. Who needs a plumber when you have a trusty crowbar, right?

But let's talk about the real star of the show: Gordon Freeman, the silent hero who communicates through head nods and crowbar swings. He's like the James Bond of the scientific world, except instead of fancy gadgets, he relies on his wits and a seemingly endless supply of ammo hidden in his pockets. Seriously, where does he keep all that stuff?

Now, I must warn you, Half-Life has a reputation for leaving players hanging. It's been 25 years, and we're still waiting for that elusive third instalment. It's like the gaming equivalent of waiting for a unicorn to show up at your doorstep. But hey, who needs closure when you can replay the first two games over and over again, right?

So, if you're looking for a game that will make you question reality, make you jump out of your seat, and make you wonder why you didn't pursue a career in theoretical physics, then Half-Life is the game for you.

From a graphical standpoint, this game is nothing special. (The rock texture makes my eyes hurt.) However, you can turn off texture smoothing in OpenGL mode with the new update, giving the textures a pixelated charm that I really like. The software render would be my go-to for playing this game, except for the fact that the weapon models don't show up. Huh.

Half-Life has what we today would consider a pretty standard story. You play as a scientist named Gordon Freeman (whom I have no doubt you've heard of before). He goes to work at a Texas-based science facility called Black Mesa, and is running a little late. He uses his gift of sprinting at ninety miles an hour (not part of the canon, but still in the game for some reason) to put on his fancy orange jumpsuit before heading over to the test chamber. Orange jumpsuit... test chamber... huh. Guess this game really was influential. Anyway, the crystal blows up when Gordon blasts it with a laser, and he uses his arsenal of high-tech weaponry such as crowbars and crossbows to make it out of the facility.

[spoiler] The military is sent in to contain the situation by killing everyone, so Gordon steals their machine guns to blast his way through them. Eventually, he makes it to the Lambda Complex and is told that the alien portal that was opened when the crystal blew up is being kept open by someone in Xen, the borderworld. A Lambda scientist gives Gordon a really nice space laser of death, and another one gives him a fancy jetpack that lets him jump far. The scientists send him on his way to Xen - the most hated part of this game. Gordon jumps through Xen, blowing up an alien spider mama's abdomen, until he makes it to the lair of the Nihilanth, the giant demon baby that wants to control Earth or something. Gordon blows up his head, and then gets offered a job by a creep known as Gman. (Ever watched Skibidi Toilet? You know who you are. And who he is - sort of.) Canon says that Gordon takes the job, but in your playthrough, you can choose to reject the job offer and get thrust into a field of Alien Grunts, defenseless against them because Gman took your weapons. [/spoiler] Like I said, it may seem standard, but back then, most PC gamers were depicted as nerds. They wanted a nerdy protagonist who needed to become the action hero, rather than pulling another Doom. Sure, System Shock did something like this, but that game had terrible sales. (Buy the System Shock remake btw.) This kind of story was revolutionary back then.

Now for the gameplay. It's pretty dang great. There are puzzles, and the combat is really well designed - you will never, EVER feel like a specific weapon is rusting. The crowbar is good for taking out really close headcrabs if you don't wanna waste ammo, and also for crushing crates - again, if you don't wanna waste ammo. The machine gun has plentiful ammo in the game's second act, and the crossbow is real nice because it is way overpowered and can shoot underwater (not to mention the scope it comes with!) However, it is really slow to shoot, and REALLY slow to reload, giving you an incentive to use the revolver aboveground - it can one-shot most enemies, but ammo's really rare. The hivehand generates its own ammo, and the gluon gun is just hilariously overpowered (but uranium 238 is quite rare). The tau cannon is really strong, but uses the same ammo as the gluon gun, which is stronger.

The game's levels are really well crafted, and they feel so tightly packed and full of secrets. (In development, Gabe Newell told the development staff to never have a dull moment in the game - if someone shoots the wall, they don't want to feel like said wall is ignoring them.) Xen really wasn't so bad - just repetitive. (Wish Half-Life Source had redesigned it with Source's better handling of outdoor areas, but hey, Black Mesa got it down.) [spoiler] The demon baby was defeated easily by me without using any energy weapons or even getting teleported anywhere. [/spoiler]

All in all - you know you have ten bucks lying around. What better use is there - Half-Life 2? Portal? Well, maybe, but still. You probably already have Portal, anyway.",1700633561,1700929731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although the game may feel a bit dated today, it's still a great time that genuinely still feels fresh over 25 years later. Plus it's at an incredible price point (10$ normally, and I snagged it for 99 cents on sale) so there's not really a reason to not have played it by now.

STORY: 6/10

You know what Half-Life is. You don't need me to tell you what Half-Life is. You shoot stuff, you escape the Black Mesa Foundation, and you see some pretty freaky things in the process. What you might need me to tell you is that Half-Life is still very deserving of your time, even if it's ancient.

For how old the game is, it still controls incredibly well. It's no surprise that a lot of the best modern shooters were built on Source (take both TF2s, for instance). The engine feels good, even in its early days. Everything feels incredibly responsive and fast, meaning that fighting is fun, simple as that. There's a large variety of weapons, environments, and enemies to keep you on your toes, evolving with your arsenal throughout the course of the game.

Outside of primary combat, some of the cracks begin to show. HL's movement felt very slippery to me, which  combined with platforming to lead to at least one frustrating experience. I don't think I knew how much platforming and puzzle solving there was in HL - it's not a ton, but it's definitely more than I would have thought before playing the game. There's a lot of variety, and the game definitely rewards you for paying attention to the environment and thinking outside of the box.

The level design is another highlight of HL: each stage presents it's own unique set of challenges and gimmicks. From the dingy vents and ruins of the Materials Lab to the military action on the surface, there's something new at every turn. Levels are tight, without too much stuff to sidetrack you with, although that didn't stop me from getting lost a few times. The design was strong, but there were definitely aspects that felt outdated.

Speaking of outdated, there are definitely quite a few things that will remind you that this game is 25 years old. The barebones settings, the low-poly graphics, and simplistic AI are all telltale signs of the era of this game. That's not really a fault against the game, they don't really get in the way of a good time at all, but it is something that you WILL notice. There are a lot of modern fixes to these problems, I'm sure, but I feel that the old graphics hold up quite well and the barebones settings weren't ever problematic (although they did lead to me basically turning down the music for the entire game to manage audio balance).

Something dated that was a bit more problematic was the game design. A lot of HL's game design is brilliant, setting a high bar for games to come after. Other parts of HL's game design feel like they come straight from the 90s. I could get lost and I wouldn't know if I was just being stupid or the game was just being archaic. Thankfully, it's not too hard to figure out how to fix these issues, but I would be lying if I said they weren't a problem at all. A minor nitpick, but still. These minor frustrations really stymied a lot of my enjoyment, and led to me getting really frustrated over nothing. Highlights include thinking a door was blocking a path leading to me taking about 40 minutes to try to find an alternate path before realizing I could just interact with the door. It happens.

At the end of the day, Half-Life is considered a masterpiece for a reason, and the internet doesn't need another essay about why it rocks. The game does feel old, but it also feels good. It was fun, and it had me glued to my screen. Give it a try! It's good to get back to the roots, after all.",1700892300,1700892300,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Any ""modern shooter"" fan simply needs to play this. Every aspect of an FPS game was probably inspired by Half-Life, whether directly or indirectly. The experimental psychology approach that Valve was successful from the start, precisely because what was to us their start was to them the culmination of countless iterations upon which they improved their game, making it the tight experience it will always be.

My only criticism is a personal one, which is that I am disappointed there is no way to remove the 500 velocity limit without using a potentially now-unusable mod like OpenAG. Almost every other issue I would have had has been fixed with the 25th anniversary update, which has brought back many features previously lost to time. If I had to request for something to be back, it would be bringing something to replace what A3D and EAX brought in the non-steam version.

The milestone motivated me to finally finish this original version for myself (I finished Black Mesa before this), and as much as I enjoyed this game, I also have some pretty mixed feelings that make me wish reviews on Steam weren't a simple yes or no.  I decided to recommend this game in the end, but this game has a LOT of flaws that are more apparent 25 years later.  Very important to note, I played on normal for this review.

For an FPS game originally released in 1998, this game was (and still is) super impressive, in both gameplay and now iconic graphics.  You acquire a pretty big arsenal throughout the game, and I did find uses for all of the weapons.  Unfortunately, the subject of combat is where my opinions start to become mixed.  It was around the fifth chapter that things started to go downhill for me, which just happens to be the chapter where the military enemies are introduced, but also other enemies introduced after.

The entire middle of the game from that point on is just the worst.  Enemies, human or alien, can take AND deal a ton of punishment, and you can't deal as much of it as you thought, which makes what initially felt like a plentiful 200 max health for you feel like you could die in about 3 seconds.  It also doesn't help that there are regular surprise moments with enemies behind corners or otherwise out of view that killed me SO MANY TIMES.  The game also becomes cheap with resources around this point, so don't be surprised if you're regularly under 10 health with not enough ammo for your good weapons and have to quick save just to get through (LOOKING AT YOU SURFACE TENSION).

On top of that, the game has a lot more moments of platforming and puzzle solving.  The puzzles can be a pain sometimes if you miss a small button or something somewhere and spend an obnoxious amount of time trying to find it, but they're usually fine as long as you're paying attention to your surroundings.  However, the platforming is AWFUL.  Gordon's speed and momentum makes it feel like he's constantly on ice.  This isn't a problem in combat situations (that speed can even be helpful), but the platforming moments definitely caused the most amount of deaths for me because of the controls being combined with constant do or die situations.

Fortunately, the game starts to pick up again near the end.  After surface tension, the puzzles and combat become more forgiving (largely due to the weapons you receive at this point, as well as having minimal military enemies and traps to deal with), resources become common enough so that you aren't constantly in critical condition, and platforming takes a MASSIVE backseat.  The last few chapters in Xen have some mild platforming, but it's actually manageable with the long jump (provided you can get the hang of it.), and the combat definitely doesn't ask for too much if you've managed to make it this far.

By the end, I enjoyed my playthrough of Half Life.  If you can get through the middle of it, the beginning and the end are great, and you can see how revolutionary this game must've been back in 1998.  However, with Black Mesa existing and being the superior version of this game, I would honestly just play that unless you want a nostalgia trip.  And if you DO want to play this version, play on easy if you don't want to rip your hair out (at least in terms of combat) during the midgame.",1700879901,1700879901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I cant post a bug report because I don't have steam guard, so Ill just post it here:
- Gets stuck in geometry a lot, especially when trying to leave the water in the final boss battle
- Enemies also get stuck in the walls sometimes, I don't remember this ever happening before the latest update, but I haven't played it that much.
- The headcrab mother boss, gets stuck in the tunnel before the final room of its boss battle, which can really get you stuck, since its immortal until it reaches the room, and it has to die before you can continue from that room.
- The blue laser from mines sometimes get reflected off walls in a way it shouldn't and this reflected part of the laser doesn't disappear when the mine blows up, leaving a blue laser beam coming out the wall which does nothing.

Thats all I remember off the top my head. But I several times had to load a much earlier save because of a stupid bug getting me completely stuck, so safe often and dont use quicksave which overwrites!

GoldSrc Half Life is a great game, a complete game, and the worthy version of classic Half Life 1 in comparison to HL: Source.

In my entire playthrough I ran into 0 bugs, other than those damn HECU soldiers who can somehow take half a clip and keep moving.

GoldSrc is to Source what CS 1.6 is to CS: Source, so if you prefer one over the other, you have the liberty to choose.

Released in 1998, Half-Life stands as an enduring testament to innovation in the world of video games. Two and a half decades later, its influence remains palpable, and its gameplay, narrative, and design continue to captivate players. As a pioneer of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre, Half-Life's groundbreaking contributions have left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape.

At its core, Half-Life revolutionized storytelling in video games. Unlike its contemporaries, the game immersed players in a narrative that unfolded seamlessly within the game world. The absence of cutscenes and the use of a first-person perspective allowed for an unprecedented level of player agency, creating an immersive experience that felt more like a living, breathing world than a scripted sequence of events. The mysterious and atmospheric Black Mesa Research Facility served as the perfect backdrop for the unfolding chaos, keeping players engaged and invested in the unfolding plot.

The innovative use of scripted sequences and in-game events was a hallmark of Half-Life's design. From the iconic [spoiler]resonance cascade that sets the story in motion to the unpredictable encounters with the enigmatic G-Man[/spoiler], the game's dynamic events created a sense of unpredictability and urgency, establishing a blueprint that many subsequent titles would follow. This commitment to environmental storytelling added layers of depth and nuance, making the game's world feel rich and alive.

One of Half-Life's most enduring legacies is its introduction of the HEV suit-wearing protagonist, Gordon Freeman. Silent and unassuming, Freeman became a symbol of player immersion, as gamers projected themselves onto the scientist thrust into a nightmare. The absence of cutscenes meant that every revelation and twist occurred in real-time, heightening the emotional impact and ensuring that players were an integral part of the unfolding narrative.

Beyond its narrative innovations, Half-Life set new standards for level design and interactivity. The game featured a seamless world without loading screens, creating a sense of continuity rarely seen at the time. Puzzles were integrated into the environment, encouraging players to think critically and explore their surroundings. 

The longevity of Half-Life's influence is also evident in the modding community it spawned. Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, and Team Fortress all originated as Half-Life mods, showcasing the game's versatility and providing a platform for creative expression that continues to this day.

In the realm of graphics and audio, Half-Life may show its age, but the art direction and sound design remain timeless. The eerie resonance of the headcrab's screech and the industrial hum of the Black Mesa facility contribute to an atmosphere that is both haunting and unforgettable.

In conclusion, Half-Life's legacy is firmly rooted in its groundbreaking innovations that not only shaped the FPS genre but also influenced the broader gaming landscape. Its commitment to player agency, environmental storytelling, and seamless world design set a standard that few games have surpassed. Whether revisiting it for a nostalgic trip down memory lane or experiencing it for the first time, Half-Life's impact is undeniable, and its status as a timeless masterpiece is well-deserved.",1700764429,1700764429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Cant click on Options tab, causes it to crash to desktop
2. When in game and your on the Tram ride, there is a part where a bulk head opens to let you and the tram pass through. Sadly it doesn't open but the Tram still goes through, pinning your character to the back of the Tram... game over.

I had tried Doom, Quake, Unreal and Duke Nukem 3D, but Half-Life felt it had something new, something that combined all those previously mentioned games in it's own unique way. 
Later friend got the full game  (this was before Steam existed so it was released by Sierra) and we were so impressed how the story was seamlessly integrated to game play and how all the cutscenes happened inside the game engine. The game was so interesting that we played it many hours in to midnight and continued next day and the next,  probably continuing to play the game over the week, only stopping while going to school or sleeping. Btw. That was back in 1998 and we were teenagers.
Soon I discovered all the cool single player mods (They Hunger was my fave) and the famous team based online mod called ""Counter Strike"". Those were the days...
Later I also played the PlayStation 2 version of HL and that was it's own experience with all of it's enchantments for graphics that later found their way to Steam version, but I always felt that the original models belong to PC version. 

It's really great that Valve still shows love for the  game that made them famous. The current 25th Anniversary Edition with restored old-school look with full Steam Deck compatibility truly is the definitive edition of HL. 

My Steam game time may  not look like a lot, but I have original pre-Steam physical versions of the game for PS2 and PC so I have basically played Half-Life most of my life :D

[b]Uplinked[/b]. Adds a level that is inspired by HL: Uplink demo. The author is very creative and the level starts seamlessly after Surface Tension. It has new puzzles but no new monsters or weapons which makes it seem like another HL chapter. My only real gripe with this mod is that it is completely unintuitive at times. Loader section requires to fix a bridge by putting down a crate and then go to another room with it. Overall, I can easily recommend it. It works on Linux too.
[b]Echoes[/b]. Best mod of 2018. Always worth playing. Too bad I'm getting softlocked near the end of the game.

The story was amazing, the soundtrack, and the gameplay! This is just awesome.
My only complaint about it is that it doesn't tell you where to go most of the time, So you'll have to look up a walkthrough, which can be annoying.
If you previously played Half-Life 2 before Half-Life 1, please try Black Mesa if you want the same kind of experience with Half-Life 2. It's pretty amazing for a remake!

I recommend this game and is a must have if you're into shooters.

Released in 1998, Half-Life 1 set the bar for immersive storytelling, innovative gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals in the industry.

The game follows the story of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a brilliant physicist who finds himself in the middle of a catastrophic event at the Black Mesa Research Facility. As the facility collapses around him, Freeman is forced to navigate through the ruins and uncover the truth behind the chaos. The game's captivating narrative, combined with its engaging gameplay mechanics, will keep players hooked from start to finish.

One of the most impressive aspects of Half-Life 1 is its physics engine, which was groundbreaking at the time of its release. The game's physics system allows for objects to be manipulated in a realistic and intuitive way, adding an extra layer of immersion to the gameplay. From moving crates to launching yourself off a ramp, the physics system in Half-Life 1 is both fun and satisfying.

The game's graphics, while dated by today's standards, still hold up remarkably well. The environments are detailed and atmospheric, with a variety of locations ranging from the ruins of the Black Mesa Research Facility to the depths of an underground laboratory. The game's sound design is also noteworthy, with immersive sound effects and a hauntingly memorable soundtrack.

In terms of gameplay mechanics, Half-Life 1 strikes a perfect balance between action and strategy. Players will need to use their wits and resources to overcome obstacles and enemies, with a variety of weapons and tools at their disposal. The game's enemies are also diverse and challenging, requiring players to adapt their strategies to each encounter.

In conclusion, Half-Life 1 is a must-play for anyone who loves first-person shooters or classic games. Its innovative physics engine, immersive storytelling, and engaging gameplay mechanics make it a true classic that still holds up today. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or a newcomer to the genre, Half-Life 1 is a game that you won't want to miss.",1511634287,1700694950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

so i Bought it, & in the first 10 minutEs playiNg the gamE, i couldn't leave it & i Was blown away by it's aspEcts, such as: well created environment & well crafted environmentaL storytelling, the originaLity & unique gameplay & interactivity, & most of all - the fact that a 25 years old game could be so great in present day, half-life Aged like an old wine, it was a big surprise.
after playing botH half-life & doom, i can tell that half life tAkes doom by far, (doom is great too don't get me wrong) & i personally think that there's not even one bit of half-life that is less than perfect.
it's aLso more Forgiving than doom, so it's easier for newcomers to handLe it. ( & if you're an oldcomer & you thInk the game is too easy even on hard level, there's a mod call ""hard-life"" [which i think is a genious name] that as the name suggests, is half-life, but harder)
half-life is my Favorite game, (to make it clearly, i've played: horizon: zEro dawn, uncharted 4 & spider-man miles morales) i give it 10\10, 100\100, 3\3, if i could i'd give it a higher score because i think it's an exceptional among other masterpieces, i think it's an exceptional masterpiece.",1700664584,1700664584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're a physicist who has never fired a gun in his life. Reflexes will only do you so much good without the wits to back it up. Your goal isn't to shoot everything in sight, it's to survive the worst ordeal of your life.

A pensive, methodical slow burn of a game with a brilliant yet understated narrative to boot. Don't think for a second you're in for any lulls of gameplay with ham-fisted cutscenes, spoon-fed exposition, or walls of text. Not a chance. The gameplay is the story. You are on your own.  What matters is how closely you decide to examine it.

If you love subtle and cerebral storytelling combined with clever and intense action with only your wits and reflexes to protect you, you absolutely need to get this game. Few titles out there have the care and quality this 25+ year old title has. Incredible mechanical design, phenomenal atmosphere and pacing, fantastic narrative structure and presentation, absolutely superb level design, unsurpassed cohesion, and boundless ambition went into making this an enduring classic that aged like a fine wine and combines wonderfully throughout as a single body. Highest recommendation to a game I can give.

If you've even once thought in passing this game might be good, say no more, and get it while it's on sale. Go in completely blind if you can. But enough dilly-dallying. You have a job to do.",1379637389,1700662406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

He has the extremely common and mundane ability to carry multiple weapons in his . He can retrieve anything stored in his  with relative ease, but for some reason he stacks them together based on weapon category. You have to push the same key multiple times to reach most weapons after you find them. Weird, but lots of variety.

What's most interesting to me is how well ladders actually work in this game. I mean, it's a video game, and it's old. Yet somehow, once you figure out that looking up makes you climb up, and down for down, and walking is the best way to approach one from the top, it actually has an impressive ladder mechanic for such an old game. I'm surprised I even noticed this. On the other hand, moving on flat ground is like trying to force a cat into a wet sink. They got ladders right, but walking was too hard apparently. Still, like Super Metroid and ledge-grabbing, nobody has ever gotten ladders to work this well since. Fight me.

I don't know why, but this is usually where people put undue hostility after a hot take.

Bitch.

Worth it for the novelty, but probably not very replayable after you realize the majority if this game is spent sliding on flat surfaces. 7/10. Needs more ladders.",1700656437,1700657566,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

During an experiment gone wrong, where you're the one that pushed the crystal into the analyzer, you're the only hope of the survivors to reach the search and rescue team, because of your combinaison. However, you'll have to survive from the attacks of your coworkers transformed in zombies and creatures coming from another world. And unfortunately for you, your only weapon is a crowbar. And you're just a scientist employed by Black Mesa...

That's Half-Life for you. A scientist relying on a crowbar first before becoming an expert in weapons. The story is perhaps basic and with some twists but noneless, the universe build around Half-Life has expanded a lot.

However, if Half-Life is a FPS, which means weapons to shoot any enemies, that you can carry thanks to your wonderful combinaison, you can find some puzzles throughout the game, mainly because of the need to wander around a destroyed facility.

What's fascinating in Half-Life isn't probably the gameplay in itself. I mean, everything seems very basic. But if it wasn't for it, you wouldn't have mods like Counter-Strike around. I don't know why I was fascinated by Half-Life. I mean, it's not like jumping was new or that weapons were innovative... maybe the iconic crowbar has to do something with. Or maybe it's just that a plot, perhaps basic but very effective, the mysterious G-Man following you around and disappearing easily or that the fact it's someone that wasn't trained to become the hero of the world... or maybe the ending. I don't know but I just know that when I played it, I was fascinated.

I was fascinated by the fact that you can find survivors around that can help you, guards or scientists. Or the fact that some of them meet a tragic fate under your eyes. I was fascinated by the change of the objectives: from reaching the surface, you're now the only hope to end an invasion and the wiping of any survivor by the soldiers.

I don't remember any problem with the gameplay apart the treacherous ladders. Climbing them isn't hard. However, when you needed to step out of them OR going down, it was a challenge. And the famous jumping with the crates where you were sliding...

Half-Life has the graphics from 1998 and it was very good ones. Even now, I could still enjoy them. I don't say that it's detailed. But you can see some interesting details. And Xen, the other world, despite being a challenge, is very beautiful.

Besides, the soundtrack is also great. It's only heard during some important moments. But the music is powerful.

Valve really shocked me with this update. I never thought that i will ever see something like this. They not only fixed some old issues but also gave us new old content (like demo campaign - Uplink, player models and maps from demos). Main menu now looks like from retail version, which is very nostalgic for me. Also UI is now auto-scalable and now it's big enough to see text on 2K and 4K screen, which is great. But please valve, add UI scale setting, i really liked how it looked before at 1080p.

From the moment players step into the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a scientist caught in a scientific disaster at the Black Mesa Research Facility, the immersive experience begins. What sets Half-Life apart is its commitment to uninterrupted gameplay; there are no cutscenes, and the narrative unfolds seamlessly through the player's perspective. This design choice, coupled with a gripping storyline and atmospheric setting, creates a sense of tension and curiosity that keeps you glued to the screen.

The gameplay is a perfect blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense combat. Armed with an iconic crowbar and an array of inventive weapons, players face off against both human and extraterrestrial foes. The level design is exceptional, offering a challenging and varied experience that keeps you on your toes.

Graphically, Half-Life was a pioneer in its time. While the visuals may appear dated by today's standards, they were revolutionary in 1998, showcasing detailed environments, realistic character models, and atmospheric lighting. The game's use of the GoldSrc engine laid the foundation for future advancements in gaming technology.

Half-Life's impact goes beyond its technical achievements; it has become a cultural touchstone for gamers. The modding community has flourished around it, creating a wealth of user-generated content that adds to the game's replayability. The legacy of Half-Life is evident in the continued popularity of the franchise and its influence on subsequent generations of game developers.

In summary, Half-Life 1 is a timeless gem that deserves a place in every gamer's library. Its innovative design, gripping narrative, and pioneering technology have secured its status as a classic that continues to be enjoyed by both nostalgic veterans and a new generation of players. If you haven't experienced the origin of the Half-Life saga, it's a journey well worth taking",1586456387,1700645839,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing it today however- well, I wouldn't say it's aged badly, but there's just better things to spend your time on. It's still got its moments, but things have moved on so far that I find it impossible to get into properly. 

If you missed it the first time round, you won't have nostalgia to smooth over all the glaring wrinkles. I'd suggest playing Half-Life 2 and the Episodes instead, which are as fresh today as they were when they were released.

I also actually liked playing HL1 more than HL2, but that seems to be an unpopular opinion.

+The game is challenging you won't be able to beat this game easily in Short It's not your average run and shoot game instead of hunting down waves after waves of enemies there are a lot of puzzles in the game you have to solve in order to proceed to next level only intelligent people are able to do so (Seriously)
+Great soundtracks
+Physics is perfect (almost)
+Maps are very detailed (for a game developed in GoldSrc Engine)
+Variety of weapons (about 13-15)
+Hard to beat enemies
+Great Environment (The feeling of being alone and surrounded by enemies from all sides)
+Multiplayer (Deathmatch)
+Mods Support

Cons:
-Few minor Bugs (But the game is still playable)
-No Half-Life 3 :l

+ First FPS game to fully incorporate a Narrative-Driven story (as opposed to the industry standard of maze gallery shooters which was the Wolfenstein 3D / Doom mechanic).
- Perpetual sprint with optional walking by pressing “Shift” (as opposed to today's standard which is the reverse).
+ Excellent level designs.
+ Realistic combat mechanics (may be not as realistic now, but in 1998, it was).
- Melee weapon needs to be equipped rather than bound to a hotkey (though CS:GO players won't have a problem with this).
+ Fun puzzles.
- No objective tracker (players may forget what they were doing especially if they haven't played in a while).
+ Great sound effects.
+ First FPS game to incorporate scripted sequences for its level transitions rather than cut-scenes.
+ Relatively (and surprisingly) advanced AI (back in 1998), with enemies actively dodging, tactically retreating and often times baiting you into an ambush (literally, there is a point in the game where you get knocked out).
+ Fun fast-paced multiplayer action that set the foundations for Counter-Strike which started as a just a mere mod of Half-Life.
+ Mods; although Half-Life is not the first video game to be modded, it is the first to have several such mods become their own full games that still retain their Half-Life heritage.
+ Challenging difficulty modes (but this is a given since most old-school shooters were challenging).

Back in 1998 this was Valve's first retail product and in November of 2023 Valve updated the game for it's 25th anniversary which added some ""lost content"" and updated some graphics settings, updated controller and networking support, adding official support for play on the Steam Deck, among incorporating various fixes and other content.  This version of the game, now 25 years old, is considered by Valve to be the definitive version which they say they will continue to support and update as time goes on, so it truly deserves the ""Labor of Love Award"".

There's a good reason why this game is getting special treatment all these years later.  ""Half-Life"" is more than just a mere shooter; puzzles and storytelling are equally important parts to the game.  These concepts carry throughout the whole series.  This game was instantly recognized for the high quality graphics, gameplay, and narrative.  25 years ago the sci-fi setting made this game stand out from many shooting games.  There are some really creative puzzles and unique enemies and creatures in this game.  The weapons also are cool, the script is interesting, and majority of the levels are well done.  All these years later I honestly still dread the water level, though!

Everything about this game was just different when it came out compared to traditional shooters.  Even the enemies behaved differently than they did in most other games from the same time.  I'd like to think that most of the things that were unique back then still sets it apart from shooters today.  Even if you did not get the game for free during the 25th anniversary weekend giveaway, this game frequently goes on sale for 90% off so it's definitely worth playing through to see how revolutionary this game is.

Half-Life really sells immersion and great gunplay instead of making you feel like a powerhouse, the game makes you think. Half-Life isn't played in the style of Doom where you shoot everything that moves and you're always in control. Half-Life is about using your brain to navigate situations. The Half-Life series was on a sale, and Half-Life was free. Still, get the game!





My old review does not give justice to this masterpiece of a game. Half-Life truly is one of THE games of all time. Whenever you complete Half-Life, it's like getting a Pokemon gym badge for completing this game. I say that because Half-Life is one of the major icons for gaming along with titles like Dark Souls, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil (Resident Evil 4 specifically), etc. Let me remind you that Half-Life was made during 1998, 25 years ago. 25 years ago, immersion in 3D video games was not able to be sold with realistic models. The time that Half-Life was made was whenever the video game models and textures were made up of about 5 or 6 polygons. So, the way that game developers would have to sell immersion in games like Half-Life or Ocarina of Time would have to be interactable and cause and effect environments, if that makes sense. Events that could happen in the world (hopefully not a resonance cascade). You never lose control and are forced to look at something except for like 2 instances. One instance where you get jumped, and a second instance at the end of the game (which I will not explain because I would like to keep the review spoiler-free). Now, Half-Life may have good immersion, but it doesn't really matter whenever you have bad gameplay. Luckily, you don't have to worry about that. Half-Life is the foundation of everything on this website: Steam. Half-Life is the foundation of Valve. I'd say it's about time to thank Valve for everything you see here and give their first ever *RELEASED* project a chance. Please, give it a shot. Enjoy the game. Don't sit here reading the whole review just to read it, and feel accomplished. You should play Half-Life, now!",1672322956,1700624960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Quite possibly one of the best crafted FPS experience that truly makes this game a timeless classic.

Have yet got your hands on this? Do yourself a favor and get this game, then join countless of others who will just agree ""yes"" to you. And if you're perhaps someone who could be considered a lazy zoomer, just remember that true gamers don't judge on visuals but rather on the enjoyment of the experience.

My recommendation for the best possible experience will most definitely be playing Half-Life on Hard mode using only the latest auto-save. Unless you somehow soft locked yourself that is. Trust me, you will have great moments of satisfactory after a good challenge.

Just enable god mode from the start, it'll be more fun to enjoy the world and story without dying all the time.

I mean I can stay here and write a very long reveiw about why Half-Life 1 is one of the greatest FPS of all time but is there really a point? We've all heard of it, we've all played it and we've all loved it. So what is the point of this review? Many people like me weren't around when this game first launched and weren't around when the multiplayer was actually alive. Every time I have tried to play with other people in a classic TDM game, there have been exactly 0 people playing online. Until recently when Valve did a 25 Years Anniversary Event for Half-Life and added,updated and fixed so many stuff, that the game instantly got revived. There are a ton of people playing multiplayer right now and its awesome. No Battle-Passes, no 40$ skins, none of that bullsh*t. Just a bunch of nostalgic people trying to feel like they are back in 1998, and its the most hearthwarming thing I've been a part of recently. I had so much fun playing mutiplayer for the first time, and there is just no reason for you not not spend like 80 cents on this masterpiece and go back in time to 1998 to try to experience what it was back then.

Unpopular opinion incoming!!! 

Every frustrating thing was present; terrible platforming, old school terrifying ladders, instant death mechanics around some corners, unbalanced ammo (too much or too)... I don't mean to say that the game is 100% bad at all, but I'm going in my 40s and I played so many games prior to this one... It's just impossible for me to review this title kindly. Especially considering how much people always told me this was the best FPS ever.

I'm not going to do the usual Story, Gameplay, Graphics and Audio breakdown and I'll just give a short review instead.

Basically, it's a classic retro shooter with a slippery footed protagonist and deadly ladders with lots of janky jumping sections. Game had a vision, for sure, but I played it WAAAAY too late to be able to enjoy it. If you're like me and was just wondering what all the fuss was about, skip. This is no Portal or Left for Dead. I guess what I'm saying is if you just wanted to experience Half-Life to know how it was like or if it lives up to the hype and you'd never played it, well... I'll say the same thing as for the Witcher series. Don't play the first entry. Oh, that's right, there's no 3rd entry to play.... Play the second one I guess.

It's Half-Life.

[hr][/hr]
[h2][b]KLSR;[/b][/h2]
[h3][i](Kinda Long, Still Read)[/i][/h3]

It is my firm belief that 1998 was one of the single best years for gaming ever. Let's take a look at just a few of the games from that batch:
   - Baldur's Gate
   - Fallout 2
   - F-Zero X
   - Grim Fandango
   - Metal Gear Solid
   - Ocarina of Time
   - Resident Evil 2
   - StarCraft
   - Thief: The Dark Project
   - Turok 2: Seeds of Evil
[strike]Oh yeah, that year also included Sonic Adventure and Gex. Can't forget those.[/strike]

And despite that competition, Half-Life [b]STILL[/b] managed to etch its name in history as one of the most important milestones in gaming history. That alone is enough to earn the game respect, but is it still worth playing after 25 years of graphical development and modern gaming conventions? Well, let's take a look at what it still brings to the table:
   - An atmospheric setting with world-building organically built into fun-first level areas.
   - Well designed combat encounters with a variety of unique weapons (each with their own niches) that reward both caution and quick thinking.
   - A masterfully paced flow from from creeping dread to puzzle-solving/exploration to high-octane action that keeps any one part of the gameplay loop from growing stale.

That, to me, is the heart of Half-Life. Strong atmosphere infused with character every step of the way refined by iterative testing to make gameplay flow as seamlessly as possible. Despite the dated visuals, despite the lack of realist conventions found in modern shooters (HL has health packs, no ADS, walk button instead of a sprint button, etc), Half-Life still excels in all the most timeless aspects of game design. It transcends being a good 90's shooter and transcends being a good shooter; it's just a good game.

9/10.
[spoiler]I'd personally recommend to switching over to Black Mesa once you enter Xen and finishing that game instead, as pretty much everyone can agree that Half-Life's final act feels unfinished. Then again, you should just play Half-Life AND Black Mesa, it's a really good remake of a really good game.[/spoiler]",1700604624,1700604675,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every update they did created new problems, this latest update 25th anniversary update. Broke Counter Strike 1.6 it does not run, In half-life I had NPCs get stuck in place, I have fallen through the map in to the void, there are untextured parts that glitch out, when objects like sliding doors take the same place with floor the texture bugs out. None of this issues are present in older non steam version of the game. You only need a small widescreen mod if you want it and you are good to go. For example Tentacle one of the 3 heads is not in sync with the scientist for how many years now? They even show the broken version in half-life documentary.

Half-Life turns 25 this year and it's safe to say that I'm late to the party. But I was surprised by how enjoyable it could be all these years later. Sure, the level design and intuition is a bit iffy in places (unpopular opinion), but I found the gameplay really satisfying in general.
Overall, if you are looking for a 90's first person shooter with some added context for the Half-Life series, give it a shot. But make sure you buy it on sale when it is ridiculously cheap.

Even though the game's visuals haven't aged well, it still has its charm. Half-Life is also a unique first-person shooter with sci-fi horror elements. Let's look into the pros and cons.

[The 25th anniversary is great and even though I have not experienced all of what's offered, I'm impressed with what Value has done for this game. I'm glad Valve still gives support to their games after all of these years.]

Pros:
• Good gameplay
• F6 & F7 are very essential and helpful
• Enjoyable set-pieces
• Pretty good sound effects
• Creative and interesting enemies and monster design
• Good storytelling in that the game speaks for itself and doesn't drown you in cutscene after cutscene, take notes game devs
• Classic characters like Gman
• Fun weapons like the Tau Cannon and Gluon Gun
• Last chapters were frustrating, but fascinating with the alien world
• Runs great

Cons:
• Platforming segments can be really irritating
• Chapters like Surface Tension can go screw itself
• Graphics have not age well

  In conclusion, even though Half-Life has its frustrating moments, the best parts of it and its pros outweigh the cons. I recommend it if you want to try a classic first-person shooter that isn't your run-of-the-mill military shooter. Also, it would be cool if Valve made a Half-Life 3.",1680617541,1700597990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, it doesn't hold up that great, and yes, all the audio in the game is extremely compressed, but you have to consider it came out in *1998*. This game raised the bar immensely for the FPS genre when it came out. Instead of your typical 'run and gun' games which were void of any sort of narrative, HL1 entices the player with an enriched story and complex worldbuilding. The player feels involved in the setting around them and progression depended on problem solving skills in various puzzles, not just combat skill. The dynamic enemies and the increasingly more dangerous aliens keep gameplay fresh, and the vast array of weaponry is awesome, it's only a shame the sequel lacked as much variety (but more than compensated in its characters, puzzles, and story).

Overall a very good game and not just the best game of the 1990s, but possibly the best FPS to date.",1700592844,1700592844,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False
