In the realm of video games, few titles manage to carve a niche so deep in one's heart that they compel even the most reticent of writers to pen down their experiences. For me, Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is that exceptional game. Although I traditionally prefer playing over critiquing, TF2's rich tapestry of gameplay, community, and personal growth merits a detailed evaluation.

[h2] A First of Many Firsts [/h2] 
""Team Fortress 2 is the very first shooter game in which, as you may have noticed, I have spent a considerable amount of time and am actively continuing to do so."" This sentence encapsulates my inaugural venture into the shooter genre, marking the beginning of an enduring engagement with TF2. Unlike any other game I've played, TF2 transcended its basic shooter mechanics to evoke a spectrum of emotions, from exhilarating victories to the bitter taste of defeat. My decision to financially invest in the game, participating in trades and navigating the community's economy, further solidified my connection to it. Witnessing the ebb and flow of its activity and being part of stories that unfold within its servers has been nothing short of remarkable.

[h2]The Double-Edged Sword of Engagement[/h2] 
However, no game is without its flaws, and TF2 is no exception. Despite the vibrant community and the endless hours of enjoyment it offers, the game is plagued by a persistent issue‚Äîbots. These unwelcome intruders disrupt the gameplay experience, especially on less popular maps, forcing the community to confine themselves to a handful of arenas. The inconsistency of the voting system adds to the frustration, with its effectiveness seeming almost arbitrary at times. Yet, these issues, significant as they may be, do not detract from the overall appeal of the game. They are but a testament to the ongoing challenges within its ecosystem, challenges that I hope will be addressed in future updates to revive and enrich the game further.

[h2]A Brigth Horizon[/h2] 
Despite these imperfections, my outlook for TF2 remains optimistic. The game's minor drawbacks‚Äîcheaters, scammers, balance issues‚Äîare overshadowed by its strengths. They stem from a larger problem of oversight, yet they are not insurmountable. I hold onto the hope that with time, Valve will breathe new life into TF2, ushering in an era of renewed excitement and updates.

[h2]In Gratitude[/h2] 
This review serves as an ode to Team Fortress 2, a game that has offered me countless hours of joy, camaraderie, and growth. ""Thank you for the memories, Team Fortress 2."" This simple yet profound statement reflects the deep gratitude I feel for the game. It's a reminder of the powerful impact a well-crafted game can have on its players, offering not just a means of entertainment, but a canvas for memorable experiences, friendships, and personal development.

In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 stands out not just as a game, but as a journey‚Äîa journey filled with highs and lows, challenges and triumphs. It's a testament to the enduring appeal of good game design and the strength of its community. Despite its flaws, TF2 remains a beloved title, worthy of both critique and celebration. Here's to many more years of capturing points, pushing carts, and making memories.",1585821574,1708439180,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

It is a fun and challenging experience that can provide endless hours of enjoyment for gamers of all skill levels. Team Fortress 2 was released in October 2007 and has been updated with new maps, game modes, and features over the years, making it an engaging and exciting game even today.

One of the best aspects of Team Fortress 2 is its class system. Players can choose between nine different classes, each with their own unique abilities, weapons, and play styles. For example, the Soldier class is a highly effective offensive class that can deal massive amounts of damage with its rocket launcher, while the Medic class is a support class that can heal and buff allies. Not only do the classes provide a sense of individuality and diversity, but they also encourage teamwork and cooperation, as each class is designed to function together to achieve victory.

In addition to the class system, another aspect of Team Fortress 2 that makes it so much fun to play is the wide array of game modes available. From the traditional multiplayer modes like Capture the Flag and Attack/Defence, to the more unique modes like Mann vs. Machine and Pass Time, there is something for everyone. Each mode offers its own unique challenges and play styles, and there is always a sense of excitement and tension as players work together to achieve their objectives.

Team Fortress 2 also features a variety of maps, each with its own distinct design and gameplay dynamics. From the wide-open spaces of Dustbowl to the cramped hallways of 2Fort, players are faced with constantly shifting environments that demand quick thinking and adaptability. This variety of maps keeps the game fresh and helps players improve their skills.

One of the most challenging aspects of Team Fortress 2 is its high skill ceiling. Players who are just starting out will find that the game can be quite unforgiving, with experienced players often dominating matches. However, the game is also designed to be accessible to all players, and inexperienced players can quickly improve with practice and dedication. While it may take time to become proficient, the challenge of mastering the game makes the payoff all the more rewarding.

In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 remains a popular and beloved game for a reason. Its unique class system, wide variety of game modes, and challenging play style make it a highly engaging and entertaining experience for players of all skill levels. Whether you are looking for a fun casual game to play with friends or a competitive experience to test your skills, Team Fortress 2 has you covered. It is a game that has stood the test of time and is sure to provide hours of entertainment. So, pick a class, join a game, and get ready to have some fun!",1708105328,1708281455,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

16 years after release, Team Fortress 2 is likely the most popular it has ever been. 
While Valve has done a great job keeping the game profitable, they have very little to show for it. 

Official matchmaking is infested with cheaters. They're not even real players. They're bots that any random person can host on a whim. This problem has persisted for several years and will likely never stop. Their cheats operate at a level VAC cannot detect.

As a F2P player on official Valve servers, you will not be able to use the in-game chat. 
This includes commands such as pressing E to call out for a medic. The aforementioned bots don't face any restrictions and spam the chat freely.

Since the 2016 matchmaking update that ultimately facilitated the rise of bots, vanilla community servers have almost gone extinct.
The ones that remain are filled with sweats, and you are at the mercy of what they consider fun. Most matches will be a stomp and you'll only see a fraction of the maps this game has to offer. Enjoy pl_upward and koth_harvest.

Updates have consisted entirely of community-made content for several years. There's even a ""community fixes"" tag in the workshop and they seemingly just ignore it anyway-- It's very natural for Valve to establish something and not follow through with it.

TF2 is a genre-defining masterpiece that deserves its place in history, but it fails to provide an adequate environment for new players and Valve isn't interested in changing that. There's no financial incentive to improve upon the game, so they'll just stay the course.

This cycle of abuse repeats its self regularly, each time Demoman promises me he‚Äôll quit drinking, that he‚Äôd try to improve himself and fix himself, but once he seems to be getting better something or someone will set him off and he‚Äôll spiral back into abusing me. Despite his abuse I refuse to leave him cause despite what he puts me through I still love him, and I still believe the he can change, and become the man I fell in love with again.

At some point we shall have children, the DeGroot family needs a successor after all, during my Pregnancy Demoman will take it easy, stop drinking, and it almost feels like he‚Äôs getting better, but once the baby is born and begins to grow up. Demoman will likely abuse our future progeny, at some point or another, to a lesser extend than me, but still he will. This abuse and our disfunctional relationship will likely leave lasting impact on our child. Maybe they‚Äôll learn from it and rise above it and become better people as a result, maybe they‚Äôll become the abuser to their own family one day. Who knows?

This cycle of abuse repeats itself till one of us dies, maybe Demoman hits me a bit too hard one day and I fall dead to the ground, maybe I commit suicide, unable to continue living like this, maybe I‚Äôll kill him, put poison in his food or drink and watch as the man I loved, yet the man who I hated, dies and I'm free of him at last.

The player base has a broad skill range, and often times you will run into people who are either just picking up the game or are overall mediocre. You will also run into people who have played the game so long and who know its mechanics so well that they are practically untouchable. This can lead to one sided matches with no real way to balancing them other than hoping that the auto balance puts an actually good player on the other team. Its really not uncommon to run into games where one team just can't win because 2-3 players on one team are killing 50+ players throughout the match. This inevitably leads to a snowball effect as no one on the opposing team wants to stick around, and so mid match you might lose 20% of your team just because no one on the winning side wants to jump over and is enjoying rofl stomping the other team. Bear in mind I'm not talking about competitive mode but casual.

Not only that, but sometimes people will not play to the objective or play classes that would make winning possible. You will have three snipers/spies on a team (irregardless of skill mind you) because instead of playing a class that can actually push the objective, they'd rather click heads and are too bullheaded to realize they're actively hindering the team. This isn't to bash good players who know how to make the most of those classes, but more towards the people who are unwilling to play a different class because that's what the team needs. It doesn't happen often, but its hard to have fun when you're the only high health class with a bunch of support classes which will amount to a 5+v1.

Bots are also an issue that plague servers, but its not as bad as people make it out to be. I would say 1 in 15 matches you will run into a bot/cheater, and the only thing for it is to either out play them (which is possible if you know how the bots/cheaters operate) until they leave, or leave yourself. Checking names using tab can tell you if there are bots, specifically the .gg series, but you'll have to find out the hard way with cheaters. I would advise against calling people cheaters as there are players who are just so good at the game that its hard to tell the two apart.

Maps are also a mixed bag. Some maps are good, some maps are shit. It's hard to know what maps are good or bad until you've played on them, but i recommend avoiding maps like 2fort, and finding maps that have a balance of both open space and tight corridors. Part of the skill in this game is knowing what the map is and how to use it to your advantage, and so learning the layout and what places are safe or death traps.

On the classes, i recommend anyone playing this game to play Soldier as their first class with just the stock weapons. Learn how to hit meatshots with the shotgun, you will need it for other classes like engi, scout, pyro, and heavy. Then once you've gotten used to soldier, then its a pick of pyro, demo, scout, and heavy. I say this because they're classes that you can do something in with low skill for the most part besides scout, who has a low floor but also a very high ceiling. Medic and engi are also good picks, but they're play style is different from the previous mentioned, at least for the low end of skill. Engi can be a front line class if you know how to use the shotgun and have the minisentry, but other than that he's not really supposed to be on the front lines and is instead there to make sure the team has a safe place to retreat to, off healing, and making sure you minimize walking time for your teammates with the teleporter (imo the most powerful building is that teleporter because you can win a game if you can keep your guys on the front lines more than the opposing teams). Medics on the other hand are hard to find and just as difficult to play if not moreso. You may not be killing many people as medic, but you will need to learn how to position yourself and honestly he's in many ways like a scout, just with nerfed offensive capabilities. Your main goal is staying alive long enough to build uber and heal as many people as you can. Spy and sniper are specialist classes that take time to learn, much more so than the other classes, and have the lowest floor of all the classes. It's not that you shouldn't play them, but that when you do you will make your team weaker unless you're one of the above mentioned untouchable players who know how the game works inside and out.

Game modes are also a mixed bag.  Control Points are a solid choice and what I would recommend playing your first time around. Payload can be both good and bad depending on the map. Advice on that one is to stick to the cart and don't be afraid to use it as cover and crouch. KotH is my least favorite because often times the tight map means that the enemy team can gather up and spawn camp you. Many maps make this easy to do, and its not uncommon esp in tight KotH maps. CtF can be a good mode, but many of its maps are designed poorly and lead to grindy stalemates. The misc modes are fun but often time you will run into friendly servers.

Friendly servers can happen spontaneously. They don't happen often, but they do happen. This is when both teams decide to just not play the game and just goof around. It's fun, and if you run into one of these, its nice to chill and chat with people. Late night servers have this happen more often, but they can happen anywhere and at any time. If you see someone dancing around, walk up to them and taunt, you'll dance too regardless if you have the taunt for it. Its best to leave those servers if its not for you as the community doesn't take kindly to friendly killers.

MvM and other co-op modes like v Saxton Hale are okay modes, and there are plenty of people who play them, but they tend to be either too easy, or too hard depending on your time and your own skill level.

Other than that, don't buy anything, and don't worry about having only stock. The weapons are reasonably balanced where it changes your play style more than it being an upgrade. If you are struggling with stock, but can play with an alt play style, it may mean you yourself have an skill issue and are using the alt play style you're familiar with as a crutch. Stock is very viable and and I encourage you to get familiar those first before relying on the alternatives.

Overall though it's free and has an active player base. It can have some low points, but sometimes you get those really great matches where you know everyone is trying their best and no team is set to win via the luck of the match maker. It's very much worth your time.",1706319183,1706319183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite the unplayability of the bot crisis, and the lack of attention from Valve, Team Fortress 2 still has a player base that cares and a thriving economy, which is insane. This games characters, each of them having a personality that you simply can not dislike, besides spies appeal in scouts mother, makes this game amazing. Without characters like this Team Fortress 2 would not be the same. Weather Valve leaves the game how it is or starts updating it more I will always love TF2 the same.

This game used to be good, but has devolved into a shithole of bots, zoophiles (if you don't know what a zoophile is, don't look it up for your own sake), nazis, and others. The community can be so revolting at times where it makes you question your sanity. I truly love this game and it hurts me to say this, but you can't play the game in it's current state due to bots and the shitty community. It also is not beginner friendly due to having a very steep learning curve. The bots also don't help with this, populating the majority of casual servers, leaving community servers where you can't just chill out and have fun being the only safe option to play the game. It's a good game fundamentally, but the community ruins it, and has lead me to stop playing the game. I don't recommend starting playing this because it takes a toll on your health.

This game is a Masterclass in character design and individual character personality. Every single one of the Scouts ""quips"" lives rent free in my head. 
Game is also a testing ground for great map designs and ideas with the workshop and the released development kit allowing aspiring creators a chance to throw their hat in the ring.
This game lives off of it's community and in every the game falls short itself, the community is there to pick it up and help you get through anything as well.

The matchmaking is atrocious, VAC does nothing, the game is bloated and runs messy, competitive play is too high of a barrier for entry and there is no support from Valve.

I'm cashing out of the little bit of inventory I have, I recommend anyone else here should do the same, the developers apathy and the communities chaos should be a sign of a dying game, and I refuse to experience the frustrations this game brings me just trying to play it anymore. If you have maybe a few friends and make a private server, or even better a LAN party then you will have a great time, outside of that do not even bother with the games community, bot hosters, cheat creators and even Valve's team towards TF2 themselves, they all have wildly and vastly different goals and capabilities that makes the entire situation an uncomfortable, dystopian and anxiety inducing place to be.

[b]I'll put here a tutorial to cook rice:[/b]

You will need : measuring cup, water, saucepan with lid, salt, rice, wooden spoon and a fork.

Follow These Steps

 1.Boil water and add salt
Pour water (for every cup of rice, use 1 3/4 cups of water) into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil. Mix 1 teaspoon salt into the water.
    
2.Pour in rice
Add it to the boiling water.
    
3.Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice
Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don‚Äôt over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky.
 
4.Cover the pot and simmer
Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.
    
5.Fluff rice with a fork
Just before serving, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.

Tip: Don‚Äôt uncover the saucepan or stir the rice during cooking. If it‚Äôs done before you‚Äôre ready to serve it, place a folded towel over the saucepan, replace the lid, and set aside. The towel will absorb excess moisture and condensation, helping prevent overcooked and mushy rice.",1485281573,1705475646,False,0,0,0.504761874675750732,0,True,False,False

New content are all from the community, the same corruptible community that submit ugly warpaints and hat. However, as bad as the community is, I just CANNOT handle the irony of witnessing Valve shutting down a fan project when the existence of Valve itself is based on the community. I wonder what would happen to Valve if Counter Strike never existed, or if Blizzard got their way with Defense of the Ancient. We fanboy-ed them for abandoning games that we put money into, stood behind their 30% revenue cut, and bullied Epic game store store into submission, all for an unstable service and 2 lost fan projects.

*If you dont take the game too seriously*
You should definetly not give up on it. I guarantee, you will be having a hard time.
[Dont kill people that throw a sandwich/food at you. Otherwise you might get vote kicked]
Also look out for people that you dont know that just randomly add you on steam and want to trade all your items against nothing.
Here are 3 golden rules:
1. Dont trust people that overpay
2. Dont log into any websites that these random people send you
3. Do not trade your items against nothing to offer. 
Something like a verification trade does NOT exit.

This game is the most diabolical trap man has ever created.  Like a drug, Team Fortress 2 will always leave you wanting more.  It is never enough.  TF2 will consume your soul and your life.  You will spend countless hours on matches that feel like 5 minutes long.  You have this little monster in your head that wants you to improve, to be friendly on 2fort, to try some wacky combination of weapons you haven't done in hundreds of hours.  ""Just one more game"" you say to yourself.  It feels like TF2 speeds up your aging.

There's this meme about how this game took 9 years of development before it was released.  THINK ABOUT THAT!!!  Imagine spending 9 years on a project having no idea whether it would succeed.  Most people today can't even bother spending 10 minutes on a history project in school unless its at the very last minute.  Was it worth the wait? Yes... but there's a catch. 

This game is very, very good.  I have made so many memories in the 1300 hours I put in (at the time of this review).  But I look back and wish I spent that time into something more productive.  Reading books, exercising, spending time with family, and now I'm heading into college and I refuse to live like this anymore.

You wonder why your creatively inferior friends play other trash shooters like apex legends, valorant, csgo, pubg, fortnite.   Games clearly made with the intention of profit and keeping players addicted rather than actually being fun to play.

You wonder why Valve is neglecting such a masterpiece.  It's crazy to me that I've been playing the exact same game for 1300 hours outside of seasonal community-made maps and the occasional bug fixes update and that come in a handful amount of times every 3-6 months.

You wonder why at times you're so bad at the game occasionally despite your hour count.  Go on reddit, steam forums, or anywhere else and you'll see people with such low respect towards themselves and their skill despite having hundreds or even thousands of hours. 

The amount of people I've seen with countless hours in TF2.  5000 hours, 7000 hours, 8000 hours, 10,000, 12,000, 15,000 16,000 20,000, 25,000...  It feels like I'm exaggerating or making this up but you will understand the more time you put into this game.  You don't gain ANYTHING from it but these people are attached to TF2.  Who even are they without TF2?  Where would they be without TF2?  Why do they keep playing TF2?

If you've read this far and you are considering playing the game or you are already playing this game, please take what I'm saying seriously.  This game is truly something else, in a good and bad way.  This probably won't be the last time I see TF2, but I want to live a better life.  TF2 has gotten in the way of that goal for too long.  Play this game with caution and don't let it take control of your life, especially your most youthful and energetic years, just for one more game.  

I love you TF2, but this bird is leaving its nest, and old habits have to die hard.

Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a team-based first-person shooter game developed by Valve and released in 2007. The game features nine unique characters, each with their own set of weapons and abilities, and is known for its silly and comical tone.

TF2 is a timeless classic, with a large and passionate player base. The game continues to receive regular updates and new content, keeping it fresh and engaging even after all these years. The gameplay is fast-paced and thrilling, with a variety of different game modes to suit different playing styles.

One of the most iconic aspects of TF2 is its character classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Players can choose from a selection of weapons to build their perfect loadout, with many options available through drops or in-game purchases.

Another great feature of TF2 is its emphasis on teamwork. The game rewards collaboration and communication, with players working together to complete objectives and defeat the opposing team.

Overall, Team Fortress 2 is a unique and engaging experience that continues to captivate players around the world. It's a must-play for anyone who enjoys first-person shooters or simply wants to have a bit of fun with friends.",1492880776,1705168773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""[i]was[/i]""


I didn't want to update this review. I still love this game, so so much. There is so much good to say about this game, from it's gameplay, to it's character, to it's visuals and to it's community. I think this is still one of the best things Valve has ever done, but I can't stand by while seeing the state that this game is in.

Team Fortress 2's state over the last couple of years has genuinely made me sad. It isn't to do with the game receiving substantial changes that ruin the balance like with Meet Your Match, but rather that the game hasn't received anything resembling basic maintenance that should be expected for a game that Valve is still receiving money from to this day, both through it's marketplace and through mass-key sales from updates that Valve occasionally releases every Summer, Halloween and Christmas. These updates aren't substantial but, honestly, for a game that's nearly 2 decades old... I would be fine with this. It keeps the spirit of community in the game alive and gives freshness to the feeling of this old game.


The problem is that everything else is crumbling around the game.

The Bot Crisis has been going on for years, but Valve made a firm and strong statement that said they'd do work and give updates to squash the bot problem. And we believed them. For a small period, they were good enough fixes to heavily decrease the bots. They weren't gone, but I commended Valve's efforts... but they didn't do anything did they? While I believed there was work behind the scenes, I'm not even convinced that any of the efforts they've made in the past 600 days since the [b][i]#SaveTF2[/i][/b] movement was towards the bot crisis.

It's nearly impossible to join a server in the current state of TF2 without it being nigh-unplayable. Bad actors using bots or hacks, spamming ear-rape music that deafens the players... it's insufferable. If Valve had any proof that they were constantly updating their ancient anti-cheat or are working on an update to take down this new wave of bots, then sure... but that's not what's going on.


In my opinion, if Valve isn't going to do fundamental maintenance to keep the game playable while still making money off it, [b]then they should officially drop support and close revenue streams[/b]. Not even a question.

Valve is making a lot of money out of an, as of now, unplayable game in it's intended form. Basic business practice says that they need to be responsible for the service they're making money from and not be hands off 100% of the time.

This is without mentioning the other recent event involving [i]Team Fortress Source 2[/i], a gamemode in the upcoming S&box toolkit that I was keep on seeing the results of, being DMCA'd in the past few days. For such a formerly pro-community company, DMCAing a project that had clear love and effort put into it... it's heartbreaking. If there was any word of hiring these passionate fans or allowing them official consent, sure, but there is no confirmation of this.¬†

If Valve cares enough about Team Fortress 2 to take down a project that had more effort put into it than the past 6 years of Team Fortress 2 being updated, then I expect them to actually put the sodding work into it and make it fun again. They're not going to do that though, won't they?


I'm saying this out of love for a game that has been a huge part of my life, existing for almost 16 of the 20 years I've been on this earth:

[h1][b]Fix your fucking game Valve.¬†[/b][/h1]

I'm done waiting to see what content you steal from the workshop and make millions off of while you neglect a project that has had generations of fans come to and enjoy. I'm done hoping for a chance that the ""security fixes"" finally rid us of the problem plaguing this game for nearly half a decade. I'm more aware than ever that you don't care about a fanbase that's singlehandedly making you more money than most other live-service releases today.¬†

I'm fully aware that, in all likelihood, people won't sit around and read this review, let alone a Valve employee that understands why I feel the way I do. However, if there's one person who agrees with my thoughts, feelings and sentiments on the topic, then it will have been worth it.

Unfortunately I can not recommend this game anymore due to Valve's negligence to maintain even bare-bones support. There are many issues but the biggest issue is the rampant cheaters and bots that plague the casual servers that instantly kill you from across the map. 

-One such issue is the severe lack of content. The last major update to the game was in 2017 with the Jungle Inferno update. Despite that, Valve continues to release cosmetic cases every season and maps for people to play in(not even made by Valve, it's all community made) for them to profit off of. 

-Another significant issue is the common bugs that plague the game. These bugs range from purely visual, to game breaking. Such examples are horrid performance, random cosmetics/particles teleporting in the map, flamethrowers having busted hitboxes, melee hit detection being god awful, and spy disguises are broken(making it very easy to tell if a disguised player is a spy), making an already weak class even worse. There's a lot more bugs I haven't even mentioned. The fact my Ryzen 7 CPU/2070 Super GPU PC struggles to run 60 FPS consistently in a firefight from a game made in 2007 is inexcusable, especially for a multiplayer game that's still widely popular and profits for Valve!

-Lastly, Valve doesn't like the modding community it once nurtured. Team Fortress was originally a mod made for Quake and Valve hired the original developers of that mod for the Team Fortress series. As of today, January 10th 2024, Valve has taken down a free community made project(From Amper Software) of porting Team Fortress 2 to the Source 2 engine that looks and runs much better than the retail product. Old Valve would have hired Amper Software already, but this isn't the same company anymore. Also Valve is fully capable of porting TF2 to Source 2, they just did it officially for CSGO(Now CS2), and Dota 2 years ago! Unfortunately Valve refuses to do so, and won't let the community do it for them.

-Valve, if you're reading this, please give the attention this game deserves, you already do so for Dota 2 and what is now Counter-Strike 2. This game needs a Source 2 refresh more than Dota 2 or Counter-Strike(which you already gave to those other newer games), especially since the source code got leaked which has enabled all these cheaters/bots to get into every casual server. If the game got a Source 2 refresh, it would make it significantly harder to make cheats/bots, give the game a modern refresh to it's look, and make it perform well on anything newer than a 2012 laptop.

-I hate to say it but if these game breaking issues are not fixed, a lot of players will leave the game, myself included. It's a huge shame because it's my favorite multiplayer game of all time that has one of the most engaged and committed communities the gaming industry has ever seen.

Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlands, this game offered to many a wonderful experience. Later updates would add cosmetics, weapons, and a ton of other things to sink your teeth into. Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as others, like the addition of crazier and crazier hats. In recent years, the community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game. Though, there is something important to remember...

We first saw those deranged mercenaries nearly a decade ago! This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these mercs aren't defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. You won't find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun that he just lugs around like it's nothing. Nor will you find a quick-witted, caffeine-fueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefield, dodging rockets and bullets like a madman. This game is very outlandish, and incredibly enjoyable. Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies... people want to come back, because although there's some basis and objectives for the game modes, you never play the same game twice. Every match is a total surprise. Even competitively, the 9 classes and variety in what you can play with, it will give you a new experience nearly every time you play.

Years of pushing a cart filled to the brim with explosives is a hard task. Thankfully, there are new faces, hats to wear, weapons to try, and a new experience to be had every single day.",1617380460,1704885610,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

However, I could never recommend this game to anyone who is starting out.

First off, there is the Casual matchmaking. You wait ~5 - 10 minutes to get into a game, just for the game to either be filled with bots that obliterate any player who dares walk into it's sightline, or one team that is overwhelmingly stacked and completely steamrolls the other team. Either way, the server will often become empty due to people ragequitting, leading to a repeated 5 - 10 minutes queuing just for the same thing to happen over and over again.

As for the competitive matchmaking, Valve truly just does not care at all. You are forced to have extremely high-quality graphics as well as having a certain viewmodel on your weapon, leading to some serious FPS drops as well as issues such as your entire graphics config being wiped. However, not all hope is lost it seems, as there are leagues that offer players to play a seasonal tournament. Unfortunately, these leagues are not well run. From cheaters who play for multiple seasons before getting banned, to legitimate players getting banned for the silliest of reasons, the moderation of leagues is laughable at best, and unbelievably infuriating at worst.

As for the community, it is a horrifying combination of all of the worst players. From furries to racists, weeaboos, and pride-flag-waving freaks that you wouldn't want to have near your children. This wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the fact that the majority of the community is like this.

We receive seasonal ""updates"" that bring the same boring-looking hats to the game, as well as maps that would make you question if it was someone's first ever project. People are too busy adding ""Tran S. Wrights"" doors to their maps than actually making a quality-looking and fun-to-play map.

The final saving grace of this game is their community servers. They offer different ways to play the game, such as community-made gamemodes, training servers to help you improve, and if you prefer to play a certain gamemode or map, there are servers out there that run 24/7 certain maps and gamemodes. However, some of these servers are poorly made, and will spam you non-stop with their ads. This isn't too much of a problem, since there is a command you can put into your console to disable ads (cl_disablehtmlmotd 0), however some servers [b]FORCE[/b] you to enable the ads.

I would highly recommend putting time into other games, as there are plenty of games that could suit the different tastes that TF2 does. And most importantly, if you do play this game, do not feed into the hivemind of buying fancy cosmetics and shiny weapons that everyone else does.",1525024451,1704394911,False,2,0,0.53071671724319458,4,True,False,False

However...

Valve has not updated the game in a substantial way in over six years. They have largely left the game itself to rot in an onslaught of automated cheating on their official servers, providing the playerbase with only minor content updates consisting of entirely, while often great, user-generated content from the official workshop. I cannot recommend this game to anyone unwilling to commit a serious amount of time and dedication to it.

Even if you are willing to make this investment, interfacing with the grander community of this game is a mess in it of itself, as while a small portion of the fanbase is quite accepting of everyone's own identity, a lot of the community comprises of older-school fans who won't hesitate to be some of the most foul people you can find in any fandom.

I don't want to end my review of this game on a negative note, despite the rating, so here's some ways to still interface with this game and have a positive experience:

Community run servers are a blessing to the game, as not only does automated cheating happen far less frequently here, users actually have the power to punish said cheating, unlike on Valve's own servers. If you're willing to commit time to this game, the servers ran by YouTuber Uncle Dane, named Uncletopia. While these servers have on average players whom are far more skilled at the game than anyone considering downloading it in the modern day, they offer and extremely similar experience to what Valve's official servers should be offering, with minor changes for the better, such as class limits and a more free form system of map voting.

As an addendum to this point, the game's competitive scene is still thriving to this day, with community run competitions being the reason some still play the game at all. With formats like Pugs allowing less experienced players in on competitive formats, its as accessible as it has ever been to get into competitive play of this game.

Another way to interface with the game is to experience fan-created projects and recreations of what they think the game could be like. Two big players in this region are Team Fortress 2 Classic, and Open Fortress. Team Fortress 2 Classic offers a version of the game catered to people who enjoyed 2007 initial release TF2, with far more visual polish and custom content added on, including the cut VIP mode. Open Fortress, on the other hand, is a completely new game, only borrowing its visual identity and base design from Team Fortress 2. It is a 'Quake-like' arena shooter, focused on fast paced battle to battle gameplay and is a treat for people who enjoy the types of games that inspired Team Fortress 2.

However, these shouldn't be how players should have to interact with this game to have fun. The default settings are terrible, communication on official servers is hidden behind a paywall, and to even have a marginally good experience you have to work for it, and without prerequisite knowledge of everything you need to do to even enjoy the game in its current state, this game seems terrible. 

One must invest so much time into being able to properly experience a classic such as this, be it by spending hours configuring the game to even run as it should on modern hardware, by playing for long enough to get into even basic competitive play, or by downloading player made versions of the game of which aren't always active.

It's been a staple of my teenage/young adult life, and there truly has never been nor will there ever be a game to replace it. I'm not recommending it because this game just isn't like it used to be due to neglect from its developers and the experience for a newer player is most likely to be abysmal. 

The game is infested with bots and cheaters as Valve, the multibillion dollar corporation with all the resources in the world, chooses to do nothing about it. Their way of ""combating"" this was butchering the experience for a free to play user by heavily restricting communication, instead of, you know, developing an anti-cheat that's actually worth a damn. 

But even then, I wouldn't mind cheaters that much if it weren't for the god-awful matchmaking system that's been stinking up this game since 2016 like a half-opened jar of rancid horse radish you forgot in the back of your cupboard since Bill Clinton's daughter got her dad's dick wet. Seriously, after all these years, I still cannot fathom a single positive thing it added to the game and we're reaping the consequences of it's addition as the bot/cheater problem wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as it is now if it weren't for it's inclusion. 

Even if you do get in a game that's absent of cheaters, there's still a good 80% chance that the game you join will be a complete steam roll either with or against your favor. Playing with friends and trying to introduce them to this game always goes south as it consists of: wait 10 minutes to be put in a match, wait another minute for everyone to join, have both rounds end in less than 5 minutes due to the teams being utterly stacked, wait 5 minutes for a map vote, then leave the game and re-queue for an additional 10 minutes anyways because half the server rage-quitted after last match. Oh, and pray to god one of your friends doesn't get autobalanced halfway through, as there's basically no way you can change teams unlike years before.

Because how you played the game before, you looked in the server browser, found a server that was running a map/gamemode you liked, joined with your friends, and if the game was unbalanced you could either manually join the losing team to help them, or have autoscramble kick in which worked at least half of the time. It wasn't perfect, but I 1000% prefer it over the utter nightmare that is modern matchmaking. It's not nostalgia either, a community made mod called Team Fortress 2 Classic has that old system I just mentioned and I can play that game for literal hours in a single day, something I haven't done with normal TF2 in the longest time due to how frustrating it is to simply get put in a match. I can't even really put my finger on it but this matchmaking system has been the WORST thing I have ever seen added to a video game and I think it's going to pre-maturely kill this game.

I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game's community, but at the end of the day I've realized if you play this in 2023 you're just going to encounter every flavor of manchild there is. Hope you enjoy playing with obnoxious furries, weaboos, racists, and pride flag waving weirdos you probably shouldn't have around your children. I guess there's nothing inherently wrong with having these people present in your playerbase, but if these groups consist of the majority, then that really says a lot about the absolute state of your game. 

We get ""updates"" every summer/Halloween/Christmas that consist of community made content with absolutely ZERO (0) quality control. I know the art style has been dead since the inclusion of paints in like 2010, but oh my god the new stuff that's being added to the game is almost inexcusable and quite embarrassing. I'm talking about cosmetics that have no regard for the intended art-style and throw team/class recognition out the window, maps that not only play like shit but look like baby's first project with the hammer editor being OFFICIALLY ADDED TO THE GAME. Valve literally cannot be damned to get at least 1 single person to check the quality of the content that's being included to one of their most popular IPs that rakes in tons of cash. 

So yeah, if you're a new player or somebody thinking about getting back into TF2, I wouldn't bother. I want this game to be remembered for it's stunning legacy throughout the early '10s, offering the most fun experience you could have online, and not the pathetic zombie that it is now. There's nothing like it, but there's a lot of video games out there you can waste your time with. Don't waste your time with this one. Save it for something more enjoyable and do not enable Valve's neglect by blowing your wallet on stupid cosmetic items.",1704169387,1704169387,False,817,54,0.83176887035369873,97,True,False,False

I played a lot until I was wrapping up college, COVID hit, then I found myself sinking another 1500 hours into the game over the next few years.

Despite TF2 not having the full game play changing updates we've missed for a long while, shout-out to the community for keeping the content coming. I know its mostly cosmetics, maps, and v-script game modes, but hey it adds a new experience to the game that I think folks are going to have fun trying out as they release.

Bots are still here in casual, sad I cannot play casual but I've grown to just be accustomed to the community server browser at this rate. Most of my time is spent in Skial/Uncletopia. (If you see me in Dustbowl, its probably not my birthday. If you know, you know.)

I've met so many wonderful folks throughout my time here that honestly give me more incentive to come back to this wonderful game and wacky community.

While I don't think new-comers will entirely understand the appeal of this game as we long time players have with all of the game's current issues, I would still whole heartily recommend this game to anyone to try out. Its free, why not?

Talking about this game is one thing, but experiencing it is another. Download the game. You won't regret it.",1676855559,1703874228,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The mixture is then added to a solvent such as gasoline and heated to crystallize.

Because illicit methamphetamine production is not regulated or supervised, and there is no quality control process, any number of cutting agents could conceivably be added to the process to dilute the drug.

The heating process is particularly dangerous, as there is significant risk of fire and explosion. The waste materials left behind are also highly unstable and combustible. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 1 pound of meth produces up to 6 pounds of toxic waste.2

There are many detrimental health effects associated with operating a meth lab. Inhaling fumes during methamphetamine production can cause significant lung damage and other respiratory issues, while handling the various corrosive or poisonous chemicals can damage the skin and eyes.

‚ÄúInstant Meth‚Äù Process
The standard process for producing methamphetamine requires space. Meth labs produce quite a bit of waste products and involve the use of numerous appliances, such as pots and pans for heating, stoves or burners, hoses for ventilation, curtains or other blockages, so individuals from the outside cannot see what is going on inside. This process can be quite expensive and difficult to maintain.

In addition, these sophisticated laboratories can often be spotted quite easily by legal authorities who are on the lookout for them and present a serious danger for the individuals who work in them, due to the highly unstable process of making methamphetamine and the combustible materials used in the process.

Some users and manufacturers use a ‚Äúshake and bake‚Äù method to make meth, where ingredients are combined in a plastic or glass container and then shaken and heated. The meth is then extracted.

Title: ""Borderlands Mayhem in TF2""

Scene: Moze, Zane, Brick, Gaige, Mr. Torgue, Tina, Maya, Hammerlock, and Lilith are sitting around a table, each with their preferred gaming device.

Moze: Alright, Vault Hunters, time for a break. Let's blow off some steam with a game of TF2.

Brick: Oh yeah! I'm gonna smash 'em! Who's with me?

Zane: (smirking) I'm going Spy. Sneaky and stylish, just like me.

Gaige: I'm Engineer, 'cause I love my bots. Meet Deathtrap 2.0!

Mr. Torgue: Demoman, baby! Explosions galore! Kaboom!

Moze: Soldier for me. Rockets are basically my thing. Explosions, right?

Tina: (excitedly) Pyro! Fire, chaos, and giggles. Let's burn stuff!

Maya: (calmly) Medic for me. Healing is an art, after all.

Hammerlock: (British accent) Sniper, my dear. Precision and finesse.

Lilith: (enthusiastically) I'm Scout. Fast, nimble, and always on the move!

They boot up the game, selecting their classes.

Scene 1: The Battlefield

Moze: (playing Soldier) Rockets away, suckers! Eat my explosions!

Brick: (as Heavy) I'm the juggernaut, bitches! Meet the Fist of the Badass!

Zane: (as Spy) Sneaky time, mates! Nobody will see this backstab coming.

Gaige: (as Engineer) Deathtrap, go fetch me some metal, baby!

Mr. Torgue: (as Demoman) EXPLOSIONS! 'Nuff said!

Tina: (as Pyro) Burn all the things! Everything is better with fire!

Maya: (as Medic) Healing is an art, my friends. Stick close, I've got you. üåà

Hammerlock: (as Sniper) A precise shot, and they won't even see it coming.

Lilith: (as Scout) Zooming around, dodging bullets, you can't catch me! üî•

Chaos ensues as they unleash mayhem on the battlefield.

Scene 2: Team Banter

Brick: (shouting) Moze, cover me! I'm going in!

Moze: (laughing) You got it, Brick! Rockets incoming!

Zane: (mimicking spy voice) I've infiltrated their base. They suspect nothing.

Gaige: (to Deathtrap) Fetch that intel, buddy! Good robot!

Mr. Torgue: (yelling) EXPLOSIONS, EXPLOSIONS, EXPLOSIONS!

Tina: (maniacal laughter) Burn, baby, burn!

Maya: (healing) Stay close, everyone. I've got healing for days. üåü

Hammerlock: (calmly) One shot, one kill. Classic Sniper style.

Lilith: (running around) Zoom, zoom! Dodging bullets like a pro! üòé

Scene 3: Victory Dance

They secure the win and celebrate.

Moze: GG, Vault Hunters! That was some epic gaming.

Zane: (smirking) Clearly, my Spy skills were unmatched.

Brick: Explosions make everything better! High-fives!

Gaige: Deathtrap, you're the real MVP.

Mr. Torgue: (yelling) THAT WAS FREAKIN' AWESOME! EXPLOSIONS, BABY!

Tina: Burninating the countryside, burninating the peasants...

Maya: Good job, everyone. Healing was on point. üåü

Hammerlock: A precise shot is like poetry in motion.

Lilith: (grinning) Fast, nimble, and unstoppable! Scout for the win! üòé

They continue celebrating, sharing laughs and high-fives, immersed in the chaos of both worlds.

[i] [b]Title: ""Mann Company Madness"" [/b]

(Verse 1)
I go out of my spawn, thinking 'bout what class I used to be
I got a loadout in my head, but it's not what I like to see
And then this big red team came down to smother me
I was left with no choice but to care about Mann company, yeah
So tell me what you want, tell me what you want
Why have you come for me? (Why have you come for me?)
'Cause I was fine before you came to my base
Now it's my sentry you see

(Chorus)
Saxton, can you help me?
I've been backstabbed, can't escape it
Have I done wrong? Am I guilty?
Why do I feel like, I'm suffocating?
Oh, what does he want from me?
Said, ""I don't know?"" but he won't leave
So I guess I got Mann company
I've got Mann company
I've got Mann company

(Verse 2)
I've been pushing the cart, but I haven't capped a point
When I try to push ahead, yeah, my team, they disappoint
So tell me what you want, tell me what you want
Is this just fun for you? (Is this just fun for you?)
'Cause I know that it's not, I know that it's not
Because I am you

(Chorus)
Saxton, can you help me?
I've been headshot, can't escape it
Have I done wrong? Am I guilty?
Why do I feel like, I'm suffocating?
Oh, what does he want from me?
Said, ""I don't know?"" but he won't leave
So I guess I got Mann company
I've got Mann company
I've got Mann company

(Bridge)
'Cause I'm trying to push, it feels like a rush
No cap in sight, no one's on the point
But I know I'm not alone
Yeah, I know I'm not alone
And you shoot at me with your random crits
But I won't retreat 'cause I'm dominating
This can't keep going on
No, this can't keep going on

(Chorus)
Saxton, can you help me?
I've been backstabbed, can't escape it
Have I done wrong? Am I guilty?
Why do I feel like, I'm suffocating?
Mann, can you help me?
I've been crit-rocketed, can't escape it
Have I done wrong? Am I guilty?
Why do I feel like, I'm suffocating?
Oh, what does he want from me?
Said, ""I don't know?"" but he won't leave
So I guess I got Mann company
I've got Mann company
I've got Mann company [/i]

Developed by Valve Corporation and initially released in 2007, TF2 has managed to maintain its relevance and charm over the years, thanks to its unique blend of fast-paced action, distinctive art style, and a community that is as passionate as it is creative.

One of the first things that strikes you about TF2 is its art direction. The game's cartoonish, almost Pixar-like aesthetic, is a breath of fresh air in a genre dominated by gritty, realistic shooters. The colorful and exaggerated character designs not only add to the game's visual appeal but also contribute to its lighthearted and humorous atmosphere. Each of the nine playable classes is not just a set of skills and abilities but a memorable and iconic character with its own personality, quirks, and catchphrases.

The beauty of TF2 lies in its simplicity. The core gameplay revolves around two teams, RED and BLU, battling it out for control of various objectives across a variety of maps. The game's mechanics are easy to grasp but hard to master, providing a perfect balance that caters to both casual players and those seeking a more competitive experience. The diverse cast of characters ensures that there's a playstyle for everyone, whether you prefer the brute force of the Heavy, the sneaky espionage of the Spy, or the precision of the Sniper.

The class-based system is a stroke of genius, fostering teamwork and strategy. A successful team requires a well-balanced composition, with each class playing a crucial role. The synergy between classes, along with the need for effective communication, adds a layer of depth that ensures no two matches are ever the same. Whether you're pushing the payload, capturing control points, or engaging in the chaotic and hilarious ""Payload Race,"" TF2 offers a diverse range of experiences that keep players coming back for more.

TF2's community is another standout feature. The game's iconic hats and cosmetic items have become a cultural phenomenon, spawning a thriving economy within the game. The dedication of the community is evident in the countless fan-made animations, comics, and videos that celebrate the absurd and entertaining world of TF2. The ""Meet the Team"" video series, showcasing each character's personality and backstory, has become legendary and showcases Valve's commitment to storytelling within the game.

Despite its age, TF2's graphics have held up remarkably well, thanks in part to its timeless art style. The optimization ensures that even on modest hardware, the game runs smoothly, allowing a broad spectrum of players to enjoy the experience. The game's relatively low system requirements contribute to its accessibility, making it a title that can be enjoyed by players with varying levels of gaming hardware.

In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 is not just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon that has stood the test of time. Its engaging gameplay, distinct art style, and vibrant community make it a must-play for any fan of multiplayer shooters. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the world of TF2, there's always something new to discover, and the sheer joy of playing never seems to wear off. Team Fortress 2 is a true classic that continues to define the multiplayer shooter genre and remains an essential experience for gamers of all ages.",1477291280,1701594586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite being very old now, if you never played this game you really should, it's free after all so give it a try! This game is very unique something that games nowadays mostly don't go after. The characters are very memorable and the classes are fun to play with each of them being unique. The community of this game is great although it was better back then as it grew more toxic now but I guess that's also true with the entire internet so can't really blame TF2.

Honestly only problems with Team Fortress 2 is not even the lack of new major updates, but the lack of attention from Valve to deal with the Cheaters/Bots the game is currently having that been going on for a good while now. Their action to mute all F2P players now is pretty bad decision in my opnion, I see why they did it but have been years now. But I do appreciate the small team that must be taking care of TF2 right now by adding new maps and apperently new modes now once a while!

Overall, if you haven't played TF2, just try it out, it's a very special game even to this day. The game literally doesn't ask you any money. You can be as good as someone that spent thousands of their money. The game earns money mostly by selling keys for boxes that contains cosmetics. No advantages at all, this game is all about your skills and nothing more, no money will make you better than anyone. So give it a try!

Also... please don't delete your Gibus hat or any achievment hats lol lots of people do that and there is no way to get them back (unless contact support asking them to restore which I heard they do but it's best just avoid causing the trouble!).",1701193612,1701193612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Alright,
After hitting 3000 hours in Team Fortress 2 what is there I can say about the game?
It's not perfect.
It's neglected by Valve and abused by players who get off on exploiting the lack of fixes and official support. TF2 has definitely passed its glory days.
However TF2 has been more to me than a game, I've met so many amazing people through online communities and been able to participate in events, raise money for charity and make lifelong friends. To an extent I wouldn't even be where I am now without TF2. I'm moving in with one of my best friends of whom I probably wouldn't have even met if it weren't for this game.
So for the good times and memories, I will always love Team Fortress 2

[h2]Introduction:[/h2]
Team Fortress 2 (TF2), developed by Valve Corporation, has etched its place in gaming history as a quintessential team-based first-person shooter. Since its release in 2007, TF2 has garnered a dedicated player base and remains a shining example of how enduring design, humor, and a commitment to free-to-play can create a gaming experience that stands the test of time.

[h2]Distinctive Art Style and Humor:[/h2]
TF2's art style, characterized by its bold, cartoonish visuals and distinctive character designs, remains one of its standout features. The game's humorous tone permeates every aspect, from character interactions to weapon design. The clever writing and iconic voice lines contribute to a lighthearted and entertaining atmosphere that distinguishes TF2 from more serious shooters.

[h2]Class-Based Gameplay:[/h2]
TF2's genius lies in its class-based system, where players choose from nine distinct classes, each with unique abilities, weapons, and roles. The synergy between classes creates dynamic team dynamics, emphasizing teamwork, strategy, and adaptability. Whether playing as a nimble Scout, a support-oriented Medic, or a heavy-hitting Demoman, the variety of playstyles ensures that every match feels fresh and engaging.

[h2]Timeless Maps and Level Design:[/h2]
The maps in TF2 have become legendary, with classics like 2Fort, Dustbowl, and Badlands standing as testaments to exceptional level design. Each map caters to various playstyles and strategies, fostering a sense of nostalgia for longtime players while offering newcomers a diverse range of environments to explore. The timeless nature of these maps contributes to TF2's enduring popularity.

[h2]Weapon Variety and Customization:[/h2]
TF2's expansive arsenal of weapons adds another layer of depth to its gameplay. The ability to unlock and customize loadouts encourages experimentation and adaptability. The weapons not only impact individual playstyles but also contribute to the overall strategy of the team, fostering a sense of progression and personalization.

[h2]Community-Driven Content:[/h2]
TF2's community is a driving force behind its longevity. Valve's embrace of community-created content, from maps and cosmetics to game modes, has enriched the gaming experience. The Steam Workshop integration allows players to contribute to the game's evolving landscape, ensuring a continuous stream of new content and creativity.

[h2]Free-to-Play Model:[/h2]
TF2's transition to a free-to-play model in 2011 marked a significant moment in gaming history. The decision to make the game accessible to everyone, supported by cosmetic microtransactions, has contributed to its sustained popularity. The model showcases Valve's commitment to maintaining a balance between accessibility and revenue generation without compromising the core gameplay.

[h2]Evolving Updates and Events:[/h2]
Valve's dedication to keeping TF2 fresh is evident in its regular updates and seasonal events. The introduction of new game modes, items, and cosmetic items during events like ""Scream Fortress"" and ""Mann vs. Machine"" revitalizes the player base and adds an extra layer of excitement to the TF2 experience.

[h2]Balancing Challenges:[/h2]
While Valve has made efforts to maintain game balance, the introduction of new weapons and updates has occasionally led to challenges in achieving perfect equilibrium. Some weapons may be perceived as overpowered, requiring ongoing adjustments to maintain fair gameplay. Despite these challenges, the community appreciates Valve's responsiveness to feedback.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
Team Fortress 2 is a testament to the enduring appeal of a well-crafted team-based shooter. With its timeless art style, distinctive humor, and commitment to community engagement, TF2 continues to attract players from all walks of gaming. Over a decade since its release, Team Fortress 2 stands as a shining example of how a blend of creativity, community involvement, and enduring design can create a gaming experience that transcends its initial release and remains relevant in the hearts of gamers worldwide.",1446012253,1700969906,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Very beginner-friendly. Unlike games like CS:GO, new players have a very fair chance of beating even experienced players
+ You will get weekly drops of weapons (sometimes cosmetics too)
+ A huge interest in trading items via a network of trading servers and sites. Skilled traders can make profit in the form of real money as well
+ Tons of alternate gamemode servers like x10, randomizer, medieval, deathruns, surfing, jumping, trading, tons of workshop maps, etc.  
+ It depends if you consider this as a pro, but there's explosivejumping. It's so incredibly fun and there's over 500 downloadable jumpmaps and an active community behind it. At least a fifth of my hours in this game are spent on explosivejumping
+ TF2 uses the Source engine, a very comfortable engine and very easy to configure and save settings with 
+ Trading cards 

CONS: 
- The community can be kind of toxic and/or cringy at times
- Valve keeps adding more and more updates people generally don't enjoy 
- If you play TF2 now, you'll play with a lot of weapons that used to be different (usually better) in the past. Occasionally weapons get re-balanced and often break because of it

Ever wondered why people who play Valve games have so many hours in their games? Because most Valve games are solid and super enjoyable games that withstand the test of time; they're always classic and fun. Team Fortress 2 has been around for over a decade and yet its popularity is still up there with other top selling games.
I've played this game for years, mainly because it's such a casual game in which you can hop on nearly any server and just play without any sort of startup or gathering of resources required beforehand. Same goes for quitting said server.
This is a game you just keep on getting back at. It's too brilliant not to play, in all honesty.

P.S. Just a tip, play on community servers. I've never played matchmaking or competitive because it's just boring compared to the fun you'll get on various casual servers. Play it vanilla.",1487103966,1700915072,True,185,14,0.858293592929840088,17,True,False,False

There are also other aspects about the game that many will like; the maps (and rag-dolls) have a certain feel to them, that you can't get anywhere else, there is also diversity among each of the classes in terms of fashion and personality. Another aspect is simply being able to enjoy the sometimes relaxing/aggravating atmosphere that the game has to offer, is very much something that is unique to Team Fortress 2.

TF2 stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of multiplayer first-person shooters. Originally released in 2007 by Valve, TF2 continues to captivate players with its unique blend of fast-paced action, distinctive art style, and team-based gameplay.

Visual Style:
TF2's art style remains one of its most iconic features. The cartoonish, exaggerated characters and environments contribute to a visually appealing and timeless design. The bold and vibrant color palette enhances the overall gaming experience, setting it apart from more realistic shooters.

Gameplay:
The heart of TF2 lies in its team-oriented gameplay. The game features nine distinct classes, each with its own set of weapons and abilities. The diversity among classes encourages strategic cooperation and ensures that each match feels dynamic. Whether you're a nimble Scout, a heavy-hitting Heavy, or a support-focused Medic, TF2 offers a role for every playstyle.

The emphasis on teamwork is evident in objective-based game modes like Capture the Flag, Control Points, and Payload. Team coordination is key to success, and the game rewards skilled players who understand their role within the team dynamic.

Community and Modding:
TF2 boasts a dedicated and creative community that has contributed to the game's longevity. Valve's commitment to supporting community-created content, including maps, cosmetics, and game modes, has kept the experience fresh for years. The ability to mod the game further extends its replayability, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferences.

Humor and Personality:
TF2 is not just about shooting enemies; it's about enjoying the quirky and humorous world created by Valve. The witty character interactions, humorous taunts, and memorable voice lines add a layer of charm that few games can match. The personality injected into the game contributes to its enduring popularity.

Consistency and Longevity:
Despite its age, TF2 remains relevant and enjoyable. Valve's commitment to regular updates, balance adjustments, and occasional new content ensures that the game stays fresh. The fact that it has retained a large player base over the years speaks volumes about its enduring appeal.

In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 is a timeless classic that has stood the test of time. Its distinctive visual style, engaging gameplay, strong community support, and enduring humor make it a must-play for both veterans and newcomers to the first-person shooter genre. TF2's ability to balance fun and strategy continues to make it a standout title in the gaming landscape.

Hope to see if we get this update coming up in May.

Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlands, this game offered to many a wonderful experience. Later updates would add cosmetics, weapons, and a ton of other things to sink your teeth into. Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as others, like the addition of crazier and crazier hats. In recent years, the community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game. Though, there is something important to remember...

We first saw those deranged mercenaries nearly a decade ago! This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these mercs aren't defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. You won't find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun that he just lugs around like it's nothing. Nor will you find a quick-witted, caffeine-fueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefield, dodging rockets and bullets like a madman. This game is very outlandish, and incredibly enjoyable. Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies... people want to come back, because although there's some basis and objectives for the game modes, you never play the same game twice. Every match is a total surprise. Even competitively, the 9 classes and variety in what you can play with, it will give you a new experience nearly every time you play.

Years of pushing a cart filled to the brim with explosives is a hard task. Thankfully, there are new faces, hats to wear, weapons to try, and a new experience to be had every single day.",1485192881,1700688108,True,451,33,0.937977313995361328,40,True,False,False

However, I cannot recommend it in good faith anymore in 2021, 2022 or 2023. Especially after the game has been neglected by Valve for so long and how deafening their silence has been on a lot of core issues regarding the game - and I am not just talking about the absurd cheating problem - I cannot, in good faith, recommend it anymore.

Team Fortress 2 was released in 2007 and to say it revolutionized class-based first person shooters would be a massive understatement. Hell, I'd say it was a bold-faced lie. For years after it was released it was nurtured and loved by Valve, with updates helping to further along the game's core concept and add amazing new additions, like Payload in 2008 and Mann vs. Machine in 2012.

One day everything just stopped. TF2 stopped being updated. Valve seemingly had moved on from it. Nowadays, every so often, we get a minor update or a minor tournament announcement on the official blog and that's about it. Update droughts spanning months (or [i]years[/i] if major updates are what you're thinking) are unfortunately way too common. You can use the shoddy Competitive Mode as an example of this. Added in 2016 during the highly-controversial ""Meet Your Match"" update, improved upon with a better ranking system in 2018 during an unnamed patch (the fans call it the ""Blue Moon Update"" due to the Blue Moon Cosmetic Case being added that update) and then...that's it. No updates whatsoever since then. No lifting graphical restrictions, no class limits, no map pool rotations - nothing.

Same thing happened with stuff like the ConTracker - an amazing idea that was executed very well and then...abandoned. It showed so much promise yet Valve threw it under the bus entirely.

The community's doing its best to keep this game alive and kicking, with projects like CreatorsTF and just big YouTubers choosing to host their own vanilla TF2 servers rather than play on the radioactive wasteland known as Casual Mode, and honestly that's how I play TF2 nowadays myself - I go to community servers and stick around there for a while.

It's so sad to see one of my favorite games of all-time being treated and abandoned like cattle. Team Fortress 2 doesn't deserve the way it's being treated right now, but until that changes - my advice would be to stay away. Stay away until Valve shows they actually care about the game itself and continue to nurture and expand upon it. TF2 has so much room to grow, so much untapped potential that it hurts to play it sometimes.",1603319254,1700668627,False,2,0,0.542483627796173096,0,True,False,False

‚óã sniper bots joining servers to headshot people
‚óã hackers joining servers also to headshot people (wall, triggerbot)
‚óã horrible matchmaking
‚óã unstable item inventory, which instead of affecting only TF2, is now messing up with other games

Here's why this game has come into such a horrible state after months:
‚óã someone's policy to allow developers to work on whichever they want, so this game has had around 1-2 developers, which is understandable, thanks to TF2 spaghetti code
‚óã no significant updates for a year, only minor updates to patch up errors

The only thing that keeps this game alive and running is its community, which makes it more colorful thanks to new content.

After nine years of development, this game moved from alpha to beta to a half-baked dumpster fire. It's like you wear new clothes every month while living in a significantly downgraded house, which is actually a homeless shack.

The Good:
TF2 is a game with a low skill floor, but high skill ceiling. You can always find something to look at & improve whenever you're playing the game. Each class have their own ""unique thing going on with them"" that you can constantly learn and get better at to achieve good results. Soldier with rocket jumping, Medic with tracking enemy medic uber, Spy and trickstab, and the list goes on & on. This in return, will net you a long playtime on the game as getting good at one class is already quite hard in and of itself, but now combine it with the game other 8 playable classes, and now you have 9 classes which you can continuously strive to improve on either all of them, or try to master only a few select classes to their fullest.
or, you can straight up ignore all of that and just play TF2 for the heck of it. Most of TF2 players are really casual and laid-back. The addition of group and partner taunts only really add to the casualness and the laid-back nature of the game alongside TF2 other features such as ragdolls and random crits (while I hate the latter, it does definitely result in several funny moment on the rare instances where they are downright annoying). TF2 is like the few games where you can boot up a match, lost, and still be having a blast due to the sillyness of the game. You can sometimes even ended up queue-ing up for a match, only to witness the entirety of the servers just dancing around, eating sandwiches and in general just having fun. While yes, this is probably (debatably) not exactly how Valve envisioned the game to be played out back in 2007, these friendlies who aren't killing anybody are still unquestionably playing the same game as you, just in a different way. This results in TF2 matches being varied from one to another, you may get a match where everyone try their hardest to win, or you can be matched into a game where everyone just essentially chill and hang around. Even if you would to still play the game ""seriously"", you still wouldn't be able to avoid the goofy nature of the game such as being greeted with 3 spies and 4 snipers upon loading into a match, or laughing at new players who are playing the game (in a good, fun way, something something we were all new when we started), which avoid the game from quickly becoming stale. At the end of the day, it really is just something you ought to experience yourself.

A lot more thing can be said about the game, but to keep it brief, I will now go to

The Bad aka
GOOD LORD WHEN WILL THE HEAVY UPDATE COME OUT ALREADY:tm:
The game, despite boasting about how it is ""constantly updated"" in its description, isn't actually ""constantly updated"". While yes we do get the small updates here & there, it have been bloody years since the community have actually receive a proper, major update which adds in new weapons, or even just balance changes to the game despite the promise of an upcoming update for the heavy. This isn't exactly too much of a big problem due to the ""replayability"" nature of the game, but when you have been playing the same game for a decade old at this point and not exactly feeling like wanting to be the Ash Ketchum of TF2, it does make sense why a lot of players be leaving the game for Overwatch back when the ""TF2 Killer"" was still alive. Hey remember that game? The recent Summer update, which added in new maps are very much appreciated and I hope Valve will continue adding in new maps at the very least, but since it apparently even got delayed and all, yeah, I guess only time will tell.

The Ugly:
Bots who cheats in the game exist, they spin around and headshot everyone immediately the second they see you. Thankfully, most players can detect the cheating bots and kick them from the game in a couple of minutes when the votekick system actually works and allow them to. This is bad enough as it is, but unfortunately scummy piss-lover unloved players, also known as human players with cheats exist alongside hosted bot cheaters and they usually aren't as blatant as the bot cheaters who go around spinning and headshotting everyone due to them being bunch of coward pussy with fragile ego. They usually cheat in mostly subtle ways that most unexperience players probably wouldn't even realise that they are cheating in the first place. When your game have cheaters both human & non-human running around scott-free in the game due to VAC doing jack all alongside Valve lousy attempt(s) in fixing it (which was like, what, a year or two ago?) which ended up hurting new players more than it does the bot cheaters by disabling any form of communication on F2P accounts, I really have to ask, is it really worth it to boot up a game, fully knowing the chance of you ended up being matched with cheaters who oneshot you immediately the second you walk out of spawn. I don't think any logical & sane human would enjoy such experience.

Overall, it is quite a shame really, the game is very good, and amazing, and good, and fun, and superb, and good, but the ignorance coming from Valve is very disheartening. Remember #SaveTF2? Cool, whatever happen to that I wonder?
tl;dr Do I recommend the game? In the game current state, filled with bots & closet cheaters? No, god no, but if you were to ask me eight years ago whether I'd recommend the game or not, I wouldn't even have to think of it. Nowadays, I feel dishonest everytime I recommend the game to someone. How do I get people to play a game that haven't got (majorly) updated in years, with a majorly flawed anti-cheat to boot?

It was F2P when I first heard of it, so I did not have to spend a single penny, It was the most addictive game I ever played, I played it every morning, it is super fantastic. The gameplay is fast, it's fun, it's original. There 9 classes with different stats, abilities, wapons and hats, don't forget hats. The updates on this game are really exciting, fixing bugs, new weapons, maps, hats, etc. If you truely want to experience TF2, you must spend some money to do so.Anyways, since TF2 is F2P, so the community is one of the biggest in Steam. expect alot of F2P kids who yammer on the mike, and take the game too seriously even though it's a casual game. The gamemodes are original such as the payload mode, Mann vs. Machine, Control Points. Some non-official gamemodes are popular in TF2, such as x10 where weapon stats are multiplied by 10, vs Saxton Hale mode, a mode where a team fights against a boss which is a randomly selected player to play as Saxton Hale or some other boss such as the easter bunny, Christian Brutal Sniper, Painis Cupcake, the Vagineer,  Bonk Boy, Demopan etc. Anyways TF2 is really fun, it's still a thing especially the game is over 10 years old now. Anyways play the game, in my opinion, a Steam user is not a real steam user until they've played TF2. If Steam had one game to represent itself, TF2 would be the choice.




26/11/2019 Update

Valve, it has been 2 years since TF2's last major update not including Christmas, Halloween, season events, and various patches. Please release a new update and fix the unusual hat inflation problem as well.

21/11/2023 Update

For the first time in 6 years, TF2 has finally received a major update that added Vs. Saxton Hale as an official gamemode but I prefer the community version better. 
Still waiting for the heavy update though.",1514593361,1700595565,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

It can be a little clunky for anyone just coming to this game from more modern ones, but trust me there is almost infinite depth to this game with movement and combat.
Learn how to explosive jump with demo and soldier. 
Learn how to abuse people with scout movement and double jump.
Or if you like sniping, the sniper may be the single best iteration of a sniper class ever put in a game. He is extremely OP but very counter-able with the movement depth present to other classes. 
Medic is also a super fun support class and if you learn how to bunnyhop is quite survivable when jumped on.

TF2 has a lot to offer from public matches to solo game and community servers there are a multitude of ways someone can enjoy the game and with all the different weapons and characters no two games are going to be the same. On the down side there is a very high chance that hackers who has been ravaging the game for years will appear in one of your games.

Overall TF2 is a gem of a game that you can play for hours and not get board of whilst being able to play online and offline and in many ways.

Over my 3 years of playing, I'd say that zero updates was the final straw for me. I've done a lot of combos. I've traded items and done a couple of trade-ups. I have physically exhausted this game. This is like my 3rd burnout (at time of writing). Over my time, here are some things that were good and bad:

The Good
- 9 classes, all varied. Some share weapons, but never primaries. The characters have the old Valve charm on them! The VA's did a great job with their lines!
- Gun play is great, with tons of weapons to try and use for each class.
- Maps are balanced (Valve made and early community maps are pretty good).
- It was made to be fun, not a sweaty game. 
- Somewhat of a time capsule.
- Tons of cosmetics, WE LOVE HATS!
- Decent community, amazing SFM content.
- Microtransactions are PURELY cosmetic ones. 
- Drop system grants weapons and cosmetics (the cosmetic drops are rare but servers freak out, its a different, but cool feeling).
- Its a time capsule.
- Sort of cartoony artstyle. 
- Hard difficulty curve, but you can overcome it with time. This is a con, however if you stay long enough you'll appreciate the game more. If you need help, check class tutorials on YouTube. They really help!


The Bad (aka Volvo Plz Fix)
- Bots, bots, bots. They're everywhere. Valve has actively done nothing to cheaters. They roam everywhere. HOWEVER that is region depending. The U.S. servers are just... atrocious sometimes.
- The racism is rare (in my experiences) but exists nonetheless. This is strictly a player issue. 
- Report functions don't work. Voting does however.
- NEED PREMIUM TO TALK (this WAS a F2P feature and everyone's feature) REASON: This was Valve's response to cheaters. Did it fix things? No. The bots still snipe you hard. However, no more ear-aching high volume racism or music. 
- Dead modes, specifically Versus Saxton Hale. PASSTIME is cool though, and I don't think its bad at all but its over here anyways.
- No recent balance changes. Heavy is somewhat under-powered and Sniper is overpowered (yes I am aware that people will say ""skill issue"" and ignore that fact that one good Sniper can wipe an entire team regardless of skill level).
- Updates are, as the kids say, MID. They are strictly seasonal. 
- I will not bash competitive MODE. I want to try it out so bad. But its usually dead. The community hates it, even though y'all helped its creation. 
- Some people want the old Valve matchmaking system back but old server menus are cluttered and confusing. Not against the return of Arena or Quickplay (every modern game has these modes).
- Very questionable cases and warpaints. Most are objectively crap. However, there are some good ones. 
- Microtransactions from ages ago are still priced high when you can trade for them cheaper and easier. 
- Most furries that play this game are weird. I mean, come on guys. CALM DOWN. 
- Figureheads in the community are usually fine, but some have drastically done things to the micro-society in this game and artificially inflated prices for many items on the market. 
- Old HUD and graphics options. (An easy fix is to look for something like MasterComfig for graphics, and there are many custom HUDs available on the internet so you can fix both).


My initial thoughts on this title are positive, however with three years of experience, I did find some negatives. Don't let this review confuse you; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS. But some decisions the devs made recently as well as the content not being as engaging have led me to take a hiatus. I'll come back soon.

Getting killed the second you respawn, by a sniper spinning in place in front of the gates over and over while his team is refusing to kick him, this is the gameplay you will experience after downloading this game.
I always held hope that the game is still a masterpiece and it's just a string of bad events that make it less enjoyable, but no more.
I've played this game for almost 10 years now, haven't seen it updated in any major way except adding more micro transactions in 6 years. All the cosmetics added aren't even made by the developers, but bought off the community. Anti-cheat hasn't been updated since then either, because all Valve cares about is the money flow they get from dumb fucks like me who still love the game despite the fact the devs couldn't give less of a shit about any of it's players.

The Classic Method

-Rinse the rice.
-Use the right ratio of water. Add 2 parts water and 1 part rice to a large pot. For slightly firmer rice, use 1 part liquid to 2/3 parts rice.
-Bring the water to a boil. Once it's boiling, add a big pinch of salt.
-Maintain a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight fitting lid, and maintain a gentle simmer.
-Cook without peeking or stirring. Cook until the water is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Try not to peek until the end of the cooking time so the steam doesn't escape. Whatever you do, don't mix the rice while it's cooking ‚Äî this will lead to gummy rice.
-Let the rice rest covered. Turn off the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes. During this time, the rice will steam for extra fluffy results.
-Fluff the rice with a fork.

The Pasta Method

-Rinse the rice.
-Bring water to a boil, then add the rice. Fill the pot with water (no need to measure) and salt it ‚Äî just like you do with pasta water. Bring it to a boil and then carefully add your desired amount of rice.
-Maintain a boil. Boil uncovered without stirring until the rice is softened through but still a tad al dente (read: not mushy).
-Drain the rice. Drain the rice through a fine mesh strainer.

The Pilaf Method

-Rinse the rice.
-Toast the rice to complement the nuttiness. We love toasting all sorts of rice, but when you toast aromatic rice, the results pay off exponentially. Add 1 part rice to a pot with a dab of oil or butter and cook over medium until it looks toasted and smells nutty, 2 to 3 minutes.
-Bring water to a boil before adding it to the rice. Meanwhile, bring 2 parts of water to a boil. Pouring already boiling water on top of the rice helps control the exact amount of water you're adding, something that's important for basmati and jasmine rice because they're on the starchy side and can end up gummy. You're aiming to achieve separate grains.
-Simmer the rice. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, about 18 minutes.
-Let the rice rest covered. Turn off the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes to allow it to steam.
-Fluff with a fork.

How to Cook Rice in a Rice Cooker

-Rinse the rice.
-Use a 1:1 water to rice ratio. This ratio applies to larger batches too. While it can be used with smaller amounts, the water doesn't absorb at the same rate, which could affect your end result. You'll have to play around a little with the cooker, using your manual's guidelines, to see what works best with different recipes and for your individual needs.
-Let the rice cooker do all the work for you. Press the ""on"" button and the cooker will handle the cooking time.
-Let the rice rest covered. Let it rest, covered, for about 10 minutes for fluffy results.

How to Cook Rice In the Microwave

-Rinse the rice.
-Use a large heat-safe container. A large bowl square baking dish works perfectly. Keep in mind that the rice will expand as it cooks.
-Use 2 parts rice to 3 1/2 parts water.
-Microwave on high uncovered first. Microwave until steam holes appear and a lot of the water has disappeared. If you're using 2 cups of rice, this will be for about 10 minutes.
-Microwave covered on medium-low. Use heat-safe plastic wrap and cook until the liquid is completely absorbed (about 15 minutes for 2 cups of rice).
-Fluff and season before serving. Use a fork to fluff the grain, seasoning as you do this

Memorable mercenaries, lots of hats, balanced multiplayer gameplay, and a strong sense of community are what keep players coming back for more even after 16 years since it first released as part of The Orange Box.

Just one thing of the utmost importance: Stick with the community servers. Unfortunately, for over three years now, official matchmaking servers have been plagued with Sniper bots that have aimbot and will one-shot you without fail if they see you, all while spamming inappropriate things in the chat. The closest experience you can get to playing traditional TF2 without having to deal with these bots is through the Uncletopia servers (Courtesy of beloved Engineer main Uncle Dane).",1317737991,1699036520,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The cartoon-inspired depictions of the different classes are amazing and add to the character and humour of the game.  Each class has unique abilities and weapons that can perform different roles in the team.

To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your primary fire. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press your primary fire again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your primary fire again to stop the commentary. In addition, your secondary fire will cycle you through all the commentary nodes in the level.

What isn't fun is joining a Quick play round and instantly getting a L in your face because, you just wanted to play a round not on a community server. Then there are bots which became rarer to encouter for me but it all depends on [b]what time[/b] you start playing.

It scratches the itch of being able to work on a mechanic of gameplay and continue to master it over time with a new and old set of players all the time. It‚Äôs formula of team based shooter is pretty much a perfectly imperfect masterpiece and very well did set the standard going forward which I might argue was for the better or worse depending on what a new games spin on it happened to be. Back to the game itself so the skill ceiling is very punishing if you aren‚Äôt in an environment that you even get a chance to improve. A lot of that can come down to tolerance of how people act online and your own personal drive to put in time either looking for content relating to the game or literally working on game mechanics in MGE or the such. I do not blame people for not wanting to deal with a lot of the players you will run into with this game but at the end of the day you hold your own principles. We are online and you should expect things to play out as they can being online. 

Personally I think people should realize that many others even those that might seem insufferable are just trying to find something to do with their free time. I work a full time job and want to get on TF2? Don‚Äôt expect anything from me I try to be chill and for the most part just play the game.

Despite the fact that this game has much less characters, it's better than Overwatch. 
- it has many more maps
- it's more fun
- has different weapons to spice up the gameplay
- the community is not toxic

UPDATE:
After playing both TF2 and Overwatch 2, I can say that TF2 has awful issues with cheaters. To the point that it can be unplayable.
Image you're connecting to a lobby and then there's a freaking attack of players with similar nicknames and they all use some kind of wallhack and aimbot. It's impossible to play like that. At some point during a day you can't even find a good lobby without these assholes. Good thing that adequate TF2 players kick them right away. But oftentimes you can't even do that because the cheaters start kicking everyone else first.

So far I haven't seen anything similar in Overwatch after several years of playing iot since 2017",1690576706,1695597434,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Three of the biggest issues being Bots, Hackers and generally the game being on life support. However, despite this the game still persevered as a result of a loyal playerbase, venerable content creators and a few select individuals who refuse to let it die on the Developer end. To all of you who fall in any of those three categories? I thank you.

As of recently bots have become significantly less of a problem and I haven't come across a single hacker in the past 30 hours I've payed as of this review. The game absolutely needs a free update as it's primary source of new maps is paid content (cheap or expensive as $0.99 a map for community made content that doesn't need to be modded in and therefore can function without forcing everyone to download a mod pack). That said, I still love this game and while it would be amazing. The game is in a surprisingly good stat for how long it's been since the last official update.

MvM (Mann vs. Machine) is still a very fun PVE circuit you can do casually for free or Mann Up for a tour of four to six maps that drop rare loot for each one you complete with extra gains for completing the tour. Community Servers have all kinds of wild fun things like unique game modes, custom maps and more, Casual is a collection of all of the official maps and game modes (and possibly some officially recognized community content) and Competitive is a much more slimmed down experience with some of the more irking features like Team Auto-Balance and Random Crits removed in a neat and tidy 6v6 game. If you're looking for a fun PVE/PVP Co-op FPS that's literally free for everything except the weapon skins, hats and taunts? I'd say give it a shot if you haven't already and if you have and are questioning my sanity? Try again. With no bots and very few trolls, the game has made as much of a comeback as it can without another major update releasing new content.",1355510993,1695418886,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That adds onto it, but god is the community so annoyingly toxic. In my many years of life I've never met bigger crybabies and bigots who just whine about everything. They die? They must say a slur. They die to a critical hit? They say another slur. Just feels really tiring having to deal with such people on a pretty much hourly basis. Quite literally a similar thing is happening with the bots. Back in the day, or rather quite a bit after the Jungle Inferno update (the last major update that brought actual content other than maps) bots started to slowly appear and the community started to simply find other ways to try to enjoy the game. It got to such a point that we literally had to ask Valve to fix the game only for them to partially fix the issue, but then nothing else. F2P players still cannot communicate with the outside world, bots still appear every 10th, 50th, 100th game and they still peak in numbers on certain maps every so often. 

The game could be better meta-and-balancing-wise, but that does not matter if I cannot literally enjoy it for the reasons mentioned above. It's such an amazing game with even more potential, but seals will not save anything if Valve does not do anything about everything. Hopefully it won't be a 'too little, too late' case. Maybe not everything has to be a drastic decision, but if the bots get completely patched, I'll be at least partially satisfied.

But seeing that the next 1-2 years will mostly be spent working on CS2, a game that is already garnering a lot of complains, then yeah... 

I'll just say that we want changes and we should demand them. Even if it's an update the size of the Summer update every 6-24 months and it includes MEANINGFUL changes, then maybe we will see TF2 flourish once again.

Oh and if people are just willing to say ""grow some balls"" then consider the following: how about you grow some balls and don't act like you're on a high horse when you literally live like a Discord moderator. It's just painful to see this game being neglected and yet half of the community still doesn't recognize that fact for some reason.",1688835094,1695243352,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

its apparently a really good sandbox for using cheat programs because there's 0 barrier to disrupt games until one account gets vac banned, then you just switch to a new account. 
you dont need items if you're using crit hacks, after all! 
no need to get different sniper rifles if you've already got a bot to help you out, y'know?
no need to wear hats when you're just in it for pissing off others, of course.

Like I said, it's apparently a wonderful sandbox for testing out that cheat program you put on your mom's credit card.

Team Fortress 2 is a catalyst for absolute chaos, insanity, hilarity, frustration and probably a good half of the memes on the internet. This is what I'd consider one of the last AAA bastions of absolute freedom in the FPS genre.
What do I mean by ""absolute freedom""? Well, it's a source-engine game, and valve likes to share, so the entire community gets tools to basically do whatever they want. 24/7 server that only plays one map for weeks? You got it. Mario Kart? You got it. Randomizer servers? You got it. Chill-out servers where everyone just dances and screams memes on the microphone? You got it, mister!
It's also old enough to shake off most of its issues. Competitive works. Pubs work. There are hardly any bugs that didn't become features of the engine itself and there's tons of strange places to end up just browsing the community tab.

It's been around since 2007 and has millions of players visited with its fast-paced action, strategy, and humour. The game's characters are a huge part of what makes it so awesome. They all have their unique backstories, personalities, and abilities. With nine different classes to choose from, you're always finding new ways to play. The gameplay is insanely addictive. It's fast, but not so fast that you can't keep up. The team-based gameplay is also super satisfying. Each class has a specific role, so you always feel like you're contributing to your team. Whether you're defending a control point or pushing the payload, it's always an exciting experience. But it's not just the gameplay that's amazing. The Team Fortress 2 community is also amazing. There are so many fans out there who have created their maps, mods, and short films based on the game. The art style is colourful and unique, and each map has its look and feel. The humour in the game is another big draw. The dialogue is witty and the taunts are ridiculously funny.  All in all, Team Fortress 2 is a masterpiece. It's got addictive gameplay, memorable characters, and a unique sense of humour.

Every chad gaymer who plays this game are the upmost handsome and homosexual people on this planet, guaranteed, or your money back!

Check the Steam Workshop, you will find many people making cosmetics that further sexualize and objectify these beautiful men. This game is 100% first and foremost both a hat simulator and a homosexual simulator, would recommend greatly.

It seems nothing can be about the rampant cheating, wild bots spamming non-sense (audio AND text chat), and absolute onslaught of in-game buffoonery. Games either become aimbot fests where a few cheaters go around one-shotting every other player or dance/taunt expositions in a public area with no real purpose.

The game needs to die or the anti-cheat technology needs to catch the hell up.

I'm also not a fan of the sheer number of micro transactions. If you want some of the best weapons, you have to either get insanely lucky, grind ad nausea, or pull out a credit card to buy/trade for them.

When OW2 was announced, I was prepared to pay $60 for the entire PvE portion of the game. Since then I have spent $0 on OW2.

I believe that these are the reason I feel cheated as a OW1 player:
The first edition of the game cost $40/$60, that version of the game was made offline, thus our game we paid for was taken from us
We have been dying for changes and content since 2018, but were told to wait under the guise of Overwatch 2
After that we got the same Christmas, Halloween, and Summer games events every year, we were told that major new events and updates would be toned down as the PvE content was coming along
Issues with OW1 reached a boiling point (CC in every new character, ability, moth meta, GOATS, hero bans, role queue etc.)
We were told this all would be resolved in the new Overwatch, where everything could happen, and nothing was off the table
Jeff went on stage and promised us everything we could want

On release disappointments:
New heroes were locked on release, as this is now a FTP game, which was very opposite from OW1 (But not from the industry)
5v5 was kinda baked, but some hero interactions really did not work
Free BP was essentially content-less, thus OW1 players that did not pay got NOTHING (Except Kiriko?)
Store prices were/are very high, not that I am against selling cosmetics, but they are crazy
PvE very much absent
Map pool that rotated, which made the game feel empty of content
2CP removed (no replacement)
Cards removed
On fire removed
Endorsement system gutted
Looking for group removed
OW1 competitive history removed
Level/Portrait border removed

On release positive changes:
A roadmap of hero releases, which included 3 new supports, and two tanks, we needed this
Three new heroes
Great cinematics as usual
Great UI and ping system changes
A new gamemode with maps to back it up
Increase in fidelity, while keeping performance great

I do think Overwatch is a good game, I mean all of us would not be playing if it was just boring or bad. I want to rate this poorly as I think that there are major issues with the development of Overwatch since 2018, but regardless this is still a game worth playing, so it is recommended.",1693945946,1693945946,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

440,64075564,76561198827055213,0,8,15129,37,15092,1708831196,"I absolutely adore this game as it's one of my favorite games of all time, however there's an overwhelming feeling of a blatant lack-of-care when it comes to the game.

I've looked through the source code when it was leaked and I can see that there's an overwhelming amount of things wrong with the game (such as pyro flamethrower range being assigned to particle effects, unneeded references for Merasmus in character classes, etc.) that create a lot of bloat and a lot of spaghetti code by developers who have created many aspects of the game in a roundabout way.

Unfortunately, Valve doesn't care enough about this game to even go back and make heavy patches or fixes. The game, as it stands, is a broken mess that has been almost completely abandoned by its developers. Which is terrible for the community, considering we regard Team Fortress 2 as one of the best first-person shooters of all time.

When the pandemic happened there was an influx of bots on the game, and I remember people complaining about it and defending Valve in forums saying that the pandemic is crunching the development of the game, so it could be explained that they would patch it out and fix it. The only problem is that the pandemic is no longer at a point of international concern, and the devs still haven't fixed any of the reoccurring issues.

The only updates that have been made are mostly related to cosmetics and fixing the appearance of those cosmetics. The maps still has issues of terrible map geometry and other issues that should've been fixed a long time ago, but Valve has taken a step into only caring about the cosmetics and whatever will make them the most amount of money.

I love Team Fortress 2, and I also love Valve as a company, but it's from decisions like this where it feels as if the community for this game isn't being listened to that make people stop supporting Steam and head to other places to purchase their games. Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic game, but I'll never be able to recommend it in its current state of pure broken chaos as it continues to have been abandoned by its community.

The last major TF2 update was in 2017, and as of writing it is now 2023. I was in elementary school when it had released, and now I am about to graduate high school taking college courses with no major updates or any changes until the 2023 summer event with Saxton Hale. This does not suffice as there's still a (now moderate) bot issue with casual servers, and no updates for the Steam Deck's compatibility like Half-Life 2, Portal 1 & 2, and Left 4 Dead 2 got. 

It is absolutely painful to be in a neglectful relationship, because you know that no matter how much to cry and pray to be listened to you never will be. You can only take so much before you fully abandon and move on within your life, and unfortunately since Valve refuses to listen to this game's community I'm going to just move on. There's a lot of memories and fun from my childhood that spawned because of TF2, and unfortunately the lack of being listened to was the straw that broke the camel's back. I am just going to move on from TF2 since there's a lot of other forms of entertainment I could invest myself into anyways, hopefully more fun and maybe some that'll provide even more meaning for me.

Valve, we love this game, please go back and give us something new... anything.",1582597194,1693693870,False,2,0,0.52499997615814209,0,True,False,False

He was chancellor from January 30, 1933, and, after President Paul von Hindenburg‚Äôs death, assumed the twin titles of F√ºhrer and chancellor (August 2, 1934).

Hitler‚Äôs father, Alois (born 1837), was illegitimate. For a time he bore his mother‚Äôs name, Schicklgruber, but by 1876 he had established his family claim to the surname Hitler. Adolf never used any other surname.

Early life
After his father‚Äôs retirement from the state customs service, Adolf Hitler spent most of his childhood in Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. It remained his favourite city throughout his life, and he expressed his wish to be buried there. Alois Hitler died in 1903 but left an adequate pension and savings to support his wife and children. Although Hitler feared and disliked his father, he was a devoted son to his mother, who died after much suffering in 1907. With a mixed record as a student, Hitler never advanced beyond a secondary education. After leaving school, he visited Vienna, then returned to Linz, where he dreamed of becoming an artist. Later, he used the small allowance he continued to draw to maintain himself in Vienna. He wished to study art, for which he had some faculties, but he twice failed to secure entry to the Academy of Fine Arts. For some years he lived a lonely and isolated life, earning a precarious livelihood by painting postcards and advertisements and drifting from one municipal hostel to another. Hitler already showed traits that characterized his later life: loneliness and secretiveness, a bohemian mode of everyday existence, and hatred of cosmopolitanism and of the multinational character of Vienna.

In 1913 Hitler moved to Munich. Screened for Austrian military service in February 1914, he was classified as unfit because of inadequate physical vigour; but when World War I broke out, he petitioned Bavarian King Louis III to be allowed to serve, and one day after submitting that request, he was notified that he would be permitted to join the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment. After some eight weeks of training, Hitler was deployed in October 1914 to Belgium, where he participated in the First Battle of Ypres. He served throughout the war, was wounded in October 1916, and was gassed two years later near Ypres. He was hospitalized when the conflict ended. During the war, he was continuously in the front line as a headquarters runner; his bravery in action was rewarded with the Iron Cross, Second Class, in December 1914, and the Iron Cross, First Class (a rare decoration for a corporal), in August 1918. He greeted the war with enthusiasm, as a great relief from the frustration and aimlessness of civilian life. He found discipline and comradeship satisfying and was confirmed in his belief in the heroic virtues of war.",1693060381,1693060381,True,5,1,0.558848738670349121,1,True,False,False

Still the greatest free to play game of 2007 but still part of the problem. Love the game, I hate the lootboxes.  Short and simple. Games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2 fuel peoples gambling addictions and show their profits. To Valve's benefit however they have a robust marketplace where you almost never have to gamble unless you really want some specific 1000$ cosmetic.

I didn't know about the hundreds of trading sites when I made this review, but once I got premium, I had as many hats as I could shove down my fat throat. Surprisingly, the hats were this game's undoing for me. There was a nitpick that made the game damn near unplayable, and it was literally being unable to see my cosmetics on my character in first person. I bought the Cute Suit for the Engineer like three years ago, and the game slowly became unplayable because I couldn't see his gloved hands in first person. Same with the Arsonist Apparatus for the Pyro. After a while, the nitpick bothered me to a point where I just stopped playing. Especially not being able to see Halloween cosmetics unless it's Halloween or full moon. And yeah, you're right, I could just play on community servers. But I get tired of hoping onto x10, Minecraft, trading servers after a while. I'm trying to get back into the game because it was one of my favorite shooters but it is weird that small nitpick turned me away from one of the greatest shooters in gaming history.",1485522308,1693007993,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Valve has effectively abandoned this game. Not too long ago, the casual mode was literally unplayable for over a year, though that has gotten significantly better. Still, many weapons are unbalanced, and this game is extremely unforgiving to beginners. 
The game has taunts and cosmetics that make up a large section of this game and its community, but you have no hope of getting any of them without paying up besides a couple achievement cosmetics. You also need to find, trade, get achievements for, or craft weapons to get any but the first loadout of each class. So, as though first playing this game to begin with isn't already incredibly difficult because this game completely fails to actually teach you how to play, as well as inherently being difficult for new players just by the nature of the actual gameplay, now you also have to unlock flexibility. Beginners are literally handicapped because they can't switch their loadouts for situations.
And now to my gripe: You know how I said there are just a few achievement cosmetics that pretty much are the only cosmetics you can get, save for the cosmetic find maybe once every 6 months? If you accidentally delete them, they're gone. You can't get them back. If you reset your achievements to get the achievement for that cosmetic again, it just doesn't work. If you contact steam support, they have a ""No returning deleted items under any circumstances"" policy. Achievement items are not tradeable. And the way you get these achievement cosmetics is through the find system. Once you gain the achievement, you ""find"" the achievement cosmetic. This also means that when you get them, if you're not careful, you might delete them. I got this game when I was fairly young and thus didn't know what I was doing, so I deleted every item I found, including the achievement cosmetics. My account is completely unable to get these cosmetics forever.

Fellow Team Fortress 2 players, I accidentally deleted my achievement cosmetics the second I found them a LONG time ago when I was too young to know what I was doing. In particular, I can never get back the Ghostly Gibus. And Valve has completely abandoned their game, save for their second spare janitor to help the first one when they half-*ssedly said ""We hear you!"" after they got shouted at to support their widely loved game. They will never fix this issue. I'm livid. Still gonna play it, though.",1692983143,1692989568,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

there is one major problem, however. at the time of me writing this review, it has been 6 years since the last major update. summer 2023 update was amazing, but valve needs to return to this gem. the lack of support from valve has made their official casual server infested with aimbotting bots who walk around, kill people instantly and occasionally spam racial and homophobic remarks in voice/text chat.

Let the dough sit and rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until the dough get doubled in size.

Easy croissant recipe
Degas the dough and divide the dough into 12 equal pieces.

Roll each piece of dough into the shape of a disc which is approximately 16-18 cm in diameter and not more than 2 mm in thickness.

(3)Layer butter on each disc.
Easy croissant recipe
Place the disc on a plastic film and repeat the same process for the next piece and stack them over the previous disc and continue the same with rest of the divided dough pieces.

Easy croissant recipe
As butter is very soft now, we need to freeze them for 30- 35 minutes;so that the butter will not be very soft and will be pliable and it will be easy for us to work with the dough.

Easy croissant recipe
Roll them into long rectangular sheet.

 Now you can make bakery type croissants in a very easy method and get rid of those preservatives and trans-fat that are used in store bought ones.

Watch the video to see how easy it is to make FRESH HOMEMADE CROISSANTS using this easy croissant recipe.

How long do croissants last?
The precise answer to that question depends to a large extent on storage conditions ‚Äì keep freshly baked croissants in a dry area.

How to store croissants
Store croissants at Room Temperature
This Homemade Easy croissants stay fresh at room temperature for about two days. Keep them from both drying out and absorbing moisture from the air by storing them in a plastic bag or wrapping them in foil.

If you want to bring exterior back to crispy,heat the rolls directly on an oven rack at 200 degrees Fahrenheit, but leave them in for only 2 to 3 minutes so they don‚Äôt get overly browned.

Short-Term Storage
You extend their shelf life to five to seven days,when you store the croissants in the refrigerator. Wrap the rolls in the same way you would for storage at room temperature, in plastic or foil.

Croissants return to room temperature after about one hour out of the refrigerator. If you want to speed up the process, place the cold rolls directly in a warm oven for 3 minutes to heat them and restore their crispness.

Long-Term Storage
Can you freeze croissants?
Yes,Frozen croissants are safe to eat after freezing for one year, but they stay fresher if you use them within two months.

Shelf life of Unbaked Frozen Croissant pastry sheets is upto three months.

How to freeze croissants?
Wrap croissants tightly with aluminum foil or plastic freezer wrap, or place in heavy-duty freezer bag.

Double-wrap the rolls tightly, first with plastic and then with foil. If you plan to cook unbaked croissants within a week, you can also freeze them directly on a baking sheet and place them directly into the oven without thawing.

Baked croissants reheat well in the oven when they are still frozen; give them a few more minutes than you would heating thawed croissants.

How long do croissants last in the freezer?
Properly stored, they will maintain best quality for about 1 to 2 months, but will remain safe beyond that time.

How to know if croissants are bad or spoiled?
The best way is to smell and look at the croissants: discard any that have an off smell or appearance; if mold appears, discard the croissants.",1692562481,1692643693,True,2,2,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

As update after update came on the PC, I refused to switch over except for a little achievement farming and item collecting. I read the comics, bought the merch, dressed up as the Gentlemann of Leisure. I listened to Control Point, a Team Fortress 2 Podcast. Team Fotress 2 had an enormous impact on me as a kid. 

In college, I moved over to PC in time for the Robot Boogaloo update and became a Pupstomper, getting 36 kills in a single life as a Heavy on Payload. I got a few thousand kills with strange weapons, crafted a few hats, and then called it quits. After playing almost every week for 8 years, I stopped in mid 2016. 

Since then, every few months I've thought about selling my TF2 backpack, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. When Jungle Inferno came out, I was left behind. In the past 6 years, TF2 has changed a lot and now I'm not a kid anymore. I'm nearing 30; TF2 and I have grown apart and even with the Summer Update, I don't think we can ever have the relationship we once had. I tried to recapture that old excitement, but the spark is gone.

But for those of us who have yet to explore the game‚Äôs level of online play or tournament scene, it may not be immediately clear where to start. To make finding your way through the game easier, here are seven tips to help you score in each class and take your first steps in playing competitively.

Sniper

Sniper is probably the most readily available class for new players, and arguably the one which has the easiest setup. There‚Äôs no in-depth class progression or item builds to learn. All you have to do is pick up a mouse and a keyboard, find some friends, and then begin building up your skills. Being able to shoot fast and shoot accurately with little to no movement and relying on gunpowder and a sniper scope are some of the most compelling reasons to play sniper.

To that end, make sure that you keep an eye on your surroundings. Check for safe areas to hide and shots to take, even when you‚Äôre in a highly populated area. Some maps have walls which you can climb on or hang from, or tree trunks to hide behind, so even if you‚Äôre pinned down you can still survive a few shots.

Get ready to embark on a journey that's like strapping a rocket launcher to a unicycle ‚Äì it's fast, it's furious, and it's funnier than a clown juggling flaming rubber chickens.

Picture this: a game where the objective is as clear as mud on a rainy day, and the characters are more over-the-top than a Shakespearean play directed by a caffeinated squirrel. From the moment you enter the battlefield, you're thrown into a colorful chaos that makes the circus look like a Sunday picnic. You've got the Heavy, a mountain of muscle with a minigun that could double as a leaf blower. Then there's the Spy, who can disguise as the enemy and backstab them with the elegance of a well-dressed ninja ballerina. And who could forget the Pyro, a fire-loving maniac dressed in a hazmat suit ‚Äì because flames and fashion are a match made in... well, not heaven.

But let's talk about the weapons, shall we? It's like the game designers raided a toy store and thought, ""What if we had a rocket launcher that shoots actual words?"" And thus, the ""Quizzical Quasar Quantum Queller"" was born! From bats that turn your enemies into statues to guns that heal your teammates by serenading them with love songs, TF2's arsenal is a masterclass in the art of weaponized absurdity.

The maps are a whole other level of bonkers. Whether you're defending a control point shaped like a hamburger or escorting a cart through a carnival-themed battleground, you'll never know what kind of madcap adventure awaits around the corner. It's like Disneyland for trigger-happy thrill-seekers.

But the real magic of TF2 lies in its community. In a world where toxicity can spread faster than gossip in a soap opera, Team Fortress 2 stands as a shining beacon of camaraderie and camaraderie-induced hilarity. You'll find Engineers constructing intricate contraptions, Medics offering free healthcare (with a side of ubercharge), and Scouts zooming around like caffeinated squirrels (coincidence? I think not).

So, my pixelated pioneers, if you're in the mood for a game that's as unpredictable as a cat on a pogo stick, as uproarious as a stand-up comedy show on a rollercoaster, then Team Fortress 2 is your ticket to a world of wacky warfare. Get ready to embrace the chaos, savor the shenanigans, and shoot your way into a universe where laughter is the ultimate weapon. Remember, in Team Fortress 2, victory might be sweet, but the real treasure is the bellyaches from laughing that you'll earn along the way!",1369066125,1692045596,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Valve should update this more and fix the bot issue.

Played when I was younger on a crappy laptop.

Ran at 30 fps on a good day. 

Still was really fun. 

Played orange box on xbox 360 from the public library back in 2014? I think? Prob not

Bought the game on xbox 360 recently to re experience it. 

Was fun back then too!

Though I wasn't allowed to play it after a while because I was too young.

This game is a walking pile of junk, as there has been NO, new weapons since the jungle inferno update; As well with the recent summer update; everything was broken and I just think on how low standards does the tf2 community have that they even take the most broken, unfinished update as a ""tf2 is being saved!"". The problems it had in 2021 and still problems to this day, at least the developer team HAD some decency to fix major MvM glitches, but we already know why(gambling addiction pays the house)

on another note; I have never seen a community more toxic and isolating from others, this is just a bizzare community as its filled with cheaters, porn addicts, #savetf2 people or just outright idiots at times. 

played this game since the f2p update before, this game had a lot more potential but now it's just a dying husk of what it used to be. I remember each major update added new weapons, maps, cosmetics, hell even skins that looked decent, but now it's just the same styled items, there's no creativity left in it.",1558879969,1691919125,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

This game has not got a real content update since October of 2017. The only thing that has been added since is the worst cosmetics in the game that do not fit the art style and some good maps here and there. 
The game is extremely unoptimized and requires you to download a script to fix it which is crazy for a game from 2007. Without external optimizations, i struggle to run this game at a consistent 165 FPS. Every single other comparable game i can run with hundreds of frames and no frame pacing issues, not this one. this doesn't even touch the amount of bugs that are game breaking at times. weapons like the man melter are unusable due to horrible visual glitches. 
Even with all of these issues I would still recommend this game but one thing in particular has ruined it outright. The bot issue has been going on for years at this point and valve has done very little to do anything about it. They have made the game worse for free to play players and have done nothing to fix the issue. the game is completely unplayable at times. Right before writing this review, I got on to play a few matches. The first one had a blatant hacker that no one wanted to ban and the next 2 were ruined by bots! How is this game still alive with players or being sold, completely broken! They constantly add extremely overpriced stuff to the shop as well. Taunts are selling for 8 dollars at times.
 I love this game, but it is in the worst shape ever right now and until the billion dollar company that owns it actually does something fixes it, i cant recommend this game. BTW a lot of people that like this game will act like nothing is wrong and the bot problem is minor. It isn't. They are very jaded and delusional from supporting a broken product for years now. This game needs some serious help for years now and it hasn't got any of it.",1691857247,1691857247,False,2,0,0.501066386699676514,2,True,False,False

The game is a good written story as well. As a person who played shooters like Call of Duty, Fortnite, Csgo, and Overwatch out of all those game none of them can beat Tf2 since Team Fortress 2 is perfect. It is sad how Valve left the game to rot since it deserves more love. The game has a barely toxic community since there are more friendly people in Tf2 than any other shooter there is.

I mean, the lore is good, the art-style is made really well. there's atleast logic. Even if you do not count builders league united (blu) that pushes the cart to red team to destroy everything, random crits and 6 years of silence, it is doing pretty well. (the review was before Summer Update 2023)
-------------------------------------------------
Also, my opinion about tf2. Its good, but...
You better play on skial, either buying something from Mann.co store, bc its a scam.
To get expensive items you need to waste alot of time, just to grind refinded and keys.

After a good game in the comp I added him to my friends, because he sounds like a great man. We talked for a few months and became good friends. Lots of laughs, lots of good games, and most importantly, strong friendships.
I invited him to my house to do TF2. He said he would come, so I was looking forward to meeting him in real life.
When he got to my house, he aggressively pushed me against the wall, and started biting my ear, I felt his hard cock collide with my leg. I hit him, he started crying and ran away. Turns out he was gay, don't believe the guy",1691763808,1691763808,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

ANNOUNCER:
Intruder alert! A RED SPY is in the base!

[We then pan to the BLU SOLDIER standing at the board]

BLU SOLDIER:
A RED SPY is in the base?

[The BLU SOLDIER grabs his shotgun and dashes down the corridors of the base as ""Intruder Alert"" plays in the background]

ANNOUNCER:
Protect the briefcase.

BLU SOLDIER:
We need to protect the briefcase!

[We now see the BLU SCOUT trying to enter the room containing the briefcase by pulling on the locked doors]

BLU SCOUT:
Yo, a little help?

[BLU SOLDIER pushes BLU SCOUT aside and approaches a numerical keypad to attempt to access the room]

BLU SOLDIER:
Alright, alright, stand back son. [HE tries a combination] One. One. One. Uh...One!

BLU SCOUT:
Come on, come on...

[We now see the BLU HEAVY rushing down the hall at full speed, minigun in hand]

BLU HEAVY:
INCOMING!

[All three mercenaries scream at the top of their lungs. They all burst through the door which has fallen due to the BLU HEAVY's large body mass. The screaming calms as the BLU SCOUT pushes himself up and lands his arm on the briefcase]

BLU SCOUT:
Hey, it's still here.

[The BLU SPY clears his throat. We then pan the scene to see him at the entrance of the room carrying the corpse of the BLU SNIPER]

BLU SPY:
Gentlemen?

[The screen changes to the ""Meet the Spy"" title card for 4 seconds]

[The scene returns to the room containing the briefcase. We see the BLU SPY walk slowly towards the desk holding the briefcase]

BLU SPY:
I see the briefcase is safe?

BLU SOLDIER:
Safe and sound.

BLU SCOUT:
Yeah it is!

BLU SPY:
Now tell me. Did anyone happen to kill a RED SPY on the way here?

[The room goes silent for a second]

BLU SPY:
No? Then we still have a problem.

[The BLU SPY drops the corpse of the BLU SNIPER on the desk in front of him revealing a butterfly knife engraved in the BLU SNIPER's back]

BLU SOLDIER:
And a knife!

[The BLU SCOUT grabs the butterfly knife from the BLU SNIPER's back and starts to fidget with it]

BLU SCOUT:
Oo-oo-oo-ooh yeah, big problem. I've killed plenty of spies. They're dime-a-dozen backstabbing scumbags. Like you! [The butterfly knife cuts HIS finger] OW! No offense. [HE sucks on the wound]

[The BLU SPY takes the butterfly knife, closes it, and hands it back to the BLU SCOUT]

BLU SPY:
If you managed to kill them, I assure you, they were NOT like me. And nothing...NOTHING! Like the man loose inside this building!

BLU SCOUT:
What're you? President of his fan club?

[The mercenaries share a good laugh. The BLU SPY stops after a couple of seconds]

BLU SPY:
No. THAT would be your MOTHER!

[The BLU SPY drops a pile of photographs on the desk. Most of which is pornography including the RED SPY as well as the BLU SCOUT's mother]

BLU SCOUT:
What the--

[The BLU SCOUT stammers as the pornography is flashed on the screen. After five photographs are shown, we are back to our scene]

BLU SPY:
Indeed. And now HE is here to f*** US! Now listen up, boy. Or pornography starring your mother will be the second-worst thing that happens to you today.

[The BLU SCOUT is angered. Behind him, the BLU SOLDIER and BLU HEAVY are looking at the pornography]

BLU SOLDIER:
Oh! [HE shows BLU HEAVY the photograph in HIS hand. The BLU HEAVY looks in awe]

[The BLU SCOUT snatches the pornography from the hands of the BLU SOLDIER and BLU HEAVY as ""Right ]

Free 2 play (But has limitations for the F2P version that aren't nearly as bad as other games, and payment for entry is literally 5 dollars)
Every Class is available and ready to learn
Weapon drops that offer alternative styles to play the classes you already enjoy
High skill ceiling
Mostly friendly community
Plenty of game modes and servers to jump into, with a brand-new community gamemode just recently added.
PVE Content (granted there is payment for entry if you want the drops that come from it)

Cons:
Free 2 Plays have no access to use Voice Chat, Text Chat, or In-game voice commands. (Due to some bad apples spoiling the fun) Their inventories are also much smaller than the average Paid Player.
Game has a medium-high skill floor, while not impossible to play, you more often than not will find yourself getting stomped on the first few weeks.
Game currently has a bot problem, while not nearly as bad as it used to be it can certainly ruin the experience for first time players.
Lack-luster tutorial, (would still recommend it if you're completely new to FPS games, but would also recommend looking tutorials up online.)

Summary:
While TF2 isn't exactly the most friendly to newer players, the community as well as learning the games mechanics more than make up for this initial flaw. TF2 isn't a perfect game by any stretch but there is a reason why so many people clock in a lot of hours into this game, myself included. If you're an OW2 refugee, someone who just saw a funny TF2 meme on the internet, or someone who just wanted to see what all the fuss was about, I would honestly recommend giving this game a college try. If you ultimately play as a friendly or try your heart out, I welcome you to the wonderful world of Team Fortress 2.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

- Valve has basically abandoned this game for its more mainstream (and more competitive) games, CS:GO and Dota 2. It gets nowhere near the average playercount of these two, and has never been anywhere near it. The last actual update that wasn't just more cosmetics for stupid whales to collect was the Jungle Inferno update, which came out almost 6 years ago.

- The economy is effectively dead due to the above reason, and everything is insanely inflated. Person-to-Person trading was also nearly killed off with the creation of trading bots, who watch the market for the slightest margins and create buy/sell listings to kill off any actual competition. 

- Cheating is rampant, due to VAC being possibly the worst anticheat out there. Cheaters are usually loser children who have nothing better to do than sit on their computer and totally own! actual players, with there being some exceptions for those at the top. The most notorious cheaters are usually the most deviant freaks you will find on planet earth, proudly displaying how gross and weird they are. 

- There are bots running 24/7 from the same group of people who join public lobbies and try to take them over. These people unironically dedicate their time and system memory to running bots in a game that is basically dead. 

- The competitive scene is dead. It's all community hosted tourneys.

I've played this game on and off for a decade and no matter how many times people say ""it's good again!"" it feels like it's in a worse and worse state every time I return. Every added map is some garbage baby's first map that was made five+ years ago, official VSH feels like a waste of resources that could've been spent on actual game improvement.

Even after all this time, this game stands tall as a true masterpiece, with its brilliant blend of engaging gameplay, charismatic characters, and a dedicated community that keeps the flame burning bright.

Team Fortress 2's core gameplay is nothing short of exhilarating. The distinct classes offer unique abilities and playstyles, creating a balanced and endlessly entertaining experience. Whether you prefer to unleash havoc as the explosive-demolishing Demoman, provide vital support as the Medic, or lay down suppressive fire as the Heavy, every class has its own distinct role, making teamwork and strategy an absolute must. This dynamic and diverse gameplay ensures that no two matches are ever the same, keeping players engaged for countless hours.

One of the game's most significant strengths lies in its whimsical art style and quirky characters. The vibrant visuals and cartoonish aesthetics not only age remarkably well but also add a sense of lightheartedness that sets Team Fortress 2 apart from the grittier shooters out there. The characters themselves are brimming with personality, each with their own distinct voice lines and humorous interactions that inject an infectious sense of fun into every moment of gameplay.

Beyond the game's engaging mechanics and visuals, Team Fortress 2 boasts an incredibly devoted community. The dedication of its players is a testament to the game's longevity. From the passionate modding community to the frequent updates and events, Valve's ongoing support has kept the game fresh and exciting, even years after its initial release.

Moreover, Team Fortress 2's community-driven nature has given rise to countless fan creations, from artwork and animations to hilarious memes and unforgettable videos. The camaraderie and camaraderie among players transcend the game itself, creating a sense of belonging and friendship that extends beyond the virtual battlefield.

As a long-standing title in the gaming world, Team Fortress 2 has earned its status as a timeless classic. The game's unparalleled gameplay, charming art style, and devoted community make it an absolute joy to play, whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer eager to experience its wonders. Team Fortress 2 is more than just a game; it's an experience that leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of all who venture into its zany universe.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a game that seamlessly combines exhilarating gameplay, memorable characters, and a strong sense of community, look no further than Team Fortress 2.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

As you can see, after 15 years of development, this game is shÛ†Ä†it. It's not like the game is abandoned though, the devs still regularly release new updates (which mostly consist of new cosmetics, to milk the dead cow even more). The only people who still play this game are old players who are blinded by nostalgia, non-gamers who don't even know what a cheater is, and bots (especially at night your matches will mostly consist of those).

Maybe the game was great, maybe the game used to be fun. I don't know, because I only recently started playing. I can only review the game in its current state and the current state is terrible.

Update: I tried out this new Versus Sexton Hale mode (which for some reason can't be selected in the game mode menu, but instead has to be selected by deselecting all non-VHS maps) and the game just keeps crashing.

When they finally added good weapons skins that, again they didn't even make just took Community made ones they couldn't even manage to do that much right and ended up leaving parts of them off. They added VS Hale, a community made game mode and then removed it in less than a day because it didn't work, they keep adding broken or unfinished maps or maps that were never intended to be played outside of with friends or community servers as they have horrible optimization, balancing, and glitches.

This is a legitimately fun game. The gameplay is great, fun, and for the most part balanced. The art style is great, and the graphics hold up some seventeen years after release.
TF2's biggest issue is the lack of support and attention from the developers (And the hackers that have resulted from that lack of attention). The game has survived half a decade on life support with two developers; but somehow the community is still great, despite experiencing the video game equivalent of being abandoned by your parents in a walmart.
Honestly my biggest hope with this new update is that the community reacts well enough to convince Valve to give us another major update. Please I just want the Heavy update.",1689856280,1689856280,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1689788682,1689788682,True,676,224,0.865835011005401611,12,True,False,False

While mostly new cosmetics and maps, some of the maps are awesome, and majority are alright to doodoo fart, aka bad. Similar to the Christmas themed updates, but least we're getting updates and not left in the dust. (Stockholm Syndrome Detected)
If you haven't played this game somehow; I insist you install it over night (its a big chonker of a game for its age) and give it a try, with the amount of hours I have, I can guarantee you'll have a good laugh and enjoy the chaotic but charming nature of Team Fortress 2!

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
    [*][b]SEAL, SEAL, SEAL, SEA- did I mention the Seal enough? Too fucking cute for this world, and even fucking winks at the players, 10/10 ign[/b]
    [*]Sulfur is a Japanese themed map, probably one the best looking ones and surprisingly doesn't kill your FPS like Whatville does, or even some of the jungle inferno maps...
    [*]Phoenix is probably one of the most TF2 2007 looking/feeling maps out there, but man have I just encountered too many one sided matches that it harms the maps opinion, buts still an amazing map!
    [*]A good old community gamemode, ""Vs Saxton Hale"" has been finally added to the game officially by Valve! Basically one player plays as a super strong shirtless Aussie who fists you to death, and can taunt kill people with the flipping taunt. 10/10 if valve didn't remove it from the casual lists (probably to fix the issue but bring it back once its fixed, or so I hope/guess)
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
    [*][b]We still have hacking bots, valve plz fix![/b]
    [*]Venice is just Venice from CS:GO with the same amount of wide open space and maze like layout, down to the explosive objective, looks amazing but feels a bit like Whatville or (no offence if creator seeing this) a new mapper with good intentions fails to create a fun experience...
    [*]An odd bug where the props sometimes disappear making objectives or in general objects invisible; this sadly includes the beloved Seal...
    [*]Some of the maps, while trying their best, feel one sided or just in general not the best for gameplay or fun, but these are made by players like you or me, so can't get mad for people making content for free, for a nearly 20 year old game that even the developers don't want to touch with a stick...

This magnificent spectacle goes by the name of ""Team Fortress 2"".

Imagine, if you will, a land of bright colors and oddball characters, where one minute you're engaging in a heated gunfight, and the next you're prancing about wearing an absurdly oversized hat. Such is the delightful absurdity that pervades every pixel of Team Fortress 2.

Now, this isn't just any run-of-the-mill game. Oh no, it boasts of nine peculiar characters, each brimming with quirks and talents, like nine colorful candies, each with a unique flavor. The Scout zips around with an energy of a sugar-buzzed bumblebee, the Heavy, much like an elephant with a temper, creates havoc, while the Spy, sly and slippery as a fox, sneaks behind enemy lines. Each character is a tale in itself, narrating a saga of laughter and warfare.

The battlegrounds of Team Fortress 2 are as varied as Wonka's own confectionery concoctions. One moment you find yourself amidst the dust and heat of a desert outpost, and the next, you are thrust into the freezing snow of an icy wasteland. Every map is a new adventure, each mode a fresh twist in this candy-cane story.

And then, my friend, come the hats. Oh, the extraordinary, the spectacular hats! More in number than the candies in Wonka‚Äôs factory and stranger than his Oompa-Loompas. From towering stacks to flaming headgear, collecting these hats could very well become an adventure of its own.

In the grand scheme of games, Team Fortress 2 stands out like a golden ticket in a sea of ordinary chocolate bars. It‚Äôs a barrel of laughs, a tub of excitement, and an ocean of wacky fun. So, if you're ready for a dash of thrill with a pinch of silliness, step right up and welcome to the whimsical world of Team Fortress 2.",1494380316,1689628310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Boiling

Remove the husks and silks from the corn.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Add the corn to the boiling water and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the kernels are tender and bright yellow.
Drain the corn and serve immediately.
Grilling

Remove the husks and silks from the corn, but leave the husks on.
Brush the corn with melted butter or oil.
Grill the corn over medium heat for 10-12 minutes, or until the kernels are tender and slightly charred.
Serve immediately.
Here are some additional tips for cooking corn:

Use fresh corn whenever possible.
If you are boiling corn, make sure the water is boiling before adding the corn. This will help the corn cook evenly.
If you are grilling corn, do not overcrowd the grill. This will prevent the corn from cooking evenly.
Serve corn immediately after cooking. This will help to keep the corn moist and flavorful.",1587305738,1689574597,True,2,0,0.533437013626098633,0,True,False,False

I will say the good things first, and that mainly starts off with my long-time main Spy.
Spy is a class that takes hard work and perseverance to learn, but the more you practice and journey with him, the more you'll be rewarded.

You may start off dying a lot because you ran into mistakes an amateur would make, and then get frustrated after the Sniper, Soldier or Engineer taunts at you, but that's what they are; mistakes. Learning from them is the only thing you can do, and the more you learn what to avoid doing (and/or reading guides), the better you will get, and it is hugely rewarding; as you can start gaslighting the enemy and making them paranoid of you. Once they start obsessing with you, don't take your deaths personally; your team is going to destroy them with your help.

Spy as a class is unique to this game and I haven't seen another multiplayer game where I've felt so good destroying someone who was distracted.


Other good things include picking loadouts, which give you vastly different items for vastly different play styles. Demoman can be either your average Demoman with the grenade launcher, stickybomb launcher, and (get this) the bottle, or you can have the Demoknight who uses a sword, shield, and boots. I don't think many first person shooters let you go from Rainbow Six Siege to Fire Emblem.

Though that's all I can really say about the goods. There's probably more I can think of, but I don't want to keep this review too long.

As for one of my major criticisms, I can't help but feel the ""counter items"" were completely unnecessary in this game. The biggest offender being the Sniper's shields, Razorback and Darwin's Danger Shield.

Razorback's only use is to counter Spy, and DDS's only use is to counter Pyro. Stun-on-backstab, and afterburn immunity (probably to counter the Flare Guns). The mitigation for Razorback? Use your gun. The mitigation for DDS? Any other class. No, seriously.

Homewrecker would be a nice addition if it weren't for the fact one of its abilities literally is something only the Engineer should be able to do. Knocking off a sapper in one swing? Really? Using the afterburn to cripple the Spy isn't enough?

Regardless, those three are the main problems I have in terms of item balancing.

As for any other issues... well, I'm not gonna join the parade on bitching about Random Crits; but other issues I had were match-by-match, and not with the game itself.

Honestly, I still play it to this day due to how unique it is, but.. To be honest, the only way to really know how good this game is, is to play it yourself.",1689465474,1689465474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I won't even play this game anymore, the game's dead to me in my eyes, in the eyes of once a gullible child. I watched it die under life support, just like my grandfather who I've never really got to know yet he still made me cry that he's been leaving from us from this world. Maybe I wasn't around during his last days of life yet I still really miss him dearly. This is also a kind of allusion this game gave me. There's something parallel between these events as the most enjoyment I had in Team Fortress 2, I also had way back with my grandfather. I vaguely remember these days but I respect him as he was the remniscent and the last grandpa who stayed alive for so long. While I wasn't that commited before I saw him but once I did, I was the saddest kid living on the world. Nowadays my two grandmas hate on each other and they won't even let us in, due to [i]family business[/i]... let us just give my grandfather a moment of silence he deserves and remember him for who he was, not what we saw him be like during last days as I grew up I started to realize that he was the only hope there.....

Well, the minute has passed, let me continue my review as this was just the beginning and the introduction to what the review will be like. I think I've expressed myself enough there for you to understand what we're dealing with.

Anyway, I've kept hearing many, many promises from Valve and they don't just care anymore and I feel like they broke the deal after all. The first red flag which I saw immediately was the rebranding of this update from [i]update-sized update[/i] to [i]holiday-sized update[/i]. My concerns just grew further, still recovering from the Crate Depression of 2019 as to in what ways they were capable of ruining this game's estabilishment it grew during its [i]golden years[/i]. I still remember the day the Mecha Update was introduced and the new gamemode was amazing, it was very refreshing and brought the way of playing the game that wasn't thought of before, this is very in Valve fashion to make and provide interesting solutions to their games which have been tested and proved to live up to expectations. Too bad these words don't live up to today's Valve standards and I think the development course the TF2 takes is self-destructing and degradive for the hardcore TF2 fans which I am such fan myself included. I still can not believe that people honestly support this Hat Pressure dropping off the Valves from the Source itself. They think they can keep getting away with it, cutting the budget constantly only to underdeliver to their most beloved fans to return the Bitter Taste of Defeat and Lime. They can't admit they lost the battle with cheaters as this would mean the complete abundance of TF2 from community side. Don't worry, of course they care, just not in the way you would think.

[i]Look, there's that new VSH mode in the map pool! Go and play it now! You're gonna love it![/i] Yes, something refreshing, something new, I've been waiting for this for many years, oh yes, new voicelines, new maps, new cosmetics, new balance changes, new stuff-stuff-stuff! [i]From this time we'll be always delivering to you the updates you wanted for so long! Look ahead and stay tuned for the Winter Update 2023, it's going to be something special![/i]. Yes-yes-yes! [i]I can not believe that I managed to steal this much content and still not be seen as a filthy thief who just happened to know what the community has been scraping for the most.[/i] Uh-oh, this is not good, let's see what's wrong about it all, shall we?

Dumbass, of course, all of the new voicelines were made cheaply by the new voice actor with vocal range fitting the most TF2 mercenaries, nothing wrong, yeah? New voicelines! We don't mind that Valve could just try at least contact JB Blanc to record lines for Saxton Hale himself? We don't mind that people have been waiting for this update many, many years just to see it being underwhelming, just like TF2 always lately has been? Okay, do we still mind that dead people like Rick May should have at least got some respect paid here and not get replaced by a cheap knockoff from the 7-Eleven? Just like the hard work the community did with so many other things that never seen the light of TF2's day, working from 7-11 just to see their workshop submissions get ignored by Valve entirely in place of other items? At least when they take something from the Steam Workshop, they should do it right, not take it and make it as theirs. I mean, they have resources to deliver us the voice actors together and they just seem to be not commited entirely at all into cooperation with the community.

Alright, new maps, welp, I think I kind of seen them all before, next.

New cosmetics, ho-ho-ho! This is a tradition at this point. Since hats got introduced, it remained steady to introduce hats for loads of years. I mean, they're not boring like they usually have been but come on, this isn't going to fix the bot problem, Valvey, do something about this first, hats should be the least of concerns.

Cool, this update also saw some balance changes and it includes a map that has been unchanged, like it has been engraved into a stone and it stayed that way for years. When I saw that cp_steel has changed, I was honestly shocked. This means that there has been a complete disregard to the original vision of the map, just to make the annoyed people by this map smile just a tiny bit.

Look, I don't want to break it to you but Team Fortress 2 is literally a dying brand, a shadow of its former self. They aren't going to make it any better anymore, they're soon gonna dump it into trash and I think that by the year 2027, like it's 20 years for this game to even exist so for it to then die after it's [i]years of service[/i], serving its most commited traders and economists and preventing them from getting bankrupt. Team Fortress 2 is just like one of these games that have been ever made, it happened and now it's going to die. Death is unevitable.

As much as I loved this game from the beginning, I am now aggresively positioned against it as I watch it decompose into something unrecognizable and I mean it starts to mutate now, like a fricken corpse. Go on with your lives, it's time to accept that Team Fortress 2, the once game of our beloved childhoods, is coming to an end and this won't change.

For all of the people who have been supporting this game with greatest of the honors being Rick May and also my grandfather who has been passively watching over my life, it's time to sunset this game for good. I am leaving this game entirely, I am selling my entire lifetime spent in TF2 and I am never going to come back to it. My patience for this game is over. Goodbye, everyone. Stay safe out there, y'all deserve a rest. Dismissed.",1470923516,1689282194,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Although there are a 2 things that you should know in this game before you download it:

1. Valve doesn't give a sh about TF2, nope, don't ask for updates, they're now a multi billionaire company, they don't have to even update their OG games anymore. CS 2 is just like CS:GO with better graphics and better physics with the Source 2 engine, it's just kinda the same.

2. BOTS, if you really don't give a f about them like me, it's pretty fine but if you do hate bots like really REALLY hate them, uh, reconsider before downloading, it's not common but it's still annoying. 

So, uh yeah, recommended to play. Just.. don't buy stuff from the  Mann Co. Store except for Keys and Map stamps (props to people who actually buy map stamps), it's all just rip off.",1683630115,1689116652,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",1688755422,1688755422,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I have played this game for about three to four years now, and I still enjoy countless hours in it. It was the first game I played alongside Terraria and Garry‚Äôs mod. What makes it unique is that the conflict is presented in a comical style. There are still many players found playing Team Fortress 2 right now. 

As you play you can unlock more items or weapons which you can use in your fight. You can also of course trade with others for loot; just make sure they‚Äôre trustworthy. There is an aspect of play for everyone in this game. There are different classes for each play style such as support, defense, and attack. In total, there are nine different classes that you can choose from including classes like sniper, scout, and medic. 

Even though you may not be good you first initially start and pick up the game, as you play and spend more hours in-game your skills and technique will improve. Once you get a class mastered you will find fun and enjoyment in this game. The majority of the players in-game or on your team do not really care if you are good or not and that is another aspect of Team Fortress 2. There are also many servers to play on and there are even practice/tutorial servers to help you improve your skills, or master a class to play. 

Team Fortress 2 also has many game modes such as capture the flag and Control points. There are also other games like pass time. As you play the game you will be able to find a game mode that you enjoy the most. Along with the abundance of game modes, there are also a lot of maps to experience with different environmental settings. 

In the end, I would say that this is a really good game to install and play when you have time because there is not much more like it for free. As you play the game you will grow to a higher level. This game also has a numerous amount of achievements for those achievement hunters. Whether you are a skilled individual or a beginner this game has opportunities for everyone to experience.",1488052938,1688612088,True,2,0,0.553761184215545654,0,True,False,False

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Administrator: ""Intruder alert! A RED Spy is in the base!""

[Camera pans down to show a BLU Soldier reading the sign board.]

Soldier: ""A RED Spy is in the base?""

[Soldier grabs his shotgun off a gun rack and runs down the stairs.]

Soldier: ""Hut hut hut hut hut.""

Administrator: ""Protect the briefcase!""

Soldier: ""We need to protect the briefcase!""

Scout: ""Yo, a little help here?""

[Camera moves to BLU Scout pulling on a door handle. Soldier pushes him out of the way and enters numbers into the keypad.]

Soldier: ""Alright, alright, I got it. Stand back son. One, one, one, uhh, one!""

Scout: ""Let's go, let's go, let's go!""

[A BLU Heavy runs towards them and the door from behind.]

Heavy: ""Incoming!""

[Heavy runs into the Scout and Soldier, breaking down the door with Sasha, his minigun. Heavy runs towards the briefcase, knocking Scout and Soldier over in the process. Scout crawls up from the floor, while Heavy lowers his gun.]

Scout: [Screams,]... ""Hey, it's still here.""

Heavy: [Yells,]... ""Alright then.""

[Camera pans to behind Heavy. There is a BLU Spy holding a BLU Sniper over his shoulder. The Sniper is dead.]

Spy: ""Ahem, gentlemen.""

[""Meet the Spy"" text appears.]

[Spy adjusts the corpse of Sniper and walks towards the briefcase.]

Spy: ""I see the briefcase is safe.""

Soldier: ""Safe and sound!""

Scout: ""Yeah, it is!""

[Scout and Soldier stand up.]

Spy: ""Tell me, did anyone happen to kill a RED Spy on the way here?""

[Scout shrugs, Heavy and Soldier look at each other and then back to Spy.]

Spy: ""No? Then we still have a problem.""

[Spy tosses Sniper's corpse onto the desk, showing the Sniper still has a Spies knife in his back. A sharp musical cue plays.]

Soldier: ""And a knife!""

Scout: ""Ooh, big problem. I kill plenty of Spies. They're dime-a-dozen back-stabbin' scumbags. Like you! Ow. No offence.""

[Scout takes the butterfly knife out of Sniper's back, spinning it around before cutting his finger and dropping the knife. He puts the cut in his mouth.]

Spy: ""If you manage to kill them, I assure you, they will not like me.""

[Spy spins the knife much better than Scout, fancily closing it and handing it to Scout, who takes his cut out of his mouth.]

Spy: ""I am nothing, nothing, like the man loose inside this building.""

Scout: ""What are you? President of his fan club?""

[Soldier laughs behind Scout. Spy walks over to the windows next to the desk.]

Spy: ""No..""

[Spy turns back to Scout.]

Spy: ""That would be your mother!""

[Spy brings out a Manila folder. He slams it against the desk, and it has ""TOP SECRET, SCOUT'S MOM"" written on it. Multiple images of the RED Spy and BLU Scout's mother being intimate fly out of the folder and onto the desk. The camera shows us close ups of three of the images.]

Scout: [Stutters in shock.]

[Scout, Soldier and Heavy all look at the photos. Scout with confusion and anger, Soldier with interest and Heavy mostly uncaring, but a little shocked.]

Spy: ""Indeed, and now he is here to f**k us! So listen up, boy, or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today.""

[Spy grabs a cigarette from his case, Scout looks like he is ready to attack Spy, Heavy and Soldier are trading the images of Scout's Ma.]

Soldier: ""Oh!""

Scout: ""G-gimme that!""

[Scout begins to collect the images, taking them from Heavy and Soldier. Spy takes a drag from his cigarette and looks out the window at a map of the world.]

Spy: ""The Spy has already breached our defenses...""

[The camera changes to show the RED Spy running along a hallway. He hides behind a rock quickly, before tossing a Sapper at a BLU Sentry, destroying it, and shooting the Engineer.]

Engineer: ""Sentry down!""

[The Engineer falls through a door, dead, and the RED Spy shoots something off camera.]

[Cut back to the three BLU's in the intel room.]

Spy: ""You've seen what he's done to our colleagues!""

[The camera pans down to the deceased BLU Sniper before fading into this Snipers fight with the RED Spy. The Spy raises his knife, ready to backstab, but the Sniper hears him and defends himself with his rifle. The Spy kicks him into a wall, where Sniper grabs his Kukri, attempting to attack the Spy. The Spy dodges, but gets a slash on the Snipers left cheek. Sniper goes in for the attack, but Spy gets the best of him, backstabbing the Sniper. His body falls through the wall onto the ground below. Fight sounds are heard throughout the scene.]

[Cut back to the three BLU's.]

Spy: ""And worst of all, he could be any one of us.""

[Cut to the RED Spy fighting a BLU Medic. Spy gets a hold on him and disguises himself as the Medic. The disguised Spy hits the Medic, causing his glasses to fly into the air, and for the real Medic to fall to the ground, assumed dead. The Spy grabs Medic's glasses mid-air and puts them on.]

[Cut back to the three BLU's.]

Spy: ""He could be in this very room! He could be you. He could be me! He could even be-""

[Spy looks at the camera, but is cut off by his head being blown off. Soldier reloads his shotgun after shooting his teammate. Scout and Heavy look on in surprise. The images and the folder Scout was holding flies into the air.]

Scout: ""Woah, woah, woah!""

Heavy: ""Oh...""

Soldier: ""What? It was obvious! He was the RED Spy! Watch, he'll turn red any second now.""

[The camera shows Spy's foot, and Soldier nudges it with his shotgun.]

Soldier: ""Aaaany second now...""

[The camera changes to show Heavy and Soldier, who are crouching next to the Spy's body. They do not notice when the BLU Scout changes his demeanor to be much more unaffected by the murder of his teammate. The Scout looks around the room, to make sure no one is watching.]

Soldier: ""See! Red! Oh wait, that's blood...""

[The camera changes again, to be following the BLU Scout as he un-flicks the knife, slowly approaching the unsuspecting BLU's.]

Heavy: ""So... We still got problem.""

Soldier: ""Big problem...""

However, in the current day Team Fortress 2's main mode, the online matchmaking mode known as ""Casual Mode"" has been almost completely overrun with bots who play as The Sniper class and cheat to kill players from any distance instantly. These bots make about 70%~90% of Valve's casual servers unplayable at most times of the year and most times of the day. An abandoned game overrun by bots is one thing, but the Valve corporation continues to add microtransactions to the game to this day and massively profits off of this game through that and the exchange of in-game items through the Steam Market. I feel that it is immoral the sheer amount of money that Valve makes off of Team Fortress 2 while doing nothing about the bots ruining it's most popular mode on Valve's own servers.

I love Team Fortress 2, but I cannot in good faith recommenced it to anyone as long as Valve continues to do nothing about the bots in casual mode. I really hate to see such a beloved game left to rot.",1687092581,1687092581,False,50,10,0.6570395827293396,0,True,False,False

I hit 1000 Hours over a year ago, and even got a job (No Longer have that job) as an Administrator for a TF2 Community, And it was all thanks to my love for this game. 
I wont ever leave TF2, Its where I got friends, Had fun, Got a job, And this game saved me from suicide. I was so lonely in April 2020 when I stumbled across this game, I was ready to kill myself. 
One click on this game, And I was in heaven.
Thanks to this game I became a slightly popular Twitch Streamer, Had about 300 Followers on Social Media (Banned due to false accusations and drama.), And am now Elite Grade on my Casual Badge.
This game will be with me for the rest of my life, And If I die, Ill make sure I left TF2 Running.
While I have taken on more healthy hobbies (I'm a railfan and transit enthusiast nowadays.), I still enjoy playing a round of Team Fortress whenever I have the time.

Pros
- It's a timeless classic
- All the classes are balanced very well (except maybe for the Spy)
- Very skill based
- Top 10 on the Steam active players leaderboard (so there's a lot of people playing it)
- Very creative and welcoming community

Cons
- Lack of support from developers (last major update was 6 years ago!!)
- Steep learning curve
- Casual queue games are sometimes filled with aimbot sniper bots, but this never happens in Community Servers",1575330966,1686271627,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

1. Game has many cheaters/bug users. One-shots at full health (not sniper). Kills through floor with rockets, without taking damage and so on. I've seen VAC owners playing on VAC protected servers...
2. The game has many AFK players.
3. The game has no ping filter when you join ""Casual mode"" (despite the fact that wiki said that matchmaking should put you in a nearby located server). You can see ping 100+ often.
4. The game has many dumbasses and degenerates. Idiots that vote to kick you for no reason or as revenge. Idiots that don't try to bring the case back, and just troll teammates.
5. The game has many people who waste time writing dumb, childish messages. 
6. The game has many players that just want to dance whatever, instead of killing the enemy. It's ""funny"" once in a while, but not as often as it happens in TF2.
7. People trash talk in chat sometimes. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a class for mentally challenged kids.
8. The game has MANY furries and transformers. 
9. The micro-economy in TF2 is one of the worst I saw in games. Valve style. Loot boxes that require expensive keys to open and now weapon skins of different qualities...
10. Spy class.
11. I played on 2Fort in 70% of my matches. 10% was popular map with cart. The rest 20% was on different maps.
12. Trolls.
13. Menus/mode UI is bad. Server browser is outdated (hello 90s). Main menu has poor design. 

It reminded me of a quote from one movie. 

‚ÄúI See You Alone, Surrounded By Enemies, And It Breaks My Heart.‚Äù

I'm not saying that this applies to all players, but I think that bigger half of players are either A) Transformers, B) Have a questionable financial history (to say it politely), C) Have weak hardware, so they can't play more modern games (TF is a 2007 game), or combination of these. I mean you can have fun, sometimes, in certain scenarios... If you like cartoonish/Pixar graphics, very casual matchmaking and TF humor. The problem is that it's often not ""fun"" because of reasons above. If you plan to rent/host a server, use some balance mods (like class limit), set a connection filter and punish cheaters/trash talkers/degenerates, then the game will be fine. For a guy that just wants to play on a random server, it's not a lot of fun. To my deep disappointment (no, really), there is no known alternative to TF2. By alternative, I mean hero shooter with cartoonish graphics. Different classes, different modes. A game that you play to have fun, while still ACTUALLY TRYING TO KILL YOUR ENEMIES, without cheating/bugs etc. Overwatch 2 can be fun, but it has problems too. I'm not saying that making games is an easy job, but games like this one are a lot easier to make, than the one with huge detailed map, lots of cutscenes etc. A good in-game economy can bring a lot of money. Today we have an unintentional monopoly in the face of TF2. 
I hope that I made it clear why I play (possibly will still play...for some time) this game. 

To potential players - Avoid this game. Let it die. It's an old game with too many problems. The more I played it, the more problems I have found. It's not just bad as competitive game (I don't care), but also as casual game.",1677533070,1685726384,False,4,0,0.517309486865997314,0,True,False,False

     Pyro (CQC centered class) can use the scorch shot to flame you from across the map.
And not even aim is technically required to do that, since it's a splash damage based weapon.
Plus the afterburn does insane damage, please fix it.

     Sniper's exploitable skill ceiling and his balance issues (razorback, dds, quickscoping) makes him stupidly
powerful in comparison to the other 8 classes in this game, since it's a hassle to put a long-ranged focused
class in a game where literally everything excels at close-mid range. And as the years go by, people get better, and games get unplayable.

       Random crits are just unfun to play against, because of how its rampup works.
The more damage you deal..  well, equals the more damage you deal! Also, random bullet spray is not equally as bad but it's quite a little bit of a problem when it does affect gameplay.

       And Spy.. i know the class has been nerfed into oblivion already but please fix the ping problems associated with hitreg and hitboxes, and i think that's all of my complaints on TF2.

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1684873994,1684873994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, as time has passed, it has become apparent that the game falls short in several areas, ultimately leading to a disappointing experience for players.

One of the main issues with Team Fortress 2 is its lack of meaningful updates and support from the developers. Despite its initial popularity, the game has been plagued by a lack of new content and a slow response to fixing bugs and balancing issues. This lack of attention from the developers has resulted in a stagnant gameplay experience, with little incentive for long-term engagement.

Furthermore, the game's balance is a major concern. While the concept of different classes with unique abilities and roles is appealing, the execution is flawed. Some classes are vastly overpowered, leading to frustrating and unbalanced matches. This lack of balance not only hampers the enjoyment of the game but also discourages fair competition and strategic gameplay.

Another major drawback of Team Fortress 2 is the prevalence of hackers and cheaters. The game's lack of effective anti-cheat measures has allowed cheating to run rampant, resulting in an unfair and frustrating experience for legitimate players. This undermines the integrity of the game and drives away dedicated players who seek a fair and competitive environment.

Additionally, the game's overall performance and optimization have not aged well. Despite being over a decade old, Team Fortress 2 often suffers from technical issues, including crashes, lag, and poor server performance. These technical shortcomings detract from the gameplay experience and hinder the enjoyment of the game.

Lastly, the community itself can be toxic and unwelcoming. While every online game has its share of negative elements, Team Fortress 2 seems to have an elevated level of toxicity, with instances of harassment, bullying, and disrespectful behavior. This toxic environment can make it difficult for new players to feel comfortable and enjoy the game.

In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 fails to live up to its initial promise and falls short in several key areas. The lack of updates and developer support, imbalanced gameplay, prevalence of cheaters, technical issues, and toxic community all contribute to a disappointing experience. While the game may have had its shining moments in the past, it struggles to remain relevant and fails to provide a satisfying and enjoyable team-based shooter experience in its current state.",1684175609,1684175609,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 I WANT to like this game, I want to look at the scoreboard and see my name at the top. I want to win. I want a good K/D ratio, I want to feel like I supported my team, and to feel satisfied after a match. But I don't and I never will. I have over 660 hours in the game and I regularly lose. I get mad. I blame my team mates. I rage. I mald in chat. I change my class, and I still get killed. I get dominated by at least two players per match. in 660 hours and I should have learned SOMETHING but I still just barely outskill a fresh F2P. 

I'm not going to get good at this game, no matter how many more hours I put into this game. I'm just going to keep on losing and dying and getting mad and being salty. Instead of doing that, I'm going to uninstall the game, and try to not play it anymore. There is this small amount of naivety buried deep inside me that says if I just play for a little while longer, I'll get better, but that same voice said that same thing 100 hours ago.

TF2 is the game I play on Sundays when I'm feeling down and have a good time playing with other people when there isn't a horde of bots. First we have the recognizable characters the one that comes out of my mind first is the Heavy, the first class to be shown in the ""Meet the Team"" videos which are lore driven and comedy filled adventure with about 20 minutes of Meet the Team videos, my favorite is going to Meet the Spy not because I'm a Spy main I will say it I am a Huntsman main which are very rare I just find his mechanics to be very fun especially the hanging ragdoll corpses because this is the best game engine ever which is in Garry's Mod and it is Source! Second we have the cosmetics, because this game is free it is bound to have paid items, mainly are weapons, war paints, and weapons and much much more that I can't list, I know this is unnecessary but my steam accounts most expensive cosmetic is in Steam Market value would go to the Nuts and Bolts Wraith Wrap and in Market value so Marketplace . tf is the Medimedes which is very cool but again the prices for something like a golden frying pan is as much as your rent which makes me pissed to say at the least. The third thing is that the gameplay overall is good and well balanced if all the players are playing stock but playing with different weapons could make it unfair and a balancing nightmare for example the Rescue Ranger is a essential item for defensive engineer because the engineer can heal is buildings far away and it cost approximately close to a full one dollar in cash oh no I meant Steam Funds not real cash and speaking of which the in-game store ""The Mann-Co Store"" is dog water the prices of these cosmetics and weapons may sound like they're expensive but I've bought items in marketplace . tf and their prices are approximately 5 to 10 cents while something like the Desert Marauder for Sniper is 11 dollars while in marketplace it is 10 cents, very big difference between the Mann-co store and Marketplace . tf and weapons are even worse some weapons like the Righteous Bison first of all complete trash is about $1.30 or $2.00 which is a steal the items actual value is about 3 cents, very much a scam not in deception though. The last thing I want to talk about is the downsides I'm not listing every downside because I would be here for hours typing, first we have that there's a constant swarm of hacking bots which headshot across the border and kills all the people in the opposite of them and they try to kick innocent players out of the game which is downright terrible I doubt that there would be a fix for these bots because Valve would have to take down the cheating software so LmaoBox which is a big icon Valve took down CS:GO lottery websites basically gambling your money for stupid skins which are just textures on a weapon while Valve hasn't done a single thing to LmaoBox, they literately make you pay to have a bot which is not VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) detectable while the free one is VAC detectable. This is just horrible. Then a pretty niece topic is the ingame non cheating bots, the practice bots first of all the training for this game is horrible and doesn't even teach you the basics of Soldier everybody's main right now, it doesn't teach you about rocket-jumping, a essential aspect of Soldier for his slow mobility, so to say it they are limited with the maps you can do, first can't even play a underrated map, Hydro try to create a nav-mesh for the bots they don't even move at all the only gamemodes they can do is attack and defend which is only Dustbowl and Gorge which is abysmal, King of the Hill which doesn't even have my favorite King of the Hill map which is Harvest, and Payload and they don't even have support for my favorite map for payload which is Frontier so I have to generate a nav-mesh for the bots to navigate even then it isn't perfect and they can't by default do Capture the Flag so you have to generate a nav-mesh for them and they're AI is absolute garbage in their default maps all I can say is that they're vanilla AI is garbage. But there is a much better improvement to these bots like with Left 4 Dead and like that game you can use mods to improve their AI I highly recommend Bot-Overhaul by Showin it is amazing, because of this mod I play with bots all the time, first they have support for much much more maps and even gamemodes like the previously mentioned Capture the Flag and they have different weapons instead of stock weapons also they come with cosmetics that's how I get my ideas for cosmetics to get on the marketplace outside of the TF2 Wiki but I can say that sometimes they do get stuck on Badwaters second BLU spawn and it is mostly unfixable while the only positive I'll give to the vanilla bots is that they don't get stuck much in other maps I'll also say that Bot-Overhaul doesn't get much updates usually they are bug fixes but even then it doesn't persuade me from downloading the mod I'll also say that the installation process for the mod is complex for the first time but the more you get used to it the better you get also they have a tutorial for how to install the mod so if you don't now how to install the mod then look up for example on YouTube ""How to download Bot-Overhaul in TF2"" you also get results from the creator Showin who gives a good guide of how to install the mod but a another con I have is that it tanks performance don't have the maximum amount of bots for me I make it a 6v6 so it's fair and doesn't hurt my FPS as much this FPS problem is because the game is spawning bots with different weapons that aren't stock that can already tank performance but the worst of all for lower end computers like mine is that it spawns bots with cosmetics, already in Bot-Overhaul and TF2 in all there is 100's of cosmetics and already having about 31 bots with different weapons and cosmetics each time can tank performance. But this is the end for my long review about Team Fortress 2 but overall I would rate it a 8/10 for really good gameplay when playing stock but is full of bots so I would recommend to go on community servers which isn't infested with hacker bots I mainly play in Achievement Engineer servers from LA but this is the end of my review and bye.",1683594750,1683594750,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Soldier: ""A RED Spy is in the base!?""

[Intruder Alert begins to play. The Soldier reaches from off-screen and pulls a Shotgun off a rack of weapons. Cut to the Soldier dashing down the stairs and through the 2Fort sublevel while saying ""Hut, Hut, Hut!"" with every step he takes]

The Administrator: ""Protect the briefcase!""

Soldier: ""We need to protect the briefcase!""

[Camera pans to reveal the BLU Scout trying to open the code-locked 'Briefcase Room' door]

Scout: ""Yo, a lil' help here!?""

[The Soldier pushes the Scout aside and begins to 'decode' the combination]

Soldier: ""All right, all right, I got it. Stand back son. 1, 1, 1, umm... 1!""

Scout: Let's go, let's go-

[BLU Heavy comes around the corner, Sasha in hand, charging towards the Scout and Soldier]

Heavy: ""INCOMING!""

[Heavy shoulder-barges the door, destroying it. The three of them are sent tumbling and screaming into the Intelligence Room. The Scout reaches the desk to discover the briefcase is perfectly safe]

Scout: [while screaming, he notices the briefcase] ""AAAAAHHHH- Hey, it's still here!""

Heavy: ""-AAAAalright then.""

Spy: ""Ahem.""

[Camera zooms in to reveal the BLU Spy, with the BLU Sniper's corpse over one shoulder]

Spy: ""Gentlemen.""

[Meet the Spy' Title Card]

[Cut back to the Spy, carrying the dead Sniper towards the desk]

Spy: ""I see the briefcase is safe.""

Soldier: ""Safe and sound, mm-hmm.""

Scout: ""Yeah, it is!""

Spy: ""Tell me... did anyone happen to kill a RED Spy on the way here?""

[The other three BLUs shake their heads and shrug]

Spy: ""No? Then we still have a problem.""

[He deposits the Sniper's body on the desk, revealing a bloody Knife in his back]

Soldier: ""...and a knife.""

[The Scout approaches and removes the knife]

Scout: ""Oooh, big problem. I've killed plenty of Spies; they're dime-a-dozen back-stabbing scumbags - like you!""

[The Scout attempts to manipulate the knife like the Spy, only to cut himself on the finger and drop it]

Scout: ""Ow! No offense.""

Spy: ""If you managed to kill them, I assure you, they were not like me."" [The Spy deftly retrieves the knife and flicks it shut, handing it back to the Scout] ""And nothing... nothing like the man loose inside this building.""

Scout: ""What're you? President of his fan club?""

[The Soldier and Heavy chuckle]

[The Spy turns to face the Scout]

Spy: ""No... that would be your mother!""

[The Spy reveals a folder and slaps it down on the table, revealing several compromising photographs of the RED Spy and the Scout's mother]

Scout: [stammers out of shock and disbelief]

Spy: ""Indeed, and now he's here to f**k us! So listen up boy, or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today.""

[[[Right Behind You]] plays]

[The Soldier and Heavy examine the photographs. The Heavy leans over and shows the Soldier one photo in particular]

Soldier: ""Oh!""

[The Scout frantically retrieves the photos as the Spy lights and smokes a cigarillo in the foreground]

Scout: ""Gimme that!""

Spy: ""This Spy has already breached our defenses...""

[Fade to the RED Spy, creeping through the Hydro tunnels. He pauses at a corner, as the camera pulls back to reveal a BLU Level 3 Sentry Gun with its Engineer. He slides an Sapper across the floor, disarming and destroying the Sentry Gun immediately]

Engineer: ""Sentry Down!""

[The BLU Engineer throws his Wrench down and frantically reaches for his Pistol, only to have the Spy shoot him in the head with the Revolver. The dead Engineer crashes through a door and the Spy steps over him and fires at a target off-screen]

[Cut back to the BLU Intelligence Room. The BLU Spy leans over the dead Sniper, gesturing frantically.]

Spy: ""You've seen what he's done to our colleagues!""

[Flashback to the BLU Sniper, now alive and sniping from a dusty attic. The RED Spy creeps up on him and steps on a creaking floorboard, alerting the Sniper, who engages the Spy with the Kukri. A struggle ensues, and the Sniper is ultimately backstabbed]

[Cut back to BLU Intelligence Room]

Spy: ""And worst of all, he could be any one of us...""

[Fade to the RED Spy fighting a BLU Medic, armed with a Bonesaw]

Medic: ""Raus, raus!""

[The Spy breaks the Medic's arm, disarming him. Close-up on the Spy's face as he disguises as the Medic, sans spectacles]

Medic: [gasps] ""Nein...""

[The Spy kills the Medic with a well-placed chop to the throat, knocking off his spectacles, which he catches and wears, completing his disguise]

[Cut back to BLU Intel Room. The BLU Spy looks frantic]

Spy: ""He could be in this very room! He could be you! He could be me! He could even be-""

[The Spy is cut off as his head explodes violently. The camera switches to the Soldier, Shotgun in hand, with a confused Heavy and a panicked Scout]

Scout: ""Whoa, whoa, whoa!""

Heavy: ""Oh!""

Soldier: ""What? It was obvious!"" [The Soldier pumps his Shotgun, discarding the spent shell.] ""He's the RED Spy! Watch, he'll turn red any second now...""

[The Soldier and Heavy approach the dead Spy, with The Soldier prodding the Spy's foot with his Shotgun]

Soldier: ""Any second now... See? Red! Oh, wait... that's blood.""

[The Scout lingers behind, his expression sinister. He approaches the Soldier and Heavy, retrieving the knife he pocketed earlier, and flicking it open easily. As he approaches, he flickers and melts, revealing himself to be the RED Spy]

Heavy: ""So, we still got problem...""

Soldier: ""Big problem... all right, who's ready to go find this Spy?""

Spy: ""Right behind you.""

[Team Fortress 2 ending flourish music plays, with the stabbing of the Soldier and Heavy punctuating the beat of the tune.]

[Petite Chou-Fleur plays]

[Fade to the scattered photos of the Scout's mother. The RED Spy retrieves one of them and smiles wistfully]

Spy: ""Ahh... ma petite chou-fleur.""

Sure Overwatch does the competitive scene better, because their game is designed around it and that's all it is.  Valve really did drop the ball in the regard and could use a better built in ranking system / competitive scene support. (Just like nintendo ironically)

But that's all OW has, sometimes you just want to jump in and have some fun instead of getting screamed at on voicecomms by some 13 year old because you picked McCree.  Where's the fun 20vs20 servers you can just jump in and mess around in?

If you've played this for at least decent while, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Other contenders for the title of GOAT simply lack something this game has in spades, such as infinite replayability, a strong playerbase that is still hitting over 100k players daily even almost 16 years after release, and no other game has a class as fun and as unique as Spy. The fun you'll have and friends you'll make are all part of what makes this game so genuinely amazing. I love this game like an old friend; one I may not have seen for years on end at times, but I can still come back and to talk to them for hours on end like not a day has gone by since we last spoke, and treasure every single moment I spend with them.  I spent at least half of my hours of playtime running the game on a piece of crap laptop that got maybe 23 FPS on all lowest settings while using the lowest resolution available, as that's how dedicated I am to this game. I may not know what true love is when it comes to people, but damn it, I sure as hell know what it's like to truly love a game unconditionally with every individual fibre of my being. If or when this game dies, I will cry infinitely more for this game than I will at my own father's funeral. I fucking love you, Team Fortress 2.

This can lead to frustration for players who feel that their preferred playstyle is not viable or that they are at a disadvantage in certain situations.

Additionally, the game's graphics and visuals may feel outdated, as the game was released over a decade ago and has not undergone significant updates in this regard.

Finally, the game's community is toxic and unwelcoming, which can detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.

A few years later, Valve begins to neglect the game. Mann Vs Machine is probably the last really good update for the game. The matchmaking update made the UI just... atrocious to navigate. Despite criticism, the community server browser is just packed away and hidden in a corner still. The community server browser is still the same code that Half-Life 1 MP uses. 

The source code for TF2 gets leaked. Some talented people see this as an opportunity to time machine TF2 back to where it used to be. A time before the balance changes and cosmetics that pollute the original vision of silhouettes always being recognizable. Some choose to extensively mod TF2 into a new vision, unrestricted by what current TF2 mod creators are limited by. There's even a project to port TF2 to Source 2. Unfortunately, law is absolute and does not distinguish intent very well. Those projects were temporarily shut down while lawyers had to figure out how to allow creative people freedom, but not give the same rights to someone with worse intent. Unfortunately the damage was done and most of these projects have a barely living population.

TF2 exists as a tragedy in 2023. Official servers are ran over by bots. It is to the point that if you see a Sniper, they're most likely a cheater or a bot. This isn't even ""wow that Sniper main is so good they get a flattering amount of cheatcusations."" This is obvious cheating, where a single Sniper walks into the open, spins like a top, and perfectly headshots every opposing player around them. 

The overwhelming majority of the TF2 community agrees that botting/cheating is bad and there is a gentleman's agreement to kick those cheating from the game. Unfortunately, cheating is so rampant that you are likely to boot a cheater, just to get a new one popping up in its place. Eventually, the players reach critical mass. They don't want to deal with it, so the victims start to leave. Then cheaters fill in for legitimate players on the other team and then they have to play whack-a-mole, too. 

It's a horrible problem that has infested this once beloved game for years.",1453862156,1679921395,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's free to play, try it out.

The majority of players that start playing are children and develop poor spending habits from the free-to-play model. So be careful not to end up like the rest of the people who became gambling addicts or spent over $1000 on the game because they couldn't help themselves. Or if you do spend a lot, have no regrets.
