These two people need to reflect on what they did with this, and now the trademark won't get another chance.

5 gigabytes.... somehow they managed to make a game that is worse than the original, which is 775 megabytes.

The developers are the ones at fault here, they created a project based on nostalgia with little to no actual coding experience. To make up for it the built it in Unity or whatever off the shelf engine they could buy.

They're artists, all they did was make the art cartoon-ish, simulated the base mechanics of the original game, and pushed it out with pretty much no quality control. They released a couple updates for game-breaking bugs, and now aren't communicating at all. This was a grab and go exploiting early gaming nostalgia.

Predators on the map? Police no longer kill them, and they also like to rubberband for seconds at a time, leading to some rather funny visual bugs that were ""fixed"" in the last update. Not.

Enjoy building monuments and watching your workers build them? Too bad you're rather distracted by the workers not rendering on the monument because the bricks cover them.

Remember the combat and military in the original? Yeah.... it's gone.

Remember, the devs aren't coming back to fix this. It became abandonware in a tenth of the time of the original.",1709051639,1709051639,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I like this new embodiment of the game. Triskel have faithfully honoured the original, whilst upgrading the visuals and updating some of the systems. Nothing will ever quite replace the original Pharaoh for me, but this rendition retains the charm of the original, and gets my thumbs up.

Still loving it. I've been working my way through the main campaign, which I haven't even finished yet, and there are all the custom missions to do as well. I've chosen to do my first run of the game with Global Labour pool turned on. It makes managing workers far easier, but most of all I'm finding that it allows for much more freedom in designing beautiful cities with layouts that make more sense to me, without trying to fit little huts in hear and there to feed workers to all the buildings.

It is more accessible due to difficulty options, and much (but not all) the newly recorded music is an improvement over the original. I've enjoyed playing it. 
However I can't recommend the game. It has some crippling monument bugs that leave you unable to finish pyramids. This means many campaign missions are impossible to finish without cheats.

Apart from this game-breaking bug it has two significant weaknesses: One is the UI, which is needlessly compact. Modern indecision and view-area fetishry has stowed helpful buttons and nice, stylized menus away at the edges where they are hopelessly difficult to discern. 1/10.
The other is the military threat, which has been dumbed down to mobile-game-esque standoffs between yours and the raiding armies (and navies). Completely fine by me, but this renders many of the campaign missions virtually meaningless, since wall layout and troop management were key factors in city design.

A less vital bug is that army recruitment does not seem to work across rivers, so you always have to have recruiters and forts on one side only.

Like:
- 99% of the gameplay is from the original version which was already great
- There are various customization options to suit each player's playstyle
- The music has been updated to fit the modern era
- Affordable price

Dislike:
- The game is easier and may not be as fun as the original version
- The graphics are more cartoonish
- The city feels lifeless
- The UI is inconvenient to use
- A combat system that is not exciting at all

Recommendation:
I recommend buying this game
This game is suitable for players who enjoy city-building games with a focus on resource management
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s time for me to revise my review. This time, I decided to buy the game again and try it out after several patches. The first thing I noticed was that the game had improved so much that I had to change my recommendation from ""not to buy"" to ""must buy"".

Since this is a remake, the game system is 99% taken from the original version, which was already an excellent game. But I’m not sure if I like the other 1% that this version changed. The game became easier and less fun, but still enjoyable as the original. The graphics were redesigned to be more cartoonish, which I personally disliked the most in this game. The game still lacked some charm, a combat system that is not exciting at all and felt that the city was lifeless, which the original did very well. Another thing I didn’t like was the UI of the game, which looked more comfortable but was less convenient to use. The thing I liked the most was the ability to customize the modes to suit the preferences of each player. The music of the remake version felt better than the original. It sounded more pleasant and modern, but didn’t lose the ancient Egyptian vibe.

In conclusion, this game is good, maybe not as good as the original, but good enough to make you not regret spending money even if you buy it at full price.

I went back and wanted to do a re-review. Pity I can't keep the old so you have a reference. Basically game went out superunpolished, many bugs, lacking original functionallity. In Beta.

Now it is far more consistent and tons of QoL improvements (map design, scrolling, dunno moving around the game and menus and the options is just very very nice now). Also it doesn't break that often (city sentiment overreacting, gods throwing money 24/7) and it is very well responsive.

Still some cons in this playthrough.

1. Difficulty. There is no challenging difficulty. In hard it is just very easy. I honestly thought I was playing on easy. Once you set up the trade is a breeze. Also it was funny to see 20 prosperity with 100k in the bank. I know it is related to house lvls but come on, say it in the overseer.
2. Broken stats. I just tested a military map (the one you have 2 forts starting) and left the city for 6 years. Without doing anything from the start. Thousands of plagues, enemy's destroying the city, lack of workers, no food. Oh well the city still ""idiolize me like a god"" and people still wanted to come despite tons of diseases. And the gods where fine :)
3. Lack of balancing in some maps. You easily get everything you need for your economy but the goal is 4k habitants so you basically need 1000 police stations to keep unemployment low :). Or why I choose all the time the one mission that has less buildings: NOTHING to do if you rely on imports. Just waiting for the import cap each year and pray the pharaoh gives me something. I feel there's no effort in creating a new campaing that fits the new reality. Doesn't make sense to just copypaste the old designs and not give new maps or stuff.
4. I would love to have custom maps more accessible through steam. As a TF2 random maps enjoyer, usually the community is what pushes forward the creativity. So at least make it easy to get them through steam.
5. The thing I hate THE MOST BY FAR. is to not have a ""silent"" mode. Like wtf listening to a ""clink"" every 10 seconds because I have 2% of unemployment. COME ON. It's great you can now avoid getting the fullscreen, but man.
6. Some poor details. Still I can hear the hunters' arrows from everywhere. If you let the ""battles"" play on it glitches and you basically listen to arrows indefinitely until you click off the battle. Also what you see and the ""numbers"" are unmatched.
7. Some strange features like only having an entry point to a building (so if you connect 2 different roads to something, only one works as entry), 0 feedback on why a city buys everything from trade and some others don't?. 
8.PLEASE TELL ME WHAT DO I NEED TO BUILD THE MONUMENTS AT THE BEGINNING. Not AFTER I already worked the ground for many years for gods sake. I need to plan ahead


It's unthinkable to play the old one (it was too buggy) but this one still feels like the bare minimum has been done. This one is enjoyable but still the frustrating parts (sound design was better in the original and ""yeah spend 25 in game years just doing festivals"") are not even tried to solve.

[h3] My original negative review [/h3]
I love the original Pharaoh, played it for thousands of hours at least, I wanted the very best from this remake, alas, it has many issues (also perma-banned me in the forums for criticizing the demo);
- UI is generic and weak
- OST cover is pretty bad, I need the originals
- No debrief voice-over, no cinematics between chapters...
- No minimap, no rotation...
- Cartoony graphics are tolerable, but some visual glitches are too annoying: things clipping over, characters disappearing, I hate not being able to see monument construction details properly, cannot see workmen, or they all stack up in a single spot, this was an issue in the original game as well.
- Really useless battle mechanic, makes defensive structures obsolete, a shame...
- Cannot stop predators, no cop or magistrate kill hippos, crocs, etc. So had to disable them all...
- Worst of it all, a ton of bugs: 
   ~ ferries don't work sometimes, 
   ~ enemy attack while on speed 5 might just not happen, and break the game pausing automatically at the end of every month
   ~ closing world map sometimes make things unclickable, you have to open & close the world map again to fix
   ~ pop feedback can be really negative incorrectly, like they say there is a labor shortage while I have like %20 unemployment, similarly for culture rating feedback, I have 100% mortuary coverage, it asks me to increase mortuary coverage...?
   ~ immigration can stop randomly, I have 5% unemployment, all houses at same level around level 10 or so, with 8% tax, and above average wages. So even in a perfect city it can randomly say, poor housing, or high taxes, or high unemployment, should maybe give what is expected vs what is the situation in the city in the description there. (e.g. ""Taxes are high, it should be at least 2%"")
   ~ Steam achievements seem to be bugged, I didn't get curses from all five gods, I didn't build all types of monuments, I didn't get blessings from all gods, but got their achievements nonetheless...

I liked the QoL improvements the most, global labor feature is +++, port trade settings ++, path finding seems to work better ++, inundation doesn't kill farm output transporters++++",1676967683,1707681660,True,0,0,0.857334434986114502,4,True,False,False

In campaign, Abedju, trader caravans suddenly started just bypassing stating that ""this city trades nothing"" despite stocks full of beer and barley and export orders (export when over ""amount"") at trading councelor screen.

Alas.
Updade: found how to reproduce. After building second ferry landing across the Nile traders beginning their boycot ). Probably they protest to my aggresive expantion. After removing secong ferry landing the bug disapears.
Hope devs will fix it.
Update 2: After another 10 hours playing only one issue noticed - ingame time flow is bound to fps. When fps is 30 it feels like monthes are passing by about 2 times slower that at 60. But game itself (units speed etc) remains the same. Wierd.
Everything else looks ok.

Also I wanted to write my new review after I finished the campaign part of the game but I just couldn't wait any longer to change my thumb :)

Pro(s)
 + all things mentioned above in the old review.
 + I'm probably among the very few people who actually likes the new combant system!!! in the old one I could never predict and needed to read the walkthrough
 + the old bugs that made the game unplayable were fixed I like that the devs listened and fixed the bugs well most of them.
+ I'm not sure about what the people mean about the culture advsor and the stuff but I liked it that I need to use my braincells to figure it out how to make my cluster of homes better.
+ the wild animals are not that annoying anymore + but still unkillable
+I have the minimap

Con(s)
- Strangely nothing comes to mind ...
-I encountered some bugs but they were minor and nothing comes to mind (at 4:00 am in the morning)

""So everybody starts with how much they loved the original game I'am also a big fan of it. I loved it was fascinating and hard. I can only say that you should buy this game but wait a couple of month so they can fix the bugs especially the game braker ones then start playing (same thing happened to the last Heroes game)

So lets start with the pros:
 - nice graphics, i love it.
 - the game speed is also good for me.
 - the new game mechanics that I don't need to build near to my settlements.
 - intros

CONS:
 - Basically I'm starting the middle kingdom first mission when I choose waset I could not get my prosperity rating up to 45 (stuck at 44) / while in Thinnis the game literally broke when the egyiptian army tried to invade my city in 2005 BC they never invade and the game pauses every month so it's unfinishable  (I'm going to uninstall the game and forget it for a couple of month until they fix it to a playable quality)
 - Mini-Map! I need it so I can plan carefully !
 - It would be great that someone could kill the wild animals either the police/hunter/military in my maps
 - yep sometimes my walkers talking about things that are not true but I can live with that""

There are a lot of bugs. I find myself constantly deleting and rebuilding buildings to trigger their functions. It also lacks some basic modern city builder capabilities that we have grown used to. Such as resource management and worker management. So instead, I have to build storage buildings dedicated to one or two resources in an attempt to limit resource production to a certain number. You are also limited by the maps for what you can build. As far as I can tell, there isn't a single map where you can build every structure available. 

The recruiters are a nice concept. But they are completely random instead of pathed to go to the nearest house. This means you will have to build very simplistic designs.

Except the only enhancements are some graphics and some quality of life type things. Other than that, this game is an incredible mess of bugs, even on some core functionality. In my opinion this makes it unplayable. 
Two major bugs that made me just throw my hands up:
- In the mission where they teach you to trade, the traders never work. I tried everything, and eventually had to use a cheat code to skip that mission... lo and behold in the next scenario the trade works just fine. 
- A few scenarios later you're placed on a river bank with crocodiles. In the original game, the constable attacks the crocodiles. There is no way to kill the crocs in this version apparently. One forum post on the subject indicated from the developer that you should just turn predators off for now. Wtf kind of response is that? 

On another note, they completely changed how the military works. It's just a numbers game, now... There's no deploying troops across the desert to intercept the invaders. Now you just build giant barracks and the more barracks/troops you have, the better chance of winning against invaders. 

So of the four or five scenarios I played, I'm left using cheats to skip a mission, or disabling functions of the game.
So disappointed with this. I tried to get a refund, but because it took me an hour or two of fiddling with the trade mission, and attempts to overcome the crocs, I was past Steam's refund window.

Zeus and Pharaoh rank up there as some of the most memorable games I've played ever. The soundtracks alone and the ambient sounds made it so much fun. The games were created in such an idiosyncratic fashion as to include humour and barbs in gameplay, the likes of which have frankly disappeared since the heyday of Sierra

Pharaoh: a new era isn't the same game as the one we all played 20 years ago. We need to stop comparing this to the original out of nostalgia because we'll never get back what we once had. Same goes for the jagged alliance series. 

The main gripe I have about this game is that the characters are far too cartoonish for my liking. What stands out about this game is the sound and the music which I find to be of very good quality.

Other than that the game plays all right. It first came off as a mobile looking game but after a while I sort of accepted this and started to play. A decent amount of updates have followed.

I held off giving a positive review because of the lack of level editor but now that it's there, no reason to wait anymore. I do wish they'd make the Steam Workshop available with it though so we can share our maps with other people and vice versa directly within steam.

The game has its flaws though.
I can't say I'm a big fan of the overall animations and style of the characters. While the art for the buildings is nice overall and very faithful, the characters are far from it. They suffer from the classic ""puppet"" animations that plagues a lot of 2D digital art. I do wish they'd at the very least use something like Spine for their 2D Animation.

War is now a numbers game rather than a realtime event on the map. As long as you have full forts you'll probably win. As well, the commerce tools are glitched and do not work if you let your overseers decide export and import rates. For example if you want to export all surplus goods, you have to set it to specifically export over 0. Commerce is how you make money in this game so that feature being broken is unfortunate. By far the worst thing is you automatically lose if you get to -5k deben. In the original you simply could not buy anything else and had to trade and tax your way out of the hole to make a comeback.

I need my regular dose of this game regardless so I have played about 50 hours and taken these changes as an extra challenge - I'm done with the first two eras. However a significant chunk of that time must be from simply waiting for monuments to finish building for eons after I have completed the other goals, racked up enormous amounts of deben, upgraded all the living conditions as much as possible, paid my citizens 20db over the minimum wage, and gotten up to make a sandwich.

The original had a more ""real people"" art style, where the people of your city walking around were drawn to be more like that of a realistic style, now they look like a cartoon. While it has its own charm part of the charm of the old one was because it kinda made you feel like you were playing a game like the episode in Stargate Atlantis ""S3 E15: The Game"" but without the consequences of the ""Game"" featured in that episode.

TL;DR Play it if you like city builders, its a neat game and you can end up spending hundreds of hours playing it.",1702325362,1702325362,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Pharaoh: A New Era introduces notable quality of life changes that enhance the overall gaming experience. These improvements contribute positively to the gameplay and make it more enjoyable.

Bad:
One drawback of the game is the cartoonish depiction of characters. Some players might find this less appealing, especially when comparing it to the more realistic characters in the older version of the game. The user interface (UI) may come across as designed for a younger audience, which might not align with the preferences of all players.

Possible Changes in the Future:
A suggestion for improvement would be to introduce an option that allows players to switch between the cartoonish style and a more realistic depiction. This would provide players with the flexibility to choose a visual style that better suits their preferences, addressing the concern of those who miss the realism of the older game.",1701948363,1701948363,True,3,0,0.491842418909072876,0,True,False,False

I've been having a blast and so far have only run into one bug that was easy to work around (except the military system, see below).

Launch issues aside, the remake has a lot of improvements to the classic experience without sacrificing the aesthetic and simple genius of the original. Some of the new features include an option for a global labor pool like Zeus and Emperor, the ability to toggle what goods a Dock will accept, a ""flat mode"" view to hide obstructing buildings, and even a way to fix to the inevitable ""graying of Egypt"" problem that used to force the player to delete and remake whole neighborhoods. Overall, it seems like the developers were fans of the original Pharaoh who were very familiar with the game's dated frustrations, which are much reduced in this version.

My only real issue is the visually bugged new military system. Instead of awkwardly commanding your soldiers and ships to fight on the map, the battles automatically play out in front of you on a separate screen. This is a good [i] idea [/i] since combat was the clunkiest and most annoying feature of the original game, but the whole mechanic is currently messed up and the units will just run past each other. [b] This is purely a visual bug [/b] however, and you'll be given the correct results in the end.

I miss the golden days of Sierra so bad, and seeing this game that I played for years getting a remaster from such a dedicated group of people warms my heart so much.

So far haven't had any issues or bugs compared to the original, and the seeing the ""final product"" of the OST (which is my favorite part of any game) made me extremely happy and nostalgic. I watched the videos from when the developers were recording and mixing the ""new"" soundtrack and I got a little skeptical about it, but I must say the OST brings the same feels.

The [b]main difference(s)[/b] for me was the ""cartoonish"" style in some of the art, but that also made me appreciate the work that went into it, instead of simply ""re-scaling"" the old one, and gives the ""New Era"" a lot more character, the different keybindings for the Overseers, and the fact that ""out-of-the-box"" I couldn't really rotate the camera's orientation to N, S, E, W, but apart from that, everything feels right at home.

Also, as an ""OG"" player, I felt like the Tutorial forcing you to place buildings instead of telling you you need them and letting you choose where to place them was kinda meh, but I'm not against it, since it's only in the first mission really.

Very little has been changed from the original besides updated graphics and interface controls (and some very controversial changes to the military system), which do an excellent job of modernizing the game without losing the spirit. This update also includes the Cleopatra DLC that was originally released back in the day.

If you liked the original then buying this is a no-brainer. The old 1999 game has a lot of trouble running on modern machines (especially modern monitors), and this remake takes the exact same gameplay experience and gives it a breath of new life. Some people gripe about the simplified military system, and while I personally prefer the original I definitely understand the design choice to change it. And tbh it didn't make that much of a difference on my experience either way.

If you've never played the original I still recommend it, but with the asterisk that much of the gameplay is now considered ""standard city builder"" and your enjoyment may depend on how much you like the genre. It does have a few interesting twists that still set it apart even against modern games:

1) The flooding Nile, which changes season by season, refreshing the fertility of your land but also cutting off roads and parts of your city.
2) The gods, who need constant affirmation through shrines and festivals because their whims can affect things like the mood of the citizenry, or the amount of flooding next year.
3) The huge monuments, which are very satisfying to slowly watch come together block by block as you progress.

Also, unlike most city sims, the mission levels are genuinely satisfying and well made. They do a great job of introducing and justifying new mechanics at an appropriate rate, while also stepping through the real life history of ancient Egypt.

Lastly, I've heard the game was pretty buggy on release but that has not been my experience so I believe most of it is fixed. I found one minor bug after a few hours of playing but I was really on the lookout for it and it didn't really affect anything.

Long story short: good game. If you like this kind of game at all, definitely grab it. If you're a little hesitant just wait for a sale and it will be worth it.",1701072755,1701073590,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The only thing that is different is the fighting.  In the original the battles were done in your city and you had to put up walls, towers, and have your infantry/archers positioned to intercept the invading army.  In this version the fighting takes place in a pop up window with no tactics. It's rather plain unfortunately.  

However, this doesn't take away from the amazing resource management style that dominates the gameplay.  In fact some of the interface options and tools they have added make the game better and easier to refine your management style.  

Overall still one of the best resource management games out there that is challenging and interesting in the way the city unfolds with it's demands of items and cultural needs. definitely a favourite that stands the test of time!",1700938204,1700938204,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having played the original back ages ago on my old Windows 98 machine as a kid, and again (with the FullHD patch) on my Windows 7 machine as a student, I'm glad I get to experience a new and improved version on Windows 11 today.

That out of the way, here's my initial thoughts (having played and completed the campaign up to ""Men-nefer""):

+ New voice over (it is professional and sounds very much like the original - in German at least)
+ New options that allow you to customize the way you build and play the game (the default feels very natural as a transition from the original)
+ The new global worker pool is very easy to get used to. Not having to wait for the walker to find workers in houses is definitely an improvement! This is optional (and not the default) for all the purists out there.
+ 4k resolution support
+ You can easily move between the game and your second monitor, as well as alt-tab (this is great to refer to guides or for streamers)
+ You can not only name your family but choose from one of about 10 avatars to represent it (very minor, but appreciated nonetheless - you can see the icon at the top right while you play)
+ Animated main menu featuring the Nile and small ships
+ Interesting steam achievements and trading cards (if you're into one of these things)
~ New way to locate buildings in the side bar (you can pretty easily find everything, but it is a little annoying you cannot hide the tooltips which tend to get in the way a lot - they'd be better at the bottom of the screen in a fixed location)
~ New way the flood plain gets flooded. It is now a wave, and doesn't creep forward tile by tile like in the original.
~ New intro video (the style is similar to the Egypt movie by Disney about the biblical story if you've watched that)
- No campaign video when I started the first mission (will there be some in the future? I'll edit this later)
- When starting the game you can't click on the big three game mode selections (campaign, single missions, and loading save games) to proceed, but have to use the ""Proceed"" button below them (minor UX flaw, but it is also present for the Dynasty choice). During actual game play I had no similar issues so far though.
- The ""Hide"" keyboard shortcut does not close the menus, overseers, etc. As far as I know it does nothing. You can only hide menus and popups by right clicking, pressing ""Escape"" brings up the menu, which is a little annoying if you expect it to close the popup. This will take some getting used to, but could've been prevented if the option worked as I thought it would? Why not have escape close popups and bing up the menu only if there are none of those left? Clunky.
- The ""Rends l'argent !"" achievement is bugged. I paid myself like a Pharaoh in the ""Men-nefer"" campaign mission until I had over 15000 debens, but it didn't unlock.
- You cannot read the statement about your reputation on the politics overseer screen. It is cut off and doesn't even display a whole line.
- If I recall correctly, there was a score which was displayed at the end of each mission in the original game, but it is missing in this remake. Missed feature.

Several changes were made, some for the better, IMO. These include a flat view of buildings, which was formerly resolved by being able to turn the map 360° in the original Pharaoh. One can also keep track of the number of temples for the gods on a given map, as well as the last festival thrown for that god; something not present in the original Pharaoh. Most pleasurable of all (for me at least) is the ability to key in values like import/export goods. In the original Pharaoh, one could only click to achieve the desired results. 

Asides from P:ANE soundtrack, which I understand was remade with input from Keith Zizza, the original Pharaoh's composer, I'm also amazed at the fact that Triskell managed to put in additional dialogue for the citizens. I'm unsure if they were always present in the game, if Triskell managed to recover some unused dialogue, or even if they tracked down the original V/As to add more lines. At either rate, it was surprising to hear lines I've never encountered before in the original Pharaoh.
Initally shy about purchasing the game when it was first released, due to the mixed reviews, I decided to wait for almost a year. As far as I can tell, it paid off. I have no complaints about P:ANE. At the most, its build menu threw me off a bit since it's disctinct from the original Pharaoh. But I managed to gather my wits in time.

Those of you like me who enjoyed the Impression Games' city-building series, don't hesitate to get P:ANE. No regrets, surely.

OLD REVIEW
I played this game for countless years prior to this ""remaster"" being made. Let me very clear: there is not enough here to warrant a remaster. The game is nearly identical. Oh there are some UI changes - some for good, others not so much, but the biggest reason why I cannot recommend this remaster - despite my numerous attempts to give it the benefit of the doubt - is due to the numerous bugs and glitches that simply have not been fixed by the devs.

You can read through the various change-logs about what they have fixed, and they have done an admirable job of trying to get this game to a working state, because when released, it was nearly unplayable. The list of things that are STILL not fixed:

1. Inability to turn off production of any industry that is a farm or related to a farm (like straw for example).
2. Inability to turn off production to fishing wharves
3. Farms that randomly and unpredictably go unworked - despite an abundance of work camps - resulting in the player being forced to destroy the work camps and rebuild them. This occurs primarily on Sandbox missions from what I can tell.
4. Entirely too many negative events
5. Despite lowering the population requirements and spreading out the love for industry and services, it is still nearly impossible to maintain a 5-8% unemployment rate, and you are constantly being forced to build slums to provide labor.
6. The labor mechanic is simply NOT FUN. It is an utter pain to manage and requires countless micromanagement to get right. 
7. It's 2023. ""Walkers"" are a thing of the past for simulation games like this. In 2003 when I played this, it was fine. In 2023, let us set a range where our workers will go. For maps where space is a premium, it is needed.

The game simply is not fun. I have given it plenty of time. I only wish I could play the old version now instead of this (no longer have my CD, lost it long ago). There is not enough different here to warrant buying this version, and the devs didn't add much of anything new to the game. 

The ONLY change that I think was a good one was the change in how the military and battles work. No longer are you required to manually move your troops across the land, now you just need to find a place to build forts and the battles are fought in a mini-game. This removes the tedious nature of moving troops around a city, especially cities with lots of water.",1682219430,1700636913,True,0,0,0.531421422958374023,0,True,False,False

It's a charming old school city builder with 2D isometric visuals and roads at straight angles. It can't compete with deeper games such as Cities Skyline or Frostpunk, but it plays its hand well: the Egyptian theme is very well developped. 

Towering monuments can be built using inordinate amounts of time, material and manpower. There's a pantheon of five gods (Osiris, Ra, Seth, Bast and Ptah) to worship by building temples and running religious festivals. Like in real life the Nile is the key to prosperity. Wells and clay pits require to be dug near water. Farms need to be built on flood plains or irrigated by ditches linked to a water lift pumping from the river. People and goods can be ferried from one bank to the other. Ships from distant cities stop at your docks to trade. 

The remaster blows some dust off the original game by introducing a range of quality-of-life tweaks: an unlimited zoom out, building copypasting, and new gameplay toggles like the global worker pool and the fixed worker-to-inhabitant ratio instead of the ageing system.

Since the game is cute and bloodless I've played it with my 5 year old.

However, after the patches it received, it's significantly better than before. The amount of time I've invested now confirms this. I am amending my recommendation accordingly. Yet, the game still has its flaws. Read on if you're interested.

[h1]Bugs[/h1] 

Sometimes, industry might not work, and you need to replace buildings to get them functioning again. Thankfully, this happens only very rarely. The ferries are still extremely buggy, unfortunately. In missions where you have to build housing in one area and transfer items like food via a ferry, it becomes a real gamble whether they'll transport anything at all. Some missions with naval invasions, which destroyed some of my ferries, rendered them completely inoperable, and I had to build the ferries in a new location to make anything work. I could imagine some missions breaking completely and requiring a restart if there wasn't enough coastline to set up a ferry connection.

Another bug seems to involve the recruiter and forts. For some unknown reason, the recruiter MUST be on the same land as the forts; you cannot separate them, or no troops will be trained. Also, inexplicably, the archer forts require a road connection, while the others do not. I have now made it a habit to build roads to all forts.

[h1]The Combat[/h1] 

I've seen other reviews criticizing the game for how they've reworked combat. I find it dull to watch troops march towards each other and then engage in fighting animations.

[h1]Cons:[/h1] 
You no longer have control of your troops, so you can't target predators (I had to turn predators off in the settings for this reason).

[h1]Pros:[/h1] 
I appreciate the depth they've added, not just with more weapons, but also with armor for different troop types.
I like not having to worry about which direction on the map the enemy is coming from, a detail you never knew until they appeared.
The way walls create areas of protection is actually quite effective. If you encircle building blocks or industry correctly, you can prevent loss during missions with strong enemy attacks. I've saved many missions with proper wall placement.

Overall, I don't mind the combat rework, and im actually for the first time enjoying military missions, but they need to fix the issue with predators.

[h1]The UI[/h1] 

The UI is still atrocious. I cannot fathom how they managed to make it so much worse than the original. The advisor screen is also a downgrade. It took me about 100 hours to get used to it, especially the advisor screen and how to navigate it effectively. The biggest annoyance is the storage yards and bazaars, which use drop-down menus instead of simple button clicks to switch between accept/get/empty/don't accept options.

The notifications! The popup text is huge and occupies a lot of screen space. They've allowed for filtering many of the notifications, which is great. Now, many of them are hidden in the background for me. However, they still play the notification sound. For instance, if you have 1% unemployment, you'll be reminded with a notification sound either yearly or monthly, which can be quite tiresome to listen to while trying to build your city and enjoy the beautiful music.

I wish there was an option to turn off notification sounds.

[h1]The Game[/h1] 

Overall, the new graphics are good, but they're just higher polygon counts than the original, and I'm not a fan of the cartoonish art style of the walkers.

The game looks and sounds nice, just like the original. The best feature, however, is the global recruitment pool option in the settings.

Though the game still has bugs and flaws, it's enjoyable now. I don't think I'll be playing the original again, as this version captures the essence of the old Pharaoh.

So yes, they did fix the one thing that made the old game almost unwinnable BUT if you are a purist don't change he settings! It's the best of both worlds! Brilliant! 

Very well done remake! These folks need to be an example to others that want to re-release old games. If we loved the old game then you don't change game play! Just update the graphics but otherwise LEAVE IT ALONE!

Every once in a while a worker will get stranded when crossing the river. But for the most part this fixed a lot my issues with the original game. 

This game has always been a favorite of mine and I still played the original version until I bought this one. With the improvements on game play, the game itself is much more enjoyable.

My favorite fixes: 
1. You can turn off recruiters so that you simply pull from the active working pool. 
2. You can now fully zoom out on the maps.
3. The gods panel is easier to work.
4. While I didn't like it at first, the new layout for item selection is far superior to the old one.
5. Battles are simplified in a way that makes sense.

Things that still need work: (mostly resource issues)
1. Maps still aren't quite right as far as resource distribution. Sometimes the resources available don't match with what you can make vs what you can import. 
2. Resources distribution in general never really makes sense. For instance you can have shields in one level of the campaign, but in the next you cannot. 
3. Demands from outside sources (the Pharaoh and other cities) can hit fast and with little time to gather resources. 
4. Workers sometimes can't use ferries to transport goods, but sometimes can so you never know where to build things until you test run the higher level cities several times only to give up at the final levels because nothing makes sense.

Not worth any money because it fails to deliver on its promises of being the ""NEW ERA""
Its exactly like any other cheap mobile game with dumbed down mechanics.
I have played Caeser 3, Patrician all series, Zeus all my life and this is by far the worst game among all of them.

How does one make a game AFTER they have the blueprint to all the previous games?
How do you make a game with LESSER features than its predecessor?

I uninstalled as soon as I saw the first war.
There is NO war, its a single screen autoplay animation. Wasted my 4 hours on it.
Wish  i had seen the youtube video as I usually do, before this purchase :(

DUMBED down version of all resource management games.
Not worth to be called a PC game.

However, I think it's worth checking out if you like ancient history and city builders. The historical accuracy is decent and despite some very obvious flaws for the sake of gameplay (Ancient Egyptians didn't have currency), it does a good job of portraying Ancient Egypt beyond the normal highlights like Cleopatra and King Tut.

The biggest issue I have is the balance. The game isn't super easy or anything, but it's really common to steamroll the late game completely and end up just waiting around for the monuments to finish, which takes ages. I know that's historically accurate and everything, but it doesn't make the game more fun. Pro tip: Clicking the speed up button twice lets you increase the game speed to 5x. It will still take ages, but it will be significantly faster and it's not obvious you can do this in the UI. I wish there were a way to just be like ""super speed until this monument is done"" because your city is completely self-sufficient at this point and waiting is boring. It's also pretty common to just run out of jobs for people to do and end up with a ton of extra resources lying around because traders will only take a small amount at a time and hey, you gotta make people do something or they'll get angry with you.

I think a lot of these balance issues are probably because this is a remaster a game from 1999 and things in games weren't really perfected back then. They're not perfect now either but we've come a long way since. This game does offer some nice modernization options like just assigning people to jobs from a global labor pool instead of waiting for recruiters to randomly walk past their house, but it can't really fix the fundamental balance of the original. If you're a city builder fan looking for a modern, well-balanced experience, this isn't it.

Developer is also active and dropping big patches. The new custom scenario editor just dropped

Admittedly still not sold on the new art style and direction, I also don't hate it either. Trying to play the original release at higher res is an exercise in pain (it works but best memorize the magnifier shortcut on widows - good luck reading anything past 1080p). I get why they went with the new look, effort clearly went into it and there are definite improvements plus it is clear the team is made of passionate fans themselves. I think my biggest issue is not the new game visuals but the interface itself, it literally feels like it was done following a UI tutorial included with adobe illustrator 2013.

My issues with the game are mainly about glitches. I don't really care about graphical glitches (such as stonemasons not being seen when working on the pyramid,...), but there are some really annoying gameplay glitches. For example all houses loose access to all services, when you reload a game, which makes a lot of houses to devolve very soon. Then when you import certain resource on some maps (especially stone or bricks) they sell you negative amount (?) and you gain so much money so fast. Another really common glitch is that people are not interested coming into your houses occasionally, it is not a question of popularity or high taxes, sometimes they are just not interested in populating certain specific houses and this especially happens on more evolved types of housings. Some glitches happen on certain maps, but most glitches happen on all maps like for instance the reloading glitch.
The game itself is not bad, but it has a lot of issues that need to be addressed (mainly the glitches).
For me I also didn't enjoy the combat, it is controversial topic I know, however I liked the old clunky system more (and you could have balanced it on higher difficulties yourself by editing certain file in the original game) instead of completely ditching it and replacing it with the new system, which for me is completely devoid of life.
However there are good things about the game. I enjoyed the new graphics, new buildings (bow maker,..), new music is fine and certain glitches are actually not present like in the original game (glitching dancer for example).
I will wait for developers to fix glitches and hopefully make a return to the old style of combat or at least having the option to do so before revisiting this game.",1695567604,1695567604,False,65,1,0.777253985404968262,0,True,False,False

In Saqqara they wouldn't deliver papyrus to the Scribe School unless I deleted and rebuilt the School. In Meidum, cartpushers wouldn't get stuff across the Ferrys even though all Ferrys were staffed (this was finally solved by deleting and rebuilding one of the Ferries). These bugs make the game unplayable if you're trying to complete missions fast.

Besides the bugs, I think some improvements and QoL changes would be necessary to make the game more enjoyable:
-I'd like to be able to zoom out all the way out and see my entire city
-Minimap
-Ignore notifications option
-Hotkeys for buildings
-A 10x or 20x speed option (this is a must for big pyramid levels, since most of the time you can complete the entire city layout years before the pyramid completes).
-Make it so the UI does not interfere with bulding placement near the edge of the map.
-A harder difficulty setting. Hard difficulty feels like easy or normal in the original game.
-Gods are way too easy to please, and their blessings add too much RNG to the game.

Enter Pharaoh: A New Era. I was initially a little worried about the game because of the reviews and the thoughts surrounding it on the Impression Games subreddit.

Well, at the time of posting, 28 Aug with five hours of playtime, that seemed quite unfounded. The game runs really well, I'm really thankful for the ultrawide support they added in a prior patch, and I'm just having a lot of fun. 

Sure, it isn't an exact 1:1, but it is still a great game in its own right. Yes, the military is different: the battles happen offscreen in their own window, but to me, that's completely fine -- the Impression Citybuilder Series was never about combat anyways; I have Age II for that. One thing I was sad about that is different is that the Nile floodbanks no longer grow grass in them; they're barren. For such a nutrient-rich farmland, shouldn't the wild grasses grow over the course of the growing season? I also wouldn't mind a return of Very Hard/Impossible, either. I know there was a bug in the original that made one mission not doable on Impossible, but I imagine it's fixable, and hope for its return -- unless New Era's ""Hard"" is tuned similar to Impossible.

Some of the changes aren't all bad, however. The optional QOL changes are great: no more need for your 2x2 or 1x1 slum near your mines or other buildings, because you can toggle on Global Workforce. And, as they did think about it due to the lack of actual military units, you can toggle off predators. No more need to make military units or a bunch of police to kill the predators, then build walls around them. 

All in all, it's an excellent remake/remaster, and I am having a great time, and I'm about to have another binge session.

I've been stuck on the North Dashur mission and had to restart after putting in several hours because the Pyramid just stops building for no reason everytime it hits 22 percent. The game devs keep putting out patches and even specifically state they've addressed this issue, and every single patch, I'm stuck on the same spot. Extremely frustrating and I doubt I'll ever purchase anything from this studio ever again. Don't waste your money. The original game runs better than this garbage.

Update: I still stand by what I said about releasing a remake of a game thats 20 years old and having more bugs than the original, I have however found a solution to the pyramid freezing problem. Which was saving the game and reinstalling everytime it happened through out the Dashur mission. Not a sustainable solution for a bug and not one I should have to do it all on my end but after my 4th reinstall I was finally able to pass the Dashur mission. Since, I've not had the same bug. Just a similar one where all the work camps just decide to stop sending people to work in the fields for no reason. Thankfully saving and reloading seems to do the trick when that happens and doesn't require the full reinstall. 


Updated, the devs have fixed a lot of the issues I've mentioned above. I'd probably change my recommendation to a Yes if they'd fix the notifications they just broke. Now whenever I send my troops to help in another city, I get a message saying my victorious companies are slinking back in disgrace from defeat.

It takes the original and offers an updated musical score while keeping the style and feel true to the original, several QoL adjustments and improvements, but otherwise keeps the essence that made the original so great.  They are still working out several bugs, as this was not release-ready when it was released, and they had a LOT of bugs to squash, but the development team seems to be fairly responsive to consumer feedback, which is encouraging.  Also the battle aspect was completely hacked together, seemingly last-minute, to make the game ""releasable"", but otherwise is complete garbage.  Supposedly, a complete rewrite of the battle system is on the to-do list; let's hope so. The battle system notwithstanding, the game has so far completely lived up to my expectations, given the early stage of post-release development.

Now, it does have the feel of the original game, soundtrack, etc., but there is a surprising number of changes made that really take away from the original game. 
The military is pretty much useless now, just build some forts and hope for the best. No micromanaging your military units, setting up funnels, walls, or anything. The wacky overseer listings really through you for a loop if you're too used to the original setup for the game. Things not where they should/need to be. Now personally the biggest complaint I have about this game other than the useless military, are two things. Firstly, the debt ceiling. They lowered it to 5k Deben. Yep. 5K. Not 50K. Dumb right. Especially for players, like me, who break even on the city purchases to continue the rapid growth. It is a very vain attempt to force players to slow down and take more time in the game. Absolutely ridiculous. Lastly, the broken pathing system. I know the original game had similar problems with its units not going where they should, but with all the other changes/updates I'm not sure why something so basic like unit pathing was overlooked and not updated as well. 
Now for the good things about the game. It runs great and all the buildings, units, people, etc., look great. The remastered soundtrack is great and delivers an authentic feel for the game. Lastly, and hands down this is the greatest thing about the game. The Global Workforce Pool. This is what I'm talking about. Instead of having hundreds of job recruiters walking around to houses to find labor, you now have the ability to have the jobs auto fill from the entire city's population of available workers. Now of course, having workers come from all over the city poses its own issues, especially with the newly implemented age workforce they added. 
Is it a fun game? Sure, but only if you like city building. Battles and military are basically voided now. It is strictly building the city and monuments.

While there are a lot of under-the-hood fixes i'm sure, the core design of the game has not changed, at all. 24 years and we haven't budged an inch, frozen in time warts and all.

The original Pharaoh was a cult classic, for many reasons. It had an amazing monument-building system, where you can watch a pyramid being gradually constructed, step by step, in realtime, over literal hours. That feature is here in all its glory

Pharaoh also had some neat graphics for its time, colourful and detailed, thoroughly atmospheric. Those are here too, almost exactly as they were. Its like all the original sprites have been upscaled and smoothed, they look identical to how you remember. Though it is a missed opportunity to do something better, we could have had 3D

However, the original Pharaoh had many crippling design flaws too. The walker-service system - where buildings provide services by sending out a worker who walks around servicing houses he passes, was an atrocious, unintuitive mess. Prone to being frustrated by random luck since the guy chooses randomly at each intersection and makes no attempt at prioritising houses that actually NEED serviced, and requiring extremely specific layouts to not fall apart and leave half your people starving or sick. That system, too, is here and entirely untouched. It is still awful and I hate it

All the gods are back and still as unreasonably childish as ever. Operating on a bizarrely short timescale where being in favor fades rapidly., and a god goes from loving you to cursing your city in the span of five minutes, if you aren't constantly throwing festivals to placate them. These festivals aren't even expensive, they're just busywork to open several menus and click through. This is Not Fun, it was never fun and it needs to be fixed. Why can't I just automate festivals cycling through all the gods? I don't need to do all this clicking. This is by far the worst part of the game, the constant busywork of dealing with gods is completely unrewarding and just gets in the way of the city building and monument construction - the actual fun parts.

The god effects are untouched too. Ptah's curse is still devastatingly crippling, while his boon - of restocking three extremely specific industries that you probably don't even have - is still worthless to a functioning economy. None of the gods are really worth investing time or effort in, except that they screw you over if you don't. The whole religion system needed a redesign

The building risks are back too. Most structures will collapse or go up in flames if they aren't serviced - by a random walker - from the appropriate buildings. And this is tightly regimented. If you forget for a while, you'll suddenly find every single building collapsing simultaneously because you built them at the same time and there is zero variance in it. Its just more pointless busywork

Building farms is still a nightmare, they are rigidly 3x3 areas, though the nile floodplains are definitively NOT that shape. You can't possibly avoid wasting huge amounts of space, and navigating road networks is a nightmare because the jagged corners of a floodplain are unbuildable on all four tiles around them. Surely we could have gotten individual 1x1 fields to paint across it?

There is at least one ray of light here. These developers have added a Global Recruitment Pool. Previously. buildings had to send out a random walker (where did he come from?) to find nearby houses to recruit workers from, which meant every tiny outpost needed a slum. Now they can draw labor from the city at large, if you enable the option. This is great, and it shows the developers are capable of seeing faults in the source material and improving on it. If only they'd applied that philosophy to the rest of the game, this review would be positive

Ultimately, Pharaoh: A New Era, is a missed opportunity. It worships an original that was always flawed, and fails to fix any of its terrible designs. But the original is still out there and it runs fairly easily on any computer. The (minor) graphical update is the only real reason to buy this. Maybe that's enough for you

In the basic gameplay, the chief strategy mechanic is the wandering workers.  Some workers, such as delivery people, know exactly where they're going.  It's the other workers that are the trick:  At intersections, they turn a random direction.  So, for example, if there is a four-way intersection between your firehouse and some housing, your fireman has a 2/3 chance of turning the ""wrong"" way at the intersection (he will never turn back the way he came, leaving 3 options open, only one of which leads to our hypothetical housing).  Now, it is not necessary for the fireman to make the correct turn every single time.  It's just that the chance of fire is always rising very slowly, and having a fireman pass by resets the chance to zero.  The same principal is true of many other kinds of service providers.  This turns out to be a wonderful mechanic and is what made the old game great.  You build great cities based on probability.  Trying to make everything absolutely, 100% safe (from fire, for example) can gimp your game in other ways, requiring many redundant buildings and using more labor and taking more space.  The game throws a wrench at perfectionism and presents near-perfectionism as an efficient alternative.

After playing the game a while, and having played the old game quite a lot, I find most of the negative 
reviews unjustified.  Granted, I waited to buy the game.  It seemed like there were real issues at launch.  But the game as it stands now is a very good remake and has many smart QoL features vs. the old game.  For example, you can set your storage buildings to accept or reject all goods by default.  Rejecting by default prevents sudden shifts in delivery the instant you place a storage yard.  On the other hand, you have to activate the storage manually each time.  So it's up to you.  You can also make the game work like the sequel to the old game, Zeus Master of Olympus, by automatically connecting everyone to the labor network, instead of playing the difficult game of depending on wandering recruiters to find workers.  The latter, original, gameplay is harder.  But the former is a good deal of fun and lets you focus on other tasks.  

Just like Zeus, the graphics are tasteful and colorful and will look good for many years to come, even when they are quite outdated.  The ostriches are adorable (real ostriches are definitely not).  The music is fine, though I do miss the old Pharaoh soundtrack.  I would like to see police engage animal threats, as they did in the old game.  I don't want to do gamey things like surround animals with buildings to make a cage.  So I choose to turn off animal predation.  I have read reviews indicating glitches while building the enormous pyramids, as of this date.  This might be a result of running out of supplies while building, and I hope it gets fixed soon.  Keep in mind, running out of supplies while building is what you don't want to happen anyway, as it greatly impairs construction regardless of bugs.  If I run into serious trouble with pyramids, I'll update this.  

About the combat.  Yeah, the old game had armies that actually engaged each other on  the main map and could destroy stuff.  But let's be honest, fighting was pretty wonky back in the old game.  The new abstracted system avoids exploits and the old glitches, although it does remove what tactical gameplay existed before.  It's a city builder. 

The game costs about $20, and as always, there are whiners judging it as though it were a $60 AAA game.  Ignore them.  For an inexpensive game, it's a great city builder.  So many games try to overwhelm you with graphical effects, but this one is has a simpler yet pleasing presentation that lets you get on with city building.

I've had no crashes and seen no real bugs.  Playing with wandering recruiters is challenging but not crushing in detail.  I recommend the game highly.",1689362230,1689362773,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played Pharaoh/Cleopatra for over 20 years - since it was first released, so I was keen to give this a go. I like how you are not limited to just 6 warships - the limit is increased to 10. There's still a limit of 6 forts though. I like being able to build in pause mode, just like in Emperor, and I also like that you can toggle the global workforce pool option so you don't have to worry about putting houses near mines for example. This used to be annoying because there's no grass near the mines most of the time. The fixed worker ratio is also very handy for the ageing population. The military sequences still don't work - soldiers and ships just go past each other without fighting, but the stats at the end work so you still find out who won the battle. I also don't like how the policemen don't fight the predators. In the OG version, the cops would kill the predators if they happened upon them. Now they just get killed like the other walkers (Edit: just realised there's a setting in options where you can turn off predators). I used to use them as defence to protect the delivery guys. I've also had an issue with work suddenly stopping on the large Mastaba - I had to delete all the guilds and replace them to jump start the work a couple of times. This was an existing issue with pyramid building in the OG game, so it's a little annoying that it's carried over to the new version. Some other small bugs I've found, like messages reappearing whenever you re-load the game (like the 100 population milestone), and not being able to see the unemployment percentage when you hover over the population stat unless your mouse is not over any buildings. Overall though, I still like the new version and will keep playing it.

To the Developers: No Map Rotation, NO purchase from me. The ability to rotate the map, to see the city and the natural features from different angles in invaluable in planning. So, keep refusing to include Map Rotation, I will keep my money!

Part of the challenge of Pharaoh/Cleopatra was spending yourself into a hole so deep you could not see sunshine and then turning your city around and make a profit before Pharaoh's army arrives to run roughshod over you.

And now I see reviews where people describe rude comments/feedback-to-the-feedback from the developers. They failed to deliver what they promised so they take it out on their customers? Not good.

My computer is 2 years old and I still play the original game, both the Steam version and from my original CD.

The change in how battles/military events works is like a cut scene that auto grabs your available military. This is a change from the original Pharaoh, where you would have to physically move your troops to wherever the enemy spawns. I prefer this update to the original immensely.


The updated graphics are actually really nice, very faithful to the original while being able to have more detail, brighter colors, and just slightly more historically accurate to boot. The UI updates are welcome, as well.

Some of my favorite changes are: the new war/battle system.  Instead of having to manually walk your soldiers to a specific location on the map for every battle, a new dialogue box pops up and shows the battle, stats, etc. and bases the outcome on your current military strength + any Seth blessings you've earned.  

I also love the ability to switch to a ""global labor pool"" in the settings.  It never made sense to me that if there was a high unemployment rate in your city, that people who were desperate for work wouldn't be able to get a job at the nearest granary just because it was 1 map tile too far away.  H3ll no!  If I'm a person who's desperate for work, I'm going to hoof it all the way across town for a job if I have to! (And that's exactly what I've done in the past IRL too, so...)

Anyway.  Fundamentally not a lot changes, so don't go into this thinking it's a sequel or anything.  It's not.

- Incomplete military and battle. It's clear they wanted to do more with this aspect but didn't get around to it. Troops just walk across the screen and the health bars mean nothing. That's the entire military system. They knew very well this feature wasn't done but released it anyway.

- Broken trading
Edit: I think this aspect has been mostly ironed out, though it's not perfect. I noticed it took way too long for new trade routes to actually start trading. Just put all your storage yards for traded goods as close to your docks as possible.

- No ability to rotate the camera.
The devs themselves actually said they will not be adding this feature. Apparently it's not possible with the game base. Are you kidding me? How the heck are we supposed to build on and interact with the land behind tall obstacles like pyramids, temples and temple complexes? The original game did this. What kind of isometric projected video game (let alone one in 2023) doesn't let you rotate the view? This is just pathetic.

- New issues as of 6/21/23:
These are new glitches that showed up for me in the new patch:
1. Pathfinding was broken. Bazaar traders aren't properly stocking a third type of food, and a empty fort across the river via ferry isn't triggering the recruiter to spawn new soldiers.
2. New graphical issues. I haven't really complained about them in this review, but there's more now. Random buildings go into hidden/overlay mode for no reason. Not a huge issue, but a new annoying one only just introduced with the last update.
3. Political overseer/request glitches. Tyre threatened to attack me, and as I was bracing for that attack and the deadline passed, nothing happened.

Look, I get it. Scope creep is a real problem in game development these days and no publisher wants to have to push back release dates. But I would have preferred another 6 months or even year delay of this game over the bugs that get more obvious the further you go. 

I like the concept and style of this game. And I want to like this one. But this one is bad. And the devs recent ""bug fix"" posts are insultingly disingenuous because they act like it's just a few bugs and they're going to get them fixed soon. Here's the reality: The game is completely missing critical parts and I can not believe they weren't well aware of it. That's why if you really want this game, then hold off until it's fixed and enjoyable, and that way you don't get the painful experience all of us who paid for it are going through, and the devs aren't rewarded for releasing an incomplete game.

The graphics are just plain bad. If they did make some improvements, I couldn't see it. Other than being playable on a modern system, there's nothing here that will wow you visually.

The gameplay is sucky too.

One quickly realizes that ""original"" is not always best. Since this title, many city builders have come out with far less tedious rules and restrictions on growth and development.

Lastly, $20 for real?? There is no way this title is worth that compared to more recent games out there. If you really want it, wait until its around $5.00.

They have listened to the players and are working hard to bring this game to the masterpiece it once was. With the many updates I have to now provide a positive review of this game. Below is my original review.

Many bugs and glitches have been fixed in the Game.
A minimap has been added.
The UI is greatly improved although I would recommend that you use hot keys.
The military system is still awful but they have said they are working on making it much better with the possibility of bringing it back to its former glory.
Animations have been improved. The festival square is now animated!!

I look forward to continued improvements to see that this game once again is memorialized by the gods of Egypt.


Sadly, I have to give this remake a thumbs down for many reasons. I spent too many hours as a kid to count and even more as an adult on the original game. Old vs new review:

Pros and cons:

Pros:
I like the music remakes
The art style is beautiful
The loyalty to the original (for the most part)
Nostalgia

Cons:
Waiting two years for a buggy and otherwise poor quality game
Can't rotate maps - why was this removed?
No mini-map (This has been added back since first review with improvements!!
UI is difficult to navigate - a lot clunkier than the original with massive notifications
Many graphs and buttons with no explanation or meaning. You have to decipher them like genuine hieroglyphics. (The Devs have listened and the UI is much better, the buttons are easier to navigate)

They completely reworked the military system. You no longer have any control of he units and cannot move them on the map. They opted for a auto-generated combat system. Not a fan. This is in no way like the original and is awful. Why would they change it?
Due to the military change, the hostile animals have free reign on the map and ransack your town and there is nothing you can do about it. Even the constables do nothing to the animals. Why? (Devs are working on the military system, we'll see how it goes.)

The festival Square does not have entertainers or temple priests that show up during festivals. It stays empty unlike the original game.

I'll be going back to the original for now. This is not a step up from the original but a step down. I pray the developers take these negative feedback and really ask themselves why they choose to remake this game and what were they trying to achieve. I feel they spent way to much time reworking the music and the graphics and not enough attention to the end user experience.

I may update this review later. For now it is a disappointment. 😢

The game has improved much since I left my review. I will try this game again and see how things have improved over time.

I believe the combat system is still a placeholder, I believe, but overall I can now recommend the game to players of OG Pharaoh and new players, alike.

Original Review: Summary: If you're a hardcore fan of the original 1999 Pharaoh and must play it asap, go ahead and do so. The game is playable but there are a few feature's you'll notice are different, and a number of bugs. For those that are fine waiting, I recommend waiting until the developers have been able to provide a series of patches. Once the game is in a better state I will revise my review, but at the moment I have to give them a thumbs down.

Pros:

-It feels legit! Getting all the same vibes from decades ago.

-I appreciate the fidelity to the original graphics while adding resolution.

-As expected of a modern title, you can window out of the program.

-The soundtrack is wonderful. They took the original tracks but had actual native performers of (as close as knowingly possible to) period instruments riff on the melodic themes of each song. It's familiar but also new. I love it! I saw one Steam review claiming all the music is horrible and is synthesized. That's just wrong. There is a video on YouTube explaining the music composition process and while some of the background is synthesized, so many melodic elements are real instruments played by many native performers. 

Cons:

-I don't know how else to say it. I appreciate the added resolution to people, but they made them look like smartphone game characters with their overly-cartoonish style.

-Not having support for ultrawide resolutions at launch is extremely unfortunate, especially after a dev response on Steam months ago said it would. Ultrawide support is a reasonable ask for a game at launch in 2023. And by ultrawide I mean 2560x1080 and 3440x1440 resolutions. They're not even treating this as a bug but as a feature that was never planned for that they want to add soon, though.

-The UI is quirky just as it was in the original, but I know I will get used to it... again.

-The ability to rotate the whole screen in 90-degree increments is not present, which existed in old Pharaoh. Apparently they say this caused walkers to disappear as it did in the original. I'm sorry, I feel like they should have had the ability to make this happen. Yes, you can press ""F"" to flatten the structure view so you can make sure things are placed properly, but I always enjoyed the ability to change perspectives. 

-No minimap, which also existed in old Pharaoh.

-Many fans hoped the battle mechanics would be upgraded in this remake. Instead, they were essentially removed altogether with an autoresolve! Extremely disappointing.

-I also found another bug where I donated some family savings to my city but it didn't work out, so I restarted the mission, and it didn't restore my family savings. A bummer.

-Over on the Discord people are reporting a lot of other issues of varying criticality.

Overall:

Pharaoh: A New Age is a pleasant and visually pleasing tech upgrade to a cherished game released in 1999. Unfortunately, at launch week, this version leaves out game features from the 1999 version and also has a number of impactful bugs. Hopefully with time, Dotemu can fix these issues and get it to a state where I can recommended it to new players.",1676682589,1686365890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- no mini-map (it was in original game!)
- HORRIBLE UI WHICH RUIN ALL THE PLEASURE, please throw out your UI designers. Original interface was unbelievably better. Even chinese mobile game devs do it better...
- Minimum processor Ryzen 5 3600X ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? ARE YOU OHUELI TAM? original game can be launched on calculator and i see no real difference with it. And do not tell me lies about ""we need modern 64-bit processor, bla bla bla"". It's just laziness of your coders, which decided to use shitty architecture.

In current state price for this game is too much. 50% off will do fine.

UPD: now it is totaly bugged. I've done everything required for winning the campain mission (first medium stepped pyramid), but it is not ending, though the winning conditions are fully met. I cannot continue playing. FFS, devs, how can you simply not make it even playable?

UPD 2:
devs heard most of the blame from gamers. They fixed critical bugs and added mini-map. Though, game still have bad and not intuitive UI, and lacks few core features of original game (e.g.: crocodiles can eat everyone without being punished; army and battles is still uncontrollable and looks like cheap mobile game). Though, the game is much better that on the release day, so i can carefully recommend it. Better with 50% discount.

Upd 3:
Forget about 2nd update, bugs are back and in more numbers..
UPD: 4 totaly unplayable once again. Workers do not go to farms (no reason), archers disappears after going to fort from recruiter, while number of stationed units remains the same..and a lot of other small stuff that ruins gameplay

There are still too many interrupting pop-ups for my liking, particularly when in fast mode of course because things are just going fast anyway, but they are better now. I have played through a campaign and am now on my second campaign and have played through some custom missions, so it can't be all that bad. I can really get lost in playing. Sometimes the monument building stalls but I just save, exit and get back in which seems to fix it. There are still instances where you can export a product, but do not have the ability to even manufacture it, or import items that have no trade route for it, that's still weird. All in all, I think you can invest and get what you paid for out of this game now. Have fun paying!

ORIGINAL: I would not recommend this game right now because there are still quite a few bugs, like excessive pop ups and warnings that interrupt game play and the flow of the game. There are also issues with importing and exporting goods, like the Importing as Needed, and exporting of goods that are not even part of the scenario. Who wants to export wood and copper for example when the scenario doesn't supply it? All aside from how long it takes to produce goods and get trade going. It's just frustrating to play right now. With that said, I really like the new graphics and music. I know a lot of people don't like the battle scenarios, but I appreciate not having to deploy my troops on my own. I like the game, but until there are fixes, which there have been a lot of complaints about, I would wait a little while before spending money on it.

Also I can't comment on the state at launch, but I can comment this game has been getting consistent patching and updates by the devs and I've encountered no serious issues, only minor stuff. (And I do agree a few of the ""bugs"" are instead people not understanding some obscure mechanic).

A legendary city-builder, it's unique mechanics such as the flooding of then Nile, god management. Honestly to this date it still provides a lot of fun, things to think about and the tools to make exactly the egiptian city you want, from monuments to parks to all the amenities and services an old city needed. Is it a good game still in 2023? Absolutely.

Combat was simplified but let's be honest it was terrible in the old game so I much prefer it that way.

Buildings, Gods, Icons and the general visual changes kept the original style but cartoonized it in a way I feel stands better the test of time and I really liked the new sprites - the only controversial part is the people and animals - they can look a bit too overstilized and I'm NOT getting used to them but you're looking at them from afar so it doesn't bug you that much. 

I do wish they added a few more animations though, as others have mentioned.

The music was a bit overhauled but mostly kept to the original, I do wish they had added more tracks and variety though as you're going to be in the same city for a while

Menus and UI is MUCH easier to navigate than the old version. The optional new job system makes the game way more in line with modern city builders and removes a fair number of annoyances IMO.

Still needs some fixes and I have large fear that the UI is not going to get fixed, as their recent QoL update didn't really change the UI icons or layout. No military rework yet, so waiting still. After months, still don't really see any reason to play this over the OG, which is a shame. The old military system was clunky and unpleasant but what it was replaced with is somehow even worse.


_________________
I can't get into it, despite being a huge, addicted fan of the original. I have hours spent on the old game, yet I bounce off this one hard - it just lacks some features of the original. At least it has a minimap now, still mind-boggling it launched without one.

After the patches this game remains an unpleasant experience - the UI just needs a fundamental rework, the main menu itself is just unpleasant to interact with. I miss the UI from the old game: it was well designed, clean, fit the game, offered all the information necessary and had names of buildings in a list rather than pictures that get confusing (law office uses the same one as one of the advisers on the left, great, that won't get confusing). This one feels at once over designed and low effort. Graphs don't offer enough information. The icons on the left side look like generic excel spreadsheet icons with an orange tint. The hekk happened here.

There really is no reason to play this one over the OG one, which is probably the worst part about this game. In fact this game made me go back and play the original game, mostly to check if I were dreaming or misremembering features of the old one. Turns out, this game just straight up got rid of some QoL things for no reason.
Still waiting for a patch to implement very basic functions from the old game like:

- message for when a request is ready to be fulfilled
- a way to deal with wildlife that isn't walling them with statues
- a main menu that isn't an unpleasant tedious slideshow (It's a bit better post patch but still includes unnecessary mouse clicks and is imo still too slow)
(edited as the recent patch introduced some of them)

I saw a sentiment that the game is 'good now' and granted it's better than back at the release when it had issues with save corruption for like over a month, but it's far from an experience I'd call pleasant enough to warrant playing this over the original game. I also heard that 'because the new reviews posted are good, clearly it means the game is now great', but I feel like the real reason is that the people who gave it a negative review still don't think it is 'fixed' - that was my sentiment, so I am reposting my negative review post-patches to share my thoughts on it within the 'latest reviews' spaces.

Pharaoh is one of my favorite childhood game of all time, in this review I will only focus what new in this game.

- The new graphic, some like it, some hate it. It is beautiful, but I have no comment on it.

- The global workforce pool is great! It use the same mechanic from Emperor, which reduce an annoying single house stand out of nowhere for workforce. It make game easier and less tedious.

- The remove of military units from the map. I was surprise and hate it at first, but after playing for while, I find it is very convenient when you play a long mission. In the old game, you have to position your troop again and again, every time the enemy come to your door, it was fun, but still quiet annoying to run around defend building from an enemy force that sometime it is too few for me to care. With the new era, all battle conclude in just one screen click, it dose feel less tedious when I think of it.

Overall, I give a thumb up, because of it is mostly the same mechanic as the predecessor. But in my humble opinion, I think they should remaster “Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom” instead. Since it license stuck on GOG forever, so I was hope that I can have all Sierra game on the Steam platform to fulfill my childhood dream.",1684682694,1684683909,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most of the gameplay changes are meaningful mechanical improvements to the original games problem areas like its military system and pretty much nothing regarding the actual gameplay has been made worse. Although the game is glitchy, it is not as bad as people have been saying and much of it has just been people not understanding mechanics. The actual major problem with this game is with its artistic changes. 

Most of the changes made to the game have been made to improve the gameplay and the developers have succeeded in this regard. The broken and buggy military system of the original game has been replaced with a more hands-off system that makes combat more about just developing a good military-industrial complex. Exploiting the AI’s bad deployment or breaking them with walls, bridges and bottlenecks is not really an option anymore. Maps like the Dunqul Oasis and Rowarty will demand one hoard savings over the course of an era to be able to rapidly build a military-industrial complex for a massive rush. Military missions become death matches instead of just the AI showing up and leaving after landing on the wrong island or being blocked off from an island by buildings. Sometimes more is less and this new simpler military system adds a lot more depth to the game. Other minor changes include visual changes to flood plains that make it easy to know which lands are fertile, a streamlined UI, a good tutorial that is not chaotic & buggy, customizable key binds, a nilometer to better plan for floods, and more options in the settings to customize one’s experience like the ability to disable the employers needing to walk to housing mechanic. 

Unfortunately, this game was buggy on release, but most issues complained about on the Steam forum have been people simply not understanding the game. People were unable to construct pyramids, but they simply did not know that they needed to build a carpenter and give them wood to construct ramps for the pyramid. They did not know that their workforce ages out of being workers and that stone masonrys are the first places to lose their labor.  People struggled with workers not coming to their settlement, but their city sentiment was too low because of high taxes and low wages. Some just did not know that they needed burial provisions for their pyramids to win missions. Other major issues like farmers not going out to the floodplains to work or carry stones up the pyramid could be resolved by just reloading an autosave. Most issues were not serious issues, but there were serious issues with the game. It was just not as terrible as people would have you believe due to misunderstandings. The games campaign was completely beatable on release on its hardest settings, and one could put in well over a hundred hours with only a couple annoying glitches slowing progress. The game is definitely less buggy than the original and most of the bugs in this remaster are from the original.

The biggest issue with this game is its graphics and artistic changes. Overall, everything looks great. Most of the building redesigns are good, and the game even has more UI art,  screen art and even an opening cinematic that literally looks right out of the Prince of Egypt film. However, a lot of little details were lost. Instead of five-man teams pulling stones to the pyramid and up the scaffolding its just one guy pulling bricks up one at a time and disappearing as they reach the higher parts of the pyramid. The people carrying stuff to the tombs in the valley do not have their own unique sprites.  Land caravan traders will only ever have one mule in their caravan regardless of how much they are carrying. The flood plains change works well mechanically, but it was more enjoyable to transform the old games weed filled floodplains into productive farmlands. Bridges are just planks of wood no matter how long the bridge is which means boats just phasing through bridges instead of having a way to pass under them. Obelisk construction scaffolding is less interesting, and obelisks look less interesting as their writing is not visible until construction is finished.  People no longer not dance at the festival squares. There are quite a few minor issues like this, but they add up and were a lot of what made these Impression Game’s city builders special. 

This is a great remaster, but it has tradeoffs. Its much better gameplay wise and will probably be even better as the devs patch up some of the glitches as they have been doing. However, a lot of the little things that made the old game extra special were lost with the HD update.",1684042493,1684044729,True,218,1,0.918393850326538086,1,True,False,False

NOPE. This thing is still glitchy after all those patches. There were plenty of times I had to save and restart just to get basic game functions to work again. Then the icing on the cake that now has me writting this review instead of playing the game right now. 
Get to the Itjtawy level, and the workers have decided not to make it over to the plain farms. Whoops. Plenty of workers available for the task and I am struck.

My personal qualms with the game so far:
- the art style/appearance of NPCs compared to the original game. Something about the people walking around just doesn't feel right. It's very mobile-gamey feel. In the original game, the people walking look like they belong there but in this remastered version it just feels off. Like they're too fake looking. (this probably doesn't make sense but I can't describe it any better)
- the Police don't attack the predators. I would like the police to be able to attack them like they do in the original game. Otherwise, you can't do anything about them. Might as well turn off the predators under the Gameplay options. (military is different in this remastered game so you can't move troops from a fort and have them crush those crocodiles)
- the city road (entrance to the map and exit to the map) needs to be connected by a continuous road. I am not sure why but if you don't have a continuous road, you will be spammed with ""blocked city path"" messages. In the original, this wasn't a thing. you can delete the road (spawn entrance and exit still exist with or without the road)
- Can't rotate the map. I am not sure why the remastered removed this (or maybe it hidden somewhere and I can't find it). 
- Can't move troops around on your map. I always thought it was fun moving troops around in your city.
- Campaign is exactly the same (so far as I can tell). This can be viewed as a good thing to some or a less-than good thing to others. Example: early on in the campaign, you need your Kingdom Rating to reach 70. Pharaoh hardly sends you any requests. I went 2 years, maybe even 3 years fast forward x5 without getting a request for goods. I am rolling in money and have all goods - please just ask me for things. (maybe the longer you reign in a mission, pharaoh could request more things?) Sometimes the mission just feels dead because there's nothing happening and you're sitting at x5 speed trying to have something happen. (mind you, I am currently playing on Normal difficulty)
- No one is dancing or celebrating on the Festival Square!? I don't see any priests or entertainers celebrating festivals on it like in the original game. I know the NPCs didn't have special animations but at least they walked all over that square.",1682985647,1683071270,True,3,0,0.535951077938079834,0,True,False,False

Minor issues are mostly bugs where storage yards or granaries say they have good, but it can't be fetched. Workers bugging out trying to fetch goods. Having to restart monuments because... i'm not sure. And farms not getting workers or getting them out of sync with the holy floods of Osiris...

The biggest issue is the military system and changes that have been made to it. Combat is no longer on the map but reminiscent of a mobile game. Towers and wall therefore no longer have a purpose. In some missions the use of these was integral to surviving, but are now unplayable.

What makes someone acquire 2,000 hours played in Civ? A mental awakening fostered by an amazing game. In elementary school when I had 0 friends, I would have the neighbor’s kids carpool with me into school every morning. We played this game every morning before school for years. I would come home, wait for my uncle to save his play through, and would resume my family history. My uncle and I eventually began a Dynasty together and over time I became the one carrying us through the impossible end game. Old Pharaoh isn’t a game for me, it was an event, a warm feeling, an early escape. 

I wanted to dislike this game but y’all are already in the “mixed review” territory, so I think I have a better chance of getting what I want by liking this game (BUT I REALLY DON’T). When I saw what the dev’s “sold” at launch I was ready to write this off as a Hogwarts Legacy cA$$h grab. I see they have made attempts to fix/improve, I hope for more of this because we are still a ways off fam. We need a three-pronged approach to developer time spent on this project, please continue reading:

1.	Bugs have to be priority one and its sad it was released in such a state. (I am not recommending this game to my uncle until Pharoah’s request is satisfied) 

2.	 Reversing negative changes made:

a.	THE MILITARY SYSTEM CHANGE IS A WAR CRIME: Its sad the Dev’s spent time to make something much worse. They removed the strategy involved by disabling the user from placing and positioning troops before & during combat. They converted to an “auto battler” that doesn’t even happen in your city, it just is a quick time even that is a separate pop up window. I get moving troops across water was sometimes annoying if your city was built up along the waterbed but what you replaced it with 1. Cost time and resources 2. Is less fun 3. Added bugs that will need to be addressed before you can change the combat system back to the original (doubling the work you will ultimately need to do)
b.	The overseer’s panels are more confusing and it frustrates me that time and resources were spent to just re-arrange in a less intuitive way. The old system had many hidden menus when this one just has a billion menus that are impossible to remember which Icon is which overseer screen. Much better way: Group by types of overseer for the first group (Example_) Pharaoh requested good & stockpiling resources are always done together, they shouldn’t be separate overseers put them both in the overseer of commerce screen. 
c.	The artistic changes look trashy. The cartoon-y style maybe was in the vein of hieroglyphics, but it looks more comic book-y. Personally I would remove all because it adds little and messes with the ancient vibes, the old art looked like it traveled 1000’s of year and was faded from the ages. The newer art looks like, respectfully, someone’s younger sister whipped it up in MS paint.
d.	Idk what happened to old music, idc if it was 8 bit and sounded awful I don’t hear many sounds in the game other than the SFX that were copy and pasted from the old game. In the promo you guys even talk about how proud you are of the new audio but its much worse. Maybe make the music more frequent because it seems like theres nothing other than SFX.
e.	Ect. (theres more but they bother me less, see other negative reviews)

3.	Adding positive changes to the 1999 version: I have seen negative steps taken, but I am waiting for any positive ADDITIONS. I see positive “tweeks/adjustments” but I want to see the devs add something, its 2023, lets show 1999 it’s been 20 years since people. Not trying to be caustic but a lot was left on the table with this release. NEW MISSIONS, new building designs, new buildings, new military unit classes (or a differentiation between ranged and melee naval combat), if there are positive improvements from the 1999 version, I am not seeing them.

- best city builder ever, you can easily lose track of time
- good ancient vibe, egyptian history is very interesting and beautiful
-  no bugs till now, all the previous bug or things missing from the original game has been patched inside 2 weeks from the release (for all the people lamenting about it, you are a bunch of ignorant paesants who do not know how developing works and basically have an hard time tying a shoe).
- great active bug fixing and support from the devs, thx you guys for the very good effort

Alright so I've decided to warrant my own execution for this, but this is indeed a so much better version than the old Pharaoh! Not just graphic wise.

Crime that warrants Hanging: You can actually set a fixed amount of workers as a percentage of your overall population, no fluctuation. This is amazing! The previous pharaoh was super annoying as apparently due to them aging you just lose so many workers even with a huge population, great addition!

Crime that warrants Beheading: You can turn off predators. Now I know that for some it was super fun to have 2 cohorts of archers and 3 warships to attack one hippo in the river so to protect your people, and still it doesnt even kill the hippo. By turning predators off, you've made life so much better.

Crime that warrants Drawn and Quartered: This is absolutely my favorite change to the original, the fact that the military invasions are disabled. They were super annoying to command and move around in the old version. What effectively happens when you are invaded is that it pops to another screen and the battle is automated between your own troops and theirs. You can skip the whole thing and get auto result because the display doesnt matter, its already a done thing. (Yes it is buggy, but not game breaking at least for my runs).

Crime that warrants being boiled in oil: To be able to disable those pesky recruiters to employ people so you could just place buildings anywhere with a road and it will function. Noice!

So before I go through hanging, beheading, being drawn and quartered, and being boiled, If you have some nostalgic feel to the old game, then definitely get this one. I know the above crimes make the game super convenient and easy but let's face the fact, Pharaoh was never a complex game. At best, just a tad bit more complex than a flashgame. The graphics are nice, and the game made convenient, so to mostly the purpose of going through the 4000 years of Egyptian history in 50 missions and build monuments. Thats about it really. The only criticism I have for this game is the polishing.

So I was extremely excited to see that they had remade the game with upgraded graphics and systems. While I accept that there are things that have been changed from the original, I personally love the changes. You can choose to use the new worker recruitment system that pulls from the entire population in order to employ your businesses/mines. This allows for me to zone my cities in a way that I prefer, with residential and industrial areas. If you want the old way where a recruiter had to find nearby homes for employees, you can always choose that and have your mining slums. Nothing is stopping you there.

I believe one of the largest complaints I have seen in reviews is the new battle system. Quite frankly, I hated the old battle system. Putting my armies somewhere I think the army is going to spawn and hope to intercept them was a horrible pain in the original. Now it just does a cut scene and calculates whether you were strong enough to win or not. Hilariously, most of the time in the cutscene the armies just sort of walk right past each other and do not fight. I sort of adore the charm. Of course, now that I am in further campaigns that introduced walls and gates and guard towers, I feel like they serve no purpose other than aesthetics. Maybe in future hippo levels I will use them.

An issue I have come across is building monuments. The last campaign my city stopped importing plain stone because the monument layer flagged the square as being complete, but it wasn't actually pulling any workers to go place the last square. So it just sort of sat at a standstill until I caught it months/years later and saved/reloaded the game to trigger it to correct itself. The monument building has a ton of graphical bugs with worker placement, but it is not game breaking by any stretch of the imagination.

Additionally, the game sets your salary when you build your personal mansion the first time. I have had multiple campaigns where my advisor tells me that I am paying myself above my station and the kingdom is not happy with it. I don't recall this being an issue in the original. I would even drop my pay down a few notches and still receive the error until I wasn't paying myself at all, so this might be a bug.

Overall, I love this game and the newer graphics and systems feel modern enough that it is way less of a slog than it was before. If you want the original experience, you can still get the original game on steam and play it that way. Regardless, if you love city builders/management, I cannot recommend this game highly enough.

The new art is great, the UI rework is well thought. The game explains the mecanics little by little so you can understand them.
One of the parts I like is the historical aspect as every mission follows the history of ancient egypt. You learn about the different king and pharaohs, dynasties and who build the different monuments of egypt.

The game is great, but there are too many bugs at the moment to fully experience the game. The devs are working on it - but the work should have been done before the release. There are corrupted save files, sometimes the progress on monuments are stuck after loading and sometimes there are mission breaking bugs because a city stops trading with you and you cannot recover.The game has potential to be a good city builder. The core game is a simplified version of Anno games, but with a charming egyptian touch. Don't expect a very complex and dynamic economy, it is centered around building big monuments.

[i]""The pharaoh is the heart of Egypt. The land is its body. And the people are its blood. One day, you will rule Egypt, my son. Your armies will thunder across the boundless desert. And it shall tremble beneath them."" [/i]

These words from the opening cutscene of Pharaoh are burned into my memory. When I played Pharaoh & Cleopatra for the first time in 2001, as a little kid, I did not appreciate the beauty and complexity of this game, let alone play it properly. It was a window into ancient history, a mysterious masterpiece that fused city building and Egyptian history in a beautiful looking game with incredible music and memorable voice acting. It has stuck with my since I was a child and every time I play it I appreciate it more and get a little further through the challenging campaign, all the while learning more about the intricate history of one of the greatest ancient civilisations. 

Pharaoh & Cleopatra is a city building game from the venerable Impressions series of historical citybuilders, which were important in the early 2000s but sadly went defunct. A bit like a cross between SimCity and Age of Empires, you plan and build ancient Egyptian cities while tending to the needs of your people, building monuments, and interacting with foreign nations and kingdoms, all in a campaign told with immaculate attention to historical detail. They have a devout following to this day. So, the remake, Pharaoh: a New Era, was hotly anticipated. And when playing this game, it captures much of the nostalgia and greatness that was Pharaoh, and its clear that the developers care deeply about the game. 

[b] The Pros: [/b]

Overall, the game has been recreated to a high standard in the aesthetics department, and it is clear the developers care about quality of life and implementing feedback. 

1. Graphics: the graphics have been lovingly overhauled. The buildings and terrain have been kept as close as possible to the original while looking significantly crisper. The game has proper widescreen support for modern systems. One caveat is that the style of the people has been made quite cartoonish. I don't personally find this a problem, and have got used to it. But, I see how some would dislike this. 

2. Music: the music has been recreated to a very high standard. The developers involved the original creators of the music to get the right feel while at the same time making some of the tracks absolute bangers. 

3. Quality of life: small changes like adding the option for global recruitment (added in later Impressions games) make certain annoying things about Pharaoh more manageable. This may be controversial to the more hardcore Pharaoh players. 

4. Developer support: From reading the developers updates it is clear they care about feedback and are actively working to improve the game and bring it more into line with the original. For example, the minimap, previously omitted, has been added back. 

[b] The Cons: [/b]

1. The Military System: Pharaoh has two campaign paths: a military and peaceful option, with a significant degree of overlap. The original military system was somewhat clunky and outdated, but nonetheless was an important part of the game that offered a significant challenge and added to the holistic experience of a simulator of ancient civilisation. Many important missions, such as Byblos, and the famous battle of Qadesh, rely heavily on military management. 

Unfortunately, the developers chose to completely remove the military system in exchange for a half-baked system of ""cutscenes"" which offer no player agency and ""simulate"" the outcome, which is often arbitrary, and the consequences of losing are essentially nil. Instead of controlling vast hordes of chariots on the battlefield, we are shown a laughable ""battle scene"" which involves two cartoon armies walking towards each other for 10 seconds, all presented in a way that makes a Zynga game look like a graphical masterpiece. This means that nearly half of the campaign missions are laughably easy and basically not worth doing at all. 

I appreciate that the developers are working on this, but it's a shame it came out like this.

2. Removed features

Other than the military, there are missing features, which for a remake of a beloved game was disappointing. The ability to rotate the map (AFAIK) is gone. The original game cutscenes, which were very well written, voice acted, and help reward players for completing story arcs are completely gone, taking out the sense of accomplishment from advancing between eras of Egyptian history. The ability to pick Egyptian sounding dynasty names too, while minor, is missing. 

3. The UI 

This is a very subjective point, but one of the immersive features of Pharaoh was its beautiful font and UI, which were depicted in a hieroglyph-inspired style that added to the immersion. 

[b] Overall: A Cautious Recommendation [/b]

I am extremely grateful for the developers for taking on the daunting task of remaking this masterpiece, and for their clear passion for a franchise that deserves broader appeal. It has been a pleasure reliving some of my earliest memories and creating new ones, and I hope that new and old players alike give this game a try. 

Unfortunately, there are a few significant omissions which prevent me from strongly recommending this game to anyone. The complete lack of a functioning military system means that about half of the missions are non-immersive and laughably easy. Some niche features that added to the overall sense of immersion and accomplishment are gone. 

I strongly recommend the original Pharaoh&Cleopatra game to anyone. For those wishing for a graphically revamped version who do not feel strongly about the missing features, this game is excellent. However, I would hold off on buying this remake if you care strongly about military management or an exact replica of the original game, and instead check out the original, which is also on Steam. I suspect that the developers will address these concerns, and in time this remake will become a masterpiece. 

My score for this remake is a 7/10, which would increase to a 10/10 if all the missing features from the original were implemented. 

Note: my hours count is inaccurate, should be ~200h including time played offline.

Sure, there are still bugs here and there. However, I notice that the developers are trying to eradicate them. Furthermore, one simply has to say that the old source code from the original version was not available. Then it is difficult to program everything one-to-one.
And if you're upset about all the bugs, you should show me a game that's currently being released without bugs. Especially since the old Pharaoh also had bugs and these were fixed with Cleopatra and there were also downloadable bug fixes.
I'm sticking with it. I'm glad to be back in ancient Egypt, because the old version just bugs around on my modern Windows computer.

I was a big fan of the original Pharaoh and have played it off and on for the past twenty years. Although an excellent game, it can be difficult getting it running in 4k nowadays.

There are some changes I think should be pointed out:
 - Hotkeys for common buildings - houses, roads, and roadblocks. This is a lifesaver
 - A ctrl-click system to copy an existing building - makes building repetitive blocks far easier
 - There are a set of options you can flick on and off to make the game 'easier' or more like the original. Of these, I love the global labour pool, as well the option to remove the aging workforce and keep it at a constant 40% of population.
 - Gone are the battles of old, now there's an (admittedly glitchy) UI that pops up showing your forces against the enemy's in the field, with no tactics or anything. I didn't particularly like the old battle system so this is fine for me, but I understand people's frustrations with this.
 - No rotation (at all? yet?). Again, this wasn't an issue for me as I didn't rotate my map in the original, but some people won't like this.

One thing I have to call out is the developers dedication - the game launched without a minimap or UWHD support, but has since added both of those.

A last thing I'd like to point out is the music. It has been remastered well! The old music is seared into my memory, and has all been done using modern methods - all inspired by the original music.

All in all, I wasn't 100% sure of A New Era, but after a month or two after release, this is what I'll be booting up when I want to scratch that Pharaoh itch.

Firstly, if you've never played the original Pharaoh, know that this is an HD remake of a very old city builder, the original game is 2 decades old now, and the remake while modernizing some aspects of the game does not change that the game was designed 20 years ago and it will play like a 20 year old game. Go in with this knowledge.

The QOL changes the devs have made are in my opinion very positive. The military changes from the old system are controversial but I enjoy the new system better than the old system overall. The UI is good with a few issues like the alerts being far too intrusive, and the information you're looking for often being buried in menus you wouldn't expect. The graphics are charming and were a nice upgrade to the original game's style. 

There are still some bugs with the game, but at >50 hours on record I have yet to encounter one that was ""game breaking"". The balance of the game is still being actively tweaked by the devs and you can feel in game that some additional tweaking is still needed, but that brings me to the biggest reason I would recommend this game...

The devs have been very active in addressing community concern and patching the game so far. I 100% believe that they will continue to do so until the game is in a healthy final state. If you enjoyed the original pharaoh, or you dont mind learning the ins and outs of a 20 year old city builder with a super cool theme, then this remake is definitely for you. It's absolutely worth your time and money.",1680735067,1680735067,True,49,1,0.773303687572479248,0,True,False,False

I want to upvote this and give it a strong launch, but as it stands while it is fun, I don't know if I can justify getting anyone else to buy it.

First the good. The music is great, I liked the graphics for the most part and the fact they appear to have made a few additional walker lines for certain walkers was a nice surprise alongside old favourites. They also have a comprehensive menu for customising elements between classic pharoah style and modern/easier alternatives. 

But here is the thing; It is buggy; really rather buggy. Take those options; I stuck the original the best I could but when certain things like recruiters taking forever to find workers began I just... had to change back to global pool of workers... Building the pyramids, if part of it accidently pops out the top of the map you can't finish it and have to start over. There are a few other things I noticed; for example it feels like houses goods run out faster, and they are less evenly distributed. It can take a long time for an entire district of houses to upgrade even when normally it would have spread out to all and slowly filled- here houses buy as much as they possibly can, leaving nothing left for everyone else. 

In past Pharaoh I was able to play without roadblocks just fine, here, I needed them. Similar deal with other things, like gods, illness and crime; in the old game I never even saw these happen to often, in this one? I had one temple to each god in both my districts; everyone's religion happiness was maxed but the gods were raining hellfire on me even with monthly temples. Crime wise, even with a police station in each neighbourhood I almost lost because despite being at the very start of the game, my palace and other buildings were getting robbed over and over and over.

Then there is the UI; it really lost its charm and I found it hard to navigate. But that issue plagued the whole game in a way, the lack of a minimap was specifically rather jarring given that the original had one that was more than competent. Even the apparently easier two click building selector took a LONG time to get used to doing. The fact esc didnt' close menus in the UI automatically was also just- a little niggling annoyance. That is the whole UI in a nutshell; take my pyramids, I built one and couldn't easily see the top of it because the strangely placed and wasteful top bar permanently marred the pyramid in all its glory. Notifications were much more loud and in your face than before, and I couldn't even turn them off. So once more my city was often marred by notification popups. 

Then there is like, the missing map generator, the fact they didn't make any bigger map sizes, no additional zoom out (or in) layers; sure you can zoom a little bit, but no more than the base game. It is really strange since in some ways they seem to have gotten TOO CLOSE to the original, and in others they completely threw away the mechanics of the original. I didn't see any new buildings, any new content, anything that really surprised me. Which is fair, but I kinda at least hoped that we'd see a larger map with more monuments, or even just integrating new features like the zoo, lamps, or tomb stocking/robbing from cleopatra into skirmish maps. 

Overall did I have fun with A New Era- Yes.
Do I regret buying it, let alone at full price? No,
Would I feel right actually recommending it to others when compared to one of my favourite games of all time, Pharaoh? No.

I really hope this one improves; also, I saw something somewhere that mods are forbidden? What the hell is with that, I would love to mod this up to the max. It is just depressing we can't.

Edit: I can see they are making improvements; this is good. I will keep watching to see when I think it is time to change my review. Right now, it is still a flawed game; with a little more work we may see it return to form.

The new menu layout has a lot less detail and information than the original.  The music is the same, but re-recorded to be much softer and less noticeable.  There's much less detail in the main game UI and you can no longer right click on empty space to see general information about the ground, or to see what the orangey lumps in the rocks are supposed to be (Gold or copper)


On the whole as my biggest real complaint is;  when it comes to a straight-forward remake of a game like this, I want it to either be all-encompassing (being like the original, plus more, like Left 4 Dead 2 or Payday 2) so it can replace the original without leaving anything out, or distinct enough on its own to be something almost new, so that you can play it and the original without getting tired with one or the other or both.


This game does not achieve either; it has enough quality of life improvements from the original to be worthwhile, but it is not distinctive enough on its own, nor all-encompassing enough to serve as a replacement for the original.


The game is fun, and largely functional.  If you've never played the original Pharaoh, that might be enough.  If you have played the original Pharaoh, you might end up in a situation where you feel nostalgia for it while playing this one, only to feel frustrated by the lack of modern game improvements offered by this one.


Unfortunately for morons like me, that means I feel the urge to play this game AND the original Pharaoh at the same time, alternating between games with each mission.  That can't be helped.



Some of the positive changes done by this game over the original:

- The most obvious, zooming in and out and a larger screen

- More information when clicking on buildings, including a clear indication of whether a building is at risk of fire, collapse, or disease, without needing to use the overlays.

- GLOBAL LABOR POOL - this is what was introduced in the sequel Zeus Master of Olympus, and it is a major gamechanger (for the better)

- More adjustments available in the options, including turning off Global Labor Pool to go back to the original regional recruitment


Some of the negative changes done by this game:

- The main menu system is not as pretty as the original, and has too many PowerPoint-style transitions.  The font is also bland.

- There's no videos between missions or campaigns.

- The UI icons are smashed up against the side of the screen and are very tiny.  Sometimes the pop-up name covers several of the icons so you can't see them.

- There's no longer a central information hub where you can see all the Overseers' complaints all in one place.  Instead they are pushed over to the left side of the screen with separate buttons like the UI.

- The re-recorded music is very soft and anemic compared to the original.  Ancient music was not subtle; it was all loud noise up in your face.  There's no blatty brass, shrill shrieking flutes, or wailing cat-like woodwinds here.  It's all very low-key and muted, less like the fun music of before and more like the elevator music version of Pharaoh.  This alone is almost enough to make switching back and forth between games worthwhile.

- The new overlays don't really make much sense.  Instead of showing you bars indicating whether the level of something is high or low, all it shows you is a single color.  It's not clear what the different shades of color mean or what they're supposed to be.

- I haven't reached a stage that has combat, but from what I hear, they've essentially removed actual combat.  This is concerning.

- Only 4 speed settings; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 5x,  where previously you had 10% intervals between 10% (slowest) and 100% (fastest)



In all, for the average normal person, this is a great remake and just what you'd want.  For an idiot like me, it's a nightmare; both games have different strengths and weaknesses which means I'd have to play both games in order to get the ultimate complete experience.



EDIT:   The new combat system is fine.  It's hands-off, but given how awful the soldier AI tended to be (including situations where your soldiers would just walk past enemy troops,  or a single enemy troop slipping past and destroying half your city while your soldiers were fighting),  this was probably a better decision.


Doesn't matter where you place your forts,  as soon as an enemy invades,  it brings up a Pokemon-style duel face-off screen, which you can skip ahead instantly to a resolution.  This ain't Total War so there's almost nothing lost by doing the battles manually like in old Pharaoh.",1679539199,1680658697,True,1,0,0.475720375776290894,0,True,False,False

Of course having the mini-map back is great but I did get used to just scanning the map manually to look for resources.  

The bugs I experienced were usually ships or storage yard delivery men getting stuck which I resolved by deleting/re-adding the offending buildings.  The most serious bug I experienced was in Baki where my medium pyramid construction kept halting due to getting bugged out - once again the fix was simply to destroy my pyramid and move it to another spot.  Other than these minor annoyances I had a lot of fun playing through the main campaign again and it definitely evoked the same feeling of accomplishment I felt 20 years ago.

--> When it works, it is great. 
Sadly it rarely works well. There are a million bugs and half of them are preventing one from finishing missions. And worse, every new feature seems to introduce more bugs. After finally getting a minimap for example, you can not interact with the ground on the bottom left edge at the map anymore, even when the map has been hidden it cant be clicked. I have had multiple corrupted save files by now. If they are not breaking by some obscure bug, new patches seems to break them. Also by now I've come to dread building any monument what so ever. It used to be my favourite feature of the game, now I am actively trying to avoid it. I had to restart multiple missions after hours of play because they would not continue being build or not becoming buildable after finally collecting all the required resources. I have reached the point where I can not bring myself to restart the latest bugged mission anymore.
The developer seems to be trying to improve things, but the way quality control with this game seems to be handled, it will be a long and bumpy road. For now I can not recommend this game and would refund it myself if I could.",1680199247,1680199247,False,5,0,0.531725108623504639,0,True,False,False

This new rendition is quite nice. I appreciate the improved graphics and some additional features that didn't exist before. My favorite thing is being able to employ workers regardless of location. I remember the massive challenge it was to get workers to those remote parts of the map, to mine gold and other things, all because I needed housing nearby. So this new advantage was a welcome addition.

There are a couple inconsequential buggy things I noticed. In one of the early scenarios, I could build bandstands, but not any juggler or music schools. Also, in another map, it showed I could grow a certain food, but that was not the case. I think I was confused by that. I could trade for additional types of food, but I thought the map shows what I could actually grow.

The ""Battle"" scenes are a bit tepid. I don't care that much because I don't care much for the conflict portion of the game. I stress about forming an army before an invasion. In Saqqara, I learned I waited too long to build an army.

Anyway, I appreciate that this was brought back to life. I had an emulator a while back where I tried to play the original game on my computer, but I couldn't get into it.

Put simply: [b]It's like what Microsoft did with Halo 1 and 2 anniversary editions. The under the hood changes are appreciated, but the design/feel changes are not. It has some comforts that make the game less frustrating. I will say that while it's not quite the same, it is definitely still Pharaoh and draws me in until it's 6am.[/b]

I wish I could go with a meh recommendation, but I'm going to go with Yes for now because I think a lot of my problems can be solved with some patches. But it's still a $23 update to a game from 1999. 

I grew up on Sierra's City Builders and Pharaoh was arguably the one I played most in my childhood:

The Good:
[list]
[*] Feels nice to move around at 120fps.
[*] Overall navigating the world is easier.
[*] Seeing a lot of the world at once on a large screen, though I wish I could zoom further out.
[*] Cloud Shadows is a nice touch.
[*] The info panels you get when clicking on a citizen or animal have unique artwork instead of just a cropped image of the unit.
[*] They kept the same voices for campaign and citizens. Yes, they're compressed but they're iconic for me. I'd rather them reuse these than try to have someone new imitate.
[*] lots of little QoL which rounds over the annoyances of the original.
[/list]

The Meh:
[list]
[*] Music is nice though, I'd prefer to just play the original tracks. That said, after playing for now 20+ hours the music has grown on me a lot.
[*] Visuals are indeed higher fidelity but feel like a cartoon. And I would almost say aren't good enough to warrant even changing them. The movement of citizens is all tweened like a cheap cartoon. Perhaps a option to have animations run at lower framerate. Or go with a sprite style like that from the trailer.
[*] The menu system and navigation feel cheap and that of a mobile game with its needless linear animations. Reminds me of Turmoil. If you're used to how modern games handle going in and out of menus, you will probably become frustrated with how unfluid it is. 
[*] The options menus sometimes have the wrong descriptions for certain changes. The design language makes some things look like buttons that aren't buttons and somethings that don't look like buttons are, in fact, buttons.
[*] The detail on citizens is so much higher than buildings. There is a sharpness difference which sticks out. Like a background versus an animation cell. Buildings look blurry and not what I'd expect for such a recent release.
[*] The loading screen tips go by so fast, but something about ""Ostriches having swag"" wasn't really something that gave me hope.
[/list]

The Bad:
[list]
[*] I KNOW THE BUILDING HAS NO ROAD ACCESS. LEAVE ME ALONE.
[*] No view rotation. Something behind a big building that you can't see? Guess you're stuck.
[*] A fair amount of bugs that only show up a few cities in. The biggest one right now is some industries and buildings just... stop. Weavers, Brewers, Fisheries, etc. They'll have a drop in workers and then recover and have full employment but either do nothing or be given no supplies to work. Delete and rebuild and it works. And then it stops again.
[*]  So many popups and notification sounds. Half the clicking you'll do in this game is closing useless notifications which take over your screen.
[*] Some of the popups can be closed with just right click, even if they're extremely important. you will accidently close lots of stuff you shouldn't be able to.
[*] Original game let you choose what was a pause-notification to get your attention and which were just a small bar at the top.
[*] Hotkeys for overseers which I don't need to check much, but nothing for buildings or roads results in lots of needless clicking. The CTRL+Click to clone a building is good, but this doesn't work on roads, removing structures... or if the building doesn't exist yet.
[*] Game feels flatter and has less distinct character of the original menus styles and overseer panels. Needs more texture.
[*] UI Icons aren't as visually readable and easy to understand as the original game. I much prefer the hieroglyphic style of the original. They just made sense. - [b] some icons have been updated since I wrote this.[/b]
[*] 20+ years later I still can't just build ontop of rubble to replace the building that just burned down. This is a problem with the original game, but cmon.
[*] Oh and I completely forgot... Military is basically completely removed as a gameplay element thus far in my hours in the campaign. Just build a fort and a recruiter and hope you have more than the enemy when they attack. You don't control anything. 
[/list]

It needs some more time in the oven, and stylistically it's not nearly as Sierra. I think the developer unfortunately put too much of their personality into it versus just bringing it as it was to modern players just like Saber Interactive did with Halo1 and 2.

There are still a couple of issues BUT the devs showed that they care about the game. I hope they keep working and improving on it. I would recommend the game but it still could be a better experience so be aware of some bugs and lost features (e.g. map rotation, millitary) if you know the original. 

In many ways the game is true to the original though, which is impressive since it is a complete remake and without access to the source code of the original, they had to deduct how the original game works just by how it is played. They also implemented some quality of life features (like global worker pool), that make the game more accessible but can be turned off if you want to play more true to the original.",1676581214,1679956730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The designers did listen to our complaints (and there were many) and updated the game and were very responsive but it felt like the game wasn't ready to be released.  Many times nowadays games are labeled as Early Access so that the game can be developed with input from us as Beta Testers and I understand that but this one was not like that.  Just be warned in the future to wait at least a month or two after a game comes out before purchasing any game to avoid the hassle factor and bugs.  

Just to list them, there were a multitude of problems with this game originally and it must not have been beta tested at all!  The designers were responsive to my original complaints and some of the bugs were carried over from the original game as I remember, but I never remember having SO much trouble before!  Here is a list of the issues with the game before the patch but after the patch, new issues arose including not being able to load any saved game files that really angered many!  They did finally have a patch to that patch that fixed the new issue.  I can tolerate bugs in a game and understand designers may be stressed post-Pandemic and use us as guinea pigs who purchase games when they come out, but not this many and it was intolerable until finally a month later they were resolved!  Just as a list of them that I encountered in this game over the last month:

1. Save files blew up to 4-6 Gb size and wouldn't load requiring a new restart of the mission losing all of your progress and very annoying.
2. Scribal schools keep blowing up the requirements to be perfect coverage requiring you to have 2, 3, or even 4x the population of children than your present population is even and you can't increase culture enough to win a scenario without restarting it!
3. Cultural advisor gives the wrong advise most times.  Dancers allowed me to vault above the culture requirement often when never mentioning it with their advice.
4. Docks stop accepting trading ships on several missions and the trading ships just float there and do not trade so you are dead and have to restart the mission.
5. Granaries don't accept or Hunting Lodges don't deliver meat to granaries and only allow one food type no matter what you do so you can't increase your housing quality with the two types of food requirement requiring a restart of the mission that sets you back days!  
6. The game all of a sudden crashes and restarts your computer on one mission, Bubastis, for no reason.  It happened several times like it was overwhelmed.
7. Bricklayers and stonemasons sometimes don't show up to work.  You have to destroy their guilds and rebuild them in order for them to start working again and nothing to do with population issues like not enough workers.  
8. Ferries and bridges block all land trade making it very difficult to trade as sometimes the storage yards will not GET what you need across the river to trade.
9. The advisor will tell you people are immigrating to your city but they are not and also gives wrong advice on some of the other issues from time to time.  Manipulation of the tax rate and how much you pay workers did not solve the problem the first few times and required a reload several times until it finally worked which made no sense!
10. Patch to the game that was supposed to fix these issues did fix them but created the save files to not load frustrating many of us that already were frustrated to no end.  

I encountered all of these issues so a beta tester MUST have encountered at least a few of these bugs already and it is a surprise the game came out with all these bugs still present so badly!  Next time, I want to be PAID as a Beta Tester to point out all the bugs instead of used as a guinea pig!  That being said, I liked the original game and liked the concept and artwork and the responsiveness of the designers to the issues of the game.",1679512501,1679953183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I encountered the save corruption bug, on Rowarty, absolute game killer!! Eveything was working fine until one of the patches....then I couldn't play anymore.

The new UI takes a little getting used to, but again they've already made some improvements in this area since release. 

I also love the new global worker pool - rather than needing to have a housing area next to each area of industry, your workplaces now draw on the total number of workers available, regardless of how close they are. I know this might make the game too easy for some players, but the feature can be easily disabled. 

The military side of this has been stripped down to the minimum from the original, but it's not like it was anything special before, and if you're like me, it's more the economy/trade/infrastructure side of city building I look forward to.

As far as how good it is right now the game is mostly passable, I'd still purchase it as I did considering my passion and nostalgia for the Pharoah series and my long desire to have a version of that game with a number of modern QOL sensibilities so if that sounds like you I would recommend taking a close look at the game and read the devblogs and consider if it's worth buying in the state it's in or not, it definitely still has bugs and balance issues so it might be worth watching and waiting.

As for as why I waited to review I wanted to see how the devs interacted with the game post launch, I can say that they seem to be pretty intent on maintaining and building up the game at least a bit which means that the current state of a decent number of bugs and open ended questions about balance is almost certainly going to change for the better, the team is definitely actively taking feedback and while there are some things they can't really fix it's likely that there will be a sustained and concentrated effort to continue patching up Pharoah a New Era.



In conclusion, I recommend the game (always check for yourself if it's a goo fit for you) because of it's appeal to those who liked Pharoah and the impression's game's series of citybuilders, while it is in a pretty mid state that would otherwise be a very neutral opinion the devs are actively working on things and making improvements and what they have to work with (Pharoah) is a very good piece meaning things are looking quite good for the game's health.",1679888215,1679888215,True,4,1,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,False

The new graphics are very nice, but don't really add anything above the original game and is missing in some instances like docks being loaded or unloaded, or pyramid stone placement gangs being different from stone delivery carts.

I have been fascinated with ancient Egypt since I was 11 years old and both the original Pharaoh and now this version go a long way to engaging with that fascination for me.[h1]What I Love:[/h1]- The structure artwork is absolutely beautiful, and I actually watched Triskell's YouTube videos showing how they recreated the structure graphics from the low fidelity '98 graphics into the new graphics. (Worth the watch, especially if, like me, you are a digital artist.)- I really enjoy many of the new mechanics and features they've added, such as:   + Implementing Global Labour from [i]Pharaoh's[/i] sequels [i]Zeus[/i] and [i]Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom[/i], whilst simultaneously keeping the option to use the original labour recruitment system if you so desire   + Allowing you to turn off predators   + Adding upgrades to (some) military structures and units to help increase the protection they offer/ability to fight   + Deciding to make Forced Walkers an official mechanic instead of the accidental oversight it was in the original.   + Sandbox Mode for the campaign missions- All of the  [i]Cleopatra[/i] expansion mission are included in the base game at no additional cost, as are all of the official custom missions- The music sounds much more epic and authentic- Triskell has removed the option to use the Hellenic/Classical names for the cities, which I feel is more respectful to ancient Egyptian culture than calling their cities by the Greek names imposed on them.- The encyclopaedia of information has been updated with the latest information we have about the ancient Egyptians, with a professional Egyptologist on staff to ensure accuracy.- For a newly released game, the price is [i]very[/i] reasonable. You expect most new releases to go for US$60, but this is just over US$20.- Triskell, the dev team, have been very attentive and responsive to fan feedback thus far.- [b]ETA:[/b] As of the latest patch, the missing victory voiceovers I previously mentioned have been restored![h1]The Cons[/h1]In my opinion, there aren't many, but there are still some.- There is a dire need for paragraph breaks in the mission briefings.- There are still a [i]lot[/i] of bugs. Fortunately, Triskell is making Bug Squashing™ their top priority.- Map Editor is currently unavailable, but Triskell is working on that too- Too many clicks required to get to the play screen.- Some cities are still referred to either by their classical or modern names even though the ancient Egyptian name for them is currently known to Egyptologists. I recognise this is probably because Triskell is using the original voice acting (remastered) on mission briefings, but I still would have preferred they changed as many city names to the ancient Egyptian versions as they could.[h1]In Summary[/h1]I am very happy with how the overall game has turned out, despite the issues present. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys City Builders, fans of the original [i]Pharaoh[/i], and any of my fellow Egyptophile gamers out there.** Edited to fix formatting errors.",1679168622,1679737939,True,5,1,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,False

I've been doing this since it came out in 1999.⠀This remake is ... Somehow, worse than a ~25yo game. ⠀I waited for this last update to post a review, but the update's fixes don't change my opinion. You may notice I already have a bunch of hours clocked. I love Pharaoh and the mechanics, and playing it in 4K is still satisfying. I don't know if I love the cartoony art style, but the visuals and music are very true to the original game.⠀That said, somehow, even though it's a quarter century later, these devs still can't just make a decent UI or informational tooltips. The menus are slow to use and poorly-organized. Quick links are lacking that the OG game had. ⠀[hr][/hr]⠀On top of all of that, complex functionality from the OG game are missing. ⠀[b]Examples:[/b] [list][*] Combat in the original game wasn't great, but now, it's TERRIBLE. You just get a bad animation and an RNG outcome table. It's pointless to build walls and gatehouses. Towers only barely influence outcomes. The academy just wastes time. It's so lame.⠀[*] In the OG game, event planners would take increasing amounts of time to plan festivals. This was so you couldn't spam them. Instead, this remake's devs just decided to nerf festival bonuses.⠀[*] Kingdom tribute just isn't a thing anymore, I guess. You can tribute for a few Kingdom rating points. That's it. The pharaoh will never get mad about never giving him anything, and that nullifies the need for a personal mansion almost entirely.⠀[*] Diety interest decay from the OG is now gone. It used to be, even if every god was satisfied that year, there was still always a small decay that meant you had to be vigilant about observing them. Now, once they're satisfied and your population is stable, you can ignore the gods entirely. Note I'm doing all of this on Hard.⠀[*] Once your kingdom is stable, you can just put the game on 5x speed and stop paying attention. Again, this is on Hard. Random & scripted events are even fewer than in the OG. ⠀[*] The game is QUIET. They copied the sounds from the OG, but their triggers are different. You're gonna hear the same annoying crowd-murmuring effect every other minute, while almost never hearing any other sound effect.⠀[*] The city walkers will often complain -- especially about unemployment -- when the problem is so tiny it shouldn't be mentioned. (Even if only 1 dude is unemployed, everyone will act like their building is struggling for staff.) Events also get incorrect responses when triggered, too, such as being shamed by the Pharaoh for not delivering goods in the text (not the outcome), when you were merely late.⠀[*] The gods no longer speed up pyramid building. It's ridiculous. Some missions can take dozens and dozens of game years for no fun reason, all while the city stagnates and you wait for shipments of stone to come in.⠀[*] The (2000) Cleopatra expansion for Pharaoh added tons of little extras, like visual festivals -- where walkers would run around in the festival square to make it feel like a party was happening -- and all that fun stuff is notably missing. [b]It's absolute laziness to leave those little touches out of the game.[/b]⠀[*] Predators used to be hard in the OG, but now, they are pointless to even turn on as an option. Hunters, police, and soldiers just walk by passively while hippos eat everyone on a street. It's so stupid.[/list]⠀[hr][/hr]⠀So, in summary: ⠀1999's Pharaoh was a masterpiece.⠀2023's Pharaoh: A New Age is a higher-resolution but far poorer rendition of the original.⠀Skip unless you're a diehard fan.

Pros: 
- Very nice soundtrack
- The new graphics are nice
- lots of quality of life features that the old game lacked but which are optional and can be toggled off in the menu if you want to play oldschool

Cons:
- it took them until the latest patch to introduce a minimap (why was this removed in the first place?), view can't be rotated
- the military system was turned into an automated cut-scene that is super glitchy and while Pharao never impressed with its military part, this is just ridiculous
- tons of gameplay issues
           -> having multiple docks messes up the trading routes of ships, even if you precicesly tell them what to trade and what not, sometimes ships will simply ignore your docks even if you have enough wares, have not maxed out on yearly exports etc.
           -> random walker issues; magistrates get stuck e.g., houses evolve to lower tiers claiming that a certain service is lacking while you can literally see the guy walking in front of their door, etc.
           -> random plague without warning even though the risk map says all is fine and there are doctors and apothecaries
           -> monuments won't continue to be built because the guild refuses to build ramps even though they have wood and there is a road to the monument
          -> 9+-tile houses take a long time to fill with people, which is by design, but while being under max capacity the city gets angry because of ""slums"" even though you have not a single house lower than the maximum 4-tile and people refuse to imigrate wtf
          -> sometimes games confuses enemy invasions with pharaos wrath and sends you random messages
          -> more related things

I really, really wanted to like this game but even after several patches it is a pain to play, which is a shame.

I AM LOVING the game all over again.

I would give it an 8.5 out of 10

Good changes to the OG: After the lastest patch the interface got much better
Weird changes to the OG: Monument building feels less epic with single carriers with single blocks.
Controversial change: dumbed down military battles. For me it is no problem, but bothers a lot of players of the OG.
What I did not like: the notification system is less annoying after the latest patch but still has a weird popup layout; some of the music rearrangements fells out of place.

In the latest patch several bugs were fixed and better info is exposed about the problems in your city making it clear what is a feature and not a bug.

The most annoying bug currently for me is the monument building visuals. The workers and wooden ramps look out of place and for most monuments upper layers of stone covers the workers.",1677004695,1679492887,True,3,0,0.509740173816680908,0,True,False,False

What I was expecting was new graphic for old game. What I got was not even the old game level but approach is promising. I started to play both, this new game and old Pharaoh again to do better comparison for myself. 

+ graphics is nice on many levels and look of new building for example barracks for soldiers is awesome 
+ global working pool for people
+ pause and building 
+- new music, I would prefer option to choose the old one
+-new combat system looks promising but for now its bugged 
- missing map and rotation
- workers do not move bigger load on monuments in groups also models of people disappearing in monuments most of the time
- 16:10 resolution missing
- police do not fight with animals
- UX is not intuitive as the old one and they have multiple icons for similar categories instead of one, left menu is just unfortunate to navigate in
- game don't give info if you can fulfill request for Pharaoh 
- road around festival square looks ugly even after update on plaza
- in time of festival people are not gathering on festival square and do not dance there
- missing cut scenes 
- organization of good in stockpile is really frustrating when you need to scroll almost all time when you want to set it somehow, just change resolution and number of items for line or let people scale UI
- monuments missing on world map and also armies are not visible there
... and there is much more, BUT developers communicating with us and as far as I see it and hope they will fix/improve that game, so even if it is not perfect now I would like to recommend this game and will update this review in time

Cons
Still many bugs, but less with each patch

Pros:
-Military is gone, and military was probably the worst part of the original. More on this below
-The user interface is improved in some important ways. Keys are laid out better so you no longer have to reach over all the way to spam P, [, ], and anyway you can just rebind them now. You can build during pause (no more jank 10% building), navigate with WASD, roadblock are moved to the main menu, it has an actual functional settings menu, along with various other minor QOL improvements.
-It looks nicer. I prefer the old style in a lot of ways, but the actual quality of the textures is enough better to make up for it.
-The core game is fun. The original was fun so this is fun also.

Cons:
-The military is gone. Now like I said, this was super janky in the original, but not having it breaks the game. After you've played enough maps, learned about housing blocks and forced walkers, the economy side of the game is no longer a challenge. The threat of total destruction from invasion means you actually have to adjust; you can't just use all your money to build the perfect economy, generate 100k Db, and pay off invaders. Having to maneuver troops gives you the chance to eek out a little extra value on the margins. If you control/position your troops better you can build the fort a few months later, letting you invest a bit more into the economy.
-Debt is really the only way to lose, and it's not very interesting. Get to -3k and the debt interest will eat you alive unless you're already exporting a ton of stuff. So it adds difficulty, but this difficulty is totally navigated by just building a bit slower. Instead of building 20 weavers/potters/brewers right away literally just build 4 until your trade ramps up and it's impossible to lose. It kind feels bad, since planning out these stupid mega-bases all in one go is a ton of fun.
-No option to keybind buildings. This one is honestly shocking. All this effort going into modernizing this game and I'm still here manually clicking through the menus every time I want to build something. Why can't I bind road to R!!? It's right there!
-The UI is clunky and feels untested. As a trivial example, when you create a family it shows your name in all caps, but save it and go into the family registry and you'll see it's case sensitivities. My literal first experience in the game is having to make another family for this reason. Now this specific case REALLY doesn't matter, but it's the sort of thing that QA should have caught. The game ends up with a ton of little bugs like this that end up breaking up the flow. Like when you go to the world map you can exit by pressing escape, but then the settings menu shows up. Not big on it's own, just a million little UI inconveniences that lead up to a worse experience.
-The building UI, despite its modernization, is harder to navigate. The 4x3 grid -> text may look old, but having the grid layout means your looking for 'top-left' or 'middle-right' instead of the 5th out of 8 items. And once you select the category you just get the name of the building instead of trying to parse some symbol.

Overall though I'd still say it's fun, just (somehow) less fun than the original. If you have't played pharaoh before and don't feel like dealing with the incredible jank then this is worth a shot. But if you've played before or don't mind the jank, I feel you're better off going through the original.

No. That Genre is dead. It was dead for a long time deal with it.

Game that You are looking at is.... Well let's just say it's a very well made copy and paste version of a game.
Butt! 
Wait!
There's a twist!
The ""code"" of original Pharaoh is lost, at least that the what the people say. So this brave studio... 
Dotemu? (afraid Australia ?!)
Decided to do everything again, step by step, pixel by pixel. Literal copying the original. 
They did... well .. decent.

Before going further remember, I consider this game to be, potentially... first of many, bringing us a good old games, working on your PC without a problem, or no need to patch and mod the game to oblivion.

All in all game is playable and it works with modern resolutions and aspect ratios. IT EVEN WORKS WITH MODERN WINDOWS!!!! (Yeah, tested it myself,no mods no problemo guys)
About the game, If You played the original You will immediately notice lack of the minimap, but over all game offers You experience similar to the original. The GUI is changed and in my opinion easier to navigate, yet it lacks a minimap. 
One of two big features that I miss is the advisors screen, it was changed, from once great screen, that was highly decorated and felt in line with a game. Now we got simple menus witch lacks the style of original, same as game lacks a minimap. 
Second thing I miss from the original was a multitude of voice acting lines, there were couple of recorded lines for every little person in Your city, now i guess there are one or two, but hey... They did not have a time to introduce minimap, so they probably had to cut voice acting as well.
All in all, Complaints above are the biggest one for me, despite them I felt like 11 years old again, and felt urge to... satisfy my urges on the glorious Great Pyramid constructed in my city.
So for example, music in game? dont get me started, KICK ASSSS! As good as original, Music itself makes this game a nostalgic masterpice!
Few voice lines in game, are doing well in keeping the theme and climate of the original. 
There is metric ton of little quality of life upgrades, that help You with the game play.
And most intriguing for me, either my memory is made out of cardboard and swiss cheese, or the difficulty level was increased a bit, because I don't, remember having problems that I have playing that game.
All in all, if You are 30+ and You remember the good old times of city builders, this game is for You, and it's not even that pricy.

- No rotation of map.

- No scenes between missions.

- Sometimes when the song changes, so does the atmospheric sound.

- Objectives screen gives you the mission summary. 
   and...
- Notifcations screen gives you the objectives. :\   

- The walls have no purpose anymore with the new battle-system

- Police don't attack predators, which is a problem.

- When ''notifications'' are deleted so are the objectives of the mission.

- You would think that in the pop-up screens (especially Missions) they would center the text.

- NILOMETER PREDICTION GAME SAVED . Thanks. Can you please not block my view every year? Or ruin my eardrums?  It really isn't that importa A BLESSING FROM PTAH.... 

- The constant repetition of notifications that fill up the screen and need to be clicked away is a tedious battering of the player. It is utterly amateuristic and pathetic.

- Notifications menu must be the laziest screen in gaming history. A border with a button.

- You are not always notified of notifications.

- Info on Palace (and others) disappears (Will be fixed)

- No sound in menus or button presses (Will be fixed)

- Houses don't use pottery (!)

- Lackluster generic buttons for very important advisors and overlays. The original had 
immersion and personality. Here they are hidden behind a very ugly and slow button system. The Kingdom button is a globe (A GLOBE with America on it in 3000BC !!) 
Further genius additions of buttons are the question mark and exclamation point. Fantastic. 
Don't forget the encyclopedia book, because those are all very Ancient Egypt like.
It's not like back in the day they had a very broad language filled with imaginitive characters and pictures we could use, now is there? (Winkwink).

- A BLESSING FROM BAST (when the gods fart or wink you get an unskippable screenfilling notification)

- Where is the mini map?

- Festivals have no visual appeal, there is nothing happening except for a notification. Swell.

- Cities are mostly silent whereas the original was brimming with sounds of buildings and festivities and conversations. Not in this one. What a dull awkward place to live in.

- Pop-ups and info for buildings could be WAY smaller. Now it is screenfilling for no reason.

- Rightclick should be a toggable option, not a given.

- the Delete button (a cross) should be hotkeyed.

- From Men-Nefer on, there's a problem with population not coming to your city.

- Change the cross into a shovel (we all know what a shovel does in these games. 
It has always been a shovel. 

- Why aren't roads clonable.

- I didn't play warfare myself, but what i saw didn't work very well. Units clipping through one another, not responding to other units and in general not acting like a battlefield. I am personally not against simulation, but do it right. When this is the biggest departure from the original you have in your game, make it work and stand-out, otherwise you will get backlash. 
Right now it doesn't work well. I noticed later that there are abundant sound issues as well.
I now know why they didn't show this alteration and i think it was a mistake to implement it in this state. Moreover it is a crime to hide it from the public the way they did.

- The encyclopedia is a chore to read. No pacing. Just a wall of text without edit. Certain words can be clicked on, but it took me a while to notice that this is the case.

- The text and font in this game look awfully amateuristic.

- A BLESSING FROM OSIRIS (Shut up!)

- Again, the abandonment of Hieroglyphs is a travesty.

- Some music is taking too much to the foreground. And dare i say it does sound more Arab than Egyptian?

---------------

I hope the game will be fixed in the future with more feedback from the community.
Until then it is a NO for me. It feels cheap and rushed.

The same as with Lethis. It lacks actual immersion of the subject.
The clouds are a nice edition though. 

But for the rest it is too clinical. It sorely misses atmosphere.
They cut way too many corners in this one. Nebuchadnezzar, made by a two man studio, handled warfare much better than this team did. That game has awesome solutions for challenges of these sort of games. I wished they learned from that.
Instead they added a few extra things (clonable rotatable buildings). but they also skipped many many things that would make the game so much better. 

I do hope my idea about the team gets rectified in the future when they tackle the bugs, soundscpae and awful UI at least. But i don't see much hope shine through in this released edition.

Pharaoh is a statistical code according to this team. 
It should have been a soulful Kingdom to rule.

Pharaoh, the Spreadsheet Edition.

Pharaoh a New Era offers almost NO genuine updates from the 90's original. They updated the HUD Slightly and added some cut scenes for the main menu, and that's about it. 
My main gripe with the ORIGINAL game was the combat system. It was buggy, clunky, counter intuitive and VERY consequential as you had to place flags correctly to protect your palace or your level would be reset. 
I was looking forward to an updated combat system in this remake,  and instead they just fully REMOVED it. Enemy troops DO NOT appear in your city, and your troops ARE NOT active in your city. 
The way you design your city has NO INFLUENCE on its defensability.
A pointless and broken animation plays out your ""battle"" which is just your troops passing through the enemy troops with no collision or death animations. It is laughably low effort, zero-interactivity nonsense. 
Additionally, they have NOT added many new levels or added complexity to the game, truly doing nothing whatsoever to justify the $23 price tag. 
Even the changes to ""walker"" animations have made them less lifelike and more cartoonish, in exchange for being less pixelated than in the original. 
EVERYTHING THAT IS GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME IS WHAT WAS ALREADY THERE IN THE 90's. 
I honestly have no idea why this game would be released in its current state.

However with as with any update and new release there will be bugs and I just ran into my first one. I just completed my stepped pyramid at Saqqara (Old Kingdom Era) and had already exceeded the rest of the victory conditions prior to completion, however despite all of the victory conditions being met the level will not recognize my victory and allow me to progress to the next level. Here are my current stats compared to the victory conditions:

Population: 6450, Needed: 3500
Prosperity: 67, Needed: 15
Kingdom: 98, Needed: 50
Monument: 13, Needed: 13
Stepped Pyramid: Completed

I see that I can bypass this bug by selecting the next level in the individual missions mode, but it's disappointing to put in the effort and meet all of the victory conditions and not have the game recognize the victory and progress to the next level in the campaign as it should. I will continue in the individual mission mode, but I hope this bug is fixed soon and that I am notified when it is.

Small bugs and glitches aside that i hope will be fixed in a patch, I have 1 major issue.

The Combat:

Back when they announced they where changing the combat, i thought it sounded okay.... but in practice, it kinda blows.
There's a health bar in the top left and top right corners, and your armies just un-menacingly trudge towards each other and seem to start in random positions, so if your archers are caught out of..... oh wait, that doesn't matter because the health bars mean nothing, and when the units fight, it also means nothing, so you can just skip the battle screen to find out if the computer decided that you won or you lost.
And i swear Seth is way more willing to just murder death kill every enemy sent against you than he used to be, which ultimately leads you to a combat system where enemy soldiers are just not a threat and the system as a whole ultimately means nothing.
meanwhile in Pharaoh + cleo, enemies attacking your city could potentially do some big damage if your unprepared, hell, they might even destroy you and force you to restart the level!
Also you can get rid of predators anymore, so they have free reign to munch on your civilians, or at least they would if their animations actually worked :D 
but you can just turn predators off which is a bit of a boring fix.

Also, hate the lack of the mini map, but i hear they're gonna be adding that at some point, so huzzar!
speaking of UI related things though, i don't get what was wrong with the old UI design, they've modernised it in such a way that it just feels really foreign, but maybe that's what you get for having played the original since the early 2000's.

And the final gripe i have, so there's essentially 3 game speeds, 1x, 1.5x and 5x, woah, why the huge leap? replace 1.5x with 2x, and we're good :P

All in all, they marketed it as a Full Game, but it feels like an Early Access.
I want to recommend it thought, because even with the bugs, glitches and the changes both big and small, I have still had a lot of fun, but the recommendation comes with the caveat of....

My only main concern is that some of the campaign objectives are unclear. As an example, I sat on my Saqqara (Old Kingdom) city in the campaign for far longer than I should have (even deleted and rebuilt my pyramid) after being confused about why, after meeting all of the stated objectives, the campaign wasn't progressing. Apparently, burial arrangements were required once the pyramid was built.

Based on the discussion forums, I'm not the only one that was confused by that. I think the campaign objectives need more clarity and I wish there was a way to minimize the number of pop-up notifications that constantly pause the game (maybe pop-up but don't stop time). There are a good deal of typos as well (particularly the loading screens). I also wish there was a way to see how much of the population was about to age out of the workforce ahead of time.

The bugs that prevented me to enjoy (or even simply play) the game have mostly been fixed !! Since the new patch, I played maybe 30 hours, and I've only encountered 2 or 3 issues, which I honestly don't mind as most games often do.

This allows me to do a full review of the actual game, instead of just saying ""too bugy to play"".
So, in short : I enjoy it a lot.
The main difference with the old one is the battle aspect. For me, this has never been a force of the old game, so I truly enjoy having it VERY simplified, as it was not the reason that I played in the first place. If you enjoyed the old military system, you might be frustrated. 
Other than that, it is a cleaned up version of the old game ! The thumbnails of the different businesses are a bit confusing, as they kinda look like each other, so it takes a bit of getting used to to be fully comfortable, but it doesn't hinder my enjoyment of it all. 
The music seems to be divisive, but as for me, I LOVE IT !! It is a bit startling at first, but I genuinely really enjoy the epicness of it all. 

I'm rooting for the team behind it !

FYI I'm as far as Byblos in the main campaign, and I've not tried the sandbox mode, so I cannot say on that. 

Old review :

I really, really wanted to love this game, I've been waiting for it since its announcement, and I loved the old one. 
I'm gonna change my recommendation if they fix the many, many bugs, but as of right now I cannot in good conscience recommend it to someone. 
Yes there are some changes here and there from the old one, mainly the military, I don't really mind those to be honest. But I do mind the CONSTANT 
- ""There is something wrong with your save"", 
- the sudden stop of importing or exporting papyrus or else, 
- and the most infuriating bug of them all : the pause being activated at the beginning of EVERY MONTH. 

I'm still gonna play it because I really enjoy it when it goes smoothly, but you should really wait before buying it.",1677489966,1678825303,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I recommend this game IF you already love Pharaoh, and have been wanting to replay it for years but can't stand letterboxing it on your 4k.

Other than that, they really should've called this game Early Access because---it is. I'm on a campaign mission where I start with a partially destroyed city. It's cool! Walls, gates, excellent storytelling. But as of March 2023, no point to rebuilding those walls. No combat system implemented yet!
Minimap? Next patch.
Camera rotation? Not even sure.
(both in the original game mind you)
Achievements? Good luck. Might take reloading your save to randomly unlock some. Some may not unlock at all yet.

In the long run, I think this speaks well of the potential of the game. To me it suggests they're doing a from-scratch rewrite, albeit with access (I presume) to the original sourcecode to make sure they implement the AI and whatnot faithfully. As opposed to some kind of emulate-and-shoehorn-in-4k-sprites approach, the clean-sheet path will hopefully in time allow this game to be all the original Pharaoah was and a good deal more if the players and devs are up for it. For now though, it's definitely a Work In Progress.

Nonetheless, I'm glad I bought it to be here for the journey towards greatness. The cities look magnificent. The art style for the citizens was jarring at first but I've grown to enjoy it. Several of the new QOL improvements are excellent! To me, the option to use a global labor pool makes the game feel more realistic -- especially on maps small enough that reed gatherers or woodcutters will happily go clear across it for work I can't imagine people would want to live within a hundred meters of work instead of a 10-minute walk away in a beatiful neighborhood with parks and jugglers.

For starters, there is no mini map yet, and you cannot rotate your view either which at times can be frustrating, mostly because the UI might get in your way sometimes.

Battle system as we knew it was removed, so it is no longer fun to build up your forts strategically to fight the enemies showing in the corners of the map, that doesnt matter anymore.

Trade doesnt seem to work just how its supposed to be. And as you go further in missions that need to build monuments and import good for them then you are going to sit in front of your PC for a very VERY very long time which just takes away most of the fun of the game.

3. Battle mechanics are really bad
4. Constant immigration problem (solved)
5. City icons on map are to confusing and overlapping; make cities more interactive and bring possibility of sending gifts or asking for gifts from other cities. Put ancient Mesopotamia, Assirya and Hittites on the map.
7. Various bugs: recruiter stops working randomly etc...

Pros: 
1. Beautiful graphics
2. Nostalgia

I will be updating my recommendation once one glaring issue is resolved, but more on that later.

First I would like to say there is no longer any RTS combat in the remaster. The devs have made the decision to remove this entirely. At first I felt outraged enough to go play the old Pharaoh again. 
After some deliberation I have come to realise why this decision may have been a better temporary solution than overhauling the entire combat system. It was a mess, a fun mess, but still not really a balanced experience at all. 
You are basically encouraged to make use of existing exploits that the system presented as ""tactics"" once the enemy decided to arrive from a random direction on the map with multiple enemies occupying the same space..

HOWEVER now to the part that is crazy to me. Since the combat has been dumbed-down to the point where you cannot even move around squads anymore, then why would you make it so predators are still set on by default?

The animations are so scuffed now that it seems some of the RTS elements have been removed that you cannot see when/if your police are fighting crocs or hippos...

Your only option as of right now seems to be setting predators off in the menu settings, since you cant send out the soldiers to deal with them

Until this whole mess with the predators are fixed I can't recommend this remake

Also hope the bugs which were not a part of the original gets fixed soon, and can only hope something better comes of the combat system

That said its is still a city builder game at heart, and Pharaoh will always have a special place in my heart, that's why I am rooting for the devs",1678551974,1678551974,False,35,0,0.773700952529907227,1,True,False,False

I have not experienced any game breaking bugs. My only real gripe is with how battles are handled,  it seems like an after thought. I do understand that the game is not about the battles however some player interaction would have added value to the game, or at least a better animation of troops fighting. 

The remake is mostly faithful to the original, the game is massive and is a nice period city builder with some lite management on the side. A nice escape that can be picked up and put down as you like. The soundtrack is soothing, the game play is low stress. Monuments take forever to build but there is plenty of fluff to fill those gaps in missions, you can streamline your trade, pretty up your city, click on randos or just watch hippos and crocs kill more of your residence than any other cause known to man.

Loosely based on historical record, fun economy without being too complicated, pleasing aesthetic and pretty much one of the best ways to unwind after work iv found in a long time.

I say this to preface this with, I am familiar with the mechanics of this game. The Sierra city builders were not identical, but very very similar.
The problem with these exact game mechanics is that they don't really follow modern design sensibilities. Because they aren't modern games. 
If you, like me, played any of the Sierra city builder games, then you will feel right at home here, and you will love it to death.

IF you have NOT played the Sierra city builder games, and didn't grow up with them, I think its very important that you read this next part carefully.
This is not a city building game like SimCities or Cities: Skylines; this is a resource management and production chain management game. You can not try to build good looking cities. The game WILL punish you SEVERELY for that.
Your goal is to build EFFICIENT cities with well thought out supply chains to make sure goods are produced and go where they need to go while travelling the least distance possible.

The pros: The only positive thing I can say about Pharaoh: A New Era is that it captures the look and feel of the classic City Builders of the '90s. All of the traditional elements are here; planning your layout, dealing with Kingdom requirements, the Gods and commerce, making sure your citizens are happy and well-fed and all of the other basic elements of the original game are all well represented.

I've seen a few reviews that put down the app-like graphics but honestly, what were you expecting? The new graphics are fine.

The Cons: in addition to the many bugs, the game just seems incomplete. It's not in Early Access and for $22.99 a game like this should play well enough without wondering if they left off some features.

At the time of this review, the development team has committed to providing the game with a minimap and a wider zoom out feature but I feel like those things should have been included in the game in the first place. Also missing is the ability to rotate the camera and from the way they designed all the structures in the game it doesn't seem like that feature will ever be added.

At 100 hours in, I am running into broken or missing features on every mission I play. Culture is broken or calculated incorrectly. Pathing or commerce at docks is broken. The yearly inundations are busted. A city of 8000 has 65,000 children. Stuff like that.

I bought the game at the introductory discount. I don't feel cheated so much as just disappointed. I'd have paid $29.99 and waited six months for a game that felt more complete.

I've easily logged a thousand hours of playtime - so there, now you've been warned that this review comes from an unabashed fan-boy. Many others have left reviews comparing and contrasting this remake with the original, so I'll leave a review for those of you who have never heard of it:

What this game is - 

Pharaoh is a relaxing, slow-paced city-building sim with just enough depth/strategy to keep you busy, and well-balanced challenges that scale up slowly so that you don't get bored. Once you've figured out a good system for designing neighborhoods and keeping your citizens happy, the maps become more complex and harder to build out. Once you master goods production and trade so that you're making tons of money, trade gets more complicated and Pharaoh starts demanding goods be donated to other cities. Your armies will crush invaders early on, but soon they get harder to defeat and you're required to send troops to neighboring cities while continuing to defend your own. Eventually you'll find it difficult to balance all these competing needs and find your city in chaos; plague strikes, you lose a battle, run out of money, or the gods destroy some your stuff in a fit of rage. No matter - Pharaoh makes auto-saves on a regular basis; you go back to when things were good, try a different strategy, and move on. This game never feels punishing or frustrating, there are a *ton* of tips, walkthroughs, and videos online for each level, you can tweak a number of settings, including the overall game difficulty to get by, or if you've had it with this level just turn on cheat codes and breeze through.

Once you get the hang of it, your cities become beautiful ""ant farms"" of activity. Your workers move through the map, going about their daily business and your housing evolves as the quality of life improves, from crude mud-huts to colorful, sprawling estates, with multiple models for each level of housing to keep the map looking vibrant. You can lay out a variety of gardens, statues, and inlaid road plazas to beautify the city. All the while, incredible monuments of Egyptian history rise slowly into the sky on the backs of laborers and craftsmen, until they tower over your city in their (presumably) historically-accurate splendor.

Lastly, you have very fine control over aspects of your city. You can control where many workers go during their daily routine, raise and lower taxes or labor costs, set limits to how much you import or export, prioritize certain categories over others, and even turn off entire industries or stockpile their goods instead of using/trading them. You can also talk to *every*single*person* on the map; every worker, priest, juggler, soldier, trade caravan, merchant ship, and market boy you see. They don't always have something useful to tell you, but they'll give you insight if something is lacking. The amount of micro-management you can do in this game is limited only by your patience.


What this game isn't - 

This is not a combat-oriented RTS. The battles and the military systems have never been a robust feature of Pharaoh, especially now in the remake (although the devs have announced upcoming changes to this, we'll have to wait and see what they do).

Beating this game is not a badge of honor; it's not terribly difficult once you know what you're doing and while you can make it more challenging in the settings, anyone can master it on normal difficulty.

This game does not lend itself to speed-running. I'm sure *someone* is speed-running Pharaoh and I might even enjoy watching that on video, but expect to spend hours on each level. This is a game where you can sit down with a snack and a drink, guide the city to victory as needed, and then watch it all unfold.


Finally - 

This game has bugs. Some of them are harmless and I hope they get fixed, some of them cause a complete breakdown (I'm looking at you, pyramids) requiring you to reload a save. So far I haven't run into anything that lost me more than an hour of progress and some things that look like bugs actually turn out to be my fault for forgetting some of the finer mechanics. The original game had many of these bugs as well, it's just a natural consequence of systems this complex. The important thing - and the reason I've waited to write this review - is that the devs are *working* on the bugs. They issued one patch two weeks after release and just announced another one yesterday. They're also adding new features and QoL improvements; if they keep it up, I'll have no complaints.

The combat system i really don't understand,  its almost oversimplified the warfare aspect of the game in terms of predicting which of the 2/3 spawn points the enemy will appear from and i have yet to sit through an entire battle because the animations are pointlessly simplistic. 

The notifications are way too close to the middle of the screen and far too big considering i'm playing at 1440p 3 notifications shouldn't take up half of the screen area

I don't like the build menu at all, there was nothing wrong with the original and some of the categorisation doesn't make any sense to me anymore. 

Another change i cant understand. If i have no capacity in my storage yards or granaries why do the workers float in the flood planes for a year until there is either room or the next harvest occurs. In the original if the flood came and your workers hadn't got off the flood planes they were toast. what was wrong with that?

overall i like some of the changes but other make absolutely no sense to me at all and i dont really understand why it took so long to change unnecessary aspects of gameplay. there are also some weird graphical bugs in the monument building process but i'll wait on a patch to cover that one but again if you had given us more levels in the beta you could have solved all of these problems 2 years ago. 

If you are a fan of the original as i am then you will probably play this version regardless as playing with wide screen mods isnt the best but i dont see this appealing to many new comers if i'm honest. the price was bang on though so no complaints there.",1678285504,1678285611,True,1,0,0.494709014892578125,0,True,False,False

Still just relishing playing this classic from my childhood again but actually understanding the game these days. Make sure to not make the same mistake I did and do not build your monuments so the top is going off-screen as your stonemasons wont be able to finish. Also check every now and then that your docks are working properly if not delete them and remake.


HINT: If you are struggling with logistics in the game, it helps to build storage yards/granaries near your collected food/resources and trading locations (ports), where the storage yards/granaries are on ""Accept None"" mode for everything, but then on ""Accept All"" for the one specific resource it is close to receiving. Then you put more storage yards/ granaries across the map closer to the buildings that consume resources such as your bazaars near housing and put these storage yards on ""Accept None"" again, but ""Get All"" mode for the specific resource you need in that location such as food, pottery, beer ect, using a different storage yard for each good.

This method forces the carts in your storage yards to do the hard miles of transporting goods to where they are needed instead of your port workers or bazaar workers travelling far to get them. You can also tell your ports to only trade certain goods so if you place more than one port the ships don't try to all trade at the same port. You can then place storage yards for each specific traded resource by the correct port. This also helps with monument building, putting plenty of storage yards on ""Get All"" for the construction resource such as stone, close to the monument being built.

It definitely helps to have your storage yards on this game specialise on one resource at a time otherwise your workers go all over the place to get what they need and most storage yards will fill with useless stuff instead of what you need. If storage yards are on ""Accept All"" they will just 'accept' goods but if they are on ""Get All"" they 'go get'! Also if you pause the game when you place storage yards and press ""Accept None"" while paused, it stops idle carts rushing to put other goods in there. If it's a mission with gold mines place your Village Palace as close as possible to the mines as to not slow gold production because production buildings pause until their resource cart returns to them.

I don't mean to suggest the game is [i]bad[/i].  Balancing population, production, distribution, etc. as you lay out your city works pretty well.  It's also fairly pretty.

But there are some rough spots.  The inability to rotate the map is annoying; some of these larger buildings block your vision of smaller structures, roads, etc.  Trying to unsnarl trading by water is a headache; ships will stack up forever without multiple docks.  Occasionally getting half a dozen pop-up messages in a row that freeze the game till you click through them all is a pain in the ass.  

The afterthought that is the military is particularly weird.  Yes, the City Building series was always a bit clunky on that score, but they made steady improvements over the various games.  Why wouldn't you add at least the improved functionality from later games when doing a remake 20 years later?  Better yet, why not actually make it better?    

However, it's the monuments that really gum up the works.  Even if you start work the moment you start a new map, it takes [i]forever[/i] to build even a small pyramid.  The rest of the city can be humming along just fine, but the monument creeps along.  While I respect that building a massive stone structure was a major undertaking in real life, watching the agonizingly slow process drag along for years of in-game time is not fun.  

Part of it is the sheer amount of raw materials each item takes.  Even if you can produce it on the game map, it takes ages.  If you have to import the bricks or stone through trade, it's even worse.  Waiting for deliveries is like watching paint dry. 

The only option you have is to crank up the game speed, but even the 5x max isn't enough to make it interesting.  Meanwhile, you have to keep an eagle eye on everything else lest some random in-game event in the background disrupts a supply chain.  At max speed, such a hiccup can devolve your housing and cause a mass exodus before you can react.  Rebuilding the population afterword just adds further delay.  Bleh.  

Without the monument grind, I'd give a modest thumbs-up to this.  It's far from perfect, but it has enough of that old school charm to be fun.

However, the bugs in the game really detract from the enjoyment of the game. They don't seem to bad at first but seem to get worse as you progress due to the cities getting bigger and bigger in the later stages of the game, making the bugs much more pronounced. To name a few:

-Multiple docks are crucial in the trade heavy cities especially when items need transporting a long distance. In the original the trade ships would just go to the next available dock. Here they all seem to queue for the same dock causing a backlog. Further, after removing the superfluous docks some of the trade ships just stayed stuck on the map afterwards, never leaving for the entirety of the mission. 

-There is a strange bug that results in city sentiment dropping low due to too many slums. I have the global workforce option (love this option) enabled so have zero slums in my city. Indeed, this often occurs when I have the highest levels of housing. Still, I end up with emigration resulting in a death spiral to the city. The only solution I have found is to set taxes to zero and increase wages to counter. Once city sentiment comes back I can put these back to normal. Fortunately this happens when the city is doing well and I have the cash to deal with the problem in this way.

-Sometimes the wanderers from service buildings just stop, such as the physician. Problem is this is random and I only notice when the housing devolves as a result. The only solution is to delete the service building and replace.

There have also been a few serious game breaking bugs as well, corrupt saves and missions with missing objectives meaning you can't complete/progress. Fortunately these seem to have been fixed. I will continue to play the game and love it, but these bugs that exist make it really hard to recommend, which is such a shame.

I can only hope that in time the developers will fix these issues. It is so disappointing as they don't seem too major to fix, I am not a developer though.

Level design -- The export/import balance is a mess. Irrelevant trade and not being able to export when you're the big producer of a product is a major issue.

Lack of sandbox diversity -- this is a big one -- they've got a ton of maps, but only a few grand pyramid ones. Stop hamstringing the player. Most of us are coming here for the sandbox, focus there.

It took FOREVER to find out where everything was.  Far more than the measly 2 hrs you allow to return a game.
There are only 3 levels of difficulty, not 5.  
I was unable to pass Tinma for example, in 5 tries.  In ALL the decades I've played this game from inception, way back when, that's only happened a handful of times.  There simply is not enough funds to build housing, temples, phys, forts, mines, and have enough people to fill those jobs without running out of money before your copper industry really gets going.  Gold doesn't help because alas, it requires bodies to work.  Perhaps if we could sell all those gems...but that was never an issue in original Pharaoh.  I won't waste my time trying to ""pass"" something I can do in OG Pharaoh before the first battle ever occurs.
""A New Era"" is not fun.  It is not thrilling.  It is a complete letdown.  I expected things to be some different, but not to the extent that it's virtually impossible to play.  If Tinma is giving me grief what in the world will Charioteer levels be like?  Perish the thought.
There are CONSTANT screen prompts, very distracting.  We can't run game at 100 speed.  There are 4 speed choices, that's it.
Understand here that it was not impossible for me to get huge scores before, something I pride myself on.
I cannot stand behind a product that doesn't function well.
It is clear this game was released before you were thoroughly ready and had ironed out all the bugs.
I experienced multiple freezing episodes.  I also noticed there are an exceedingly high number of saved game files.  ""my egyptian city"", autosave, etc. should suffice.  But no.
There's nowhere to see what your score was.  It shows you ONCE.
I requested a refund less than 14 days of ""playing"" this game, before I started Timna.  Because I had ""played"" 10hrs at that time, I was refused.  ""playing"" is a relative word people.  If it takes you multiple hours to find buttons, press pause multiple times, click buttons to see what they ""do"", that shouldn't actually count as play time.

There's a lot of good and bad in the game, but I feel the bad currently outweighs the good:

THE GOOD:
- The maps are lush and pretty, and the art style is vibrant. The characters look a bit goofy, but the animations are nice and I like the voice acting. That said, this is the bare minimum I'd expect for a remake of a 20+ year old game. I'd expect the graphics to be high definition and clear, and they are. Well done.
- Generally, it's faithful to the original game when it comes to gameplay. You still have the same buildings, same general direction, and a person who played the original game will find it relatively easy to play the remake. There's some QOL changes (roadblocks, global labour pool) that greatly improved upon the game, but are not new to other games by the original developers (Zeus, for instance). 
- The new soundtrack is nice. It's pleasant while playing, and I haven't had the impulse to turn it off or mute it at all. 
- The option screen is much more fulsome, and there's plenty of, well, options to tweak things. My favorite is the ability to make it so certain buildings don't automatically accept all goods by default. That makes tweaking buildings like bazaars and whatnot to my liking mid-game.
- I do appreciate the extended campaign and the renaming of the levels. 

THE BAD:
- Others have said it, but so, so, so many bugs. This is what ultimately led me to lose interest in playing the game after a while. After the first few campaigns I started to notice numerous issues that would pop-up, such as with immigration, trade, and pyramids not being able to be built if part of them are off screen. For the amount of time this game was in development, I would've expected it to be thoroughly bug tested, but it doesn't feel like it. The original games went through lengthy alpha and beta testing periods. This feels like an early access game marketed as a finished product.
- There's a lot of content missing or messed up. The labels on the world map are congested and hard to follow. There's plenty of text that hasn't been put in yet, and instead just references to code. The reference book is plagued with errors and incomplete; the documentation feels very simple and would be hard for a new player to the game (or its original) to find information on basic game mechanics. The graphs are all missing labels. The lack of content gives the feeling that the game was rushed for release.
- This is an aesthetic issue, but I think a fair one: the font and symbols used for the game are generic. The original game's font was also somewhat of a pain to read at times, but in this case there's just nothing not generic about the text or symbols used. I heard someone once refer to the symbols as ""generic corporate icons"" and the font as ""the type you'd find on a boring essay"" and that is true for this remake, too. 
- There's still a lot missing from the original game which inexplicably hasn't been included. No minimap. No ability to rotate the map. The option to zoom out and in are limited, so it's easy to miss resources on the sides of the map because the UI is blocking part of them. There's no cutscenes, or immersive messaging in the game outside of a narrator reading the opening objectives for each map. The workers pulling sleds for monuments is gone. These are just a few of the things I noticed. As a result, doing map after map starts to feel a little boring since there's little to make you feel particularly excited. And when you know that the map coming up may be broken, why bother?
- Pathfinding needs improvement. Others have mentioned how trade ships only go to one dock, but I've also noticed how traders in general have issues getting around your city. Some workers don't choose the best route to get to the building they're needing to get to. While it's nice to be able to see the spawn and despawn points for walkers, it would be nice to be able to change them, too.
- There's numerous graphic glitches which, honestly, could have been fixed before the game launched had there been a thorough testing of the game, but, well, it doesn't seem like it was thoroughly tested. This is especially true for walkers that go through gates, for instance.
- While the new soundtrack is good, the city is otherwise lifeless as far as sounds go, which is odd for this game. The original game, and others like it, gave you ambience for the city, with different buildings giving you a different sound if you zoomed or focused on them. There's nothing like that in this remake. 
- Defensive structures are redundant, and the military system feels like an afterthought. I personally didn't care for the original game's military system - it was quite buggy - but the current system in this game just feels like an add-on later in the game's development. It's just a screen that pops up, you click a button, and lo' you've either won or lost a battle. You have no way to determine strategy, or to affect the battle in any way even with this simplified system. It just seems to come down to, mostly, whether you have more soldiers than the other guy, and any military strategist will tell you that most battles aren't won just by numbers. The change in the system from the original game has also made defensive structures worthless or less useful (ie. walls don't do anything so why build them?). It's also impacted predators, because they just go on killing because there's no soldiers to kill them. Did the developers not think to use the policemen instead? It's the latter part that gets me. Something like that would've been easily discovered if the developers did a beta test of the game ahead of time, but now the game suffers post-release because something as simple as ""hmm, maybe we should have a way to kill the predators"" wasn't addressed ahead of time. So, then, why would players even have the option to turn predators on?
- My biggest gripe with the game, as it is right now, is that there's often no indication from the game if you've done something wrong, or correct, or that there's a problem. You get tons of notifications, but they don't actually explain how you could fix things. Your overseers often only give you vague ideas what to do, and not catered to your current situations - the suggestions seem generic, no matter what your game is like. After the first few maps, the learning curve of the game goes up so much that you can easily lose a map because you don't know what to do and haven't been given any guidance. I'm not expecting nor would I want the game to hold my hand, but I would expect it to tell you what you did that is wrong and how you might fix it. I'd also expect the game to give better direction, and clarity on what you need to build monuments, advice on where to put certain buildings, and so on. But there's just nothing of the sort here, and that can be a problem...
- ...because one of the major issues this game has is that you can fail some missions without even knowing you've failed them. There are some missions where if you fail to accept some materials from a neighboring town early on, they will cut off trade and there's no way to get that trade route back. Unfortunately, later in the same mission, you will find out that you needed that trade route to beat the map. So, you will have wasted possibly hours on a mission that was already unbeatable early on, but the game never tells you. The game doesn't allow you to fix these types of innocent 'mistakes'. There is no way to beat the mission but to cheat or try again, and honestly, why would you try again? What a waste of your time because of something that was not at all your fault because you didn't know it was a problem? God, it's so utterly frustrating to lose a mission this way, and all because this game suffers from a lack of telling you what's going on and giving you user specific information that might help you. 

All of this just doesn't make me want to play the game anymore.",1677966221,1677968227,False,283,2,0.931374430656433105,0,True,False,False

The original Pharaoh was the game that made me love city builders and when I saw that it was being remade with modern systems in mind, I was excited to revisit one of my old favorites again. While this title keeps in the spirit of the original, the execution of it leaves much to be desired. Maybe I'm a little spoiled in that I remember the days of gaming before the internet. When you brought those disks (later discs), home you could feel confident that the developers had thoroughly tested their software and what you were getting wasn't going to have any show-stopping bugs (we won't talk about Ultima IX).

Nowadays, developers routinely publish games that have only been through the most superficial QC process because they know they can rely on the gamers to inform them of bugs and they can then push out updates over the web. Often, these titles will be listed as ""early access,"" so that we gamers know that we're likely going to see flaws in the program. When you know that going in, your expectations are lower and many of us are happy to know that our feedback is making the game better. It's when titles aren't listed as ""early access,"" but the product hasn't gone through a rigorous QC and is, thus, riddled with bugs, that we get frustrated. Unfortunately this remake of Pharaoh falls into that latter category.

Yes, it's great that the concepts in the game are what I remember from the original, but there are so many bugs, and odd decisions made by the developer, that I can't keep playing it anymore. It's ruining my memory of this beloved classic. Here are just a few of the key issues that have me disappointed in this game:

User Interface
---------------
Navigating the main menu is tedious and there's no quick way to close the game. Most other titles give you the option to quit the game directly from the gameplay interface. Pharaoh requires you to quit out of the current mission, then you have to manually navigate back through a couple of sub-menus until you're back to the title screen. From there, you can exit the game.

In game, simple quality of life features, some that existed in the original 20 years ago, are not present. Specifically, things like the mini-map or the ability to rotate the map to it from different angles. I've read that this was a decision made due to ""technical limitations,"" but it's extremely important for any city builder game.

Odd Gameplay Choices
-------------------------
The original Pharaoh had a fun combat mechanic. Where you placed your forts and how you reacted to threats made a difference on what was damaged during an attack. This version just takes all the troops, and does some dice rolling to determine whether or not you are victorious (it's also FAR too easy to win engagements even with an undersized force, unless you are sending them to assist another city, then if they're not 100% you're almost guaranteed to lose them all). If you do manage to be defeated on an attack, the raiders typically destroy your city palace, family mansion, courthouses and any tax collectors. The rest of your infrastructure remains untouched. Additionally, the use of walls and gates doesn't seem to have any impact on the outcome, so why even include them?

On several maps, the trading interface will allow me to import goods that I can't: a) use on the current map, or b) export elsewhere for profit. This makes me ask why: a) those goods are even included, or b) there's no option to build a production facility that uses those goods. If I can import reeds and I need papyrus, but I can't build papyrus makers, or export the reeds to a city that wants them, what's the point? Yes games should make you think, but they shouldn't present you with dead-ends.

Oh So Many Bugs!
--------------------
Let's start with the most frustrating one. After getting the city set up so that it's profitable, bringing in the resources needed to build monuments, and having construction underway, it is demoralizing to see the completion of a monument stall when it's on the verge of being done.  Turns out, if you place your monument site at such a point where the top of the monument will extend outside the UI, the game can't finish building it. Similarly, in some maps where you have to build multiple monuments, attempting simultaneous construction (even if you have the necessary labor and resources) will cause the production to just stop. More often than not, this requires restarting the map, not because you met defeat criteria, but because the game just doesn't handle certain use cases.

On several missions, I'd be given ""gifts"" from Pharaoh or neighboring cities as thanks for my assistance. More often than not, these gifts would be in the form of resources that: a) I could not produce anything with on the current map, or b) couldn't even export. They were truly worthless and would take up space in my storage yards. On a couple of occasions, refusing the gift, or letting it expire caused me to lose kingdom standing because I didn't accept it. Yes, I know in real life people can be offended if you refuse a gift, but this is a game, and being forced to accept something just to throw it away isn't fun, nor does it add to the gameplay at all.

It's far too easy to manipulate the gods. Any map with options to build temples or temple complexes to Ptah are ripe for exploitation. Build a bunch of storage facilities that are specified to accept raw materials (except stone for some reason), an extreme number of temples to Ptah, and throw him festivals. Very quickly Ptah will fill up the storage yards with whatever goods you've said it should hold. This makes these maps far too easy and even when I'm not TRYING to game Ptah, I still end up with overfull storage yards. Making those maps simply just me sitting and waiting for the monument to be built, or the population numbers to hit their target, which is BORING!

Bottom Line
-------------
Once the nostalgia of returning to a beloved classic wears off, you're left with a game that too far too many shortcuts in its development and seemingly skipped its usability testing phase before being launched. As much as I WANTED to love this game, it ended up feeling like a cash grab for people like me who wanted to revisit something that gave lots of joy in the past.

The remake has changed some aspects from the original but in contrast to some of the other reviews, I think these changes are positive. 

The quality of life improvements are very useful and I find it makes the gameplay a lot smoother than the original. Having the option to pull from a general labour pool makes planning cities much easier as it's easier to keep my industry separate from my residences (though if I ever feel like playing the old way the option to use recruiters is always there). The extra icons on the warehouses (and in some of the overseer menus) also make it easier to visualise what I'm doing. The new artwork is bright and beautiful and the new artwork of the characters is lovely!

Another aspect that I like is that the original is still up for hardcore fans (which most companies don't do when they release a remake).

I spent almost 4 hours in this game, making my way through the initial tutorial campaigns.  The pros are, it's a polished Egypt Period City Builder which is remastered enough to hold your attention.  Despite the nostalgia, few of us actually want to play the original versions of old beloved classics.  It's nice being able to get that experience in a truly remastered way, packaged in a client which is both modern and light on system resources.

Cons - A few things stand out, like the fact that frequent and repetitive notifications can't be disabled, or the absence of a mini-map or ability to zoom out further.  I do wish the game had a random map generator, as I'm far less interested in the campaign, and more likely to just play it as a Sandbox.  There was a moment in the initial campaign where I started to feel frustrated because it doesn't let you build a tax collector - because it's still in ""tutorial"" mode and doesn't unlock everything at once - and at the same time, some houses refused to upgrade due to ""insufficient entertainment"" despite having jugglers on every block.  I thought it peculiar that you can pick various options for Storage buildings, but none of those options are just ""Store Only This Item"" - so it can be finicky if you want to just have a building devoted to one type of storage from the get go.  No, none of it is game breaking - and I do want to emphasize that.  But there are a few moments where it feels like maybe if the devs play their game from a player perspective, they'll notice some of those small QOL pain points which could stand to be fixed (probably easily) in future patches.  From the dev notes lately, it looks like that is indeed the case.

But the Pros are that this game delivers what it intended.  It's a tribute to the past and if you're reasonably open-minded, you'll find it is a worthy one.  Some reviews are probably too critical and granular in their dissection of the game, because I haven't found any games that don't have at least some points of frustration - and yes, that even includes the ""big"" names like Anno 1800 or Cities: Skylines.

This game is probably not going to be a ""forever game"" that you re-play over and over for the rest of your gaming life.

#1 - The new release just applies updated tech to the core base of the original game in near-entirety, trimming off some of the disliked features from the original in the process, and the price of the new version of the game reflecting that it is primarily a fresher update of the original game 

#2 - The new release uses every trick in the book that comes from modern game trends, places all those under the banner of the title from the original game, and tries to unite the two as best as possible to try to really make the game have a large-scale launch and become a hit. 

This particular game is an example of #1 being applied. 

The game is a remake of the original Pharaoh, to the point that the missions in the first chunk of the game are exactly the same as the missions you go through in the original game. There are not any new buildings added to the game, the resources you deal with are almost entirely the same... AI behavior, the gods you have to worship, festivals... This is a remake of the original pharaoh with updated graphics and all that, for the price of $20 or so which is EXACTLY where it should be. 

Three big changes for those wondering why not just get the original game: 

1) Is that military battles happen completely off the map now. Before in the original battles would go down in the city so you would have to spread your forts around and build walls and consider tower placement to protect your city... Now the armies meet off field (Still a max of 6 forts with 16 soldiers each for a max army size of 96) and the game resolves the battle for you. Some people may be pushed the wrong way about that, I personally don't mind it... THE GOOD NEWS IS that the developer does have a roadmap for the game and one of their priorities is to rework the military system within the game to something more enjoyable that players can participate in, so this aspect of my review may not even apply in a few months. 

2) The menu system has been reworked. To place buildings the menu and sub-menus are on the right side which you can get used to easy enough. To check messages and look at stats and overlays there is a menu on the left side of the map and THAT takes some getting used to. For the overlays that show how much coverage you have of constables and firemen for example, rather then keep checking them I just go off of a rough idea of how many I need in an area, and wait until any messages inform me of whether or not its working or theres problems. That though brings me to the third change which is where I see the most pushback from players:

3) Notifications can pile up on top of one another... Nilometer predictions and Game save notifications will come up as a bar in the screen as you play, but everything outside of that goes straight to an inbox you have to check yourself. If you right click on something in game right as a message appears, you can completely miss it, and it wont be something you can go into your inbox to see again. It hasnt caused me any mission-ending scenarios just yet, but it could definitely be a thorny problem to other players. 

I am a massive fan of the original game, and egyptian shit in general, so these small niggles dont ruin the game for me at all and I am absolutely loving this game. I hope more people buy it and support honest remakes of older PC games, if Sid Meiers Pirates! can get remade then I can die a happy nerd <3",1677881605,1677881605,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played the original game in the last few years for the first time and really enjoyed it. It wasn't that easy for someone who was really new to this game because of the lack of a tutorial. So I was really looking forward to this remake and the QoL improvements.


I've read a lot of the negative reviews, and I feel like a lot of people are complaining about the choices the developers made for this remake. Some are complaining about the new music, the cartoonish graphics, and the UI. I don't mind these things at all. I guess you could do it a bit better, but it's not game-breaking or as terrible as people say. Then there were some game-breaking bugs, but I've never encountered them.

------------------------

Though I love this game deeply and am glad to see it rebooted for the modern era, this is an inexplicably bad remake. While they nailed it in a few areas, there are many janky and outright broken features here.

Some of the issues I have encountered:
- The military battles are completely broken. Soldiers just hit each other forever, and the only way to resolve the battle is to click ""continue.""
- Monument construction seems to work ok functionally, but the animations are all screwed up (artisans disappearing, etc.)
- Merchants always say ""this city won't trade"" even if they have just traded
- Though some aspects of the interface have been modernized, many have not. You still get incessant pop-ups notifying you about blessings, invasions, and other events. There are much more elegant ways to handle this.
- The menus are inexcusably clunky and slow (e.g. when starting a new game)
- The minimap and ability to rotate the camera have been straight-up removed (why??)
- Music consistently won't work on one mission
- There are countless missed opportunities to streamline and modernize the experience. A more informative world map, clearer insight into diplomacy and what the implications of filling/refusing a request might be, better financial information, better trade information (like seeing how much of each good you traded with each city without having to click on each individual city). The list goes on. Heck, many of these were solved by later Impressions games, so you don't have to look far for a solution.

[h1]Does it Run on linux / proton ? [/h1]
Yes, it does. Proton 7.0.6.

[h1] The Story [/h1]
I really enjoy the period of Egypt and immersing myself into this era.
While there are quite a few similar building games out there, 
this one is the remake of the only really good one.

[h1] Worth mentioning [/h1]
The original game which u can get on the other store, where good old games
reside. Has some very unique ways of managing your city. 
Example:
The food distribution depends on the routes the NPC can travel. 
There are too many cross roads, the sole Merchant will not reach enough houses.
Given the many pages and guides that have been written about  ""perfecting your city"" 
and what styles are possible to min max is breathtaking.

[h1] There are bugs ?! [/h1]
Yes, this game might have a few bugs.Personally i did not encounter any of
the ones mentioned from the bad reviews. I only have played for 5 hours.

[h1] Level Design? [/h1]
It contains all of the original levels and DLC where you can play over 
thousand of years and build your family.
This type of gameplay if from a  time when games like Cesar III were hot, which is 
still played by the community and has a lot of open source mods.

Basically you get to live through a time period and accomplish objectives each level.
Unlocking more buildings and adding more to the experience.

[h1] Development [/h1]
Its actively in development and i even talked to the developers at 
an expo. They are working on this and listening to the community, 
its by no means a cash grab. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Its a very challenging and often restarting to get one mission completed. 
Always trying to get your people what they want, while pleasing the gods.
If your in debt twice, thats it. Game Over.

[h1] What would i have put into the game ? [/h1]
Get us a random family name generator or at least put the ones from 
the original back into the game. The UI from the original was simpler 
and more intuitive, also we were able to rotate the camera 45°.",1677709049,1677710065,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think it's a very enjoyable game as it stands; I played through a few of the beginning missions and pretty happy so far. I thought initially the global worker pool was a copout; but really came around to the idea fast; you can eliminate one house slums that you would HAVE to build in the original game; like when your mines are so far from water. It eliminates some quirky development strategies that would just be infuriating.

Besides that, however, the original game does most things better. The UI is fresh; but not necessarily an upgrade over the old one. Some questionable unchangable behavior, wish the buildings were in list menu, I can't find the minimap, just overall a lot of things overdesigned. Not to mention, feels like all the work for the game was done in recreating the original, but the polishes felt thrown together. Not a fan of military in the original game either btw; but the military is really bad; so much that I would rather if it was not part of the game.

Enjoyable game; definitely not sorry that I got the game, but by today's standarts feels unpolished and unfinished. I was there as a community, and they stopped taking much feedback early on. (i don't doubt them, it takes a lot of resources to make feedback during development something positive.) I wish they managed to do an early access with this game; this right now feels like an early access game.

Polish around the UI elements is sorely lacking, and I find the flow very clunky to use. Even after 5 hours of playing, navigating the overlays, accidentally opening the dictionary, even going to the main menu seems very arduous. Some text elements are not aligned and weird placements here and there. Also; I know this is a remake so trying to be as original; but some text has voiceovers, and some does not.

We do need more sim games out there with good flare; and pharaoh is a nice fix without getting very complicated for a city builder, like C:S or things like rimworld. I'm hoping though the game will get polished and not left at this stage.",1677708307,1677708307,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Are you planning to :
-add a minimap,
-add map/view rotation,
-introduce any solutions that will make the game more playable in  line with contemporary standard (like ability to copy storage yards with saved settings, adding the ability to clone settlements or select and move a few objects),
-add information about resorces that are available on the map before the mission starts? 
-fixing the rotation of buildings so that
will result in a different NPC spawn location? Currently we need to remove the road, so the entrance and exit is where it should be.be.
-will there be a visible choice between military and economic missions before starting the mission
Is the game already in final form? If so, there was no point in buying it. Better to play the old version with HD mods...
The game does not work properly, it is much poorer than the previous version. Starting from the fact that it has fewer difficulty levels to the fact that it is impossible to manage the industry properly like the previous version. After locking the computer, the game crashes. It is not possible to change the mission in the campaign once selected without restarting. It is not possible to go back to the previous mission in the campaign. Mission description is visible only after starting the game. Previously, you could at least see if it was a military or economic mission. Automated battles. After firing up the game in the sandbox and making a city with available cheats, I was unable to provide sufficient access to the mortuary despite adding, for example, 3 or 4 working per settlement.  I had all houses evolved and no criminal threats and people were not immigrating to the city through too many slums.... Something is wrong with this game.

Seen some pretty harsh reviews, and many hold merit. Missing Ultra-Wide and map rotation and two big ones for me. I found a mod that fixes Ultra-Wide and devs did acknowledge the issue and planned to add it. Haven't heard anything about rotation which is a bummer. The first hour of playing I ran into an issue where citizens weren't filling job roles and I spent the next half hour pulling my hair out trying to figure out why. Turns out I had a road block hiding behind a temple. Large buildings make map rotation a must to avoid these kind of frustrations.

I find the redesigned UI to be somewhat of a downgrade from the original. Not sure why the devs felt the need to change what already worked. The style doesn't really have that Egyptian feel to it like the original. Hovering over icons presents a pop up showing what the icon is. This is fine but positioning needs adjusting. I can't see the sub icons and I find it really annoying. The pop up notifications are large and very intrusive during game-play. The size needs tweaking and moved some place not in the way. The main menu animations are too slow and imo unnecessary, but once in game, it's a non issue.

Adjustable edge scrolling speed would be a nice quality of life improvement as well. I find the default to be too slow for my taste.

The game could use some slight re-balancing. Haven't been able to put my finger on it exactly, but progression just feels a little off. Maybe it's just me.

Even with these gripes, the game overall is great. I haven't experienced any notable bugs or crashes and just like the original I find myself losing track of time, getting sucked into perfecting my city. I have a love hate relationship with these genre of games. Many I can't stand but some I become addicted too. I was initially worried that this would become and dud compared to the original, but it didn't lose what got me hooked. It's for the most part, still the same game I knew and loved as a child. As long as the devs stick to their word on improving the issues myself and others have brought to light, I fully recommend buying this game.",1677598589,1677598830,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

This game has the balance of hand-holding and leaving you to your own fate as you try your best to steer a fledgling village, town, city, and eventually an entire country towards greatness. At the same time, you have to contend with: 
[olist]
    [*] a pharaoh who doesn't care about your difficulties in getting 1000 beers for whatever he wants over at the capital
    [*] a god (or gods) who feels slighted because you haven't had a feast in their name for the last 30 months    
    [*] the foreign armies who keep coming back for the riches 
    [*] your tired, overworked workers who have eked out a living of the hostile land
    [*] the entire population (what do you mean, I'm a hateful person?! I only raised your taxes to 30%!)

Well, well, what do we have here, an old classic remade for modern times. Lovely idea, and I'm sure the devs had good intentions for their little baby. And at the first glance, I was stunned by the intro video, which was so nicely made. Getting into the actual game then, the goofy walking animations annoyed me a bit, and the lack of a minimap did not make that any better. Ok whatever, maps size were never truly an issue, so no worries. 
Oh, and why would you want to rotate the view? It's a 2d game! This issue pretty much sums up this game: At first glance, everything's wonderful, but don't dare to turn the coin, for you'll notice that homer has not lost any weight, he just wrapped all his body fat back onto his back. 

Yes... what else... 

Apparently, the victory condition trigger is broken. After the first two missions, I had to look up cheat codes in order to trigger victory. On every single one of them. At least until mission 6, at which point I lowered my gaze with the chin raised, staring in disappointment, which slowly turned to utter disgust, like a father looking at his gay son who just added that he was also to submit to the fact that he actually has always felt as a genderfluid and that they would sleep in a bloody jar for the rest of their life. 

On my painful journey to this day, I have also noticed the following:

- Yes, the rumors about the clunky UI are true

- Combat has been reduced to an event window, in which your army faces the enemy. Outside of these events, you have no control over your army, so prepare to fight the other predators with egyptian police batons. I don't remember how they performed in the original, but here they are as effective as those jelly gum dildos

- Construction on monuments freeze for no apparent reason. Warnings about inaccessability appear for no reason. No reason given for why you cannot place monuments at a particular spot (yes, it's 2023 guys, this is mandatory). Workers at times cannot reach the monument. For no apparent reason. First I thought I wasn't allowed to build stuff right next to it. That wasn't it, later I did it again, this time it worked. 

- The gods don't help you with building the monuments, resulting in painfully prolonged missions, in which you just ramp up the speed, make sure to keep the gods at bay, and only wait for your damn slaves to finish that pyramid. 

- Why in the world would you sort save files with the oldest ones first?

- Scrolling speed is sloth level of retardation, no options to change that

- The game suffers from the same issues (and more, see above) as the classic. 

On a plus side: The graphics actually are renewed, you may like the art style or not, but you cannot deny that they have a better resolution than before. And the music got... improved? I don't know, to me it doesn't make much of a difference, but I certainly can appreciate the extra effort they put into it. Then again, they didn't fix the old issues, and managed to add their own to the cake. It's the least they could do.

So to sum this all up, be thy own judge. My advice: Get nebuchadnezzar instead. No goofy animations/ modern minimalistic-inspired artstyle, but interesting takes on fixing the issues which the old pharaoh (and this one ;)) suffered from. It's also not ancient egypt, but mesopotamia, and I haven't played it as thorougly, but my guts are just a lot more relaxed when I play it. When I played this game, I was frequently angry, it almost felt like these times I played COD or battlefield. When you've spent hours building a functioning ecosystem for your city, have 200000 debens and an unemployment rate of 25%, and see your monument barely having completed 10%, there really isn't anything else left to do then to shout at your damn slaves to work faster! 
Even if they fixed all the issues with the game, in my opinion there simply are better games out, or in the making, in order to scratch that pharaoh itch. Perhaps even consider getting the classic. I believe it even includes Cleopatra, and you get it for half the price.

I've played deep into the campaign. Wicked nostalgic if you played the original; and pretty cool city builder even if you did not. I was surprised at the depth - more than I remember, though I might have last played it in my teens (40 now).

Loving it already! As a huge fan of the original I was extremely eager for this remake; but of course nervous too. The game is an excellent homage to the original, and brings back a lot of the memories from 20 years ago. There are a few bugs that can be annoying but are very minor, such as pop-ups hiding other popups. Some of the complaints from others are so overblown that they're just moronic. E.g. no minimap is surprising, and I hope it is introduced soon, but it certainly isn't a deal-breaker. I am confident these bugs and shortcomings will be fixed very shortly. The price is also extremely reasonable, and is actually lower than expected.

Overall, this Remake is quite good. The graphics were improved, bug the once existed are now gone, and even if the military system was almost removed, the threat of beign invaded and raided still exists.

Comparing to the original game, the challenge and fun of building a city is almost identical for me.

The graphical remake is nice (in my opinion at least), it's keep to the original. But there is a lot of clipping issues, especially when building monuments.
I like the music remake, and I like the idea of keeping the OG voice lines. It saves money in voice acting I guess but at least it gives this nostalgia feeling we are looking for with this remake.
I don't hate the UI like a lot of people, I managed to get around it quickly, there could be some user friendliness upgrades but overall I get it, it's very straightforward.

The Bad:
The game is unfinished. There is a problem with saves getting bigger and gobbling RAM on autosave causing freeze for up to 20 sec. 
The minimap is not here. Seriously, who in the dev team thought nobody would complain about the minimap? have you tried huge maps without it ??
There is a try to remake the fight system, and that is a good idea, unfortunately unfinished. towers and walls are useless now, and nothing can kill predators.
And a lot of other small stuff that wil probably be corrected later but that doesn't solve the problem: there is a huge quality control issue here and these things should have.

tl;dr: I wouldn't get the game until at least the main problems and bugs have been fixed. I will stop playing until at least the save bug are corrected. This should have been labelled early access.

Big reason for this was, because it was challenging...
The current state of the game feels a bit dumbed down...

Example:
The old military system was not perfect.. but it added another layer of stress for the player to deal with. They basically gutted the whole system with a pop-up screen... I played the game thinking that this would not bother me... unfortunately I was wrong.

For me, the point of these games were to challenge the player while giving an immersive experience of an ancient city.. They did a good job with the immersive part.. The music is great, the graphics are a nice update as well, but I struggle to find a challenge as I did in the original games.  I also know that they tried to update the game by adding a modern UI and stuff, but sometimes ""less"" is more.

ANE is bringing new bugs that are completely new and sometimes game breaking (monuments stop building, industries stop working, voice over is saturated etc... (see Reddit or official discord for the list)). 
But it has also its minor flaw (glitches, UI bugs, etc... (again see Reddit or Discord for the list))
On top of that, there is a lack of new features, waiting that much time, the community did not ask for a graphic revamp but modern features, ui/ux improvement and bug resolution. Yet, it lacks in new features (like better commerce management, better military, where are all the new assets? ).
I was not expecting that much of a revamped but to see that Triskell did not add anything new or special or unique is the big miss of this release.

I am trully wondering if Activision is cashing out on nostalgia or if Triskell has so much focused on the graphics that they lost sight of the actual modern features we could expect from a city builder.

The original Pharaoh graced our systems last century and was arguably the masterpiece of the Impressions games citybuilding line-up. Given a year to develop it the Impressions team put together a fantastically balanced game with excellent city building mechanics and a monument building system that set a standard that has never been beaten. Pharaoh: A New Era had the roadmap set in front of them and only needed to recreate the game - no map design, building design, balancing, or conceptual creations required. Despite that huge resource they still took years to create this near clone that approximates the original Pharaoh but introduces a number of questionable design choices while adding very few new things, and certainly nothing original from other more modern variants of the citybuilding genre.

Simple coding errors like the Kingdom Road pop-up spam if the kingdom road is missing a single tile, the voiceover of the traders implying they didn't trade anything in the city despite having a full inventory, or the woeful UI layout on the very edges of a mouse-scrollable game and no minimap. Issues abound and trying to play the game is often like fighting the existing UI to get anything done - trade is especially egregious on this front. Speaking of trade, why they made the choice to permit deficit spending but prevent opening of trade routes if you lack even a single deben below the required amount I will never know. But if they DID want to play with the trade system then why didn't they fix the issue with multiple traders not being permitted on the map at the same time? Frankly, they missed a huge opportunity to fix original game limitations and, had they bothered to spend the many years of development time playtesting, perhaps have fixed some of their most obvious bugs before releasing this thing.

My conclusion is that Pharaoh: A New Era is an old take on an old game and fails to live up to the original let alone surpass it. There is very little objective improvement excluding graphics (if you somehow like these new ugly graphics over the more crisp originals) and a few new options to combine a few mechanics from later games in the series that were released 20 years before this version. Recommend against with the caveat that getting the original on GOG or some other platform will still give you access to a fantastic game at a fraction of the price.",1677319566,1677319566,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are a few game mechanics that have not yet been implemented (such as the minimap, military invasions and rotating your camera view to name a few) and as a whole this remake actually has less than the original game. 

I have completed a large portion of the campaign and as of today I can recommend that it's worth purchasing. It still has the original charm of OG Pharaoh and is still very fun to play. Unfortunately I have ran into being hardstuck in an unwinnable mission and am now experiencing the random pausing bug which many others have reported. I expect this to be patched soon.

If you were a fan of the casual and strategic city building aspect of Pharaoh, then you will enjoy this remake. However if you enjoyed the RTS military mini battles, for now it's best to skip.

The game has only been out for a week and I have a lot of faith in the developers listening to feedback from this very passionate community. This has been a great trip down memory lane and I look forward to future updates!

I've played them very recently, and couldn't wait for the remake to see what could be done to revive this game. 

Just to start off, this game does not disappoint if you were a fan of the original city builder game. Everything that you remember and love is there, but now has a nice finish to it. 
If you have the original on Steam, there are a few reasons to purchase the remake, mostly small quality of life improvements and changes to the campaign to make it more beginner friendly. 
Biggest improvement in my opinion is being able to see where entrance/exits are for city officials and services, I don't know how much time I spent trying to get something situated just right to be able to have the architect or water bearer enter on the right street, this makes it easier (although I do wish there was a way to reposition the entrance/exit because it still isn't intuitive in a lot of respects). 
Another big quality of life improvement is global recruiting, a mode that allows the ""No worker lives nearby"" issue to be resolved. I know in this game (and the last) I would have people living across the street from my granary with unemployment and the granary wouldn't be staffed because ""No worker lives nearby"" which made 0 sense. The global recruitment just allows for any worker, no matter where they live to be able to staff a work place. 

Yes - there are improvements to be made like rotation, no minimap, some objections not showing and some glitches that make it so you can't win the condition because you hemorrhage money, but overall it's a great revival of this title and I'm sure all issues will be fixed in the near future.",1677302213,1677302213,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't mind the new art, and I don't even mind the new military system. But there are far too many bugs that have resulted in needing to restart missions.

-Police won't attack predators. If you don't turn them off in the menu animals will eat people with no way to stop them. 
-Firefighters will clear one tile of burning rubble and then despawn. The fire will spread unless you have as many fire stations within reach as rubble tiles. 
-It's possible to soft-lock you out of winning several missions, where you lose trade access to a needed resource  with no way to regain it
-Most monument building animations are missing or broken. The obelisk for example has no visual state other than the initial placement and finished product. No scaffolding or otherwise appear. 
- Trade will randomly bug out, where traders won't drop resources despite being set to import and having an open accepting storage yard
- You will lose trade routes due to low kingdom ratings, despite your rating being quite high. The trigger for these events seem to be if a kingdom rating drops at all. You can boost your rating to 80+, miss a demand to have it drop to 75 and lose a route. You don't gain it back when you raise your rating again. 
- Military abroad assistance will bug out. Sometimes you will send the military assistance and you will get both the victory and failure events at the same time. With the failure event results sticking (such as losing a trade route). 

I've put a bunch of hours into it, and it was good for nostalgia. But I would give it a half year and see if they fix anything. It's gotten to the point I'm working around bugs rather than playing the game.

Those are memories I wouldn't trade for anything. I discovered this remaster was in the works, but like all games, I decided to wait to read reviews after its release to see if it would be a good time to purchase and relive the nostalgia that is Pharaoh. The reviews were worrisome to say the least. It appeared people have been experiencing some bugs and such. But most of the negative reviews seemed to be revolved around people not liking any sort of changes. I decided to take the plunge anyway on a rainy day here with nothing better to do except wanting to relive my Pharaoh days. And so far...

     It has not been disappointing in any way to me. It clearly has heart and a good foundation. The gorgeous, artistic opening video alone was extremely exciting and everything from the menus to the updated sound effects and music, have been very welcomed so far in my book. I believe most of the negative reviews to be from individuals who either don't like or can't accept change. Those with the mentality (if it ain't broke, then why fix it) types. I am not that type of person. This is a re-envision of a classic. And like all re-envisions you need to understand that creative liberties will be taken resulting in a product that is beyond what you are completely familiar with. It is very clear to me that the developers put a lot of heart in this and are still actively developing it....and I LOVE IT! I love that an old game from my childhood was birthed into new life making it a bit more relevant and easily more playable. I love that the art style of this new re-envision excites me in ways making it feel familiar but also totally new. I love the cleaner lines, higher quality visuals and the little added details that bring a new life to it. 
     
     Now as far as bugs, I can't relate yet as I haven't experienced any yet, but I can also see in discussions that the developers ARE LISTENING. They clearly are communicating working on these fixes as priority for them and if you know how these things work, it TAKES TIME to develop and test fixes and updates before they are released to the public. I appreciate them letting us know they are aware and actively working on these issues.

It was among the first computer games I ever played, and I hold much sentimental value to it. However, when I got the game in the 90s, a fair amount of time passed since then, and it became increasingly harder to play on a modern system without heavy use of modding. 
So when I saw this remaster, I was incredibly excited and closely followed the development team's updates. Now that the game is out, I am delighted and disappointed at what is here at launch.
Pharoah is a different kind of city builder, as it is mission-based and almost works like a resource management puzzle. You start with building small villages with huts and grow to sprawling cities building the great pyramids. 
The presentation is excellent. The art updates help significantly to modernize but still respect the original designs of all the buildings, sims, roads, and maps. The music also brought me back to my childhood and immersed me in the experience. One perplexing thing with the audio I picked up is that the original sound assets are reused in some areas. At the start of each mission, there is a briefing done by your advisor and its noticeably tinny and low quality. It would be nice to either; get the voice actor to return or have someone else re-record those lines, so it sounds cleaner. The advisor menus, although perfectly functional, had me missing the original classic menus with statues and hieroglyphs in the background. 
The considerable controversy many people have brought up that I agree with is that the military functions are entirely different. I don't agree with how they are currently handled. I say presently as the developers have said they plan to look at that function in addition to various bug fixes and features. Given that development was during covid, I am optimistic that the dev team will make fixes, but I am thoroughly enjoying this game and am hopeful that this game reaches new audiences that will love this game and series as I have.",1677269305,1677269305,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game lacks some of the charm of the original Pharaoh's UI, but the quality of life changes more than make up for that in my opinion. However, there are some very glaring issues with the game that I feel the devs need to address.

> There are so. many. bugs. I have had issues with trading docks and ferry docks just breaking and becoming unusable. I have had issues with gathering industry buildings not actually gathering anything. Thankfully, these specific issues are mostly solved by deleting and replacing the building. However, I have also encountered dead tiles after deleting said buildings making it unable to replace the building where it originally was.

Not to mention the complete game breaking bugs I've experienced and has forced me to have to completely restart.

Occasionally workers will just stop building monuments for no reason. The game will tell me construction is continuing with no issues, but no progress is made on the monuments completion. Deleting the monument and replacing it doesn't work. Deleting the mason buildings and replacing them doesn't work. Deleting the work camp and replacing it doesn't work. Restarting the game or reloading the save doesn't work. I attempted to find a fix for this for almost an hour before throwing in the towel and restarting the map.

I have also encountered a bug with resources on the map like trees and reeds completely disappearing as if they have all been gathered, and then not growing back. Reloading the game doesn't seem to fix this issue either, and so yet again, I was forced to restart.

> The combat system is a little strange, but I can't say that I dislike the automated battling. My biggest issue is that it seems to have very little impact even upon a loss. I had accidentally forgotten to build up my military during a scenario, and was met with a notification that I would be attacked soon and the opposing nation was ""bent on conquest"". I assumed this meant, upon loss, the campaign would end. Predictably, I lost the battle. The consequence? They pillaged my palace and burned down a few tax collectors and courthouses. Not exactly the kind of conquest I had in mind? I feel like this part of the game has already been stripped down enough. It should absolutely have a bigger impact overall.

***TLDR; The state of the game as it is currently is more than a little broken, and I feel like the only reason I've put up with a lot of these issues so far is nostalgia for the original Pharaoh.

If you're a fan of the original, I would highly recommend picking this up once some of these major issues have been addressed.

I was really looking forward to a remake of the favorite game of my childhood (given the success of other remakes recently), but after playing through first 20 missions I wouldn't recommend buying this to anyone.

This game is full of funny glitches, annoying issues and also bugs that make it unplayable. Other reviews and also the discord for the game are full of examples, but here are some examples:

1) When monuments are being build, most masons glitch out and are not visible on the pyramid, ramps are not aligned, instead of a company of workers pulling a heap of blocks we have one guy pulling one stone block, which looks horrible. I mean, has anyone even tested this before release?
2) Sometimes the buildings just stop working, like woodcutters, monument guilds, etc. One has to delete the building and build it again, or try saving and loading up
3) There are pathfinding issues (woodcutters collect wood from the other corner of the map even though they have a forest just next to them, work camps near flood plains supply my monuments and work camps next to my monuments supply farms on flood plains)
4) Because bazar ladies can now take food from storages as well, there is no need for granaries anymore, but you have to build them because immigration depends on your food reserves, which is computed only using granaries.
5) One hunting lodge can supply a city of 5000 people (and probably more). The similar holds for reed gatherers
6) Saves often grow in size (to hundreds of megabytes), saving takes tens of seconds (autosave cannot be even turned off for that purpose), and sometimes saves become corrupted and unloadable. This is annoying and makes the game basically unplayable.

All these problems will make attempts for bigger and longer missions tough and annoying
What's more, the game simply isn't hard, even the hardest difficulty is easier than the Medium difficulty in the original I would say. Economy system is exploitable, military is easy (two forts of archers were enough for all attacks so far, and I could even defend against war ships with soldiers :D).

There are some good QoL changes, like global labor pool, illustrated building spawn points, and the default ""Accept None"" for Storages, Granaries, and Bazaars. However, for each of the good new thing, there are two things that got worse. Minimap is gone, map cannot be rotated, millitary has been reduced to nothing, UI cannot be hidden and makes it impossible to build around the edges of the map, and I could go on..

The game is simply not finished, which is a pity given the fact that it has already been delayed for two years, and the amount of stuff that needs fixing for the game to even be playable is astounding.

2. Devs promised to implement back minimap.
3. Maybe  quite valuable-   the game itself is bug-free ( again for me!)

Compare to most of the other games I guess P:New Era is worth a positive review.


 My old review and some of the points are relevant today:
yep, it maybe tries to  call your nostalgia, and seems it is BUT

Buggy as hell! 
some core features were removed! WHERE is my MINI-MAP ??

new  UI/UX is really a questionable  decision  maybe the idea is good but implementation raises a lot of questions

I really want to give it a go but am unable for the moment.... FIX it and  I will be glad to change my mind to positive.

  imho: the new graphics on 1080 are a bit blurry for me as I expected a bit crisper image, maybe on 4k it looks better.

The gameplay is very similar to the OG Pharaoh game. Only the UI and Military have changed in significant ways. The New Era copies the missions, maps, and most of the win conditions from the OG. You can literally watch OG playthroughs on YouTube and get how the New Era missions will be set up.
The fact that you can't control the battles is not a problem for me. You still have to prepare for battle as you normally would. You just don't have to manage troop movement around the map. In my mind, this is leaning much more into a City Builder than an RTS like Age of Empires. You build cities in AOE but the focus is on Battles in that game genre..

Atrocious UI aside, the game is a buggy mess. I have had my main campaign save completely corrupt and become unplayable about 1/2 way through (which is pretty far - like 30 hours). There are reproducible bugs with workers not delivering food across water, buildings not receiving correct worker amounts, and the list goes on and on.

Starting with the positive, this game has beautiful graphics and music that was painstakingly re-imagined and made into high quality. I especially enjoy the new soundtrack because of the realistic instruments used and it's a lot less jarring than the original soundtrack and easier on the ears. I could easily play the game for hours with the nice artwork and music.

Unfortunately in it's current state, the game is marred with several bugs, some of which prevent you from winning that particular scenario. E.g., pyramid construction gets stuck and the only solution is the re-build it from scratch.

I will definitely do a another review later on when the game is in more of a playable state.

I get that there are some bad reviews, but a lot of those are about either bugs that the devs are working on or people that may not remember how to play. I will 100% admit -- it's not the easiest game to learn. It's complicated and can be delicate to balance your city.

One of my favorite features has always been that the game teaches you how to play over the course of multiple missions, and in each mission you build a different city. This solves two issues: 
1) you aren't overwhelmed by all the more complicated stuff in the very beginning (taxes, trade, how much people get paid, what percentage of the population should be set aside for each job, etc) so you learn how the game is played over the course of different cities 
2) you don't have to remodel your single city every time you get access to a new building or industry type, or learn about better traffic management. 

The only complaints about this remake that I have is that there are some small bugs (the win condition for the levels don't display properly once you're in the level) and misspellings, and that the options toggles are a bit confusing - I can't tell, but I think you have to select ""unique movement OFF"" to enable it. 

UPDATE:

I'm not sure if I can still recommend it as easily. I try not to be blinded by nostalgia and complain about something just because it's a change, but the returns on playing this over the original are diminishing the more I play. 
Really the biggest upgrade is that you can choose global labor pool instead of having to have a really terrible neighborhood for your miners, which really helps because I always feel bad for those guys. But there are a LOT of bugs, and the farther you get the more game-breaking they are. The AI for which walkers (people who wander the map & essentially deliver services like water, police, religion etc) is bizarre and requires a lot more micromanagement than before. 
The choices for menu UI are bad, but bearable. The combat is not just gone but also broken - blessings from Seth don't actually do anything, so you can still lose guys from battles despite having the blessing that's supposed to protect them. 
I'm disappointed, and since you can still get the original (on GOG, it's broken on Steam) there doesn't seem to be a big benefit to the new version.",1676520792,1677182950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's one of my all time favourite games and I've been looking forward to the remake for ages now, since I heard of its existence. All the screenshots that were shown looked so good, at first sight. When the remake would be released, there would be no way I wouldn't get it immediately. 

I've been playing the game for a few days now and I can't say that I'm not disappointed. There are a few reasons for this:
- The UI is worse compared to the original
   - it's too clunky and vague
   - I miss the original overseer screen
- Mission goals are not as clearly defined as the old ones.
- The Kingdom standing screen is DISGUSTINGLY UGLY. It looks like its made in MS Paint. The original was way, way, way 
     prettier.
- The mini map is gone
- Messages take up way too much screen space
- Placing buildings is just... weird. The position of the mouse and the position of the building you're about to place just not match.
- There is a giant bug present in the game where the price of buildings like roads, houses of beautification that you can ""stretch"" over other buildings or existing roads will calculate money for all tiles that were selected. So if I've placed a bit of road and the new bit of road overlaps with the original one, it will cost money even though that bit of road already existed. This gets extremely annoying when you're placing plazas.
- Sometimes new settlers don't arrive when I've build a second housing block, until I remove everything and replace the housing block.
- Farms need more space, while actually being the same size as the original. You just have less real estate in a floodplain compared to the original.

The opening video looks like its made using Flash and the menu is just ""extra"". Also, where is multiplayer? I'm quite sure that was present in the original. I can't imagine a studio isn't able to fix these bugs and issues and just improve on this mess in no time. Otherwise this game is a terrible cash grab of the worst kind, where the devs have been abusing fans of the original for money. 

Of course not all is bad, the game is beautiful and when you know how to work around the bugs and weird stuff it still is fun. But for a remake I just expected a lot more and a better effort. The original is 24 years old and the only way they improved on the game is upgrading the graphics and the music, but everything else is just a major downgrade.",1677146054,1677146054,False,6,0,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,False

This refurbishing of that old title - despite certain bugs, missing features and military system... - is, generally speaking, a good one. 

I tried to keep my hopes and expectations neutral because with remastered titles there's a lot of risk that it will end up like Warcraft III Refunded.  Happy to say it's not like that in this case.

The game has it's issues - there are some bugs, minimap is missing, popups are awfully constant, military system is... weird and there's no logic to how village folk moves (damn those water suppliers causing my houses to downgrade all the time...) but the spirit of the original has been kept.

I'm mixed about the UI - it's not bad but it's also not excelent. It just is.

So about the pros: 
+ The vibe is the same. I tried playing the old version available on GOG on modern PC and it was a pain. It's good to be able to jump right back to the game I knew and loved.
+ Music - it's definitely not egyptian(but again, we know very little about ancient egyptian music...) but using middle eastern instruments and motifs fits the vibe - despite that handfull of eXpErTs saying otherwise.
+ The Campaign, voice acting etc reflects what was done in the original game.
+ There's a lot of chill in the game (except hippos and crocs killing my farmers...)
+ Overlays are done GOOD. And help a lot

Stuff I've got a mixed feeling about:
+/- Trading system - stuff being taken from a warehouse instead of trading post. Odd, but somewhat makes sense untill You realize you have to put warehouses near a dock if You want to trade by water.
+/- Military system - seems rushed and needs a lot of polish.
+/- Speeding up the game. 1x, 1.5x and 5x speeds doesn't make sense. I mean, I use that quite a lot but I'd appreciate something between 1.5x and 5x.

Cons:
- Lack of minimap. 
- Townfolk could use an upgrade - right now they just walk randomly causing housing to downgrade A LOT.
- Some bugs.
- Requests and invasions dropping right into start of the game - there's no way to fulfill them. 

It's a very decent trip down the nostalgia lane :)

    [*]NO MINIMAP

    [*]Lots of icons instead  of text which all looks same. After 10 hours i had to make keyboard shortcuts.
    [*]Docks dont automatically splits incoming ships
    [*]Gift from gods are too often
    [*]Can't open trade route for barley even though commerce advisor advise it (becam posible after new route opened). Doesnt matter because you dont have brewery building.
    [*]UI often show less information then original version but use 3x bigger screen.
    [*]Had to switch recruitment to global because I could not find where are unemployed citizens. Some overlay could help.
    [*]Combat is not even showing progress of battle. Thats definetly ""alpha"" feature and need more love.
    [*]First pyramid bugged when i start building second one. Then had to delete first and build it again :(

GOOD

    [*]Better adjustment of game speed
    [*]Dock can be set to trade or dont trade each item. Please add also sell/buy option.
    [*]better graphic (even compared to ""hd patch"" fullHD version).
    [*]You still dont know how big army will atack but at least dont have to catch them over whole map.
    [*]Didnt have as big city but expect it to be unlimited in terms of pawns/buildings

Heard this after so long with a rush of nostalgia, but with better visual, fluid control, gameplay and music.
Can't go wrong with this remake when it's only 22 bucks. Support the devs and perhaps we will get remake for other ones too.

Now here comes the bad part of New Era; this will make or break your desire to buy it. While it is $22, I got it from 3rd party site for way less. So while you are not breaking the bank for it, you may be inclined to wait it out for deep sale on this.
Here are the issues that shows what the original and this one have or don't.

1. OG had minimap. This one has NO MINIMAP. NO MAP ROTATION.
2. Scrolling feature is very weak.
3. No shortcuts for basic infrastructures such as road or ""remove"". 
4. OG's OST had that feeling that some Egyptian musicians using just basic instruments to make those amazing music. This one feels like someone had a music editing software to improve the music. It doesn't give you that ""ancient"" vibe. 
5. OG's issues are still present here. While Age simulation, Global Recruitment system and few other game options are nice touch; they fail to remove the internal issues of New Era that OG suffered from. Play and find out!
6. You can't place grass by planting them on areas so that other structures could be placed on top. This is essential for water well but that's not here. You would think there would be a system for that. Just that feature alone would've changed the way you plan for the people.
7. No modding support. Dev stated map editor coming soon.

* The combat was bad in the original game, but now it is inexcusable. Solving a problem by removing the feature entirely is not solving the problem. Now there are parts of the game that still exist but are absolutely meaningless (e.g. walls or troop transports). I guess the fact that you can't protect people from wild animals with policemen anymore is a symptom of the same thing.

* I really like the audio arrangement, and I like the new visuals -- mostly. I'm glad they kept a similar aesthetic to the original. The landscape is beautiful and vibrant, but the people look bad and have awkward animations. They look like the characters in a cheap 2D mobile game.

* There are bugs. Lots of bugs. Graphics glitches, wrong audio, UI elements bugging out, sometimes game-breaking things like traders not trading or inexplicable mass emigration. Not only that, but there are lots of basic mistakes, like spelling and grammar errors in the game text.  

Overall you have to question how much this is a genuine remake, considering how most of the effort appears to just be in the re-skin (graphics and audio). The non-cosmetic differences with the base game are where they've just deleted a mechanic, like combat, but they haven't actually implemented anything in its place -- so you get weird leftover stuff like meaningless defensive structures, or cops who can't fight crocodiles.

So go ahead and play it for the nostalgia factor, sure, if you really want to.

Downgrades:
COMBAT IS IN A POP-OUT MINI ANIMATION THAT AUTOMATICALLY RESOLVES!
This is a major loss of a part of the game. The threat of an invasion was to watch as your army was killed and your physical defences breached as your magistrates tried to intercede. Now an empty rectangle pops up and you watch as two armies stand there and kill each other with no interaction with the environment whatsoever. If you played the combat heavy path in this game, it has been totally ruined for you. 

I found the ""new"" user interface significantly worse with a worse QOL than the original. The Overseers panel requires multiple clicks to open and isn't visually distinct enough from the overlays. It's harder to tell what you are trying to build. 

Pre-mission animations are simply missing. Presumably they didn't want to actually bother with turning them into 4k animations so just cut them instead.

As others have said, magistrates don't fight animals which means your people just stand there being mauled by crocodiles while no one does anything about it. 

None of the improvements you should expect from this update exist, unless you were the one person hoping for more cloud shadow animations. Visually the game is not meaningfully improved. There is no minimap or map rotation to view from other directions.

The only improvement I think I've found is the system for equipping additional weapons, shields etc to your forts - not that it will matter to you whether they make use of them in the auto-resolved combat. 

It's also buggy.
As soon as a single house reaches a high crime risk, the notifications of palace robberies become so frequent it is a struggle to place a new magistrates office (now inaccurately called a police station). You just can't get the clicks in. I'm also experiencing bugs with fishing wharfs so severe that it is hard to keep people fed when there are a main food resource. 

Go back to the old version. It's a total waste.

It's a bit difficult to cipher through some of the negative reviews. There are plenty of real issues with this remake.

However, issues like, ""invisible animals keep me from placing buildings"" are very likely the spawn points of those animals, which - like in the original - were invisible and kept you from placing buildings... The ferry's and docks not working are, honestly, rather faithful to the original but can be overcome. 

With ferry's, certain industries like reed-gatherers wont use them if they have to cross flood-plains or other weird criteria. This, though, was part of the odd charm of the original. You have to be willing to learn the nuances of Destination versus Random walkers (some cross ferrys, some dont, some have long paths, others dont, etc.). 

The lack of rotation is odd, but the F button flattens all buildings so you can place things - to my knowledge, you'd only rotate the map to place a small building (like a firehouse) behind a tall one (a temple). The F button solves this.

The 'Chief Advisor' gives the (so-called) erroneous information of ""high taxes"" or things of that nature. IIRC, this is somewhat similar to the original. It doesn't SEEM like taxes are high at 3%. but if city sentiment is low, this is an issue. Additionally, you really shouldn't rely on taxes until you are on the last 3-5 tiers of housing when the inhabitants become scribes (drop out of the labor pool) and the house evolves into a 3x3 or 4x4 palatial estate.  As an example, a fully populated Fancy Residence (the top-tier 2x2 residence) provides 220 Deben/year on Normal difficulty. A fully populated Spacious Manner (bottom-tier 3x3) provides 600 Deben/year! A fully populated Palatial Estate (Top tier housing, 4x4) provides 1920 Deben/year... Remember, these inhabitants drop out of the work force, though. Essentially, don't rely on taxes early - look at the trade map and prioritize getting an exportable industry up and running asap. 

Throwing humility out the window, I played the original for, if I had to guess, thousands of hours as a kid, and even some as an adult. In my modest play-time with the New Era version, I've yet to find a single game breaking bug. Sure, I messed up and built a massive city then couldn't place a monument properly. A modern game may help you avoid those issues, but this isn't a modern game.



It's old, but look at Pharaoh Haven's website for some great info (and a kick of nostalgia).



The UI is a real issue. It blows. Very disappointing but not enough to make me stop playing or regret my purchase. The lack of, or change to, tooltips is also an issue - especially with monuments (hint: place monuments FIRST, they cost nothing to place and you can plan around them easier).

The amount of center-screen pop-ups - pausing the game or not - is faithful to the original, but is even more insufferable now. Very sad the developers didn't fix this. 

And this one may just be personal, but I'm frustrated to see that throwing festivals for Gods is still a multi-click action requiring constant maintenance. 



Overall, I'd think this game would be unplayable for someone who never played the original. There's just too few QoL updates to make it feel good.

If, however, you loved the original will all it's silly and weird quirks, you will enjoy this version immensely

The devs really did a beautiful job with the artworks and new music, the entirety of the remaster is so true to the original game that I constantly feel nostalgic and familiar at every turn. The new UI certainly takes some getting used to but it was clearly designed with intent, the new placement and categories are all logical; veterans be warned you will need to retrain your muscle memory!

The tutorial really surprised me with how much more indepth it is for newer players, while also pointing out key differences between the original and the remaster for veterans to get acquainted with. This remaster truly feels like a labour of love and I'm so happy the Devs chose to embrace what made Pharaoh beloved, instead of just """"""improving"""""" it.

Some key differences to keep an eye out for is the ability to rotate ALL buildings (which is nice for temples), new artworks and variety for beautification, and POINT AND CLICK COMBAT REMOVED ENTIRELY, it's now just a skippable simulation.

I finished the campaign, but I ran into a massive amount of bugs every other mission. Docks would stop working with 10+ ships backing up. Trade routes would close, and never reopen even after letting it run for 30+ years. Monuments would stop construction lacking materials (lamps im talking to you) with a stockpile next to them for years, deleted the monument and rebuilt and had no issues till the next mission. The worst is the amount of popups, the game becomes a right click simulator with 20 popups every minute.(sometimes more with 4 gods)

I changed from a thumbs up to down for the following reason:
When i ran into game ending bugs (1 every 2 missions) I met everything I could and used the cheat ""Pharaohs Tomb"". This reduced the frustration and made the game fun. But if i have to cheat to even progress in the game, its a thumbs down. Not to mention yesterday every save got corrupted, and i had to follow a guide on the discussion board to delete ALL saved games and data. Then it worked.

Edit 2/18: Just did 2 combat missions, and they drastically changed how combat worked. Its now more of an auto battler as opposed to invasions, or using your forces strategically. Definitely makes it more of a 'relaxing' game, but i preferred the old way. Still a great recommend for the game though.

A very faithful recreation of one of the best city builders of the 90's. Just hearing about invisible ostriches in the sand brings back memories. If it has the same amount of missions and side paths, it has around 20-30 hours of campaign mode, and then quite a few in custom modes to build the monuments.

Voice acting seems new and updated, but the music definitely sounds different. Not in a bad way though.

The UI is way better, as well as having addtl options for a few quality of life issues the first game had.

@@@Editing this as I go. Not changing my recommendation but I will if this goes like that.

Cons first:
- UI need massive rework. And No MiniMap ? No minimap in a city-builder game ? I cannot find the rotate camera button( I am not even sure it exists)
Even the styling of button placements is out of Pharaoh atmosphere, it stands out a lot which is bad. What is the drop down menu and its striped background for, a futuristic style in prehistoric game? Some options have popup tooltips some does not. Notification system is worse than original, it was annoying for regular things before, now it is both annoying and in addition to that useless when you need them. And notification stacking?(Really?) What is the X sign instead of a shovel, man even a dynamite would blend better than it. No mini map(!), this does not need any further comment i think. 

- I can understand the overlay usage you are trying to implement, it need time to get used to, but it shouldn't need any more button click to close it, right click maybe ?

- I can get the cartoonish look, but I cannot hold myself from saying it is too much. Especially when the screen is filled with colorful objects and with this much cartoonization it looks like more of a disco than prehistoric Egypt.

- Flooding of nile was better looking in the version which was ~20 years ago... I mean, come on....

- Music is nicely replaced but some tracks stand out, I dont know the exact problem but it can be normalization or high treble problem.

- Going to fullscreen mode sometimes end up creating a black stripe under the screen, which is not usable or goes back to displaying something in game. Also menu sizes changes abruptly when you confirm a resolution change.  This could be due to W11 or the screen ratio I'm currently using. (1920*1200)

- In some places (like where flood and soil meets) road placement is shown but not applied when you actually try to build it.

- Some things on info screens (of buildings) are better and more useful, but it doesnt need so much space...

- Does game speed buttons supposed to work like this. 5x to 1.5x when you click the lowest one, which if you click again takes it back to 1x then click again 0.5x. Maybe it can be more understandable if it was faster or slower buttons like left and right arrow shapes. 1 less button, but more intuitive.

- Pre-game objectives screen could be a lot better. I mean A LOT. Why two column type? It was better than this before, even with less pictures. 

- I may have encountered some problems in my graphics or some entities in game tend to draw in background of other objects when they need to be on top. I encountered a hippo and some walkers going in and out with terrain. 

 - The stitches/crosses/lines next to water sources and city icons in map screen glitches sometimes when moving and zooming on map (campaign selection screen).

- Cant we just build on trees as an improvement? 

-Police cannot kill critters like hippos and crocs... So game basically forces you to disable them.

-Off-road pathfinding(for get all - get X/Y) is worse then original, cart pushers try to get on the closest road line and follow it until the nearest point they are going to get their things from.

-Stone masons are not visible above the first level, if you did not see them going in you may not know they are there. 

-Stone pullers for pyramids needs road connection, storage yard to pyramid? Or is it another bug I encountered.

-Shipwright and Carpenters’ Guild tends to bug and do not work wasting the resources they get, you have to delete and rebuild...

-Why need transport ships if you battle in another mode. I am not telling the new battle mode is bad but it should be optional like global worker pool.

-All Construction Guilds tend to bug and not work. Delete and rebuild.
 
-Get X/Y for storage yard and granaries tend to bug, cart pusher gets the thing but cannot drop if the percentage is filled. But even after it gets emptied cart pusher may still stand there and does nothing, need to delete and build again to fix...

- If you have two docks with same trade properties, every ship that trades those things goes and queues in the 2nd dock(furthest from input point) leaving first dock to functionless.

-Culture rating reports back wrong (mostly), better read the entertainment advisor...

-You cannot build road over irrigation ditch. You have to build road first then the ditch................................

-Buildable and non-buildable flood tiles does not differ too much in graphics for me(personal opinion).

-Toggling industries on and off mostly does not do anything... They still consume workers and interestingly when you toggle again it may work...

-When the above toggling works, employment still counts all...



Pros:
+ Acceptable remake
I am sure it will be better with fixes (I am hoping a lot of fixes)

+ Global Worker Pool  (Optional)
Hurray, it is like Zeus.  

+General pathfinding is better.

+ Off-road X
Nice addition

+ Most of the musics are nicely replaced.

+ Aside from some little this and that, main graphics keeps the prehistoric Egypt atmosphere in game. Please do not go that deep into the cartoonization bandwagon. No, shiny, golden looking, bricks(!) when building mastaba  please....

And lastly,
I wish something else in the game. 

*** Can you just let us create a template which we can place in game like a regular building.... So we can build and share our housing blocks maybe?

So it’s only natural that I got super excited when I heard about the remake. The provided demo was a huge let-down, though – mainly due to the cartoony graphics.
Then I got a huge nostalgia hype before the main release so I bought it with low expectations, and I must say that after 10 hours I got used to the graphics, even though it still looks like a mobile game.

What I didn’t get used to after my 10-hour playtime is the interface – its unintuitive icons make little sense, and they are super-small on a 2K monitor. Why they didn’t use the old interface? The Egyptian hieroglyphs were more understandable that the nit-sized pictures the devs have chosen. I loved screening my city with various overlays in the original game, but now I am afraid to open the dropdown menu and look for a hazard… And where is the minimap?

Another let-down is the military aspect: you get a pop-up window and a goofy animation with the outcome – based on how many soldiers you have against the enemy. The OG had an RTS mechanic in which you could send your companies wherever you wanted (even though it was not a real-time strategy and it wasn't done very well).

What’s good about this game is my feeling that they somehow improved walker mechanics, as if the pathfinding of distribution and services were smoother (but this might be highly subjective). The global worker pool is a nice touch.

Shame they couldn’t use the original music, but they tried to recreate it.

To sum up all the bad and good, I would recommend the game, most things are OK to live with... the worst thing is certainly the UI and overlays, but they are probably digestible.....

 BUT the current state of the game with its many bugs prevents me to give it a thumbs up (just have a look at the discussions tab).

+ attempt at recreating the game
+ QoL improvements that plagued the Impressions games
- disappointing, cartoony graphics
- terribly unintuitive user interface and overlays
- missing minimap
- no military control
- gameplay bugs
- some achievements are bugged

Prior to this roadblock I was already getting a bit soured on the experience for a number of reasons, but I really really wanted this to be good. There is stuff to like here so I'll start with my positives:
[list]
[*] It's Pharaoh. I'm playing Pharaoh again!! This game rules!!
[*] I seem to be in the minority here, but I'm really glad they did away with the military unit control. This is a city builder, not an RTS, and that system always felt tacked on to appease some shareholder. The system they replaced it with seems a bit [i]too[/i] dumbed down (there are hints in some menus that it gets more complicated later, but those mechanics haven't shown up by Abjedu), but ultimately I don't miss it (except for the oversight that hippos and crocs are still in the game and can slaughter your people indiscriminately lol)
[*] The overworld and building graphics are absolutely beautiful. I love watching the inundation take over my farms. While the UI is overall terrible (see below) there is some genuinely lovely stuff, for instance the hieroglyphic citizen portraits.
[*] The redone music is really good. I wish there were some sort of classic mode so I could appreciate both versions but I can imagine there might be licencing issues there.
[*] Quality of life stuff that's going to make it tough to play the original again. The ability to change the settings from recruiters to global worker pool make the game SIGNIFICANTLY easier, but also just a lot more fun. There's a reason Caesar 3 did it this way. Stuff like copy-and-paste, zooming, a bit more transparency about game mechanics, all great.

Unfortunately, the cons are too many and too in-your-face to ignore. I suspect almost every problem I have with the game is due to needing to rush it out; any one of these things would be baffling as a conscious design choice.
[list]
[*] The beautiful landscapes and buildings are really marred by the character designs. I want to say they feel very mobile game, but honestly they feel ripped straight out of a mid-aughts flash game.
[*] The UI is just terrible. This was supposed to be one of the major improvements over the original! Back in the day, the UI was certainly a bit clunky but it wasn't confusing to navigate, and it had [i]soul[/i]. The soul is completely sucked out of this modern iteration in favour of usability, except the usability is completely gone too. There is no mini-map anymore (?????). The distinct hieroglyphic pictograms used in the original are replaced with either flat, cartoony graphics that all look too similar (every building has it's own now, instead of simply just categories) or bland corporate icons (a question mark. a globe. a histogram.) I don't know how to explain this, but everything feels to be in the wrong place. After 5 hours I still find myself clicking on the wrong thing for nearly every action, both out of confusion and because of a placement that just feels [i]off[/i]. The world map is a particularly bad example of all these issues. The cold, sterile, zoomed out map of the eastern Mediterranean does no justice to the scale of the world. Cities crowd together and overlap on the map, making most labels unreadable even when you have the city highlighted. It just feels sad.
[*] Outside of the gamebreaking bugs, there's lots of minor-to-moderate glitchyness that gets in the way. Wildlife stutters across the world. The Overseer of the Workers will periodically tell me I have zero workers anywhere until I close and re-open the menu. Trade ships will line up six deep at a dock instead of going to a free one, and when they finally sail away, holds full of papyrus, the captain will grumble about how this city never trades. 
[*] The above two points lead to a truly frustrating ux, but other things contribute as well. There is no sound effect for any mouse action either in game or in menus, which feels pretty disconcerting. You can pan the map only horizontally or vertically, staying stagnant if you move your mouse to the corner. The way road placement works when dragging a stretch is janky and random, much less intuitive than the original.

I really want to be able to recommend this game. The good that is contained herein clearly points to passionate devs who love Pharaoh as much as I do. The strange way it was released (almost complete radio silence for several months, ended by an abrupt ""out in two weeks!"" post) is almost certainly the fault of some higher-up moneyman. This game needs several more months in the oven, and I desperately hope it gets some serious patches in the next few weeks.

Like everyone says, it's a huge nostalgia moment for me as I still play the original Pharaoh (with the cd's and the thick manual they came with). 
First off the pros: 
-Its a Pharaoh game
-The GUI is updated and everything looks much nicer. 
-Pathfinding seems little better as wondering workers tend to wonder towards the areas they have avoided and not truly random like the original was. 
-Options for labor to be tied by road and proximity or have global labor where as long as you have unemployed people and your industry is connected to road, it will get workers. 

Cons: 
-The UI is gigantic and is not resizeble at the time this is written. This is especially problematic with edges of map and 20000 notification pop ups you get if you play on the x5 speed. 
-Objectives a little vague at times that forces you to remember that if you have no more objectives, you have to refer back to the beginning screen to see what the win objectives were which is not really a con, but more QoL annoyance. 
-Individual building labor stats were intuitive and weren't shown as a number, but rather an icon now of 6 figures that act as a fractional visual aid. You have to mouse over to find the actual number which took much, much longer to find than I care to admit.
-The scroll speed is slow, you cant change it
-There is no minimap should you grow tired of the scroll speed. 
-You also cant rotate the screen at all which is, again more annoying when dealing with edge of map areas.
-There are bugs, especially with campaign, but this is a minor inconvenience. (When accessing world map for the first time press the map button in-game. Keyboard press does not set off the campaign progression)
-Limit on military building. you can build max of 6 total. 
-You cant interact with the wildlife with the military anymore. You can turn it off in the menu, or leave it be and let it kill your citizens, military doesnt work so no point of having it. 

Edit: Biggest con for the title is the military 
Wall no longer do anything since military conflicts happen as an autoresolve on a popup screen where the guy with the biggest number wins. Likewise with the naval part of the combat. 
This would be fine if there was tactics and walls incorporated into the pop-up screen. You could include formations and turn based combat if that's easier for you to program and if the player loses, destroy buildings and take x amount of gold per soldier left alive in the enemy army. But as it stands, military combat was reduced to nothing. 
Walls and gates are decorative, wildlife are untouchable and Seth doesnt actually kill invading armies like he says he does (possible bug). Really you could have just updated the GUI on the old title and released it as a master and I would have bought that in a heartbeat.",1676945907,1676946632,True,4,2,0.502702295780181885,0,True,False,False

Yes, there is some fun to had, hence the 25 hour playtime at time of writing.
This wasn't exactly my choice though. There are multiple problems with this game, problems you shouldn't be expecting in a remake of a 20 year old game. Therefore I applied for a refund after playing just a couple of hours but was denied, so I gave it another shot.
Various statistics from the overseer should give you information about your city so you can plan accordingly. These graphs aren't labeled though so any would be informative statistics are incomprehensible. 
There are dangerous animals wich roam the map on cetain missions. You can have all the policemen and military you want, but these will do nothing to stop crocodiles ans others deciating your population and produce.
There is no way to turn the map to look behind tall buildings. If you hover over a building it becomes momentarily seethrough but it would be so much more convenient to just be able to turn the map. A feature that apparantly was possible in the original game.
Besides all this, the game was still enjoyable. However, I'm currently on the mission where you build your first piramid.

First thing - thanks for bringing me access to one of my favorite childhood games. No copies I ever bought digitally in the modern era worked on my PCs, but this one does to where it is easy for me to sink hours in like I used to. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

My thesis statement for my review is: this is a fantastic remake in that I absolutely feel the nostalgia, and y'all have upgraded a cozy space into a cozier one, but that's as far as it goes.

This is all fine for me because all I ever wanted for my life was a playable copy. However, I do agree with some of the comments on the steam page, that maybe it was *too much* of a remake, ya know, and by that I mean, some older issues still come up. Funnily enough, I got a huge hit of nostalgia from one of my storage yards burning to the ground and leaving rubble that I couldn't pick up with my destroy button. And I could still build on top of it, just like when I was a kid <3 I mean that with love. I personally don't mind a cosmetically upgraded and playable game, but I see what other reviews mean when they want less bugs and more quality of life upgrades. I haven't had any game-breaking bugs happen yet, but I've at least seen ones that are familiar to me, so I'm curious about how much back-end updating went into the gameplay mechanics. 

I honestly really struggle with the UI - it's really hard for me to find anything. I honestly don't remember the UI from back in the day, but I struggle with understanding what things are with this UI. The best I can describe it is that my brain has a hard time understanding what icons are which. l wish the icons themselves had words on them, so I'm not hovering over every icon to find out what it does. This feels especially prominent when I'm looking for the right overseer to talk to. 

Not sure how to effectively deal with predators, I turned them off. 

I think it's cute that the game kept old audio files and voice lines. That stuff was a very ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" sort of thing, and I get nostalgia bombs from hearing the bazaar lady's cheery lines. 

The game needs some work before I can call it a great upgrade, but I am deeply happy that I have spent 20+ hours reliving my childhood for the past week. 

For consumers: buy it if you miss Pharaoh dearly and are unable to make the older version work on your new PC, but don't expect any mind-blowing changes.

Also very annoying when villager houses flicker between levels.

Military aspect is also very underwhelming - why display health bars when the animation is just going to be two armies walking towards each other with no fighting or damage?

Would suggest some QoL changes, such as adding area of effect radii on work buildings to see if villagers are in range, or ability to accelerate monument construction with extra resources. Or sorting the Chief Overseer to the top of the list of overseers instead of somewhere in the middle?

A remake or remaster should aim to surpass the original in one way or another and Pharaoh a new Era fails to do so. The graphic overhaul is nice but overall what we have is a remaster that is inferior than the original in numerous ways. 

-A lot of the economy is broken 
-The menus feel worse to navigate
-You cant rotate the map (which has me suspect they half assed the graphical overhaul.)
-They completely remade the battles into this weird passive auto battle screen where the soldiers literally don't do anything which also makes me suggest this game is unfinished. 
-Because they got rid of actual armies you village is now susceptible to wildlife so enjoy gators ransacking your village and messing up your economy. Also because no units can do battle even your police force cant stop wildlife either.

Some major things I dislike from this version:
1. The reworked combat/battle feels lazy and rushed. There's no way to clear the map from wild beast as your constable also ignores the beasts. This is a major letdown for me.
2. The reworked combat led city fortification to be obsolete. What's the point of making walls and gates when the enemies never actually set foot in your city?
3. The monuments sometimes bugged, from harmless misplaced animation to critical bug where I need to rebuild it from scratch on the exact same position due to the pathing issue that made progress impossible.
4. Overseer looks and feels worse compared to original version.
5. UI design looks cheap compared to the more ""authentic"" original version.

The initial feel is very good, I liked the direction of the more cartoony animation which feels faithful to the original as well as the music. But the rework to battle and some critical bug is the main reason why I thumbed this down.

The updated music is wonderful, and I'm glad the voices are the same- cuz I've had the homeless people complaining sound bite stuck in my head for the past 15+ years. Global labour pool is a life saver and I love that addition. Difficulty feels much more accessible because of it. Also, delivery men who don't have anywhere to put food still stand in front of the farm, but now they don't die when the flood comes in. Hell yes. This version is so much more accessible and user friendly than the original. The graphics are so cute (sometimes I miss the kind of scary looking 2000s graphics, though). There are some bugs that I'll mention, with hopes of it being the fact that they'll be patched out later (nothing game breaking)
-While I love the fact that battles are a mini cutscene now, nothing seems to happen in said cutscene. The soldiers just kinda run into each other indefinitely until you hit continue. There seems to be a health bar at the top, which makes me think you're supposed to be able to watch them actually kill each other, but for now nothing happens and you just have to hit continue. Also, the inclusion of this cutscene thing kind of defeats the purpose of walls and other defensive buildings, but I'm not sure if they are supposed to do something in the cutscene.
-In the old version, when you had more than one dock, the trade ships would go to the dock with the lowest queue/closest to them to make trading go quicker, but in this version they just go to whichever dock is the closest. Sometimes I have 4 or 5 ships waiting at one dock while the other dock is completely empty.
-Sometimes firemen get stuck in the putting out fires animation.
-You can't build irrigation ditches under roads, you can only build roads over irrigation ditches.
-There are some levels where some goods just won't be exported/imported, even if I've set them to be. With the imports, usually if I set it to ""import to maintain X"" that will fix the issue, but with exports I'm just kind of out of luck. For example, even though I had limestone set to ""exporting surplus"" while playing the North Darshur level, but nobody ever bought limestone from me, even with multiple storage yards full of limestone right next to the dock. They would buy other things from me, like beer and pottery, but not limestone. Not sure if this is caused by the fact that that level also has a pyramid that you need limestone for. Also, it takes forever for a resource to start being imported/exported once I turn on trading for that resource, way longer than the original. It stops immediately when I turn off trading, though.

Like so many others here, I was an old player of the original Pharaoh and stopped playing it when I couldn't make my CD work on the very latest versions of Windows.

All in all, they did a good job : they managed to keep the feeling of the old game while adding a few new things that feel nice. You liked playing the old version ? You'll like this one : the graphisms are closed to the original while having been polished. The music feel perfectly right. The campaign doesn't feel different, you'll still be playing it for hours.

Yet, there are a few drawbacks that I'd like to see changed, like many others before me have pointed out :
- the major change is war : you just can't chose to move your army anymore, you just get a (loosy) video instead. I'd love for the dev to (at least) give us the choice to fight our battles. I haven't been to the point of building ramparts, but I can't see no reason to build them due to these changes
- you can't rotate the map. And as the building don't vanish when you hover over them, you can't see what's behind
- the gods are easy to pleased (like before) and you've got pop-up constantly interrupting your game to say so.
- there are minor bugs due to translation in the french version, like untranslated stuff or the fact that when you accept less than a full storage of a good, it displays an ugly ""accepted - the whole date and hour "" instead of just ""accepted""
- you can't choose the speed at which you scroll the map. As they didn't implment the mini-map, I'd like to be able to scroll a little faster to the other end of the biggest maps.
- I did encounter a few little bugs : a monument started right next to another couldn't be finished while the first one was (and still having access to the road) ; while having more than one dock all boats go to the same and totally ignore the other docks.

All in all, I'd still say go for it if you loved the original game. Don't expect a radical change, expect the game to be in their early version and have fun like before !

There is no true sandbox mode and you are always locked to a set of predefined monuments and win conditions.

I had noticed that starting dates in the game are listed as negative values and lacked the standard notation of AD/BC or CE/BCE. (a date range for a mission being -3000 -2460 as an example while using the BC/AD model elsewhere in the game.)  The devs have since closed that discussion flagging it as ""not constructive"" and locked the thread.

I grew up playing the original when it was released and the wonder inspired by that game went on to heavily influenced my course work in college, pushing me into more and more history classes.  I have never encountered anyone, anywhere that records dates as a negative value.  Pharaoh actually set me on the path to learn that.

But it is inconsistent based on what ""techs"" you have available in mission... You still have to click several times to get anywhere in UI, you just click on icons instead of texts. DEVs, have a look at recent ANNO games or ""Endless ..."" series to see how UI is done. This is just pathetic attempt to be different from original game. EDIT: the missing minimap is a delightful bonus to the botched UI.

3.) Many bugs, from visual bugs when building monuments (fine, even if original didn't have as many of them) but also bugs related to the engine - monument building stops sometimes for no reason, it's a great pain to be selling the same goods as was requested by another city, sometimes ferrys don't work and you have to rebuild them for no reason... bugs everywhere

You cannot control the troops from a fort until enemies attack, and then they get sent off to combat and you cannot control them there. the little cutscene that plays has nothing dying, ever, and is best just skipped.

Then there are the other, minor things. Selecting any citizen in ceasar III or pharoah original would give you a variety of well voiced lines that help you get a feel for your city. In pharoah, every citizen of every different type will always give you the same line, every time. Just lazy.

I love Pharoah.  It is basically the only game I play.  Every couple of years I'll get the itch, and spent a week or two playing, until I've worked through the whole game (and the Cleopatra expansion)

So, obviously, I was excited for the re-skin!

Overall it is good.  A few small weird things here and there that end up getting resolved by restarting the game, or deleting a building and rebuilding it.  Small things.  One of my docks was made unususable because of a ""ghost ship,"" it was at the port that only sold limestone.  It put in an order of limestone... and then sat there forever.  Nobody else could use the dock.  Eventually I deleted the dock, re-built it one square over, and things started working again... with the ghost ship just hanging out, until the level completed.

Just.  Weird things like that.  Annoying.  But tolerable.

Until Rostja.

Regularly building on my pyramids would just stop, because even though nothing had changed, even though my stonemasons guilds were completely staffed, they just... stopped going.  I was able to fix it temporarily by deleting the guilds, re-building them in a different spot, or re-starting the game.  But it would happen again!

UNTIL... I saved the game, over-writing the most recent autosave, exited, then came back and tried to enter campaign mode... and got a ""something's wrong with the save file!"" message.  Ok, ok, no need to panic, I'll just pick a different Rostja save file manually.  Went to the previous save file.  Same message.  For that, and all others.

WHAT HAPPENED TO MY AUTOSAVE.  WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAMPAIGN.  I have no idea why or how, but apparently my game is just corrupted now?  Why?  What happened?  

Oh, and to top it all off, I think I was going to have to delete and re-start my smaller pyramid, because it seems that if it's tall enough to go off the page, the game does not want to actually complete the pyramid?  That is my guess, anyway, and it is unrelated to the other build-stop-errors I mentioned earlier (where the pyramid was each time perfectly fitting all on screen)

So.  Can't recommend right now.  I hope the developers address the bugs that exist which, unfortunately, make the game unplayable.  Something you couldn't do back in 1999, where if the discs were borked, your game was borked.  Now, thanks to the power of the information superhighway, devs can put out broken builds, and let us do the testing :)

Developers, if you read this, feel free to get in contact with me, I'm happy to try to help identify bugs more precisely, if you tell me how.

CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL
-----------------------------------

Also, because I have seen lists of changes, and thought, ""wait, this didn't include X...,"" here's a more comprehensive (but surely incomplete) list of changes, as I remember it.  My memory may be wrong, feel free to comment if I'm incorrect on anything

- [b]MAJOR: why is no one talking about this?  Houses no longer ""consume"" beer/pottery/linen/etc[/b]
(houses now have consumable goods, food, and ""house"" level goods, beer/pottery/linen/luxury.  Once a house has pottery, it has pottery, you don't need to provide it again.  If the house downgrades for some reason, perhaps your temple collapses? I don't know if it ""loses"" its higher-evolved-level goods and will need them again as it evolves, or if it keeps them.  THIS MAJORLY CHANGES THE DYNAMIC OF THE GAME)

- [b]Game does not pause while scrolling [/b]
(previously, putting your cursor at the edge of the map paused the game)

- [b]Monuments must connect to the kingdom road [/b]
(no more plopping a pyramid in the middle of a desert. You must link it to a road.  THIS HAS BUGS.  Sometimes, despite having the road fine and connected, work will not start because they for some reason believe the road isn't there.  Deleting the monument and placing it in the exact spot again works to fix this.)

- [b]Police, magistrates no longer kill dangerous animals[/b]
(no more having a police-riddled slum near rocks, to fight off the scorpions)

- [b]There's no point in having an item available for trade at multiple docks[/b]
(If Dock 1 trades in Pottery, ALL boats who trade in pottery will stop there for pottery, and nowhere else.  If you have a storage yard for pottery at a later dock, don't bother, nobody will buy pottery there, they did all their trading for it at the first dock.  I actually like this change, it makes managing imports/exports easier.  Yes, ships will stop at multiple docks.  If Dock 1 has Pottery trading On, Beer trading Off, and Dock 2 has Pottery and Beer both On, a ship which purchases both will buy pottery from Dock 1, Beer from Dock 2)

- [b]You can see the points in ingress/egress from a building, both when building and later[/b]
(this is nice!)

- [b]Flood plains are spec'd different?[/b]
(the edges I swear are off.  Spots that look like should fit a farm, do not; the edges are 1-square more sensitive.  You can fit fewer farms into the flood plain)

- [b]You can no longer see what Bazaar workers are carrying[/b]
(in the original game, you could click the workers as they returned to the bazaar, to see what goods they had purchased.  You can still click them, but it won't show what they are carrying)

- [b]Some kind of upgrade to soldier's equipment?[/b]
(the forts mention being able to fashion compound bows from wood for the archers, and shields from antalope hides for the infantry.  My game broke before this ever became workable gameplay for me)

- [b]Ptah respects your ""fill up to X% of yard""[/b]
(this may have existed in the original?  If you have a yard that is 1/4 pottery, with rules saying ""allow up to 1/4 pottery,"" and is otherwise empty, and Ptah selects it for the ""fill a storage yard with excess capacity"" blessing?  You get no additional pottery, it remains 1/4 filled.

- [b]You can no longer partially fulfill burial provisions[/b]
(let's say a pyramid needed 800 pieces of wood.  Preciously you could do this in batches, a few pieces at a time.  Now fulfilling burial provisions is all or nothing)

- [b]There is no longer a general ""Risks"" overlay[/b]
(only specific overlays)

- [b]No ""randomly generate an egyption name"" option when creating your family line[/b]

- [b]No videos in between dynastic stages[/b]
(it's all just one long game of lots of many games; I liked the way that divided the eras)


- The changes to war
(others have commented on this, so I won't bother.  I cannot tell if Transport warfs are still necessary, because my game BROKE.  They were not necessary on the levels I played)

- The changes to the interface
(again, other people have commented on this)

But this game has dumbed down core features, has bugs, and still has some easily fixable issues that were there in the original

Some issues:
- You can't rotate the map to see buildings that are obstructed (come on... even the original had this), and the minimap is gone too (although not a major issue)
- Military combat is massively dumbed down. You don't direct your troops anymore - instead, battles are played out on a separate screen and auto-fight for you based on size of your respective armies. Naval combat is also non-existent - enemy warships turn up but don't influence the battle's success
- Since military control is gone, you also can't send your troops to fight predators on the map like in the original
- Docks don't work properly - multiple docks don't do anything as the ships only queue at one dock
- The game doesn't tell you that you need wood (for scaffolding) or burial goods (the final step) to complete monuments. I sat there for ages wondering why progress halted before I remembered these steps from the original game (easily fixed by adding a couple more status messages for when you zoom in on the monument)
- The graphics are cartoony and what you'd expect from a mobile game

Pros:
- I appreciate the new options for global workforce vs walkers, off-road buildings, etc. It lets you choose the traditional Pharaoh experience or makes it more like the other entries in the original series (e.g. Zeus)
- The UI is improved (but it wouldn't even be a reskin if it hadn't)

I was a big fan of the original Pharaoh (like many others who bought this game immediately as it came out). Simply put, it was one of the defining games of our collective early gaming days. The developers might think that this is the only reason why people are giving negative reviews - the die-hard fans are throwing a temper-tantrum because not everything is exactly the same. I disagree.

First off, the graphics - you will see people generally split into two camps: Those who don't like the new, cartoonish graphics, and those who don't care. But you will rarely find people who outright think they are an amazing improvement. All in all, it's serviceable, but I preferred the somewhat more sober look of the original, rather than this new variety.

Second, the UI - parts of it are just poorly designed. Nothing a future patch might fix, of course, but where things are placed (such as which building is to be found where) make little to no sense, even if you never played the original.

Third, the bugs - there's a lot of them. Again, nothing that future patches can't fix, but it feels like this is something that the dev team could have simply delayed the release a couple weeks or months for, if necessary.

Fourth are the changes made to the original: Some are good - like the option (key word: option!) to have a global labor pool. The changes that are not optional, however, are almost universally bad. The new military system is entirely pointless and could have just been left out altogether. The fact that there is no minimap and no way to rotate the camera is also not exactly impressive. To remind everyone: These were features the base game had, and that was developed over 20 years ago! The excuse the developer gave for not being able to rotate the camera is that it caused issues with pathing. I mean, seriously...

There's also some general weirdnesses, like the fact that predators just gobble up your citizens and there is nothing you can do against it - in the original, you could use your police officers or your military to dispatch crocodiles or hippos, but in this game? You don't have a military to control and your police officers just ignore the beasts.

All in all, I wish the developers had worked on this a bit more carefully. The only thing I can really give the game props for is the music - a fantastic rearrangement of the original and I wish more companies went to such lengths to do justice to the original music of the games they are remaking.",1676819252,1676819252,False,14,0,0.602865874767303467,0,True,False,False

Pharaoh is follows its predecessors well, but the genre has moved forward from this early 90s mechanics. The characters and buildings remind more Clash of Clans than historical Egypt as does the gameplay. Every game is the same. Build city blocks that have access to the same resources, entertainment and religious buildings and rince & repeat untill you uninstall.

What happens if you don't have these buildings feels more like a bug than a mechanic - when there is one house that doesn't have police box near by your palace is going to be robbed by citizens 10 times in a row and there is noway you can punish the culprits for this. Just spam police boxes around until it ends.

- when new people come to town, some of them just walk to the other end of the map and disappear from map (all missions played)

- super annoying the pop-ups from gods when lavish and so on festivals are finish.  When you are trying to put some building down... you need to right click several times to remove the message dialogue from screen.

- on pyramids, the animations when workers pulling their carts on the upper layers of pyramid are broke. You can't see them walking on the actual layer, just appear and disappear. Very frustrating.

-When a festival to a god it's finish and try to add new festival and don't have money or beer , the error message it's behind the dialog box and can't be seen. 

- the messages from gods regarding blessings are extraordinary annoying when they are showing on screen because basically you can't do nothing other then just right click several times to remove them. It should be nice to have an option like in old one to have checkbox if you want them appear or not (or at least not so often).

- tooltip from Palace showing the stats are wrong especially on unemployment % because when you go on actual stats from ""Chief Overseer"" and shows you are short with 400 people and hovering the Palace tooltip shows -2 workers. (example).

- no mini map (really). 

- ""burial provisions"" from the stepped Pyramids are not every time working as it should. Linen for example I need 500 inside; I have on Storage Yard 500 and doesn't let me click the button inside the Pyramid because he shows 0/500 on Storage Yard. I need to restart the game and load the last save to pop up the message the I allready have 500 in Storage and put inside the Pyramid. 

And so on. I will come back with more when I find them. It's ashamed that a very promising game are so in harry launched after so many years of waiting. Hope for the best in the next patches, because we need a few to come at least near the original game.

The real deal-breaker is not adressing OG Pharaoh's bugs or design issues. Gave up at the Dahshur mission, because of the persistent trading dock problem.

The UI is confusing sometimes, in general all the left-side icons are not very differentiated or representative of their menu. Hard to guess if a god is pissed (maybe a little frowning, some kind of emotional cue needed?). The notch on top is too big and annoying.

In the french game, there's some some translation errors (inside monuments).
The loss of the minimap is something I can't understand. 

The combat system is unfinished and extremely disappointing. It was the main thing to improve, and 24 years later it feels like a regression from what the original game offered.

And many are added or persist:
- No minimap makes an overview of your city hard to see, and the zoom doesn't go out further than the original
- Combat in the original sucked, and the new one is less annoying. However, it could be more involved.
- If you pick a branched map, you can't go back and pick the other one even if you reload the previous town. You are HARDLOCKED.
- Overseer icons could be clearer
- The new menu is fine, but the original style was easier to navigate and had more personality
- houses frequently complain about lack of access to religion or doctors, even when next door to the relevant buildings
- The game seems harder - might just be me, might be the above
- Roads take money even if the tile doesn't place due to overlapping
- Many sprites of people have a pixel line of artifacting on one edge, particularly noticeable on juggler pins

Again I love this game! It just needs some fixing.

Edit: As the game continues, more issues!
- Monument randomly stopped building. Some report removing and replacing the camps to building helps, but I had to delete the whole thing and restart building it
- Military refuses to fill in one map, even with a surplus of weapons and all the correct facilities. I was pretty happy with this map! But after trying to troubleshoot, I might have to restart the map as I am being bent over and smacked by foreign millitaries as a result.

And another issue! Restarted the above scenario this morning, and what do I find?
My treasury is still emptied out from me trying (vainly) to keep the bugged military scenario afloat.

For one, armies were navigable within the map rather than some ""video of combat"" which doesn't actually do anything. The combat video plays but you don't see any units die or interact with each other. Soldiers just walk right through each other and head straight for the enemy archers.

Secondly armies used to be able to take out the crocodiles and hippos (which i haven't seen yet but remember seeing them by this level), and at the very least the cops would take out the crocodiles, but they don't now.

The Overseer of Commerce is a joke. The Stockpile button does nothing. It has a X on it, which you think means ""don't stockpile"" but it still stockpiles and says you have a surplus.

Quality-of-life has been improved in some areas leading to a more responsive UI and overall game. Menu options have been added to give players the option changing things like a global recruitment pool for workers or removing aggressive wildlife by checking a box. The art style too, while not a favorite, is far superior to the original for modern monitor resolutions.

The overall smoother experience though is contrasted by diminished gameplay, diminished information for the player and bugs that have not yet been ironed out. The game has also been made far too easy even on the hardest difficulty. If you played the original, it will be nearly impossible to lose to everything but the worst planning (not counting bugs.)

Combat while terrible even in the original has now been removed and the player no longer has control over military units whatsoever. Turning off aggressive wildlife in the menu is nearly a requirement as units can no longer leave forts and walling the wildlife away from citizens will destroy the games performance.

What combat has been replaced with is an auto battler 'simulation' that pops up on the screen when you are invaded, thought that does not yet work even in it's diminished capacity.

[i](and not in a good way...)[/i]

Three things about this game:

[hr][/hr][b]1st: It's totally broken.[/b][hr][/hr]
I faced so f*cking many bugs and in parts it's simply unplayable. I had to restart missions several times because I ran into bugs. Some (but not all) of the things I noticed:
- Buildings sometimes just don't work anymore and don't do anything again until you tear them down and rebuild them. Sometimes rebuilding won't work.
- Runners/Workers forget pathing and do not deliver after several gameplay hours. This basically breaks the game.
- The GUI sometimes flickers around and windows overlap until you can't play anymore.
- Mission restrictions (e.g. locked buildings) mean that you can't progress in missions unless you stick EXACTLY to a predefined building sequence.
- The game falls completely apart once you run into a shortage and therefore lose population. The downward spiral is not stoppable despite tweaked work priorities. Imports do not help either. You will inevitably lose, just because you didn't watch the food storage for a couple of minutes.

[hr][/hr][b]2nd: The interface is pure horror.[/b][hr][/hr]
Relevant and important information is hidden somewhere in submenus. You have to constantly click through windows and menus until you get to the most important and really BASIC information. Lists of goods, finances, trade, etc. are completely scattered in windows and menus. In addition, windows pop up all the time, which you have to click away all the time because they clutter up your screen. The game feels like a pop-up advertising simulator and everything that is relevant is hidden somewhere in 100 submenus.

[hr][/hr][b]3rd: Gameplay is the embodiment of evil...[/b][hr][/hr]
I understand: You like the nostalgia factor. And the cute little animated (and f*cking ugly) egyptian fellas evoke pleasant memories of a better time. But let's face it: They really did ""nothing"" to improve this oldschool mess of a game. It's boring, extremely frustrating and the ingame help is more or less a whole encyclopedia without a proper search function. You have to google almost every little gameplay function to proper understand what's really going on. The game doesn't show or deliver any kind of explanation what it is doing. Therefore: The only thing Pharaoh is actually archieving... you're a pro in game googling. And as soon as you got every strategy and a whole city up and running: Everything is easy as sh*t.

No, really: You have to spend hours to find the correct strategies. It's extremely frustrating, because there is no real learning curve: You have to google everything, because you often don't even know ""why"" something isn't working out. But as soon as you got to a working district setup, you basically print money. At least until the next bug destroys your game again...

This is just a lazy game port and in its core a broken and horribly bad game. I guess the original was somehow beareable - back then when we only had sticks and stones to play with and an *ss-r*pe game like this was more than nothing.

Pharaoh was the first PC game besides Need for Speed that I actually owned and played on my own computer back in 99. 
I am still playing the ""legacy"" version up to this date, therefore, a comparison only seems right. 

First of all: I´m glad a remake came out. Besides the full hd patch and some hot fixes there hasn´t been any kind of fix. Pharaoh and Cleopatra continued to have a stable amount of bugs for more than 23 years now.

While Ceaser 3 has a large mod ""add on"" in the form of Julius and Augustus, Pharaoh hadn´t.

Now it has. In the form of the remake.

After playing for a few hours (while simoultaneously playing the original pharaoh on gog) it´s time to rule judgement.

So, what´s good?
 + enhanced and added visuals that keep it true to the original game
 + somewhat enhanced and new interpreted versions of the amazing soundtrack
 + a Zoom in Feature
 + in general a lot of features you might now from Augustus (Ceaser 3 Mod) like a global labour pool and other tweaks that make the game more accessible and stable
 + customizable hotkeys (extra mention, since it´s so important)

What´s bad?
 - no Minimap (why? especially on larger maps a huge miss. Scrolling became a pain)
 - the UI (from a Usability, User-Experience and overall interaction design aspect it seems like there hasn´t been spent much on it - a lot of features don´t feel intuitive. Warehouse management and overseers became a pain. A lot of important hints, like specific numbers are just totally missing) -> Please hire a usability engineer or UX-Designer -> or at least listen to the people´s feedback - I still believe in this remake.
- still the UI - Somehow the original, 23 year old UI feels more thought through (while it is far from perfect).
- still the UI - A lot of menues seem reduced and somewhat ""childish"" implemented. Talking about a mobile style look. It´s neither user friendly or necessary on a full size screen.
- The military: Like it or hate it. But the new implementation seems like a cheap mobile mini game. (Not trying to be hateful here, but the old school, bugged out Pharaoh battles, while being a pain, were still fun) -> Military basically got reduced to zero with this new ""improvement"".
- A lot of dialouges and all Cut - Scenes had been cut out of the game.
- Overall it feels like you get a lot less, then compared to 23 years ago.

Why am I writing all this? Overall this game is still good. But if a friend would ask me, whether to start with Pharaoh, I wouldn´t recommend the remake, as it is of now. Some things need to be fixed. The UI needs a huge amount of refactoring.

I hope that this game gets a lot of updates in the upcoming 1-3 months, so it feels more like a ""complete"" game.

As of now I enjoy playing this remake and I think that I will play it through.

But to be completely honest: 

It is far from surpassing the old Pharaoh.

In case you think it´s nostalgia, that impacts my review, it´s unfortunately not.

While the modding of Ceaser 3 in the form of Augustus had won me over. This remake, especially for the long time it took to be completed, feels not finished.

Despite of the visual enhancement and some quality of life upgrades (hotkeys, global labout pool, a.s.o.) this game isn´t making the cut for me.

Nevertheless: Positive.

I'm writing this review as someone who played dozens of hours of the original Pharaoh.

If you have never played the original Pharaoh and enjoy city building games that are neither too easy, nor too complex, this is a great game to get. It has adorable graphics, an awesome soundtrack, and is fun to play.

If you have played and own the original Pharaoh, there's basically no reason for you to get this game. Apart from the widescreen resolution support, this game doesn't give you anything more compared to the original, and that's disappointing.

My main gripe with the original Pharaoh was the cumbersome interface. There was nothing intuitive about it so you really had to ""learn"" it. This remaster does nothing to improve that, and I'd say it makes things even worse because all the textual elements have been converted into icons that are difficult to understand. Eventually, you'll need to learn which symbol means what or just hover over it and wait for a label to appear. This is a huge missed opportunity because improving on the original interface could have been a major selling point for this game.

In addition to that, you can't rotate the map which is a major step back compared to the original. The unability to rotate the world in a 2D city building game is mind-boggling.",1676503833,1676746581,False,0,0,0.551777422428131104,0,True,False,False

Firstly, who signed off a ""city build"" game without screen rotation and a minimap? 

I played the original Pharaoh for hundreds of hours years ago and loved the idea of a revamped version. However the UI is now messy and not as clear as the original. Why change the onscreen icons from hieroglyphs to modern looking icons? The new soundtrack will definitely take some getting used to (sounds like a tribute band did the remake)!
To be fair I do like the option to ignore the gods and the Global employment pool option will make farming and trade much easier.

For someone who never played the original it might be OK, but (as seen in other reviews) the magic of the old version has been lost! Unfortunately I can't get the original to play on my system so I will (occasionally) tinker with this one!

If you're an old player:
Apart from some issues that still need to be resolved, and some features that are downgraded, or even missing (Such as battles or the minimap), the game's fine, at least to the point I've gotten so far. It might take an hour or two until you exit the mentality of the new game and familiarize yourself with the new UI and stuff, but after that obstacle, it's Pharaoh. It's a revision of an old time classic which feels smoother and more  modern than ever before. 

If you're a new player:
In my opinion, and the endless hours I've played the original (retail, not steam), Pharaoh is an excellent city builder. It's one of those games that are easy to learn but difficult to master. But for its time it had very well thought layers of complexity, making it challenging enough so that you don't get bored. You can always pay half the amount to get the classic, but if you'd like something more modern and polished, get this. It's still at least 98% the same game.

I'm about five hours in. It's a pretty faithful remake to the original, but I have some minor gripes here and there that I think would resolve themselves if this game receives mod support. Given that the game just came out, it wouldn't surprise me if some of these get resolved in the next few months.

Note to devs:
Thanks! I just found out about this game being a thing yesterday, and it really made by day. The quality of this remake is on the same level as the Monkey Island remake. This comes across as a product of passion. =)

Gameplay: 
An indication on fishing docks as to why they're not working would be handy. 

The ability to run two docks concurrently would be great, especially if I could dedicate each to a particular resource and have incoming trade ships dock at multiple docks.

When building monuments, it would be helpful to know what the bottleneck is. Eg, I don't have an easy way to answer the question of 'Do I have enough masons or labor camps nearby?'. Same issue applies to farms I suppose.

UI: 
There's quite a few minor annoyances in the UI. Most things require a lot of clicks through submenus. In fairness, the devs were likely trying to strike a balance between respecting the original, and modern UI paradigms, which are currently all mobile trash. Specific gripes are below.

Setting the risk filters (like fire/collapse/disease/etc) require many clicks, and you need to cycle through all of them while looking around your entire city. The risk views are probably important enough to have their own dedicated buttons on the top-level UI (along with remove filter button). A combined risk view would also be handy time/click saver.

The trade (import/exports limit) button could also use to be top-level.

When opening trade routes, it might be an improvement to just have a list so you don't have to click on every place on the map to figure out which ones are available. (Or at least maybe make a ghost line to them or something?) I didn't realize I could pan that map around for another one up north until my last mission was nearly over. Whoops.

Also, the event notification banners feel like clicking away popups on a warez site in 1999. Note to devs: Check out how 'Surviving Mars' handles event notifications. It's not perfect, but it is better. TLDR is that it uses bubbles on the left side of the screen.

The tooltips on the building selection menu (the right side toolbar) tend to get in the way. A 'short tooltips' option that just displays the building name and cost would be appreciated, or better yet, a 'hold ctrl for description' feature would be great.

Sometimes it's hard to place buildings on tiles that are occluded by larger buildings like temples. A feature to make those buildings transparent when holding a build tool near them would be handy.

The intro videos are forced on the first launch. I wish the devs could hear how loud I was mashing esc, space, enter, and mouse click. Might I suggest moving the intro video to campaign start? It's irritating to sit through an intro that's grainy because the graphic settings haven't been configured.

Adding hotkeys to tooltips for the building toolbar would be a welcome feature.

 For one, when a crime occurs (I don't know if it's just the first time or random) it'll pop up multiple times. This is annoying because it's one of the notifications that popup and there isn't a way to turn these off (even though there was in the original, or at least choose which ones you wanted to see)
Rotation is completely gone. I know others have said Flat mode is a replacement, but it really isn't. I tried it and it just makes everything (including rubble) into barely indistinguishable blank squares. This does not help when you have a tightly packed city and need to clear a collapsed or burnt down building without taking out something else accidentally. Besides which, I'm not sure why the devs removed this in their more ""modern version"" since camera rotation is a pretty standard feature in games, now. 
Another glaring issue I noticed is that the Political Overseer occasionally doesn't properly update when you're given a task from the Pharaoh. This may not seem like a problem, but these tend to be time sensitive (in fact I'm pretty sure the original even notified you when you could fulfill them, yet this doesn't happen here) so that sometimes if you clear the notifications  (like I do because I'm used to clearing them) You have to wait till the next one to pops up which could be WELL AFTER the deadline! 
I'm really not sure why they went with green to red gradients for the overlays system; it makes it much harder to use. Not to mention in the original with some of the overlays you could hover over them and get some info; I don't know if I'm missing something, but I haven't been able to get that to work. I guess I could understand why that wouldn't be included, but it was still nice to check on occasion. 
I know people go on about the graphics, but to me they just look like overly smooth versions of the originals, so I'm not really sure what people are on about (I even replayed the original; they look pretty similar, at least the characters and buildings) The UI takes some getting used to, not only because of the layout (in the options there's a setting to just leave all the submenus open. I'm not even sure why it's an option, because with it on it's either about similar to access things in the original or even slightly faster in some cases) At least the tooltips are fixed.",1676708085,1676708085,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the quality of life improvements like the grid on building tools, a more simplified U where you can access everything easily. Though the new music is great, I miss the old ones, so hopefully if possible they add it in the future. They removed the minimap much to my displeasure, but WASD navigation around the map is easier now and more responsive. I like the global employee system where it makes the game more casual friendly, and the battle system makes things less stressful.

5. Unable to remove 'objective' window at the top of the screen, making it take up space you may need to build
6. Some of the overlays dont really seem to work completely (desirability for example) but maybe thats just me wanting to not have to pause the game to hover over non color coordinated sections to see what the desirability is..

Again the game is great, but somehow the UI & combat is worse than the 24 year old game. I hope these get addressed in a future update.

Edit: More problems, no way to deal with predators? Old game you could use military or police but they completely removed the combat/military functionality beyond just building a fort. The police dont seem to do it as I've fed multiple departments to the crocs. Had to disable predators just to be able to use some farm lands.

This game has a few good enhancements but the more I play the more I miss the old one.",1676555601,1676689688,False,14,0,0.570349991321563721,0,True,False,False

The remake looks great. The aesthetic is a little more ""mobile game"" cartoony, but overall it's a huge improvement. This is mainly (along with some bug fixes) what I was looking for - a nice graphical revamp. 

So far, I've seen six major complaints, three of which I disagree with, and three of which I agree with and I sincerely hope the devs will address in short time. The three I disagree with: The music - I think it's fine and honestly, if you don't like it then switch it off and play whatever you want over the game; military changes - Original Pharoah's military was, frankly, garbage. I'm glad the devs recognised this and tried to replace it with something infinitely less annoying and less invasive to the main point of the game - managing a city. Perfect? No. Serviceable? Yes. Finally, the UI. It's different for sure, and I can see how the designers wanted to reduce UI bloat that would detract from city and landscape graphics. It just takes a little getting used to, but isn't intrinsically bad. A few more tooltips would really help here.

Now for the other three points, no minimap, no scroll speed slider, and no map rotation. These were pretty huge oversights and make me dislike playing far more than I should do. If these were design decisions then they were poor ones. If they were omissions in error, then it should be a priority to add them. In some ways, it beggars belief that such basic staples of an ergonomic user interface for any modern top down strategy game could be left out, but so long as these are added in due course, then all will be forgiven.

1. There's no minimap - 

This is true, however, after 13 hours of gameplay I haven't found myself missing it. With the ability to zoom out quite far, the minimap really isn't needed as much as the original game.

2. You can't rotate the map -

Indeed you can't but I never rotated the map when playing the original game so I personally don't think this is an issue. Plus this could easily be patched into the game given enough demand.

3. The tooltips and info display when hovering the mouse over the palace disappears too quickly. - 

I found this too, however, the tooltips behave normally when the game is paused so this is obviously a bug, one that I'm sure will be patched soon. 

4, The interface is too different from the original game, I miss the hieroglyphs! 

To be honest, I missed them too at first but I have quickly gotten used to the modern look and feel of the new UI.

5. The new art style is too cartoony and looks like a mobile game. - 

I thought this too at first but I have quickly gotten used to the new look and I now find it quite endearing.

6. The combat system is terrible!

Yeah, this one I entirely agree with. They could make it so much better by giving the player some element of control over their troops in battle or by having the ability of enabling the original style of combat in the gameplay options menu.

My verdict:

Even if all of the above issues were a major sticking point for me I couldn't imagine missing out on such an otherwise faithful recreation of a game I've loved since I was a teenager. Even with all UI and visual changes It feels like the same game - in fact it feels like a more polished version of the original without many of the game-breaking bugs that plagued many a playthrough.

1. The UI is very confusing, even for an avid and experienced gamer. Why is the storage yard with the bazaar and not with the ""production"" like clay pits and mines? Why are the architects posts, fire station, etc lumped in with the water supply and physicians section? So much weirdness I genuinely do not understand why they did it.

2. The battling system. Its ""remade"", in reality its just completely gone. Literally less player control than you'd find on some random mobile game like Clash of Clans. A screen pops up, you watch a horribly animated ""fight"", then its over. Yay? Guess I'll just spend all game worshipping Seth and let him strike everyone since military is completely useless.

3. Notifications and music. Both downgrades, notifications are now a huge bar across the top that you will 100% click on at least 10 times in each mission because they take a long time to vanish. The music is fine I guess, personal preference there but I feel like it no longer has the same soul it had in the original. How hard is it to make a setting that allows original music? Literally an additional folder and a toggle option in game, 20 minutes of developer time tops.

All in all, its a downgrade plain and simple. I can't think of a single reason to play this game over the original besides mildly better graphics. Even then, its not really different enough to matter.

I wanted to like this. I really did. I don't have a childhood nostalgia for Pharaoh (that's reserved for Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom), but I played the Steam version a few years ago and liked it, even if it felt dated in a lot of ways. I was eager to play Pharaoh with some higher quality graphics, mission select, maybe some optional rules like global labor, mods. But what I wanted out of this most of all was to play *Pharaoh*, just with more modern support. 

A New Era doesn't hit that mark. It doesn't even come close to hitting that mark. The devs should be ashamed of publishing this and demanding money for it. 

First of all, there are a number of bugs. Literal game-breaking bugs. For example, goods literally cannot be transported with a ferry. The walkers refuse to do it. So if you need to build a pyramid on the west bank of the Nile with stone that can only be quarried on the east bank? You can't build that pyramid. Houses that evolve to a higher level will often not attract migrants to fill vacancies. Tribute cannot be paid, constantly lowering your kingdom rating. Predators cannot be killed, meaning they will constantly eat your walkers with no way to stop them. 

On top of these game-breaking bugs, there's near-constant smaller issues and weirdness. The overseer telling you your salary is too high and lowering your kingdom rating, even though seemingly your salary is lower than your title. You build a storehouse and tell it to only accept pottery, but because for a fraction of a second after creation it accepted everything (by default) every delivery guy in the city can dump their junk there anyway. When you place a palace or mansion, you'll get notifications literally every second of people trying to rob it until you spam police stations around it. 

The UI is terrible. Icons are almost impossible to distinguish, especially at a glance. Good luck seeing the difference between the tiny brown rectangle on a brown background that indicates a shrine and the slightly bigger brown rectangle on a brown background that indicates a temple. Mission objectives are rarely written out and have a weird tendency to vanish. Overlays are a mess. There is no minimap, and the only way to move around the city is with an extremely slow pan. It literally takes me 20 seconds to go from one end to the other on a large map. 10 seconds even on a tiny one. When the icons aren't too crowded, they're obviously pulled from some stock database: A globe (with the Americas centered!) for the world map? A bar graph for overlays? An exclamation mark for notifications (which is a messy menu in itself)? Did the developers even try?

The graphics are... okay. The buildings are a bit nicer than the original, more high-definition. But the walkers and people in the building animations lack life. They look cartoony and robotic, and lack individuality. The bigger graphics, like the pictures of the gods, look basically the same as the original. Textures have a tendency to glitch out in reeds. 

The military aspect was changed to an autoresolve. It's a laughable autoresolve. I had two companies of infantry and one archer company fighting against 1 bedouin infantry and 5 bedouin archers. The game shows a video of ""the battle"", except there's not actually any fighting. The sides literally just walk at each other, in many cases straight through each other, and eventually start punching or shooting the air. This becomes an animation that loops indefinitely, like a gif. No damage is being done, no casualties, nothing. It looks worse than mid-2000s flash games. Then when you press Continue it shows the losses, and somehow I lost an archer. Made no sense. They shouldn't have been able to break through my infantry to kill an archer. My point is, ultimately it just makes combat utterly unexciting. Combat wasn't great in the original, but at least you did something, and there was a sense of accomplishment in a victory. 

Is there anything in this remake that's actually good? I suppose I like the game rules. Mission select looks nice. But other than that? I'm struggling to think of anything. If this was a fanmade free project, like Julius and Augustus for Caesar III, I could forgive some of these flaws. But for these developers to claim they improved Pharaoh and demand more than 20 bucks for it? Shame.

A lot of other reviewers make it seem like this game is already perfect for new comers and nostalgia enjoyers alike, or that it exists for no other reason than to figuratively assault their childhood but I'm here to tell you it's not worthy of such extremes. I was more than ready to love this game but it's not ready to handle taking the relationship to the next level. 
Having extensively played the original (a wonderful, also imperfect game, but for mostly different reasons) and many city-simulator games like it since I was a child, I can't recommend this remake in it's current state. [b]Far too many issues[/b] detract from an already uneven experience. Don't reward them for the state of this game by buying it now. It was clearly rushed out the door for a deadline even though it has been worked on for quite some time and it is clear why they did not allow any sort of early hands-on experiences to anyone; the opening hours of the game do not hold up to almost any amount of scrutiny.  

Cons
-UI is inferior in many ways compared to the original both functionally and stylistically. Removal of the minimap is a [i]prime[/i] example of this.  
-The gutting of the military system is questionable, not to say the original was great, but their implementation looks rushed and has several issues (multiple battles in a row? no clear victor in the actual battle screen, you have to hit continue or they just kind of dance at each other)
-Advisors report issues that defy reality. When you do what they tell you, it either doesn't change what they report or switches to another issue that also cannot be correct. Yet these ""phantom"" issues will seemingly stop the game from playing normally. 
e.g. High taxes prevent immigration - is that so? even at a 0% tax rate? :)))))))

-[i]Dozens[/i] of balancing, graphical and gameplay issues in the 6 hours I've played - too many to bother listing

Pros
-Works on modern systems and resolutions, runs well enough, new graphics are fine but are more cartoon-style than the more realistic take of the original
-Nice QoL toggle options and many small but nice tweaks - I'll thank whatever Egyptian god would hear me for the inclusion of the Global Labor Pool, the ""FROM - TO"" destination icons on individual workers and the ability to zoom in and out with a scroll wheel FINALLY
-I love the ""flat"" display mode, great for building and I think it works better than the rotate option they did away with even if it was nice to look at your city from different angles
-Tutorial is nice, if uneven and prone to breaking, and introduces some advanced concepts that the original never bothered explaining
-City sounds, general ambiance and the narration are copied from the source material from what I can tell. This is a great thing aside from them not remastering the narrator tracks leading to him being as ""compressed"" as he was in the original.
-The soundtrack is essentially a rearrangement of the original score. It certainly captures what I might imagine ancient Egypt sounded like roughly as well as the original did. The new score is serviceable though I still prefer most versions from the original but, hey, that may be down to my own nostalgia bias

Weird
-Strange balancing of certain industries  (one reed gatherer supplies six papyrus makers and still generates excess, compared to a 3:4 ratio of clay pits to potters, per their tutorial)
-A house wants to upclass but does not have enough room. Okay, give some space and guess what? When it does expand, it will never properly fill those vacancies. 
-Poor communication of what certain UI elements/graphs do or explain and by extension, a near total abandonment of the charming hieroglyphics system the original used
-Ever want to watch cartoon people get killed over and over by alligators and hippos? Watch your dreams come true in A New Era; animals have themselves a good old time at the expense of your city and its people because you can't actually control your soldiers to hunt them down. The silly dev must have known people would get tired of hearing the same death sounds hundreds of times because you're but one toggle away from stopping an endless cycle of killing. But in an even more odd twist, the constables and their now cosmetic whips can't fight them either. Why is that? 

The devs of this game have two other smaller indie games to their credit, one that draws heavily from the original ""Pharaoh + Cleopatra"" that A New Era is based on, so it's likely they loved Pharaoh and the rest of the ""Impressions Games"" collection as much as many of us do. Their game also had many issues at launch but did get better with time. This game will also get better with patches, I'm sure.

And I'm ready to do it again! And honestly, I've been enjoying this remake quite a lot so far. I feel like it stays mostly true to the original, despite some of the visual and gameplay changes.

Some of the reviews here are pretty harsh on the new UI, which i mostly disagree with. I seriously do not mind the new:
1) UI
2) Music
3) Graphics

The UI becomes familiar quite fast and is visually pleasing. Actually, pretty much everything in this game is visually pleasing.

The game also runs pretty well, with great stability. In addition to this, i haven't encountered any major bugs. The tooltips do bug out sometimes though, as well as the objective screen, but its a very minor thing. You also cannot use spaces and special characters when saving the game for some reason. The kingdom rating overseer also states that my kingdom rating drops because of inability to pay annual tribute, which is absolutely not the case. The battle screen doesnt actually show the resolution if the invasion, you have to just proceed to see the results. As well as some other small bugs. I am hopeful these things will be fixed shortly.

The new options are absolutely amazing! Being able to set the default storage to not accepting anything is great, as well as long awaited global employment and of course, being able to make your own keybinds. There are several other very convenient qol changes and options.

There are 2 biggest changes to the game that are very controversial to me.

1) Overhaul and complete automatisation of combat
2) No minimap???

Yes, the combat is now automated, meaning you dont actually control your troops, the entire RTS element is gone, as the battles now happen automatically. I cant say whether i like that or not, on one hand, not having to guess which direction the enemy troops will come in is great, on the other hand, not having to spend time with ridiculously clunky unit controls that the original game has is also great. Still, i believe this system should not have been removed entirely, and instead, remade to make the controls easier and removing the RNG element of the direction of the attack.

And secondly, why is there no minimap?? This is almost a dealbreaker for me. If the game wasnt so good in other areas i would not recommend it. Minimap is essential on bigger maps, as without it, moving around is a nightmare, especially considering that there is no scroll speed option... I consider this to be a huge oversight on the devs part, and will be absolutely expecting it to be added back asap!

Overall, none of the negatives outlined above, warrant a non-recommended status. The game feels great and im sure after collecting feedback from these reviews, the minor bugs will be fixed. And please, add back the minimap!!

+ Art style is a little bit cartonish but overall pleasant to look at.

+ I can now minimize it and even use windowed settings to play without getting graphical errors, welcome to 2023!

Negatives:
- UI is a lot worse than in orginal game. Its not intuitive at all. I understand they focused on minimalism but come on, its more similar to windows start menu.
- Combat system was reworked to the extent of being non existent. I know that ol' Pharaoh wasn't prime example of how it should work but thats not excusable, especially when you do remake from the ground up.
- There is no new campaign. I know its a remake but eh its a shame.
- They removed minimap. [Why?]
- They removed option to rotate map. [Why??]

I'm talking about graphics, assets, music (although the old music could be subjectively on par), sound editing and animations. Be aware though nostalgia can be a bit of a drug.

One thing that definitely needs big changes (and I mean I would remake the whole thing) is User Interface. It is extremely confusing. I find myself miss-selecting a lot of actions which icons are ether too similar from one another or too difficult to parse. The left side action icons are too modern and dislocated from the theme of the game (Ancient Egypt). There seems to be thought put into the organization of the actions but too little on the design, congruence and parseability of them.

There are other missing things from the original that don't understand why they were not included. The biggest one is map rotation. This is a city building game and it lacks the ability to see the city angles. Imagine building a huge palace and be limited to one side of it after building it. I am however hopeful they will add this feature latter because wow I can't believe this is not in-game.

While the updated (though simple) graphics and remastered music are wonderful, and there are a few nice features like ""hire anywhere"" that really open up how you can build your city, these do not justify the price. 
The UI isn't intuitive, there are still some glaring bugs (like monuments stopping construction half way through), and the changes to combat/military are simply pathetic. You can no longer rotate the map, there is no minimap, you cannot zoom out further, there is no way to see through/behind tall buildings, and the various information screens are painful to navigate. Not to mention the in-game notifications are assaulting: I'm talking completely freeze-your-game-rapid-fire-blast-your-entire-screen assaulting. GODS FORBID you let unemployment get too low because the Palace is the first place to lose its guards and you WILL get 50+ notifications on ""palace has been robbed"" while being completely unable to do anything about it.
Let's be honest, the original Pharaoh's combat system was as barebones as could be and not at all fun or engaging. However, the system they replaced it with is just as bad. It's a truly embarrassing low-effort mobile phone port of a ""watch these horribly animated soldiers walk slowly at one another without any sort of fighting or combat animations"". Honestly, if you are going to replace the OG Pharaoh military system have at it but this was the PERFECT opportunity to truly earn the title of ""Remake"" and the devs failed MISERABLY. I have no proof, but this really seems like an attempt at a phone-port now being sold as a PC exclusive for an inflated price tag.

PROS:
Great music
Updated graphics
Runs on modern machines

CONS:
Loss of navigation features from the original game
Bad military system replaced with cheap phone-game knockoff
Still some frustrating bugs
Awkward UI/Menus

Despite a few minor flaws (which I'm hoping get a fix) I've been having an amazing time in one of my favourite city builders from when I was young.

Pros: 
-Follows the original very closely, even down to the little peculiarities of the original engine. I believe they said they'd rewritten all new code for the remake but if so they must have lifted the original mechanics precisely.
-Great art, feels like a slight style change over the original 90s low resolution realism but I think it does a decent enough homage. I've seen complaints over the little animated NPC's new designs but they were tiny pixelly blobs before so it's not like they replaced something central to the experience. I think they're fine, personal preference.
-Music slaps (so did the original's)
-Zero crashes or performance issues. Not that that shouldn't be the base expectation, especially for a 2D game, but video games in 2023 be like
-Tons of content, the original campaign + Cleopatra expac is a LOT of playtime and I love this kind of campaign.

Cons:
-Few bugs here and there (I think, could be user error), a few issues of goods not moving to the right spots or getting traded that was fixable with some messing around, and some very minor stuff that I've forgotten the details of. Definitely nothing game breaking, but some polish from the devs.
-Some peculiarities in the UI, and I wish you could see the mission story blurb from the campaign map. I will say that I don't remember the original game's UI being a masterpiece either so you win some you lose some.
-No map editor yet but they've said it's coming.

Ehs:
-New battle sim system. I understand replacing the original way you'd control little squads on your map and enemies would spawn in, it was pretty janky and losing basically meant your entire city was gonna get trashed. The new system is convenient at least, doesn't put the game on hold for as long, though I think it should be a little more punishing than just blowing up a few buildings if you lose. Maybe start some fires all over the place or something. Also you still have defensive structures you can build that don't do anything anymore (I think?), so finding a function for those as a defensive bonus or something in the new system would be nice to have it be a bit more integrated. Battles were never a defining part of the game and it's not an objective downgrade so I don't have a strong opinion here.

This remake was everything I was hoping for. It's polished and updated. The graphics are beautiful as is the music. Sure it can use a minimap and yes I want to create my own maps again, but those aren't deal breakers! These are items that can be added down the road. The ability to build more pyramid or monuments than the previously game limited to you to 3 would be amazing.

To those whining about the ""combat"" this is a city builder. If you want combat go play something else. I loved the original game and am enjoying what the devs have done with this updated version. I look forward to what else they have in store for us. This clearly was a labor of love for them for any of you that followed the game in development.

But if you, like me, played the original then this feels like...I dunno, a remake that tried to remake the things that did not need a lift-up. 

- I cannot possibly get used to the new UI, it's unintuitive, I played this game for about 8h now and I still look for the buildings I built hundreds if times now.
- The new advisor tabs? The same thing, I learned two, maybe three of them but still click through all of them to find what I need.
- I miss the little buttons that led to advisors from in-game popup windows. I miss being able to got straight to the religion advisor when a feast begins to start a new one.
- And oh boy, do I miss the minimap. What on earth led the devs to release a city builder of this scope without a minimap? I'm so tired of slowly scrolling the view with my mouse.
- The mission outros are not even voiced :(

What I do like from the new changes is the combat. Hated it with a passion in the original, but here we got an automated outcome depending on the number of troops we have. I imagine it might be a frustrating change for some, I leave it for you to decide.

I expected more, but will play it. But when the times comes to replay the game again I'll be back to the original.",1676642388,1676642388,False,8,0,0.553571403026580811,0,True,False,False

I've been following this game for several years now, all the way back to its announcement. I bought the game as soon as I got the release notification, and while I was initially excited at the prospect of one of the defining games of my childhood being remastered and optimized for modern hardware, that excitement quickly faded after seeing the game's art start to come together. No shade towards the artists that worked on this game; I'm sure they gave it their best. But I really cannot accept the decision to get rid of the sprite art that made old Sierra games so charming to look at, coupled with the stiff animations that look like they came out of a flash game (or a Unity game, for that matter). 

My heart sank within the first minute of playing. Seeing the first immigrants shamble over to the housing markers I had established. The weird softness of the wild ostriches. It has all the charm of a million-polygon motion-blurred Mario running around in Unreal Engine. I'm thankful that most/all of the original voice lines are still in the game, but none of the original cutscenes made it into the remaster. It was actually jarring to start the first campaign mission without hearing that [i]""It is said that the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step...""[/i] cutscene. You can call me nitpicky, but the original game is too near and dear to my heart to be satisfied with what I had played. 

I wish I wasn't writing this review. Perhaps I had too much faith in Dotemu. Their track record isn't bad at all when it comes to re-releasing old games on modern hardware. Maybe I should have done my due diligence on Triskell Interactive, maybe they just bit off more than they could chew. The delays to the game's release certainly didn't give me any more confidence. Maybe my expectations were just too high, like I was expecting a similar remastering treatment to C&C Remastered which is a real marvel of doing everything possible in service of preserving the spirit of the original. I'm just so disappointed, and it only took me less than 15 minutes to reach that conclusion. 

If your relationship with the original Pharaoh+Cleopatra sounds like mine, please do yourself a favor and just stick to the original. There is a mod that allows the game to run at modern resolutions, and I guarantee you'll get more satisfaction out of it than the asking price of this remaster.",1676639663,1676639663,False,6,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's also pretty clunky and unfinished. Instead of fighting in the city there's a screen with battle preview... that doesn't work. Units move and start attacking but no hp is lost and army bars don't budge. After closing this down you get a casualties screen. Its pretty obvious they failed to make battles in the city, then rushed a stop-gap solution and didn't finish it either. You can play the mission, you will get more losses with more evenly matched armies, so it doesn't completely derail the game but its really the minimum.

Art looks nice but it doesn't mesh so well. While building monuments the workers are not positioned quite correctly to their 3d position. I've only done one monument but I think there was some a big mis-match with the top layers. Animations seem to me to be very miserly. There was one or two that looked nice, but its mostly super short loops (like less than a second runtime short). It looks like a wasted opportunity to have extra life in the city in the new remake. Fun extended animations popping up sometimes or at least very well made loops. With modern hardware you can zoom in, you'd hope to zoom in and see cool detail, but if you zoom in it looks pretty bad with people jittering on short loops. Water flooding looks very bad and it doesn't handle people caught in it.

Music is great, exactly what I would hope for from a remake.

UI is atrocious. I don't know what makes it so off putting but I find myself not wanting to use it. May be a good case study to get original and remake side by side and analyze exactly what went wrong. Maybe big problem is from splitting overlays and overseers on both sides, so if you want to check something, build something, check something you need to go over the entire screen a couple of times? Maybe strange behavior on RMB where I'd expect to stop editing something and entire window closes?

I would have preferred the approach from AOE2 DE for example, where they just improved the graphics and added some minor QOL features, while overall keeping the game the same. In this case they have largely redesigned the game and changed a lot of it's features.

Some things are just personal preference. I'm personally not a fan of the mobile game like cartoony style that they went with. Especially in menus and stuff it doesn't really fit the game. And even though I like the remade music I would have liked the option to choose the old one too, just for the nostalgia. 

Things that are more hard dealbreakers though: No minimap! I have only played a few scenarios, building just tiny villages so far, and it's already becoming a struggle to not have any overview of your surroundings. If not a minimap, then there should a least be possible to zoom all the way out. 

As many other have mentioned: The UI. The old one was perhaps not the prettiest but it was intuitive, with distinct hieroglyph style icons that were easy to tell apart at a glance (and fit the spirit of the game). Here they have gone for some sort of detail view of various things, that in the small scale just makes it all look the same. I find myself often just clicking through them at random trying to find the one I want. 

A lot of parts just lack information in general. There are icons and numbers without any info of what they show. 

Pros:
The new intro is great. Even my heavy nostalgia can't hide how ugly the original one was. 
The Global Worker Pool. I don't use it myself since I like the city planning part of creating a good mix of areas, but more options are always good. 
And I love the fact that is still has the bug (is it a bug?) where the traders complain that the city doesn't want to trade even when they are actively trading. 
More options for beautification.
Docks can choose what goods they accept (YES! This is the kind of QOL features I was hoping for)

I've been waiting eagerly for this release for a long time. Hopefully I get to update this review to a more positive one eventually.

while i will absolutely continue playing this game, i really hope to see some updates to fix both minor and major problems i've noticed

minor:
-some spelling and formatting mistakes in notifications, as well as options menu and even the encylopedia. on it's own a funny little thing, but small stuff like that can hint at bigger problems, or even make bigger problems more obvious
-some graphical issues with citizen sprites. i'm noticing builders for the pyramids end up getting hidden behind the graphic for the pyramids, or not stopping their walking animation. also a few different sprites have weird ""cutout"" edges on their animations (great example is the 4 dancers at the dance school/pavilion. little black lines towards their legs making the animation box more obvious)
-the UI feels somewhat non-intuitive in places. i find myself constantly clicking the different advisors buttons because i can't remember which button is what for example.

middle:
-more a pet peeve, this is basically a remaster of an old game. computers have significantly improved, so i feel like there could be a larger variety of stock maps. there appears to be a suggestion of being able to make custom maps, but i can't find access to that in the current game (maybe it's there or even a separate program and i'm just missing it? but if so i feel like this needs to be more obvious)
-no minimap? or map rotation? why remove these? also, no ability to rotate pyramids so you can place the wood boards on a different side?
-overlays are largely useless. it's awkward and weird to cycle through them, and the color gradient is harder to understand than the old pillar type system. 

major: (generally game mechanics)
-generally speaking, in the original game, on normal difficulty, i never remember having immigration problems. but this game i seem to constantly have this problem, where i'm providing for everyone but am hated. or taxes are too high even though i'm set to the default 9% tax rate? 
-i have had several points where i'll click on citizens and they'll complain about non-existent issues (such as complaining about slums even though every single house in the city was level 6+)
-also had pyramids complain about lack of access when the road is literally connected and it's actively receiving goods/being built
-clicking on citizens is also a little wonky, and it feels like they have significantly fewer dialog options compared to the original
-i have had issues with storehouses glitching and showing stock but that stock not actually existing. can't clear the stock out, and if you set it to empty, a delivery cart gets sent out that is completely empty. only way to fix this is to delete the storehouse. best i can figure is it is related to exporting surplus vs exporting over a specific amount. the surplus option can cause problems with the storehouses
-i also had a game where as soon as i built the palace, within the span of a minute it had been robbed about 5 times for 1k gold a piece, before i could do anything to respond to it.
-the hover pop up help text tends to vanish way too quickly to read after being on a map for a while. when you first start the map, it's not a problem, but as time goes by it stay up for less and less time.

as it stands, the big benefit to this is being able to play pharaoh again without looking for patches to help it play on modern PCs. but this small hurdle, as well as the removal of some of the UI elements of the original (minimap and rotation) make the original still far more worth the money to get.

there are some QoL things that i think could push this game to be more worth the price, besides correcting the issues listed
-introduce custom map maker and have it be more expansive than the original. larger maps too would be great. being able to build a sandbox with no limitations on what monuments you can build or gods you can worship would be excellent
-ability to turn off gods in sandbox games, at the very least. i just wanna build a city, not constantly checking to see if a god is getting angry out of the blue. but turning off worship of a god in the original removed the ability to even build temples, which limited city growth if memory served.
-better ability to track the gods moods. it's very easy to forget about them while you let your city run, having maybe a hover text over each temple saying what the mood of that current god is?
-more citizen dialog/ambient noise. make it feel much more alive. 
-ability to cycle citizens when you click on overlapping ones. or even click on citizens that might be overlapping a building, instead of always defaulting to the building

among many other small things that could help the game feel a bit more alive. don't really need to introduce new mechanics (being a facelift of an old game is great on it's own), but if you want to tout accessibility, there's many other areas where QoL and UI can be improved to do so",1676619639,1676620918,False,85,0,0.796560287475585938,0,True,False,False

1) The combat seems like something an intern would make. I did a better job at college back in 1999 using flash player as part of an assignment! You cannot control units of soldiers and ships like the original, it's just an incomplete, terribly animated and rushed ""movie"". I know city building is the main focus of this genre, but the warfare was what completed the original game, not to mention warfare was a major part of Egyptian history. Also, soldiers could kill crocodiles, now they just roam and kill your people!

2) Very simple to fix bugs: like hovering your mouse over the population or money, the information does not display properly and it's really frustrating. Anyone testing this game would have noticed this and probably notified someone. However, this is just another rushed beta release and they probably didn't have the time to fix it before the deadline. It's much easier to apologize for a shoddy release than it is to push back a deadline.

3) No minimap. Was this truly so difficult to implement? This should be a basic feature.

4) Glaringly obvious typo errors that you'd expect a child to make.

5) Lackluster UI. The original game's context menu and building menu had a truly Egyption ""feel"" to it. This version doesn't seem so authentic or artsy. Also, the way some of the building menu options appear make no sense or is broken and needs reworking.

On the positive side:

1) Global labor pool; This means you can maintain a perfect ""roadblock"" system of city building without needing houses to be so close to industry. 

2)Updated graphics and sound, looks and sounds more crisp, especially in 4k. Although zooming in, the picture quality degrades.

- Having the ability to see how long it's been since the last festival directly from the festival square
- Fixing the tooltip when you hover over the village palace (currently only works when paused)
- Providing some more tooltips in various advisor spots where there aren't any
- Implement a minimap (I believe they might be adding this but am not sure)
- Allow us to right click to select buildings/people after built (honestly it's muscle memory at this point)

So I have a great passion for the original game, let me start with the TL:DR - it is a great game overall, but there's some infuriating choices made for the remake.

GRAPHICS:

Some people don't like them, I think the charm of the original is what it is, charm. Nostalgia. The modern graphics are nice and crisp - though it doesn't support my ultra-wide monitor (21:9) so I play with black bars sucks but it's not a negative.

The game looks very mobile-focused, the sidebars (for overlays, buildings, etc) are FAR too small, especially on modern monitors (I have a 25"" ultra-wide, so it's not the largest there and I play in 1080p, not 1440p/4K). They need to be bigger - also the menu is poor. There are *only* icons, sure you get the name when you hover over the icon - and yes this is just re-training my eyes from 24 years of what it was originally but there was no real reason the original didn't work?

SOUND:

The music has been re-composed, re-mastered? Theyre fine, I have for periods of time with the original played without the music on. You go through phases with any music you hear constantly for 20+ years - I feel very neutral on this, though some have really gone off about how they dislike it. Seriously, just get the OST from the original, play it in VLC media and mute the in-game audio.

No clue about licencing, but the game could have options for original or remaster? That's something above my pay grade.

REMOVED THINGS:

- Removed mini-map: Not such a big deal since you can use the mouse-scroll to zoom in/out. I think it is better this way, I almost never looked at the mini-map originally... I think this decision is fine.

-Dynamic Scrolling: When my mouse hits the edge, it un-selects whatever I'm building (usually a road) and deletes my progress - why? I cannot move around the map using edge of screen scrolling. This is a massive oversight in design. I hope this isn't because there is no ultra-wide support because this is very disappointing.

- Rotate map view: This is weird, why? You cannot rotate your map to view other angles, in a 2.5D isometric game this makes it *very* limiting in what you can see. When you try placing objects, the other objects dont turn translucent, thus making placing items very tedious. This was a bad decision.

- User Interface: Please have the option to use the original view, the larger icons are the way to go. Sure those who played the original on modern hardware (who didn't use or know about the modern resolution patch that is out there for the original) can complain 1200x760 on a 4K monitor is awful but its a 1999 game in 2022. They have a work around for that - WHY not implement that methodology here?

- ""Micro"" Military: I'm torn on this, yes the original military was one of the worst aspects to the game. But to go completely ""off-screen"" with military is a mistake. You could play the whole original story with only going through half a dozen forced military missions (if you always chose the peaceful mission when given the option in Pharaoh, Cleopatra didn't have this). This is also good because one of the worst parts was removed, but it's 2023 and a 1000x better engine (Unity Engine I believe) how difficult would it be to re-work the military? I'll give them a pass on this, and say it's an overall net GOOD.

- Changed hotkeys: By default they're all removed. This is a massive mistake (removing on default), but I understand why we moved from an arrow key movement system to WASD. I remember the early 2000s, and WASD wasn't an industry standard. You can change/add hotkeys through the menu. Overall this is fine, but as a 24 year veteran, this was a difficult adaption process - I just changed it all to original Pharaoh defaults... 

NEW THINGS:

- Options Menu: Jesus, thank you, lol. You can make several changes, honestly some break the original game (Global Labour Pool) and others are a MASSIVE QOL IMPROVEMENT - having bazaar's/storage yard's to ""Accept None"" by default is HUGE! When you have massive populations and dozens of yards and bazaars, keeping track is difficult. Defaulting to accept none is perfect, since the game doesn't handle 2x food or 2x goods from one bazaar very well. Overall I love this, maybe my favourite thing in the game.

- Difficulties: What I'd call ""new"" is a re-work, sure Very Easy was a joke (didn't need physicians or apothacary or water for satellite housing for industry) and Very Hard was absurd (having to build in very very specific orders was tedious and stressful for initial populating of your map). Though to what extent ""Hard"" is difficult remains to be seen.

THINGS TO BE ADDED:

- Map Editor: I have some a couple maps myself, and I cannot wait to see what the community has in store. There wasn't a whole lot of map creators originally so this I'm looking forward to.

- Mod Support: I don't think there will be many mods, like what will you mod in? I could see graphic enhancements, maybe someone will mod in the original military? This is going to be interesting!

MY SUMMARY:

- The good things are good, some are even great. Like the settings.

- The bad things are just downright awful. Changes to UI and the User Experience have made the game worse compared to the original - maybe the young pup's who haven't played this game since 1999 will not have this issue so I find it hard to really say this is overall negative.

- The graphics are fine. Just fine. The sound is fine. Just fine. You can always just not have the audio on, and the gog version of Pharaoh (don't get the steam version) if you don't like the graphics.

Overall it's Pharaoh and Cleopatra. In 2023. With modern resolutions, no need to install a third-party patch. Likely easier to stream with - which is ALWAYS a good thing. I don't want to gatekeep this amazing game, so more eyes on this game is great. Sure I will say this game is inferior (overall) to the original, but it's still a great game.

The city building aspect is still solid, I have to review source code and see what changes there are in comparison to the original (I know all the ratios and such for the original like shrines being more efficient for god appeasement compared to temples using similar space).

Some particularly weird design decisions of note are to remove the minimap and rotational camera that existed in the original 1999 game. I don't see any reason why these wouldn't be in this game, they're hardly difficult to implement and are quite crucial. The minimap is important for the modular-style building Pharaoh promotes, and the design of the game naturally promotes really condensed buildings which mean without a rotational camera many areas of your city end up completely obscured.

It's been said by many people but the replacement of military conflicts with some weird flash-style simulation is ludicrous, it feels so pointless. It also means you can't use your archers to deal with predators anymore, making crocodiles and hippos far more of a pain than they ever were. I've opted to just turn them off because of this change, because constables are useless at getting rid of them. Military conflict was never a particularly fun part of Pharaoh for me, but at least it felt it had weight - now it feels utterly pointless and that the game would just be better without it completely.

The UI is far more unwieldy than the original UI - at first I thought it was just because I wasn't used to it, but certain elements of it are just undeniably frustrating, and inconsistent. Then there's the bugs - for a game so heavily delayed it's really disappointing to see so many bugs. There's also spelling errors, grammar errors and other signs of a rushed product.

Overall though I do still recommend this game - it's a faithful remake of a genuinely amazing game, and the amazing nature of the original allows this to hold its own too.

Besides some really annoying bugs (I'm sure they can be fixed, but how can you release a game when you know that the hover over building is not functioning?), the decisions and changes the creators made are ruining quite important features of the original game. Only a handful of them were changing the game in a positive direction.

Good:
- graphics upgrades and art solutions are generally fine and loyal to the original. (Except for the UI icons)
- some options to reduce the stress of the game if you like a more comfortable experience (most importantly, the option of having a global labor pool)
- sounds and music are largely similar to the original, even though I personally prefer the old ones
- some new kinds of beautification are really nice
- once you're allowed to trade, economy tends to work very smoothly

Bad:
- There is no minimap (makes harder to get an overview of the map and navigate between parts of your city)
- The map cannot be rotated (which was a really important feature in the original game, as some of the buildings are really tall and without enabling rotation, you have no other option to see what's behind a tall building but deleting it).
- The military aspect has been completely ruined and is literally a joke in its current state. In addition, Seth is doing nothing, no matter how much he likes you (or at least nothing I could notice during this incredibly dumb and ridiculous simulated combat). 
- The deities, in general, are overly simple to please even when there are more of them available.
- Citizens are overly sensitive to any changes in taxation or wages. Even a minimal wage reduction and/or tax raise will lead to losing hundreds of citizens unbelievably fast, so this political option is practically missing. I'm pretty sure that in the old game the effects of picking the wages/taxes a little wasn't so drastic and immediate (even though it could be, if you kept them at levels disliked by the population for an extended period of time). 
- The economy is practically unsustainable without export profits or gold mining. The difference between total wages and total tax income at the default rates is insignificant. 

Even though I could continue the list extensively (e.g. the UI, the texts, the missing cutscenes, the missing atmosphere/vibe etc.) this is more than enough to jump to the conclusion: the remake is not really what they promised; the things they kept from the original are good, the things they did not keep are painfully missing, and the things they changed are mostly horrible. And I'm sorry for that.
I still want to say thanks to the developers, especially for making it happen, reviving this (g)oldie for a new generation of players and for the old timers alike, and for the fine artwork they did with the high-res buildings and characters.",1676586336,1676586336,False,7,0,0.558355391025543213,0,True,False,False

-the original allowed you to customize notifications showing up. Now you just get spammed relentlessly and can't turn them off
-for the love of god, please make the tutorial optional. Ive played this game for 20 years. For what its worth, the tutorial is well made and for the new players it will be a welcome addition!

The good stuff:
-optional global workforce. Love it, I always hated making slums in the original
-massive improvement to docks by allowing them to only accept certain goods

As for the remake, it's... odd. Positives: The new art in the overworld and cutscenes is beautiful. The overworld has the same charm as the original, and the lineartless opening cutscene blew me away with how much better it is compared to the old 90s CGI. The speed-up toggle and ability to skip the recruiter system are also welcome QoL improvements.

However... the UI. Tooltips and other in-game text that didn't need to be rewritten at all are now muddled, confusing, and riddled with grammatical errors. Having overseers and overlays on the left-hand sidebar is more convenient, but the generic buttons on the left and right sidebars are dull and lack the personality they used to have. Some functions are actually harder to find than they used to be -- for example, I could only find the stockpile resource toggle because I knew it had to exist somewhere. And hover tooltips sometimes decide to just not exist. I'm really not sure the UI overhaul is truly an improvement; the original had 90s menu syndrome, sure, but it wasn't bad for all that.

I really hope the devs can address some of this stuff, especially basic QC of ingame text because man, it's sloppy. I still love this game and I'd still encourage people to check it out if you're into complex management crunch type stuff, with a side of historical accuracy and gorgeous isometric visuals.

I'd like to write a little review of this game to help give a fair analysis of it for people who are still not sure if they'd like to get it or not. I am someone who has very much played the original since I was introduced to it in 2000. I was filled with excitement when I discovered this game was being revived because I had no idea there were many people who knew what it was anymore. Please keep in mind I am not exactly a tough critic. I do not play games like this trying to find every tiny little detail that makes me upset so I can go complain online about it.

From what I've experienced so far, I think this is a wonderful remake of a beloved classic. A lot of times when something like this is remade, people are displeased with things being changed too much and the game losing it's original charm. I am happy to say that the team kept to the spirit of the game and this is a remake that most veteran players should be pleased with. Everything looks the same, yet upgraded. Objects look smoother and you can zoom in closer to your town than ever before to admire the little details. (An example being I found myself delighted just watching the water move about in the water carrier's well).

They also kept the voice of the original narrator I believe (who did a perfect job) and really helped solidify this as the Pharaoh game we all knew and loved. The original music is there, but has been remixed/remastered. You are still hearing the familiar tunes you used to, but the soundtrack itself is softer. I personally like that for a more relaxing city building experience!

There are some great changes they did make from the original such as being able to select what style of garden you place down, and even better, no longer having work seeking walkers. This will let us make beautiful thriving towns without the mining slums I would often end up with on some of the later maps.

Some people are going to find any little thing to complain about. ""The game was changed too much"", ""the game wasn't changed enough"". ""It's too easy now"". ""It's too hard now"". ""This very specific feature that I used wasn't brought into the new game and now the entire game is ruined for me."" Etc. Etc. Everyone is allowed their own opinion, but keep in mind that some people like complaining. Some people go into a game trying to find every tiny little pixel that itches them the wrong way just so they can claim the whole game is terrible.

If I had any complaints to share about the game myself, I would have to say that yes, it does remind me of mobile game graphics, but I still stand by my original statements up above that I also am enjoying seeing all of the little details that we couldn't before. I also heard that the military has been changed/toned down to almost nothing and I did have quite a bit of fun with that in the original so I do fear that will be a bit of a disappointment for me. However! This is Pharaoh, a remake of a game we all thought was going to fade away into the past, but this team brought it back, and did a fantastic job.

1.  I like the new graphics and scaling, really is a huge improvement from the original.
2.  Of the 3 missions I have done thus far they have stayed true to the original game and that's fantastic.
3.  UI needs a little help.  I realize change is difficult but there are too many clicks to get to items.  Having some items in the left side, others on the right doesn't seem right or perhaps not as intuitive as it should be.
4.  Actually really like the new building tool for roads, which makes design easier.  And the tutorial bits are helpful.

The crux of it is this for me.  I would have paid $20 for an updated version of the old game with things such as official widescreen support etc..  But I got much more than that for $20 and I'm quite happy with that.  

I've logged hundreds and hundreds of hours on the original.  Based on that math, this is pennies per hour to play for me.  If you liked the original you should get this, and if you didn't play the original play the best city building sim there has ever been.

Edit:  After a few more hours I have a few easy things that would make this better, and I believe most of these to be easy fixes.

1.  On your world map when you select a trade partner and open a trade route, have a link to the commerce overseer to set up the amounts.  I shouldn't have to navigate back to the beginning and start over.

3.  The new UI for battles is a great improvement.  Love to see this type of change.

4.  I'm getting used to the new AI and icons, but things are too buried when you start to explore and you need a way to go back one screen in the process without starting over.

First and foremost: the graphics is gorgeous! Buildings, people, animations... everything has received a new, clean and modernized graphic, while keeping the traditional artstyle. There is few graphic bugs, but nothing severe.
There is various upgrades on the quality of life, like spawnpoints of walkers, nilometer and a more defined UI, but more on that later.
The design is stylish, and easy to read, especially the building menu, maybe it need a bit of definition the sub-categories headers.

What is suffer is the left part of the UI.
- Layers are fine, clear and simple, but I miss the overseer screen where you could check them all by having them on the lower bar, the left overseer menu is rather bland.
- And what is the point of the ""objective"" menu if it doesn't show the objective but only the intro text, and you have to check the overseer to see it? [u]Suggestion:[/u] since is already there, and the few frist missions give you a sort of ""minor"" objective, why not write them there in a check-list fashion? Because if you clear the alert tabs, it also clear the objective, weirdly enough...
- About the alert: in my experience, plagues don't show automatically, but robberies KEEP BLOCKING ME! I think there is a menu option, I have yet to check it.
- The encyclopedia and manual are painfully basic: if you have more than 50 entries, why not divide them into categories? And why not put some images, even in-game ones? I don't mind read, but I'm not a fan of walls of text, especially compared to the game graphic improvements.
- Lastly, I might have missed something, but where is the minimap? Either there isn't one, or I'm dumb enough to not have found it.

What is really bugging me is the main menu, it works fine but... again, feels bland. I believe is another victim of the ""oversemplification"" and ""accessibility"" of many remakes suffer. Plus I feel it ""slow"", and the ""return"" buttons are really small compared to the rest of the UI.
I appreciate the remade music, but an option to play the remastered or the original (or heck, why not both) ones would be appreciated, especially by nostalgic people like me. Another thing is the oddity of listening them in the headphones: some high pitched notes are screaming into the right ear, while the left feel mute, but might be something on my headphones, I'll check.

I recommend it if you are new to the genre, Pharaoh: A New Era is a good entry, and I think it was the aim, altough it suffer some bugs but all fixable quickly, I believe.
For those who played the original and went here for the nostaligia, wait a bit. Let the devs fix it, especially the points I made, because you will probably feel like ""meh"" or disappointed.

It is so nostalgic for me and cosy that I even have put on long plays of the game to fall asleep to. I had been waiting for this version for a long time and was very excited. Unfortunately and really sadly, i personally can't recommend it in its currant state. I only could play for a very short period of time before having to stop. I stopped because I would rather wait for it to have improvements done before I continue (so am requesting a refund). Currently in my opinion the game is not close in quality to its original. The art is the only thing that feels better to me. The inability to turn the view wouldn't normally bother me that much but it causes issues such as not being able to see what you need to delete or move. In the short time i played i already had situations where i couldn't see what the issues were till i realised a blockade i couldn't see was the problem. This maybe could be fixed by at least making important things that are blocked from view have a glowing outline or something as I realise they probably cant implement turning the view at this stage very well. Also I'm uncertain what is the problem but the way I play the game is seemingly impossible. I think it might be to do with the blockades or something stopping the guys looking for job positions filling roles. Overall its near unplayable for me the way it is with my play style. Not sure if that will ever change or i will just have to relearn. I am not sure why they couldn't use the original music or just remake it, i'm guessing licensing issues. But the current music is not great and compared to the old stuff it's pretty bad. Other than that there's a lot of small broken issues that i imagine will be fixed hopefully such as the overlay titles that tells you what they are for wouldn't show up properly. Some icons are very hard to tell what they are and sometimes music gets cut randomly. Some pop ups have sounds while others you expect to have sound do not. Makes it all feel very unfinished. I know iv said a lot of negative things but its all just because i love the original and really hope they improve this game. Although i don't recommend it now, hopefully in the future I could but as it is released as a finished product I am reviewing as one.

Or at least, if you want to create one, make sure you don't make a game like this, which contains lots of ABSURD DESIGN DECISIONS that seriously affects gameplay and have no hope to be fixed.

I shall point out a lot of dubious designs, as well as janky stuff and bugs from this game that are missed by most reviews, and which you can encounter BEFORE FINISHING THE FIRST MISSION. I think they should be clearly listed out, so buckle up, here we go:

- Booting up the game: there is already a bug! The game erroneously unlocks an achievement at the starting cutscene. Already a good sign.

- Entering the main menu: why is my PC fan getting louder? Turns out this game is VERY POORLY OPTIMIZED: starting up the game takes away ~3.5GB. (When you enter a level the RAM usage rises to 6GB.) Why is this game hogging more RAM than even a modern AAA title?

- Family name, aka player file: the game, for some reasons, doesn't allow 1 character family names. This is already weird, but when creation fails, the UI has ABSOLUTELY NO FEEDBACK, it just silently fails.

- Entering a mission: ...Lmao? The game's using the EXACT AUDIO ASSET FROM PHARAOH for all mission narrations? (it is extremely noticeable because of the heavy audio compression from the original, and a constant background beat track accompanying the narration.) I didn't know you can cut cost by REUSING THE ORIGINAL'S ASSET directly on a remaster!

- In-mission main UI: Is the concept ""UI scaling"" this alien in 2023? The icons are small as hell on 1920x1080 screen, not to mention in bigger resolutions.
For a CITY BUILDER this game has no screen rotation and minimap? When the original have it? How does it occur to the devs that these two things can be not mandatory? I'm absolutely baffled.

- Icons: The buildings menu have undecipherable icons and inconsistent design. Why are some buildings on the first dropdown layer and some on the second?
It seems that the UI designer have no idea why every icon in Pharaoh inside a mission is put onto one side: so you have a consistent cursor flow doing everything. Now you have to move back and forth at two edges of the screen to do certain things.
Last but not least, who the hell decided Overseers and World Map should belong to the left, being SO SMALL? Most definitely a UI designer who never played the game, because every experienced player knows you need to check the Overseers menu EVERY 5 SECOND TO SEE IF THE GODS HAVE ENRAGED AT YOU. Or labor shortage. Or basically everything: Overseers button is THE MOST IMPORTANT SHORTCUT in the game. It should be made extra large.

- Building display: When you wish the main UI is bigger, they made it smaller. When you wish the building display is more concise, it becomes the most bloating crap I've ever seen. They managed to make the menu of a Bazaar 3x3 times bigger than the original!
And yet it doesn't have crucial information of HOW MANY STAFF IT NEEDS, HOW MANY STAFF IT HAS, and WHETHER LABOR IS STABLE FOR THE BUILDING!

- Map scrolling: When you press WASD to scroll and having the mouse move to the side, the mouse somehow takes precedence. Annnnd it's slower than the original too.

- Notifications: it's the laziest UI in video game history, period. It also misses the timestamp of each message in the list view, which is a LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY from the original.
Why EVERY TIME I build a new building that needs a job/isn't connected to a road it spawns another ""EMPLOYEES NEEDED""/""NO ROAD ACCESS"" notification? That's just unnecessary.

- Nilemeter: I'm not even sure if this visual Nilemeter that let's you see 12 months in advance is NOT misleading: Nile flood levels is intentionally made unpredictable (EVEN AFTER A PREDICTION) in the game for a good reason. It can just change prematurely; gods can change it too. So there is simply no way to display a value for the next Nile flood level without the caveat of it going to change some of the times.

- Game Speed: The maximum game speed is ONLY 5x? Do you realize how fast the fastest game speed in Pharaoh is? It'd be close to 10x-20x compared to this game. When you want to fast forward (it's a ""when"", not ""if"", because almost every single mid-game and late-game mission requires you to BUILD BIG MONUMENTS) it'll double or triple your time.

- Tutorials: They're HARD (aka forced) rather than SOFT (aka optional) in the original: if you don't finish the task specified to you (sometimes as trivial as ""Open the overlay menu on the left panel""), the game state do not progress. Apparently some players managed to get themselves softlocked by this.

- Graphics: Said ""HD-ified"" assets actually has much less detail than the original if you zoom in. This is particularly noticable on rocks and households.

- Music: The soundtrack of the original is godly for its expressive phrasing and musicality that treats meter and intonation as suggestions. Looking at the trailers, they didn't even find real musicians to perform the remaster's music? It's all electronically rendered by a transcribed music sheet? The remastered soundtrack is totally soulless, and this is painfully obvious even from the title theme (named THEME in original).

Anyways, this should be enough information for everyone wanting to try this game.

The game, play wise, is almost identical to the original by Impressions, its a true remake.
while i greatly prefer old school sprites in their aesthetic to this new ""modern"" soft and colorful art style that seems to have infected everything as if it was pushed on through art schools like a religion, i have to say the game is still quite pretty and does a great job imitating the old look of the sprites.

Constant popups about road block are annoying it creates no value to the gme so you know :)

Gameplay changes that I am unsure of (as a fan of the original):
1. Military: I am undecided on this. I loved the direct control and battle over the city in the original, but hated its janky implementation. This solution removes both - so it still nets out neutral as a feature to me.

I quickly became a master at it. After seeing there were relaunching it I was just so excited. I love that they brought this game back to life with new art and fixed some bugs. Since the existing game is so great its hard not to like this game, the art the music is great, the game is fun and engaging just like the original. 

A few things that need to be fixed:

one MAJOR change that I hate more than anything is the battle simulation way to take something that was not broken and make it soulless and meaningless. very disappointed. 

-Notifications must have a turn off switch they are so annoying this was an option in the original so it should not be hard to add back. 
-The organisation of the UI is confusing to me. I find myself clicking all over the place to find what I want. the OG Pharaoh made a lot of sense to me and it did not take up very much space on my screen. The new UI is very cumbersome and confusing. 
- Overseers I am very confused by the button layout and I miss the full screen statistic pages that we use to get in the OG so I can get a full grasp of my city. I find its not very clear what information I am looking at half the time. the workers overseer page is by far the most important page in dealing the worker priority levels and I have no idea how it works now.
-I Love that I can choose my own garden so glad you included that option in the game, but why cant I choose my own Plaza?
- The festival square is not working correctly as it does in the OG as it shows left over bits of road under it. The OG removed all road elements so that JUST the square is left. The OG allowed you to fill an entire square filled with road if you wanted and it would still let you place it. The new one wont let you do this.
-LOVE the global supply option
- I have a felling you will be launching this game on tablets and what not so maybe this is not important but i feel there is still charming aspects of the OG that are not really respected in this version. You had months to animate the opening movie from the OG. The opening movie in the OG is what really captured me as a kid and the fact you have left this out was a little disapointing.

So, to all the people who won't buy it because there isn't currently a mini map are either... well, never mind. Judging them is meaningless because, you know, internet ""culture"". Regardless, I never thought this game would get a remake and I am *forever* grateful for the amount of work and love that clearly went into this. 

Second of all, there are a lot of quality-of-life improvements. I don't have to run it through some weird launcher anymore to get it to work on a newer computer. The worker pathing is much improved. The ability to have jobs pull workers from the global map population and not just if houses are close enough - 10/10. The gameplay option menu is enough for me to recommend this game. Oh! You can also see where workers will enter and exit buildings! Great info when building.

Third of all, graphics are much smoother, the cheesy worker lines we all endearingly remember are still there, and the music is excellent. 

Now, all that being said, there is room for improvement:
1. A mini map would be nice - not mandatory, but nice. 
2. You can't rotate the map anymore, but I didn't even know you could do that in the original game until I had played it for about 15 years and finally watched some YouTube let's plays. So, that doesn't matter too much to me. Plus, you can press ""f"" and flatten all the buildings to still get a better view of where things are positioned. 
3. The menu that pops up when you hover over the palace? It disappears unless you pause the game or have it on a slower speed. It's kind of aggravating, but also not a deal breaker. 
4. Menuing could be a little smoother. I'm not sure how to explain why or how. It just feels clunky. 
5. More aspect ratios would be nice.

I haven't gotten there in the game, yet, but a lot of people aren't happy about the military mechanics. Which is another thing I don't really care about because I avoided military missions like a literal plague of locusts would attack me if I tried to play one.

Ultimately, I think many people are frustrated because we all have muscle memory attached to the original game. A lot of people seem to have a very close-minded idea of how the game ""is supposed to be"" rather than just allowing it to stand on its own while appreciating the nostalgia of it. If you love the original game and are willing to be a little frustrated when the hotkeys you've memorized don't work the same way anymore, then I would recommend it.

It runs great on the Deck, but there are two issues I’ve noticed that could easily make it great. 

1) The resolution. The game has very limited graphic settings and on the Deck it leaves black bars above and below the image. This wouldn’t be much of an issue, BUT when you want to use the mouse to go up or down on the map, you have to hover right at the top or bottom of the image to move it. If you go beyond the edge into the black bars, it won’t move. I wish you could scale it to the Deck resolution.

2) UI scaling. I’m surprised this isn’t a thing anyway. Of course the Deck is smaller, so the UI is smaller, but a lot of games have settings that allow for this now whether it’s console, PC, etc. if we could scale it up just a bit, it would be perfect.

Loaded up the pyramid sandbox and was like ""Hmmmm this maps big and I'm scrolling pretty slow. I'll fix that!"". Open up options... nothing...

I have seriously spent an extreme amount of time playing the original over the (many) years since it's release, and have been so looking forward to A New Era. A couple of issues with the game play, interface, campaign objectives would have been easy to overlook, but I only got 4 levels in before I decided that nostalgia alone was not enough for me to keep forcing my way through this game.

- Tutorial is maddening and unnecessary
- Game speed doesn't seem to go as high or low as original
- Can't increase game speed while placing building
- Holding + or - game speed key does not toggle through multiple speeds (gotta button mash to get all the way up and down)
- Can't seem to increase scroll speed for navigating map
- No map rotation or mini map
- Can't build a festival square over road configuration other than a simple intersection
- Overseer tabs are awkward to navigate and in a nonsensical order; unnecessary lack of text on icons, nor option to toggle (that I saw)
- Large info screens on building clicks feel clunky; comes up on left click rather than right click
- Objectives hard to track as game progresses and mission tab does not clearly show objectives?
- Houses which seemingly should evolve do not with appropriate food, entertainment access as expected
- Restart button should prompt “are you sure” or “would you like to save,” but does not
- No road hug in either direction of clicking (against buildings); if road selected is unviable (red) it will still build a road in the portion of blocks showing as green

Might have been nice to see plaza themes or colours, allowing the use of different colours for different parts of town or different housing communities; alternative statue and garden styles, building themes, diorama vs enclosed buildings, night mode; additional goods processing options (beer alternatives, different pottery skins, linen dyes, etc.) which could unlock bonuses for your population or are just rare and look special; additional industries like honey, bread, eggs, sweets, milk, onions, orchards, etc; alternate campaign option in addition to classic campaign.

I guess I was expecting A New Era to be what Stardew Valley is to Harvest Moon, but I was extremely disappointed. The game is missing the beauty (interface) and manoeuvrability of the original, but has added no additional features besides a slight graphics improvement to make up for these shortcomings.

I am so sad right now. I was so excited for years to play this game. Finally got to play it after I played the demo a while ago, and I found out they basically removed combat. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS.

Lethis team had one job to do, recreate the original, exactly how it is, with updated sound quality and graphics. That's it. A lift and shift. But they couldn't keep their hatred of combat away from this great game. They absolutely ruined it to some autoresolve screen where it autoplays meaningless battle and has meaningless results.

They absolutely ruined this game. If you like the previous game in its entirety, this game is not for you. Better to go get the originals. I don't even care about the graphics that much, but you shouldn't touch the mechanics!

Very disappointed, very sad. I gave my feedback during development, but they obviously didn't care about feedback. They just wanted to release their Lethis version of Pharaoh. Lethis is not, and never will be, as good as a Sierra game.

I'm going to add this thought, One of the absolute worst things in the original and sadly this, is how much of a black box the games systems are. For example, how much food does a farm produce? How many people does it support?

Or, how much does your clay pit produce, how many potters can it support and in turn how many people does that support? Who knows, the game sure won't bother to tell you. 

How's the appeal of this residential area, oh its purple. What does purple mean? In the original they at least used a column.

That being said I'm not terribly blown away by Pharaoh: A New Era.

It's good overall; new players will probably enjoy this more than veterans.

The game is missing a bit of the ""charm"" of the old Pharaoh. The music isn't bad but it isn't great either and maybe that's my nostalgia speaking but I definitely prefer the classic soundtrack more.

I'm really disappointed with the UI and the art style for the walkers. The walkers being ""cartoony"" isn't a deal breaker but it definitely didn't feel like an upgrade to the old but rather a different direction the team chose; which is perfectly fine but it's just not my taste.

The UI on the other hand is painfully bland and flavourless. It's just this vaguely mud/stone brown that doesn't really have any personality. I much prefer the hieroglyphic style of the classic UI.

The absolute BEST improvement for me has to be the addition of an optional global labour pool which makes city building so much cleaner and simpler rather than trying to corral walkers and labourers into the right places to fill employment.

Overall, its a good game, a good improvement on a classic (albeit with some design choices I didn't care for), its just not a great game.

Several hours into the game I have to say, I absolutely love it. There are a few things I like a lot better in this one, and some things that I preferred in the old. 

Pro:
- The new graphics are amazing! I absolutely love them. The style is a bit different (more vibrant colors, more stylized characters and buildings) but I think this works well for the game. 
- The gameplay mechanics were nicely improved. For example: buildings are opened almost instantly (if you have enough workers), distribution of goods and foods seems to work a lot smoother. 
- The tutorial missions were improved. Probably they are unnecessary for people who are familiar with the old game, but new players should be able to get into the game much more easily now. 
- The soundtrack: With the exception of the title theme, I love the new level soundtracks. They are not as repetitive as they were in the old game and work well as background music. 
- I love that they added the old voices for several languages (I tried German and English so far).

Con: 
- I really miss the old title theme, which was kind of catchy and the tune stayed with you. The new title theme feels like it is almost non-existent. 
- The UI at the start of the levels where it shows your level goals looks somewhat awkward and clunky. Visually, it reminds me more of a beta than a finished game version. I think centering the text would already make a difference. 
- For the same level goals screen, I kind of miss the old artworks which actually looked like a scroll.
- I did run into my first bug during the first 5 gaming hours where a level just wouldn't complete because despite having done everything right and used everything, the houses wouldn't upgrade to the required class, so I couldn't finish the level. I had to restart the level from scratch. 

Overall, I would say this is a nicely done remake and I will play it for a while. It could use some polishing here and there but most of that is visual and doesn't really affect the enjoyment of the game. Gameplay mechanics are solid. 

If you enjoyed the original game, you will definitely enjoy this one. (Be a bit patient getting used to the new UI though. That took a bit of getting used to. Once you do, it feels pretty intuitive.)

+ graphics
+ music

- the UI is not very intuitive (and it's advertised as a flag improvement). Changing everything to pictures doesn't really make it clear. There should have been some numbers left in (f.e. number of employees needed vs actual). 
- the advisors screens are a chore to open (I would suggest putting their buttons in line at the top of the screen) and the information is unclear due preference on images instead of numbers and text. 
- the pop up windows (f.e. the one that pops up when you hover over the population number) glitch very quickly into game and then they dissapear instantly after appearing
- the maximum speed of the game is unacceptable, I can't imagine how long it must take to go through missions that require building huge piramids at this speed. 
- I really enjoyed watching chains of workers pulling stones to piramids, this has now been taken away in favor of a single worker pulling a single stone :(
- the mechanic preventing migration seems to be not working fine as people are not coming in long after you improve the conditions|
- very limited number of resolutions. For me I had a black line at top and bottom of the screen and moving the screen by mouse was not working there.
- there is no minimap which seems the strangest decision so far. 
- the notifications are very aggresive and take a lot of screen space

For now I'm going to return the game. I'm hoping all the things are going to be improved but after looking at its current state I'm not going to keep it just with hope.

In overall, it's a very good remake of the original game from 1999. The developer changed things here and there when it comes to the UI. It may prove to be a little bit of a hassle for some people, nonetheless I wouldn't say it's a major flaw. More like a quirk of some sort that not everyone will endorse. To me, UI seems fine. The original felt a bit more ""Egyptish"" but other than that this one seems quite intuitive. In the end, it's the same Pharaoh. You build a city, organize its logistics and supply chains, while also playing around with puzzle-like structure of the game.

A great deal of work has been put into artworks and audio design. It's hard not to see the obvious reference to ""The Prince of Egypt"" movie, especially in the various backgrounds and the gorgeous cinematic. Music is frankly speaking enchanting.

Despite a big chunk of positives, Pharaoh: A New Era suffers from some flaws.
- Visuals, despite good-looking, aren't what it could've been, if more effort was put into it. Foliage has no wind animations. In other words: trees, tall grass, reed, garden foliage and farmland plants are represented by static bitmaps. There's no life in them. Desolate, barren land looks flat, waxy and uninteresting. There are no animations of sand swirling around the wasteland. Despite the fact that the developer added animated shadows of clouds, they didn't seem to bother much with clouds' reflections on the water surface. Same for the structures and ships. It's a small detail but collectively, it'd could have added a great value to the overall graphical fidelity of the game. As for the walkers – they're supposed to be big and cartoonish for the sake of practicality but perhaps it'd be a good choice to add a possibility to scale them from the main menu.
- Military has never been a strong part of Impressions Games, neither it is here in Pharaoh: A New Era. Many people have already pointed out that your city's topography makes no sense because in the end, battles are played on an entirely different map. I can see why they've introduced such a change but in the end it seems that it wasn't as good as it seemed initially.
- Lack of map editor, it's simple as that. 
- As of today, no official modding tools.
- No copy-paste interface.

I lived and breathed these games in the early 2000's. I booted this up today and instantly felt like I was back at the family PC in the kitchen in 99' working my way through Pharaoh's campaign for the umpteenth time. I've been following the development of this game from the start and was very happy with the passion the devs seemed to have for the original games. Even despite my trepidation about the UI changes they were iterating on I was very much looking forward to this. Sadly, too  much of the original games charm has been lost here.

Pharaoh: A New Era is the reason Steam needs a thumbs in the middle button. TLDR if you played the original games this likely isn't for you, if you want to experience Pharaoh for the first time without the hassle of getting it running on a modern system, this might be for you.  

The UI is completely different and dumbed down, gone are the stylized Egyptian overlays and button art, Those beautiful level selected and mission victory screens? Gone, replaced with a generic map. Oh the minimap? That's gone too. For some reason. Why is the mission victory audio dialog gone? Why on earth has the combat been relegated to a mobile game auto-battler?? That might just be the most egregious change of all.

The art style is of course subjective, there's quite a few complaints swirling around it and I can understand that point of view. The new art is more vivid leading to it looking a bit more cartoony than the OG's art if compared side by side. This didn't bother me as much as the myriad of other issues.

Positives :
Almost all of the art is a huge improvement

The UI is so much better than the old version, but it does take a good hour or so of play to get used to it and memorize what the pictures mean and where everything is located.  Everything in the game is much easier to do now and there are keybindings as well.  From setting game speed to checking overlays, everything is either customizable with a keybinding or accomplished through a UI element that is always displayed.

The music is much improved in my opinion, while still keeping most of its old charm,  It still sounds like Pharaoh to me.

Many optional game play settings such as having a population pool instead of depending on walkers.  No more putting random little huts inside of industrial areas!

Docks can now be edited a bit, like storage yards.

Negatives:
No more mini map... I cannot imagine why they would do this.  I get lost on even the basic campaign maps sometimes for a few seconds.

The art of the walkers/people on the map is hideous.  It looks like some weird mobile/facebook game or like the old Flash games.  Absolutely terrible and I cannot imagine why that was allowed to happen when the rest of the game is gorgeous.

Possibly positive or negative:
They moved combat out of the city so there is no more commanding your troops.  I hate that change and wish there were an option to include it, but I am sure many did not like the very clunky combat.

Overall, It basically is the same old Pharaoh with a much better UI, better graphics, no crashing, some desperately needed optional game play changes and... that is about it.  The cutscenes are updated (or removed...) too, but I have never really cared for those beyond the first time I played the game so they are fine even if they look kind of bland.  If you're expecting something new and exciting, this is not it.  If you love Pharaoh and want to play an improved version of it, that is exactly what this is.

I am hoping future updates give an option for the old-style combat.  There are also some strange problems with tool-tips not popping up like when mousing over the Palace.  The game is fully playable however even with that bug.

CONS:
-BAD UI, its really bad for those new designs of overseer, and not good enough as the old design with some fancy columns in the ""RATINGS OVERSEER"",
And such as the OVERSEER OF THE TEMPLES, you have to perform so many clicks to hold a festival, (in the old days we just have to right-click the square on ur screen), why making things so complicated comparing to the old games, stupid devs

-Stupid Overlay Hotkeys, why the fuck I have to set a key to close the overlays, just bring back the old default settings which u press the same key to deactivate the overlay, stupid new designs...

-Unnecessary animation in the menu, why the fuck I have the see those slow moving animations, it should not be existed

Bug found in the first campaign,
-If you remove the road before its telling you to place roadblock, you would be keep warning about no road accessing ur city and the only option you left is restarting the stage, well the first stage is just ~2mins but its fucking stupid for a remastered game, just let players place things wherever they want as the original game, don't force players place on the blue-tiles, stupid",1676491611,1676494319,False,8,1,0.498028188943862915,1,True,False,False

Instead, as long as the road from the houses is connected to the road to the pits, even if a roadblock is there, they are staffed. They can be far enough apart to not take be considered ugly. Oh, and cheat menu can be set to automatically already be there. Not played with that yet but it will be helpful as I plod along with this new version.

The houses still expand and shrink for the silliest reasons which is the main reason I hated this game. OMG, a juggler hasn't gone by in two hours! Shrink. Oh, neve rmind, there he goes. Expand.

This cough sound is so nostalgic, how I can talking about this game?  I remember buying those DEMO CDS and I only had 3 missions and no sandbox, but when you know started, I downloaded the full game and I played hours and hours non-stop and when I upgraded my PC I was sad I could not run the game, so when another platform said they will run this game with no  objections, I immediately bought it. I struggled because of the widescreen.  When steam re-issued again, I bought it as well! I had to search daily till I managed to play it.

When the developers announced they are remaking it, I JOINED their discord channel, putting it on wish-list and the amount of effort they did, I must say I am loving this game and I am amazingly enjoying it! the graphics, the smoothness, the new interface can be tricky but you will figure it out, this game is buy if you really loved the old one. Music could been better, but then the amount of hours you will spend is limitless.

Within half an hour of release I was playing the game hoping that it would be a modern update to classic Impressions titles.  First impression across the first half a dozen missions are positive. There are some awkward bits things such as win conditions not seeming to appear after the initial mission briefing, and the lack of rotate map seems an odd choice, but nothing that should deter you from buying this game. The character of these titles has been retained for example the humour in the hints and tips names etc. Hints and tips it also very good as 90s editions did a terrible job of actually explaining the mechanics.

If you want to play Pharaoh on a modern computer, this is it.

- Allow spaces in family name.
- Mini map please. Even if it's only just a top down camera in a new view instead of a real one.
- Needs more than only 16:9 aspect ratio resolutions.
- Game should pause while constructing by default or add an option if it needs to be possible to keep playing.
- Clicking buttons in the UI needs a sound effect.
- Info panel delay when hovering over buildings can be set from 1 to 3seconds. Add a 0 second option to that obviously.
- It is as the original where you first have to delete trees before you can build on them. But make it an option in the menu so that construction auto-deletes trees imo.

The only thing I don't fully like and that probably won't get fixed is that the basic speed feels faster than the originial.
It's only a little bit faster but enough that it loses some of that relaxed feeling Sierra city builders had. You can speed the game up when it's too slow but you can't speed it down aside from fully pausing.",1676481640,1676481864,True,167,4,0.869790852069854736,12,True,False,False

The campaign/tutorial is engaging enough to get a pass. The music is nearly on par with the original soundtrack except it doesn't feel like you're about to be sacrificed whenever you load up your city. The cutscenes are gorgeous as well as most of us expected from the trailer.

However, this game feels like it did the bare minimum it had to do with the property and a remake. The menus feel overly simplistic in some areas and too cluttered in others which is a trait I feel the original had. The sounds and graphics are lazy and at times remind me of a flash era game. Buildings can be placed really close together but the detection on them is buggy so you'll click the building next to the one you want or nothing will register at all. As faithful as it is to Pharaoh, as of right now it feels hollow and almost like a beta of what a modern Pharaoh game would look like.

This game is an example of how nearly 100% faithfully sticking to the source material sometimes is not the best option. The game should have been expanded on. Hopefully if we see a revival of the franchise they can build on what's already here.

I am an avid gamer of this genre and also a game designer and programmer. I would like to congratulate the developers.

BUT, and this is a big BUT, although they have made big bold claims about the music, the music is horrible. I can easily recognize that the instruments are Anatolian/Middle Eastern, they do not sound ancient Egyptian. Pharaoh's hypnotic effect is mostly about music. Why have you ruined the music?
