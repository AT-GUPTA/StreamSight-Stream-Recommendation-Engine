After spending more time in the game not playing with friends I would 100% not purchase if you are playing solo. 25% of the time you spend in this game is wasted with matches where either the killer or another survivor is afk/trolling. Add in the matchmaking being underwhelming and you only get a few good games here and there.

You go to killer and you choose skull merchant with knockout, bbq, grim embrace and uw with a rpd offering. You then find your first victim that give up after hearing your terror radius and slug them, after that you watch as their solo q teammates try to pick them up, but you place all your drones on this person and stalk from above as they desprately try to remove your drones. 

Some run straight into your drones with the intention to pick the slug up as fast as possible, getting deep wounded while doing so and being swiftly downed, others try to hide at the sides but with UW you make them scream and fill their bodies with dread. From around the corner one of them hides and you stalk your undetectable body to them. You round the corner and make them scream from terror as you shove your blade into them. The two other slugs try to crawl away towards the non chased person but you realize what they are doing and with your UW cooldown being gone you swiftly open a locker and hear the person scream and you damage them too. You turn around and see the person you chased before trying to sneak back to recover their teammates and you down them too. 

One person left and you hear a disconnect. Your first slug cant be bothered anymore and you smile knowing not only your games have been bad. Opening a locker for the last time you hear the person scream, slowly but surely you stalk your way to them placing a drone to become undetectable. You smile to yourself, this time im the one bleeding people out instead of being bled out. This time i am the one causing the pain instead of experiencing it. THIS TIME. i win. I WIN THIS TIME.

you see them standing infront of a hook, they have given up. You go to them as you hear your bot slug bleed out and die, the second one only some seconds behind from experiencing the same fate. 

You smile to yourself as you down the person, crows being heard from your second slug as they too have given up long ago. 

The survivors then expected you to hook them, but you dont.

You instead stand up from your chair your job being done and go do something else. As you take off your headphones you see the third slug realize whats about to happen and a disconnect sound is heard. The second slug bleeding out as well.

Your fourth slug with pain in their eyes looks up at you quietly begging to be hooked. This is will be their fourth disconnect and they dont want to wait an hour to play, but you laugh to yourself and turn around from the computer, the third slug bleeds out and the fourth slug hears the hatch spawn in the middle.

You arent there to witness it, but you can feel it inside of you as the last slug try desprately crawling to the hatch, their time is almost up. 3 metres, 2 metres, their hand reach up to the sky begging for mercy, begging for only some seconds more to reach escape. But its futile, their hand falls down and so do their face too. All four survivors have bled out.

You come back to your computer after 3 minutes and read an endgame chat that could only be described as hell itself.

With all your anger being taken out of you, you quit to the lobby and press survivor, not knowing what awaits you.",1708544590,1708826738,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In recent months developers are making the game worse and worse.

Releasing bad DLCs with terrible concepts, design and execution of DLC in general.
Skull merchant, xenomorph are only some of terrible killers.
Nurse is still not being dealt with, extremely overpowered killer. People saying things like ""she is fair because it takes time to learn"" are ridiculous, something that takes time to learn must be strong, not overpowered, and nurse is overpowered, the are hundreds of possible scenarios where you cannot do anything against her.

Developers are nerfing balanced perks because a lot of people use them, they are making these perks absolutely unusable.
I might agree that deadhard was quite boring, because perks that make you outwait something are not really fun, but it was balanced, now it is unusable.

Suffice to mention the huge amount of unfair and OP perks developers decided not to to nerf (because who would nerf unbalanced perks when you can completely ruin balanced ones), does not matter what anyone says, both sides have plenty of them.

Ridiculous bugs, terrible (ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING) htiboxes, all present in the game.

Reworking bad map and make it good? No. 
Rework bad map without fixing the reason why it is bad? Yes.

Why would developers rework good maps and make them complete trash?
No idea, but it is what is happening to the game.
Macmilan, coldwind, bargo and many others, why?

Seems like they are trying to make the game work and make you forget about all the problems by adding tons of skins no matter whether it is big content update or small patch.
Also, skins that are being released fit ""really great"" in the game.
We are developing horror game, what skin should we add for clown killer to make people feel like they are playing a horror?
Pink elephant is the way to go!
KPOP star killer that looks goofy rather than scary and make neon skins for him, cool.
I agree that DBD is not scary no matter what after first 10 games, but if the game has its own atmosphere, everything needs to be done sticking to it.

Huge amount of problems in the game and insufficient solutions by devs.
Camping, how did they try to fix this?
By creating bar that after filling lets you unhook yourself, sounds cool?
Yes, but it fills only if killer is face-camping you, if he is a little bit further from that small range it will not help.
Proxy camping is 95% of camping and this problem is not solved by this.

Not being able to fix something without completely disabling it from the game is great.
Remember when they had to remove cenobite, clown, wesker for a few weeks before they managed to rework them.
What made devs disable them and not just let it be while reworking them?
Who knows.

I would say even though it's easier now, trying to get characters or perks can be quite time consuming, and by the time you get there, you might already get tired of the game, cuz theres always gonna be a new DLC to catch up to.

Main Issues:
Survivor gameplay can get stale quickly, especially when facing repeat killers or getting repeat maps, and there is not maybe unique and fun survivor perks to combat this, (considering survivors don't have unique abilities like killers, but I don't think they should). Since the (necessary) Dead Hard change (from the dash), (necessary) nerfs to boons, and not many unique and good perk ideas (with some exceptions), has also added to the staleness factor.

The survivor objective has gotten rather stale, but this can be aided by the fact that they are now experimenting with new game-modes.

One of the other big issues is perks (on both sides), most perks seem rather weak (needing buffs) compared to meta/good perks, and many perks are rather boring (even the meta ones). I think they have also lost some of the interesting gameplay incentives they've had when the removed bloodpoint bonuses from perks.

Obtaining perks is also still an issue as well, while it's been made ""easier/faster"" in recent years, there is still issues for casual players to get perks they would want, and it can still be overwhelming with the amount of perks and characters now. The main problems being the shrine and lack of variety for general perks. For example when trying to play with more casual friends on survivor, they usually lack perks they would need/want to make the game more fun/enjoyable. I also think there should be some kind of ""welcome back"" bonus (that wouldn't be better than just playing) for casual players.

it doesn't feel particularly rewarding for playing more frequently (besides leveling goals) with daily rituals system being very limited and the grades/ranks are not really that easy to to get through, since it's sorta based on your skill/performance so they can be a bit frustrating. Tome challenges are fine, but I don't think it's enough to feel rewarded anymore.

it is also hard to tell what your next match is gonna be like (because you can't see your matchmaking rank score) so you might have a fun match or a really frustrating one and there's no way to prep for it well and adapt (even mentally).",1708816124,1708816416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is so unbalanced now in favor of killers. I have played killer from time to time, but I consider myself a survivor main. This game's been slowing changing towards that overtime, but now it’s at a point where it’s just not fun to play as a survivor anymore.

Most of the time, killers camp the hook or tunnel the same survivor and then they end up disconnecting or killing them-self on the hook. And while the devs brought a ""system"" that's supposed to help with this, it doesn't. You get yourself off the hook only if they're basically standing in your face. Then, assuming you do get off the hook, they just chase you down until your endurance timer runs out and kill you. So, doesn't FIX anything. Killers, being so overpowered, still continue to play try-hard despite the imbalance and there are more buffs coming to killers in a recent development update. I really don't understand.

There have been many times during the games life where the devs nerf survivor perks, but the most recent perk nerfs really hurt the game. The aura reading has also gotten out of hand and you can’t really hide from killers anymore, even when using perks like distortion that hide you from some of the aura seeing perks. 

I’m just about at the point where I’m ready to uninstall this game because it’s clear that this game is very killer preferred and not fun for survivors anymore. It’s sad because of how many hours and money I’ve invested in them over they many years. So, I don’t recommend this game as I would’ve years ago.

The asymmetrical horror genre, with its blend of survival and killer gameplay, has kept me hooked for hours on end. (No pun intended)  However, I can't help but feel a sense of exclusion as a straight player when it comes to the game's cosmetic choices.

One of the game's charming features is the variety of cosmetic items, including charms that allow players to personalize their characters. Dead by Daylight has admirably embraced diversity and inclusivity, evident in the availability of Pride charms representing different sexual orientations. While this is a commendable step towards creating a welcoming atmosphere for all players, it seems there is a missed opportunity to extend this inclusivity to the straight community.

As a straight person, I can't help but notice the absence of a charm representing the straight flag or heterosexuality in general. The game's commitment to recognizing and celebrating various sexual orientations should ideally extend to all players, regardless of their sexual identity. Including a straight flag charm would not only provide a more comprehensive representation but also reinforce the game's commitment to inclusivity.

It's important to note that advocating for inclusivity is not about diminishing the significance of any group but rather ensuring that everyone feels acknowledged and accepted. Dead by Daylight has taken commendable steps in this direction, but expanding the range of charms to include the straight flag would make the game's cosmetic offerings truly representative of its diverse player base.

In conclusion, while Dead by Daylight has successfully fostered an environment that embraces diversity, there is an opportunity to further enhance inclusivity by introducing a straight flag charm. This small addition would go a long way in making all players feel seen and valued within the Dead by Daylight community.",1708804029,1708804029,False,0,1,0.434782594442367554,3,True,False,False

They have started to make the game better and maybe in the future it will be good, but I cannot recommend this game in its current state. Getting to high ranks is a hollow experience as is most of Dead by Daylight. There are definitely fun and exhilarating moments, but they are washed away with all the garbage in the end. Even the atrocious rubber banding is still in the game.

As a positive note, the classic characters from other franchises are fantastic! They do make me wish they had their own modern games, however.

First off, let's talk about the concept. It's brilliant. You've got a group of survivors trying to escape a nightmarish killer, all while trying to repair generators to open the exit gates. The tension is palpable as you try to stay hidden, avoid the killer's gaze, and coordinate with your teammates to make your escape.

And speaking of killers, the variety is insane. From classic horror icons like Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger to original killers with their own twisted backstories, there's something for every horror fan. Each killer has their own unique abilities and playstyle, keeping every match fresh and unpredictable.

But it's not just about surviving. Playing as the killer is a whole other thrill ride. Stalking your prey, setting traps, and unleashing your terrifying powers on unsuspecting survivors is an absolute blast. And let me tell you, nothing beats that rush of adrenaline when you finally catch your target.

The gameplay itself is smooth and polished, with intuitive controls and stunning visuals that really immerse you in the horror-filled world. And with regular updates and new content being added all the time, there's always something new to discover and explore.

Overall, ""Dead by Daylight"" is a masterpiece of horror gaming. It's intense, it's addictive, and it's guaranteed to keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of horror or multiplayer games, do yourself a favor and give this one a try. Trust me, you won't regret it.",1642375833,1708734217,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Other will refer to it as a broken, unbalanced mess of spaghetti code. 
Here's the thing: neither viewpoint is wrong.

Objectively speaking, understanding this game is a long journey. It will demand many hours from you. I've sunk 1.2k hours into this game, and there's still a lot I don't understand; how to loop efficiently, how to hug walls tightly without thinking, even hitting Great Skill Checks with any consistency is a challenge unless I'm using a perk build centred around doing it.

However, if you're the kind of person who doesn't have time to learn each of the game's mechanics, this can still be a game for you. This is still a game that you can play casually, without wanting to win every game.

Dead by Daylight is a game with a repetitive gameplay loop, a playerbase as likely to type ""unalive yourself"" in the endgame chat as the average MOBA fanbase, and it's likely going to remain completely impossible to properly balance, to boot. 

And yet, I can't bring myself not to recommend it, because when you put the time into understanding what you need to, it's a fun game. 
For Survivor, that fun could come from looping a Killer so well they leave you and go for someone else, or getting a 4-man escape against all odds. 
For Killer, it could come from hitting a seemingly impossible shot as a ranged Killer, or getting your first 4-kill.
For either , it could come from just using the stupidest, most meme-centric build, and somehow still winning a match.

If you decide to try it out, I'll see you in the Fog. 
If not, no problem.

(Bonus: Go to the store and type ""WARRIORPUPPERS"" in the ""redeem code"" section. It'll give you a cosmetic charm that was made as a tribute to a DBD player who passed away from ALS. RIP Max.)",1708723556,1708723757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Though you may hear different, this game has a massive cult-like following with consistent gaslighting. The objective speed for survivors is significantly faster than objective speed for killers (on average 50% of their objective complete vs 8.3% for the killer) which leaves alot to be desired at top MMR gameplay. If you are competitive you will be in for a rude awakening when you find out the game isn't balanced towards the top players, its balanced towards the mid-tier players. This makes certain perks and add-ons for survivors HEAVILY abusable, and the better you get at the game the more vast this gap becomes. It has an amazing concept but unfortunately, the lack of proper balancing turns this game into a dopamine trip for bad players that want to flex and belittle killers. 

BE WARNED: It is a  fun game for survivor; you are in complete control and can bully the killer which makes alot of bad players seem better than they are.

It is TERRIBLE for killer because no matter what you do you are demonized in the community and you will be hit with constant nerfs which make no sense at all.

Balancing can be all over the place but that's fine and to be expected from a game that is essentially just a party game with aspirations for a potential competitive future. 

It's unfortunately the community that ruins the game in the end. I met so many fun and lovable people on this game who I still consider some of my closest friends to this day, but those are few and far between. Most games will have either side (Killer or Survivor) be toxic to the other or both sides decide they want to just be jackasses to each other at the same time. It's so common. I used to have a group of like 10 people, where we would all rotate and play this game together, loving the time we all had with each other. But the more we played, the more the game drained us.

None of us play anymore. The toxicity, the sweaty attitude of like 80 % of the people you'll run into on either side, is just too much for a game like this, that can so easily go to a horrible experience for a person. While chatting isn't an option, the in game behavior is more than capable of being disruptive. As someone who's played League of Legends since 2010, this game's grieving methods have frustrated me far more than that game. 

Give it a shot. If you got excited by seeing a licensed character you love in this game, that's understandable. That's the point. Play it for a bit, see if it's for you. But if you end up feeling like somethings off, like you feel wronged, or grossed out by what you experienced through the gameplay, that's valid. On both sides. Both teams have equal opportunity to be dicks. 

Just be kind to each other guys.

It is not a ""party game"" anymore and most (if not all) fun elements of the game have been removed. This game is nothing compared to how it was in 2021 and before, it is unfortunately boring af now. The game has the most toxic and horrible communities you will ever come across. Entitled killers/survivors everywhere that you send you death threats if you don't follow their rules and play how they want you to.

For 3 years the developers have been prioritizing balancing over how fun the game at it's core is, from removing fun techs, adding new killers with copy paste powers from older killers (or just adding anti-loop snooze killers), patching harmless things like killers flying by adding invisible walls literally everywhere, nerfing survivors into the ground constantly, ""balancing"" maps (wtf) and adding clutter/trash everywhere, encouraging competitive playstyles and boring strategies, etc. This game has no real fun to it anymore, unless you want to play like you're in a tournament every match going against the same 3-4 killers with the same gen slowdown builds. This game is not what it used to be and the ""Mostly Positive"" reviews you see on this game is misleading and are reviews from a time where the game was great (<2021).",1670017806,1708636860,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It doesn't matter if you've spent 10 thousand hours in the game or just 10. The balance is ruined, the mechanics are chaotic or completely devoid of logic - it's pure RNG. People find pleasure in ruining others' fun through ''camping'' or ''tunneling''.

The in-game chat is censored, supposedly to prevent toxic behavior; as a result, the game can censor words like ""killer,"" ""murder"" (in a game of this theme), and sometimes even simple ""gg"" (good game). What amused me the most was the censorship of my question asking if my teammate is Polish. It's a shame, ""Behaviour"" prides itself on its tolerance for everyone, yet they decide for you what you can and cannot say.

I once spent many enjoyable moments with friends in this game, but unfortunately, Dead by Daylight has been heading towards the abyss for a while now, like a speeding train, and it doesn't seem to have any intention of stopping, quite the opposite. They prefer releasing new skins or building hype around characters not native to the game, such as Ada Wong, Alan Wake, Ellen Ripley & Xenomorph, Demogorgon from the ""Stranger Things"" series, among many others.

If developers pay more attention to the lower part of the queen xenomorphs' backs than to fixing and enriching the game, it speaks for itself.

While its balance could REALLY use some changes, the game offers a large variety of playstyles, having several Killers, including icons like Myers or Leatherface to choose from, even Chucky. 

Each character comes with their own 3 unique perks, which later on can be used on the other characters, this allows to change how you play the game, from being a stealthy survivor, to one centered around teamwork for example. 

The game unfortunately can be a bit overwhelming for newcomers due to the large amount of DLCs with content locked behind them, including the perks, some often being among the best.

The game while not free of bugs, runs smoothly for the most part, i rarely run into issues. 

The atmosphere of the game is also good, like mentioned earlier, each match can be a different experience since theres a large roster of killers, and each survivor can bring their own tricks to the field, so you have to be ready for whats coming. 

For those likely wondering, the matches are essentially a 4v1, 4 survivors and 1 killer, the survivors have to repair 5 Generators to power up the Exit Gates and escape the trial, the Killer on the other hand, has to protect said generators and find the survivors, down them, and hook them to be able to sacrifice them.

Thats pretty much it on a nutshell.

While the game can be fun, its hard to recommend to a newcomer due to all the progression needed to get even with an active player, plus having to buy all the DLCs

at least that was my opinion back then, now i would recommend this game on the simple account that the developers have shown that they do care about the gameplay, there is still much to be done with for example toxicity and reporting people but i think they have started doing pretty darn good. still gotta exit the lobby after game quickly to not get told to kms for slugging and camping last gen...

nah i gotta add again, reinstalled it after a long time now to see if its gotten any better at all, i play 5 games, my first one goes good, no toxic people no bs, no tbagging nothing, a normal fun match, my second games goes with minor tbagging but no toxic postgame so its fine, my third game goes against 2 prestige 100 players in a 4man squad with flashlights, sabotage boxes and plenty of postgame toxisity even when i did 3k them, my 4th match goes horribly because the game decides that i should be matched against another 4man squad that do nothing but rush gens, hide and leave with plenty of staying in the exit gate to tbag, my 5th match i for some reason have to make do with 20 fps because the game decided it was time to learn why i left again, no postgame toxisity but plenty of bugs, a leon i was chasing SHOULD have gotten hit by my ds ranged attack.... SHOULD, because he was in the middle of the open and suddenly teleported around the corner infront of him, or that time when i hit him dead on while he vaulted a window and just ran away, not hit by it at all, or when i hit a cheryl, and the game just decided that i should be teleported forward to hit the dumpster behind her instead........ game so trash it takes you to it


bro i cant believe i tried it again, ONE GAME, i play deathslinger and DS power completely breaks survivor models making survivors completely invisible, fuck this game and fuck these lazy POS devs

[i]Well, I'll comment on a few things to make it clear. I hope that with this analysis, people will understand what they can expect by joining the game.[/i] 

[i]Well, let's start by talking about the game's survivors.[/i]

[i]The game has several survivors, but they all have practically the same mechanics, which in this case is nothing more than running away, but it's not just running away, you can use things to delay the killer, make the killer lose time and give your partners time to do the survivor's objectives.[/i]

[b]What are the survivors' objectives in the match?[/b]

[i]The survivors' main task is to repair the generators so that they can escape the nightmare. Once they have repaired at least 5 generators scattered around the map, you will power up the map's exit gates, so you must go to the gate that has already been powered up, pull the lever, wait a while and open the gate so that all the survivors can escape.[/i]

[i]During this time you will have Killer, who will do everything to stop this process.[/i]

[b]What is Killer's objective in the match?[/b] 

[i]That's simple, stop the survivors from turning on the generators, knock the survivors down and put them on hooks so that they die over time, and of course, kill the survivors and keep them from escaping.[/i]

[i]The mechanics of the match work as follows. The survivors make the generators, some of the survivors spread out to make the Killer waste his time while his partners make the generators, and the Killer will follow these survivors, give them two attacks, knock them down and hook them. But you ask me, once they're on the hook, is it over? No, when the survivors are put on the hook, they need to be saved by the other survivors in the match. While the survivor is on the hook, he will lose life over time, but as far as I can tell, the life the survivor has on the hook is separate from the life he has off the hook. To put it simply, if the survivor is on the hook for the first time, his life on the hook will be at maximum, the second time on the hook it will be at half and the third time he will die.[/i]

[i]Now let's talk a bit about the killers in the game. This game has different Killers, each with their own skill and way of playing, as well as some that are taller and shorter, with a larger or smaller terror radius, as well as more speed when walking and less speed. The standard for those with 4.6M/s is to have a terror radius of 32 meters, but there are exceptions within the game, such as the famous Killer Michael Myers, who has a speed of 4.6 M/s, but his terror radius is 6 meters, quite short.[/i]

[i]The game also has Killers whose movement speed is 4.4M/s. These Killers in particular can be of medium or low height, as well as having a terror radius of 20 meters. These types of Killers are very different, but they are more difficult to play as they are slower than the survivor. You'll have to use your brain as much as possible to make good moves with these slower Killers. One of the most famous examples of Dead by Daylight is the Huntress. She's tall, has a medium terror radius and is slow compared to the other Killers, but she does have a long-distance ability. She can throw hatchets almost infinitely far, just use your head and you'll be able to make good moves. But there's a catch in the game, there's no crosshair in the middle of the screen showing you where to aim and ""shoot"", you'll have to learn that by playing, which means she's an intermediate/difficult Killer[/i]

[i]There are also those Killers who have more complex abilities that require a little more training time to master in-game, such as the Nurse who has the ability to teleport short and long distances, and can also go up and down floors, as well as pass through walls, but she is a Killer who, after using teleportation, gets fatigued for a short time. In her first teleport (1/2 charge), the fatigue is less compared to her second teleport (2/2 charge).[/i]

[i]There are also famous Killers from old movies like Freddy Krueger, PinHead and famous horror games like Nemesis (RE), PyramidHead (SilentHill), among others. Each with their own abilities, heights and terror rays.[/i]",1632787952,1708573516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Aside from a few outdated mentions of ""upcoming"" or ""future"" content, the rest of the review still reflects my opinion on the current state of the game, and thus won't be adjusted.[/h1]

[b]With the upcoming DLC being forced out prematurely, Behaviour Interactive (BHVR) have made it abundantly clear that community feedback, quality gameplay, and a satisfactory user experience all come second to routinely grabbing at our wallets.[/b]

For context, every year there are a total of 4 DLC's released, usually consisting of a new Killer, new Survivor, and ~50% of the time, a new map too. This 3 month development period between DLC's has consistently proven itself to be detrimental to the game's health, resulting in fundamentally broken and mismanaged content, and nowhere near enough time for the [i]unbelievably[/i] incompetent dev team to fix issues to any satisfactory degree, let alone take community feedback into account. Every new release breaks the game a little (or a lot) more, sometimes on such deeply integrated mechanical levels that it renders the game nearly unplayable for one or both of the game's roles. 
[b]Killers, perks, maps, and audio are just 4 of the extremely important elements of the game that are routinely broken and left unpatched for anywhere between days and months at a time.[/b] And just to be clear, I mean ""broken"" in the true, ""This is not functioning as it should be,"" sense, not just little bugs that lead to funny moments.

[b][u]The upcoming DLC, ""A Binding of Kin"", is the first paid(!) DLC to be released with a log of bug fixes the content will be receiving in future patches. BHVR is selling an unfinished product with the full price tag, just so they can maintain their 4 paid DLC's per year quota.[/u][/b]

This is completely unacceptable. This company has repeatedly shown utter contempt for their community, and simply do not deserve the passionate fanbase they've somehow amassed. 

As someone who has wasted far too many hours, and dollars, on this game, I will not give BHVR one more cent until there are serious amendments made to the way this company treats its content, and its community. I strongly urge you to take a similar stance.

Perks which are used to counter toxic behaviour are locked and spread between multiple DLCs, some original (which can now thankfully be acquired relatively quickly thanks to the new Prestige system), and some licensed which can only be bought with money or getting lucky on the Shrine of Secrets. Furthermore, despite some of the newer killers being flawed (Chucky being able to traverse the map quickly by never breaking pallets, buggy Xenomorph tentacle etc), most of the balance patches and reworks BHVR has done within the last year or two have been great!

There is still the issue of many killers ignoring pallets and the fact that for a killer to be good these days they have to come with a teleport/roaming ability, but survivors do have access to some pretty good perks to help them in chase

Problematic killers and play-styles (3 genning, camping, tunneling, holding W as survivor and the Skull Merchant) are slowly being addressed, but most of the effective counterplay is still locked behind DLC

New balance patches and QoL improvements are still being pushed out, and DBD is looking better and better as time passes by. I will however say that the latest event gamemode, that being Lights Out, was an unbalanced nightmare that did not retain my engagement for longer than 3 matches before it became miserable to play. Also, SBMM still sucks, and has recently gotten worse for those who are good enough to be in high MMR but don't want to sweat it out every game

TLDR: Game has slowly improved since my last review, but still has a high barrier to entry that makes soloQ miserable without certain DLCs and fundemental understanding of game mechanics. Worth a buy these days, but only if you're looking to invest significant time outside of the game to understand the gameplay loop and mechanics",1634662575,1708538139,True,0,0,0.636512577533721924,0,True,False,False

I lost a lot of games because of this, I kept the killer for maybe 3/4 generators, and then in the throes of crying because he's too poor, he stops to look at me on the hook.

Additionally, the game's reliance on microtransactions for cosmetic items and certain characters may alienate some players, detracting from the overall enjoyment of the experience.

In summary, ""Dead by Daylight"" is a tour de force in multiplayer horror gaming, offering a pulse-pounding experience that is as exhilarating as it is immersive. With its innovative gameplay, deep strategic depth, and thriving community, the game stands as a testament to the power of interactive entertainment to captivate and thrill audiences. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the genre, ""Dead by Daylight"" promises endless hours of heart-stopping action and unforgettable moments, making it a must-play title for any gaming enthusiast.",1705250956,1708434070,True,279,8,0.774405419826507568,0,True,False,False

Quitting DbD has gotten me into a relationship and succeed in life. You can do it, just quit, you cant ween off. Cold Turkey quit. Might play again if Stranger Things returns.

[Update as of 11/18/22]
The game has improved, cheating is still an issue but most of the matchmaking problems are fixed. BHVR is doing better, hopefully not just for now. I don't play, I cant find it in myself to after my bad experience with the game. Balance issues like all of Nurse are still things that hold the game back, and there have been some questionable moves made. I will still keep this a negative, but if you are interested get it when its on sale and give it a good college try. I'll start playing more if Stranger Things returns.



[Original]
I genuinely cant suggest buying or playing this game after MMR was introduced, it is litteraly the main reason why I left this game, I know I dont have many hours but almost every one of them was pre MMR and after it was introduced every game session follows this pattern. I play a match for the first time in months, I get placed with a dog ass killer and try my best to not dominate but still do, but the next game is a top rank killer who kills me before 4 gens. This pattern also goes for killer as well, I have my thoughts about the game outside of MMR like an intense hate for Trickster and the massive cheating problem but that doesnt really bother me that much. MMR ruined DbD, and I will keep it uninstalled until they revert the MMR, which will be never (they said so).

Game companies that chose to not retain their original playerbase from day 1 often struggle very badly because OG fandom is what pays the bills. If they would have stuck with the original game's format this company would have made BILLIONS of dollars quarterly and would have sliced out more than 25% of the gaming industry's playerbase just to this game alone.

A killer will target the weakest link in a group. I promise if you're hard to catch you won't be focused on. If you continue to slip up you're going to get eliminated from the match pretty quick.

People rage quit in this game quite often luckily this game has a pretty steep penalty for those that make it a habit. The timer will continuously increase the more you do it so if you rage quit three times then your net goes down which isn't your fault you might have a 1-3 hour timeout. So don't rage quit.

But the community is very toxic and it doesn't seem like the developers really care about the communities concerns. For a long time it seemed like they were covering things up instead of correcting issues. There is a ranking system, but it's trash. You could be the lowest rank (20), and get paired with a high red rank (4 -1). The players themselves are entitled. No matter what they refuse to be wrong so it seems like you're talking to a wall. The amount of times I've been told to off myself is insane. The killers and survivors both complainers who fight for their own side. All around this game is broken. It has many glitches and flaws. Addicted, but if I knew this before hand I wouldn't have gotten the game.

Yikes. This new update changes the review. It's even worse now. At least before if you did okay you would progress. This new update even when you do decent and what's called ""safety pip"" you still lose a token to your rank if you die. This game was horrible before. It's even worse now. Graphics are cool. Nice new touch. Maps look very spooky, but the game itself is broken. Honestly considering dropping it and never touching it again at this point. (02/09/21)

Edit: How many killers have been complaining? I came back to see if the game got any better, but who am I kidding? Most of the survivor perks have been nerffed and most of the killer perks have been buffed. It's become more unfair than when I left. Don't think I'm a survivor main because I'm not. I play both sides equally. Survivor with friends and killer when friends are offline. I can tell playing killer is so much easier even though both are in the same general rank. I do love these ban timers though. They don't do anything.  News flash most people play more than one game. If we get a ban timer it's a vacation from an unfair playing field. Not a waiting game. I have over 300 games between all platforms. Trust me I'm happier with a ban timer. (02/19/24)",1589772312,1708376684,False,1,0,0.492642343044281006,0,True,False,False

I love the customization options and all of the wonderful killer crossovers as well as their original creations! Really great stuff.

On the other hand, they are constantly changing survivor perks and how they work due to killer mains complaining. It is a 4v1 game, instead of changing what they have already released, why not add counter perks instead? Stop changing Perks every few months and then wondering why the community is annoyed and upset. 

It's a fun challenge creating the right build for your play style, but at this point, they've changed so much I don't even get to be creative with the builds anymore. I just have to use what few perks(most of which have been nerf'd beyond belief) I can to survive all of the tunneling and camping killers. 

I've lost count of the amount of games that I've played where the killer tunnels out each survivor because ""It's the only way to win"" for them. There is no point in playing as a survivor if you get tunneled out before your team is even able to get one Gen done.  

On the incredibly rare occasion that I have come across a killer that doesn't tunnel/camp, it's an incredibly fun game! Most of the time they still get a 4k and I'm not even mad because the challenge was fun!

It has gotten to the point that even the Killer mains are creating videos showing how impossible it is to go against them using certain perks.

i mosty played survive games but lately i mostly play killer because i no longer have fun solo q with survive and doing gens is actaully boring to me, but people will force you to become toxic and try hard and play in specific way ,i  had killer games that was 5 min long because people gen rush to infinity and beyond speed ( like how you enjoy doing gens to only escape , like pressing one bottom is gaming and having fun for you? and you tell me this people have a healthy brain and not mentally ill?!) i remember i was and still am an average surv and the killer who was playing a spirit tunnel me on 5 gens , after the match he told me thats this is how high mmr plays , i was like dude if this is high mmr what im doing here with 300 hours  , you are not high mmr you have ego because you are real life loser.
yes there are killers who shouldn't be in this game like nurse ,singularity , but most killer are fine , some need huge buff like myres but the game would be so balanced and fun if people werent this win hungry
if this game had a good community , you wouldn't care about balancing killers , gen speed , perks and more , but sadly is this not you will face while playing this game , i even look forward to go against bully squads when i play killer because they mostly dont care about winning and doing gens , instead they fight the killer , i would say if you have 4 friends buy this game , so you can play withe them , ,killers are fun too but if you dont go against  sweat lords who have no life

The game is inherently unbalanced both ways because of the fact to counter certain perks more effectively, you have to use certain perks, but you only have 4 slots, so some games ur perks do a ton and other games they do nothing at all.

[b]TL;DR[/b] Fun game for a while. Unfortunately plagued by greedy microtransactions, obvious imbalances, and some clunky mechanics.

Was peer pressured into buying this game, and we've played intermittently for years, especially when Halloween comes around. However, after playing some on my own and really seeing what the game has to offer, I cannot recommend the game as a whole.

Don't get me wrong - I have a lot of hours in the game, almost entirely as a survivor, and have generally enjoyed most of them. But this has been a trickle of hours over the years, during which I've only seen the game continue to double down on my complaints.

[b]The good[/b]

This game does a lot of things well. The general pace of the game is nice, and it's clear the concept was well thought out. Gameplay [i]usually[/i] feels smooth enough, and the game is graphically pleasing. I love the feeling of dread and while repairing generators and hearing the terror music get louder, shortly followed by a panicked decision making process on whether to hide or run.

My favorite thing from this game is that almost all your bloodpoints, used for level progression, are based on your personal performance rather than wins/losses. Sure, you can get unlucky in a game and die pretty quickly, but its easy to just hop in another and try again. Overall, concept is cool and there is lots of potential.

However...

[b]The bad[/b]

First and foremost, the He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named of PC gaming, [b]microtransactions[/b]. And I mean [b]a LOT[/b]. You should not release a game where literally 3/4 of the released characters cannot be unlocked without spending more money on a, excuse the emphasis, [b]PAID!!!![/b] game. Since I've started playing over the past few years, they have not released a [i]single[/i] new free survivor or killer. This is obviously a money grab, emphasized more with the incredible imbalance of some paid features, primarily killers & their perks.

Aside from greed and lack of care, the game just feels repetitive after a while. Short of the (admittedly, quite cool) collaborations providing lots of new maps to see, the gameplay loop doesn't really change. Perhaps the most interesting part of the game is building out your survivor/killer and trying new tactics, but when most of the options are behind a paywall, that kind of defeats the purpose. And in the same vein, leveling up & getting what you need is a bit of a grind, so it'll take a while before you even get any meaningful options for your build.

The game feel for me is [i]fine[/i], but a bit awkward. Movement can be wonky, and hitboxes on survivors are super strange at time. You'll find a lot of situations where the game is clearly favoring the killer.

Also, lobbies take a little while to find as survivors, but are [i]near impossible[/i] to find as the killer. So if being a killer is what excites you most, just go in expecting 7 minute breaks between each of your games while you wait to find a match. But to be fair, this might ease up as your killer rank improves, and I haven't given this a real good shot again in a few years.

[b]In conclusion...[/b]

[i]Maybe[/i] buy the game on sale, if you get the chance.

This is a very shaky ""not recommended"" review. I like the core game and will probably keep playing as long as my friends keep inviting me, but the awkward game feel, killer imbalances, and mass amount of paywall-locked characters mock me just a little too much. Consider this less of a ""this game sucks"" and more of a ""this developer sucks"".",1570926175,1708309901,False,1,1,0.490865558385848999,0,True,False,False

They attracted enough players during Beta Testing and decided that what they had already developed was good enough, and this is what we got. 

It's crazy that so many maps have power outages and every single solitary one is magically fixed with some gasoline powered generators. Terrible development and just an excuse to release a record setting amount of useless DLC.

This is easily the most predatory and lazy developer on Valve's Storefront. Do not support them. There is a reason every single other product they have ever touched has already been taken off the market. They only care about your wallet. Period.

Rémi Racine does not deserve your time nor investment. Simply look at their featured video game products of the last decade. Where is Deathgarden? Where is Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade? How did Meet Your Maker turn out? Every single product they release gets shut down. This studio can only make iOS and Android games, and those are questionable at best. Stop supporting predatory low life companies. This company has proven time and time again they haven't the faintest idea of how to develop or market a video game product. Let them rot and go under.

Edit: Behaviour Interactive's Chief of Staff going on a tirade on LinkedIn regarding Palworld's success comes off extraordinarily childish and jealous. I am honestly impressed this imbecile has a job at any game development studio. I can promise you that after seeing this young man seethe with envy publicly, I will never be touching this product again. Train your staff better!

Even loosing is a good time, as I love horror games and being scared and startled is part of the fun for me. With that though, if you don't like being scared and the intensity of being chased or having to hide, then this definitely isn't a game for you.

While running around as a serial killer and killing the other players is fun, there are some huge minuses to the game.
One of them being that I have to hold back when I play killer, most of the times I'll pretend I didn't see that guy and let him save his friend.
The only way for Survivors to actually beat me fair and square is to be sneaky and make noises on the other side of the map to trick me away from the other Survivors.
Something that is seen as cancerous by the Killers, such as ""Flashlight blinding the Killer mid-animation"", ""Looping"" around an obstacle forever or until I give up and ""body blocking me until the Survivor manages to wiggle free"" is the only other way for Survivors to actually counter a Killer.
The only response I have to any of the above is to Alt+Tab out of the game or kill one of them and camp their hooks.
But Survivors hate being camped, it essentially removes them from the game and if they fuck up early, they can end up being an Observer for 10-20 minutes.
There is no reason for me to not hook and camp a Survivor, there's nothing in the game preventing me from doing so, I just have to ""be a good guy and play 'fair'"" for it not to happen.

I used to love this game. Unfortunately the developers don't listen very well to it's player base. I'm a killer main, and I have loved Pyramid Head since release. There have been zero adjustments to him since release. I can't have fun with him because his play style, add-ons, and perk combos leave only 1 or 2 different builds and survivors know the builds. This makes for extremely boring play. New players don't get generator slowing perks without buying past the paywall. The fixes that they finally implement, have been fixes people have been asking for, for YEARS. There are so many more issues, but this post is already pretty long.
DBD is a money grab now, and that's at it's best. Don't buy it if you're new, it's wasted money. Just wait for the next asymmetrical game that will top it. It's been almost 10 years, so I'm sure something will come out soon",1708186500,1708186500,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The devs don't listen to their player base, and they continue to nerf and buff perks when they're fine. Deadhard has been nerfed several times and it doesn't even work half the time. Pallets don't drop when you're on TOP of them. Hits that shouldn't hit, do hit. You will often get teleported to the other side of a pallet both as survivor and killer and get fucked because of it.
They released a killer that received the worst reception ever and still released her to the public despite the negative perception and ""buff"" and ""nerf"" her when she's just a bad killer concept. They nerf survivors into the ground and it feels more like you're playing a victim. The devs think that tunneling and camping are valid ways to play but it's the most boring game you will ever have and you will tier down because of that. Even when playing as killer it is not that much better. Hits that should hit don't.
The game is just unfair, broken, and not that much fun. You will run into the most selfish survivors when you're not with friends, and even when you are with friends you will most likely run into a tunneling or a camping killer. Because the devs think thats a good way to play. All in all. Just a horrible game with a horrible fanbase.
The anti-camping feature is broken but NOT FOR THE SURVIVORS. Killers can still camp pretty easily, it did nothing but add a little security blanket that doesn't even do anything for tunneling. It also gets disabled in end game so its basically useless.

1. The gameplay loop is dull and lacking. All you're ever gonna do is repair generators, or defend generators, with secondary fluff inbetween. I'd really like to see some other game modes, but after 5 years of no innovation I doubt I ever will.
2. Most of the characters are mute. I get that for survivors it's a stealth thing, but the dialogue wheel would've still been a nice way to flesh out characters. The game lacks personality badly, what's the point of all these brand names if you're not gonna let them speak? And there's no reason for killers not to have taunts. So much wasted roleplay potential. You'll never ""you can run but you can't hide!"" in this game.
3. Due to the nature of the game any slasher movie atmosphere potential that might've is wasted and tainted by gamification. The killer is disrespected like crazy, ran around in infinite loops (they really are infinite by definition) and generally isn't being avoided by skilled players. It looks a lot like Saturday cartoon with poor villain getting dunked on with pallets, blinded by flashlights, stunned by locker doors, etc. I swear, any day now they'll add survivor perk that lets you punch the killer in the honker directly.
At least Ghostface feels right at home given how inadequate he's portrayed in the movie.
4. Rampant cheating at mid to high ranks. Apparently ""Easy"" in Easy Anti-Cheat stands for  ""easy to bypass"".

Now the pros:
1. Tons of licensed characters and maps, from Silent Hill's infamous school to Resident Evil's Raccon City police station, from Ash Williams to Michael Myers. It's a dream team. If only the actual game was fun to play.
That's all for the pros.

It is inherently imbalanced, which is a source of many frustrations, but there *was* fun to be had, especially with friends and alcohol. This game is heavily favored for killers. For some context, survivors had some tools to combat the imbalance, but they were heavily exploited: infinite loops, glitches, insta-blinds, hatch mechanics, etc. But over the years the pendulum has swung the other way. Every tool survivors had had, in-game mechanic, or otherwise, has been taken away. Gens take longer to repair, survivor perks have been nerfed, killer perks have been buffed, killers vault faster, ranks have been obfuscated, and match making has always been broken (i.e. players are *not* of similar skill-level), loops have been patched out.

One of the biggest sources of frustration are killer-strategies that ruin the experience: tunnelling (hyper fixating on one-survivor to get them out the game as soon as possible). Strategically, this makes sense, the sooner you can take out a survivor, the better odds none of the survivors will escape – survivor’s survival is predicated on cooperation and distracting the killer. The problem: the survivor that falls victim of this strategy isn't afforded a change to participate in normal gameplay - this is compounded with the aforementioned nerfs/patches. One of the last mechanics that remained to combat this behavior was blocking – you could block killers that intentionally ruined the experience, so in theory, you wouldn’t be matched against them again. But, a fairly recent update removed the ability to block players so now there is nothing being done about game-ruining strategies. Wouldn’t be as bad if the match-making ever worked, but it doesn’t. If anything, these strategies are encouraged and rewarded. Now as I write this, after having being in a full squad of friends, inebriated, and trying to play for fun, I just feel deflated. Fun was not had after our 6+ matches were fun. 1200+ hours in, and I’m done. 

Bottom line, this game is so imbalanced that is is just not fun – I say this as player that uses unconventional perks and plays inebriated (i.e. I don’t take this game seriously): it’s so broken you can’t even make your own fun anymore. The devs have blatantly said through their actions/updates survivors are not meant to survive. The fun has always been in the glimmer of hope, and the unpredictability and ensuing chaos. Now matches are predictable – killers will result to cheap tactics without penalty, and I will die on hook.

I'll go with the latter. If you queue survivor and the killer finds you and hooks you, they'll probably just wait nearby for someone to pick you up and put you back on the hook again. I think it's a horrible thing they've done where they don't separate Casual play and Ranked play unless you already have like 4 other friends who can play the game with you. I don't have 4 friends with this game. Additionally, I  think from the killer's perspective survive with friends is kind of unfair. There's literally perks in the game that let you know where people are. There's no voice chat or text chat, but if you're on Discord or Teamspeak you completely get around all of that. I think survivors can be really toxic, too. There's literally only about a minute of chat before and after the match and somehow survivors still manage to be toxic. It makes it kinda horrible inviting friends to play knowing they'll just get farmed and raged at in post game. Now, if you can get over all of that unbalanced gameplay, then this game is probably for you. It's supposed to be a team game, but I've found that if you're in a group on a call, it's unfair to the killer by a large margin. If you're a survivor and not in the group in the call, they'll probably be jerks to you and leave you to die and then talk shit at you in the postgame chat. It makes it pretty impossible to recommend this game to anyone. 

(EDIT: The new skill-based matchmaking is so broken that it can't even match you up at your proper rank, with rank 18 and 19 killers (ranked out of 20) often having to face survivors who are half their rank and therefore significantly more experienced or vice versa. At least before if you lost, you lost to someone who was your equal ranking or within 2 or 3 of you)


EDIT 11/22/2021: Still wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy. This game sucks for killers. I say this as someone who has hit Rank 1 Survivor and Rank 1 Killer.

EDIT 7/19/22: They added a prestige update which should have cut down grind, but has taken away teachable killer perks from me since I haven't prestiged every killer. This patch is terrible and I continue to not recommend this game.

EDIT 6/10/23: There is a rank reset every 13th that sets everyone back to the bottom, which is good. I didn't mention that before. There are also matchmaking incentives when one role is not as full to encourage people to switch. However, an issue that negatively affects match quality is that everyone is currently rage quitting when they get caught a single time or disconnecting from being caught once, pretty much dooming their 3 teammates.

Targeted, hunted, no place to run.

Makes every moment feel so mean.
Tunnelled through the game, it's just not fair,
Alone with my despair, gasping for air.

Every chase feels like a dead end,
No allies, no help, just a trend.
The loneliness in this endless chase,
Brings tears I can hardly face.

Is a heavy load, hard to forget.
Stuck in this cycle, no escape in sight,
In the darkness, I lose my fight.

Of being left out, again and again.

STBFL is slower now, The few killers I use it on aren't even fun anymore the risk has no more reward. The devs are incompetent, and waste potential at every corner. Fun addons get turned into boring percentages and numbers plugged into an excel sheet. The survivors I play against play like bots and always know what you're doing nothing is fun. All the matches are boring all the comp people win too much on regular lobbies everyone has too many hours the skillcurve is too high this game is not Casual at all I can't sit down and enjoy this shit show anymore. Thank you BHVR for slowly growing inept with dementia and forgetting all the fun people had in the old while slowing chipping away at fun at every chance you get so the dumb idiots on twitter praise you for how many rainbow flags you put into the game. Meanwhile all the killers get worse and more slow.

I'm so tired of this game I have 500 other games on my backlog 

Too many cheaters play this game, too little micro changes and adjustments that take months. DBD NetEase that team is crazy good at implementing creative change and risk compared to the hazbins we have on Main DBD. Lobby loadouts, alternate game mode that is always up, better skins and mori animations in general.

DBD main is so stagnant and bad with keeping up, honestly the incremental changes are so little so late sometimes you're waiting years for a rework and fix to happen. Meanwhile they reworked Sadako 3-4 times and the final result is much worse than what we had to begin with. This team is f-**** stupid, you take the fun out of one character and meanwhile buff and make one character fun while everything else becomes so bad. Red VHS used to be the best addon on Sadako you could turn TVs back on if you got hits and rewarded an aggressive and fast playstyle when paired with STBFL and PWF it was a powerhouse build. It's not possible to do that with the addon anymore on a good team. They increase the downtime of TVs by 20% and lowered the time survivors need to insert tapes from the 2-3 second window to 1 second flat. And by making her condemn need to be charged overtime instead of something you just passively issue makes it harder to even just focus on playing the game in general. They keep trying to make Sadako more complex but more balanced and boring and killing all her good addons. This team doesn't know a damn thing about balance. They keep nerfing pig it just shows how out of touch they are. WHO EVEN PLAYS PIG? Why do you need to nerf her because your excel spreadsheet statistics are telling you the 10 people that play pig use one addon. That makes the game fun and bearable on one of the weakest characters and they nerf fun to oblivion. I hate this team. They focus on the wrong things all the time and get rewarded for being lazy and doing the bare minimum. Evil Dead was like the closest thing to like a breathe of fresh air I think the skill tree focus over infinite replay-ability kind of cornered them and ported to Steam too late. The gameplay was there it was genuinely fun. I can't understand why FUN and innovation has to lose to this Cancerous tumor of a game that has rotted the Asymmetrical genre and has been so creatively bankrupt and dodges risk. They won't even add Springtrap, Big Daddy(Bioshock), Amnesia, Outlast, Evil Within. Like something that isn't a Big Blockbuster movie, doesn't need to be a movie like a whole chapter. People been asking making entire videos for these, and yeah there is Chucky and Alien but I'm like Chucky and Alien is so old and Noobies won't hop on this game in the Teen and tween bracket and they fail to reach into new younger audiences. As a killer main having an aging and mostly veteran audience makes the game so sweaty and hard. ""There are no casual matches of DBD"" even with MMR off they fail to attract new audiences and the same 32k has been buying and carrying this game for too long. It's exhausting these people are too good to keep up and catch the Jones. Kids could keep up but its the same kids and Adult streamers with no other jobs or hobbies that play the same game 24 hours a day and have 10k hours logged. AND THERE ARE NO NOOB PLAYERS no christmas noobs no new fresh faces just sweaty P100 lobbies that don't even want you to touch them or get 1 hook. So excessively greedy and so excessively competitive with no ranking system or ranked mode that can help incentivize competitive play over there with greedier playstyles while letting all the people looking for fun and the nooby players stick on unranked. But the devs are so stupid they come up with the dumbest most lazy excuses ""Oh Q times will be longer"" ""The game is a casual party game"" ""The game is naturally unbalanced"" What are all these balance updates for? What is the meta now?

X Fun perk is used, devs see X fun perk being used. X perk is nerfed until nobody wants to use it devs add new potentially ""fun"" meta changing perk on licensed chapters because you'll feel the need to buy them. Unlicensed chapters usually don't get strong perks they get supplementary perks or accommodating perks for a certain killer or niche subset of builds. The entire structure of how ""fun"" content is ripped out of the game all the time and added in new perks that are unbalanced as ""Fun"" is so dumb. They play stupid if it makes them money but us having fun with pre-existing perks doesn't make them money. 

I don't really get it anymore. I feel detached from the fanbase, the community is toxic in a different way. Kind of gatekeepy to when it comes to gameplay hour requirements. Don't even enjoy the game as much as a game I have 50 hours on. It is just a timewasting game, with really long matches, toxic teams and killers alike. Hackers that just enjoy sucking what little joy and competence I have left. Just bloodsucking leeches everywhere always whining and complaining about the wrong things. The conflict is artificial and irrelevant BHVR benefits off of having a childish and divided fanbase they can manipulate into liking anything they do. The divide would be irrelevant if they added party centric gameplay changes where either party or random survivors are forced to play killer and killers would have to play survivor like a tag mode but BHVR creates the perfect entitled ""Survivor Main"" or ""Killer Main"" vs a person that just plays whatever is fun. These pride themselves and rub their noses and spit on eachother and will ruin matches in any way they can think of so no one can have fun. The TTV problem is irritating too, not them playing really sweaty or always being really overconfident and trying to impress their audience for clips and views. But like legit hacking SWFs that will lagswitch and cheat or attack your IP if they feel threatened. DBD BHVR this ecosystem they have created with the gameplay and the vibe around it has created these selfish selfish entitled human beings scraping from little ounces of clout by sucking what little enjoyment you had left. 

This game has also died like spiritually it kinda forgot what fun was in the process of balance. And over the years like Borrowed Time was not basekit but we had DeadHard and DS and somehow that was more fun even though it was an unbalanced mess. People had Selfcare and could heal themselves all the time. Killer had slower hit cooldown but it was still fun and stupid because people actually valued chases. Losing was okay but if I'm a P100 losing is unacceptable and I need to throw a fit and let you know how much of a loser you were and how easy the match was. 

P100 is so unfulfilling and they are to lazy to add P100 cosmetics or a special achievement a pat on the back for grinding my ass off. Something anything. You get nothing.

First off, let's talk about the good stuff. Dead by Daylight is like that snack you can't stop munching on—it's addicting as heck. The rush of narrowly escaping death or pulling off a clutch save is enough to get your heart racing faster than a caffeinated chihuahua. Plus, the variety of killers and survivors keeps things fresh. I mean, who doesn't want to outrun a chainsaw-wielding maniac or play hide-and-seek with a ghost?

But here's the tea, folks: the game can turn sour quicker than expired milk. The community can sometimes be saltier than a bag of potato chips left out in the sun too long. From rage-quitting survivors to camping killers, it's like navigating through a minefield of bad vibes. And let's not even get started on the unbalanced gameplay. Ever feel like you're running a marathon with cement shoes while the killer's sprinting in Nikes? Yeah, me too.

Sure, we get it—the killer's gotta kill. But there's a fine line between playing the game and being a total buzzkill. Some killers just don't get the memo that it's possible to have fun without ruining someone's day. But fear not, my friends, because amidst the sea of toxic players, there are a few shining stars—the fun killers who make the game worth playing. Whether it's a spooky nurse or a sneaky pig, these killers know how to keep things interesting without making you wanna rage-quit.

So, is Dead by Daylight worth the grind? Absolutely. Just be prepared for a rollercoaster ride of thrills, chills, and the occasional urge to throw your controller at the wall. And hey, if all else fails, remember: there's always another match just around the corner. So grab your flashlight, sharpen your machete, and get ready for one hell of a showdown.

They don't know or don't care how to balance perks and killers of this game. I don't count how much perks that give killer a wall-hack ability on a game that should be a ""hide and seek"" which doesn't reward at all the survivor for trying to hide from the killer. Each new killer they release is even more stupid and strong compare to other killers. 
The system of ""anti face-camp"" is useless af, it doesn't stop like nurse, huntress, or other killer who can dash, teleport, speed boost to camp on the hook.
They nerf the size of the map that the killer can easily found you and camp on the generators. 

I guess they prefer to make only skins to sell and put all the lgbtq+ charms instead of fixing the game.

Oh yeah, this community is also the most toxic I've ever seen, when a killer is doing game hostage, camping on the hook, focus only one survivor, the 4 squad survivors bullying the killer etc... League of Legend community is better than this one.

I really hope they bring cross progression into the game because plenty of players, including myself, have made the switch from console to PC and are missing out on some of those sweet, sweet Rift charms that we spent hours grinding for, as well as plenty of progress and items on several killers and survivors.

BHVR has just recently made the functionality with the Lights Out mode; we can expect to see new gamemodes with this new framework. This is some pretty exciting stuff for all veteran players.

Killer right now is very strong if you play your cards right. I know survivors will complain about tunneling and killers sometimes feel forced to do it with how competitive the game has gotten. I think there are some measures that can be taken to make changes to the problems that are presented in the game; however, I understand that BHVR is walking on thin ice when it comes to changes as sometimes it can become gamebreaking... example: old overcharge and call of brine.

With the recent Hillbilly changes and adjustments to other killers, playing survivor is progressively getting more fun. Some killers sincerely need an entire rework or change, such as Skull Merchant who has such a complex kit that it takes a f%cking dictionary to learn all of her capabilities... when compared to Hillbilly who is inarguably stronger and just ""chainsaw go zoom grahhhh"", y'know.

I think BHVR needs to continue to veer away from overly complex killers and continue in simplicity in strength. Every top tier killer has some form of counterplay in some regard that is related to their strength... i.e. Nurse is hit hard by stealth because she moves so slowly its slower to investigate every nook and cranny; Blight can be countered by good movement and understanding how his bumps work; Hillbilly can be countered with use of windows and the CTRL key (hahaha).

Anyways, that's enough yapping. If you are new to the game, there are plenty of content creators that can teach you the ropes in just a few videos for both killer and survivor. I strongly recommend picking up a killer you are interested in first, and then moving onto killers that you would like to get perks from. Same goes for survivor.

Dead by Daylight remains a stellar horror game, continuing to provide an immersive and entertaining experience. The core concept of four survivors evading a relentless killer persists, offering a consistently thrilling gameplay dynamic. The extensive playtime has only deepened my appreciation for the game's nuances.

One of the standout features is the extensive variety offered by both survivors and killers. The multitude of perks available for each, coupled with distinct abilities, adds layers of strategy and complexity to each match. The randomized maps, a feature I highlighted in my initial review, continue to impress by ensuring that no two encounters play out the same way, even on familiar terrain, because there are different layouts to almost all of the maps as well. That means that even if you play the same map, you won't be getting the exact same one!

Remarkably, with 882 hours under my belt, Dead by Daylight has maintained its stability and polish. The absence of significant issues over such an extensive period reinforces the game's overall quality and durability. Another aspect that I love, is the continual introduction of licensed killers and survivors. The inclusion of iconic characters like Wesker, Nemesis, and Michael Myers has significantly enriched the gameplay experience, creating a captivating blend of horror fandom and intense multiplayer action.

The infusion of these recognizable faces into the game not only pays homage to beloved franchises but also introduces unique abilities and playstyles that diversify the overall Dead by Daylight experience. Each licensed killer and survivor brings their own set of perks and characteristics, seamlessly integrating their distinct personalities into the game's evolving narrative.

Wesker, known for his sinister presence in the Resident Evil series, Nemesis, the relentless pursuer from the same franchise, and the infamous Michael Myers from Halloween all contribute to the varied and thrilling encounters players can experience. The familiarity with these characters adds an extra layer of tension, knowing that you're being pursued by some of the most iconic figures in horror.

The developers' commitment to consistently adding such renowned characters demonstrates a dedication to keeping Dead by Daylight fresh and relevant. It not only caters to the existing fan base but also attracts new players intrigued by the prospect of facing off against or embodying these well-known personas.

For those who share a passion for horror games and have dedicated significant time to Dead by Daylight, the enduring appeal of the game is evident. It not only captures attention but retains its grip, making it a worthwhile investment for any horror gaming enthusiast. I recommend it to all my horror fan boys and girls alike! 8.5/10

Overall, when you start playing this game you can have a lot of fun: you can experiment with different perks, open new survivors and killers, play with your friends. In your first game you'll be scared (100% sure). But after playing a while you will notice subtle [u]cheaters[/u] that ruin your game. ""Behaviour"" is not going to change this because they said they don't see a problem with that. Okay, moving to community.

[b]Toxic survivors or killers[/b]. If you will play more, you will have higher ranks and this is the point where you will see t-bags or facecamping in every 2-3 games. If you're unlucky, then be prepared for insults in post-game chat. At first, you might consider this offensive or annoying, but you have to remember that these people are angry. If you can deal with all this stuff, then i will talk about things that will (finally) make you exhausted.

[i]Servers[/i]. As much as i know, your hits(or escapes) will go through validation from the server that decides whether you get hit or not. And most of the time, if the survivor uses dead hard(David King's perk), then your hit is not going to be considered as a down state for the survivor. In other words, survivors that are using dead hard can just escape your hit and continue to run, even when you saw blood and heard their screams. You can think that this is not going to be a big problem, but at least 1 survivor in every match uses it(mostly, it's minimum 2). 

How i see this game over the time? For me, it's getting boring. People use the same meta perks(both survivors and killers) and even if you will use some fun perks - you will lose because the other side don't think the same way you do. For some reason, Behaviour is starting to realize only [b]now[/b] that there are perks that are waaaay stronger than others. And it's the perks that you will see in every single game. 
Right now I have fun only playing in custom games because custom game with friends(who aren't tryhards) look like what this game was supposed to be - entertaining, scary and unpredictable. Sadly, it's not. It's own community(with a little help of work team) that is destroying any fun both sides can have in this game.

UPD AT 15 FEB. 2024:

Honestly, i don't know what got into me, but i started playing again after a long period of brake. And quite frankly, this game had many changes happen to it(which i didn't like - i miss old Dead hard, for example). BUT. Somehow those changes...made game better? I guess i just had to trust the process. I don't play much with friends, like i did before, but even playing alone - it's still fun and exciting. I don't know what they sprinkled in this boiling soup of pain and joy, but it worked - i enjoy the game the same way i enjoyed it when i just started(which was 2 years ago). New killers honestly make me scream, especially Chucky. I think this game is going to keep changing for the better and i'm here for it.",1649946091,1707997457,True,0,0,0.549885392189025879,2,True,False,False

But it is not balanced at all, and the whole game is clearly designed for the survivors to get by, and ultimately, at least one of the four. Survivors can do anything, including gain superhuman powers, while killers are reduced to running around like old men, jumping through windows like pensioners, getting stunned by sticks or lamps, not to mention time consuming. recharge between two attacks, the too many hiding places, and the numerical differences (the groups communicate by microphone).

Nonetheless with the constant changes to the game, it has become increasing frustrating and unplayable. The cons of this game outweigh the pros. Here are some issues with the game:

1. F'ing pu_c developers won't put voice chat. 
2. The rank system is horrible. A experienced solo player will often than not get matched up with inexperienced players.
3. Toxic players.
4. The wiggle mechanic is useless and utter garbage. It needs a rework. Hooks are placed too close to each other. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO POINT IN WIGGLING. The wiggling meter moves to slow. Here is a solution: increase the movement rate or decrease the successful skill check as the meter gets closer to full. Also,  someone has to take a hit and the timing has to be perfect for a captured survivor to escape. Majority of the time, killers have no problem with the survivor wiggling in their grasp.
5. Toolboxes and health kits charges have exponentially decreased in usage/repairing a generator. 
6. The hit radius from the killer is ridiculous - you can still get hit when fully vaulted over a window or pallet. 
7. There are too many constant changes to the maps and game-play that are not necessary nor needed. This is done in favor of the killer because the placement of some windows or pallets in certain maps are op. (They - the developers even acknowledged this in a recent update and took out some pallets. Also, the success rate of escaping was probably too high and the developers probably wanted to decrease this amount. Which lead to camping hooked survivors, disconnects, complaints, and less players willing to play as the killer.
8. A stacked killer will win the majority of their games unless they ride the small bus to school.
9. Some killers are overpowering including the perks they use and offerings.
10. This game support the alphabet community. Players can equip a rainbow badge.
11. When you are cleansing a totem, the character ( while uninjured) will make a sound like they are having a hard time taking a dump. Like why add this to the game? This gives away your position, especially if a killer is near by or a survivor is getting chased. 
12. The camping meter that the developers implemented is stupid. The timer will still be shown after a survivor's second hook. Why? There is no reason to show it because at this point, the survivor has no chance to escape from being hooked. Also, if all generators are completed, the camping hook timer becomes unavailable. Another dumb decision because this gives the killer the opportunity to camp one hooked survivor because he or she gets dominated in game or is just a loser.

game was good but then the realm beyond happened and it just went downhill from there. I have never seen a dev team change so much shit that NOBODY asks for. 

Don't forget that the only killers that they release now are anti loop or have 30 different aspects that allows killers to have the game played for them, for example Skull Merchant literally gains multiple positive status effects including haste which in return the survivors recieve HINDERED making survivors have to hold w until they run out of loops because she can literally shut down every pallet instantly. And I dont even wanna get into The Knight who literally has a whole AI play the game for him on the press of right click. Xenomorph is get hit or get hit bc of tail swipe.

The game was fun years ago when it first came out. It was my absolute favorite game for years! Now it's just an unbalanced mess. Sometimes it's heavily killer-sided, others survivor-sided. The devs are too busy pushing out skins and new killers/survivors instead of working on balance, and sadly at this point there's too many killers and survivors available that balancing the game seems almost impossible. 

The gameplay is waaay too repetitive. I wish they had added different ways to escape similar to Friday the 13th or even Texas Chainsaw Massacre, like the devs originally promised during the early years. Instead, they change things that most people aren't asking for, like UI updates and perk overhauls that somehow made the balance problem more obvious! 

There's a ton of OP perks on both sides that EVERYONE picks, regardless of character. Clearly this indicates a balance issue, especially when there are over 200 perks available to choose from.

The amount of paid DLC for this game is absolutely terrible, and a very obvious cash grab at this point.

This is not the DbD it was when I first reviewed it, and I can't recommend this to other players in its current state.

At its core, the game is surprisingly straightforward: four survivors must escape from a killer in a closed environment. Yet, within this simplicity lies a deep, competitive edge that keeps both newcomers and veterans on their toes.

The game’s mechanics are easy to grasp but hard to master, making it accessible to players of all skill levels. Whether you’re strategizing with teammates to evade the killer or using the environment to your advantage, every match offers a new, fun challenge that’s as unpredictable as it is exciting. The variety of killers and survivors, each with their unique abilities, adds layers of strategy and replayability that keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging.

What sets Dead by Daylight apart is its ability to surprise. Just when you think you have the game figured out, it throws a curveball that changes the dynamics of the match. This could be a sudden appearance of the killer, a new obstacle, or an unexpected ally move, keeping the adrenaline pumping and ensuring that no two games feel the same.

Moreover, Dead by Daylight fosters a competitive atmosphere that’s hard to find elsewhere. The thrill of narrowly escaping the killer’s grasp or successfully hunting down every survivor is unmatched, driving players to constantly improve their skills and strategies. This competitive spirit, combined with the game’s fun and engaging gameplay, makes Dead by Daylight a standout title in the multiplayer genre.

In conclusion, Dead by Daylight is a must-play for anyone looking for a game that’s simple to understand, competitive at heart, full of surprises, and, above all, incredibly fun. It’s a testament to how a straightforward concept can be transformed into a deep, engaging experience that keeps players coming back for more.",1707906914,1707906914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Developed by Behaviour Interactive, this multiplayer gem offers an adrenaline-fueled experience like no other.

Gameplay:
The core gameplay loop of Dead by Daylight is both simple and addictive. As a survivor, you must work together with your teammates to repair generators scattered across the map, all while evading the killer's pursuit. Each survivor has unique abilities and perks, adding depth to the cooperative experience.

On the flip side, playing as the killer offers a completely different perspective. With a variety of terrifying killers to choose from, each with their own distinct playstyle and abilities, hunting down the survivors is an intense and satisfying experience. Whether you prefer the stealthy approach of the Trapper or the brutal force of the Hillbilly, there's a killer to suit every playstyle.

Atmosphere:
Dead by Daylight excels in creating a tense and atmospheric environment that keeps players on the edge of their seats. From the eerie sound design to the chilling visuals, every aspect of the game contributes to its spine-tingling atmosphere. The asymmetrical nature of the gameplay further enhances the tension, as both survivors and killers must rely on their wits to outsmart their opponents.

Progression:
The game offers a robust progression system that rewards players with new perks, items, and customization options as they level up their characters. Whether you're unlocking powerful survivor perks or gruesome new cosmetics for your favorite killer, there's always something to strive for in Dead by Daylight.

Community:
One of the game's greatest strengths is its passionate and dedicated community. With a thriving player base and active developer support, Dead by Daylight offers endless opportunities for collaboration and competition. Whether you're teaming up with friends for a late-night gaming session or facing off against strangers in a heart-pounding showdown, the community aspect of Dead by Daylight adds an extra layer of excitement to the experience.

Overall, Dead by Daylight is a must-play title for fans of asymmetrical multiplayer games and horror enthusiasts alike. With its gripping gameplay, spine-tingling atmosphere, and thriving community, it's no wonder that Dead by Daylight continues to captivate players around the world. So grab your flashlight, sharpen your machete, and prepare to dive into the heart-pounding world of Dead by Daylight.

The developers behind this game have made it continuously clear that in-game behaviour - targeting players in a single match, moves/movements that do not require skill and make the game less playable for the other side, and/or actions that down right stop the other side from being able to play - are not bannable as they would be in other games. Behaviour that would be considered inappropriate and mechanics that would be overpowered are allowed to persist.

For a whole year, I was a killer main as if it were a job, but then it hit me: Why am I playing this? So, I took a break, rediscovered my love during Halloween, and rejoined the creepy fun.

Back then, I collected every killer during those sales, and here's the big revelation: don't overdo it on the killer side. The real charm is being the survivor, especially with friends. It's like you're in a horror movie, but you get to laugh at your friends' screams.

I switched to Steam because Epic Games felt like endless gaming, and now I'm back in the game with my buddies. Playing with friends turns this game from depressing to fun.

My advice: Dead by Daylight – is not perfect, but it's still pretty awesome. Play with friends for the best time, go solo for a challenge, and maybe be the killer once in a while. Despite the killer burnout, I'm giving this game a solid 7/10 – sanity is overrated anyway. Happy surviving, folks!",1700364335,1707849759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The match is just around 10 minutes, does not take very much time, and I don't have to be eager to win like many other games. This game is about scaring people or being scared, not about winning.

As a newbie, I see quite many information about the game, and it a little gives me a headache. But after experiencing a few matches, it is not as complicated as I think. The game also has a tutorial mode, quite helpful. But I think the 'Game Manual' should be posted on the official website where I can 'Alt+Tab' to read while reading Power, Perk, Add-on, Offerings, etc. I also try reaching devs for feedback, and they reply to me quicker, more clearly, and more politely than expected (they do not ignore me as many comments I have read online about BHVR devs).

Truly, l don't have many times to play, but I enjoy this game, and I do not regret buying it. If you're considering, just buy it, it is really fun!

I hope that soon I will see my favorite horror character (Art The Clown in The Terrifier movie series directed by Damien Leone). I know many of you here know this brutal devil, much creepier than Myers.",1707849295,1707849493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Review:
Dead by Daylight is a game that's hard to define. My first encounter was tough, but something kept pulling me back. After about 10 hours of gameplay, I fell in love with it. The game thrives on tension and unpredictability, especially at lower ranks. But as you climb the ranks, the gameplay evolves into a test of skill and strategy. The higher the rank, the better the experience.

Now, after 300 hours, I'm hooked. Dead by Daylight is a journey of perseverance and triumph. If you're up for a challenge, I highly recommend it. It only gets better the more you play.",1707826632,1707826632,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a high price of admission if you want to experience all the content it has to offer, and also there are lots and lots of mechanics that have been implemented over time that aren't explained all that well to new players.
I'd seriously recommend learning a fair amount about how the game works before trying to play it, as it'll make your new player experience much smoother.
My main draw to this game for the 3ish years I vaguely knew about it before buying, was that it seemed like it was an adrenaline-pumping game, and that the primary source of enjoyment came from making exciting and daring plays, not necessarily winning.
I don't expect to win every game, but I do my best to use all that I've learned to do well, and that's what I think a lot of people should try to do if they want to get the most enjoyment possible.
Play to play well. Winning is just a side objective that can come from doing things well.

Yes I do play this game and will continue until the meta perks and killers are unbearable, yet I don't think it's something managable for any new player.

First of all no matter what your rank is you'll play against swetty people who have no accomplishments in life other than blinding people in a stupid game. They will use best characters, best perks, best addons, best items all the time. And worst is they are the majority. 

Then once you get the hang of the game, you'll see that you can't access most of the characters in both killer and survivor side. And then you'll realise newest characters always have the best perks, so if you don't buy them you hardly can compete. Even if you are not a meta player, there are no fun builds left viable. Trust me, I'vebeen trying.

And the funnier part about this games is that developers don't care about the state of the game. They have their player base that are willing to buy all the cosmetics and chapters even if they are trash.

As an asymmetrical 1v4 horror game balancing it is obviously going to be a challenge, however, it is possible if you listen to your player-base. Too often I see people asking in earnest for changes to be implemented. I've seen many phases of this game. Old dead hard, Old Boon: CoH, old ranking system, old prestige. My main issue with these things isn't that they were ""fixed"" its that the company behind this game took YEARS to do so. For example Billy finally got his stupid overheat ""fixed"" after 4 YEARS of him getting shunned and nerfed. 

I dont agree with the way this game does DLC related Microtransactions. Too reminiscent of EA and their Locking Characters behind paywalls. 

The game is repetitive. There are plenty of glitches and bugs that still are and may never be fixed.

It's new matchmaking is horrible for new players and players who just play for fun. Pubs and comp/ranked play should always be separated.

Its not innovative. Recent DLC has just been shoving licenses in your mouth. Licenses you CANT GET unless you pay real money for auric cells or buy it outright through steam, epic, ps store, xbox store, nintendo store. 

I think this game is a great example for a game premise that was excellent but a terrible execution of said premise.

The game seems like a good horror game, and it is for the first few hours, but that wears off eventually and it quickly becomes a competitive 4v1 asymmetrical game. I recommend checking out some of Otzdarva's videos to see what the game truly is. There is a huge learning curve (At least for some characters) and might require thousands of hours on this game to be ""Good"". For game play, you may or may not like it. 
There is the survivor side: repairing generators, distracting the killer, healing teammates, and trying to escape.
The killer side: Knocking down survivors, sacrificing the survivors to the entity, and slowing down the survivors as much as possible. 
The game will feel very unfair at time; there will be perks and addons from either side that seem to turn any situation to their favor and make you feel like you should have won. 
The community is also very toxic at times, and it can feel very discouraging to keep playing. But just remember, its a game, and I'm supposed to have fun. Ignore the endgame chat, don't go to the exit gates if the survivors opened it to watch them teabag you, and if you come across a group of survivors abusing game mechanics to give you a hard time (Bully Squads), there's no shame in disconnecting. If the game is irritating you, then just get off of it and get some fresh air, play a different game, or do something productive. 
So if your looking for a competitive 4v1, this is the game for you.",1707704738,1707704738,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really think this game is something unique and special, not only to me, but to many others as well. Ive been playing (on and off) since around 2019, so I've thankfully have been able to witness the games progress with its ups and downs. 

The game itself is different in a good way. I really don't get bored playing dbd, as there is alot of ways you can mix your perks as the survivor or the killer, to keep the matches enjoyable and not so repetitive. Its good that the play style from survivor to killer is so different. My heart is either racing trying to live and rescue fellow survivors, or when I'm trying to kill everyone. Either way it gets my anxiety up and my heart pumping - and I love every second of it. 

One of the good things about this game is that I don't really see that many cheaters in the game. I'm not sure if this is because of easy-anticheat, or because people don't feel the need to cheat. I have seen footage of cheaters and such, but I personally never went up against one. There are problems with the game though. The biggest problem I have (not sure how fixable this is) is the random server disconnection. Not just one person leaving, or the killer leaving, but a trigger that makes all survivors and the killer dc. The reason this sucks more then the killer dcing intentionally, is because you get no BP, and no progression on your player level. You spend upwards of 30 minutes on a match and all for nothing. It is really infuriating. The balancing of the survivors and killers and their perks are always a problem. It seems that when a new survivor or killer comes out, its somewhat either too powerful, or way too underpowerd. They are quick to change these problems, but its nice to have them already finished (or atleast usable) when they come out. Obviously like most games there are meta loadouts for survivors and killers. I really don't count this as a problem. I don't typically use the meta perks, and I usually get 3-4 kills every match as the killer (with Trapper and Doctor), and escape as survivor. So don't feel obligated or forced to use the meta perks, they ARE helpful, but do what you feel is most comfortable. 

Anyways, I love this game and its community. Its not perfect, but it is damn fun. 9/10.

Edit: New Lights Out (2024 for people in the future who might read this) mode is pretty neat. From my short experience so far, I have mixed feelings about it. It's pretty fun and a breath of fresh air from the base game. The new mode feels more 'casual' then the base game, as that feels much more competitive. A few problems I do have with the mode are as follows. 

1) I play killer and survivor 50/50 when it comes to the base-game. I have a lot of fun with both sides. That is not the case with lights out I'm afraid. I find myself playing killer much much much more then survivor for numerous reasons. I tried to play some survivor in LO but after the first few matches, once the thrill of being jump-scared wore off, it was really bare-bones and not very fun. With some killers (Ill get to that in my second point), its borderline impossible to win or at the very least have fun. There isn't much the developers can do to rework this mode, because at that point you would have an entirely new game mode. Some things I do suggest are making the generators louder for survivors and killers, not necessarily having any progression on them though, and making them have no auras for the killers, that way both have to use their ears in order to find the generators to either repair or damage. Maybe as the killer is hauling a downed survivor, they could brefiley see the auras of the nearest generators. 

2) As to what I said about borderline impossible matches, Myers, Ghostface, and Dredge. I LOVE Myers basegame and in LO, but these two modes are vastly different. In one of them, Myers at level 2 and 3 has a terror radius, visible red stain, and is visible (not pitch dark like in LO). In the other, Myers at level 2 and 3 has no terror radius (all killers have no terror radius in LO), a barely visible red stain, and isn't visible at all (its pitch black in LO.) The biggest problem with this in LO is obviously the level 3 Myers insta down. Atleast in base-game, you could see Myers approaching you to stalk you in level 2, AND hear his terror radius in level 3 for a chance of avoiding a insta-down. In LO, once Myers has almost leveld up to level 3 with his stalk, and finds you (when he stalks you, you can see the survivors auras much easier, and the survivors might not even know you're there), he can go to level 3 and then insta-down you without any warning. It feels the same way with Ghostface. And this isn't me being biased at all, like I said before, I am a huge Myers and Ghostface fan, but I can tell when something is overlooked like this. As for Dredge, what is his power really useful for? Making the game even darker? I say either rework these 3 just for LO, or remove them for LO in this game mode. 

3) This isn't really a criticism, but, man, if they added proximity chat to this mode, that would be HILARIOUS! Just imagine you have a voicechat range of 8-12 meters and can talk to your fellow survivors or to the killer. If the killer could also talk to the survivors, that would just be fantastic.

Anyways, Lights Out is pretty fun and entertaining for the time being. I hope they fix the the issues and balance out the killers for this game-mode before perm. releasing it. I give this game-mode a 6.5/10.",1577691068,1707676506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The basic concept is not new, a couple of humans try to survive against a beefed up super killer.
There is a large selection of maps, survivors, killers, perks, tools and add-on's to aid both the killers and survivors in their respective roles. If starting new it can be confusing or daunting, but if you intend on playing for fun you don't need to worry, just work out what you like. While the more competitive side of the game has a rather strict requirement for success in terms of strategies and builds.


[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]
The game has been around a while now, it looks old but it looks good. The developers have got it how they want you to play it and there is very limited options to change how the game looks. Its designed to be dark and spooky with a couple of tweaks available to aid sharper lines or better performance.

[h1]BALANCE[/h1]
The games balance is lacking. Depending how good your MMR is you will be in 1 of 2 positions.
1. Low MMR requires friends and team work to win, the killer is coming at you hard and fast and you don't know what to do about it.
2. High MMR has survivors who know what they're doing and if the killer isn't prepared with a set strategy and build they're going to have to work really hard to even stand a chance at winning.

[h1]COMMUNITY[/h1]
Its an online game. Expect toxicity, expect it thick and fast from all directions on both teams. But its not the worst community I've seen. We all complain a lot about the other team and how unfair it is that they've got it so easy.",1561919378,1707615516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I feel obligated to change my review; I'd played this back in 2017 when the game had very serious issues with how the game was handled overall. Getting into a match was slow, the game was very clunky and hard to deal with.
However; now, years later; they've not only released plenty of quality DLC, they've also fixed the issues with matchmaking and progression. I still see people having issues with unjustified bans now and again; and the game sometimes boots from lobbies for no apparent reason. This in mind; its a far improved game from what it was; and I think I can be confident in giving it a recommendation now.

[strike]Dead by Daylight? How about Dead by the time my group of friends gets into a game that isn't a private match. The gameplay is pretty solid, it's actually really fun; the concept is great too. However; getting into a lobby with a few friends is a nightmare that goes beyond Elmstreet. Me and my mates sat around for almost 20 minutes before saying F*** IT and making a private game. We had fun, sure, but it wasn't the same with only 3 players total. I'd say that it needs a btter match making system or including BOTs to fill places. I love the game playing alone, but with friends; not a chance. You either play solo, or spam matchmaking for an hour and pray to the gods you get in together. 6 out of 10 at best 3.5 at the worst. It's got decent graphics, a great theme, and fun gameplay; but al that falls apart when you can't play with friends. Such a shame...[/strike]",1488683161,1707601260,False,0,0,0.510756134986877441,0,True,False,False

music, good. graphics, good. concept? super fun! controls arent bad. but the gameplay. the community. oh my god. its so easy to burn out with dead by daylight. from teammates in soloq not being helpful, teaming with killers, killers tunneling noobs, teammates literally just giving up when something goes slightly wrong. seriously if youre a new player prepare to get tilted if you arent playing with three other friends on voice call. sometimes people are nice and fun, and those moments make me feel really good about the game, its what keeps me coming back. but thats only maybe 2-3/10 rounds. survivor is always either way too easy or way too hard due to killer cheesing, same with killer gameplay- either way too easy or absolutely stupid due to surv cheesing. at some point things start to feel kinda mundane. the recent lights out mode is fun and interesting, but its *so* unfortunate they made this community voted game mode last for just a few days.
being competitive and stuff in dbd is fun but its easy to become discouraged by factors listed above.

anyways, get it to play with friends, maybe dont get too invested if you want to stay sane. be prepared to go through an emotional roller coaster of decisive wins and completely unfair losses. DONT BUY THIS GAME TO PLAY ON YOUR OWN!!! playing as a solo survivor is painful, there is *SOMEHOW* no voice chat! pain!

(my credentials- i play both killer and survivor, almost 500 hours at the time of writing. maybe that isnt enough but its more than i have in many other games. ive played just about as much solo q as survive with friends. also have a good variety of characters in both categories... pls see my opinion as valid :,)",1707524491,1707524491,True,1,0,0.518716573715209961,0,True,False,False

The algorithm figured you like horror games, or maybe your friends play this game and you want to play with them, or you're looking just out of morbid curiosity. I don't know you, but let me welcome you to this magical realm of fog and crows and axe-murderers chasing horny teens - and lots of diesel generators lying around for some reason. God that's a lot of diesel generators.

Y'know the last 20 minutes of a horror movie, where everyone's running and screaming and bleeding? This is it. Why are you here? Doesn't matter. No really: The game is 7 years old and had no lore until 5 minutes ago. What is your motivation? Shallow: Survivors try to survive and Killers try to kill. How does it work? Repairing generators powers the exit gates so Survivors can escape. Putting an axe in the Survivors heads prevents them from escaping. Simple as. Imagine the edgiest game of hide-and-seek ever devised. That's it. That's the game, and it's terribly great fun. I know dudes with thousands of hours. Low complexity, high depth, like chess, in a game of 1 queen vs 4 pawns, and the pieces scream when you stab them.

Sure it's got some baggage that modern games lug around: Cosmetics, progression, unlocks, DLC, premium currency, challenges, season ratings. Some of that's alright, some of it's exploitative, and some of it I think would be great if I was allowed to overhaul it, but it is what it is. You either accept it or you don't. At least it doesn't have those apparently mandatory fishing and farming mini-games. Not yet anyway.

To prevent sticker shock, I recommend you grab the base game when it's on sale; I grabbed mine in August for $8, which gave me a couple months to see if I liked it before the annual Halloween Sale where basically everything is like +90% off. The base game starts you off with 7 Survivors and 5 Killers; that's enough to get you started and see if you want to stick with it. For all this crass monetization it is not pay to win. No amount of DLC will make up for skill. You git gud or you get hung on a meathook. 

Will you like this game? If you can stomach the gore, you probably will; it's got great staying power as multiplayer games go, with devs constantly working on balance issues, new characters and thus new skills, and new in-game events every month or so. However you gotta go in knowing this is a real skill-based PvP game and as such there's a steep learning curve. There is an invisible rating system called MMR so absolute noobs don't get roflstomped by grizzled veterans, but it can only do so much for you. Its best if you start playing with a veteran to show you the ropes!

Fair warning: Some players are toxic. It is a competitive multiplayer esport. Just rise above it; at least their harassment is limited to crude body-language in-game and mean-spirited post-game text chat (which you do not have to sit through). Survivors do not like being murdered (I know right?) and some get salty about it, making up for their inability to be aggressive in-game with aggression afterward. There's an elaborate system of do's-and-don'ts some players made up, using terminology like ""tunnelling"" and ""three-gen"" and ""Tombstone Meyers,"" that boils down to ""if I lose it's because you're a horrible person so I'm allowed to be nasty."" Pay it no mind. Keep calm and murder them. Again. And again.

11/10
Edit: Well 4k hours later and I still play this game.

I still think its really fun but not as fun as it once was and I wish more people would find common ground between having fun and sweating to win, its not very fun to have survivors bully the killer constantly and its not very fun to have the killer tunnel out survivors to secure a win. 

I think the newest events and the new game mode are a huge step in the right direction in making this game a really fun experience.

i worry for the new players though because with the massive amount of money they would need to spend to get every killer and survivor plus the sheer amount of game knowledge they would need to learn is insane. 

The best advice I can give new players is:

-Watch content creators like Otzdarva or hens333 who have a big catalogs of videos that teach basic and advanced steps to learn the game.

-Play the game for a long time to really learn the layouts of maps, killer powers, perks, items, and techs. 

-Don't give up if you have a bad game just use that game as a learning experience to apply to the next game.

-Play both side evenly because you learn to play the other side better by mimicking what they do to you.

-If you find you are getting tilted playing the game take a break. DBD isn't going anywhere.

In conclusion this game is ever changing and will hopefully continue to change for the better.

Cada partida es diferente y depende de la habilidad, la estrategia y la cooperación de los jugadores. El juego también tiene un buen sistema de progresión y personalización, que te permite desbloquear y mejorar habilidades, objetos y cosméticos para tus personajes favoritos.

Lo que menos me gusta de Dead by Daylight es que a veces el juego puede ser frustrante y desequilibrado, debido a algunos problemas técnicos, bugs, lag, o al comportamiento tóxico de algunos jugadores. También creo que el juego podría mejorar su aspecto gráfico y sonoro, que se quedan un poco atrás en comparación con otros juegos del género.

When I play survivor most of the time I get teammates that don't know how to loop or how to do gens or that just dc or let go on the hook, and I get killers that will tunnel a lot. 
The tunneling doesn't really bother me that much, just the fact that before tunnel would happen in 3-4/10 matches, but now it's in 9/10 matches.

And now about playing killer which in my opinion is the hardest role in the game, where most of my matches I get Discord teams that haven't left the game since the release and that gensrush like there's no tomorrow, and because of this I'm forced to use a stronger killer with 4 slowdowns to have a chance of wining.

Within this cursed domain, mortals dared to tread, unaware of the horrors that lurked beneath the veil of darkness.

In this twisted fairy tale, players are thrust into a macabre game of cat and mouse, where the roles of hunter and prey blur into a nightmarish dance of survival. The hunters, embodiments of terror and despair, stalk the dimly lit landscapes with an insatiable hunger for blood. Each hunter possesses unique abilities, derived from the darkest recesses of folklore and myth, to ensnare and ensnarl their hapless victims.

Meanwhile, the survivors, lost souls trapped in this ghastly purgatory, must evade the clutches of their relentless pursuers. With trembling hearts and frayed nerves, they scurry through decrepit ruins and desolate cornfields, desperately seeking sanctuary amidst the encroaching shadows.

Yet, even in the face of overwhelming odds, hope flickers like a solitary candle in the night. Working together, survivors can outwit their oppressors, mending shattered generators to unlock their path to freedom. But beware, for every heartbeat echoes like a drumbeat of doom, drawing the attention of the lurking horrors that haunt this accursed realm.

In Dead by Daylight, the line between dream and nightmare blurs, and the boundaries of reality dissolve into the abyss. With its haunting atmosphere, chilling gameplay, and spine-tingling suspense, this dark fairy tale of survival and sacrifice will leave players breathless and trembling, long after the final chapter has been written.

Not to mention MMR is awful. no matter how many games you win/loose you will always be placed in matches that you dont feel like you should be in. But really I can't stress how hard the community of this games makes it to love. all too often i run into killers and survivors that behavior in a toxic manor.

Will i still play? Probably. Friends make it bearable but if thats the case i would rather play a less stressful

Inegavelmente, o Dead by Daylight teve dias. Muitos razoáveis, a maioria ruim. Com randoms posers quen não têm a mínima noção de jogo (é so apertar um botão do mouse pra fazer gerador e o q eles fazem? exato, ficam defecando nos cantos do mapa. e sim, apertar um botão de um mouse e casualmente o espaço é o objetivo principal dessa obra fictícia de terror de qualidade meramente...questionável)
Joguei esse jogo por pouco tempo, mas ja percebi falhas estruturais durante a jogatina, baixa qualidade e inúmeros bugs que assim como nosso mestre Chucky disse em seu filme, contribuem para a pipa do vovô não subir mais.
Se você gosta de puro sofrimento e de pagar um psiquiatra, ai vc baixa essa obra de puro amadorismo constrangedor.

The skill based matchmaking in this game is taking all the fun out of the game for me, and I don't feel like its a game for me anymore. I have 200 hours in game and I'm *OK* at the game, but every single lobby I play in now is full of people with 3-4 thousand hours. This huge discrepancy in experience has made it so every game is a massive sweatfest, I run meta perks to try to keep up with the massive skill difference and it just isn't fun. I think it really sucks to say that I'm done with the game because I was having a ton of fun with it, but I think the way the devs have implemented MMR has ruined it for me.

To this day, there has been numerous improvements to accesibility and gameplay, though it leaves the game to be a bit bland imo. 
I'm also sad to see that the mobile version of DBD is getting more love than the base game despite the community asking for new modes, and so on.

I still DBD, but I can't make long sessions because killers still have the ability to trap you inside a game or leave you defenseless.

In my opinion Behaviour is more dedicated to making money out of DLCs and cosmetics (only for some characters) or starting new DBD related projects like new games or even movies, than making DBD better and more appealing.

Still, DBD is realisticaly the best asymetrical game out there, and it can still be worth playing with friends or for short sessions. Beware the learning curve though, your first games will not be fun.

I hope Behaviour will wake and start making more content and less cosmetics.",1707319611,1707319611,False,1,0,0.506641387939453125,0,True,False,False

Depending on what happens this game can either be completely miserable and pointless or relatively engaging and entertaining in each given round. 

With few lasting competitors this game has a happenstantial monopoly on its genre, which is ultimately its main redeeming feature.



From the perspective of the survivor this game is fundamentally balanced around the player always being individually disadvantaged versus to the murderer, due to the survivors having an overarching numbers advantage. When facing the murderer in one versus one scenarios, which occur most of the time, a survivor is inherently doomed to eventually get caught unless the murderer is completely ineffectual. Many special abilities that murderers have can expedite the process of catching survivors even further. This is presumably meant to be balanced out by the fact that survivors can coordinate their actions to become stronger as a group, except the game doesn't give survivors a proper means of doing such beyond a superficial heads up display that leaves most important information unknown. Rendering the survivor role inherently ramshackle by how it demands yet inhibits thorough coordination in competitive play.

The threat avoidance system in this game is overall sloppy and awkward. Survivors may avoid being chased by keeping out of sight yet the murderer can randomly find survivors by accident while searching or travelling around. Players can use certain environmental fixtures to prolong a chase but many are finite, can only be found in specific places, require knowledge to use effectively and only a limited amount of them are even effective at all. Many potential chase techniques that a survivor has are dependent on the murderer's reaction to that technique, rendering the outcome even more out of the survivor's control. In the end avoiding the murderer in this game is often a matter of luck due to the numerous random factors at play which either advantage or disadvantage the survivor in each moment; all weighed against the type of murderer they are up against and how effective the opposing player is at using them.

Survivors have to memorize the exact mechanics of several dozen unique murderer gimmicks just to have any hope of functioning against them in a chase. Yet almost every murderer's gimmick is fundamentally unfair as they either have no meaningful counterplay, counterplay that entirely hinges on situational luck or the counterplay is only effective against inexperienced players. Numerous murderer gimmicks also require minimal effort to even use, the murderer getting full value out of their special ability by simply pressing one or two buttons to either debilitate or outright catch survivors. In all but the most advantageous environments the murderer's input overwhelmingly takes priority over the survivor's, rendering much of a survivor's knowledge and dexterity largely pointless in more competitive levels of play where murderer's seldom make mistakes. Even the server connection itself rules in favour of the murderer's input which seldom results in lag disadvantaging them when compared to the survivor's connection.

There are a multitude of ways that the murderer can make the game completely miserable for survivors if they want to, and many of these methods require no real effort or tact to perform despite how distinctly advantageous they are. The murderer can camp a hooked survivor to stop others from saving them without making a huge sacrifice, the murderer can purposely choose to protect a clustered group of generators that are disproportionately easy to patrol, the murderer can leave survivors to bleed out on the ground for minutes, the murderer can focus down a specific survivor to quickly eject them from the match. The developers have slowly added in various mechanics to combat this kind of behaviour yet many of these solutions are ineffectual and may even be circumvented. The only other safeguard that survivors have is to equip perks which exclusively exist to aid them against unfair scenarios. Perks which may never have a chance to activate over a dozen rounds of play, consume valuable space in the player's build that entire time and must be bought first before the player can even get access to them.

This game is loaded with numerous items and perks that are either nearly useless or extremely situational to the point of being nearly useless. Most survivor perks are completely ineffectual outside of very random and uncommon situations, discouraging the player from choosing most perks in the entire game due to the low likelihood of them yielding results. Over the past several years the survivor role has only gotten two competitively strong new perks and both of them were eventually nerfed, yet the murderer role often receives decent perks with each new content release. There are only a handful of remotely strong survivor perks out of more than a hundred options by this point and all the while murderers enjoy a variety of oppressive and unpredictable build combinations.

In that same vein over the past several years the survivor role has only received a limited number of buffs, many of which exclusively served to discourage unfair elements of the game that the murderer could purposely benefit from; and as mentioned these changes do not actually even fix the problem they simply reduce it at best. Meanwhile when the murderer role is given buffs they are often fundamental improvements that just outright make the role more threatening; such as increasing the speed on all their generic actions, increasing their field of view or reducing the effectiveness of a common survivor item.

By comparison the murderer role enjoys a much more consistent and interactive gameplay experience only perturbed by more exceptional situations; although even it is mired by scattered balancing issues such as overly disadvantageous pieces of terrain, survivor teams coordinating with third-party software and maps which are disadvantageous to certain murderer gimmicks. Furthermore beyond that there are various overarching problems that impact both roles as well.

Outside of minimalistic holiday events, sparse balance changes and belated glitch patches virtually all of the content this game receives now is heavily monetized and seldom innovative. The game almost never receiving any significant new features. Presumably because the code is so antiquated that adding new features would take inordinate amounts of effort. Or the developers are too lazy to even bother. Each update introduces a new array of ridiculous glitches which further allude to either the instability of its code or the developer's incompetence, resulting in a perpetual cycle of broken gameplay elements which randomly softlock players and force entire pieces of content to be temporarily disabled. One character was disabled for an entire month recently.


From the perspective of a survivor this game can be enjoyable, enough so that it often serves as a reasonable diversion, however this massively depends on a wide variety of factors which after nearly a decade should really be resolved by now. Between the endless glitches, awful perk balancing, clearly slanted role balancing, uncoordinated yet team-centric gameplay and the abundance of ways in which the murderer can make survivors miserable this game is atrocious from a critical standpoint; its random glorification of murder and schadenfreude being particularly repugnant. 

Yet if players want a chase-driven gameplay experience that actually has a decent amount of players and support there are few other options beyond this game; which is ultimately its main redeeming facet.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As much as I love to play this game, I had to uninstall. I'm not coming back.

For the record, I was a Survivor Main.
We all know this is a 1v4 game. The issue? Too many toxic killers that I've come across that don't play fair for me to enjoy it. That's my main issue. I get it though, survivors are and can be just as bad.

The second bone to pick I've got is the double standard.
Prime Example: Survivors have a perk called ""Made For This"" that allowed you to run 3% faster while injured. They changed that to 3% in a Deep Wound state. In one of my matches, I came across a Trapper that had nothing but 5% haste perks. I could NOT run the killer no matter how hard I tried.

The third issue that I've had with this game is literally getting stuck on NOTHING. A part of a hill and getting stuck on it. Getting stuck on a wall. Stuck on a corner of something.. Etc.

4. The block button should be considered to take people that don't play fair (i.e. Slugging, Camping, Tunneling (and it's been nothing but the entire match)) out of YOUR matchmaking. Much like for example you can't see someone you blocked in a game due to harassment. That's not the case in this game. It just blocks communication. So no matter what, you could be stuck with the same killer 3 times in a row if you're that unlucky. 

5. This game is constantly.. and I mean CONSTANTLY precariously balanced imho. BHVR devs don't even play their own game to know what they're doing. This game makes people angry. It makes ME angry. They allow atrocious behavior to persist despite all the complaints. They FINALLY implemented a camp meter (can't remember when) so you can get off of the hook but that doesn't do jack considering they can STILL camp out of range and come back to the hook to tunnel you out.

Lastly, as much as this can be fun and everyone's being fair (and you're playing with friends).. I have encountered those who'd rather ruin your day moreso in the last 3 years than when I first played this in 2018. I still miss the match I had with a Wraith that knew what he was doing. He scared the daylights out of me lol. He played with all of us like we were his food.

I don't want to be angry anymore when it comes to this game. It's tiresome trying to find a good match that's fun on a game that ruins itself every time they release a Killer. I don't blame it, I blame the people operating it.",1560929266,1707187621,False,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

EDIT: While I still cherish the time I've spent with friends in this game, I cannot in good conscience keep a recommended review of a game from a dogshit company. Their laziness and idiocy has been proven time and time again and they refuse to do anything competent about it. ""Anti-Camping"" measures were made without any consideration to ranged killers nor any other factors that affect this. You can still get camped regardless of any change BHVR made to the game because they couldn't even keep track of simple differences in killers. ""Ah yes, lets make a universal change for anti-camping that doesn't change depending on the killer nor how the current state of the game is."" Bullshit, they only made the change because people were complaining for so long and so loud that they had to make something to shut them up, not because they understand the players grievances with the game. So now even if people continue to bitch about campers they'll have a defense for such claims since they technically did something. Nothing about the game is fixed and it will not get better. They are leeches, and I suggest anyone interested in this game to steer far clear from buying it.

The more you try to leave it be, the harder it is. It's an amazing museum of horror classics but the execution is just awful. I've been a passionate player for over 3 years now and the more I play, the more it feels like I'm an addict looking for his midnight fix.

Don't get me wrong: the game is gorgeous but the community is just a clusterfuсk. There's no way you can get enjoyment or fun at high ranks since even most of the high ranking players promote the boring ways of playing such as tunneling or BuckleUp+ForThePeople.

Bullying. The game feels like a safe haven for bullies and bullied people: the only other game I know where a similar keyboard courage can be observed is Dota 2 and you know the Dota community. It's just baffling how people on the other end of the screen make their top priority to ruin someone else's day. The worst of all is that this kind of behavior is being installed to new players which means that hate grows from the very start.

Now most people who read this will think that it's my own fault, why are you playing then?

d because of the killer I am facing or how poor any match has gone but now forced to be punished out of playing this game because others in the past have dc'd for no reason.

-Update 8/01/23: Its difficult to notice, but i am already sure there are ppl using hacks lately. (Killers that move a little faster, skill wheels faster too,..) not sure if its about hacks or ping problems, but have seen it in some trials.

An  asymmetrical game, relevant by the use of  positional audio and how important it can be. A lot of games center on graphics (in this game are gorgeous) and forget the possibilities of the audio as an actor. About how the match  progresses there are some things that could be better, like the balance of power,  ITS BAD LEVELED and no pure stealth as survivor, the killer with some perks knows where u are. 
The finals of some  trials with 1 or 2 survivors,  why last survivors loose the 3 opportunities to get off the hook, sometimes the 2 doors appear too close, details i think are important to improve it.

The ranking is shit, in public trials u will have to trust in luck, not your abilities just to get a  0. Will have serious problems and will need a lot of luck just to get +1. (As survivor),  It crashes a lot and u loose the progress of an afternoon in a second. Meh, :P

The main problem with this game is the fact that developers refuse to change the core mechanics. They merely attempt to patch problems (they've done this for years) and release new cosmetics/killers/survivors/bugs/crashes. 

[h2]Gameplay Issues...[/h2]
Although they do target problems with the core gameplay such as 3gening, camping and tunneling, all of these are still [b]very[/b] present in the game. If anything they've made it even better to tunnel by adding and buffing slowdown perks that make it easy to win a 3v1 (especially on stronger killers). Fundamentally, the only way a killer can win is by either snowballing (downing survivors fast enough), playing dirty (camping/tunneling/etc) or by bringing plenty of slowdown perks. A combination of the last two are by far the most common; especially at higher MMR, and/or weaker killers. 

[h2]RNG[/h2]
While this game isn't riddled with RNG, some are really frustrating; sometimes survivors end up with most generators in really save areas, or in complete dead zones. There's also stupid RNG, such as gens blowing up (and losing progress) when a survivor leaves it (7% chance or w/e).

[h2]Survivor Solo Queue...[/h2]
Most of the games in solo queue are terrible, with survivors suiciding early, making stupid mistakes (letting the killer snowball), etc. The difference between solo queue and a SWF (survive with friends) is huge. I'd suggest playing with others, otherwise this will likely drive you nuts (at least if you want to win, and not just goof around like some content creators such as JRM). 

[h2]Bugs...[/h2]
With each patch we see game servers crashing, clients crashing, and other interesting bugs (killers getting stuck, killers power bugging out, perks not working, survivors/killers able to enter unreachable locations, etc). Some of these bugs have been in the game for long, and end up being dubbed ""techs"", such as window techs, slide techs, etc. Often a patch arrives, and on the same day, or the day after some content is blocked cause of a bug. 

[h2]Developers...[/h2]
The developers don't really listen to advice, and mostly follow their own studies (which is frustrating; see rants from content creators for this game, e.g. Otzdarva). E.g. they still haven't done anything about nurse (who ignores every chase mechanic in the game), even though there are players with thousands of wins in a row on that killer. 

[h2]High MMR...[/h2]
First of all, there isn't really a ""high MMR"" in this game, since you reach the MMR cap fairly quickly. 
Gameplay on higher MMR is mostly just an armsrace of perks/items/addons. A game can be over in 2-3 minutes if survivors bring the strongest stuff, and similarly if the killers bring the strongest stuff. Which is why these are banned in tournaments (see DBDLeague).

[h2]Balance...[/h2]
The balance in this game is quite horrible, some killers are completely busted, such as nurse, spirit and blight. When you end up against a really good killer playing one of these, you'll know. Unless you're in a SWF that's prepared for it, you'll almost always lose. Then there's killers like Freddy and Trapper who can lose even if they outplay the survivors. There's also a world of difference between the strongest and weakest addons/perks. There's perks that basically don't do anything useful, and those that are busted. As a killer you'll likely end up hating second chance perks, such as adrenaline, unbreakable, for the people, buckle up, dead hard, decisive strike etc. As a survivor you'll end up hating certain playstyles, such as 3gening, camping & tunneling, along with slowdown perks. Especially those that completely block you from progressing.

[h2]Slow Progression...[/h2]
Unless you plan on spending thousands of hours on this game (like me) expect to spend 100+ EUR on DLCs for the game, and even then you still need hundreds of hours to unlock the content you bought (which is kinda mindblowing). There's plenty of content creators talking about this issue, just search on youtube. 

[h2]Learning Curve...[/h2]
Further, expect to spend hundreds, if not thousands of hours in the game before you learn killers mechanics, maps, perks, addons, etc. There's hundreds of perks, 35 killers, each with 15-20 addons, 22 maps each with multiple different layouts, etc. Expect to be a beginner until you have upwards of 1k hours in the game.

[h2]TLDR;[/h2]

In this game, stealth is key ! The heart-pounding stealth required from survivors mirrors the art of slipping through the cracks, a skill Roy and I hone when avoiding office gatherings. Well, actually we don't really need to avoid those as we are usually not invited to said gatherings. 

Playing a killer can also be fun and relatable as you feel like turning into one every time Daniel from the 7th floor makes fun of your glasses... PLOPPER !

Anyway. What is actually more relatable is playing a survivor because, let's be honest, we all feel like survivors in the office sometimes...

In conclusion Dead by Daylight is a great game. It might not be flawless, but then again, neither is troubleshooting a legacy system. I'd give it a solid 4 out of 5 IT tickets.

3- I reported a Dwight who was spamming incomplete unhook for straight 1 minute until he unhooked me, even that wasn't enough, he brought the killer to me and pointed me to him with flashlight, I recorded the whole match, I thought this video evidence is more than enough to ban a sore loser but guess what? he's currently in DBD
It's like I'm playing DBD the wrong way and what they did is the right way of playing DBD
I sent my videos to the head of BHVR aka M Cote and I checked the trolls profile and he was playing DBD
I gave up on that, then I took a break for months and came back after they released chucky, 3 match in a row as killer I faced try hards and lost all of them, 4th match when I was about to secure 2k, servers just crashed & kicked me to main menu with 5 minutes penalty
I made a thread about it and said ""What kind of shit show is this? why am I playing with sweatlords after a long break?""
I got instant banned  for 1 month because I said ""shit show""
After that I came back & made a thread talked about how useless the report system is, even with evidence & a few hours later I got a message that I permanently banned from DBD community hub just because at the start of the thread I pointed that ""1 month ban""
BHVR and DBD moderator! I wish for you the worsts

Now let's talk about the game itself
This overgrown meme game never meant to be this popular, very undeserved

Graphic: Early PS3 era

Gameplay: Survivor can run & Crouch, Killer can Run and Swing weapon, that's pretty much it (Mobile level)

Music: Only good part of the game

Community: The worst community ever, game's main FUN is BMing the other players, as long as you successfully ruining other people's life & laughing at them like a crazy maniac, you're the winner

Animations: It looks like they just randomly hired people from streets & taught them the basics, &  congratulations, you're the animator now

Voice acting: Random BHVR employer goes Aaaaaaaaaaaa, that's it

They just luckily made something new that blew up, after that there's nothing creative about this game, it took'em 7 years to fix face camping not to mention this game still has no new game mode, well thanks to crossovers they're still living, & I don't really call a game good just because they have a good roster, the cheapest way to make their games popular, you don't need to be a genius to know which character is popular, let the game be broken & unfun the licensed chapters will fool'em for quite a while
Let me explain how they managed to get away with it:
""
BHVR Employer 1: Game is broken, everyone's complaining, if we don't do something they'll leave, what should we do?

BHVR Employer 2: Hmmm... Nicolas Cage, let's get him

BHVR Employer 1: SMART
""

No game should do this but it's addicting. Yet BHVR doesn't want to fix basic things in the game that the community has problems with until they start getting hate. They cant even make their updates better. Take the ""Anti Camp Update"" for example. It doesn't work as well as you think they just go a little farther and boom, no anti camp progression. A billion dollar corporation doesn't have people play test their own game.
Thus leads to horrible imbalance between both sides. Now lets go back to the dlc part, paying to win is a thing but it's usually looked down upon. Not in this game because you HAVE TO BUY THE DLC TO HAVE FUN IN THE GAME. Fun should be accessible at all times not locked behind a digital pay wall. Yet i still bought all dlc for this game. Spending $200 on them for digital fun. For that money I could take my friend (imaginary) on a concert, or go ahead and have dinner with them or something. What im trying to say is the developers don't know what they're doing and or don't play test their own game, and the horrible imbalance due to you having to buy dlc to get the perks that come along with the dlc, but certain perks are out right meta locked behind digital pay walls forcing you to buy them to be in check with the killer. Not only does it rake in money for the devs but they wont fix it for the last reason I just said.
Yet I still play the game regularly because I did buy all dlc and was happy with it until I came to the conclusion that im making this review. This game was a lot more entertaining in the first 15 or so game you played.",1699589484,1707056792,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game was really fun, on both modes, but the current state of the game, with survivors hacking it all the time, crashing the killer with ddos attacks to avoid getting killed or even getting the hook, it just ruined the game. The game does not properly mask you and those attacks are quite frequently and just happen with this game. The developers are aware of this, since streamers were also target by it, but they don´t care. AVOID THIS GAME.

2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The crazy amount of hacking has dimished, but the way the game changed, mas not for the better. Is far from an horror game and is now a joke. Survivor run the place without fear of killers and they don´t even have to hack as much anymore. 

2023

____________________________________________________________

Game keep going downhill. Recent changes just make tunneling even a more jutified strategy and the new DLC is the most useless yet, followed by several DLCs which mainly give of take away speed (haste). The Survivor community is more than ever hyper toxic, specially outside US/English speaking zones. Avoid.

Game is like hide and go seek and/or blind man's bluff, but it gets repetitive as there's only one gameplay mode: 

- fix the total amount of generators before the killer kills everyone or escape by hatch or exit 
  gate as the lone survivor.

Pros:

- Constant and different challenges/quests to complete 
- Multiple Characters to choose from
- There's Lore/Stories about the characters you play
- Free Cosmetics and 10$ Premium Rifts
- Quality of Life Updates: Bloodweb instant selection and Increase Blood Point Bonuses

Cons: 

- Online Multiplayer Only (Internet required)

- Unexpected Gameplay.  Pallet Saves are broken and instead of saving the survivor on the 
  shoulder of the killer, the killer is unaffected.  The pallet save turns into a free off the 
  shoulder for the survivor who tried to do the pallet save?  Take this as a grain of salt, but 
  apparently ""The Entity"" may have played a part in this.  But, this sounds more like an excuse 
  for bad gameplay design.

- Crossplay games, most survivor/killer players disconnect and are penalized for 
  disconnecting. Instead of penalizing players they should be innovating ways 
  to keep players in the game

- No Ultra Widescreen support

- Inventory/Perks Menu needs better filters.  They're only ordered alphabetically, recognition 
  by pictures and can be only searched by inputting texts for a search filter (if you know what you're looking 
  for)

- Sync issues with Killer/Survivor (ie, Pallet Stuns but the Survivor still gets hit or Vaulting and 
  still getting hit)

- Unstable Servers caused by Owner/Admin leads to disconnects and extended wait time no matter the 
  reason.  The only resolution is to restart the game and inability to rejoin and continue the session",1595215517,1707035987,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Imagine a mechanic for survivors that if they gen rush, the entity blocks the hooked survivor for a limited time for prioritizing gens over their team.

This is a strategy game, not a horror game. Though the devs only partially realize that. If you go watch DbD youtube videos or twitch streams you won't see people with face cams screaming, instead they're using counterstrike style call outs and doing cost-benefit analysis on every action they do in the game.

DbD is full of grinding, and that kills horror games. When you've done something a hundred times and memorized all the stats it stops being scary. DbD has so much grinding and so many microtransactions that it's basically a free mobile game except it costs $20. With all of the licensed dlc in the game it's basically fortnite and the devs have given more attention to cosmetics than actual gameplay.

I have no idea how looping has stayed in the game this long but it seems the devs don't actually play the game anymore and just look at stats to make balance changes. Honestly I can't blame them for it. The community is toxic af and super competitive. There's no way to play the game casually besides invite-only private lobbies. Ranked mode is the only way to play and god help you if you play survivor alone. Surprisingly there's no voice chat in game for survs, not even text chat, just 2 emotes, that's it. Despite this playing with friends still gives you a massive advantage bc Discord calls exist letting survs coordinate extremely well.

Despite all this DbD is very addicting bc it drips feeds you just enough rewards and the gameplay has enough variety and depth to keep you coming back.",1707001765,1707001765,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is good and I really like it, but you always try to jump higher than you can. Stop doing new chapters, survs, killers, perks and fix existing bugs in the game. Since the Binding of Kin released you lose more of your community because of that. For instance after previous chapter was released and I couldnt play because of some sort of bug, where I was kicked out of loading screen with some sort of crash. Gladly it was fixed. Since the new chapter came out I cant play again, because of EAC error, which nobody know how to fix. Why do you need it though, because cheaters slice into the game anyway? There are much more questions and troubles to discuss about, but what's the point, If nobody want to fix it and consider only about making money...

UPD: After solving the problem (myself) thanks to which I couldn't start the game and playing few more hour I would like to add, that when you play killer, most of the times you will get try hard guys which bully that shit out of you and everybody uses second chance perks If you wanna play normal killer(not Frieddy, Nurse, Spirit etc). But If you start to play survivor, you get a bunch of clown dying after 30 sek. 
New map reworks made chases longer because it is possible to see a killer milles away from places where gens are spowned.
End as I mentioned, you get stuck on every invisible collition while being both killer and survivor.

The one thing that I'd really change about this game is adding more of a system to punish killers for tunneling/camping. The system now is great, but toxic killers are still able to find ways to get around the camping system to where fellow survivors aren't able to unhook a player without them getting killed as well. I would also love a little more customization for some of the characters that doesn't involve spending more shards (the free currency you can spend on characters). When you spend shards on characters they don't come with any other hairstyles or clothing options besides the one outfit, this was the case at least when I bought Yui, Jane, and Felix.
    The community is mostly very wholesome and silly, and I would say there are less toxic people than most games, but of course there's always going to be a portion of the community who are. There is also a large part of the community that are part of the lgbtqia+ community (we love the gays <3) and I haven't ran into any problems with homophobia so far in the game. 
TLDR: If you're looking into buying Dead by Daylight, I highly recommend it! Lots of laughs, a wholesome, fun, and accepting community, a little bit toxic but not as toxic as other games I've played.",1706990809,1706990809,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

At 1,700 i still don't like this game, but I like playing with friends, so I'm basically stuck in hell

at 1,200 hours the game becomes more toxic and the flaws become more and more hard to ignore. I only play because some friends have fun gaming together, but this game has no real fun left.   The game has no mechanic to penalize all the toxic behavior and it becomes tiresome to deal with non stop toxic B.S.    I don't say this ligtly, but the worst online community.  On top of that, a buggy game, a horrific grind system.  Fun can be found, but you have to enjoy being shit on most of the time to hope for that 1 or 2 fun games inbweeen tons of very unfun games. 


Now at almost 1,000 hours I would still say the game is still mostly fun, but still very much flawed.  It is fun to play with friends, but it is poorly balanced, has a surprising amount of bugs, toxic community and the to unlock all the perks, get ready to grind, grind grind.   I still keep this as a positive review, but honestly, its one more poor update from going to a negative review.

review at 150ish hours
Game is mostly Good. It is fun, but flawed.  matchmaking is very poor, and that can be a pain in the ass.   The dynamic of being chased by a killer or hunting a survivor is a LOT of fun.    The game gets a get unbalanced when survivors play in  group in a chat program like discord, because no skill in the game can manage to handle good communcation. 


I play both killer and survivor, and have fun with both, but this game is tilted toward survivor, especially at higher ranks",1602901779,1706938957,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

From custom games with friends to playing online as killer/survivor, I've had my fair share of good times. The gameplay loop is shockingly addictive and the roster of characters is well fleshed out, from cool original creations like the embodiment of darkness itself The Dredge, to licenses like Chucky and Pyramid Head, each fleshed out well enough so that every killer feels fun to play with their own playstyle. With all these positives, I would love to recommend this game, but I can't inherently do that in the game's current state.

Dead by Daylight has one of the worst new player experiences I've ever experienced. It's irritating that if you want to start lasting more than 2 minutes online as you climb the ranks, you need to brush up on Killer and Survivor Perks, Addons, Items, Maps, Looping Strategies, etc. On top of that, a lot of the perks you can earn for free are arbitrary or passable at best. The issue there is that most of the perks that would WILDLY assist newer users are locked behind paid DLC, that could cost between $5-$20. Even then, it takes at least a little ""grinding"" after that, because perks start at level 1 and need to be leveled up to level 3 through the Bloodweb progression system, which could take a couple of games or days of on and off playing. All this culminates in a skill floor that is disastrously high, and if we're being honest, a lot of people don't have the free time to invest anywhere from 60-200 hours to learn the ins and outs of a video game. Trying to teach friends this game has been frustrating at best, because I see them die early and quickly and it sucks knowing that the only advice I could give is to cough up more money or watch Otz videos and commit to playing DBD often.

Along with all those issues, the player base can't be ignored. While I don't agree with the notion that it's one of the worst communities (In fact, plenty of small-big content creators are an incredibly positive force for good and have welcomed hundreds of kind people into the fanbase) it certainly isn't welcoming. For one, both sides have a set of made-up honor rules, molded around the idea of allowing people to have enough fun but not throwing away ""winning"" in the process. The issues arises in the fact that they are **made up** so there is never a surefire way to avoid being yelled at, because a survivor will complain that you targeted them too much one game while a killer will complain that you rushed the objective too fast the next, leading to a frustrating dynamic where someone is always mad. Additionally, it's very common to have players disconnect or intentionally die, as there are very surefire methods to do so due to certain game mechanics. The devs have added AI to replace players who disconnect, and while a nice band-aid, still doesn't address the issue at large, with a high amount of intentionally dying on hook, removing the option of getting a bot in place of the player. Not to mention all these make the already bad Solo queue experience worse, since there is no ping or comms system in DBD aside from 2 emotes, preventing solo survivors from communicating with their teammates in times of need.

Lastly (speaking of the developers) I can't ignore the stumbles from BHVR. To be optimistic, the balance/QoL changes have been increasing in quality lately, with accessibility changes and gameplay adjustments, but that comes with the a LARGE asterisk. Updates take a while, usually 3 months, and historically the devs are slower to pressing balance changes, leading perks or characters to potentially be downright busted for 3 months. Characters like The Blight or The Nurse have been S+ tier pretty much since they came out, with seemingly little to no acknowledgement from BHVR. Additionally, map design recently has been dodgy. Maps can be huge, with lots of physical clutter sneezed across the level, or long with countless hallways and doorways and small pallets, guaranteeing going down in certain areas in you're unlucky. As pessimistic as it is, BHVR seem to address these issues by slapping duct tape over the hole, while releasing yet another skin pack despite having the tools to permanently improve overall game quality for everyone. 

All of that said, I still do enjoy the game. If I could put a ""mixed"" instead of recommend/don't recommend I would, because DBD can be and still is fun, and I do think the game is worth giving a shot. If you don't mind investing in the learning curve I say go for it, as some of the stated issues become secondary to personal experience past the barrier to entry. Aside from that though, with pressing issues still needing solutions and a poor new player experience, DBD is a flawed game with a very fun game floating around somewhere inside it.

The game itself is fun but both sides survivor and killers feel entitled to win at times so they make up their own rules. “You can’t run decisive strike!” “You can’t run noed!” “Nooo you can’t shine a flashlight in my eyes!” “Nooo you can’t chase me if I’m right off the hook even though I ran into you and gave you a free hit then ran into a dead zone noooo!” It’s just kinda annoying.

(560 hrs) Coming back to this review because I initially wrote it while I was ignorant to just how deep this game goes. Learning that has also allowed me to gleam what I think is the primary source of people's rage in dbd: failure to adapt. This is a game with an incredibly high skill ceiling, and many people simply hit a wall at some point and blame it on either toxic players or bad game design. The truth is that as long as you stay flexible and passionate about playing your respective role: you will prosper.

The developers update their game about as much and as often as minecraft does (with as much depth added, might I add), and since when this game came out it was kind of simple, now you need to know of about 70-100 perks for killers OR survivors (OR you need to know BOTH if you want to play with an advantage when it comes to outplaying and taking advantage of certain situations). and know 30ish killers' kits, which 1/3 to 1/2 are trapper level: Simple and can be explained, seen or played several times and you know everything there is to know of it (minus the best strategy). Some kits just outright write a novella that detail nothing well-defined like pinhead/cenobite.

I really don't suggest picking up this game.

If you truly enjoy the game still that's great you should be able to enjoy the game, but for me and mostly how a good chunk of players feel is boredom, and even if we get a new Asym it won't matter because players will find a way to break/meta cheese there way to victory instead of playing for fun. Which will in turn make said game lose players. VHS, Last Year, TCM, all have had these problems. Some die because they just don't get updates I'm aware of that but for the most part if players gave said games a chance we would still maybe just maybe have them still today.

Never forgive never forget the hillbilly ""rework"" that took almost 4 years to fix lol. Idk, hard to be passionate anymore, not happy about it, gonna prob change my review again later but couldn't leave that 2017 glowing review up anymore after looking at it lol. Here it is for old times sake so you can see how far we've come haha

""Asymmetrical games are an untapped source of online potential. Dead by Daylight is by a longshot the best of the genre to date, beating all past and current competition, namely in bang for your buck fun, core gameplay mechanics and continued support from the devs. The main complaints I and my friends who I play with are all about balancing, which is something that has been (in my opinion) tuned well enough to award players for skill without too many curtches (but I have to admit, the survivor team does have a fair share of crutches compared the the killers few). A great Horror Game experience for one team, and a great Killer experience for the other. Dead By Daylight has become my most played game and one that I continue to want to come back to after every session. Highly recommend, don't be deterred by reviews focused on balance issues.

Situation: killer hunts and destroy generators, some ''survivor'' tilts hunter to run after, if u ignore him he will sit in damn doors blocking u to get hit on another ''survivor'', who is repairing, while another runs after u each time flashing by lights if u pick anyone up or throwing out Long fokin gone chinese new year sparkles... and what do 4 survivor do by that time? makes damn totems that makes them undownable.... and loops around ''magically'' reseted pallet that was breaked already until stuns killer and even if killer gets anyone down others either bodyblock or combine bodyblock while another one flashes killer.... 

Worst thing is those perks now that makes game unplayable... I hope dbd returns to where it was 2018... without these perks that basically is now bullying killer..

Oh and fun fact, even if killer will get all 4 ''hunters'' those fuks will accuse killer of historical war events... in russian language, or make fun after game about ''noob'' or so, this game drives directly now to place where league of legend community is : toxic with changed roles.... then better play that hunt:showdown than this, because dbd is now basically 4 hunters abusing one killer....

Till 2018 Game was with success in future , Now its worse than friday 13, where killer just gets bullied by players where one person is ''they/them'' nice one... 

Buy game only if u dont have place where to waste cs go skin money like me....

2023 edit : 
Game is regressing , and well humans seems deevolving , why? Game is based on killing survivor, while in same time everyone dress in rainbows ... like some pony land, next thing is actual cheating - and best is that you cant call discord usage for game , where is ingame comms added, cheating because its ok that 4 survivors has 4 perks each + they make useless aura perks by giving each other location of killers , and when you ask this in steam forum game devs blocks you for ''unsportsman behaviour'' while those 4 survivors hapily continues to abbuse killer by looping around... At this point avoid this game at all cost and never buy it... this game is like from hero to zero in these years...",1509570851,1706722534,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is more a neutral review more - neither great, neither bad kinda thing.

I had a lot of fun playing the game(both as the killer and the survivor).
I could go into details but I had two major issues with the game:
1. I got the infamous two killer bug/3 survivors (they should iron this out asap on the PC version);
2. If you get disconnected from the game you lose all blood-points from the match (almost every online game has a tracking system that allows you to keep the rewards of your progress even though you got disconnected - see WoT for example);
3. Waiting time for matches (the wait can go up to 20 mins).

While fun at times, there are serious issues with the game that will impact your experience. The execution is sloppy from here and there(collision detection/hitboxes). I get that it's going for the look and not for the functionality. And from an online game that is 6 years old by now, it's unacceptable. Fix your game, give your customers a good experience, and start ironing-out your bugs.

DON'T RECOMMEND to buy it!

Game currently is at the point where normally is ''beta'' test end.. (unfortunately this game is released already for months..)
This game have huge list of issues
* matchmaking taking too long in some regions (need to change download regions.. to fix it, but doing so - there's a lags witch you cant escape)
* in game, some killers are too OP, some very weak..
* toxic community, crying all over the forum about op etc
* releasing DLC's witch is unfortunately PAID.. witch means some of the killers/survivor's upcoming wouldn't be available for all.. skins etc..
* small community.. like average day about 17k players

all in all i still playing it.. just because the grind.. AND the grind is MASSIVE..

don't recommend to buy it at the moment, but wait for some discount or some free weekend to try it out

Some for the good but mostly for the bad. It hurts me to write this, because i've loved this game with all my heart but i'd still like to give my honest opinion too.

Devs don't care - why? Things nobody was asking for get changed while the real problems like bugs being in the game for YEARS literally have no priority. I could go even further into this but it would be a veeeery long review (even longer than it is right now).
Besides all that, the community is very toxic after all. I lost count of how many times i got told to k*ll myself or being insulted for my nationality just because someone didn't liked the way i played, doesn't matter on which side i played on. It also took them 6 YEARS to actively do something against cheaters (and there are still many many out there).

They are trying to change the game to make it more appealing to either role, but sadly don't think that through. Buffing/nerfing certain Killers unnecessarily while others don't get touched at all. Just like Perks (on either side) being totally fine over years but have to be changed now because they want to ""change the meta"" only creating a new, even more annoying meta (movement speed meta, endurance meta, gen rushing/kicking/slowdown/regression meta).

Right now the perks, mostly survivor perks, lack creativity. The game got Perks which literally do the exact same but slightly changed being better or worse. Also you've got little to no killer variety, if you like to play as and against the same 3 Killers out of 34 different ones, good for you, but you won't see any other killers beside Wesker, Chucky or Blight at this point of the game. 

Coming back to the Players: The playerbase right now is having a competitive mindset, meaning they'll do ANYTHING it takes to win the game, leaving casual players who don't play the game 8-12 hours a day, not being able to have an actual chill and fun game without getting ripped apart every round over and over again.

Someday i may come back and write a different review, but for now that's how i feel about a game which brought me joy (and sometimes tears) over many many years, breaking my heart watching the game slowly dying because of the incompetence of the devs and toxicity of the community.

Go ahead DBD community and do your thing with only being able to say ""skill issue"" whenever someone actually points out the problems of the game right now, i know y'all can't take criticsm <3",1706571722,1706572008,False,4,0,0.5356636643409729,0,True,False,False

I also have a love-hate relationship with this game. The current main problem is that Killers feel like they have to camp or tunnel to win the game. If they're going against a SWF (survivor with friends), they are not wrong.

DBD is trying to balance around two completely different situations. One is survivors playing grouped up with comms and another is a group of 4 strangers. What DBD has done to try to alleviate this is to add  more HUD information so survivors can see some of the things other survivors are doing. For example, you can see which survivors are on gens and if another survivor is being chased by the killer. 

These HUD changes have fundamentally broken the game. I'm a survivor main and I dislike these changes. I used to love the horror element of this game. The Killer could be coming towards at any moment. You just didn't know. It was constant fear to look around as much as you can, but also staying on the gen. Or having to rescue a survivor on the hook, without knowing what the other survivors were doing.

What has happened on the game with these HUD info changes, is that Killers now camp or tunnel more than ever. I would say it's at last 67% of the games are a Killer who camps or tunnels. I can't even get mad at them because I know if they go against a good group of survivors, this is the only way to win. I used to play Killer on the regular, but I stopped because it's not fun playing Killer when you feel you have to camp or tunnel. 

I like the chase. I like the horror element. I feel like those parts of the game are now illusory. If you put on a good chase, the Killer will stop chasing you or disconnect. If a survivor goes down fast, the survivor is likely to disconnect. 

The fundamental problem of DBD are grouped up survivors with comms. They will communicate where the Killer is. They will work together in unison, speed-rushing the gens. They will work together to bully the Killer with flashlight saves. The Killer must camp or tunnel to have a chance at winning. The game is semi-balanced around this concept. A good Killer who camps or tunnels will go against a good SWF who will gen-rush. 

It makes playing a solo survivor almost unbearable. Many matches with disconnects. Match will be an easy 3k/4k for the Killer or an easy escape, with only a few balanced matches. But yet, there is no horror. There are no epic chases. The solution is obvious, but it will never be implemented. Put SWFs in a different game mode. The main mode of DBD should be 4 strangers with no external comms (in-game voice proximity chat would be cool though) against a Killer. That's the horror. That's the game with one chase that can win a game. Devs can then make changes that disincentivize camping / tunneling. Get rid of all the HUD info too, except maybe add Kindred base-kit to stop camping / tunneling.",1503296296,1706515576,True,5,1,0.537697732448577881,0,True,False,False

It can be enjoyable with friends for a while, but I lasted about 11 hours (with friends). In general, it is an average game that is extremely boring after a while.

- claudette tries to hide, instead of doing a gen. her teammate (jake) tells her to do the gen instead of hiding.
- claudette works on the gen but is wanting to hide, so she walks away to try and hide and is punished for her actions (gets downed and hooked)
- jake sticks the gen because he knows objectives need to be completed, even if the killer is right there (he can't run anywhere and killer likely has NOED)
- jake is punished for his teammates' mistakes, getting downed while another teammate is on the hook (bad situation)
- gigachad dwight stares down the killer (instead of unhooking the non-gen doing claudette, probably looking for a locker)

Ingredients
6 green bell peppers

salt to taste

1 pound ground beef

⅓ cup chopped onion

salt and pepper to taste

1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped

½ cup water

½ cup uncooked rice

1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup

water as needed

Directions
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the tops off bell peppers and remove the seeds. Cook bell peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes; drain. Sprinkle salt inside each bell pepper and set aside.

Place ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Drain off excess fat and season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, rice, and Worcestershire sauce; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cheese.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Stuff each bell pepper with beef and rice mixture; arrange open-side up in a baking dish.

Combine tomato soup with just enough water in a medium bowl to make the soup a gravy consistency; pour over the bell peppers and cover with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly, about 25 to 30 minutes. (this game sucks)",1702049390,1706500916,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However, after over 1000 hours, my general opinion is: Behavior will continue to buff and nerf everything into oblivion to the point where you have to keep up with how your various abilities change. There is a pretty large learning curve, because each killer is different. It helps to play as killer and survivor, to know the killers weaknesses. The amount of continued development is something the player has to keep up with. There are so many killers and ability changes now, that if you take a break, you have to catch up on how everything has changed. Keeping up with the killers, the changes, the metas, and everything like that is sort of key to being S tier at this game. It is a very good game.

The killer has far too much control/ power over how enjoyable a round is and they tend to play toxic by camping/ tunnelling making it really boring and predictable.

Another reason I don't recommend the game is because there are many aspects of the game that devs refuse to fix and havent fixed for years now including dodgy hit boxes and the fact killers can hit you through the other side of a pallet which is one of the only counter plays survivors have. Nurse is also very broken and hasn't been addressed yet.

Finally the community is awful and gets way too heated and toxic over a game.

it properly takes at least 100 hours just to get a grip on a majority of what the game can throw at you, what tools you can use, and how gameplay is understood on both killer and survivor. i would reccomend going in with friends and expecting frustration at times where not understanding how a character works or what powers do what be expected if you want to try jumping in.

Killers are way too Over Power and Survivors have nothing to figth back. Things get worse when you have to face killers who stay in front of you once you're hooked, or when you just want to die and he refuses to kill you and leave you bleeding forever on the ground. But it can get even worse because as a survivor you can get penalized/banned for a while if you abandon a game where the killer is a total idiot as described above. 
Besides all that there are a lot of killer that can put you down with one single hit.

UPDATE 09/11/2022: Once you manage to prestige your survivor (reach level 50),  his perk can be share with the rest of survivor which ingrese a lot your chances of getting out alive.


UPDATE 24/11/2022: Too many hackers.

 the community can be a real opinionated pain in the ass, and the game is constantly adding new perks and characters that can change the dynamic of the game drastically, creating an odd friction between killers and survivors and normally one side or the other will pretty much just say the game is unbalanced and its because of (insert new killer/perk/items/ETC.) 

now is the game FUN!?! yes (IMO) it has tons of content and is clearly one of the biggest horror games of all time (or at least horror themed) its got a pretty good progression system that feels rather rewarding in general, the blood web can be a little tedious but not bad by any means

the black eye of this game is definitely the community though...i cant imagine actually trying to pick up this game for the first time with where its at, if you play killer and dont know what youre doing survivors will call you a ""baby killer"", and if you play survivor youre eventually gonna run into killers that are just sweaty as hell...and the end game chat is just terrible honestly, i mean normally i just drop a ""gg"" but some people just explode with frustration and either leave comments on your profile (which is actually pretty funny) or just start shit talking until you leave the match...",1471745985,1706457145,True,3,0,0.545561492443084717,0,True,False,False

The game is full of bugs, glitches, and imbalance. The killers are either too overpowered or too weak, and the survivors are either too smart or too dumb. The matchmaking system is broken, and the servers are laggy and unstable. The graphics are outdated, and the sound effects are annoying. The game also lacks variety and content, and the developers are slow to fix the issues or add new features. The game is not worth the money or the time, and I regret buying it. I do not recommend this game to anyone, unless you enjoy frustration and boredom.

For example, one of the most common bugs is the “hatchet glitch”, where the killer’s throwing weapon goes through walls and hits survivors. This makes the game unfair and frustrating for the survivors, who have no way to avoid it. Another bug is the “infinite loading screen”, where the game gets stuck on the loading screen and never starts. This wastes the players’ time and forces them to restart the game. These bugs have been reported for months, but the developers have not fixed them yet.

The game also suffers from imbalance, as some killers and survivors are much stronger or weaker than others. For instance, the Nurse is widely considered to be the most powerful killer, as she can teleport through walls and obstacles and catch survivors easily. On the other hand, the Clown is regarded as the weakest killer, as he has no mobility or map pressure and his gas bottles are easy to dodge. Similarly, some survivors have perks that give them an unfair advantage, such as Decisive Strike, which allows them to escape the killer’s grasp once per match. Other survivors have perks that are useless or detrimental, such as No Mither, which makes them start the match injured and unable to heal. These imbalances make the game boring and repetitive, as players tend to use the same characters and strategies over and over.

The game also has a poor matchmaking system, which often pairs players with different skill levels or regions. This results in matches that are either too easy or too hard, or that have high ping and lag. The game also has a toxic community, where players often insult, harass, or cheat each other. The game does not have a proper reporting system, and the developers rarely ban or punish the offenders.

The game’s graphics and sound are also outdated and annoying. The game looks like it was made in 2016, which is when it was released. The game has low-resolution textures, bland colors, and poor lighting. The game also has a lot of clipping and collision issues, where characters and objects go through each other or get stuck. The game’s sound effects are also irritating, as they are loud, distorted, and repetitive. The game’s music is also bland and generic, and does not fit the horror theme of the game.

The game also lacks variety and content, as it has only a few maps, modes, and cosmetics. The game has 22 killers and 24 survivors, but most of them are similar or reskins of each other. The game has only 14 maps, which are randomly generated from a pool of tiles. The game has only two modes, which are the standard 4v1 mode and a custom mode where players can set their own rules. The game also has a limited selection of cosmetics, which are mostly recolors or slight variations of the default outfits. The game also charges a lot of money for its DLCs, which often add new characters or cosmetics that are not worth the price.

The game’s developers are also slow to fix the issues or add new features to the game. The game often has long periods of time between patches or updates, and when they do come, they often introduce more bugs or problems than they solve. The game also has a lot of unfulfilled promises, such as cross-play, cross-progression, dedicated servers, and a new ranking system, which have been delayed or canceled. The game also has a lot of wasted potential, as it could have been a great horror game with more creativity, polish, and balance.

In conclusion, Dead by Daylight is a game that I do not enjoy or recommend. It is a game that is full of flaws, frustrations, and boredom. It is a game that does not live up to its premise or potential. I've met many good people on this game such as my gf and friends I thank this game for that and not much else.",1706450969,1706450969,False,7,0,0.539814352989196777,0,True,False,False

Here’s my review of Dead by Daylight:

Title: Heart-Pounding Horror and Intense Showdowns
Gameplay (4/5):
The core gameplay loop in DbD is both simple and addictive. As a survivor, you’ll work with your team to repair generators while avoiding the killer. The tension rises as the heartbeat sound grows louder, signaling the killer’s proximity. The asymmetrical nature keeps matches fresh, and the variety of killers and survivors adds depth.

Graphics and Atmosphere (4.5/5):
DbD excels in creating a spine-chilling atmosphere. The eerie maps, dim lighting, and haunting sound design immerse players in the horror genre. The graphics are solid, although some animations could be smoother.

Killer Variety (4/5):
The roster of killers is diverse, each with unique abilities and playstyles. From the stealthy Wraith to the brutal Leatherface, there’s a killer for every preference. However, balancing issues occasionally arise, affecting the overall experience.

Survivor Experience (3.5/5):
Playing as a survivor can be intense, but it can also feel frustrating. Escaping the killer requires teamwork, but solo queueing can lead to uneven matches. The grind for Bloodpoints (in-game currency) can be time-consuming.

Community and Toxicity (3/5):
DbD’s community can be passionate, but toxicity exists. Some players take the game too seriously, leading to unpleasant interactions. However, finding a friendly group can enhance the experience.

Overall (4/5):
Dead by Daylight delivers heart-pounding moments, whether you’re narrowly escaping a killer’s grasp or landing a clutch save. While it has its flaws, the game’s unique concept and constant updates keep players coming back for more.

Remember, the true horror lies not only in the game but also in the friendships you forge and the adrenaline-fueled matches that leave you breathless. Happy hunting! 🌟🔪🏃‍♂️💀


Title: Shadows and Betrayal in the Fog

Gameplay (3/5):
Dead by Daylight is a gripping dance of survival and deception, but it’s not without its dark corners. Let’s delve into the shadowy realm of cheating.

The Cheaters Among Us:
While most players embrace the game’s challenge, a sinister subset lurks—the cheaters. These elusive individuals exploit glitches, use unauthorized software, or collude with the enemy. Their actions disrupt the delicate balance between survivors and killers, tarnishing the experience for all.

Wallhacks and Aimbots:
Wallhacks grant cheaters X-ray vision, revealing survivor locations through obstacles. Aimbots ensure every shot hits its mark, leaving survivors defenseless. These digital specters haunt the Fog, undermining the game’s integrity.

Community Fallout (2.5/5):
Cheating fractures the community. Trust erodes, and accusations fly like crows disturbed from their roosts. Legitimate players suffer, questioning their allies’ motives. The Fog thickens with suspicion.

Developer Vigilance (4/5):
Behaviour Interactive battles these shadows. Regular updates and anti-cheat measures attempt to cleanse the realm. But like survivors in a desperate chase, they’re always one step behind.

Survivor Resilience (4.5/5):
True survivors adapt. They learn to spot the telltale signs—the killer who always knows their location, the impossible shots. They report, they persevere, and they fight back.

Final Verdict (3.5/5):
Dead by Daylight remains a thrilling experience, but the specter of cheating looms. As we navigate the Fog, let’s remember: honor among survivors, vigilance against the shadows, and a determination to keep the game true.

In the Fog, trust is fragile, and betrayal wears many faces. Will you survive, or will you succumb to the darkness? 🌫️🔍🔪💔


Title: Shadows of Deception: Dead by Daylight’s Anti-Cheat Struggle

Introduction: The Fog Thickens
Dead by Daylight, a game where survival hangs by a thread, is plagued by an insidious force—the lack of a robust anti-cheat system. As players traverse the fog-shrouded realms, they encounter not only killers and fellow survivors but also those who exploit vulnerabilities for their gain.

The Current State: A Fractured Reality
Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC):

Dead by Daylight relies on Easy Anti-Cheat to detect and ban cheaters. While EAC is a step in the right direction, it’s not foolproof.
Some players slip through its grasp, leaving the community vulnerable to their malevolent actions.
Automated Bans:

EAC tracks known hacks and cheats, but it’s a reactive measure. Players suffer before the banhammer falls.
The Fog echoes with frustration as legitimate survivors face unfair odds.
Community Fallout:

Trust erodes like ancient tombstones. Accusations fly, poisoning the once-cohesive community.
Survivors question their allies, wondering if they’re facing a true adversary or a digital phantom.
The Four-Point Plan: A Beacon of Hope
Dead by Daylight acknowledges the darkness and vows to fight back. Their roadmap for anti-cheat measures includes:

Vulnerability Identification:

Intensifying efforts to identify and fix vulnerabilities. The Fog must be free of hidden traps.
Cheater Mitigation:

Curtailing player sniping—those who forcefully join specific lobbies to disrupt matches.
The Fog should be a battleground, not a theater for sabotage.
Community Vigilance:

Encouraging players to report suspicious behavior promptly.
Together, we can cleanse the realm.
Developer Persistence:

Behaviour Interactive, like a determined survivor, won’t rest. Updates and vigilance continue.
The Fog may shift, but so does our resolve.
Conclusion: A Battle Unfinished
In the eternal struggle between light and shadow, Dead by Daylight fights on. As survivors, we adapt, report, and endure. But until the Fog lifts from the cheater-infested corners, our trust remains fragile.

Remember, fellow survivors: honor, resilience, and a watchful eye can pierce even the darkest veil. 🌫️🔍🔪💔",1468337528,1706386222,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

similar to league of legends this is a game designed to ensnare you, drag you into a toxic feedback loop of endorphins and depression, and keep you hooked so you spend more and more money on skins and killers.

this game is objectively pay to win. you either grind for ~35 hours for one character, then grind another 6-12 hours for their perks, all to use them on another character so you can tailor the experience to your liking, or you fork over 5 dollars for a character just to grind 6-12 hours on their perks.

pair this with an uber toxic community, and a gameplay structure designed so that the role of the killer - the role with theoretically more power - is stressful and anxiety inducing, this is a game best avoided.

The concept was amazing and the gameplay was addicting, but over the years it never got consistently better. This idea of ""balance"" on a purely casual game is one of the reasons why, I believe there should be no such thing as a meta and the game should 100% be played how the player wants to play. A meta implies there's a right/strong way to play, which should have NEVER existed in a game like this. The large variety of perks and abilities each side has encourages creativity and experimentation which can never be put into practice because of the simple fact that one thing is significantly better then the other, so you have no reason to ever use your other options because you risk having a game that could be ended very abruptly along with an unfun experience. The developer team behind this game is laughably incompetent and their idea of ""balance"" isn't even at least good. The game is objectively one sided if both sides were pushed to their absolute limits, anyone with over 100 hours will tell you that; survivor queue times take around 10 minutes for a match that could end as quickly as it started. The developer team rarely listens to the community and when they do they choose to listen to the more toxic side of the community. Which, by the way, were created by the team themselves because in any ""competitive"" game, people want to naturally win, some more then others per say, which breeds the toxicity. The team themselves are greedy and care more about the short term health of the game over the long term health. For example the ""Darkness Among Us"" chapter was poorly designed, lazy, had absolutely no inspiration, and suspiciously seemed more like they wanted a killer whom they could make a bunch of simple cosmetics for, that people would want to buy. Even after that catastrophe they seemed to not have learned their lesson.

I myself admit I was once in love with this game, and part of the toxicity it breeds. But over the years as I got older I realized these truths about the game and never want to touch it again. As an older, on and off player of this game I would not recommend this game, or at the very least if you buy it don't give this team any more of your money unless they truly deserve it, which they do not. Go buy left 4 dead 2 or something, it may be old but its sure as hell not a bad game.

If you have taken the time to read this review and are willing to have a reasonable discussion in the comments on why you disagree, you're more then welcome to. But the information I have stated is all true, until changes are made it will remain 100% true.

UPDATE: this review deserves an update and there have been edits in here in there in each paragraph. I'm happy to say the developers HAVE made some wonderful changes since the creation of this review. The grind on the bloodweb has been significantly lessened and the earning of bloodpoints has been multiplied so that the earnings scale to a larger amount over time. Some very problematic perks/offerings have been tuned down or changed entirely so that they cannot be as easily abused as before. During my years playing the game it felt like the developers did not care about the player base or the health of the game, but how much money they could milk before this cash cow was dry. That opinion has changed as it feels like new life has been breathed into it because the community itself responded positively to these changes, therefore everyone naturally has a better experience. 

However the statement that the game is ultimately one sided still remains true but that doesn't matter as much as it once did. One rarely sees super sweat squads that go out of their way to make the killer player have a bad time, and even if you did find a group like that its still manageable because the killer role feels more powerful than before. 2-3 kills or 6-8 hooks is better then nothing and one should be theoretically satisfied with that as they put up a good fight. Although I will say ""competitive"" dbd is an absolute joke to me and if anyone who genuinely plays this game as if it was an e-sport is going out of their way to earn a trophy that doesn't exist. Therefore, competitive dbd teams are a joke, but at least this isn't the only game they play.

One glaring issue that is present 7 years later the map Lampkin Lane, which is unironically the most poorly designed map the game has ever seen and still is even to this day. Unlike literally every other map in the game which follows SOME sort of theme (with the exception of the RPD map), Lampkin throws all of that away and structures its strongest tiles to be literally unplayable for killers unless you're a nurse, or in some cases a hag who can trap it. In this game survivors have pallets and windows to evade the killer and waste their time, windows usually are LESS effective due to them always being available while pallets are stronger but a one time use each. However this map throws all of that away and makes all windows 100% safe with little counter play. Not to mention these windows are littered in EVERY accessible house, each equipped with enough space from each vault to track the killers location to determine which direction they went, and little space in between each window/pallet so that running to a new loop is never a problem. There was a rework for this map that solved players from abusing it through (old) balanced landing about the maps core problems and arguably made it BETTER for survivors because of the numerous fore mentioned windows. A map with a ton of pallets/windows is fair game, its something that all killers will have to deal with eventually (except nurse), but unless the whole killer player population drops what they're doing and plays nurse forever then this map will continue to be an automatic lose for killers. Its wide and open with long sightlines until you enter the house with tight corners and things killers could randomly get stuck on, so not even huntress/deathslinger players will have a good time. Its just to simple for anyone to abuse these overpowered windows and outrun any killer, even casual players can abuse this without a shred of effort or planning. Killers have to go out of their way to do everything they possibly can to do well and generally wont. 
In conclusion, either remove the map entirely or do an extreme overhaul/rework of it. I cannot stress enough how much of a problem this is, even RPD can work against killers and its been done before. Anyone asking ""how do I play Haddonfield as killer?"" would be greeted with ""you don't"", thats the definition of problematic.",1544405176,1706325302,False,2,1,0.53271031379699707,0,True,False,False

1.

But this in most of the instances makes the game unplayable, so you are just waiting there for 10 minutes.[/strike]

2. Chat filter was integrated which does not work in the slightest. It does not catch fuck all of anything in that is not English and get's just about the same amount of false positives as positives. Why is ""Mars"" prohibited? Is there an extraterrestrial life we cannot talk about or what?

3. Why do I need to manually select archives? And when I want to select archives, why does it need to unqueue me?

4. [strike]Why can't there be a button that just dumps selected amount of my 2M bloodpoints into bloodweb? Why do I have to sit here click it?[/strike]

After playing for 1000hours I realized how bad this game actually is..
I really thought only the players are toxic, but in fact the whole DBD staff is as corrupt as the game they are trying to maintain.. maybe that's why actually it's so bad.. 
Due to many many many bugs in the game, I recently tried to express my opinion on DBD forums, on Reddit and on Steam Discussions page, and all of my posts have been deleted for no real reason.. the devs/mods just don't want you to talk negatively about the game, even tho that's the exact state of the game...

GG

Update: So they are also participating in anti consumer friendly practices and daily rewards can be given for characters you don't own, the only way to unlock killers is with money making the game horribly pay to win.

*new* 4/10, the only reason I'm even going to keep playing is to see if the experience improves as I level killers. (it did somewhat but the way matchmaking works ruins the experience, with only 25 some hours I got about 2 hours straight of 1000+ hours survivors rushing gens in under 5 minutes)


Update: (patch 6.7.1) Survivors are still toxic, playing as killer is mechanically fun but the behavior of survivors is stupidly stressful, recently started running into Smurf Accounts (prestige 25 survivors against my prestige 0 killers by joining with their Prestige 0 friend) matchmaking based on old videos was atrocious due to all the broken perks, match making now is atrocious cause of survivors, as their toxicity pushes killers to be Toxic and now we have a unbreakable loop of toxicity in the game, BHVR refuses to address this which would indicate its on purpose thus I have added a genre tag to the game until address, the new Genre being Toxicity Simulator since it's apparently intended that we breed and farm toxicity in matches.

2nd Update: When you are matched against people your level it's fun however matchmaking is absurd, got on a winning streak and now i'm stuck in an MMR with survivors who rush 5 gens in under 5 minutes and i dont even have any of the meta perks available to all my killers (i've only prestiged once on Pinhead and the crow lady) So now I cannot play for the rest of the month until reset.

Update 2024: Cheaters are out in mass, down to only playing three games a day otherwise I get matched against sweatlords or cheaters, confirmed players with no hit collision to killer powers or m1, players preventing perks from activating, and players hiding Unique auras not covered by any survivor perks (killer instinct and Footprints in Xenomorph Tunnel)",1673217239,1706205067,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The endgame chat is just a way to get other people to call you horrible, horrible things more creatively, and does not provide a fair and even balance between killers, maps, survivors, or perks in general. I highly, highly recommend getting this game if you want to kill yourself and just need that little extra push, because the developers and the community of this game will provide it to you almost immediately. Whether you are playing this game as a newby running a pretty bad build due to limited perk options, running the Mr. Nice Guy Build, playing slugging nurse, or even intentionally letting the survivors escape out of the exit gates, you will always face backlash with what you are doing by the most vile, degenerate people on the face of the planet. And do not bother going to other places to complain or vent even remotely dbd related. Even Quora pages will leave you with clinical depression from the sheer backlash of daring to play this game to win. Dead by Daylight needs serious help, and has left me needing it as well.

Interesting for intermediates. 
And a slog for pros.
Definitely takes some time to get good at the game but in the meanwhile, the goofy nature of the game, for e.g., Nic Cage being chased by Chucky is what keeps it fun and refreshing. If you wanted all your favourite horror characters in one game, this is for you. You've got a lot of the classics (Ghostface, Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, etc) and you can't go wrong with anyone. 
Overall an 8/10
The 2 because the experience could've been more polished.
Bugs, exploits and cheaters are there although a rare occurrence personally.
The UI and the shop could've been leap years better if BHVR simply put the time in it.
Why can't we buy entire collections of outfits instead of manually buying each outfit for every individual?
Why is the auto-prestige option available from P1 and not P0?
Why isn't there an FOV slider yet?
So many QOL changes that are missing that would make this game an easy 10/10 eyes closed.

As a killer if you dare to take the job, Just try not to get agitated by how stressfull your job is, Unless you play Hillbilly, He is broken as all crap. Along that in this game people will rage at your profile just because you killed them or because you did your job as a killer, And if you let other survivors die because it is to dangerous for your own life, Expect also a massive rage comment, I find the game decant but the community in this game is pure cancer. It is actually worse then League Or Dota in my opinion. I suppose if anything you are forced to make your profile privvate or friends only to not come acress the salt and rage in this game. With that said, This game takes grinding to get certain Perks what is even more crappy in my personal opinion.

As a last thing said, If you wana play this game for fun with some friends, Expect to get yelled at because apperandly it is toxic, You heared me, it is Toxic to play a multiplayer game with your friends. Do you still get it ? Because I certainly don't. The fact you get yelled at no mather what side you play and no mather what you do is pathetic and it surely makes it that I wound NOT recommend this game purely because off 2 main reasons. 

1. Killer in this game is a joke all you need to do is run around the same pallet or loop for 5 minutes and the game is done be either all generators done or the killers ragequitting.
2. Survivors in this game are mostly cancer. Is just teamagging and bullying the killer along with that just overal toxic behavior and making you think you are playing with little kids.

Maybe if the community gets better this game gets a me a possivity line but for now, If you rahter have a fun play, Stay the hell avay from the toxic waste land.",1528706656,1705926654,False,7,1,0.578264713287353516,6,True,False,False

Very positive rating on Steam is a meme, reviews are given as positive without actual review part + majority of players come from Epic. Literally, you turn off cross-play, suddenly you can't get a single match in 10 mins of waiting ! 
[b]As killer, you go against:[/b] TLDR: trolls
- 4 jerks who make you chase them in forever circles
- people who just give up for some reason in the middle of a match
- trolls who on purpose provoke you, they're trying to ruin your mood
- extra trolls, who even when they open the escape door, stand there until you reach them, just so that they can pathetically t-bag in front of you and then walk away - if you refuse to entertain them, they'll literally wait minutes until the very end, prolonging the lost match, just to get their pitiful satisfaction
- stupidly high level players, like Level 100 ! - my second match was against 2 of them
[b]As survivor, you go against: [/b] TLDR: surprise, also trolls
- killer who picks you as their target and then just focuses on killing you and only you
- killer who puts you up on a hook and then stands next to you until you're dead
- killer that gives up in middle of match on playing at all
- killer that downs you as you're the last person alive and sits next to you until the match ends minutes later

Either way, you'll play against and with pathetic remnants of human beings, trolls and provokers, people that aren't playing a game, they're trying to piss you off. Saddest part is, that the game could be fun without these individuals. But since majority of the ""community"" is toxic, you very very rarely get a fair and fun match. 

There are also stupid perks that break the game on both sides, nonsense of infinite jumping out of windows and generally no reason to report anyone, even cheaters, because nobody gets ever banned. Balance in this game ? Non existent, you'll play against people with thousands of hours in the game, right from the start. Considering that they literally have perks you can't even get at that point and know all the maps perfectly, good luck. They also don't play for fun, majority of them play just to annoy everyone online that they run into, and ofc at the end of the match, they'll try to provoke you in chat.

Occasionally the game can be fun, but it won't be against the troll teams. And that's majority of them, especially from Epic, where the game is free and where majority of the playerbase for this game comes from. Sadly, it's the only assymetrical game that's still alive, even in at the start of 2024, mainly thanks to licensing everyone's beloved horror stars.

Core gameplay is literally very basic and can devolve into the most boring game: survivor, find generator, hold a button to ""repair it"", press space bar when QTE shows up, fixed, that's it, move to the next one. Killer meanwhile: goes around all generators, listening if one's running or not. With perks he can also randomly hear explosion sound coming from people running near birds, killer goes there, hits a survivor, survivor runs, killer runs after them like in a cartoon. Once survivor messes up, killer finally catches up with him, downs the survivor, puts them on a hook and then politely goes away from that area and hunts for another one, fully knowing that this survivor's gonna get rescued soon, making his effort pointless.

Lost potential: game would be much more fun without all the nonsense perks, for both killers and survivors. With more variety to survivor objectives, rather than just getting to generator and pressing a space bar on a QTE. Actual incentives for people to not be so horrible to each other and punishments for the toxic players. Better level design, that doesn't allow for infinite running in circles and jumping through windows and infinite pallet drop runs. It looks fun on videos, but when you play yourself, it's frustrating, especially against high level players with very strong perks, it becomes tedious.

Last mention is the DLC, unlocking new survivors / killers is extremely slow and tedious, it's designed to push everyone to buy the characters with real cash. $300 worth of DLC says it all. 

P.S.: If you'll really decide to buy the game, get it on sale. Look up which characters are fun to play before mass buying DLCs and in Options, there's Anonymous mode that you can turn on, it hides your name from other players. Find guides for your favorite characters, try out different perks and best of luck with having some fun.

With over 2,000 hours invested and exclusive streaming, it's clear that the game offers a unique and enduring experience.

The asymmetrical gameplay, where one killer hunts down four survivors, provides endless variety and tension. The ever-expanding roster of killers and survivors, each with their own abilities and perks, keeps the gameplay fresh and dynamic.

However, the game's community dynamics can be a double-edged sword. While the variety of player interactions adds to the unpredictability, the presence of toxic players can be frustrating. The balance between intense competition and a positive gaming environment is a challenge, especially for someone who streams the game regularly.

Despite occasional frustrations, the constant updates, new content, and the developers' commitment to evolving the game contribute to its longevity. The fact that you've invested so much time and exclusively stream ""Dead by Daylight"" speaks volumes about its appeal.

In essence, ""Dead by Daylight"" offers an exhilarating experience, but the presence of toxicity and occasional frustrations is a testament to the passionate and competitive community.

It's very addictive and re-playable so if you don't have the time to spend on a new game this one is not for you. There are also frustrating moments in the game such as toxic killers, survivors, and strategies. However all that being said I've never played a more refined and re-playable 4v1 Asymmetrical game before. This game just has a spark games that Ash v. Evil dead and Evolve never got right. 

This game is easy to get into, has very high moments of excitement as well as goofy moments. As with all horror games, the horror element of the game starts to fade, but even near 1200 hours in I still find myself getting jump scared and feel at the edge of my seat sometimes. I also believe the devs have done an overall good job balancing and refining this game they're clearly passionate about. With all the licensed characters that have been added over the years and amazing original characters. I see this game lasting a long time.   Some of my favorites are Alien and Silent Hill

It taps into your inner emotions and I often end up shouting 'I hate this game', but really it's a love-hate thing.

As a survivor, it has thought me that I actually am more of a coward than I would like to believe... I will do whatever I have to do to escape alive. Even it means selling out my fellow survivors, beg for mercy or act silly (noseboops teehee) or just run away without looking back. After 400 hours of playing, I still get scared, which is really impressive!

As a killer - I am mostly completely ruthless, but I have to admit that I'm starting to grow a soft heart. Even with all the 'limitations', players have found very creative ways to communicate - from noseboops, offering their items, or slowly shaking yes/no with their heads... it makes for hilarious moments in between all the tension!

DBD can be a funny and entertaining 1vs4 online game where you can play as a killer or a survivor like in your favourite horror movies. The thrill is easy to feel in both roles, killers must get the survivors and these need to escape through two different doors restoring the power fixing 5 generators. In some situations you can escape through a hatch.
The concepts are easy to get, there are a lot of content to combine: perks, hexes, items, addons. Some killers are harder to play than others.

[h2] The bad side: [/h2]
There are a lot of DLCs, normally high priced and they release more and more to keep the hype and players attention. The base game comes with ten killers and survivors. I suggest to get them on sales or use ""shards"" (""game money"" you win when you level up) instead of money if you can (not all characters can be bought by shards though).

The company could do things much better. They don't even know their own game, because they don't play it. 
So they are completely oblivious to what's going on. Looks like they give priority to opinions coming from people having a tantrum instead of listening opinions from people providing them a useful feedback. Is for this that the game has a lot of hasty wacky stupid changes in short periods of time. What you find entertaining can disappear in any moment, or a simple game mechanic can be removed and spoil the whole game for a (normally long) period of time.

All online games have rotten apples. Some people will write insults on your profile, teammates will disconnect of the game, some like to insult in chat...etc.
But no worries because not everybody are like these ones. There are cool and nice people that makes a funny and positive experience of the game =)

[h2] Conclusion: [/h2]
I used to enjoy and have a lot of fun with this game but now it's just not the same, at this point is getting very chaotic and I wouldn't recommend it to new players or older DBD gamers.
The game can be very amusing and challenging and yet very unfair if you're playing in the wrong update date.

I see DBD and other ""Behaviour"" games and it seems they're good having original and good ideas but they fail when it's time to make them work.  I've been a witness of how this company along with their lack of communication, rudeness towards their players/clients, arrogance and incompetence have destroyed their own game and reputation.

Edit: If you are willing to ""grind the game out,"" wait for long killer queues, or play with friends, you will have fun. If you are NOT willing to do those things, find something else. (Also a lot of ""meta"" perks and stuff are locked behind pay walls, and only 1 perk per DLC is typically relevant.) The game starts to get good at around hour 20. So we got some MMO syndrome over here where the only ""good content"" is late game, making the experience for new players really bad.

Original Review

Queue times for killer are too long. Survivor gameplay is a mixed bag of feelings. Character ""power level"" and ""usefulness"" out of the box is all over the place. The game's recent colorblind mode made the game finally playable in a lot of ways, where in the past I couldn't even SEE on most maps due to black on black color scheme that couldn't be changed, but the lack of sound options or video options, as a whole, still make things way too difficult to see or hear.

1: Toxicity, the playerbase has a loud minority of people who will insult you if you lose, and accuse you of cheats/exploits/degenerate strategies if you win. These people can be largely ignored by not reading chat, but every now and again you will face an opponent playing in bad faith looking to ruin the game for everyone for the sake of it.

2: Problems intrinsic to a 4v1: on survivor sometimes the killer is going to go for you and ignore everyone else (referred to as ""tunneling""). There are ways to counter it with clever teamworks and perk usage, but you will have to accept that it is going to happen to you once in a while.

3: DLC microtransactions: you will probably want to spend some extra money down the line if you get invested. You can play the game perfectly fine without though. This problem is more prominent playing killer, as the killer characters are unique vs. survivors who all have the same functionality.

If you can accept these conditions, Dead by Daylight is one of the most fun and engaging pvp party games on the market. The skill ceiling is high with lots to learn (and a community that creates a load of recources to do so). Very fun to play with friends, but even solo qeue is not nearly as bad as people would have you believe.

Maps are very unbalanced, and the game suffers from ""perkapalooza.""  Many perks are useless on both the killer and survivor sides, and a few perks are so powerful that they are very frequently used over and over again in every match.

The one thing DBD has going for it over VHS is that DBD doesn't try to over-balance MMR-based matchmaking.  In my opinion, over-balancing the MMR-based matchmaking with a small player pool was ultimately the downfall of VHS.  Every VHS match was very sweaty.  By contrast, DBD has a reasonable mix of sweaty matches, easy matches, and matches where you get destroyed. It is true that maps, characters, and perks should be balanced at high-level play in a game, but as former Halo developer Max Hoberman points out the matchmaking system should actually incorporate some imbalance to prevent matches from always being sweaty.  Despite failing quite spectacularly at balancing the game at high-level play, DBD does well at incorporating MMR-based imbalances into the matchmaking process itself so that you aren't constantly in matches where the opponent(s) are always at your skill level.

Other than that I think VHS was superior to DBD in virtually every way.  The directional sound cues in DBD are garbage when compared to VHS.  DBD's sound cues are not very directionally accurate.  I do wish Behaviour would consider improving this because high-quality, trackable sound cues made for *much* deeper skill development for killer mains in VHS.  It would add a badly needed dimension to DBD gameplay if they improved it.

Beyond sound cues, VHS had extremely well thought-out killers/survivors and maps that worked well in almost any combination.  This is not the case at all for DBD.  While DBD's matchmaking incorporates a good distribution of MMR imbalances so that matches aren't always sweaty in a pure skill sense, DBD itself is a very poorly balanced game.  This frequently leads to matches where skill is not always the factor that determines a win, and instead luck is an uncomfortably large component.  E.g. was the map killer or survivor biased, was a weak/overpowered killer chosen, were weak/overpowered perks/add-ons chosen, etc.  In VHS skill alone almost always determined which side won, not these other factors.  If DBD balanced the game at high-level play across all characters, maps, perks, and add-ons while keeping imbalanced MMR matchmaking, it would be an amazing 4v1 game, but I don't think that's very likely to ever happen.

Overall though I have to give a thumbs up to DBD for standing the test of time, but it's very clear that it's seat as the king of 4v1 games is far from a foregone conclusion.  If a game like VHS were to come around again with a better advertising campaign, a more lax MMR-based matchmaking system, and good map/character/perk balance, I think it could very easily capture significant market share from DBD.

Until that day, DBD scratches the itch if you enjoy 4v1 games.  Just don't take it too seriously.  DBD is a light-hearted party game that provides good entertainment value when you take it for what it is.  The comp aspect of it is completely laughable compared to VHS, but as long as you know that going in, you can still have a lot of fun playing it.",1644471857,1705556640,True,0,0,0.501672685146331787,0,True,False,False

This game is a decent amount of fun, but the monetization is like what you'd expect from a mobile game despite already having a $20 entry fee. If you want access to all of the characters you'll have to be coughing up at least $100 for one side alone. You might think ""oh, I don't NEED every character"", but
- Almost every character drops with at least one game-changing Perk, which will be extremely difficult to get without buying them (not impossible, but)
- The meta changes wildly with every major update, and Perks that might seem useless at first also have the potential to be buffed into top tier
- The challenges that come with every battle pass drop encourages you to play with paid characters and their Perks
And so you'll inevitably spend the money or miss out on a very large part of the game. Despite how expensive it is to get into the game and get the full experience, they have the gall to also charge $5 for a single cosmetic item, which can range from a new weapon for your Killer to a change in haircut.

Despite some balancing issues on either side, the gameplay is surprisingly fun and unique (mostly because every other asymmetrical multiplayer game ends up dying out) and I'd love to recommend it, but I ultimately can't purely because of how much it costs to actually get into it.


UPDATE: The devs more or less said in a recent Q/A that they do not plan to add new general perks for free, and they seem to have no plans for making the game accessible to new players at all aside from lowering the price of certain DLC - except it's all bundled together as well, meaning you have to spend some hefty cash anyway. It still costs $200 to get access to 75% of the perks for both sides total, and that's not even going into how different killers play or how the audio and cosmetics of survivors might make you more likely to play them as well. Even if you want to just play one side, you're still spending upwards of $100 in the in-game store.
Factor in that the battlepass is now deliberately designed to focus on new characters, and you're SOL if you want to spend a minimal amount of money on the game. Don't buy this game if you value your wallet.",1596909655,1705552753,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Don't Play[/h1]

[b]Immense Frustration[/b]

The gameplay loop revolves entirely around robbing your enemy of fun. This makes the experience miserable and the community is notoriously horrible as a result. Both sides are heavily encouraged to keep the other from playing the game.

Survivors' job is the extend chase for as long as possible while their teammates repair generators. This is accomplished by running around, dropping pallets and creating distance between them and the killer. Survivors can stun the Killer, blind them, run away, etc.

Killers' job is to put as many survivors onto meat hooks as possible and sacrifice them. They can also leave survivors on the floor to very slowly bleed out.

Both sides, when played efficiently, will cause the other side to no longer interact with the game. Survivors will often be [i]just[/i] outside of reach. Killers can literally put Survivors in time-out on hooks or on the floor.

The better one side is at this, the more painful the experience is for the other. Most games work like this as it's obviously not fun to lose. But because Dead by Daylight revolves around non-interactivity, losing feels indescribably miserable. If Survivors are decently better than the Killer, the Killer will spend a majority of the game running around and accomplishing nothing, rarely/never able to get hits as they are taunted and made fun of. If the Killer is decently better than the Survivors, the Survivors will accomplish nothing and be repeatedly forced to sit on the floor or a meathook doing absolutely nothing, sometimes facecamped, etc. There is almost never a balanced match, so one of these two options will inevitably take place. You are either the side having fun, or you're not. Most likely, you're not. Losing feels overwhelmingly hopeless.

The icing on the cake is that sometimes each side can lose despite doing nothing wrong. Survivors can lose because the Killer brought overpowered addons (upgrades), Killer is playing a high-tier Killer, their teammates are bad, etc. Killers can lose because the Survivors brought overpowered items/addons, the Survivors are coordinated and can safely camp every pallet, the Killer they're playing is low-tier, etc. Both can lose due to bad map generation or just plain ol' bad luck.

The developers are also infamously out of touch with the community. Simple changes can take literal YEARS to release, and decisions will consistently be made that are direct opposites of community consensus. It's almost impressive how horrible their decisions can be sometimes. Content releases are also quantity over quality, often leaving players disappointed and every release a total buggy mess.

The game is also balanced around good behavior. Killers are expected to not do certain things such as ""tunnel"" (kill one Survivor as fast as possible, ignoring others). There are also other, personal unspoken rules that each Survivor expects Killers to follow and may vary. For some reason, Survivors do not have a similar expectation. The ""rulebook"" means that most games, many of the Survivors have unrealistic expectations for matches, as the average Killer may not be aware of the rules or choose not to follow them. This frustrates a lot of players, adding to the endless cycle of being pissed off and taking it on other people (the only reason to follow [i]any[/i] of the 'rules' is to be nice - most of them are self-imposed handicaps, so obviously most players ignore them).

Everything about the game is just completely and utterly miserable. But...

[b]Sometimes It's Fun[/b]

When the game is fun, it's [b]really[/b] fun. The lows in the game may be really low, but the highs are equally as high.

It's very addicting. Frankly, the fun matches are nowhere near as common as the miserable ones. But the fun games were so fun that it doesn't matter. You will want to keep playing anyways to chase that high.

Please just don't bother. If you get into it I promise you will regret it.

It is excruciatingly frustrating and every player is chasing a high. Everyone is an asshole that is taking out their frustrations on others. Nearly every match is misery.

I beg you not to play. Playing this game frequently is suicide to your mental health. Everyone is always feeling terrible and frustrated and trying to drag down others. Terrible feeling to surround yourself with. Avoid it.",1598434907,1705541302,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

At the time of this review I have over 2500 hours playing as solo survivor. Around 1000 hours playing as killer.

This game could be fun, but there are too many people who get into this game that have no respect for the spirit of asymmetric games or party games. I would love to be able to just blame players, but this is the sole fault of the developers. 

They have the data, they have the stats but they refuse to get it. This game will never be balanced, its too late. In an effort to get more franchises they have destroyed the main game play mechanics. 2017-2019 was the golden age of the this game.  Why? Because at that point in time what made the game fun for the majority of players existed, not in a vacuum but on display as its main component. Now its gone. They've run out of ideas and instead of making new game modes to incorporate the new franchises they want to add they've just made it a lopsided unfun boring press W or hold m1 for almost every match now. This goes for both sides.

There are several things that became the downfall of this game. 2 I will mention. I think the most important one was adding survive with friends. Survive with friends made an already mildly toxic game experience exponentially worse. 4 man survivor is beyond easy, its actually pathetic its allowed. This game experience is shared by every killer, you get into a match and you get stomped and you get an assortment of bad mannered players harassing you at the end. The next match you go in and decimate all the survivors who don't say a word, but you pop off. Now you've become the toxic one. 

The next one, was after its lead developer lost a match being live streamed he lost the plot. He fell into a black abyss and kept ramping up killer powers. Which was fine, but in the process a lot of the game development was obviously based on a retributive streak instead of a balanced perspective. (If you ever wonder why nurse hasn't changed and is still as over powered this is it)

This can't be a competitive experience, but alas 7 years in the developers still can't make it clear. 

Playing survivor used to be fun, because it was teetering on the edge of being too difficult.
Killer used to be fun, because it was teetering on the edge of being too difficult.

Now, survivor is unfun, boring, repetitive and lackluster experience where the match you play is impossible or beyond easy.

Now, Killer is unfun, boring, repetitive and lackluster experience where the match you play is impossible or beyond easy.

I can't for my life fathom a new player installing this game and not just uninstalling it after a few hours. The amount of dedication it takes to understand the ins and out at this point is a toll. With hundreds of perks (mostly useless) and dozens of killers and survivors its a daunting task just to learn what the hell is going on. 

I will continue to play because I hope for its future, but I can't recommend anyone else at this point.

Ok seriously. If anyone see my review, here's why this game STILL has problems. Today I will be sharing the incredibly unethical and fun that I used to play the game as a survivor.
Here's the thing. Matchmaking now seem to work depending on how much you survive. (Used to be the pip.) So what if you just intentionally die (previously de-pip)? All you need to do is to keep a mindset of your happiness from a match as a survivor is not depending on survival or not.
Here's how I played. I used ""Plunderer's Instinct"", ""Balanced Landing"" and ""Quick and Quiet"". I never use ""Sprint Burst"". I chose off-meta (and probably still off-meta) perks only. I racked up hundreds of items from the chests, and able to survive chase from killers from unexpected sprint after falling, or hiding in a locker.
The most important part of this strat is to control your MMR or pip. For instance, previously, since I do not want to pip, I will intentionally give up on some score earning categories. This may include objective and altruism. Yes, you read it right. I can intentionally let every other survivor die so I can use the hatch. Since now the MMR is based on survival, you can simply max out all objectives and die at the end, there's only 5000 BP difference. You can get matched with less skilled killer over and over, repeat.

Original Review: 
No team score system, which discourages pub survivors from cooperation.
People can disconnect to prevent rank loss. (Force quit the game)
People can disconnect to prevent others gaining points. (Killer get ~2000 for each DC, far less than killing them in the normal way). DC'd killer will let survivor gain no points.
Saves can be modified and will not be detected as cheat.",1473615291,1705429215,False,5,2,0.54956519603729248,3,True,False,False

The game can be fun if you stick with it and get decent but then you have the devs who nerf or buff things at random just because they enjoy tinkering, is this better than the beginning of the game's inception where it took years to change gamebreaking mechanics? Not sure, but if you stick with this game you will definitely be developing some kind of stockholm syndrome and refuse to leave your abuser. The temporary ban system is really weird. There are ways to get permabanned (cheating, griefing constantly, probably some other shit) but, the way to get a short ban is to disconnect from the game. You can usually do this by pressing the menu button and choosing to ""leave the match"" which will create a short ban. It starts with 1 min, the next  is 5 min, then jumps up to 15 min. I had never reached this point til recently as I have been having blackouts from the recent freezing ass weather that is currently happening where I live. Just got the 30 min ban time within 3 days and I'm not even sure I'm going to try to log back in today. 
I'm not going to stop playing this game because I am very addicted to it, but when something out of your control happens and they basically go: Fuck you, you can wait now. Make it a 5 min ban tops or at least reset the disconnect ban every 24 hours, because this shit is ridiculous.

if you've seen gameplay online and thought it looked boring well you're right! watching gameplay is boring unless you like *insert popular person here*

the real enjoyment comes from actually playing this game, the unexpected, the sense of being alone and all of a sudden you hear your heartbeat raise and know that you're being hunted, that's the game at its core for anyone new jumping in.

the killer might be something you enjoy, knowing inside that you're making people freak out and panic if you enjoy that sort of thing.

on the complete other side of the spectrum you have the OP guys that have been playing for years, they circle objects like a game of cat and mouse and hope that their team is doing a generator in that time, which honestly we probably aren't since we are still trying to find the generator, you might meet one of these people every few games and will probably get carried in these games. (if you are one of these OP people thank you for carrying my ass more than once since I know I suck)

overall this is a pretty fun game but burnout can happen fast, like really fast, but I only play as the survivor since I like the thrill of the unknown.

the DLCs are pretty fun, I haven't personally brought them but I've gifted the entire thing to people over the years since they get pretty hardcore addicted to this game, the range of killers you see and their abilities are wild, if you haven't watched gameplay and just dive into it without knowing you'll have a really good experience playing against them, I enjoyed the ring woman (can't remember her name right now).

while I'm more of a single-player Factorio/Zachtronics sort of person this is one of the few games I enjoy to change things up, you do have a chatbox in the lobby but I'm not sure if there is VoIP since if there was I probably automatically disabled it out of habit. cheating in this game isn't common, I haven't played long enough to see a speedhacker or something but I'm sure they probably do exist but compared to stuff like Tarkov it is non-existent. 

if what I described is something you might enjoy then I'd say give it a go, otherwise, save your money, maybe it's a game you'll enjoy in the future when you're craving something different.",1705402432,1705402432,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like, the game is pretty fun, But I would NOT say this game is ""putting a full-time job's worth of hours in a week into a video game"" type of fun.
I see some of the playtime hours that some people have for this game and it baffles me that people could spend that much time playing the same type of game over and over again.
I guess to each their own but, I mean I guess it's no different than any other multiplayer experience to some degree. But all you're doing is either going around and fixing generators to leave or killing the survivors, and that's the game...
Whereas other multiplayer games that I tend to enjoy have a lot more variety. Like capture the flag, kill enough of the enemy forces, King of the Hill, deliver the payload, etc etc.
Nope, for Dead by Daylight, at least from what I've played through so far, it's just the same thing every time. And yet people rack up over thousands of hours playing it, like HOW.
I guess some of the licensed characters of different horror icons being playable is also a defining factor on why it's so popular, but by the end of the day their licensed characters. It would surprise me that there's a time limit on all of them being available and as soon as their time on the game expires it'll leave DBD as a empty husk now that it has introduced all these different characters, not to mention the microchansactions for every character. My god.
Without getting too much into detail, I have seen second-handed that this game can mess with people's schedules to the point where it feels like they're playing it as an addiction.
Maybe I'm missing something, I don't know. Like I said, the game is fun in its own right, but probably more so in short bursts. 
I do not see this as a game that is worth spending more than one or two hours a day playing, Let alone spending over 40 to 50 hours a week giving some people's play time spanning into the quadruple digits so quickly from what I have observed.

jokes aside this game is weird bc its in a space where it really has no competition. it has so many cool licenses represented and always getting more. really no other mainstream game plays like it.  its....Fun. but then also makes you hate yourself. 
the skill gaps are all over the place and there's so much more to getting good at either role than meets the eye. that said the highs are high and getting to play as chucky or sadako is amazing as a horror fan. and for the original killers theres a good diversity of horror genres represented. the survivors are essentially just reskins of each other but most of them do have lore if you're into that.

It's so cool seeing so many familiar faces and of course new ones, together in a game. The game itself is a huge loveletter to the horror community, wether you like a specific monster or a survivor from a franchise the game will probably have you covert. I like playing as a survivor and most of my playing hours are spent playing as such, but sometimes a few rounds as killer are refreshing as well. The game can be hard to master because of all the differnt killers and perks, but if you have patience this won't be a problem for you. Also the game can feel like playing a ""lottery"" at times, sometimes you will have the time of your life and at other times you will be feeling very frustrated. But you won't have to worry about the frustration if you remember that this is just a game and try to have a positive attitude. Wich brings me to the community of this game, probably one of the worst parts of this game. There will be times people will go willingly out of their way to make you feel bad and even write some completly horrendous stuff in end game chat. Luckilly there is a option to ""turn off"" the end game chat if you press the chat symbol. Alltogether a solid game if you're up for it's high learning curve and manage to respect other players that are just trying to play the same fun game as you. Patience and a positive mindset are the key. Keep in mind that buying the base game can be boring, due to many fun perks being locked behind DLC paywalls, the original characters can be unlocked by playing the game and gathering a in game currency called iridescent shards, however this curreny will take a lot of playing hours gathering enough to buy a single charcter. The other licensed killers and survivor will only be available by spending real money on the DLC pack or spending auric cells (wich have to bought via real money as well).
Personally I would recommend you to wait until there is a discount on steam, so you can pick up some DLC packs for just a couple of euros/whatever currency you use. Hope to see you in the fog soon!",1643546949,1705361232,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I regularly play it with my friends irl and have met some great friends through this game. 3500 hrs (Including some on console) on this game and still playing there's not much more to say than that. It has so much replay-ability to me. Each game feels different because it can go so many ways, so it never gets repetitive to me like some other people say it does. 

My wishes for this game: 
*I would appreciated a few other game mode options where the ratios of asymmetry or the goal is different. 
*As of today (1/15/23)- I would like to see killers ability to hard tunnel from hook or proxy camp completely removed from the game, even if that means you are unable to wear the same cosmetic combo as another survivor - that would increase my enjoyment of this game 10 fold. 
*I would also like to add that I would appreciate alternative objectives (maybe specialized to each unique map). 
*Only licensed killers from here on out would be my preference, I feel that we have plenty of killers and survivors at this point and plenty of perks, the only thing that would add excitement to this game for me in this regard is to get some licenses that I value (IT, Jeepers Creepers, Predator) 
*I also feel that at this many hours in the game there's not much horror aspect to it for me anymore except when I get the jump scares from a scratch-mirror-Myers, Ghost-face, or Hag TP. I feel that a good portion of it being horrifying is how immersed in anticipation of getting hunted down or snuck up on I can feel. Any effort to make this game spookier would be delightful to me.
*Lastly, I would additional Stranger Things DLC -this time with Billy and Eleven or Robin as survivors (or at least skins) and Vecna as the new killer. I would love Vecna's house with an alternate upside down reality you can get to via portal like the Halloween event as a map.",1693325978,1705335318,True,2,0,0.516365408897399902,0,True,False,False

But with that, it brings glaring issues which can also understandably ruin the experience for most people. Below this, I shall list a few things that may determine if you will / will not enjoy the game!


HORROR FRANCHISE FAN: If you yourself are someone that is or has been a fan of horror franchises, either in gaming or in film, there is a good chance you will very much enjoy this game. Being able to immerse yourself as your favorite antagonist when playing killer is such an incredible experience, and the same goes for playing your favorite protagonists. Actively playing a game where you're able to pick and play your favorite character from a media that either never existed as a game, or never existed in a multiplayer format such as this, is and will always be an amazing experience. 

COMPETITIVE: This game is inherently incredibly competitive. Having to work together as a group of four players to combat a single player that is capable of killing you with complete ease, means that this whole game revolves around competition. The same goes for killer too, of course. Playing as a single person that has to deal with four people actively working to cause your downfall, and having to manage so many different objectives at once to prevent them from winning, is stressful as shit. If you are able to put up with stress and competition without getting overwhelmed, then you'll be able to enjoy this game!

TOXICITY BANDWIDTH / SENSITIVITY: The community for this game is lopsidedly toxic. 40% of the time you will either encounter players seeking to have fun with everyone involved, or are simply quiet and focusing on playing the game without any worries. That other 60% however is filled with a bundle of players that either take everything personally despite this simply being a game, or seek to go out of their way to harass, belittle, and be horrible to whoever is opposing them. Killers and Survivors both have a tendency of taking this game far too personally, or forgetting that there are real people behind the characters they're facing. Survivors taking glee in creating as miserable of an experience as possible for the killers by forming groups of harassing players that seek to only make the killer feel like shit instead of playing the game as intended, or feeling as if the killer trying to play the game and win, is a horrible person for doing so, and deserves to be ridiculed for such things. On the opposite side of it, Killers have a tendency of viewing survivors attempting to survive, avoid and play their part of the game, as personally provoking or annoying, causing them to stop playing the game as intended, and instead playing as if they have to prove a point of dealing with someone that has wronged them. This creates a community wide toxic mindset of 'us vs them' when it comes to Killers vs Survivors. If you are capable of not taking this game personally or overly seriously, and playing as it was intended to be played, remembering that the goals on both sides are either to Kill everyone or to Escape unharmed, then you will enjoy the game! Kill them with kindness in return, maybe make people act better!

UNBALANCED GAME-PLAY: This game is incredibly unbalanced. Killers are able to bring one sided loadouts that are nie-impossible to beat and can slaughter everyone within a few short minutes, and players are able to stack up as a full organized team to simply, as previously mentioned, harass and torment the killer, with loadouts dedicated not to playing the game as intended, but to make the Killers life a living hell for as long as the survivors want to fuck with them. It is up to the players to create fun load-outs to use, and its up to them to not be menaces. If you are able to remember that this game will forever be unbalanced and that it never will be fair, and still can have fun with that, you will have fun!

COMMITMENT TO GRIND: This games leveling, prestige, bloodweb and perk system, is immense and tedious in nature. To fully experience the game you must prestige multiple characters, survivors and killers alike, to unlock their abilities and share among eachother. This will take a lot of time and dedication, which some people simply do not have. If you are able to be fine with spending a lot of time playing to finally begin snowballing progression, then you will have fun! This is not a game that you can play for a little bit and get the full experience out of. It requires a lot of dedication!




TLDR: Unbalanced game with a horribly toxic community that is grind heavy and incredibly competitive, but is perfect for people that do not take things personally, can ignore people that take games too seriously, and just want to play to have fun. Heavy bonus points if you are a fan of horror franchises! This game is a 7/10.",1705307594,1705307594,True,2,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

If I won, it felt like there was something I could have done differently. Same if I lost. This game is heartily recommended to me. 

That said, I do have to warn you about the community, which is the saltiest group of people ever seen outside of an 18th century sailing vessel. Now, when you have an asymmetrical game and there are regular complaints about devs favoring both sides of the game, that does probably mean that it's actually pretty well balanced. But man can these folks be annoying. If you want to play, use all the anonymizing things available. I may just be a salty 30-something playing a game for zoomers, but that doesn't mean they're not whiny.

Any ""balances"" they do implement to curb toxic behaviour etc. just promotes new issues (i.e. endgame camping with the disabled hook meters/edging the border), tweak maps in a negative way (i.e. Ormond rework/smaller maps in general), or nerf perks into the ground for often bs reasons (MFT explicitly). 

I'm not saying the devs aren't trying, it just FEELS like they don't listen to the community, and make changes that drastically hinder/support one side in particular during any major balance update.

On a separate note, some way to communicate in solo queue would be deeply appreciated. Maybe lessen the gap between solo players and SWF a bit? All these other team games have pings/ping wheels, so why can't we? The amount of times I've wished to be able to say/ping: ""I'm going for the save/Leave without me/Open the gate(s)/Don't heal me (plot twist/resilience reasons etc.)/trapped or rigged gen/Stealth killer nearby"" etc etc etc, is actually insane.

And to complain just a tad more (I am very skilled in it :3): the amount of insta-down powers/perks/addons for killers seems like a bit too much. This may just be my dumb*ss opinion, but I honestly feel like insta-downs should be earned and not just handed out like candy, and actually be worked for/require skill and timing. Especially concerning Bubba and Billy. They basically can keep up with running survivors and suffer little to no downtime between chainsaw swings. it just feels... wrong...

Yes the game can be fun when you're able to have fun with it, whether it be playing killer or survivor, BUT there are a lot of issues I've had getting back into it two months ago after not playing it for two years that were not present the first time I was playing.
For one, every match that I finish the 'Grade Progress' tab never shows the actual progress, always saying an error along the lines of 'Grade Progress Error, restarting the game should show your current grade' even though once I get back into the lobby my grade is updated anyways, and that's just something that's annoying. The OTHER major problem I have is that I am Physically Unable to play with other people after the first game upon startup, regardless of what I try to do to fix it, with it saying 'Connection to the party has been lost' with me being unable to invite anybody or join anybody. Everything I've tried does not work; Uninstalling and Reinstalling, Repairing the EAC, Verifying Integrity of Files, Verifying Integrity of Files and then manually installing EAC before opening the game. Nothing Works, and I cannot be asked to go thru the motions of the support tickets because as far as I know, this kind of issue is PERSON TO PERSON and DOES NOT HAPPEN FOR EVERYONE, and it should supposedly fix itself in due time, but in the past two months with there being at least 4 separate updates, there's been no change, in fact there's only been more bugs rather than less, but with as many interactions with however many killers, survivors, perks and add-ons I'm not surprised more bugs pop up after every update with how spaghetti the code of this game is, and I wouldn't be surprised if there are other people who have a similar issue with being unable to play with other people in this game.

Regardless of all the crap with the party issues and the game bugs, even after all that the game can get somewhat repetitive if you have no clear intent or goal put upon yourself, and the archive tomb challenges really help with that, but my only problem is that you can only choose one at a time, and if you have a really easy challenge that just takes a while to accumulate, you take however many games that is doing that one challenge instead of being able to have multiple on at once. But I digress, its not that game changing if you can select multiple at a time.
Not to mention that the amount of effort it takes to get every, single, character, whether its a survivor or a killer, it just takes so dang long to get one of them to prestige THREE, and this is after they changed how much bloodweb items cost.
Monthly grade rewards are helpful towards that, but its at best 2 million a month, which is enough for like, at best 2 prestiges on a single character. Maybe I'm just complaining too much, but I haven't even gotten started on the gameplay.

At least with the killer each power they have makes the games diverse enough to feel like they're unique, but almost all of them still revolve around the 'patrol generators, find survivors, if you don't get one of them within a minute, give up and go back to patrolling, find survivors, down someone, hook them, either patrol around the hook or go back to patrolling generators, etc. etc. and this isn't the same with all killers.
With survivors on the other hand...It's a lot more boring, since they all play the same after you unlock all the perks. Yes you can take chases and loop and all that jazz, but for the most part you still just sit on generators, either hide or run if the killer is nearby, if someone gets hooked you either go for them or assume someone else is going to *reminder I'm only able to play Solo Q so my opinions might be different than others, but i can't have other opinions because I'm physically unable to even play with others in a SWF* and then go back to doing generators and then once they're done open the gate and escape.
I'd be able to enjoy this game more if the game wasn't so repetitive on the survivor side and so stressful on the killer side, alongside the crap with the party issues and not being able to play with others. It won't stop me from trying to get all the achievements but I would be able to have more fun and enjoy it more if the issues were not there at all.",1705093306,1705093306,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dear Buyer,

The artificial (not-human) teammates, who are added to your team in this game, are counter-productive. I understand the need to ""fill in"" matches, but...  if players are that few-and-far-between please just increase their queue time. I would be more likely to play survivor if I knew I wouldn't get an AI teammate.

If you're going to play, you better have friends to Survivor With Friends (SWF) because Solo Queue sucks and Killers are punching bags for SWFs.  MMR changes have exacerbated this in the extreme.

This game is buy to play, but is actually a F2P grind model with P2W elements.  Some of the best horror franchises are wasted here and it's a fucking shame they have no real competition.

This game is rife with cheaters and hacks and BHVR just tries to hide shit instead of fix it.  They're also incredibly shit at balance, and the game is heavily tilted in favor of one side over the other.  The community is extremely toxic, generally.  It's entirely designed in UE4 Blueprints (think RPGMaker for FPS) making it one of worst optimized games I've ever played.

If not for these things, the game would be much better than it is.

EDIT: I also forgot, some of the worst matchmaking imaginable - brand new players against hardened vets is the norm.

There are also absolutely no assistive technologies such as for color blindness or hearing issues.  There isn't even a Brightness or Gamma slider in a HORROR GAME.

EDIT2:  The progression system is unmitigated endless grind, you cannot use perks you paid for in DLC without grinding a million hours worth of blood points first.  To actually max an account takes 1.5 BILLION bloodpoints, a perfect game, as a killer which gets the most, is 32k.  People with 8,000 hours don't have everything.

This is actually a bad Korean F2P game in quality, grind, and monetization.  Their devs and forum moderators are some of the thinnest skinned woke PC garbage to ever walk the Earth.

They also have the most anti-consumer ""battle pass"" style system I've ever seen - even if you play at the highest level and play this game as a full time job it's designed for you to spend extra cash on getting tier unlocks because grinding them is impossible.

What I liked :
- years and years worth of content
- good multiplayer support
- freedom to experiment with different builds for fun playstyles
- can play Killer or Survivor
- potential for great fun, solo with strangers, or with your friends


What I did not like :
- the basic gameplay loop is boring, you sit on generators

because when playing as survivor, every match you have up to 3 chances to be shown just that! you see, in this game, the killer has to impale survivors on to a meat hook that can be decorated with pride flags, where survivors can't really do anything but wait for a teammate to rescue them. so there is plenty of time to get familiar with the killers sexual preferences, gender identity and political opinions.

also, don't worry about bigoted killer players killing you off first because of your pride flag cosmetics. you see, the developers have stated that they ban players for harassment if they do that. finally a horror game where you don't have to feel scared!

other players also can NOT opt out of seeing those, so you can make a stand for yourself by showing your own pride flags to all other players, and ""bigots"" can't do anything about that. they have to see all the stuff they dislike in games whether they want to or not!

I bought the game on PC when cross-progression got leaked just for it to be debunked a month later so thats why I have like 1 hour on this game. So there is no point on playing PC for me since everything I own is on console. So this is my current thoughts on the game. I have around 700 hours on Xbox and since the Knight chapter, Behaviour could not give a dam about anything besides sales. I originally got the game when the Resident evil chapter came out because I thought it was awesome that Nemesis and Jill were playable in a different video game. I had so much fun on the game during 2021 and half of 2022 then it all went downward. Behaviour is way too slow at balancing the game for a ""live service"" one and let killers/perks be broken for months, or forever like nurse and blight. The devs just want your money now and it's really sad because they capitalize on these big licenses to basically be a Fortnite of horror. Otzdarva's video on the devs not listening shows how much they only care about the competitive community. The devs cannot find a balance for the casuals and sweats which can be tough for almost any game, but 80% of the feedback is ignored anyways. The devs have really slowed down on the balance and health of this game for all these big chapters and let the game stay buggy and have all of the server issues. It's really sad as these guys used to be loved and praised by the community but now their goal is just to maximize revenue. My biggest issue and the reason why I would never recommend this game to anyone anymore is the toxicity. This game doesn't even have voice chat and is still more toxic than even competitive FPS games like Valorant or CSGO. Tunneling has been in the game since year one and they just accepted it now (for new people reading tunneling is where the killer targets one person out of the game first by ignoring other players). Most DBD players will tell you to just not play if you don't like it then don't play survivor or the game in general which is what I have been doing. Or it isn't the killers job to make the game fun for you. These are both valid but if you really ponder, aren't games SUPPOSED to be fun? Why does DBD allow this exception for a player to instantly just get removed from the game. They can queue for a new one but most people play survivor with friends because of solo queue which I will get into later. Now for the killer side: sweaty survivors just make the game unplayable. There will be times where you get into a game with a 4 stack and this becomes very common if you are good at killer. That 4 stack will just play rude, tea-bag you, gen rush you, and then send you messages after the game saying how bad you were. Now the argument for this is that every game has toxicity. Very true but what people fail to realize is that the MMR system is extremely flawed and the devs have done a horrible job on it. Too commonly you will be unmatched into an unfair game. This issue results in the bad balancing by nerfing survivor constantly and just buffing killers over and over again. But when you buff them over and over then the casuals now have to deal with overdrive billy and no recoil trickster. Especially stealth killers which make it extremely hard for new players. The last thing I want to address is solo queue because if you don't have a 4 stack on survivor, then your random teammates will have no coordination with you. This also results to survivors commonly giving up first hook or sabotaging the team. The game basically requires you to 4 stack if you want a even chance which leads to another issue; the sweat stacks for killers. You starting to see how all these issues connect? Now I want to wrap this off with my final point being this game is NOT new player friendly. To any new players who are still reading this, if you are getting the game get ready for a ton of toxicity, a large unnecessary skill gap that the devs forced to help the competitive community, and to not have fun a lot of times you are playing. This game is built on the foundation of you being ready to endure the toxicity and be willing to learn all of these complicated techs, perks, killers, and maps or you buying it for a licensed horror character you like to play for about a week and just forget the game even exists. You have the choice to play any way you want but the results that will come depending on how you play is my warning. If you get easily angered, are in it to win it, and want to loop the killer forever/destroy the survivors you probably shouldn't play this game unless you want to dedicate yourself to being apart of the community. If you are more passive, want to get scared, play this game for fun, can handle toxicity, and don't mind loosing ALOT then this game is probably better for you but the truth is, not a lot of people are like that and they want to enjoy an even balance between winning and loosing. So primarily I would not recommend getting into this community and being an active player. But the choice is totally yours in the end. I hope this review helped you at least a little but currently the game has a lot of flaws not being fixed and that's why I'm not going to recommend it.",1703701312,1704920530,False,2,0,0.538835883140563965,0,True,False,False

There are bugs & glitches galore with this game, this game is more unpolished than my kitchen floor yet instead of fixing the bugs and the issues, the core fundamental issues with the game, they want to add MORE stuff to the game which ultimately means even more bugs & glitches + their customer service is non-existent.

After 8000 hours in this game (whether mostly survivor or not is irrelevant) I can safely say without a doubt this game is NOT worth full price. They care more for making money than making a good game which is deeply saddening. The game is HORRIFICALLY unbalanced. Was back in 2016, and still is now. While I admit i started playing in 2018 even I felt like the game was quite heavily survivor sided and even more so to this present day. Back then there was some semblance of decency to this game & you could enjoy it. But the player base is by FAR the most toxic I've ever experienced, even more so than Rust! There are even people who will go as far as to call you a..... child liker, to use an expression. A malicious attempt to destroy peoples credibility and lives potentially. I have one person who harasses me with these false accusations myself.

As said the game is HEAVILY unbalanced & in favour of the survivors, but high MMR is nothing but meta on BOTH sides. Skill Based Match Making was the biggest mistake, followed closely by cross play. BHVR keep pushing this as a COMPETITIVE game, when the game is almost WHOLLY a party game. The games are filled with people that just want to be really unpleasant, whether its constant toxicity from survivors to killers, or killers willing to grief you, 4 minute slug you or constantly hit you on hook. I've been maliciously targeted by MANY of these ""Griefers"" as survivor and unpleasant people and its made my gaming experience from September 2021 to Jan 2024 (time I've quit the game out of respect for myself) an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE AND MISERY. Their customer service is also downright disgraceful, when I report griefers, or hackers, nothing gets done. One griefer who I wont name has targeted me across 17 out of 18 games across the span of a couple of months, I have provided MULTIPLE videos of evidence of them griefing me and BHVR has done NOTHING.

Occasionally there can be some nice fun games in this, and when you have wholesome moments in DBD and meme times in this game they are usually some of the best you'll ever have, but are too few and far between for me to justify giving a recommendation here, and the fact there are SO MANY bugs and glitches, and quite a few hackers too which BHVR either wilfully ignores or just plainly cant be bothered to fix it further validates the latter point.

All and all this game has the potential to be 10/10 quality, but the developers legit just throw it all away with their corporate greed before game polish approach, and the lack of caring for the DBD community is inconceivable. Sadly I can only give it a 2/10. I CANNOT forgive the companies poor ethics, lack of care for the game, the disgraceful customer service I've had, and the incompetence in a lot of other areas as well.",1572565220,1704880151,False,1,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

-It is a grindy game if you plan on trying to become more successful in-game; with a steep learning curve. I recommend researching what perks to unlock first; from what killers, so you don't waste as many bloodpoints when you begin. 
-DLC characters aren't a MUST; but it will help immensely, even just 1-2 DLC ( w/ characters/killers) is beneficial and enough to get you semi-started.
-Killer is the way to go for bloodpoints; but it can be frustrating as the matchmaking system isn't perfect and you're often paired against survivors that are MUCH more experienced in the game (but this isn't EVERY game) (And a lobby while playing as Killer CAN take a bit to find)

So i doesn't rly have much time in this game, but i indeed follow all the news and play it every years. but back to then i have R6 as my main game, so i only have few hours in this game.

let's talk about the good side of this game, it is the longest and most played sur vs killer game in my opinion. and it is rly fun to play whatever with sneak style both killer or sur, and having some awesome chases with killer or sur. also it has so many way to play this game thx to the perks compination and addons. it was rly fun.

why do i say it was fun? cus last few month while i have DBD as my main game, i realise so many problem now. sur gen rush and toxic, killer camp, tunnel and toxic.

So it is rly hard to play as a beginner, and those killer/sur problem is still now the huge minus point for me.

personal shout out:
i hope somedays behavior can find the balance, but for me i want the old DBD back.
stopmaking the game faster and smaller, just like the reason i quit R6.
i hope i will still able to have fun in this game next few years.
and how many survival are with speed 4.2 or even 4.4

The main negatives for new players would be the fact this game can be pay to win as various top level perks are only obtained with killers/survivors that you need to purchase with real money. They have measures to help with this slightly with a method of purchasing perks with in game currency you earn but it still takes a long time to get these perks plus they're randomised each week. 

You also have issues with how long it takes to level up and prestige survivors and killers. In order to unlock perks you have to level up your characters with a thing called bloodpoints. You earn these after each game sadly it takes a lot of Bloodpoints to prestige a character and the only way you can use perks from one killer/survivor to another is by maxing that character. Considering how many characters there are in this game means this game is very grindy. 

Even with those two big negatives not to mention plenty of other flaws with the game, the game is massively engaging and super addictive.

Of course it was nice with friends, but I found playing killer to be frustrating (esp as a pig main, what a year), and solo queuing survivor wasn't much better either.

So I stopped playing DbD completely a few months later, until this November, 2023. I have been loving it? I don't know what they did at BHVR while I was gone but they actually made the game fun. All the collabs are crazy too, Resident Evil? I get to play as Wesker? Jill? Sheva even? Silent Hill? Chucky? (Alien is actually what got me back into the game, it's one of my favorite movies.)
I actually got called OP playing as pig today too, was a new experience.
So yeah, give it a try. It's on sale for Christmas right now. Get the Ultimate edition for all the old non collab DLC; the Resident Evil bundle if you like Ada/Rebecca/Jill/Leon/Chris/Wesker/Nemesis/Carlos (also blight has a Birkin skin); get the Silent Hill edition not only for the Silent Hill DLC but some other old DLC too.
The monetization on cosmetics can be a bit much sometimes, but you can earn everything (slowly) with in game currency you get from leveling up. They're also handing out a good chunk of it for the holidays as well, so be on the look out for codes and stuff [/strike]

They revised a lot of the maps to be a lot better balance wise, as well as fixing some of the bugs and pallet placements to make a more fluid experience for both sides. Perks still have metas and some balancing issues, however, I have seen much better reform and consistent nerfs/buffs for things that needed it.

A frail, lonely passer-bye appears and you gut them for a tin of aspirin, $50 and some body pins. Turns out, a 15 year-old jackass saw the whole thing. Your pal wants to disembowel her, but you are against murdering children; however, the problem still presents itself. So what do you do? After some blunt force trauma to the head, and a quick stuffing into your car the way you put something in the fridge that won't fit and then quickly slam the door, you begin to take your newest victim to a place you feel more comfortable thinking. After some time, you and your bud compose an idea. More accurately, your psychopath of a friend does. ""If she goes nuts, nobody will believe her when she says some guy got blown away right in the open!"" Your response? :""yeah, and some totally normal girl will just drop their sanity at our beck-and-call. I think we're fucked unless we... u know-"" ""no"" he responds calmly, cutting you off. ""I know what will make anyone go nuts, trust me."" After some real convincing from your pall, you make a questionable purchase on steam. The girl is locked in a room. food is fit in through a small mail slot. The windowless room gives no comfort to Christi, who plays the horror game Dead By Daylight by BHVR for 949.3 hours. Soon after, you make her write a steam review in order to gauge her sanity. She types.

She is imminently executed by your hand. It was a reaction to the words said. Like protecting a loved one from harm, you shoot.  You sigh, blood and lead mix with squashed brain and you step out of the cell. The new coffin-room in your friend's home lies soulless, but not empty.

Many people may think that it is more enjoyable when played with friends. They may be right, but I was always alone and played with pleasure for hundreds of hours. 
Of course, playing as a single survivor has its difficulties. Sometimes, no matter how successfully you play, you can lose because of toxic players and being alone. And that really ruins your mood. But sometimes a complete stranger from somewhere in the world, thinks the same way you do and helps you survive. When this happens, the pleasure I get is priceless. 

This game has given me hundreds of hours of fun. It still continues to give. I met new people, had a lot of fun, sometimes laughed a lot, sometimes got angry, but it was definitely worth the money I paid. I strongly recommend it to everyone.

Update: 1/6/2024 
Don't buy. Wait until it's free. It is a dying game and the company is greedy.
No real updates. Just banning innocent players and accusing them of cheating instead of getting rid of the actual cheaters. I just got blocked in between a generator and bail of hay for the entire match. Encountering tons of killers using speed hacks and exploits. 

Original Post:
DO NOT waste your time and money. They randomly permanently ban players, claiming they cheated when they did not. I have over 1,336 hours and $200+ wasted on this game. These greedy companies should be required to prove you were cheating before banning accounts. They don't give suspensions or warning. They go straight to permanently banning the account. They make more money that way. They make money from banning players. The player has to re-buy the game and any in-game content they want after the ban.

Also, their facial expressions do not match up with their situation When they're injured and crying their face looks like they're watching paint dry.

After the game, 90% of players write all kinds of toxic stuff.

Playing as a killer:
Hung everyone on a hook - tunneler, clown or noob. (and this despite the fact that I’m not tunneling)
Lost to 4 freaks - noob, loser, bot. Well, of course they throw mud at your family.
It feels like they are playing in some kind of tournament, and they beat the player who is the top 1 killer.

Playing as a survivor:
Outplayed the killer - noob, rat.
Lost - noob.

In your team, 99% of the time there will be people who don’t do anything about the game at all. You have to take everything into your own hands and carry everything on yourself. Remove from hooks, repair the generator, clear totems, open gates, distract the killer to yourself, allowing teammates to repair generators. Am I God to you? And the teammates walked all over the map to no avail. Not a single generator was subdued, just a minus game. Until the second stage, no one gives a damn about you, and of course after the game they write in the chat that you are a damn noob.

The reporting system in this game is made just for beauty.
I don’t know if this game gets banned at all...
I'd rather ban toxic bastards. Lifetime ban in chat. Maybe then this game became much more adequate and normal.
If you don't pay attention to the chat at the end of the game, then in principle the game is not bad, no matter what anyone says.
And I have one suggestion for the developers of this game:
CLEAR THE FUCKING CHAT AFTER THE GAME. THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

Honestly, I really did want to have a fun time with the game but I just can't. I won't say the game is bad because of the community being as toxic as it is but I certainly won't say it's not a problem. But it is a problem a lot other games have to deal with so I can't take away points for that.
Note that I did have this game gifted to me so technically it was free.

Now for my actual opinion! The game feels underwhelming and mostly boring at times. Yes, I did have some moments where I was invested but sadly those moments are rare and are short lived.
Now do keep in mind if you plan to get good at the game you have to understand how certain perks work, how killers work, layout of maps, etc. And of course all of that takes what? Time. Now the question is how can I invest my time into the game if I'm bored out of my mind? If I feel like that then how am I supposed to feel encouraged to devout my time into improving? 
Even still, I'll take the blame and say it's my fault because the game isn't for people like me but I can understand why people enjoy this game so do take this review with a grain of salt.

If there is anything that bothers me, its the concept that Killers rely on hitting their prey with x weapon but if they MISS their target, their really isn't much of a delay to allow the victim to get away. Just finish animation and continue chase with a boost in speed. 

They get a speed boost for just about everything and if they got the set of META perks then good luck as survivor cus your chances of living are below 15%. 

Maybe its the map design or something else but in my last game, I managed to avoid a hit from the killer only to have him finish his animation and quickly catch up to me and hit me once and for all....Like that was my opening to escape but instead it just delayed the inevitable. Nice.

BUT the same could be said for the survivor in terms of having the META perks. 

Idk, I feel like this game requires players to cheese all the mechanics to some degree in order to escape and that honestly just sucks.

Something isn't right and I feel like their should be more ways to actually get away from a chase. The longer it goes on the faster the killers becomes and it's like the only way to get away is to literally zig-zag the killer into becoming an idiot and losing track which really isn't easy to do considering their barely any fog or ""Darkness"" or anything else besides a wooden plank to fall over in front of the killer. 

Shame, the concept looked good on paper but the execution was far from perfect. If the game made players rely on their keen senses rather than simply forcing players to get the META set of Perks then the game would have more 'Skill' involved with it. 

Either way, I am glad the game is dead and irrelevant. Too much META this and that with perks, it takes away from the overall experience.",1564431109,1704623495,False,3,0,0.518567800521850586,0,True,False,False

So let's start with the good
- Alot of the mechanics are fun for some of the killers and survivor can be alot of fun as well
- Creative Cosmetics and *some* original characters
- A game that receives constant updates ( Which will also go to the bad )

Now to the bad, Whereas I do believe this game isn't a dead or grave game with no hope or reason to play, These reasons make it hard for me personally to enjoy it anymore.
- I normally wouldn't count this to the game itself but the community is toxic, beyond the point of many others and I put it on par with known toxic ones like COD. Why I am putting this here is because 1. It effects the social media end of this game which can get tiring 2. Because certain game mechanics since I started playing have always encouraged it
- Poorly Balanced. This goes to what I said about fresh updates, the devs are always quick to pump out a new DLC or Killer or Survivor or Cosmetic, rather they do this for money or genuinely think their brothel for poor balance of a game IS balanced, I don't know, But what I do know is 90% of the updates are nerfing things that don't need it, and buffing thing's that don't need it, and overall the constant adding of new perks has gotten ridiculous , you know how hard it is to learn as a new player what perks and killers are worth BUYING and spending time on when there's so many perks and half of them suck?
- Pay to Progress. Pretty much pay to win if you want a even somewhat fair chance, Prepare to spend roughly 300$ to get all the characters

So overall, if you can handle all these flaws, go gettem tiger, I suggest getting this game on sale and save the rest for your new characters.
If you wanting a competitive  game, I don't recommend, not because it lacks competition but it's so unbalanced and based off luck, it involves little skill and makes it dull.
If you want a silly game to goof off with friends and viewers? It can be pretty fun

So overall summary: It's unbalanced and a big money pit for mediocre game play that is only tolerable with friends and not to be viewed from a skill based competitive point of view. 4/9",1668812435,1704607070,False,3,0,0.508641541004180908,1,True,False,False

For a new player (especially for killer sided), this game is a nightmare waiting to be unleash on an unexpected soul. 

The amount of grind you have to endure is insane, even though they changed it to be much easier but it will be quite a grind to do if you want to unlock those perks you want to use. Starter perks/characters for survivors are decent but for killer is pretty much garbage (there are some good perks but pretty limited).

Most characters are lock behind paid-wall but you can get it quite cheap if you wait for those discounts or you can grind to unlock but it's not really worth the time.

The game experience is really random, you can get a good game with funny moments but it also make you question your own insanity and anger issue sometimes. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME SOLO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN (it might be fun for you but for me is a big no-no).

When you see a community as bad as this one, whom insult who is basically their patriarch and voice of reason and wisdom (Otzdarva), and see the same Developers of the game ignoring him nonstop and his ideas to make the game a more enjoyable place, the SAME person who has basically given them most of their popularity, you can already imagine how bad it has gotten, new players leave immediately, and it is obvious why.

This game is no longer worth it, pick something better to interest yourself in, its future is looking as dry as ever, I started playing when this was somewhat of a small company itself, but right now it is comfortably sitting at 1.3K employees, doing absolutely nothing to help the game or its community, I can't even fathom how they can make nothing work, neither the directives at Behaviour, their Devs, or even their social workers when DBD Mobile has gotten so much stuff we've requested for years to no end, the last QnA made sure to show us where their real interests are in: And clearly developing the game in a healthy way Isn't in their plans, and won't be anytime soon.

I never had a bright hope for this game ever since the beginning, neither I thought the Devs were competent at any point or that it deserved all the popularity it got, but this is the point of no return, I'm sorry you had to go through all of that Otz, if you ever read this review, I'm truly sorry.",1703118977,1704558809,False,5,0,0.545890927314758301,0,True,False,False

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless u are some lunatic who enjoys pain and constant humiliation. In this game we introduce you to the most toxic little pricks who have been summoned from the depths of Chernobyl, Killers who are either mentally insane or just depressed people who are probably considering suicide if they lose the match and get mocked by toxic survivors who wear their badge of toxicity like a proud soldier. This game is a creation by Satan himself and hails deep from hell. Touch this game and u probably will never ever, be nice again.... It's players are a literal mix of morons, toxic little shits and more... it's funny that the Dev group of the game is called behaviour cause the only thing that they are causing is behaviour issues for its player base as u obviously may have noticed. The sad part is that the player's go all on out towards the killer or survivor, Literally no remorse and they completely forget that the other player is a human who at the end of the day can read the sh*t they spew out in chat. 

If this game continues being like this, I really don't know if this game will ever stay alive for  long, just like the moron who found the audacity to mock me in end game chat. If i find this person the things i will do this incel of a human is something i cannot explain. i will do a stunt on this guy's dead corpse and laugh every second while i do it and force his family to watch in pure and raw horror. As soon as i am done BHVR Headquarters is my next destination. Before I arrive BHVR Headquarters will be thriving, with ""developers"" and ""teams"" who only worry about money. After i am done with my business at their headquarters i will walk out of it being a ghost town. Now its time for the killers i have played against as a survivor. To every killer who has tunneled me and made my gameplay unenjoyable May God strike you down and have you get ruthlessly stabbed up in a dark alley i wish nothing but the worst for you along with this.

Hereby i give my last and final message once again targeted to the toxic half breed incel roach moronic sick in the head players i have played against: If i find you i will bodyslam you so hard and punch you so fkn hard that i knock the wind out of you and have you bleeding, roughed up and beaten to a pulp with your jaw broken and your face beaten beyond recognition. May no one ever love you again you stupid waste of oxygen and human seed.

Er, mi scusi? The game that I paid for in more ways than one is telling me I cannot play the game with an offline status? Just great. Fine, I'll play along. So I do, then what?
Oh, well, turns out it doesn't fucking matter if you have your status as online or not and I can't play it either way. So I spend a day looking on forums for help, only to get one dissatisfying and, for all intents and purposes, useless answer. ""It's a well-known bug.""

Game's probably in the best state it's been in since release, but devs fix shit at a snails pace and don't listen to the community. Many issues go ignored for way longer than is reasonable and at least in my opinion, it's reached an unacceptable level. On a more subjective note, killer designs have been pretty bad for at least a year, maybe more. Every killer past Blight (released September 2020) has ranged in design quality from ""meh"" to ""downright horrible"", with the notable exclusion of Albert Wesker in August of 2022, although Wesker has his own problems still. Overall I think the game could be fun for you and if you get it on sale and really want to try I won't say that's a bad idea, but I don't think it's worth putting time into a game where horrible balance issues go unaddressed for years, despite near 100% agreement by the community that a problem exists (*cough**cough* blight addons *cough**cough*).",1579901549,1704391724,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know I've met plenty of those type of people. But the game is just too toxic. It feels less like a game and more like a job sometimes. The matchmaking is terrible, bugs that make the game frustrating that are never fixed, a meta that requires you to spend money if you want to be at the top, and you will never go a day without seeing a cheater. The worst part to me is the developers. They just never seem to listen to player feedback. Ever. They seem like really nice people and I wish them the best, but if there is a toxic un-fun meta, give it at least 3 months before they even look into the issue.

It's by far still the best asymmetric multiplayer game out there. That being said, the game's updates is causing things to go downhill fast. Ever since the Knight was introduced the game has been steadily going downhill. Every new killer is more broken than the last and every new perk is more exploitable than the last. It feels like the survivors get nerfed every update and the killers get buffed every update. It is becoming essentially impossible to win as a survivor in public lobbies. Lately the generator placement has become abysmal with 4 (out of 7) generators able to spawn next to eachother. If you are thinking of playing this game alone as a survivor it's not worth buying, even if you become very skilled you will lose because the game is stacked against you. If the dev's finally get around to making the game playable again for survivors I'll change my review, but if you're seeing this, they haven't.

Pro's:
* One of the best asymmetrical multiplayer games on the market. (even though that might not be for too much longer)
* Great variety of killers, survivors and playstyles.
* Can be played in short bursts of 20-30 minutes.
* Extremely fun with friends. (Near impossible without)
* Fun events that happen frequently.

Cons:
* Survivors become worse every update.
* Killers become stronger every update.
* There's no way to counter many of the new killer's abilities. (Example: Skull merchant will punish the survivors for trying anything and can lock off large sections of the map causing you to essentially sacrifice yourself for precious seconds of generator time.)
* Because some killers are so broken nobody can play as them, because entire lobbies will quit as soon as they know they're playing against a broken killer.
* The devs only listen to influential content creators, which means that the casual player's voice is unheard. Which is why casual play is becoming more and more difficult.",1704388992,1704388992,False,11,2,0.582899808883666992,3,True,False,False

They've successfully ruined every universal good perk for survivor whilst powering up MULTIPLE killer perks in the process. It feels very non-interactive to be on a killers shoulder as all the perks for that have either been removed or nerfed so now they can walk a mile with a survivor on their shoulder with no fear of the wiggle timer. You can run like 2 exhaustion perks now because every other exhaustion perk has beyond niche triggers that are in no way realistic to consistently trigger which makes for stale perk design. They've ruined EVERY strong healing perk you are TROLLING if you go ANY healing perks as they've removed a solo player from being able to heal UNLESS you waste your item slot on the 1 free in game heal(also troll to do). The flashlight once coveted as a rare and powerful item is now ALSO considered troll to bring as its lost  a considerable amount of strength from release and all in all it doesn't seem like the devs are in any hurry to fix the serious problems with DBD I play both Killer and Survivor at the highest possible level and I have to say I genuinely dread playing survivor, its not fun, there's not many diverse strong perks, there's no fun items, and its just a grueling experience that I'm thankful I don't put myself through anymore, the power creep of most of the killers from origin to now have completely thrown me off as well. Killer might have been harder than survivor in like season 5 when there were only like 5 killers but now the game has evolved to an entire roster of new power creep that leaves the borderline perk-less survivor at an insurmountable disadvantage thanks to most killers being able to out survivors without having to worry about hooking(i.e. wiggle timer, killer perks, or unique mechanics which allow you to auto hook) 
Killer also has its draw backs but dont worry the devs are really fighting for killer to be as strong as it can possibly be. I used to love playing this game solo but now its BEYOND too easy to play killer to the point I get bored after 3 matches and survivor is just EXTREMELY unfun do to the lack of care towards survivor as it was semi-oppressive in the past due to a much larger and more skilled player base per capita. Nowadays a shell of its former self, I will now delete DBD for the first time ever as I feel each update has regressed the game to a far more unhealthy state than its ever been. Hope any devs see this and actually care to fix the game. STOP making little Lgbtq flag decorations and start making the game healthier and more enjoyable for what little player base you retained after your tenor. GG all. Hopefully these devs stop caring about sexuality and start caring about their game as for me, Ill never know fk u behavior youre all idiots that dont even play your own game because if you did youd realize how piss it is and how you all are at maintaining it. cya .",1586386338,1704360000,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: The game is unplayable in its current state.

No relevant movement abilities, an over-abundance of pallet-negating killers/perks, and a reduction to the amount of loops shortens the length of chases - making the game so much easier for killers. Killers like Skull Merchant just set up AI to gen-lock. Too many killers with TP abilities to camp gens, bajillion move speed. If you're not always on a gen, you will most likely TPK.

[b]Asymmetry[/b]

Imagine that you are paired up with 3 other people in order to repair 5 generators so that you can open one of the two gates available to escape the area. While doing this there is a killer lurking in the shadows and patrolling the surrounding area looking for you. As they are getting closer there is music you hear - a musical theme that is getting ever louder as the killer is getting closer since you are in their so-called terror radius. The most exciting part is the final layer of this music which plays during the chase sequence.

You can stun the killer with pallets or flashlights but can never really defeat them. If a chase ensues you need to make sure it lasts the longest possible time so that your team mates have time to finish the reparation. When hit you gain adrenaline to run faster for a while but you leave pools of blood and also make a noise due to the wounds you have. You are an easier target now but you still need to press on. As the second hit comes crashing down you find yourself on the ground and the killer can pick you up and hook you. Your team mates now need to decide who will get to you and become a lifesaver risking to become the next victim. Every person must be hooked 3 times to perish. A creature with tentacles descends from the sky to take you elsewhere once and for all when this happens.

[b]A license haven[/b]

This is even more exciting if you love horror and are familiar with the many horror franchises out there with perhaps particular emphasis on the slasher genre. The killer can be Myers from Halloween or Ghostface from the Scream franchise. You can try to outrun the Xeno from the Alien or play hide-and-seek with Bubba from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You can try to avoid Amanda from Saw to put beartraps on your head or reject the offer from Cenobite who has [i]such sights to show you[/i]. You can seek out alarm clocks to wake up from Freddy Krueger's nightmares or avoid Chucky because you don't want to be [i]friends 'til the end[/i].

But there's more! We have gaming licenses here, too. You can avoid the tentacles of Nemesis or Wesker's dashes - both of them set out to infect you during the match. Survivors can also be familiar to you from these licenses. It's fun hunting down Ripley with the Xeno or Cheryl with Pyramid Head. The game is not short of original licenses the creators came up with. There is a robot that can use pods to track you and teleport to start a chase and there is even a knight who sends out ghosts patrolling the area.

[b]More info on the gameplay[/b]

There are several maps out there and some are tied in with the licenses such as the Racoon City PD or the Nostromo Wreckage. Items can be taken to matches to help us with the speed of reparation or healing fellow survivors. Characters can be upgraded with the Blood Points we get (consider it the XP in this game) and each one can be prestiged after level 50. Both survivors and killers come with 3 unique abilities (perks) that can be unlocked for others if we do at least one prestiging. But you also have general perks available (not tied to characters) and it should be noted that everyone has 4 slots so you can create a lot of interesting builds since there are more than 70 characters (more than 30 on each side).

Now, the fun part is how you play from the 3rd person (as survivor) but the killer has a 1st person perspective. For killers the add-ons (2 slots) are not for items but modifiers that can enhance or change their powers. Each side can also take an offering to the match - this can be a request to play on a specific level or just something that gives a boost percentage to the BP earned.

Some killers are fast, others can teleport through walls, some can move stealthily and many require you to do other things during the match. You can disarm traps, use clocks to wake yourself up, cleanse yourself from infection or use either a vaccine or a spray to cure yourself from a virus. There is no built-in voice chat but you can only use a few gestures to give others orders. You have to pay attention to the left-hand side of the screen that shows what your fellow survivors are doing. You can see who is in a chase and you can always see the auras of those on a hook. 

[b]What if I'm a new player?[/b]

Prepare for a lot to learn. The game was released more than 7 years ago and a lot of content has been added. A small amount of characters are available but the rest must be purchased. For original characters a special currency (shards) can be earned so by playing a lot you can purchase a lot of characters and even many outfits. Now, this is a game that uses the [i]game as a service model[/i] approach. In every season we get new characters (there is a new chapter) and rifts open up for purchase which essentially means for a small fee we can receive a lot of cosmetics but only for specific characters. There is a lot of terminology for you to learn: you need to know what status effects there are and their meaning and many more. 

[b]Toxicity[/b]

This is why I'm downvoting this game. The playerbase is awful. After a match - regardless of the outcome - people say hurtful things to you. They consider you a cheater if you have won as a killer or your survivor friends look down on you if you did not play well and it was your gameplay that doomed the entire team. You can crouch repeatedly during a match to tea-bag the killer. The killers, in return, can camp / tunnel / slug that are all nasty (but efficient) tactics to win a match. Some offences you come across are simply not punishable. If you decide to report someone you need to 1) make a report in-game 2) submit a ticket on the developer's website and 3) upload video evidence as proof of the cheat, harassment or unsportsmanlike attitude you have come across.

The reporting system is very time consuming and - due to privacy reasons - you only get confirmation on when your ticket was actioned. Some players even upload a screenshot on their temporary bans as they consider it funny. Forums here on the Steam can be just as toxic - the official forum on the developer's website is much better but moderation is done regularly as it is a must.

The game's matchmaking system is broken - it is very easy to be paired with players that are thousands of hours ahead of you. With survivors climbing ranks it is especially difficult since you alone cannot win a match - you need the others but with lack of experience the so-called SoloQ experience can be painful. Killers can find matches difficult and sweaty just the same. Friends can team up and use voice communication (e.g. Discord) and have a coordinated match against the killer. Some of these SWF (Survive With Friends) groups tend to remain after the match and bully the 5th individual in the chat. The killer then will resort to slugging / camping etc. in the following match... it generates an unstoppable avalanche. Swearwords are common in the chat and ""+rep"" or ""-rep"" messages will quickly fill up your wall if your profile is public. 

[b]Summary[/b]

DbD is an amazing game. Running from killers as Nicolas Cage or Ash from Evil Dead can be pure fun. Opening the gate but heading back with 2 others to save the 4th individual who's struggling for their life on the hook can be one of the most memorable experiences in this game. There are some expert players out there (many also stream regularly) and the learning curve is there and it is very steep.

But the game has a lot of issues. New characters with their new perks always shake up the meta. The developers also make decisions that slightly alter the game mechanics. And there are killers such as Freddy in the roster that haven't been upgraded for years. I downvote DbD due to its community. This game requires a lot and I mean a LOT of patience to deal with toxicity. Who knows: you may get hooked (pun intended).",1704334898,1704335775,False,134,6,0.756948351860046387,41,True,False,False

The ""power creep"" of these newer killers gets worse and worse. They just mash multiple effects on top of one another and expect the game to be in a healthy state. On the survivor side of things though, the gen popping capability is so INSANE now that most killers will just play for a 3 gen from the start of the match. Multiple matches the server shut down because neither side was willing to give it up. The health of this game is bad at this point. Maps are getting too small, generator progress is too quick, even with the change to anti-camp it is has stopped nothing from getting tunneled out extremely quickly. But hey, they did a cross over with Ubisoft's R6 Siege....another broken dumpster fire of a game...so that says a lot

Edit: Now having played this game for years. I have to say that it is in an awful spot. Micro-transactions are the key focus of this game at this point. Cosmetics and Rift passes are more important than actual balancing. Every game as survivor is you facing the same 3 top tier killers every match and still getting facecamped or tunneled so you spend 5 minutes loading into a match to play for 2 minutes. The toxicity of this game is at an all time high. Survivors are just as bad as they go into to bully low tier killers and players. This game was fun at one point but has thus become a competitive breeding ground of small PP energy people competing to see who can ruin who's time better.

The game is great. I switched over from Xbox and restarted the grind. I hated it at first but it was worth it. I love hating myself as I get facecamped and tunneled every match. Or when I play killer i get the worst maps ever for the killer i choose while getting cocky survivors BM'ing me at every turn.

first with the few positive stuff: events and tomes are a great way of keeping players entertained while earning points and cosmetics. cool i guess. also the wide variety of killers is on paper pretty nice.

well now to the rest. never have i played a game where the devs are so unambitious and lazy. it kind of disgusts me how there basically is a tier list with 2 killers having their own tiers. talking about 'changing up the meta' when these 2 also enjoy having good addons while other killers suffer from a horrendous choice of VIABLE addons. how is it even possible that the same shit dominates the game for years without any changes coming in the future? meanwhile theres a new feng min skin every week? 
then theres perks. not even half are anywhere near viable. theres a handful good ones. then theres some that are niche/decent at best but have some kind of downside that makes them trash tier. theres 0 thought process behind it. the only reason this game is not dead yet is licensed killers.
devs clearly dont care about balance its just skins and dlcs nothing else thats in their head. buffles me we still cant see other people's loadout. plus the bridge between swf's and soloq survivors is TOO HUGE. the devs basically said they dont care in their recent Q&A on reddit. no plans on solving any of these issues. but hey new horror game with among us character is coming out !!! 
i'm salty as hell but that doesnt change the fact that these issues do exist and the devs already stated there'll be no plans to change any problems many people already complained about. 

its kind of sad. this game has potential. but greed and laziness ruins it

Game is full of hackers now at the mid to high ranks and Behaviour actively protects them by allowing them to hide their usernames so you can no longer submit proof of hacking. Some people think there aren't hackers, but that's because they don't get into high enough MMR to play against them.  Hackers usually win so they play at a higher tier of matchmaking. The hacks range from slight speed or aura reading hacks that are impossible to prove, to hackers that can fly and shoot oneshot hatchets or instantly pick themselves up or go underneath the map and take the game hostage. Your only way out is to DC but if you DC too many times you get banned from matchmaking and the ban gets longer and longer each time you DC.

If you don't believe me go watch Otzdarva's stream and you'll see hackers every day.  He encounters so many hackers that he is actually forced to play against them because his DC penalty is getting too high, and he only DCs against hackers. 

If you even bring up that hackers exist in the discord or forums or pretty much anywhere that Behaviour controls, they'll ban you for mentioning it.

It's addictive and it's fun to play with friends once you have some hours under your belt and stop caring so much about hiding in corners to survive. Once you develop the knowhow to run bully squads against killers, it's a blast. With that said, there have been a number of changes. Namely, about 18 months ago(I'm guessing on the timeline) they suspended the penalty for disconnects(they wouldn't let you load into a game for a few minutes if you DC from one as a penalty). Ever since then, DC's have slowly grown. It has gotten so bad and so frequent that they had to create bots to take over for the players that DC, which is actually not a terrible idea. But something else we're seeing is teammates killing themselves to create a 3v1 scenario instead of a 4v1, which makes the game tremendously harder. Just to be clear: when I started playing 4 years ago this almost never happened. Once every few dozen matches you'd encounter this. Now, it's LITERALLY 30-50% of all matches played. On top of that, what they have gotten in the habit of doing, is releasing killers that are TOO STRONG. They do this to gain a large number of sales for the new killer, and then they nerf the killer making them more balanced. I'm all for a balanced killer, but it's awfully convenient that they run the PTB and rule the killer as perfectly balanced, but 2 weeks after the launch(once they've made a ton of money off of selling this too strong killer) now the killer is suddenly out of control and they nerf it. This is definitely a money grab. On top of that, they have a few maps that they haven't touched since release(years ago), yet they are updating onces that came out 1 year ago.

With all of that said, I clearly spent 3,000 hours on the game, and I think it's one of the best games I have ever played, but I will be taking a break from it. There is nothing new enough or fresh enough to keep me around, and I feel like the developers AND the community made some wrong turns that have encouraged play that is becoming increasingly detrimental to the experience of the game.

This is a decent game and also not. It's fun when you're doing well, not so fun when you're not. It's fun when you're very new or have 6000h in the game. Not so much in the middle area though. There is only 1 game mode, where you can be either a killer or a survivor, basically every match consists of 4 survivors fixing 5 generators, then opening the exit gate to escape - with the killer trying to hang them on hooks and kill them. It can be fun at times, I've enjoyed it quite a bit - though it can feel VERY repetitive. Also, after reaching the highest rank on either Killer/Survivor (Or reached maximum prestige (level)), you don't really feel any point in playing in that position anymore - kinda annoying as I bought the ghostface DLC and barely ended up using it.

Additionally, a [b]huge[/b] problem with this game is matchmaking - matches are supposedly ""MMR-reliant"", but the devs' implementation of it is pretty terrible - someone with 15 mins in the game may be matched with a random number of people, with maybe 2000h as I've experienced many times. This, especially when playing killer, makes it annoying and not fun. As well as this, the community is a bit more toxic than average - they'll do anything to win: griefing camping killers and utility abusing torch survivors. This can be painful at the start but you get used to it and have to live with it, you can improve from it too. As well as this the player reporting system almost always requires you to go onto their website and report the same player AGAIN rather than just doing it in-game.

Yes, it's a fun game, but gets boring and repetitive, can become a money trap easily too.

There are bugs & glitches galore with this game, this game is more unpolished than my kitchen floor yet instead of fixing the bugs and the issues, the core fundamental issues with the game, they want to add MORE stuff to the game which ultimately means even more bugs & glitches.

After 7,000+ hours in this game (whether mostly survivor or not is irrelevant) I can safely say without a doubt this game is NOT worth full price. They care more for making money than making a good game which is deeply saddening. The game is HORRIFICALLY unbalanced. Was back in 2016, and still is now. While I admit i started playing in 2018 even I felt like the game was quite heavily survivor sided and even more so to this present day. Back then there was some semblance of decency to this game & you could enjoy it. But the player base is by FAR the most toxic I've ever experienced, even more so than Rust! There are even people who will go as far as to call you a..... child liker, to use an expression. A malicious attempt to destroy peoples credibility and lives potentially. I have one person who harasses me with these false accusations myself.

As said the game is HEAVILY unbalanced & in favour of the survivors, but high MMR is nothing but meta on BOTH sides. Or the games are filled with people that just want to be really unpleasant, whether its constant toxicity from survivors to killers, or killers willing to grief you, 4 minute slug you or constantly hit you on hook. I've been maliciously targeted by MANY of these ""Griefers"" as survivor and unpleasant people and its made my gaming experience from September 2021 to March 2023 an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE AND MISERY. Their customer service is also downright disgraceful, when I report griefers, or hackers, nothing gets done.

Occasionally there can be some nice fun games in this, and when you have wholesome moments in DBD and meme times in this game they are usually some of the best you'll ever have, but are too few and far between for me to justify giving a recommendation here, and the fact there are SO MANY bugs and glitches, and quite a few hackers too which BHVR either wilfully ignores or just plainly cant be bothered to fix it further validates the latter point.

All and all this game has the potential to be 10/10 quality, but the developers legit just throw it all away with their content before quality approach, their greed, and lack of caring for the DBD community. Sadly I can only give it a 2. I CANNOT forgive the companies poor ethics, lack of care for the game, and incompetence in a lot of other areas as well.",1561846573,1704195387,False,0,0,0.469696968793869019,0,True,False,False

1. 치트 유저가 너무 많습니다. 클로즈 베타때부터 쭉 했던 사람이면 알겠지만 치트 유저들 자기가 티 안나게 치트 쓴다고 생각하는데 다 보입니다. 거기에 대놓고 치트 쓰는 유저들 까지 합치면 그 수가 압도적으로 많아요.
2. 이상한 사람들이 너무 많아요. 오투잼, 디제이맥스 정도를 제외한 리듬게임을 주로 파는 사람들을 보면 거의 일베나 디씨같은 악질 익명커뮤니티를 하더라구요. 거기에 데드 바이 데이라이트도 추가하면 되겠습니다. 또 애니 프사는 과학이라고 하죠? 실제로 이 게임을 하면서 상대 프로필을 확인해보면 애니 프사+듣보잡 리듬 게임+이상한 씹덕 게임들을 보유한 유저가 매우 많습니다. 치트 유저나 트롤 유저 프로필을 보면 99% 저 상태라고 보시면 돼요.
3. 앞서 말한 경우가 한국인들도 많지만 그 나라애들이 압도적으로 많아요. 그래서 일본섭으로 가도 의미가 없는게 그 나라애들은 어디에나 있습니다. 그 나라애들은 그 나라의 일베, 디씨를 할 뿐 똑같습니다. 결국 게임을 할 수가 없어요. 익명 기능을 없애고 차단한 유저와 게임을 못하도록 만들어주지 않는 이상 게임을 제대로 즐길 수 없습니다.
4. 밸런스가 매우 안맞습니다. 킬러의 종류가 많지만 너스, 스피릿, 블라이트 삼대장과 현재 레이스, 해골 상인만 99% 등장합니다. 생존자 돌리면 현재 킬러가 저렇게만 나옵니다. op 3대장은 말할 것도 없고 레이스, 해골 상인은 초보자도 날먹 플레이를 가능하게 해줘서 자신 없는 유저들이 픽하고 생존자 중에 초보들만 골라서 캠핑 터널링을 하는데 이러면 또 초보들은 즐기지 못하고 저런 킬러들만 양산하고 악순환입니다. 그럼 킬러를 하면 되지 않느냐구요? 킬러하면 치트 유저 때문에 또 못합니다. 저 같은 경우 생존자들이 게임을 즐기는 걸 좋아해서 고스트 페이스, 마이클 마이어스, 사다코, 피그, 처키를 주로 플레이하는데 이런 뚜벅이 킬러는 특히 생존자가 치트를 쓰는게 더 잘 보입니다. 상대가 ESP나 스피드 치트를 쓴다는걸 바로 느낄 수 있어요. 심증이 아니냐구요? 최근엔 그래도 신고하면 자체 팀이 꾸려졌는지 조치 내용이 자주 뜹니다.

이 게임을 오래 즐기셨던분이라면 공감 하실거에요. 공감을 안하고 화를 낸다? 그런 사람이 근처에 있다? 그럼 위의 1, 2번 경우에 해당하니 거르시면 됩니다.

A majority of the my time has been as a killer main, where I've played all of the killers released so far to varying degrees. I have played a bit of survivor, but due to solo queue being a bit frustrating at times and not having many friends that play I avoid survivor for the most part.

Would I recommend Dead by Daylight as a great game? Yea I think the game is fun, even better with friends, but what really caught my attention was how different the game play is in comparison to basically any other game on the market. Essentially Dead by Daylight is, from an outsiders point of view, an asymmetrical horror game where one player is the ""killer"" and the other four are the survivors. The survivors objective is to repair generators to power the exit gates, opening them and escaping, while the killers entire goal is the prevent this from happening by downing survivors and placing them on the sacrificial hooks around the map. 

This is unfortunately only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the game, and one of the main reasons this game is so difficult for new players. When it comes down to it, this game is a in-depth time management game, where you must ensure you are being as efficient as possible with your actions and time to beat the other team. The Killer role feels this more so than survivor, but regardless you want to ensure your overall objective is progressing faster than the other sides whether that be hooking survivors or completing generators. 

The most entertaining and fun portion of the game is the chase. This happens when a killer locates a survivor and makes the decision to start chasing them. This ultimately dictates the flow of the game, as survivors who play things safe, utilize mind games, and waste the killers time to an appropriate degree put pressure on the killer as there will be 3 other survivors who ""should"" be applying time to the objectives. If a killer is great, understands the game, and knows when to drop chase to pressure other objectives instead of wasting their time chasing a survivor that understands how to waste your time, they can usually mitigate mistakes and quickly find the weak links on the other team.

Overall, if you are a new player, this game isn't easy. Honestly its very difficult and skill sets from other games don't really transfer over well so you will be starting from scratch. You will lose a lot, and probably get frustrated on what your doing wrong, but once you start understanding the game better and put more hours into it, its honestly come a long way and as of this review the game is probably more balanced than its ever been. Look to content creators like Otzdarva for guides and recommendations when your getting started and don't take the game too seriously.

My gripes from 2022 have largely been addressed by the devs. The game is the most balanced it has ever been (despite content creators insisting otherwise) and the last year of patches has been overwhelmingly positive. This game is worth playing currently and I have adjusted my recommendation accordingly. Please see my original two reviews below for additional information. 













______________________________________________________________

April 2022 Review:

My original review is at the bottom. The thoughts there are still true even after 2k hours. However, I am changing my recommendation to no because of the current state of the game (April 2022). 

Ever since the MMR update the game has changed dramatically. Every match feels precisely the same as the previous, only seeing a handful of the over 20 killer roster each match. Every game is an exercise in frustration, whether it be getting camped, getting tunneled, or seeing survivors just holding forward. Not running meta perks leads to ""no fun allowed"" scenarios, resulting in feeling forced to bring specific perks just to mitigate the risk of not being able to play the game.  

I have ZERO hope the devs will fix this fundamental flaw because of the history with balancing patches and feature introduction in this game. Instead of listening to feedback and adjusting things in a healthy way, the devs often double down on terrible fixes or nerfs that don't fix the fundamental issue with the things being adjusted. Whether this be perk changes, killer tweaks, you name it, the developers often miss the mark and would rather behave like children when the fans that love this game offer CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. I do not expect them to produce perfect patch after perfect patch but the current game lacks any kind a variety in builds (ironic considering there is over 100+ perks, over 20 killers, and dozens of maps in the game) and MMR has made every game a sweatfest of epic proportions.

I play this game because it is fun. The current product is everything but that and I cannot recommend jumping aboard this sinking ship. Proper competition may eventually reach the market but as of now this game is becoming a victim of its own success with no hope left in sight.

Original review:

I was hesitant to get this game at first because I couldn't quite understand what makes it so popular. Tried it for the first time on a free weekend and instantly fell in love. The game really captures the essence of being a hopeless survivor (when playing alone) or a brutal killer. Each killer has variety and a unique identity that defines them.

Hooks are like 4 meters apart from each other and makes it impossible for you to wiggle out, at this point Behaviour should remove the wiggle feature because it's actually useless and you can barely get past half of the wiggle progress, toolboxes are also pointless because they do not remove the hook completely or at least make it have a longer cooldown before respawning.
Medkits are ALSO PRETTY USELESS and the rarity ONLY CHANGES THE SPEED YOU HEAL OTHER PEOPLE?? WHAT? WHY???? WHY CHANGE SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT BROKEN??
The new killer Chucky can barely be seen or heard while he's in the grass. The cooldown and the hitbox of slice and dice make his power absolutely broken and overpowered.
Every killer in basically every match is either using Nowhere to Hide or Ultimate Weapon or even both which makes you scream and give away your position and the only thing to counter them is using Distorsion and/or Calm Spirit which take 2 perk slots from you instead of having actually good perks to either help you or your team to actually win the match.
Oh and also did I forgot to mention that generators are also close to one another just like hooks??? If you happen to repair generators in the perfect pattern so the killer will be left with 3 generators next to each other you are absolutely fxked.

Todo list for Behaviour and their underpaid employees:
- Fix your fxking game and maybe the upcoming updates and fixes will actually make the game better not worse
- Bring back the old med kits
- Do something with the hooks so they are less of them or not that close to one another
- The anti camping mechanism is so bad the killer can stay at the perfect range to not fill up the bar but just close enough to get you if you manage to get unhooked
- You can still tunnel the sh!t out of a survivor and still win the game when the other survivors are repairing generators
- There are also some areas of some maps which have either 1 pallet or 1 window and dropping that pallet makes the whole entire area of the map completely useless and if you happen to have a generator there good luck trying to escape because there is no pallet or window near you to escape",1606589133,1704133515,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Just imagine looking up a political forum for discussion, except instead of people screeching back-and-forth about healthcare reform or something, it's about how your low-tier fun variety loadout is actually unbeatable homogenized S tier meta, and how 1 of the only 2 roles in the game is actually at an inherent disadvantage, so it's only fair for them to min-max with like $30 worth of DLC meta perks combined.

The game is balanced around every survivor having no voice/text chat at all, but there's a mode that lets you play with friends (which allows you to be in a voice call with them), thus allowing survivors to gain an unreasonable advantage while invalidating 40% of the loadout options based around coordination with people half-way across the map, meanwhile BHVR refuses to acknowledge the existence of voice calls outside the game by refusing to enable any form of mid-round text or voice chat for survivors playing with randoms.

55% of the killers in the game are ""perk killers"" who you just dump a bunch of grindy progression resources into for 1-2 of their perks to use on every character, since the actual killer is boring to play, or just does the same thing as a different killer, but worse. 35% are fun but badly underpowered. 10% of the killers are overpowered to the point that at higher ranks, you'll just see the same 5~ killers over and over, invalidating the whole point of having such a massive list of killers.

There are many other issues, and the last 70~ hours of me playing this game were filled with thoughts of ""surely BHVR will fix one of the many 3 year old issues soon right?????"". they won't. every update makes the game worse by adding more bugs or more shit you have to buy to keep up with the powercreep. There was a scandal in like 2017ish where one of the game's DIRECTORS tried to play an underpowered killer to prove a point about how they were balanced, and didn't manage to kill a single survivor. I go to the video today, i scroll down, what do i see? ""[12 days ago] Thats why DBD became Killer sided that much""

Can't go through one thread devoted to this game without ""BHVR makes the game survivor/killer sided, of course, survivor/killer mains won't admit it..."" 
Oxford languages decribes a bigot as ""a person who is obstinately or unreasonably attached to a belief, opinion, or faction, especially one who is prejudiced against or antagonistic toward a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular group."" At the risk of sounding like an asshole for even using the word ""bigot"" to begin with, 80% of this game's community are ignorant bigots drowning out any hope of a pleasant social interaction with someone not on your side of killer/survivor. The way the progression system works, instead of getting (as a made up example) 5 survivor perk points, and 5 killer perk points per round, you get 10 perk points, so you're encouraged to invest all your perk points into one role, therefore reducing the amount of people who equally play both roles. This game teaches you to hate people whose shoes you can't step into.",1704103538,1704104933,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes some things definitely feel unfair one way or another, but I assure you they do seem to eventually touch up on most issues or complaints you may find.",1704061626,1704061626,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1484667453
The moderators for Dead by Daylight are incompetent children. I got permanent banned for ‘editing my save file’?

Look at the upload dates for the videos & the screenshots below, as I have never changed my save file. The most I’ve ever done, is copy the save file & paste it elsewhere on my hard drive in case I ever lost it (like we were told to do a while back in this thread from a developer) - 
https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1843493219431981208/  

These videos (below) say they’re published on 8/18/2018 as I opened them to public then to show everyone my progression, but they were uploaded on the day I say they were, I took several screenshots showing this from the youtube page. You can probably tell by the older UI and the older perk icons with the thicker black border anyway, but I’m showing everyone my old progress & that it hasn’t changed drastically over several months. You can even see the date in the bottom right hand corner of my computer screen before I open the game in the videos.

Like I said, I’ve never edited my save file. I have no reason to (2000+ hours). In the video (8/18/2018), I still only have the two killer legacy’s that I earned. The videos show this. The screenshots show this. Look at the upload date on my screenshots. The most I’ve done to my save file is copy and paste it elsewhere on my hard drive (like we players were told to do) when the save-erase bug was going around. I still don’t understand what part of my save file was ‘changed’ or ‘edited’ as I’ve never done anything to my save other than what was greenlit by the developers themselves.

I’ve never been given a direct answer. They don’t have a direct answer because their moderator team is full of immature narcissistic apes with a superiority complex who are ban-happy with whoever they feel like & nobody calls them out on it.

I'm showing anyone who's interested my progression over the past two years & I don't understand what is it that I'm accused to have 'changed'. I’ve been a part of this game since before the beta, pre-ordered the game, bought every DLC, spent money on Auric Cells, & now I’m being permanently banned for something I didn’t even do? Even after I'm showing everyone all of my progression over 2 years? 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1487420814&fileuploadsuccess=1

After continuing to request information on my ban, the (unpaid) moderator team of Dead by Daylight took it upon themselves to completely delete my support ticket.

Putrid waste of time & a vile company.

The game contains pay-to-win elements that make the game unenjoyable when you start, and there are many paid characters.

Also I play this game at least 2 times a day or less and it is not super addicting and the only money you have to pay is getting the game but if you want cosmetics you have to pay for that. And the other thing i like about this is you don't have to pay to get survivors or even killers you can just grind the game and get whatever killer or survivor you want but you can also buy survivors or killers as a DLC or in game. I hope you have a wonderful time playing this game but if you don't wan to but this game it is fine but I think you should but this game anyways have a wonderful day.,1703996745,1703996745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 Killer side also fun, me be big scary monster, chase survivors, hook them for sacrifice. Lots of different killers, each with special power. Me like feeling powerful, crush survivors like bug. 

But community big problem. Some players be mean, toxic. Me want fun game, not fight with others. Some survivors teabag, taunt, make caveman mad. Me just want enjoy game, not deal with bad people.

Dead by Daylight, fix game! Make fair for everyone. Me want happy caveman, not upset about imbalances and toxic players. Game have potential, but need improvement. Me still play, but me grumble about problems",1615696911,1703996216,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I can't quite work out whether I prefer being a survivor or a killer, but either way it's an enjoyable experience that gets the heart racing a bit. As a total noob there is a lot to learn, but the learning curve seems to be a small one as I haven't really struggled as either role just yet. It's interesting to see how many streamers are playing it too, and they are always friendly if you pop into their chat after a match to say hello. I've made quite a few acquaintances through it already. If I have one criticism it is purely the amount of DLC's that I now want that will cost me even more £££ but really, that's just my own little FOMO thing on show.

Edited to add - the gameplay is very addictive and I regularly find myself saying ""just one more match"" only to play for several more hours.

About every degenerate you meet on this game if they aren't a total idiot are some sort of game master with enough willpower to screw you over at any moments notice, If they're ranking they're going to make sure you're damn miserable the entire game. This game makes me tear my hair out, I internally rage when I have to loop with the last survivor like I'm at some Ball party (the dancing kind, not the sports kind I don't leave the house enough for that). 

Yet somehow I keep coming back for just a little more, every-time I uninstall it I think ""This is the last time I touch it"" and it ends up back in my library like some sort of cursed artifact. I love this game it's entertaining when I get a few kills and chase the survivors, I hate this game for the exact same reason. It's like an addiction, I swear I wont come back I swear I wont touch it again but here I am, pulling up as Pyramid Head or The Cenobite despite being awful at both.

In the past it was fun with so many interesting perk builds to try out, but after a while skill based matchmaking had it so I was against the same 3 people every day with the same exactly annoying perks. Since then, they have nerfed a lot of fun interesting perks on both sides because they were too overused and good, which I don't mind, but I do feel as though this game is passed its prime. They haven't released an interesting, viable, and unique killer with a different game loop since Deathslinger. I think this game is very unforgiving to new players, but fun once you get the hang of it. I'm certain Proxy chat would be a great addition to this game both for beginners and the sweats to add the experience of getting to meet your team. Regardless they continue to update survivor perks and Items to make it more fair, but the game is a 4v1, there is always going to be some unfairness if one team decides to play a certain way. I'd personally rather see the devs spend their time creating cool new unique content and perks that are all viable rather then spending time revising and ruining old perks due to complaints. Simply there's no way to really make both sides (Surv Mains and Killer Mains) content with perk patches and time would be better invested in more quality for new content. Id still recommend the game especially if you have friends to play it with, custom games are always hilarious, and running surv squad is always fun for atleast like maybe 2 games.",1703965419,1703965419,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are some technical issues with the game where you have to go out and come back in sometimes - but it's not so bad that it makes me wanna rage quit.. but needs some fixing there (happens on occasion not often). I love being able to collect survivors/killers and costumes plus killer and survivor charms that you add to your characters for your own personalization. Many costumes take a while to save up for and many costumes cost irl money with auric cells in game.

When you climb up the ranks you only get matched with toxic survivors who have thousands of hours if you play killer or as survivor you just will die because you can't loop god tier killer who played the game for years. So yeah pretty much don't buy this game. Not balanced nor is it a horror game. It is mostly just doing the same stuff with some variation and some killers who you won't be able to counter but if you play the killer you will lose after you win a little bit. And pretty much the survivors got no empathy half the time. Just toxic evil people who deserve to be strangled but hey God can do what he deems right. And so yeah never buy this game especially since after you buy it you gotta buy other killers. Just dumb idea in general.

Well either go play against the 3000 hour Nurse or go play against the newbie survivors you kill since you are so good.

Even though I got really got both as killer and survivor the game simply isn't stable and balanced enough to let you have fun while you play. You can do a perfect game and still feel angry, so much so that after I took a one week break I actually felt better in my life in general. You can try to play casual but either a toxic killer or teammate is gonna ruin your day. And on 1 game out of 10 you're going to run into cheaters. Just stay away from this game. Play Baldur's Gate 3, The Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk 2077. Stay away from this rage inducing trash if you care about your health. Sincerely, a 600 hours player.

500 hours edit: what can I say. The game is really fun and takes a while to master both survivor and killer play styles. The main problem with this game is the community, which is really passionate but its full of bad actors. It perpetuates a cycle of toxicity as there are no consequences for acting bad towards other players, so in the next game, the bullied player becomes the bully, and it never ends, well, it ends when you close the game.

My Opinion

Dead By Daylight is a fun game that can be played solo or with friends. the game is split into 2 roles, survivors which are all fundamentally the same & killers which have unique abilities and play styles. each character will have 3 unique perks which can be taught to others once that character reaches level 50 and prestige's. this allows you to create fun and interesting perk combos. but the annoying thing i find with Dead By Daylight is you start with roughly 1/3 of the content at the start (under the assumption that you bought ultimate edition, if not you start with less) and at least 1/3 of the characters are licensed which means you NEED to spend real money to get them, with others characters being unlocked by collecting shards (which can take a LONG while. it is possible to get the perks of licensed characters for free in the ""shrine of secrets"" but from what I've seen so far, there's only 1 licensed perk per week so you could be waiting a while.

final thoughts

As fun as i find dead by daylight i can't deny the fact they push for pay 2 win. so if you do decide to get this game, get a feel for it first. dont spend money right away. there are still good characters on either side with killers having crowd control (trapper), range (huntress), speed (hillbilly & nurse) & stealth (wraith). and survivours having perks like sprint burst (extra speed) and dead hard (small window of invincibility). so get used to the game and try play with characters you have, you might find you like them and that can save you time and money. and sure you can spend your money how you want but i feel like you should only spend money on licensed dlc's, as everything else will be free after you play for long enough",1703875039,1703875039,True,1,0,0.512820541858673096,0,True,False,False

The only enjoyment you'll get from this literal shovelware is the modicum of a sense of teamwork you'll get when playing with friends, from the abysmally unbalanced game design that obviously had 10 minutes of work put into it at most, to the intentionally obtuse and boring perk system that replaces actual depth with endless amounts of worthless crap that affects nothing to a point where it's noticeable.

The matchmaking times are ridiculous, even with a team of 4 survivors it'll still take at least 10 minutes to find a killer to play against, who'll cheese you and make the game impossible to win because of the aforementioned 10 minutes of game design that a monkey with a typewriter would be ashamed to shit out on a bad day.

Don't even think about wasting your money on this unless you have a large friend group with a lot of patience who just want a way to enjoy each others' company, if I didn't I would've refunded it (and any and all times I open this game again will be at their behest).

PS: It gets marginally more enjoyable once you realize how vapid and shallow the gameplay actually is, it just boils down to knowing things like how close you have to be to vault over obstacles etc, playing as a survivor is the only bit you can even pretend to enjoy because of how heavily biased it is in favor of playing killer, if, for whatever reason, you accidentally press the ""Play As Killer"" button, you'll feel absolutely nothing when you win and in the exceptionally rare times you somehow don't sacrifice all 4 survivors you'll feel like a moron (which might explain why the ""people"" who play killer for fun and not just when they have a +100% blood point bonus to slightly speed up the absolute grind that is getting new items are so sweaty and toxic), but it's still 0/10 movie tie-in shovelware whose target audience are unassuming boomers who recognize the characters and will play it once and then forget it exists. Spend your money on literally anything else because this is still the worst game I've ever played in my entire life.

EDIT: game still sucks but it like a toxic relationship that is hard to break. sigh. 

People will say this game is amazing but the truth is it's not. 
It's bad, the whole idea is for 1 side just to piss off the other without trying to make them DC. 

Matchmaking is shit, like dog in a brown bag on fire shit. The Devs break more then they can fix, Event offering is a great example of that. 

Don't give me that ""Indie Devs"" bullshit, it's the bullshit you tell yourself to look pass the non stop problems in this game that's been out for 4 years now. 

But you have 1600+ hours, how isn't it a recommend review.. you can't call it bad, you played it that much? 
Well Jane, like's the Dev's talent... my fun has left the building. The bugs are way worst then last year or the year before that. They really need to take a break on the chapters and actually trying to fix the game before trying to offer more DLC in a broken game.

[strike]We'll get DBD2 soon,[/strike] who am I kidding, you need an actually coder and not someone playing with old code adding shit. 

It's ok to be mad at me, I get it.. we all lie to ourselves at one point or another but if you have 50 hours in this game you really shouldn't be the one to talk about how ""great the game is and how someone else's [b]OPINION[/b] is wrong""",1529984548,1703856187,False,6,0,0.528254866600036621,5,True,False,False

The massive pay wall for GAME CHANGING content is horrendous too. It isn't worth it. The community is dying with the developer's ambition and love for the game.

[H1] 2020 Review[/h1]
Dead by Daylight... What a game. There is so much I want to say about this game but I don't know where to start. Dead by daylight is a very enjoyable game, which I believe can be backedup with the amount of hours I have on record (7.1k at the moment of writing this review). However, there is one major thing which brings this game down, and that is most of its community. While the game is very enjoyable at the most, it would improve the overall health of the game if the community came together as one, instead of attacking one another when the boot does not fit.

The community in Dead by Daylight is one of the most toxic playerbases I've ever come across, and this is because the community does not come together as one. Instead it is separated into two groups. You have the survivor groups and the killer groups. Both groups continually fighting against one another, and this has been like this ever since I started playing (in 2016!). Dead by Daylight is all online and it is this factor that contributes to the high toxicity that players see throughout the game. As players play and improve their performance, whether it be killing or surviving, they will begin to ""rank up"". There are 20 ranks between the killers and the survivors. Rank 20 being the starting rank and rank 1 being the finishing rank. When players first begin playing, they WILL see the dark side of the playerbase, however, as they make their way through the ranks down to rank 1, the community generally shows a brighter side.

[i] Please note the key word in that last sentence is [u] generally [/u][/i].

The one thing that makes the community so negative is when one side (killer or survivor) plays in a way that the other does not like. Both sides have their objectives. For the survivors, their [i]main objective[/i] is to escape. This is accomplished by repairing 5 of the 7 generators located around the map which will power 2 exit gates which will allow them to escape. As for the killer, their objective is to stop the survivors from powering the exit gates and prevent them from leaving by hooking them on meat hooks located around the map. While this does not sound too bad, most of the community take it as a life threat and will yell at the killer or at the survivors if they do all they can in their power to achieve their goal. There are many play styles which are looked down upon that create such dramatic events when a player chooses to bid by them. At some point, these ""play styles"" became ""rules"" in which, if a person ""breaks"" one or more of these ""rules"", then they will be abused in the after game chat. 

Survivors have a variety of tools which they can use to keep distance between themselves and the killer. These tools arrange from windows, which everyone can use - including the killers, except the killers cannot climb through as fast as a survivor can - and pallets, which is the survivors' main source of protection when it comes to gaining distance against the killer. While the survivors cannot be prevent from using the windows, their pallets are limited. Survivors can stun a killer for a short time with a pallet from which they can then use as a vault to get away from the killer in chase. However, if a killer decides to break a pallet once it is thrown down, it cannot come back. As a result of this, many survivors will preseve as many pallets as they can by looping them. This is known as [i]Pallet Looping[/i] and is a ""rule"" in which killers say survivors should NOT do as it makes the game a lot harder on the killers. If a killer is in chase, and a suvivor is looping them around a pallet, the other survivors can complete 2-3 generators by the time the killer has caught the looping survivor. This is why killers say survivors should not pallet loop, as pallet looping is a major ""waste"" of the killers' time.

Camping and tunnelling are two ""rules"" in which survivors place against the killers. In Dead by Daylight, camping is when a killer puts a survivor on a meat hook and stays protecting the hook, ensuring the survivor cannot be saved. This is frowned upon from the survivors as survivors believe that every game should be a ""fair"" game. This means that if a survivor is placed on a hook, the killer should not be within 32 metres of that hook unless they are in chase with another survivor. This is because, if a killer is camping a hook, it makes it a lot harder for the survivors to rescue their teammate. While many survivors will continue to repair the generators instead of attemping to save their teammate when being camped, other survivors will stay around the hook, waiting for the killer to leave, and if the killer does not leave the hook and the hooked survivor dies, then the killer has ""breached"" the ""rule"" of ""no camping"" and they will be abused in the after game chat. Tunnelling is when a killer targets one survivor until they die. If a survivor is on the hook and they are rescued and the killer comes back and decides to go for the survivor who just got rescued instead of the survivor who did the rescuing, then the killer will be ""bashed"" in the after game chat, as tunnelling is heavily look down upon.

For the best experience when playing Dead by Daylight, I [b]HIGHLY[/b] recommend closing the chat box. This is because the players DO NOT care if you are playing your first game. If you play in a way that affects another player, they will abuse you in the chat. As I said previously though, only when you are starting out will you see the dark side of the community, as the community is generally a brighter side at the lower ranks.

[h1] Do I Recommend Dead by Daylight?[/h1]
The answer is YES!

After reading all of that, you may be questioning whether or not you should go through and buy Dead by Daylight. My answer to you is yes! Do go through with buying it as the game is amazingly fun! While the community is not the greatest, you can still have loads of fun slashing people, hiding from killers, and most of all, surviving with your friends.

What's better than dying alone? Dying with the people you love!

So let's get it! 

- Purchase Dead by Daylight!
- Pick your side: Are you a Killer or a Survivor?
- Pick your play style - Will you lead your team or are you a sole survivor?
- Pick your character - Will you slaughter them with your chainsaw? Will you surprise them with your invisibility? Or will you chuckle at the sound of your prey's leg snapping in the closing of a bear trap?

Then, a friend and I both got banned over stupid mistakes that shouldn't keep us out of the game. We've tried appealing, but the customer support is bad. It's one thing to have a lot of people playing your game and to have to take your time responding, but it took weeks for them to get back to my appeal only to tell me they were still looking into it. Then, because I had received a family sharing ban (which I was completely unaware of, because despite what the games website will tell you, it did not explain to me if or why I was banned), I was told I couldn't get unbanned unless the person I shared with could get unbanned. I was then told by my friend that his ban was permanent and that they were not going to undo it, so now neither of us can play the game.

Killer used to be challenging,survivor used to be fun. 

They patched this game with patch 4.5 in 2021 to have major changes to movement and visual ""updates"", which was the start of them stripping away its character. 

The lighting in this game went from being iconic, scary, dark, and atmospheric to absolutely horrible, chalky, bright, and as non-immersive as a horror game could be.

If you go back and watch Dead By Daylight content from pre-mid 2021, to now, you can absolutely see exactly what I mean.

This community used to be so diverse and big and even though there was a toxicity, it doesn't even compare to how toxic it is now.
Sure there were moments in game as killer that made me want to slam my keyboard,but now,this game makes you feel nothing.
I feel as though every time I play killer now the survivors give up,and every time I play survivor, I do not even want to continue the game as two of your teammates are usually disconnected or dead from being disgustingly tunneled at 2 generators. 
I cannot sympathize for killers and give into their constant pity party when I played killer during arguably the most survivor sided metas during the game.

You used to face full teams of actual broken perks constantly, larger maps, with a way smaller viable perk pool.
Now I can stop the survivors right in their tracks by blowing up their generators across the map by hooking a survivor,even though I have had no input on what the other players are doing.
The way killer plays now you aren't even encouraged to have fun and chase survivors, just mind-numbingly win the game slowly against opponents that don't even want to be there.

The whole community is broken at this point. If you hear positivity about this game, it is usually someone trying to get you to come watch their stream where they sit there and lie to themselves that they are having a good time while they are panhandling online about a game that died 2 years ago realistically. The player count might be higher, but this community is dead. No one likes this anymore, and if they say they do they are absolutely lying to your face. Unless they are a killer main that sucked at this game before it literally started holding killer's hands like an actual toddler. 

If you don't believe me now, go ahead and waste the time in your life investing your time in this game and community and you will come back to this review and realize that you could've done literally anything else in your life. 

This game will never be back to it's golden days at this point sadly, I've held out hope for too long, but it's done.

I loved this game. At some point, this was a mini cultural staple in gaming. So many people on my friends list have thousands of hours and have basically given it up. So many content creators are jaded on it. So many people arguing online about this game that literally none of them have fun on anymore.

Sometimes the survivors win, and sometimes they don't. There is this thing called Tunneling which means when the killer goes after you right after you got off hook and they haven't hooked someone yet before they went back and killed you. Camping, Camping is when a killer just stands right next to you're hook so no one else will come or when they do, they can get killed. This is only allowed on the first survivor.  Working with survivors. I think this explains itself. Survivors working with the killer. Same thing. T-Bagging, Crouching up and down taunting the killer. This isn't really bad or needs to be reported about, it's just a warning for people who get angry easily. Survivors Disconnecting before they lose. This is less common than the others but is something that needs to be reported. Survivors or Killers hacking. Of course, needs to be reported. IF YOU THINK SOMEONE IS HACKING FIRST CHECK THEIR PERKS AFTER THE GAME TO SEE IF IT WAS A PERK. IF IT WASN'T FELL FREE TO REPORT. I think that is it. How you report people is by waiting til the end of the match and going on their name and moving you're mouse, joystick, or tapping on a thumbs up and down sign then select a report that fit's what you want  to report.

With how bad the map designs are and how fast gens are done, a trash survivor can even do good and make your gameplay as killer stressful.  The only time as a killer when the game is decent when everyone is solo and it feels fair. I don't mean fair as you stomp solos( which sometimes you will) fair as in when you meet solo survivors that is on the same skill level as you and don't have a ton information from discord than the game feels balance. I've legit downed someone less than 10 seconds and generator pops. I'm sick of losing to trash survivors because gens are done too fast and the maps are poorly designed that favors the survivors. It's bullshit. I don't mind losing to people who are better than me but I lose to trash because of these factors, it pisses me off.",1498801318,1703720940,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Game usually has a hard time balancing and it continues to have a hard time Balancing. 

The visuals aren't amazing but the game play is what matters but it might not be fun to some just doing 5 gens running and hiding but if you learn the game then it will be more fun because learning to loop and stay in chase while trying to help your teammates will make you feel good about playing the game. I recommend for newer players to play customs with friends if able to or from experience just play the game you'll learn eventually. 

Playing as killer can be fun at first but when you play enough you will get better survivors but in the games you find easy you start to learn the killer you play and when there are better survivors the more you learn. Playing as survivor pain. But sometimes you must deal and continue on so when playing survivor don't take it too seriously at first the more you have fun and learn the better the experience.

All around Dead By Daylight is a Fine Game if you put in the time to learn and grow a reminder to new players that this games community can be a little opinionated... scratch that really opinionated so learning from survivor or killer mains can be a bit bias so make sure to figure out your own play style and you'll be fine just put in the time and effort but if you don't find it fun then its fine its understandable.",1669355803,1703709346,True,1,0,0.521168172359466553,0,True,False,False

With friends, this game is brilliant, and is a good laugh whilst you all struggle to hit skill checks and loop the killer. However, I find that the solo experience for this game can be lacklustre, often feeling more irritating and annoying then fun. And that's just the survivor side of the game.
Playing as killer is simultaneously rewarding and annoying, with matches either feeling like they were too easy or you never had a chance to begin with. Not to mention the constant struggle between balancing killer perks and survivor perks, with both sides constantly feeling the imbalance that often lingers heavy within matches.
But past all of this, all the complaints, the game has lived and thrived in the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre, and for good reason. It has a dedicated fan-base, a great community and brilliant collaborations with other horror titles. 
Overall, whilst Dead By Daylight is a good game, I'm not sure to what degree I'd recommend it to the average solo player, perhaps keep the game as something to have in mind during large steam sales and pick it up with your friends as you all learn together how to survive the unique mechanics of every killer.",1703699306,1703699306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It doesnt help that the community is also at war with itself constantly, telling each other what the right and wrong way to play is. I've never in my life seen so many people who will bomb your profile because you played against them ""wrong"" in a video game. While its not on the devs to control people's behavior, its on them for never having explicit rules or mechanics for this game. This game weirdly is in the middle of a competitive e-sport and a fun party game. And they never pick which side they want to be on, so the community takes it into their own hands to ""punish"" you for not playing how they want. It's embarrassing.

Overall great game if you pay no attention to meta builds and whiney survivor or killer mains in comment sections or reddit. Play your own game. There's thousands of combinations of perks, add-ons, and synergies at your finger tips. Probably the most fun in solo play is finding the perfect combination of perks from other killers that amplify a different killer's power or play style. 

If you are a solo player, expect to not always escape or kill all 4 survivors every game. It's the nature of it. You will get camped and tunneled out for no reason most of the time, wear that like a badge and move on to the next match. If you get ran around, looped, outplayed, and tag teamed by flashlights just understand those matches are few and far between. There's usually a way you could have played better unless the tileset is extremely unfavorable for your killer. 

If you are playing with friends, this game really shines.. Fun drinking nights, troll builds, griefing the killer with swarm tactics and well coordinated dives.. There's so much to look forward to even at low MMR. 

Speaking of MMR.. Forget worrying about ranks, this used to mean things back on release but now are just signs of monthly playtime. If you're always efficient-- prolonging chases, repairing gens, and rescuing teammates you'll be rank 1 in very few games.

Find what makes it fun for you or you will end up frustrated and put this game down, because it will always be unbalanced maps, unbalanced perks, and unbalanced killers.",1703633386,1703633386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This games is incredible unfriendly to new players. the community is toxic, the devs look at numbers and don't listen to the community. As of this review i've played 1708 hours of this game been around since year 2 of the games lifespan and with the changes that have been made it's only going to get worse.
also microperchases for skins the DLCs cost alot to have them all and if u don't have the DLC ur at a serious handy cap to the majority of players. and there are alot of subtel hackers

Cons
- lots of DLCs to buy or ur disadvantaged
- steep learning curve
- Dev's are out of touch
- gameplay is unbalanced
- microperchases
- subtel hackers
- solo que impossible on survivor
- changes making it worse
- Unbalanced

The game is not new player friendly and I'll stick to this statement because plenty of players have optimised the fun out of the game when it comes to playing it. People not even near the MMR they think they are in playing as if they're in a tournament and the tribalism between both survivor mains and killer mains is WAY TOO TOXIC. Let me try and break it down for you and paint you a picture and I hope this helps in making an informed choice on getting the game. As it stands currently though the game is more survivor sided purely due to the fact that core aspect of the game being hide and seek type of game with barely any info shared between players conflicts with how groups of friends normally play which is over voice chat, which means survivors are actually both under-powered (solo) and overpowered (team play)

Tribalism - Survivor mains 
They're whiny for sure, but statistically this is bound to happen as it's 1 versus 4 but man survivors are pretty delusional. Those that play competitively will kick a person learning to play killer while they are down, they take ANY win as them being good at the game forgetting that an asymmetric game really just depends on RNG and the reactions of every player. Plenty of times there are those people who set arbitrary rules to how killers should be killing properly even if at times those rules put killers in a spot where they practically can't do anything and post game they can be very toxic to even their own teammates. I've had teammates who could not function for 2 minutes after being injured following me for heals when the killer is on their tail AND CAN SEE THEM MY GOD LOOK BEHIND YOU! And then they act like everything they did was perfect and it was just the killer being toxic when the killer was alerted by them all the damn time because they didn't put any effort in surviving like a survivor SHOULD. 

Tribalism - Killer mains 
God competitive killer mains are actually the whiniest babies I've seen and no not the people calling for nerfs to perks or reminding us that the game is survivor sided every minute but there are killer mains who genuinely are mediocre at the game, but want to play competitively, but are not seeing any progress in their gameplay so they stew in the forums and discussion boards complaining about survivors literally doing ANYTHING?? Killers have accused me of genrushing and tryharding when I don't have any items or gen perks on let alone META perks?? Killers constantly whining not even about toxicity (but I'm with them there) but about being STUNNED? do you want the survivors to stand still? I've seen people complain about looping and being blinded like looking at a wall or perks that remedy the stun time don't exist. Complaints from people who clearly do not test or even experiment with their builds because the discussions and forums have become a killer echo chamber. 

Plenty of people playing competitively see the balance of the game in a black and white manner. Survivor bad Killer good, but fail to realise that survivors both hold plenty and no power in that the strength lies in communication, meanwhile the game is set by the killer who when applying pressure well can come out with a clean sweep or close at least. The game is asymmetric too so it will never be fully balanced and people don't want to admit that it's in a much better state than it was years ago. BHVR is slow with balancing but they aren't the worst, but you see streamers overreacted setting off a chain reaction within the playerbase and can just SEE people don't actually think for themselves when they parrot their opinions. Yeah so the game is very competitive now but please don't set out to play it in that manner, even if you're tough or can endure it's FUNNY when you don't take it seriously, break the ice and chat to people, emote, have fun but still try to survive. It's a video game at the end of the day. Not recommending for your sanity, but give it a try if it's on sale, the game is littered with stupid amounts of micro-transactions so the grind for anything good is where most of the play time comes from with some people.",1593587709,1703623503,False,5,0,0.587955653667449951,0,True,False,False

[h1] Short version [/h1]

Don't bother getting into this game. Nothing but frustration and stress await you. The only reason I still play this game is because of friends - Crashes, tons of hackers, and a toxic community make it very hard to have fun with this game right now. Add to that a developer with a thoroughly incompetent balance team who does nothing against scummy or overpowered gameplay tactics, only ever applies bandaid fixes to the massive and widely kown balance issues instead of adressing the problems themselves, and do very little to close the sometimes extreme power gaps between certain killers and you've got yourself a game that'll leave you unsatisfied and frustrated more often than you'll have fun with it. From my experience, a lot of people who still play it regularly only do so because of friends or because they're chasing the high of that one good match in twenty. Its a shame because this game CAN be very fun at times, but the sheer amount of factors that have do be in your favor for that to be the case just make it incredibly inconsistent.
I'd say wait till the balance team gets their stuff together and finally makes the changes required to make this game better, but after playing this game for 5 years I can safely say that will never happen.
So better just keep your hands off of this game altogether.


[h1] Long Version. [/h1]

Let me preface this by saying that when I say ""the developers"", I'm talking strictly about the balance team. The composers, The Texture- and 3D Artists, etc and generally the rest of Behaviour Interactive are doing a great job. Its only the balance team I have a gripe with. With that in mind, lets continue.

[b] [u] Power gaps between killers [/u] [/b]

One of the biggest problems with Dead by Daylight is the sheer difference in power between certain killers. There are killers who are widely considered to be very strong or at times even somewhat overpowered/unfair, while others are so weak that they have a significantly lower win rate on average. This is a problem, because a lot of the changes the devs make to ""balance"" the game are usually general changes, meaning they apply to every killer. So while a survivor nerf may make weaker killers stronger, that also goes for the already strong killers. On the other hand, a survivor buff may mean that the weaker killers suffer even more than they already do. From a balance standpoint, you can see why this might be a problem. Sadly, its a problem the devs do little to nothing about. Meaningfull buffs to weak killers and nerfs to strong killers rarely ever happen, even if the entire community collectively agrees that they are needed. The devs often try to justify this with some questionable statistics, but in the end most of these statistics ignore a huge variety of important factors and often go directly against the experience of the entire community. Yet the devs remain stubborn, insist that they know better, even when its painfully obvious to even the most inexperienced players that they don't.

[b] [u] Solo Queue vs ""Survive with Friends"" [/u] [/b]

The balance problems don't end here though. There's also the difference between Solo Queue (SQ) and ""Survive With Friends"" (SWF). (For those of you who don't play the game, SQ is when you play alone with random people, SWF is when you play together with people from your fried list.) SWF is widely considered to be much stronger than SQ because it is possible to properly communicate with and coordinate between one another via Discord or TS, and you can pick reliably good players to play with. With Solo Queue, this isn't possible. You're at the mercy of your teammates who often make very questionable decisions, your communication is limited to only 2 emotes and (thanks to the horrible matchmaking) you'll often get matched with teammates far below your or the killer's skill level. As you can guess, this can make for some very frustrating matches and is the reason why SQ is usually considered the weakest role in the game. Its also a problem because similar to killers, every survivor nerf that makes SWF weaker also affects SQ, and vice versa. The community has made a plethora of suggestions to change this (mainly more ways to communicate) and bring SQ and SFW closer together, but the devs once again continue to ignore them. This an ongoing trend as you'll soon realize.

[b] [u] Horrible Map Design [/u] [/b]

There's also the problem of the map design. What I mean by that isn't that the maps don't look pretty, but that they're horrible from a gameplay standpoint. Certain randomly generated map tiles (often referred to as ""loops"") are stronger than others. Some are so strong that the killer will have a very hard time catching a good survivor there, others are so weak that they're nothing but a mild annoyance to the killer. The problem is that the maps are randomly generated, and very often you'll find multiple very strong tiles strung together in one part of the map while another sometimes lacks any tiles at all. As you can probably guess, this makes for some very frustrating moments as you're basically at RNGesus's mercy. As a killer you're often forced to leave survivors in one part of the map because you have no chance of catching them without throwing the game, and as a survivor you'll often find yourself in so called deadzones where you can't do anything. There's also maps with an objectively horrible layout from a gameplay standpoint, some of which are either extremely confusing to traverse or can offer massive advantages/disadvantages to one side. Your performance as a killer is often linked directly to the map you get.

[b] [u] Scummy Tactics [/u] [/b]

Then there's the scummy tactics. There's a whole onslaught of scummy or overpowered tactics players of both sides can use to turn a match into living hell for the opponent, some of which can completely suck any fun out of a match for one side entirely. These tactics are known to the devs and some of them have been around since the launch of the game back in 2016. Yet the vast majority of them still lack any real base-game counters, and the only way to have a reliable chance against them is by bringing certain perks. 

[b] [u] The neverending Bandaid Fixes [/u] [/b]

This brings me to my next point: The Bandaid Fixes. What do I mean by that? The developers rarely ever adress the problems themselves and instead release perks that are counters to that very specific problem. The thing is, there's only four perks slots, but countless situations that require specific perks.
Let me visualize this for you.
Imagine you've got a hole in the wall of your apartment and the developers are your landlord. Naturally, you tell them about the problem. Now what the developers of this game do is instead of stuffing the hole, they put a painting over it. That in and of itself is already questionable, but fine. Better than nothing, right? Now imagine you have 15 holes in your apartment, but the landlord only gives you 4 paintings and tells you to deal with it. Then you've got yourself Dead by Daylight. Except said paintings are usually locked behind paywalls. No, I'm not kidding. This has become a big problem, and the devs have been continually ignoring said problem since the launch of the game 6 years ago. 

[b] [u] Conclusion [/u] [/b]

I could go on like this for a while, talk about the ever-increasing amount of hackers and game crashes, or the horrible grind, but I'm running out of characters so I'll keep it brief. Dead by Daylight is a horrible unbalanced mess that I wouldn't recommend anyone getting into anymore. It can be fun under the right circumstances, but more often than not it'll leave you frustrated and unsatisfied.

Like most games that attract profit, DbD also attracted the wrong kind of attention. Namely hacking and cheating. 

In 2019 the game transitioned into a part P2P - part Server online model, with the dedicated servers having virtually no cybersecurity checks and only Hosting the match.

Since then the company had their developer build leaked to the public, implemented MMR and tried to promote the game as an ""esport"", and past 2020 and through the pandemic the cheating instances went through the roof. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current situation as of the time of this report (Winter 2023):

1) By intentional decision of the company, the game has released with crossplay on certain platforms, which
led to thousands of accounts being created by bots and distributed by hackers to players that want to keep cheating.


2) A whitelist queue has been implemented in the backend ONLY for -affiliated content creators-, to lessen the chances of running into cheaters when streaming (by not matching with smurfs/pre-banned players).

At the same time, several streamers are making content with ""comp players"", who are little more than the front-face of the cheater community of the game.


3) Multiple groups and sites of hackers have surfaced that distribute cheats in the open. 

Cheaters using speedhacks / lagswitch-teleporting / generator speed hacks (even with no related perks or items) are everywhere. ""Subtle"" ones try to hide it behind objects/walls and out of line of sight, others do it blatantly.


4) Since Fall 2023, players and streamers have again been getting queue sniped and targeted.

Additionally, several cheaters stream themselves openly showcasing and distributing such software, in certain streaming sites that refuse to ban them.


5) Finally, the company openly refuses to implement a replay system for reports, requiring players instead to run recording software at all times and file reports with video evidence directly to the company's site via a convoluted process.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion: DbD is a game plagued by recurring cheater waves, with the company behind it claiming ""they are racing against hackers to block cheats as soon as they can"" (they are not, or are unable to keep up).

Unless BHVR either implements a robust anti-cheat, or switches into a full server-hosted game model, DO NOT INVEST IN THIS GAME. Neither licenses nor gameplay are worth dealing with cheaters in 2 out of 3 lobbies.

Yes, it is that prevalent, especially in heavily affected servers like EU, LATAM, SE Asia, and recently with increasing frequency in US East.

Surprisingly enough, playing survivor in no full squad is not a pain anymore. You can see on the UI what your teammates are doing and when a player leaves, bot takes their place. And to everyone's surprise, the bot is actually decent.

On the killer side the game is kinda the same. Some killers are still OP, some really bad, but you can't really judge BHVR for this.

Matchmaking in this really is really weird honestly, back then it was easy to say if you play in good or bad lobby based on rank, but that was removed and hidden MMR took it's place. It is sad that playing the game and getting your desired rank doesn't feel so rewarding now, because it doesn't matter anymore, all you get from it are extra Bloodpoints.

Even with the disappointing matchmaking change, I feel like BHVR did a good job at improving player's experience by balancing a lot of things that needed to be adjusted and giving solo survivors QoL changes.

As a result, every new update has been a direct downgrade in terms of both aesthetic and general game-play. No one seems to know how to fix this and honestly at this point, I don't believe a fix is actually possible. Also the developers are so fragile it's offensive.

When DbD was released, it was a very dark game; not just thematically, but visually as well. The darkness of the game along with the originally very narrow field of view of its three killers contributed heavily to a stealth-based meta. This style of game-play, along with the dark atmosphere, was much more intense and thematically in line with the game's horror aesthetic. Today, however, we can see that the game has devolved into a brightly-lit , goofy, ""run in circles"" simulator where perks as well as a substantially larger quantity of pallets have been added in order to enforce competitiveness at the cost of theme and atmosphere. Hiding is still possible, of course, but with the enormous FoV that killers currently have, along with the fact that most maps take place in brightly lit environments, stealth has taken a back-seat to looping in terms of usefulness; the game's horror aesthetic suffers immensely for this. 

Endurance and the perks which enable it have additionally created and enforced the idea that getting hit by a killer is often not a big deal, further removing the game from its horror roots.

The addition of 'survive with friends' wasn't inherently bad. Many people had requested the feature and it was honestly cool that the developers listened to the players. However, as the game was not initially built for SWF, many of the perks had to be re-balanced in order compensate for the occasional usage of voice communications; this re-balance has still not reached a point resembling satisfactory. Combined with skill-based-matchmaking, SWF makes it inevitable that you will reach a point, especially as killer, where the game simply is not fun. The primary game-play loop, similarly to the game's perks, was not designed to be engaged with VC and to this day, four players with voice communications have an immense leg up on every killer solely by utilizing these two functions in conjunction. This issue unfortunately combines with the former two and compounds the issue of Dead by Daylight's loss of identity.

As the game has continued and new characters have been added, a number have found it harder to fit in to the cast when compared to others. Trickster, Skull Merchant, and the Singularity, for example, are far from the typical person would describe as ""horror.""

Finally [spoiler] I hope, [/spoiler] the addition of charms is cute. Cute is not scary. A fair quantity of character skins fall into this category as well and I'm wondering at this point if the developers have simply given up on the idea of this being a horror game.

Dead by Daylight has been on this downward slope for a long time and, unfortunately, the largest amount of damage was done so early-on that a reversion to the original ""meta"" for lack of a better term would essentially require the creation of an entirely new game in addition to the deletion of the current one; obviously this will not happen. Though, never in my life would I have imagined the spooky game where psycho killers and ghosts hunt you in an old abandoned junk yard would turn into 'spinning in circles while a waifu-bait k-pop star machine-guns knives at you on a fluorescent space planet in the middle of space daytime.'

...I guess ""press [F] to pay respects."" The game is still fun sometimes but even with [spoiler] and oftentimes because of [/spoiler] these mountains of added content, DbD is a frustrating and hollowed-out shadow of its former self.

The moderators appointed to manage the discussion forums also actively treat people like they're 5 years old. I was banned for a month after calling someone a ""turd.""

Lots of survivors and killers to play as, the licensed characters are amazing to see all in 1 game. Even now years later and they're still working on the game and adding onto it, fixing issues and balancing constantly. It can be niche but I'd say give it a go. Specially if you get 3 more friends to play so you can all be vs a random killer player. Or if you have enough to fill a 5 man game, You can play private matches and take turns playing killers. It's even more fun in private matches since they were kind enough to unlock the best version of every perk and item in the game for you to use in private games so you can even test builds out and just enjoy annoying you friends.

Killers have the ability to stack perks that give them unfair advantage, to start. Like blocking our only defenses like pallets, and windows to escape. They even block hex totems and gates. They can stack aura reading abilities and speed boosts. Also, hex totems. Some killers have ranged weapons along with the ability to catch up to survivors if they fail with their attack. Some perks or offerings are really unfair. Like having a mori that can kill you without being injured or hooked at all. Hooks are so close together that some of the perks or offerings to help eliminate hooks don't have any effect. You still won't get close to struggling out of their grasp. There are so many flaws with this game, but it doesn't matter because the developers only focus on cash grabbing on DLC for mainly killers and stupid things like banners and icons. This game has gotten ridiculous and I'm wondering why I even continue to play. I've noticed others have felt the same way because lobbies are having longer wait times because no one wants to play survivor. I wish there were changes to make this game feel even. Especially on smaller maps. 

Side note: Some of the level designs are clearly underdeveloped. Having gates on one side or extremely close to each other. Gens being clumped together and sometimes all on one side of the map. Also, minimal pallets on some maps. Glitches on seeing your progress on self healing. Problems with skill checks in general. But mostly when you are on a generator. Whether you're getting on one or off one, it will set off a missed skill check.",1703372817,1703372817,False,5,2,0.545712292194366455,0,True,False,False
