With that said the game does have a problem.
It's unstable if you don't find ways to fix the game it might crash on you often or worse not work at all.

Now onto the positives.
This game offers you :
Meaningful choices
Enjoyable aesthethic
Variety of weapons AND ammo types.
Charming companions
Morally grey factions to help at your choosing.
GOOD DLC's
A unique story and background lore for its locations
Customizable character
A portable ingame radio that you can turn off.
Mods.
Easter eggs to hunt.

The negatives :
The gameplay is a bit janky and the game can be very unstable but that can easily be fixed by reading the discussion threads and mods.",1606081913,1708909333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All tails in the air.
But the penny landed with its head dancing.

A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform,
Standing with your head held high,
Hot down to the floor.
But it couldn’t be you.
It couldn’t be you.
It’s a picture of Hitler.

He go “Do-do-do-do-do”
He go “Do-do-do-do-do”
He go “Do-do-do-do-do–
Do you want to dance?”

Well, I couldn’t see what was to be,
So I just stood there laughing.

A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform,
Standing with your head held high,
Hot down to the floor.
But it couldn’t be you.
It couldn’t be you.
It’s a picture of Hitler.

He go “Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh”
He go “Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh”
He go “Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh–
“Heads we’re dancing.”

Yknow, Kate Bush is a genius but what an odd song, eh? Hitler wasn't even that type of charming. Then again, people still fall for Caesar, both in game and IRL, and the dude is a moron with a shit understanding of dialectics so there you go.

Main menu song is my favorite with the battle song when engaging enemies a close 2nd. Ill admit a lot of the enemies are brain dead and cheeseable.

Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher

There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all living the devil may care
And I'm just a devil with love to spare
So Viva New Vegas
Viva New Vegas

How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if there were 40 more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away

Oh, there's blackjack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva New Vegas
Viva New Vegas

Viva New Vegas with you neon flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva New Vegas, turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again

I'm gonna keep on the run, I'm gonna have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke, oh well, I'll always remember
That I had a swinging time

I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot

I haven't had a single crash in 6 hours of gameplay, since I patched and modded my game. It took me a while to get into this, the game starts slow and was riddled with bugs and crashes. Once I made it past that point I'm having an absolute blast, the world doesn't feel so small anymore and getting a dozen levels under my belt really improves the experience. A remaster of this game would be unreal, with updated textures, draw distance etc etc.

So, I'm leaving my initial review up for now, even though I solved the crashing problem with the community guide. It took installing multiple mods, signing up for websites, updating my windows libraries. A huge fckn pain in the a$$. This game needs a developer patch instead of relying on the community to fix the garbage. So far the story is good and the game play is what I would expect. At this point I wouldn't recommend it, go play something else. Fallout 4 is my favorite game of all time, which is why I'm giving this stupid game more effort than it deserves.

This game WILL NOT STOP CRASHING. It's so annoying having to replay 10 minutes of gaming OVER AND OVER again. I have three separate machines and it crashes on ALL OF THEM. One is a 13900k + 4090. I even have the resolution turned down to try to help. NOPE. No matter what I do, it randomly crashes while playing, any new interaction with a character is almost a guaranteed crash.

Style/Setting
Shot and dumped in a shallow grave before being saved by a robot cowboy, this is truly the wild west of the future. From the intro to the credits, style and charm oozes like a dapperly dressed ghoul on his last poker chip.
 
Music
Besides your handy big iron, the radio is your best friend. Awaken your inner cowboy as you stroll into town with what tunes ye’ fancy, you’ll be playing the OST for years to come.

Map Design
But when it comes to retrospection, what I respect the most about NV is in its game design. Handholding is a huge crutch of modern gaming, but NV leaves it to you all from the start. Find your own leads, or hell, just go fuck off somewhere else. There is a general intended path, but it funnels you toward the main attractions of the world perfectly without you ever realizing you’re being guided. 

Interactive World
And everywhere you go, you’ll leave traces of your growing legend. Help stop the town bandits stashed at the abandoned casino? Few days later, and you'll be hearing about your deeds on the radio. Depending on how you resolve quests, you’ll even hear different things from people around the game, reacting to your decisions. It enforces roleplaying, as your decisions actually mean something. 

Replayability
And oh, the decisions you can make. For most RPGs, I can only handle one playthrough. Even Skyrim was maybe 3 characters. New Vegas? Honestly don’t know. I played through all factions at least once, then maybe another 6 characters of various progressions since back then. Only game I’ve ever played with truly good “evil playthrough” options

Character Builds
Damn, you telling me you beat the game 4 times and still keep coming back? Hell yeah man, there’s over a dozen weapon types, from plasma to pistol to punch to puncture to projectile explosives… Or of course, you can beat the game as a Pacifist if you boost your noncombat skills, just ask Jake. Smooth talk your way to victory in actually satisfying battles of wit. Remember when games had good writing?

DLC
Need more game still? How about going to Zion National Park? Or a Survival Horror Casino? What’s that? You want there to be an overarching narrative behind the DLCs that leads to a dramatic final showdown? You got it boss, here, have a hundred different weapon mods too

Modding 
Someone say mods? You want MORE game?!.. Okay! The community is still pumping new content out all the time. Sure, new enemies, new weapons, new coat of paint to make it all pretty. But also many questlines, entire fan-made DLCs, some entirely new games (New California/The Frontier) It’s not all professional, but what comes in spades is passion, and I’m often very pleasantly surprised. 

Memorable Cast
Mr House.  Caesar. Yes Man. Benny. FUCKIN Easy Pete. Too many characters have beat the test of time, memes all the years later. But besides the actual characters, the writing and dialogue are just always razor sharp in tone and/or humor 

Nostalgia
I played it at the apex of my rpg marathon after getting an xbox, so it definitely formed many of my tastes. Retro dystopias like Bioshock will continue to be a favorite of mine. That’s it. Just recognizing rose-colored bias. I’ll always be hooked on you, New Vegas. (Add +100 hr played on Xbox)

Although there are some welcome quality-of-life improvements, the core experience remains the same, which is fine, as it is very entertaining. 

The guns feel nice to use, with the new iron sights mechanic an essential upgrade. I adore the overall sci-fi Western aesthetic and music, too. However, I cannot help but feel like the map is largely empty and lacking the necessary polish to make exploring it a pleasure.

There are a few more such instances in the game which make it clear what kind of pressure the developers of New Vegas were working under, especially the time constraints. Hence, many side quests are simple, yet very irritating fetch quests. This is rendered even more frustrating by the fact that the locations in the game all feel too spacious, and not compact enough. Navigating them takes ages.

Overall, I quite enjoyed the DLC, as well. To conclude, New Vegas could've been better, had the developers been given more time to truly flesh their ideas out. Either way, the final game thus feels just good enough to call it ""great"", yet blatantly unfinished and lacking polish.

I played this on console a long time ago and loved it. I decided to try it out on PC only to see that it's pretty much unplayable on the platform. I heard the PC version wasn't great, but I didn't know it was THIS bad. Even after trying some mods that were supposed to help with stability and crashes, I was still getting crashes every 5-10 minutes. From what I've seen, this has been a known issue since launch and for some reason they never fixed the game. About 80 minutes into the save, I just gave up because I was sick of having to reload the game and redo certain sections constantly. I looked up more potential methods to help with stability using mods, file editing and config changes, and ultimately decided not to even bother with it anymore as I shouldn't have to do a ton of workarounds just to make the game functional. That's a bunch of time to look up and mess around with stuff when I could be spending that time playing a game that actually works.

I have a very high end system, yet the game remains unplayable because of how poorly it works on here. If you want to play this game, just play it on console.

The atmosphere, the rpg elements, the loot system, the characters and the story makes for a very immersive experience.

If you're fine with just spending like 2 hours of your time just to install essential mods that makes the game play out smoother and more stable, then you won't be disappointed with this purchase as it can bring you thousands of play time instead. I might havve 14 hours, but trust me, I haven't even gotten to the best part of the story yet. In fact, I'm prob only 15% of the way to finish the game. Which really just shows how big the scale of the open world is. 

It's not bloated with fetch quests too, every interaction you have with the characters and your surroundings is so well written that it really makes you think on what to do and also gives you multiple choices to solve conflicts or issues.

Nobody talks about fallout 3, 4 or 76 in a positive light. Every time it is brought up in discussion there are a myriad of problems apparent to everyone. Nobody is under the illusion that this is acceptable or worth of any cultural value.

This game was an accident, a flash in the pan, it will never be created again and you should play it because of that fact. There is no game like this and a game like this will never come again.

Thought i'd update this review as honestly its been 14 years since new vegas came out and I am yet to find a game that matched it in terms of choices and fun.

New Vegas is a great game, it may require some tweaks and stuff to make it run on a modern PC but it is 100% worth it. Kill anyone, go anywhere, side with factions or kill them all and still complete the game.

In the vast realm of gaming, there are titles that transcend time, leaving an indelible mark on those who dare to venture into their worlds. Among these, one stands out as a beacon of immersive storytelling, unparalleled freedom, and enduring allure: Fallout: New Vegas. As I embark on a journey to revisit this beloved masterpiece, I am compelled to share the profound impact it has had on my gaming journey and why, even after 14 years, it remains a pinnacle of the RPG genre.

[h2] Unveiling the Mojave Wasteland [/h2]

Stepping into the Mojave Desert is akin to stepping into a parallel universe, teeming with life amidst the desolation. With each stride, you traverse highways, delve into caves, and encounter settlements, each brimming with stories waiting to be unearthed. The attention to detail is nothing short of breathtaking, weaving a tapestry of realism that draws you deeper into its enigmatic embrace. From the first moments of uncertainty to the final revelations, every step in the Mojave feels like a revelation, an exploration of the human condition amidst the ruins of civilization. What sets Fallout: New Vegas apart is its unwavering commitment to player agency: 

[i] You are not merely a bystander in this world; you are the architect of your destiny. [/i]

Whether you choose the path of a benevolent savior or a ruthless opportunist, the Mojave bends to your will, offering countless avenues to carve out your legacy. The freedom to define your character's identity, motivations, and moral compass is a testament to the game's unparalleled depth and replayability.

In the crucible of conflict, your arsenal is your most steadfast companion. Fallout: New Vegas boasts a veritable treasure trove of weaponry, each as diverse as the roles you inhabit. From conventional firearms to outlandish contraptions imbued with fire and fury, there is a tool for every task and a strategy for every encounter. The seamless integration of weapon variety enhances gameplay, ensuring that each engagement is as exhilarating as it is strategic.

In the Mojave, every action carries weight, every choice a ripple in the fabric of fate. The beauty of Fallout: New Vegas lies in its commitment to consequence, where decisions echo across the wasteland, shaping the world and its denizens in unforeseen ways. From the desolate ruins of Camp Searchlight to the bustling streets of New Vegas, each locale is a testament to the power of choice and the enduring legacy of one's deeds.

As the sands of time continue to shift, Fallout: New Vegas stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the boundless creativity of its creators. Despite the passage of 14 years, its magic remains undiminished, beckoning newcomers and veterans alike to embark on a journey unlike any other.

There are 4 main endings you can choose from, and each side quest has at least 2 endings that are either reflected in the world or during the ending slides that tell you the consequences of your actions.

There is also a very active community of mod creators constantly releasing new and interesting content for the game, allowing you to play this for a long time. I've been playing it on and off for a decade.



The game has performance issues due to the game's engine and the developer's lack experience with the Gamebyro Engine and the GECK. You can fix the issues with mods.

It's the best Bethesda Fallout of all time. But ONLY because of its ridiculous modability. ;)
And as of Obsidian's story telling. ^^

Unfortunately, they fucked up in an update,
https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Fallout_NV_Mod_Conflict_Troubleshooting#Issue_-_Regional_-_non-English_version_has_different_FormIDs
which makes translating mods a bit of a pain in the butt.

But if you are not afraid of playing the english version, this game will entertain you a lot and infinitely as of modding.

I wrote some stuff myself and did German translation from scratch on behalf of another person's work who allowed me to do so.
Aside of that, I am focusing on a house mod in Goodsprings, which I played since my mentor AltDunmer worked on it.
V3.0 of my own will be up soon:

It's an incredible rpg that was a victim of circumstance. It is the second Obsidian rpg that was subject rushed development and a story that was too big for its own good, the first being Kotor 2. The game has an incredible story but everything between talking to different characters is alright at best. I understand why people might drop the game because of that, or because it's too unstable without mods, or with too many mods. 

It is also harder to look back on New Vegas because of the allegations against Chris Avellone, one of the lead writers for the game.

1. Run the game in windows 7 compatibility mode.
2. Turn off Data Execution Prevention (DEP) for the FalloutNV.exe file. This can be done by going to System->About->Advanced->Performance->DEP.
3.Install the 4GB ram patch for the game. The game is 32bit, therefore only uses 2GB ram.
4.Install LOOT. This will help with mod load orders.
4.Install the following mods, preferably using vortex for ease of use:
         -Yukichigai Unofficial Patch 
         -New Vegas Anti Crash 
         -Johnny guitar NVSE 
         -Stewie Tweaks and Engine Fixes 
         -New Vegas Script extender 
         -JIP LN NVSE 
5.Launch the game directly from Vortex. This is in the top left hand corner, indicated by an arrow.
(OPTIONAL). look up guides online for how to do anything here. the mods are found on NEXUS, and make sure everything is compatible before hand.

Probably one of the best western RPG's in the decades. Buggy as heck cause they only had 18 months to work on it, but since 2011/12 I've played it without hitches or constant crashing; except for very, very rare occasions.
The fanbase for this game is a bit- how shall I say it... Political and Reddit-like. Look I love New Vegas, but if it weren't for Fallout 3 the franchise would've been dead with Brotherhood of Steel.
Would say give all factions a try, but personally I've now been unable to tolerate NCR's crap like I did as a kid cause as a 24 year old (at the time of writing this), the shit we're dealing with in reality pretty much is front-and-centre with the NCR's storyline/lore...
I would suggest buying this game in the event Bethesda sucked Microsoft's dick enough to suppress/hide it to improve Bethesda's sales for their RPG titles, like to what happened with Rockstar and the og 3D GTA games. Extreme case yes, but gotta end the review with a funny; just buy the damn game and have a blast!

P.S the reason it's not 10/10; needs a remastered version on the latest engine, and providing full development time, problem is that most of the talented folks who made this game are probably not even part of Obsidian anymore...",1374235781,1707343844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE, install unofficial patches first BEFORE ANYTHING. EVEN IF YOU WANT THE VANILLA EXPERIENCE. Trust me, the game did an ""infinite loading screen"" on my computer just now and I'm lucky for having a bug so soon. (I literally only clicked the download button in my Steam library, as vanilla as it could get)

I also found out that, for modding, you will need to start a new save, meaning ALL YOUR PREVIOUS VANILLA SAVES ARE PRETTY UNSTABLE. (source: a top google search result )

So if you're like me who got this game recently, GET SOME TRUSTED PATCHES FIRST. Or cry over gone saves.

(unless you're lazy or you want the ""🅱utt-hurting 🅱anilla"" experience like a hipster who sits in a Starbucks 5am to 11pm with a whipped-cream-topped water™)

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
One and 19 more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip
21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip

The game has many noticeable plot holes, such as you being shot for stealing a tin can by the NCR after you killed Caesar and solved all of their problems they accept outside help with. The game is better than all other action rpgs in that you don't have to kill anyone, but the game lacks replayability due to it's side quests.

still just as fun.
only the loading screens are like a million times shorter than what i remember them being lol.

open a door?
crash!
walk along the road?
crash!
try to fast travel literally anywhere?
crash!
fuck this buggy piece of shit i'd get a refund if i could.

after leaving it uninstalled for awhile i tried making a new game and it's going fine. guess i'll have to wait and see if it starts crashing lots for no reason again. i remember the crashes started happening after going to big mountain and getting lobotomized by the weird scientist robots, so probably just gonna avoid going there forever.
i got to about level 19 i think then it started the whole ""close itself down for no reason"" thing. first it was just like once an hour, no biggy.

Thats how you already know its good by default. Thank you, Obsidian. :pray:
Literally took only 18 months to create a beautiful, massive living world and experience while massive AAA games like Cyberpunk or Starfield shit the bed trying to even run, let alone start up.

Facts aside, New Vegas is what Fallout was supposed to be. Although the game itself is quite dated and can be archaic at first, if you are able to look past it, the game itself is - what I would say - one of (if not THE) best shooter RPG games on the market. Skills actually have an effect on gameplay, and can change the story completely. Not to mention guns themselves actually have depth to them, unlike probably 90% of other shooters.

With a truckload of quests, branching paths, intriguing characters, fun (though downright dated) combat, fascinating set pieces, versatile perks, and clever environmental storytelling that will keep you preoccupied and returning for more, you'll need a Fixer for how addictive this damn game is. Plus the DLC is a must-play - Dead Money being the best - no matter what naysayers might have you believe.

In its current state in 2024 with what I would assume are major compatibility issues I would no longer suggest playing it. I have spent more time dealing with game breaking bugs and researching than I have playing the game in an attempt to play it unmodded. I loved this on the 360 and really wanted to at least finish one play through on the PC seems like that is not going to be possible. Won't even create a new game after uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times. File verification every single time you play....if you need to play it would strongly suggest following this guy's video on bug fixes and mod management it fixes the issues I faced in 2024.

Not only this but the choices you are confronted with are complex and not binary as opposed to how Bethesda RPGs feel most of the time. Being made in 18 months, even though that was the plan all along and you can't completely blame Bethesda, it stands as a marvel of how alive, unique and well written a game world can be. It is a world that you adapt to as you play, feeling more experienced as you delve deeper into the characters, lore and game mechanics. The ability to use this knowledge but also still have new experiences and fun moments creates an environment where you not only find yourself looking forward to loading a new game, but are actively thinking of the next two playthoughs you're going to do once you finish your current one. Not to mention the tutorial and Ghost Town Gunfight are the perfect introduction for new players and old. Yes, the game is unstable, being made in a short development time with talk from lead developers saying they probably should have spent more time on the bugs and less on ""shinny objects"". However, modding the game is really not that hard once you get a basic understanding and from there, you'll play it the way it was intended and then some. The community is so active and there are so many new and well developed mods, it really adds a ton more content and enjoyment. I know there was an uproar about the 84/100 on metacritic, but aside from the bugs a lot of the same dna is still in the game so personally I wouldn't look at the number and listen the fans.

[h2]TLDR:[/h2]
[b] Unfortunately, the character limit on Steam forced me to shorten this review.[/b] 
FNV stands on an unstable foundation, its flaws veiled by the smoke of its positive aspects. Despite the widespread acclaim, many players turn a blind eye to the glaring issues at its core. While I genuinely enjoy the game, it's crucial to address its serious flaws.

[h3]Summery:[/h3]
•Extremely buggy without mods; though with mods, bugs persist, to a lesser extent.
•Many CTDs, even with mods.
•Rushed development with many cut content, particularly The Legion.
•Absence of post-game content.
•Limited use of reputation and karma systems.
•Limited choices of stat, perk, and, skill checks in dialogue.
•Instances of NPCs unrealistically trusting the player.
•The game forces you to kill Benny, or have him disappear.
•Sparse non-lethal options and pacifist roleplaying.
•Some factions have no ending slides depending on who you side with.
•The Fiends are always hostile; no way to ally or join them.
•Majority of quest outcomes follow a linear path, diminishing any player impact.
•Limited character appearance and gameplay customisation.
•Limited companion customisation.
•Poor implementation of character traits.
•Clunky gunplay, melee, and overall combat mechanics.
•The Pipboy interrupts the pace of combat.
•Special stats are unbalanced.
•UI is awful.
•You can't have multiple quest markers.
•Slow movement speed with no sprinting option.
•Odd and inconsistent movement, leading to random sliding.
•DLC pop-up spam during the beginning.
•Lack of distance indicators for places of interest on the compass mini-map.
•Invisible walls.
•The hotkey for changing ammo is ""2"" with no way to change it.
•No FOV slider.
•Lack of mouse acceleration option in in-game settings.
•Certain graphics settings locked behind the launcher and inaccessible in-game.
•No random events or encounters.
•Repetitive and frequently reused large empty interiors and environments.
•Repeated use of the same voice actors for different named NPCs.
•Talking to NPCs pauses the world.
•Story and characters have plot holes.
•DLC doesn’t effect the main storyline.
•Lack of animations during dialogues, often resulting in the ""Bethesda stare"".
•Underutilised crafting and survival mechanics.
•Underwhelming water exploration.
•Hit Detection is awful; hitting invisible walls is common.
•Most unique weapons being mere reskins with better stats.
•Underutilisation of weapon modifications, which are irremovable once applied.
•Loading screens dividing sections of The Strip and Freeside.
•Bad QoL such as having to rebind your weapons.
•Vats will target companions.
•Minor side factions have little impact on main quest.
•The Wild Wasteland trait was underutilized.

[h3]In Depth:[/h3]
As you advance in the main quest, you'll obtain pardons from both the NCR and the Legion, resulting in a reset of your faction reputation with them. This is totally contrived, illogical, and strains one's suspension of disbelief. Prior to the pardon, players can freely engage in widespread slaughter of NCR and Legion members. Seriously? The notion of being absolved of such significant crimes is a glaring example of the game's tendency towards protagonist worship. It communicates the message that as the player, you are exempt from the rules, undermining the worldbuilding.

Following the pardon, you can interact with Caesar or Ambassador Crocker. Both inexplicably place trust in you, regardless of any prior faction massacres that you may of committed. This unwarranted trust is a severe undermining of their characters. Both characters assign you quests, blindly relying on you, despite having no good reason for trusting you. Caesar tasks you with using the platinum chip to destroy the Securitron vault beneath the Legion's fort, while House wants you to activate the vault for his control. Regardless of your choice, Caesar unquestioningly accepts your account, never bothering to verify the outcome beneath the fort. This oversight becomes even more stupid if you had previously slain numerous Legion members before the pardon. This inconsistency detracts from an otherwise well-crafted character.

Mr. House, written as a super genius, paradoxically possesses one of the most stupid security oversights. His chamber door is secured merely by an unlocked terminal, guarded by a few Securitrons, with a convenient elevator to his chamber. In 261 years, one would expect House to have sealed off this vulnerability or at least added a password to the terminal. The existence of such a blatant plot hole is disappointing and is inconsistent with the character's intelligence. 

A more plausible approach could involve an investigative process to locate House's chamber, possibly with faction assistance. Rather than a unlocked terminal, the story could demand you to uncover the hidden location and, with the aid of a faction or alternative means, devise a plan to breach in to it. This would offer a more logical and engaging method to confront Mr. House, rather than the improbable reliance on an unprotected terminal leading directly to his most secure domain. Additionally, it would be reasonable to expect higher security around such a critical area,

The game compels you to kill Benny; there's no way to save him. Even if you untie him, he's highly likely to be killed by Legion soldiers. If he miraculously survives, he can escape through a gate and vanishes from the game, essentially mirroring his demise. Additionally, the oversight of leaving Benny armed while being held as a prisoner near Caesar raises questions about the Legion's security logic, especially considering that upon arriving at the fort, the player's weapons are confiscated while Benny retains his.

If you become vilified by the Legion, you can still fast travel to the Fort, mysteriously bypassing the Colorado River. Factions possess a seemingly magical ability to detect if you've committed hostile acts against them. For instance, if you kill a member non-stealthy, you'll receive a reputation penalty, even in the absence of any witnesses. This also extends to the Karma system as well, which feels like a tacked on feature without significantly contributing to the overall experience. 

Certain quests in the game offer linear outcomes with a illusion of choice. For example, the Goodsprings mission where Joe Cobb requests the player to kill a merchant who escaped his gang. The player is presented with a binary decision: siding either with the gang or the townsfolk. The lack of additional and peaceful resolutions in this feels out of place for a ""roleplaying"" game. One might expect multiple options for resolving this complex conflict, but the player is confined to only two outcomes, despite the potential for additional options.

Character and companion customisation options are quite restricted. Background and backstory choices are absent, and the age slider has no discernible impact, rendering the character's age pointless. Appearance options are limited, resulting in minimal reactions from NPCs. The character traits, though a promising concept, fall short, allowing only two selections out of a total of 10 (15 with DLC). Unfortunately, these traits are imbalanced, with certain ones clearly superior. A more robust trait system akin to CK2, where age holds significance, would of been better. Character builds tend to lack diversity, often devolving into the same repetitive mono-builds, akin to the Skyrim stealth archer. Melee combat feels monotonous, involving constant left mouse button mashing.

Special stats significance are relatively diminished as maximum skills corresponding to these stats can still be achieved. Notably, a character can reach 100 Speech with only 1 Charisma, rendering Charisma irrelevant. Endurance stands out as the most best stat, overshadowing others. Agility doesn't impact movement speed, and Perception can be overshadowed by the presence of ED-E.",1706887879,1706887943,False,7,0,0.517211019992828369,0,True,False,False

As someone who pre-ordered the special edition back on the 360 and still has that copy, and who got every achievement, I can say that this is a fun game. But unlike what seems to be the popular opinion New Vegas was my least favorite one between it's prequel and sequel. 3 > 4 > NV is my ranking (haven't tried 76). At this point it's been long enough since I actually played 3 and NV that I can't recall the minute differences in mechanics that may have led to that preference... but what I definitely remember is that the setting of NV just didn't match my own vibe. Too much desert and I'm not at all interested in the casino/Vegas theme. Once I was inside some other location I had fun, but the overworld exploration felt like a bit of a chore.

All that said... I don't think it was worth what I paid for the special edition pre-order, but for the price it goes for these days on Steam it's definitely worth picking up if you like these Bethesda style games (I know Obsidian made this one... might be part of why I don't like it as much as the ones made by Bethesda? They also made KOTOR II and I preferred the first KOTOR).",1706793113,1706793211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

About to have a breakdown before meeting my first wasteland enemy. Immediately quit and refunded the game(box copy at Gamestop).

Years pass by, was then a teenager. Saw the box art and some actual gameplay for FNV, decided to give the series another try. I became so engaged by the game on my second playthrough I traveled every inch of the Mojave looking for every location, gathering every unique, and Sunset Sarsaparilla star bottlecap. Not stopping until I'd seen every location with the explorer perk.

Fallout: New Vegas takes place during the year 2281 within the region surrounding the former city of Las Vegas (now called ""New Vegas""), around four years after the events of Fallout 3, and roughly around 204 years after the Great War of 2077. Players take control of a character known as the Courier. While transporting a package across the Mojave Desert to the city of New Vegas, what used to be Las Vegas, the Courier is ambushed, robbed of the package, shot, and buried in a cemetery. Ultimately the Courier is dug out and recovers from their wound. The Courier then begins a journey to find their would-be killer and recover the package, makes friends and enemies among various warring factions, and ultimately becomes caught up in a conflict that will determine who controls New Vegas and the Mojave Wasteland.

    [tr]
        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]Now the graphics in this game have not aged well either. Now granted it is a 12 year old game so it has aged a good bit, also the game engine was never anything to be impressed about either but its not bad. The game does look fine, and it doesn’t hurt the eyes, and yes you can mod it to make it look better. The graphics are not as bad as people make it out to be. I never had any issues with them. Rest assured in time you will get used to them and I think it fits the style of the game and gives you a nostalgic feel to it.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The gunplay is clunky, and has not aged well at all, but you will get used to it after a while. The game does have a V.A.T.S (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) which pauses time to pick a body part to shoot which helps a lot. Besides those issues, the gameplay is incredible. Fallout: New Vegas has so many RPG elements to it. You can play basically anyone you want, and that’s a huge plus for a shooter RPG. You have so many types of enemies that are really dangerous, and some that are a breeze to go through. All from mutated rats, to godzilla looking lizards called Deathclaws that can destroy you in one hit if you are not prepared. I can go on for hours about the gameplay, but let's move on to graphics.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]Fallout: New Vegas has a rich story and honestly the best in the Fallout franchise. With so many factions and so many endings, the replayability of the story alone is just mind boggling. Even the game ending is just an amazing moment and I love going through, it’s so intense. With many memorable characters with fun side quests, every playthrough I do, I feel like I'm seeing something new for the first time. The DLC’s are a must buy and cheap to get, as they have amazing stories as well and can really help boost your character too in terms of perks and unique playstyles. If you love a good, rich and dynamic story, please pick this game up, because you won’t be disappointed.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]The amount of playtime is nuts! With one character alone I put around 100+ Hours and still had missions to do and adventure. The world is huge in terms of content. The DLC’s are so well made as well. If I install this game again I can easily see myself adding another 200+ hours. The amount of choices you have and endings is incredible. Definitely one of the most replayable games out there. If you get mods, add that replayability by 10x![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The gun sounds are dated I will say (which is my only complaint in the sound department). The voice acting is really good in this game and the music is so fitting! The creatures sound absolutely scary and the bandits have good dialogue as well.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I will say one thing that is a huge negative are the bugs. My goodness does this game has a ton of them. Now there is an upside to this and that you can mod the game to improve it. This game has an active modding community. You can get the Anti Crash Mod, 4GB Patch, and Unofficial Patch mod so you won't have any crashes (or rarely any) and many bug fixes.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The game can have issues of course. You will need to get some mods that fix crashes (check the bug section). Also the frame rate can drop here and there (well on my specs). The optimization has surely aged poorly sadly. definitely the weakest part in the game.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]This is one of the best games ever, no doubt. There is a reason why a lot of people say this is one of the best “if not the best” Fallout game ever made. You can get totally immersed in this game. You play whoever you want. You can beat this game without killing anyone as well. The freedom this game has is so rare to see. Yes, the game has some issues and has dated visually. Luckily the issues this game has is fixable. If you are looking for an amazing RPG game, you have to get this game. It’s one of the best games to have been released. Just make sure to get some mods to fix the stability.[/td]

The GOAT[/I][/b]
[hr][/hr]

[I]Despite production problems such as budget cuts and short deadlines imposed by Bethesda on Obsidian, [b]Fallout: New Vegas[/b] found its own place amongst its brothers, not as a stillborn such as [/i]Fallout: Tactics[i] or [/i]Brotherhood of Steel[i], but as a sole bastard, misunderstood by the overlords of the franchise, but loved by the players.

Eccentric, playful and carefully built (despite its limitations and problems), [b]Fallout: New Vegas[/b] is a game of substance, one of the most recognizable and endearing titles of its franchise, despite Bethesda’s grand marketing campaigns to push its newer titles under the spotlight and cast a shadow over this gem.[/I]

[h2] GRAPHICS [/h2]
[i]★★☆☆☆
Unsatisfying[/I]
 Fallout: New Vegas’ graphics were already ugly when they first saw light in 2009. The outdated engine took its toll on gameplay systems and on the world design, but none suffered more than graphics.

One could blame the rushed development or tight budget, which might justify but not excuse the use of outdated technology for the game’s development. However, if you’re willing to believe in those rough and brutish graphics, letting go of the need of being aesthetically pleasant, there is [b]much more[/b] down the rabbit hole.

[h2] GAMEPLAY [/h2]
[i]★★★☆☆
Satisfying[/i]

Fallout: New Vegas is a captivating fusion of FPS and RPG mechanics. Its FPS elements, while rooted in the legacy of Fallout 3's mechanics, showcase satisfying gunplay and a diverse arsenal of weaponry. FNV innovated with iron sights, the strategic use of different ammo types and other small tweaks. While some FPS features, such as sprinting or dedicated grenade buttons, remain absent, Fallout: New Vegas's unique pace ensures a captivating gaming experience.

Also, it shines as a true RPG. A thoughtful approach to leveling, in which meticulous planning shapes definitively your characters strengths and weaknesses, is essential for success. Dialogue options demand careful consideration, as your words can impact the game's narrative and the reactions of its dwellers. The game's NPCs, despite the limitations in their scripting and voice acting, are designed in a way that gives them flashes of true humanity. Karma and reputation systems further enhance the RPG experience, influencing encounters, loot, and the overall trajectory of your journey.

Quests in Fallout: New Vegas consistently present themselves as intriguing challenges, offering a sense of accomplishment upon completion. The game's conclusion ensures that your actions and decisions throughout the journey will bear significant consequences, leaving a lasting impact on the world you have shaped.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]ATMOSPHERE & SETTING[/h2]
[I]★★★★☆
Mesmerizing[/I]

The Mojave Wasteland, despite occasional emptiness, presents a bleak yet quirky environment. Production issues may explain its sparse nature, but it aligns with the idea of the desert and its oasis, contested by powerful factions. It's empty so the few things it has jump to our eyes while we search for very little, in a very scarce place.

What redeems the game is its player-centric map design. In contrast to Fallout 3's sprawling but confusing Capital Wasteland, FNV features (more or less) well-connected towns, outposts, and marketplaces where small societies thrive. The northern crown jewel offers a central point amidst the vast wilderness, providing both interesting surprises and moments of terror during extensive journeys through the desert's sands and languid biomes.

The integration of a seamless tutorial, a clear progression route, and the enchanting narration by Wayne Newton, accompanied by iconic music, make the Mojave an enticing home for players who like to wander.

[h2]STORY[/h2]
[I]★★★★★
Outstanding[/I]

[I][no major spoilers included][/I]
[spoiler]
Fallout: New Vegas takes place in the Mojave desert in 2287, in an alternate universe. In this world, microtechnology wasn’t developed further such as in ours. Without transistors, scientists employed their efforts in mastering atomic technologies, such as fusion reactors. A great crisis in fossil fuels and later atomic fuels pressured the new “Cold War” between the United States of America and China into total nuclear annihilation in 2077.

Nations slowly rebuilt, many years after the war, and in 2287, two new nations of this disfigured world are engaged in skirmishes after an armed conflict over an oasis, standing in the middle of the forgotten Mojave: New Vegas. While Los Angles, Washington DC, New York and other major cities fell quickly under bombardment, Las Vegas stood as the last bastion of the Old World. Its casinos opened up again, neon lights and extravaganza never seen before the Great War.

You are a courier for the Mojave Express delivery service, tasked with taking goods across the Mojave. One night, one of your deliveries takes a turn for the worse.

Left for dead, you have to regain your strength and walk again the Mojave after revenge, for you know, better than anyone else, the game was rigged from the start.
[/spoiler]
The game has rich lore, expanded thanks to the franchise’s original developers, who worked at Obsidian during the time of New Vegas.

[h2]DLCs[/h2]
[i]★★★☆☆
Satisfying[/i]

Here’s a list of the game’s DLCs, in the order I completed them, which [b]I recommend[/b]:
[olist]
[*] Honest Hearts→ Captivating story, beautiful although poorly designed map.
[*] Old World Blues → Fun, engaging and rewarding for curiosity. Not the best story.
[*] Dead Money → Challenging enough to make gamers work hard for it, but not so much as to be just a grind or impossible. It is the most difficult one of all four, and can be the most rewarding, as well. It brings in the game a component of horror which fits well. 
[*] Lonesome Road → Second most difficult one. Interesting story, intriguing and eerie atmosphere. Introduces interesting mechanics, as well as more locations for the player to explore before the endgame.
[/olist]

Fallout: New Vegas’ DLCs bring forth new weaponry, equipment, armor and interesting stories for the player. It must be noted that some DLCs, while short, can be tedious at times. Still, their characters are always fresh and interesting.
[hr][/hr]
[h2]PERSONAL TAKE[/h2]
Fallou: New Vegas is my favorite game of all time. I had it on the Xbox 360, I bought it for PC as well, and if they ever port it to newer platforms and it is a decent port, I’ll have it as well.

FNV is a mindset. I get lost in its world just like I do in GTA IV. It speaks to me in a personal level. It's an outstandng work of the game industry, a refined [I]magnum opus[/I] from 2009, even with all of its flaws, that stands the test of time with its everlasting and maturing qualities. No game that I have seen, so far, could quite replicate the same precision and tasteful artistic quality that Fallout: New Vegas had when portraying its story and world. FNV inspired other games and spawned Outer Worlds, another Obsidian title, out of its own success.

Fallout: New Vegas makes you feel a part of that world, it enables you to shape it however you want, but it will always punish you for the things that we forget: that war never changes.

I would like to see its legacy continue through creative choices in future games in the series, a hope that is naïve, to be fair, and through old and new players enjoying it and I'm pleased that I've been seeing it happening more and more.

New Vegas is an underdog that has shown very well it can be king by conquering its place in the hearts of fans.

And it probably can conquer its rightful place in your favourite games if you give it a try.",1703013535,1706651680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When it comes to freedom of choice, this game doesn't just talk the talk; it walks it, sprints it, and cartwheels through it. Want to be a machete-wielding maniac? Sure. A sharpshooting gunslinger? Absolutely. Or perhaps you prefer the dynamite-hurling approach? The choice is yours, and the possibilities are as vast as the Mojave Wasteland itself.

What sets Fallout: New Vegas apart from the crowd is its staggering array of weapons. From makeshift contraptions like dog tag knuckles to elegant firearms like engraved revolvers, the game's arsenal is a testament to creativity and variety. And let's not forget the explosive options, ranging from humble dynamite to apocalyptic rocket launchers—there's something for every wasteland wanderer.

But what truly elevates Fallout: New Vegas is its commitment to player agency. In a world where every decision matters, you can chart your own path without ever lifting a finger in violence. Align yourself with legionnaires, soldiers, or cunning gangsters—the choice is yours, and the consequences are yours to bear.

With four distinct endings and playthroughs that stretch into the double digits, Fallout: New Vegas is a testament to replayability.

For a game that I first played 10 years after it's release, I stopped thinking about it's age after character creation. The mechanics are somewhere between FO3 and FO4, which, in my opinion, affords it a replay-ability that far exceeds that of FO3. It shows the darker side of the Fallout universe, with characters and decisions as equally as dark.

fallout: new vegas takes what's likeable about fallout 3 - the vats system, the charming nonsense of the combat, the goofy physics engine - while ditching the elements of that game which were less intuitive to roleplaying: the linear questline and the sense that the actions you take are decided for you before you've made the character

buy the game on its own, you will keep discovering new quests, or discovering new methods of resolving ones you thought you'd already exhausted the options in; buy the dlcs, you get four new worlds to navigate and decide the fate of, each of which succeeds in getting you to think about the wasteland, its people and its future in different ways

add mods and this game feels like even more of a unique labour of love created by fans of roleplaying games and fans of blowing up people's heads

It proceeds to exit the casino, picking up pace as it tours the Strip while ""Blue Moon"" slowly becomes fainter amidst the background of the carousal about the street.

While on the Strip, we see the main hotels and a mixture of drunk NCR military members and civilians walk in the streets. Three Securitrons startle a pedestrian as they roll towards the Ultra-Luxe. The camera zooms out further to the perimeter of the auroral city to an NCR Veteran Ranger firing a lethal shot from their anti-materiel rifle at an armed Fiend just beyond the confines of New Vegas.

The camera fades out in flames to a distant hillside. A scout uses his binoculars to observe the city of New Vegas and outer Vegas, while explosions faintly ring around the city. Beside him is a banner, bearing the mark of Caesar's Legion. Legionaries rush behind him as a Legion explorer waves them through. Once more, the camera resumes even further from the city distinguishable only by its glow amidst the dark, night air of the Mojave.

Only issue was with the weapon hotkeys - the corner weapons are a bit awkward to swap to. Up-right and up-left sometimes makes you swap ammo (triggered by the up button on the d-pad) which is really frustrating in the middle of the fight, because you start reloading your gun with a new ammo type that won't be helpful, so you press the button again (or several times to cycle through different ammo types) to get the right one. The only time I had to manually invoke the keyboard was at the very beginning when loading the game/ creating the character, and never again. 

It only crashed a handful of times near the end of the game. Otherwise, runs stable on the steam deck and I have had no real issues. There were maybe a few areas with lag - but surprisingly, not at hoover dam. /Might be a location based thing with certain areas in the game.

Diving into the gameplay itself: 8/10. Engaging story and really funny at times. The world was fun to explore. Really loved how all your skills felt useful, and you're not punished for not focusing on charisma like other games of this type. 

The DLC's were also phenomenal overall. Sierra Madre is my personal favourite (and the most frustrating) - it just felt the most accurate to the message of what Las Vegas was.

I wasn't a huge fan of modding the weapons, and think other games have better UI systems to do that, but it wasn't a big deal. Do wish there were more options when it came to modifying your weapons though. 

The weakest part of the game was definitely the combat. Whether it was the game engine obsidian had to use, the short timeline they had, or the effort being placed into other more important areas (or more likely a combination of all 3,) it's the part that has aged the worst. Shooting doesn't feel great, and some weapons don't work on enemies up close when you are in VATS. It feels like when you're out of VAT's, you can shoot somebody 20 times in the chest and only have 2 of the bullets actually make combat. The game makes up for less then stellar shooting mechanics with fun weapons and enemies, which saves the combat. Otherwise, if you've played any modern game that had guns in it, most of them will feel better then this. 

Will play again to explore other options. This is a good game. If you've been on the fence on checking it out, take the dive.",1706138386,1706138386,True,1,0,0.501079916954040527,0,True,False,False

if your competent at clicking your mouse you should be fine, 

this title is one of the goats in fantastic story writing, rpg elements, lore, music,character and passion, obsidian had everything thrown at them by good old bethesda and they still showed bethesda how to make an rpg just like they did with the outerworlds.

Fallout: New Vegas stands as a classic video game title, often hailed as a masterpiece and one of the greatest games ever created. During my formative years, I delved into the post-apocalyptic world of New Vegas multiple times on the Xbox 360—a title that managed to be both enjoyable and flawed.

The campaign is gripping, offering the allure of diverse endings. The inclusion of a karma system adds depth, prompting players to navigate the moral complexities of the Fallout universe. Will you seize and hoard, or adhere to a virtuous path? The decision to align with the NCR or Caesar's Legion further enhances the player's agency.

Engaging gameplay, coupled with enjoyable gunplay, makes battling unique and varied enemies a highlight. However, the game is not without its flaws, with potential game-breaking glitches cropping up, particularly during quests.

In essence, Fallout: New Vegas is a stellar title with the potential for multiple playthroughs, provided one possesses the time and patience to navigate its immersive, yet occasionally glitch-ridden, world.

Pros:
- Fun gameplay
- Great campaign
- Fun side missions
- Fun enemies (except for cazadors)
- Interesting characters

Cons:
- Game breaking glitches can occur
- CAZADORS!!!!!

The best true RPG of our lifetimes.

I should start out by saying; I am supremely biased. FNV was the first western RPG I had ever experienced when I got it on the Xbox 360 in early 2011, and since then I've played nearly 1,500 hours of it across 12 playthroughs of ~120 hours each. It is my favorite game of all time, but not necessarily because of nostalgia. Fallout: New Vegas has, to my mind, never been surpassed in its pairing of roleplaying and narrative flexibility, by any game since its release - and I've played The Witcher 3, so you know this game must have something special. Therefore, that's what this review must prove.

When you start a new game, most of everything you need to know about the plot of New Vegas is laid out for you in one of Fallout's many iconic slideshows, but if you are entirely new to the franchise, I'd suggest clicking here. Otherwise, I'll just state that New Vegas is much more connected to the stories of Fallout's 1 & 2 than 3 or 4, due to it being set on the West Coast, and is in some ways a continuation of the story from Fallout 2. The rest, I'd rather not spoil. Although, in this specific Fallout... You are a courier, hired by the Mojave Express, to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip. What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn... for the worse.

Due to the fact that the only stipulation placed on the backstory of your character is that you were at one point in time a courier, the character you create can essentially be anyone you want them to be. If you have the ability to coherently write a character, FNV becomes your own narrative playground; one of my favorite elements of the game. The character creation tools presented at the start of the game are suitably expansive as well; between skills, tags, and traits. Further progression in New Vegas is also superb, as you raise your skills accordingly and select from many game-altering, or at least useful, perks. The character creation and progression in FNV is exemplary.

In FNV there is a plethora of dialogue, choices, consequences, and other roleplaying mechanics to be found. These systems all work together in perfect harmony, which puts real weight behind your actions. This could even mean small actions, such as how you talk to a companion changing their character arc. Speaking of talking, the dialogue system is especially of note, as this is where most decisions are made, and where you express the personality of your character. There are always a stunning amount of choices you can make, and you'll never feel like a viable option was left out - in any situation. Many of your decisions even leave lasting effects on the Mojave, which I'll explain in greater detail later on.

New Vegas is well known for its intricately constructed faction system and politics, as you can choose from one of four main factions to end the game with, as well as affect nearly two dozen other minor factions - either by aiding or hindering them. Each organization has their own backstory and lore, and all of them have quest lines worth delving into. These groups will remember how you treat them, which builds a lasting relationship between them and the player. It's these dynamic factions that really bring the world to life through their thematic depth, and give the Mojave a lived-in feel.

Now that you have a sense of this game's successes, I'd like to highlight why it's my favorite game. Because of how incredibly detailed and lore-dense the Fallout series is, the jaw-dropping amount of narrative flexibility in New Vegas is what seals the deal for me. The ability to shape the Mojave as I see fit, a world that is so well realized, is unbelievably tantalizing to me; and I don't think any RPG has handled this better. It makes me feel like such a tour de force, that it's my character making these monumental decisions, and changing the future of a whole region - forever.

FNV takes place in the Mojave Wasteland, clearly, and the desolate design of this setting establishes a highly authentic apocalyptic atmosphere. I find the vanilla graphics to be timeless because of this, but mods can certainly modernize them. The region is a joy to explore too, as there are countless locations with pieces of environmental storytelling, quests, and loot within them. There's also an optional hardcore mode, which makes these barren wastes just that much harder to survive.

As a side note, I'll quickly state that almost every side-quest in New Vegas is spectacular. They were crafted with the utmost attention to detail, as they all have several ways to progress through them; and sincerely thoughtful writing applied to them. Each storyline has a distinct and often original motif, which makes them all a pleasure to play and experience.

Another important part of the game are the companions and characters, who all share one thing in common; purpose. Every follower has their own quests, backstories, and motivating factors that make them relatable to the player, and from even the most minor of (named) characters to the most important, everyone has identifiable personality traits. No one feels like wasted potential. These honest personas are what grounds your adventures in FNV, by making you truly care about the Mojave and its inhabitants.

Changing tone, Fallout: New Vegas' combat is fun, but also clunky. Shooting, stabbing, bludgeoning, disintegrating, and exploding your adversaries is what you'll spend most of your time doing when not exploring the wastes or having a pleasant chat, and this level of variety is where the strength of the combat lies. Just because it's clunky, doesn't mean there isn't visceral joy to be had. The V.A.T.S. system has also returned, but I don't personally use it. In essence the combat is just good enough to impress, but modding, which I'll mention later, can improve in considerably.

The biggest downfall of New Vegas is, undeniably, its performance. This is almost entirely the engine's fault; Bethesda have never been known for their technical aptitude in games creation - and Obsidian had to make do. Minor bugs run rampant, as well as crashes if you don't make necessary tweaks to the .ini files, which you can look up to discover what I'm talking about. The game also stutters often, but mods can alleviate this issue for the most part. My advice would be to save often, and install a few mods, which is the next topic.

One of the greatest parts about Fallout: New Vegas, and the post-Fallout 3 series in general, is its customizability. Anything from simple fixes to new quests, and visual overhauls to gameplay tweaks can be added to the game, and to do this I'd recommend the FNV Nexus.[www.nexusmods.com] I'd suggest watching some tutorials on how to mod the game, and from there NVSE, NVSR, NVAC, and Project Nevada are all essential mods as far as I'm concerned, but it's up to you. Visual mods are also welcome, however they're subjective so I won't recommend any here. All considered; modding: a useful skill for any FNV player.

I hope I've made my case as to why this is my favorite game clear. It's not the best at everything it does, but what it does do correctly is simply exactly what I want from a game. The roleplaying, decision making, characters, world, lore, narrative - and so much more, just binds together into such a cohesive package of everything I ask for from an open world RPG, that I can't resist it's call. And, if I remember correctly (but of course I do, I could never forget), it sounds a little like this...

I got spurs that Jingle Jangle, Jingle!

For anyone who takes what they purchase into consideration seriously, I'm sure you have already heard about Fallout: New Vegas' cult classic status; so to be brief, I would like to add a small part that many reviews leave out of the discussion.

Despite hailing it as the best RPG I've played and recommending it to genre newcomers, Fallout: New Vegas is not a hardcore RPG, however, nor is its combat system that deep. It’s a unique balance that's hard to find in the modern RPG landscape. It's straightforward to start playing, the world is engaging, and the systems, even without a tutorial, are fair and easy to understand. I would highly recommend it to anyone who's starting in the RPG world, rather than a Ubisoft or other Bethesda title; as decisions genuinely feel as if they have a tangible impact on the story. It’s a great balance between dialogue-focused RPGs such as (the more modern) Disco Elysium, whilst remaining engaging enough for players more familiar with FPS combat systems to jingle, jangle, jingle.

This is an important distinction, as Fallout: New Vegas, unlike other RPGs, always has an enduring sense of progression both in terms of narrative, but also gameplay. Although the balancing late-game is not perfect, it still represents the best blend of complex RPG systems with clear feedback. Clear feedback is often lacking in older and more rigid RPG systems from the late 1990s and early 2000s, where it was always unclear to what extent the skills had on gameplay. Fallout: New Vegas ensures that you have a clear understanding of how your character is progressing... Now ain't that a kick in the head!

That said, even with my 640 hours, clearly this game is not completely stable, especially on modern hardware. If you seek to play New Vegas regularly, installing some stability mods will ensure your experience won't make you wish for a nuclear winter.

the atmosphere was also not really it for me. when i think of fallout, i think of a post-nuke world. one that looks sad and empty, near destroyed just like fo3. i know in fnv it has been 'a while' since the bombs fell, but it still did not give me enough of a wasteland vibe. the world doesn't just fix itself quickly after a whole nuke falls. it needs to look around the same. they had a big chance to do this and make vegas lights and casinos look scary or apocalyptic... yet they didn't. that's a definite loss. i actually believe the only main thing i liked from this game was the faction honor system rather than a general honor system, as well as the disguises. that's about it. 

in terms of comparison: fo3 has yet to give me any issues and is definitely my favorite so far. it has crashed probably 1-5 times since ive had it and have played for around triple the hours i have for new vegas. new vegas is near unplayable even with the crash mods, johnny guitar mod, etc. etc. was not worth the full price. i wish i could return it.

tldr: i recommend it if you're very patient and willing to troubleshoot... a LOT. if you are impatient when a game crashes (i.e. raging) or hate saving super often or hate having to install add-ons to make your game even remotely playable, do not install this game. itll be a waste of time. most of the hours you rack up will be from having to reopen the game after it shits itself.",1705962708,1705963305,False,0,0,0.485436886548995972,0,True,False,False

Bethesda doesn't understand what Fallout is.

Bethesda games aren't tales about humanity or darkly funny satires. They are empty, soulless worlds, built as a playground that favors non-linear exploration. Bethesda's Fallouts are not about people. They are simply visual copies of iconic elements that were part of the original games, but without any depth in its context. Thoughtless.

Writing, in the artistic sense, in the sense of ""constructing and saying something with words"", for a change, is something almost non-existent in games like Fallout 4.

Wasting this universe in this way, having access to all the budget and talent in the world, is almost a crime.

But look: They at least know how to craft visually immersive experiences. Systemic worlds rich in environment details and atmosphere, inviting and easy to get lost within them. This must be why these games still sell despite all their problems.

But what if there was a game that managed to combine both things? A game that favors free exploration and little fun diversions in an immersive form and fills the gaps that gives context to the world with very well written stories full of charm and humanity? Really good characters? What if the world had some kind of aesthetic and narrative cohesion? Some overarching narrative juiciness that permeated almost every area of ​​the game?

What if we finally had a real ""Fallout 3""?

This is New Vegas. A majestic obisidian stone, which dwarfs any effort made by Bethesda since then.

Problematic, technologically dated and lacking some mods to run properly, but inexhaustible in its brilliance.

Years pass and this game never seems to get old.

I can play Fallout 3 & 4 for ten years and not remember anything other than the controls.

I can go ten years without playing New Vegas and i'll still remember the cowboy robot from the casino. I will remember MR. House, Yes Man, Benny, The Burned Man. I will remember the vault with overgrown plants and the giant rusty dinosaur. I'll remember the giant killer flies. I would remember so much that I couldn't fit into Steam's maximum word count.

I frankly can't even conjure up enough words to describe how easy it is to get lost within this game. The groove, the stories, the main conflict, the characters, the ballads on the radio, the allure and beauty of the wastelands.

This is an open world game whose the monotony of this type of design doesn't slow down the experience. They managed to make a game so big, so narratively heavy, not feel extremely slow-paced, like most RPGS today and of the time, let alone CRPGS like the Original Fallout. The pace is just right. Delicious right.

And even the combat, which is its worst part, has a functional and satisfying simplicity, due to the sense of impact from the sound design and the balance of the difficulty.
 
It's simply fantastic.

HBomberguy (On YouTube) made two videos about Fallout. One about Fallout 3 (And how it compares to the originals) and another about New Vegas. These are perhaps the two best videos about Fallout that exist on the internet.

These are long videos that are very easy and fun to watch, which provide an in-depth analysis of the qualities of these games and, ultimately, propel any viewer to have a deeper appreciation of the successes and mistakes between Obisidian and Bethesda.

If everything else seems redundant in this review, at least watch the videos. They are more than enough.

[hr][/hr]
Now about those necessary fixes and mods:

1.New Vegas Script Extender

2. New Vegas Tick Fix

Furthermore, it may be necessary to add a few lines of code to disable mouse acceleration, which makes the mouse hypersensitive in menus.

Google it to find the solution.

You may be able to bypass the use of these mods by simply modifying the game to run at 64 FPS via your graphics card's control panel.

Disable the game's VSYNC and activate the card's, limiting the FPS to 64.

This can apparently solve the game's tick issues, which cause stuttering and crashes on modern systems. If that doesn't work, go to the mod.",1705866227,1705929586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The amount of decisions and different paths you can take is truely astonishing and shows how much work the developers put into this title, even though they were given only a rather short amount of time to work on it. 

Let's directly begin with the best thing of the game. The amount of freedom of choices you are given. You want to be a genuinely good person who cares about others and help the poor and powerless? No problem, just do it. You want to be a complete psychopath who murders his way through the wasteland, steals and lies to everyone, while even commiting heinous acts like cannibalism? No problem, you can just do that. Depending on how you choose to behave, the perk system will offer an absurdly high amount of character traits, that all feel quite unique. Add a massive arsenal of weapons, different ammo types and armor to it and everyone will be able to find something that fits his playstyle. The world the game throws you into is full of detail, interesting places to explore, strange and funny characters and different factions you can work for, work against or even join their ranks. The available DLC's are a must have and add different setpieces, more perks, unique items and hard decision to your experience. 

Now let's shortly talk about the bad stuff, because the game definitely isn't perfect. The stability and bugs can be a true problem and turn your fun experience into a frustrating one. Certain mods are basically needed if you want to get rid of these problems, thankfully they are pretty easy to install, even when you don't know a lot about modding. I also recommend some visual mods, because the game already looked quite outdated when it was released in 2010 and don't forget to add some quality of life features on top of it, like a better UI. 

New Vegas is a phenomenal RPG which has some flaws here and there, however the attention of detail the developers put into it and the high amount of replayability, will make you forget these smaller problems.

Its quirkiness, storytelling, gameplay, all of it draws in me in better than what Bethesda puts out. They treat it like a black sheep but it's really that one successful sibling while its Bethesda made step-siblings who do have financial success but are generally frowned upon for a myriad of reasons. Like divorce lawyers.

Though limited because of an 18-Month Development Period, Obsidian delivered a treasured gem that gets the most attention from the fanbase outside of the countdown and release date of newer titles; Fallout 4 and 76.

When I got into PC gaming this game was one of my early go-tos after enduring a broken borrowed copy on Xbox 360. Throughout high school, during the days I was often bedridden during recovery from surgeries to my spine and left leg because of scoliosis. I played New Vegas most often on a HP Compaq nc8430 laptop (I was in a low income household, no money for gaming laptops) and aside from that - TF2 and Minecraft.

New Vegas is such a part of my life that during one of my surgeries I dreamed I was there in the Mojave Wasteland myself. The sun beating down on me, my only shade a cowboy hat and sipping a Sunset Sarsaparilla to quench my thirst. I don't remember much of it, only that it felt real and that I was content there. Someday I will visit the real Goodsprings, Primm, and so on. Maybe I'll even live there one day.

This latest playthrough was my ""No More Tours"" run, the end of the road for this Courier Six. Got all the achievements, did everything right (Independent/House, Nuked NCR and Legion, convinced the Khans to break their ties with Caesar and go East, etc.). Then I went back to my favorite modded player home (NV Novac Apartment) and decided to call it an end there.

I might start it up again, give the Mojave another go eventually but for now... It's time to rest. Kick off those spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle and leave the Big Iron in its holster.

To the devs that worked on this, to New Vegas itself and to that one bark scorpion I've always blasted on the way up to the Goodspings Cemetery.

Pros -
Choices have real consequences
Unlimited freedom right off leaving the starting sequence
Build variety
Multiple methods of completing every quest in the game 
Incredible DLC's (even those that are hated like Dead Money)
Great ending making people wonder who would have been the best choice still to this day.
Great modding community
Funny dialogue options just like all other fallout titles

Cons - 
Pretty dated now so visual enhancement mods would be good to install before playing
Controls can feel slightly clunky at the beginning
Whilst I still enjoyed dead money the constant trap gimmicks are cringe
Caravan is boring and the game would probably be better without it included but you can just ignore this

Not surprisingly, it has better writing, better world-building and better gameplay than Fallout 3, not to mention more content and a better sense of actually [i]being[/i] a Fallout game. If you're a fan of the series and haven't played this yet, I 100% recommend this to you and you should probably go play it ASAP.


Fallout: New Vegas is an FPS-RPG hybrid like FO3 was, which means both traditional Fallout stat progression and real-time skill play a part in gameplay. Some of the stats influence how good your character is at real-time combat as well as combat in the VATS targeting system, which uses Action Points to determine how many actions you can take at once.

Those stats determine how much damage you do and how accurate your weapons are. Non-combat stats affect a range of other activities; Lockpicking for example lets your character break more and more challenging locks.


Like FO3, you can block using melee weapons. Unlike FO3, you can perform special moves in VATS if your melee skill is high enough. Ironsights on firearms can be used to aim (the shooting is usually alright) and the companion menu has been redesigned as an ergonomic radial. The Big Guns skill was also merged into the Guns skill.

Of special mention is Hardcore mode. It gives ammunition weight like in the classic games, which means you can't carry around 5,000 bullets and rockets anymore. You also have hunger, hydration and sleep to manage, and health items heal over time instead of all at once. It's both a throwback to classic Fallout and a newer challenge, one that I personally enjoyed.

It also makes the Survival skill - the continuation of the classic Outdoosman skill - that much more useful, making comestibles more efficient and letting you craft more items at campfires. The crafting isn't very intrusive or even strictly required; it's a neat alternative to looting and bartering for everything you need and a source of unique items.


The DLC, if you bought any of it, consists of four expansion packs with new areas, and two packs of additional items. I mention this because [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/72840]one of these packs[/url] consists of items sold by vendors and additional Challenges you can perform with them for XP (although there is [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/46138]a mod[/url] to have the weapons scattered around the wasteland) and the other pack is a combination of the four preorder bonus packs.

You receive them at the very start of the game, so I would suggest turning them off for your first playthrough to avoid cheatiness. It's 99 cents, and you can separately enable each pack; of course on subsequent playthroughs I'd recommend it for the classic pack alone so you can have maximum Fallout 2.

Since this is a Fallout game, and a game developed with Bethesda's Gamebryo engine, it can be sluggish and buggy at times. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=164659260]This guide[/url] can help you optimize your game and learn how to install mods if you so desire. Aside from the mods linked in that guide, other mods I would recommend for repeat playthroughs include [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42033/?]a mod that stops installed DLC from spamming you at the beginning[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39218/?]a mod that improves NPC characterization[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37002/?]a mod that adds weapons from the first two games[/url]. That would be a good start for an enhanced game: the mod community for this game is huge.


As for the plot and writing, I mean it when I say it's miles ahead of FO3. New Vegas is an actual [i]good example of writing[/i] in a major videogame. The game world may still be pretty well-preserved for 200+ years after a catastrophic nuclear war, but the desert/frontier environment mean it's not totally unbelievable.

NV's main factions are well done. You have the return of the New California Republic, which is facing off against the raiders-writ-large Caesar's Legion over control of the Hoover Dam. (The Legion and the inclusion of the Dam originated with the canceled Fallout 3 originally being made by Black Isle, which is [url=http://www.moddb.com/games/f3-van-buren]currently being remade as a mod[/url].) In the middle lies independent New Vegas, as well as other smaller groups both familiar and new. There is depth and nuance to rival the first two games to the point where I was reminded of the classic book [i]A Canticle for Leibowitz[/i], which deals with similar themes and was apparently inspiration for some of NV's worldbuilding.


The game world does seem a little compacted, but that's largely a necessary gameplay conceit. You are somewhat railroaded at the beginning of the game due to quest progression and monster placement, but once you reach New Vegas itself, the game really does open up.

This doesn't strictly stop you from going anywhere on the map from the beginning, but you'll need skill - or a lower difficulty setting I guess - to get past the powerful monsters lying in certain directions. The first two games had this sort of soft railroading as well, so it's not without precedent.

The new radio stations are both less annoying than Galaxy News Radio and less gratingly repetitive than Enclave Radio. There's a good amount of ambient and incidental music too, some of which is even taken from the first three games and can be a treat to hear.


Overall, if you're looking for a good action RPG, if you have the time to spare for it & a computer to run it on I would recommend this. Just don't forget to optimize it if you're having trouble running it.",1423349988,1705803021,True,2,0,0.52602541446685791,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1561989342,1705799526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- While offering some of the greatest freedom of any FO game, all end game choices resolve the same way - a battle at Hoover Dam that remains largely unchanged
- The achievements are dog shit. There's not a soul alive who wants to play 30 games of Caravan or eat 7 bajillion pieces of food while drowning themselves just to hit an artificial goal-post
- Repeat after me. OPEN WORLD GAMES SHOULD NOT HAVE GRIND ACHIEVEMENTS. It defeats the entire purpose
- The game is unplayable without mods. Period. If anyone else tells you otherwise, they're lying to your face. 10+ mods to fix bugs and apply QOL, and I was still crashing to the desktop and experiencing surreal amounts of jank
- For all it touts in terms of worldbuilding and great characters, even so you will be bored of them by the 25 hour mark
- Did I mention UNREASONABLE AMOUNTS OF JANK? 30% of the time my NPCs were hopping up and down like spazzing bunnies
- Several CTDs even after applying a medically unreasonable amount of bug fixing mods

I could go on. Back in the day when I bought this game I remember enjoying it, but upon 100%ing it, it is clear to me why I stopped in the first place.

Incredible world building, atmospheric environment, extremely content rich in story and depth, well thought out characters for both good and evil, I would also like to mention that FNV has very complex story telling abilities. There is no such thing as predictability in New Vegas, actions and decisions always have a side affect or consequence, plenty of grey and morally complicated characters, the game's conclusion is never completely bliss (just like real life) depending on your character, choices, morale, your ending will be heavily affected by this. Even if you chose a very honourable play through you will only achieve 80% happiness or satisfaction, 20% will be things out of your control. A grounded game with a Sci-Fi twist.

This was horrible for me, because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son, because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube. So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my survivor and level and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died. Since then, this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well. This game reminded me that there is fun in everything, and I brought many happy memories to me and my son.

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
One and 19 more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip
21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip

[h2]Gameplay Impressions:[/h2]
New Vegas kicks off with a bang as you find yourself shot in the head and left for dead. But fear not, because nothing says ""Welcome to the Mojave"" like a good old-fashioned assassination attempt! The open-world exploration is as vast as the nuclear wasteland itself, and every decision you make shapes the narrative. Whether you're siding with the New California Republic, Caesar's Legion, or forging your own path, expect consequences – both hilarious and heart-wrenching.

[h2]What I liked:[/h2]
• [b]Choice and Consequence:[/b] Fallout: New Vegas shines in its narrative depth. Your decisions matter, and the branching storylines offer a level of replayability that's rarer than a bottle of Nuka-Cola in the desert. Each quest feels like a mini-drama, with multiple ways to tackle problems and outcomes that will leave you questioning your moral compass.
• [b]Wild Wasteland Perk:[/b] If you're not playing with the Wild Wasteland perk, you're doing it wrong. From encountering a crashed UFO to stumbling upon a refrigerator with a certain someone inside, the bizarre humor and pop-culture references scattered throughout the game add an extra layer of entertainment. Trust me, you want to embrace the weirdness.
• [b]Companion Dynamics:[/b] Your ragtag group of companions is like a dysfunctional post-apocalyptic family. Each one comes with their own quirks, stories, and combat skills. From the sassy robot ED-E to the suave sniper Boone, these companions are more than just glorified backpacks – they're your partners in crime (and irradiated mutant-slaying).

[h2]What I didn't like:[/h2]
• [b]Technical Glitches:[/b] The Mojave might be vast, but so are the game's bugs. From floating objects to occasional crashes, be prepared for a few technical hiccups. It's like the game's way of saying, ""Hey, even the apocalypse has its glitches.""
• [b]Graphics Aging:[/b] While New Vegas was a visual marvel in its time, the graphics haven't aged like a fine wine. Expect character models that look more like mutated mannequins than realistic survivors. It's a minor gripe, but if you're used to cutting-edge visuals, this might be a radioactive eyesore.
• [b]Combat can be Clunky:[/b] While the VATS system adds a strategic element to combat, the real-time shooting can feel a bit clunky. If you're expecting the precision of a military-trained sharpshooter, you might be disappointed. It's more like you're stumbling through the wasteland with a slightly malfunctioning BB gun.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
Fallout: New Vegas is a diamond in the rough of the post-apocalyptic gaming landscape. Its engaging narrative, quirky humor, and the sheer freedom to shape your destiny make it a must-play for any wasteland wanderer. Despite its technical quirks and aging graphics, the Mojave Wasteland is a place worth exploring – just watch out for the cazadores. They sting, both in-game and to your pride.",1696267531,1705479840,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
22380,156153818,76561198045339260,0,9,67311,2,67309,1708761373,"What is there to say about New Vegas that hasn't been said? You start as a Courier and that is all you know about yourself. It's probably the most blank slate-start in the whole Fallout series, letting you be whoever you want (and if you ignore all the lore from Lonesome Road pushed onto you). Want to be a 16 year old kiddo from the wasteland doing their first job? No problem. How about Easy Pete, an old, weathered miner with a love for dynamite? Also easy. I even played a James Bond-wanna be who only used 9mm pistols and focused on Speech, Sneak and Guns, which is pretty powerful actually. 

The faction story lines all have the same beats but to different tunes, while the leaders and people giving you quests have very different personalities. Smug Mr House, who will turn 4 this summer, superior Edward Sallow, or Caesar, the NCR, or always chipper Yes-Man. 

The factions, so much fun, depth and love. Followers of the Apocalpyse all the way for me! They are my favorite in all of Fallout. Legion has suffered from the short time to develop and I think they are among the weaker factions in New Vegas, I don't like their LARP gear too much, but they are still interesting and certainly very strong and dangerous. And oh so many more, Elvis-fan boys, people trying to rebuild the US of A, bikers without bikes who want to be Mongols, not to mention the Strip's gangs/tribes! 

Then the quests as a whole, so much fun. Skills mean something, you can get results from SPECIAL, skills and perks. Interrogating someone can be done in several ways, from beating them up, being smart or mocking them. 
On that note, you can actually beat the game by killing no one, there are no mandatory kills, no Alduin you have to game, no Kellog that needs some serious not-looking because the companion you dismissed just in that room killed Kellog, no. New Vegas lets you finish the game without a single kill, without a single weapon discharge. On the other hand you can also kill everyone but children and Yes-Man (who respawns, spoiler, because he's a program, not a unique robot). 

Within the confines of the game and story you can be whoever you want, no Shawn, no Daddy, no Vault or tribe, you are just a delivery person trying to do their job. That is the only real limit, your job. 

And that is all without any mods! But if you add those, oh boy, things do get so much wilder! More guns? No problem, from photorealistic ones to mash-ups of base game guns. Mroe outfits? Easy too. And all the quests possible, some as big and even bigger than most DLC, almost bigger than the base game! 

Is it perfect, tho? No, it absolutely is not. Without mods it's rather unstable and buggy and can crarsh often, so hit that quicksave very often. It's not the best looking game, not even for its time, the gun play is probably also not up to snuff any longer, the blank slate-character is not for everyone...

I'd still absolutely recommend the game to anyone who enjoys roleplay, action and exploration in a post-apocalyptic world that is on the way of improving itself.

When I was was 12, I played Fallout: New Vegas on the PS3. It was the greatest story ever told in a video game, it was chock full of choices that made me carefully consider and weight the options, and I got to make them while spinning a cool revolver and wearing a cowboy hat. By the time I had finished the game, Freeside ran at 4 FPS. Nothing would ever top Fallout: New Vegas in my mind and my heart.

12 years later it remains my favourite game of all time, almost uncontested... with some caveats.

Firstly, it's a Bethesda RPG and 13 years old. I don't expect it to run like a dream but it'd be nice if it was just a little bit more stable. Throughout the main story, I'd estimate it crashed at least once for every two hours of gameplay. That's not including the repeatable hard-crash I found in my save related to one of the achievements. It's not something I would complain about really, and you can tell the game to save when you do nearly anything that might might increase your odds of crashing (like loading a new area for instance). (keep in mind, this is the un-modded base game)

I expected the performance issues, in truth, I've never had great computers, and I've been looking for a reliable way to play Fallout NV for almost the last 12 years. What I didn't expect was to be left slightly let down by the voice acting and some of the character interactions. The vast majority of the voice acting in incredibly flat. There are certainly a good number of stand outs among the voice talent but Matthew Perry, for example, really phones it in. Yuri Lowenthal is all over this game, and really presents a ride range of performances. I think where it usually falls short is in the delivery. I mean I can't blame them. There's a metric ton of recorded dialogue, and the vast majority of players probably read the text box and skip over the voice acting, so who cares if the read is a little flat. Just something that stood out for me as an adult coming back to the game. I feel like here's where I would cite some examples of good VO in the game, but all that really comes to mind is ""Yes Man"" and the Yuri's performance as the guy who won the Nipton lottery. 

The character interaction gripe is more about how certain interaction weave together. There were several times when I would approach a character and a text box would give me choices that implied I had ""heard a rumour"" about this character, or gleaned some level of information I just don't ever remember hearing. Many groups of NPCs have one ""signature"" voice line they will simply repeat over and over again when you walk in close proximity to them. For example, the Fiends would often ask me if I ""like the sight of my own blood"", many times over the course of a single combat, and multiple times per enemy. There's also the infamous NCR quote, ""Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a Nuclear Winter"".

You may notice I still recommend the game. Fallout: New Vegas is the greatest game of all time, despite the nitpicks listed above. The natural story progression woven around different factions with conflicting interests makes for a compelling and different experience nearly every time I pick the game up. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about my most recent hardcore play through was that I very carefully progressed through the story to not lock out any ending until I was almost finished. This means most of my decisions were motivated by the achievements in game and not by the choices and options my character would have chosen. I highly discourage playing like this unless you are a broken person like myself. In which case I understand: You had no choice.

In my opinion, One of the games greatest strengths is how sprawling the map is. Very rarely will New Vegas cram you into sewer tunnels and force you surface in various cut-off metropolitan piles of rubble (I.E. Fallout 3. And 4 to some extent). there are a few notable exceptions to this but the Mojave wasteland feels so much less claustrophobic than Boston or Washington. It's the sprawling setting combined with the aforementioned sprawling story that gives this overall feeling of a world that's truly alive. A world where people all say the same canned one-liners as they wander aimlessly around, but I digress.

Overall I returned to the Mojave wasteland to find the best things about Fallout: New Vegas still hold up, my grievances with the game became slightly more nuanced, and unsurprisingly, there were more than a handful of undiscovered NPCS, weapons, and locations that I wasn't able to find on PS3 before my FPS went negative and I had to restart.

Life changing game. Highly recommended. I'll pick it up in another 12 years if I'm still kicking.",1704531838,1705299921,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

[i] [b] R.E.M. - Its The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine) [/b]

That's great, it starts with an earthquake,
Mojave shakes, and the old world's at stake,
Nipton's ablaze, and the Legion's on the rise,
Benny's on the run, and there's no compromise.

It's the end of the world as we know it,
But I feel fine.

Vegas Strip's a mess, neon signs are flickering,
Caps are the currency, but they're not trickling,
Mr. House's robots, Securitrons stand tall,
In the desert wasteland, where chaos calls.

It's the end of the world as we know it,
But I feel fine.

Veronica's got her power fist,
And Boone's sniping heads from his outpost list,
Ranger armor and a Pip-Boy too,
I've got quests to complete, and so much to do.

It's the end of the world as we know it,
But I feel fine.

Old World Blues, Dead Money, Honest Hearts in tow,
Lonesome Road's a journey where secrets will show,
With factions to choose, and decisions so tough,
In New Vegas, your fate's never enough.

It's the end of the world as we know it,
But I feel fine.

And in the Big MT, where mad scientists roam,
The Think Tank's quite nutty, but they're right at home,
With cyberdogs, stealth suits, and tech from the past,
You're in for a ride, it's a wild, wild blast!

It's the end of the world as we know it,
But I feel fine.

So pick your side, whether NCR or Legion,
Or go it alone with your own religion,
In the Mojave Wasteland, where choices are key,
It's a Fallout adventure, for you and me.

It's the end of the world as we know it,
But I feel fine.

Yes, it's the end of the world as we know it,
But in New Vegas, I feel fine. [/i]

[i] [b]Title: Arnie's New Vegas Adventure [/b]

[Scene: Arnold Schwarzenegger, dressed casually in a Fallout-themed t-shirt, sits in a dimly lit room surrounded by empty Nuka-Cola bottles and a massive TV screen displaying Fallout: New Vegas.]

Arnold: (With an enthusiastic grin) Ahh, ladies and gentlemen! It's time to dive into the wasteland once again! This time, it's not about Terminators or politicians, it's about surviving the Mojave Desert!

[Arnold grabs the controller and starts playing the game. The iconic ""Fallout"" theme music plays in the background.]

Arnold: (In his best Austrian accent) I'm ready to get my adventure started. In this game, I'm not the Governator; I'm the Mojaveator!

[Arnold's character, dressed as a Vault Dweller, emerges from Doc Mitchell's house into the wasteland.]

Arnold: (Excitedly) Look at this! I'm stepping out into the Mojave, and I've got my Pip-Boy ready to go! (Flexes his arm like a robot) Pip-Boy, activate! Hasta la vista, boredom!

[Arnold explores the wasteland, encountering various characters and creatures.]

Arnold: (Chuckling) Oh, look at this guy! (points to a friendly NCR soldier) He's more jacked than me! I bet he lifts Brahmin for fun!

[Arnold's character gets ambushed by a group of Cazadores.]

Arnold: (Fighting off the Cazadores) Get to the chopper! No, wait, I mean get away from the Cazadores! These bugs are tougher than the Predator!

[Arnold's character enters the New Vegas Strip for the first time.]

Arnold: (Amazed) Wow! The New Vegas Strip! It's like Las Vegas, but with more radiation and fewer showgirls. But that's okay; I'm here to party!

[Arnold's character tries his luck at a casino.]

Arnold: (Shouting) I'm all in, baby! This is like playing poker with the Terminator. He never bluffs!

[Arnold's character wins big at the casino.]

Arnold: (Celebrating) Yes! I'm on fire! I should open my own casino: ""Arnold's Lucky Vault."" Come for the gambling, stay for the bicep flexing!

[Arnold's character gets into a heated conversation with Mr. House.]

Arnold: (Mocking Mr. House) You think you can control New Vegas? You can't even control your own thermostat! I've got more muscle than your whole Securitron army!

[Arnold's character joins the Brotherhood of Steel.]

Arnold: (Wearing Power Armor) I feel like a walking tank! I'm the T-800 of the wasteland now, baby!

[Arnold's character confronts Benny.]

Arnold: (With a wicked grin) Benny, you made a big mistake crossing me! I'm going to terminate you with extreme prejudice!


[Arnold's character finally confronts the game's final boss, Legate Lanius.]

Arnold: (Facing Legate Lanius) You're a tough cookie, but you're no match for the Mojaveator! (Launches into an epic battle)

[After defeating Legate Lanius and completing the game, Arnold takes a deep breath.]

Arnold: (Satisfied) That was one hell of a ride! Fallout: New Vegas, you're fantastic! It's got everything: action, drama, and more radiation than you can shake a Geiger counter at!

[Arnold raises his Pip-Boy in the air triumphantly.]

Arnold: (Concluding) So, if you want a post-apocalyptic adventure that's as epic as my muscles, then get yourself a copy of Fallout: New Vegas. Remember, I'll be back... to play it again!

[Arnold takes a final sip of Nuka-Cola and flexes his biceps.]

Arnold: (With a wink) Hasta la vista, wasteland! [/i]

[b] In the Mojave sun, where the tumbleweeds play,
Fallout New Vegas, a wild-west melee.
With a pip-boy on my arm and a grin on my face,
I roam the wasteland, in this post-apocalyptic space.

From the Strip to the Primm's roller coaster ride,
I navigate chaos with a swaggering stride.
Caps in my pocket, and a trusty plasma gun,
In the Mojave, my friend, the real fun's just begun! [/b]",1694795224,1705210724,True,51,24,0.745309829711914063,0,True,False,False

Many quests do change game endings or other things, the story is a great thriller of revenge and regional politics turned into a last war, and god damn the companions are loveable.

One of my favorite games of all time with so many treasures and hidden things, every playthrough I find something new.

Definitely worth the $30 to buy the ultimate edition which I recommend as you will get more out of it that way. The base game does have a lot already but you'll miss out on content that offers more options to tackle the base game excluding the stuff offered in the DLC areas and quests. My only gripes are the RNG can feel a bit wonky and the heavy focus on moral ambiguity. I get that is a lifelike system and that's fine but it bothers me as it can narrow and/or end your approach. Depending on how you go about things, a lot of quests or even items can be either missed or outright unavailable to you. That is a problem for a completionist like myself as I like to experience everything in one run. I am aware I could do a new run and do things differently, but it is annoying none the less and still you can't get everything.

    Fallout 3 had already been released and with it the saga had been launched once again, now in 3D and with all the support of Bethesda to continue standing, so the next installment of this universe is launched, being the case of Fallout: New Vegas, a delivery developed by Obsidian, which despite the short development time and wreaking havoc on its launch, went down in history as an icon of Western RPGs.

    Released on October 19, 2010, Fallout: New Vegas is an open-world RPG with touches of a first- and third-person shooter set in the science fiction universe of Fallout, in which we take the role of a messenger from New Vegas. whose mysterious package is taken from him and after almost dying, he sets out to find those who tried to end his life.

[b] Below, a list of positive and negative points experienced during my time playing and free of spoilers (do not consider this as an absolute truth, but as what it is, a simple opinion) [/b]

[h3] What did I like? [/h3]

🟩 [b] History [/b] It has an absolutely wonderful development, considering abandoning the black and white between good and evil, and bringing it closer to a gray scale.
 
🟩 [b] Gameplay. [/b] Maybe not perfect, but it has a balance between action and roleplay that is very pleasant to intersperse depending on the situations you want to expose yourself to.

🟩 [b] Real importance of decisions [/b] one of the few games where our decisions will really mean a pronounced change, so you have to think about everything twice in advance.

🟩 [b] Music. [/b] Totally personal, but I consider many of the songs that were used for this title as memorable, even outside of their original objective.

[h3] What did I NOT like? [/h3]

🟥 [b] Performance. [/b] just like Fallout 3, presents a large number of bugs, glitches and errors (which exponentially increase their frequency in expansions)

🟥 [b] Aesthetics. [/b] just like Fallout 3, really disappointing, working based on the Creation Engine, both the modeling, textures and animations are notoriously crude and lazy, even for its time.

[h3] What should I take into account when playing? [/h3]

❕ [b] Recommended use of mods [/b] If the gameplay becomes unstable, the use of third-party mods is recommended to obtain good performance during Gameplay.

[h3] Personal opinion. [/h3]

New Vegas is my favourite game of all time. It means a lot to me. This was the game that cemented my love for video games as a whole. This was the first game that really forced me to actually think about the choices I was making and how my character's actions were influencing the world. This was the game that introduced me to the concept of grey morality.

I have a lot of fond memories of this game. A lot of nostalgia. It really is just a great game, and a lot of people have explained why that is better than I ever could. If you want a good video to sleep to, hbomberguy on youtube has a video essay about this game. It's a good watch.

Its also important to note that NV isn't perfect on its own, and a big reason why I love this game as much as I do is because of how much fun it is to mod it.

I'd never play pure vanilla FNV and I highly recommend you don't. The Viva New Vegas modlist is the definitive way to play the game in 2023. It's a lightweight, performance and bug-fix focused modlist maintained and curated by notable members of the modding community.",1590747703,1704864192,True,2,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

The best aspect of Fallout New Vegas is the level of writting quality and open world design, almost all of its side quests revolve around the main story which creates a very well build and believable world, can't say the same about Bethesda's fallout games.

Just like any fallout game, you're free to explore and go wherever you'd like, but generally speaking this time of freedom leads to an unorganized and poorly paced story.
In New Vegas, as soon as you drift away too far from the route to the main story, it blocks you with an ""organic difficulty"".
For instance, after leaving the begining area, you wouldn't be able to take any of the shortcuts to the main objective since they're overrun by extremely difficult enemies for beginner. 
It forces you to stay on the main route but you still have the freedom to try or come back more experienced.

It's gameplay and gunplay are obviously dated and stiff, yet it still manages to be enjoyable and satisfying , but I admit it's not perfect. If we could add Insurgency Sandstorm's Gunplay to New Vegas it would be incredible.

Unlike Fallout 4 it's an actual RPG ; you can play an evil playthrough ; when receiving a quest, you can complete it in different ways ; if you are poorly skilled in certain field to complete a quest, you are never blocked, you can find another path to complete the quest.

Which is why Fallout 4 is not an RPG, for most of its quests the only choices of completing it, is either following the linear path without any alternative way or just ignoring it. 
And the Fallout 4 highly forces you to complete it, in Fallout New Vegas never does it forces you to use a specific mechanic or to complete a quest unless it's the main story and you obviously have a lot more possible outcomes.

It genuiely impresses me how a game made in 2010 in only 18 months has way more depth whereas Fallout 4 probably had 5 or 7 years of development and yet it so mediocre in every aspects.

New Vegas' technical quality is obviously its worst aspect, it crashes a lot and by ""a lot"" I mean A LOT ! But given the fact it was given only 18 months to develop, I don't blame it on Obsidian... I blame it on Bethesda, like always.

22380,155635598,76561199223589299,0,1,2588,0,1034,1707430037,"I enjoy Fallout New Vegas about as much as Fallout 4. I know Fallout 4 isn't exactly the world's favorite Fallout, but the dialogue menus are actually good, the story I haven't gotten too heavily into but I can tell from the missions around it that the story is going to be decent, and I haven't encountered many bugs.

Summary:
+ Few bugs
+ Faction Armor is better
+ Perks/Skills are better than Fallout 4 Skill Tree
+ Dialogue System feels Immersive
+ Karma and Faction Perception is better than Affinity
+ Weapon Durability and Armor Durability feels Realistic
+ Full Roleplay, lets you pick teams/sides
+ Companion Commands are more in-depth
+ Companions feel more fleshed-out as characters (without FO4 Affinity Quests)
+ The quality/variety of ammo feels more immersive and realistic
+ The different forms of currency feels more immersive and realistic
+ Rads don't *just* limit your health, they also weaken you - more realistic
+ Weapons generally feel/sound better to use and have more noticeable trade-offs
+ Weapons feature a ""middle ground"" between being old-fashioned but still having clearly evolved since the atomic bomb, but not to the point of feeling Sci-Fi.
* No settlements
- Lack of Underarmor and Armor Pieces (like Arm/Leg armor pieces)
- Creating a character is disappointing for a 2010-ish game
- You can't customize areas designated for you like you can in Fallout 4's Home Plate
- Repairing guns in your inventory feels overpowered
- Accessing the appropriate workbenches can feel challenging coming from FO4

Review Disclaimer:
- I am a programmer!
  - I suck at making games so while my ideas may be kind-of okay, they can still be very far-fetched for game design. 
  - I've tried making games, and I'll stick to making text-based games like you'd see in DOS-era, thank you very much! 
  - I dabble in things like AI and game engines - despite my repeated failures in making my own of either, so I do genuinely know a little bit about the limits of Fallout's game engine as well as the limitations of AI models.


=== Descriptive Review ===
Bugs Found:
- I have encountered one random crash that mostly occurs when I load a save right after loading a save, but to be fair, this game is a little bit more dated than my PC, and it's reported as just being a hardware/software clash with the engine (which I rant about for EVER by the end of this review)
- I also encountered what *seems* to be a bug with the one nice lady in Primm wanting Radscorpion Glands in exchange for casseroles. I obtained the glands - both of the usual variety and of the ""Bark Scorpion"", and the game forces my character to say I have none. I checked the wiki and couldn't find the issue, so maybe it's something wrong on my part. My game IS unmodded.

Things I miss from Fallout 4:
- Settlements, or at least a way to customize a ""home base"" like Home Plate
- Mods being fully baked-in (I'm lazy when it comes to mod loaders)
- I am only 17 hours in, but I still have no power armor. I don't know if it's absent or if it's more mid-to-late-game, but either way, having power armor is a must
- Being able to repair weapons in my inventory feels a little overpowered to me. I can carry 12 shotguns, merge them around a bit, somehow wind up with better damage-per-second, and keep my mods?
- I miss things like the Weapons and Armor workbench from Fallout 4. I think being able to specifically craft mods is a better idea than just buying them, however I think the mods should probably be made without an actual ""workshop"" like in Fallout 4 - requiring all the gear to be in your inventory first.
- I prefer the Fallout 4 way of doing armor modification, having multiple tiers and having armor for your arms, legs, torso, head, etc. I also like the layering armor, having under-armor as well as over-armor, and being able to wear all sorts of other stuff.

Things I prefer in New Vegas over Fallout 4:
- Karma is far better than Companion Affinity! It feels more balanced and holds you more accountable
- The way different factions treat you is 100% better in New Vegas, letting you pick sides with the ""bad guys"" and really get into the fact it's role-playing.
- The Skills and Perks, along with how SPECIAL integrates with them, is far better. It provides more fine-grain control over what my character is good at, and lets me make changes to my characters' specialties more mid-game and requires far less research into skill trees.
- Dialogue in Fallout 4 is literally the worst, New Vegas (and I believe 3 as well) takes the cake.
- I almost want to say the bartering system is different in New Vegas. I 100% prefer the idea of having different faction currencies in New Vegas, but I almost wish factions would force you to use THEIR currency and you have to trade it around somewhere else, making it more ""realistic"" in how a post-apocalypse would work
- I prefer the Rads system in New Vegas, it doesn't limit my health, it just makes me easier to kill - which is kind-of how it should be. It makes me weaker in attacks as well as health, makes my overall character fail at stuff, and is pretty realistic.
- I significantly prefer the concept of weapon durability, different types of ammo, and mods in New Vegas over what Fallout 4 has. See above though, as I feel there are things missing from New Vegas as well.
- I like the weapon variety in New Vegas better
- I like the idea that companions refuse to wear armor of factions they do not approve of, which to me helps immersion. I haven't checked to see what happens if *I* wear the armor of factions others don't approve of, but I'd say if those factions don't approve of the armor and shoot at me, THAT is good immersion too!
- I like the idea of having companions in New Vegas that are less ""Here I am, here's my story, I'll shoot stuff"", and them actually being fully fleshed out characters that you almost have to use charisma to get to travel with you. They don't just offer and pester.
- Companions in general are better in New Vegas, I like the stories and characters so far with companions, and I like how they deal with commands and such. Further, I like how they don't have a direct affinity (seemingly), nor do they directly connect to karma, but they DO have likes and dislikes you should probably respect (as far as I can tell). It's not like they'll kill you for it, but they'll give you a piece of their mind

Additional Notes:
- Fallout 4 limits you to side with objectionably ""good guys"" without DLC, and even forces your hand with the end-game faction like the Institute. New Vegas, on the other hand, lets you literally join the Legion and Powder Gangers, two of the well-known bad guys without debate.
- I've noticed non-engine bugs being much more rare in New Vegas than Fallout 4
- I noticed the RPG aspects are FAR superior in New Vegas.
- I definitely prefer many parts of Fallout 4's immersion via armor and personalization aspects. 
  - I also feel Fallout 4's character creation is 100x better than New Vegas.
- Skills and Perks system in New Vegas is vastly superior to Fallout 4's Skills Tree, and the Karma and Faction Perspective systems (where you get Good/Bad Karma as well as factions liking/hating you) FAR FAR FAR surpasses the system used in Fallout 4, which uses companions to punish you, but has absolutely annoying effects with settlements where you can get killed over a bowl of Noodles.
- The immersion of the Karma is superior.
- The immersion of dialogue is superior.",1704821565,1704821565,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
One and 19 more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip
21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground

but to hell with it, I'll play devil's advocate.

TL:DR: It alright, not as good as I think many people believe it is.

Before I start, I want to say that New Vegas isn't an inherently bad game, there are things about it I absolutely love, but its absolutely overhyped and sold so many nostalgia goggles that the fucker selling them could buy a yacht. Also, before anyone even asks, my favorite RPG is KoA: Reckoning, there is no Bethesda fanboy here, thank you.

New Vegas is a game with *mostly* good writing plagued with standout poor decisions, a dated engine, and what I feel is an empty and incomplete setting. Gameplay for its time was better than 3 but it still has one issue I will bring up later.

Without Further ado; Lets start our review with the Courier himself:

[h1] A blank slate except not really [/h1]

New Vegas, as a whole, has some solid writing behind it and has concepts that I find generally interesting in a post-apocalyptic space. The Strip and Mr. House are interesting, the NCR is interesting, the Legion is... interesting but also boring except we'll talk about that later. The Courier is by far the most interesting out of everyone in my opinion. He (or she) is an enigma, someone who is only referred to by profession alone and is the catalyst for change in the plot of New Vegas. The ambiguity of the character truly allows you to make them who you want...
...unless you install Lonesome Road, where a backstory is forcefully shoved into your character, limiting aspects of that ""blank slate"" previously set.

This was a ""Jump the shark"" moment that felt way more forced than it needed to be. It takes away the charming enigma of the courier, and just causes weird plot inconsistencies (If the Divide was so pivotal to the NCR, how in the fuck does *nobody* in the NCR even recognize or refer to the courier, even vaguely? Unless Doc is just the greatest surgeon on the planet that just does not make much sense) that were best left never created.

[h1] RPG elements perhaps a little *too* open-ended [/h1]

Fallout is a game that is defined by the Skill-Check. It forces you to make compromises on what your character is, in order to make specific situations fare either better or worse for you. We all know speech is busted in this game but that is not something I wish to necessarily focus too hard onto for this review.

What I take issue with, is that you can build your character paradoxically to itself.
S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and Skills (of which skills compromise almost all of the skill checks) are completely separate from each other, which at first glance is completely fine. It opens up more options to the player and makes build flexibility. Unfortunately I think that there should have been some limiter on how far you can advance skills based on your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats.

Case in point: 1 Charisma 100 speech, while hilarious, makes zero sense unless you also put heavy points into Luck. You can be the unluckiest person in the wasteland, where every conversation with you is equal to an active hostage negotiation, and yet you can BS your way through everyone and everything. If New Vegas did not put such an emphasis on the RPG aspects then maybe I could let this slide, but this is a heavy RPG game and it just feels off to do something like this.

I know you can make the argument of ""people can learn and improve over time"", but it would make more sense with having to level your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. to improve skills even then. Whenever you practice something, you focus on improving the fundamentals (in this case, S.P.E.C.I.A.L.) first, then you move onto the more advanced stuff (skills) after you've grown comfortable with your level of understanding of said fundamentals. I would argue that this would make a better RPG system where both skills and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. genuinely matter, forcing you to compromise much more taxingly on combat over speech and vice-versa.

[h1] Objectively evil, nonsensical Faction [/h1]

I know, I know: ""They wanted to expand on the Legion but they ran out of time"".

Unfortunately, we are not talking about what they *wanted* to do, we are talking about what they are *in-game*, and the Legion is a faction so comically evil in their actions in the Mojave that they might as well have a monocle and a Dick-Dastardly-esque moustache. They enslave people, they burn cities to the ground, their ""Initiation"" involves slaughtering other tribes nearby. For a game that so heavily alludes to the ""Moral grey-area"", and that not one faction is simply ""the best"" for the mojave, these guys are as black-hearted as Jack Horner. 

Plus, its an extremely hard sell to compare savage, *legitimately misogynistic*, and extremely violent tribesmen following a flawed interpretation of ancient history to ""ya know, democracy can be convoluted sometimes"".

Unless you're an anarchist, this isnt a complicated choice.

[h1] About as interesting as the real Nevada [/h1]

The world just feels empty and souless outside of Freeside, The Strip, and a few areas with genuinely good side-quest stories. I like exploration and I like it when any game regardless of genre encourages it. New Vegas feels as though it does not encourage exploration for the most part. It likes to heavily imply ""go here this way"" many times, especially early on, and often punishes you for the mere thought of not going where it tells you to by making you fight high-level enemies. The amount of times I walked into a cave thinking ""Maybe there's something in here"" only for it to be maybe like 6-7 enemies and nothing else makes my soul feel indescribable pain. The strip itself is also kind of a let down, its a handful of large buildings and some smaller stuff tucked in there just a tad. If you told me that Reno from Fallout 2 would be a more interesting place than *Las-fucking-Vegas* I would think you'd need to be admitted to a psych ward.

[h1] A lot of tell, but very little show [/h1]

This is an issue that is more or less constant with Obsidian when it comes to non-isometric RPGs, they often have a good idea of scope and can write well for the most part, but they cannot do environmental storytelling to save their ass. Everything in NV is explained to you in long, excruciating detail. It may as well be a novel with a game on the side. It's hard to necessarily ""see"" what the characters talk about outside of a few specific instances and the world has very little impact by your actions outside of the ending slideshow. Learning about the world boils down to playing 20 questions with any named NPC and its fucking boring. What dialogue that doesnt just loop you back to the beginning options are essentially: ""positive response"", ""negative response"",  ""snarky jerk/funny haha response"", ""[Skill #] Skip quest step"".  Ironically, these are the same basic responses that Fallout 4's dialogue got so much flak over, but here its fine?

[h1] Was buggy, still is buggy [/h1]

Something something mods something something bugthesda.

Jokes aside, I'm not considering mods when talking about the game that the Developers themselves made, I got angry with Fallout 3's instability so I have to stay consistent. Unfortunately, New Vegas is every bit as buggy as 3 from what I have seen and can remember. I have been told its a massive improvement over when it first released, but they haven't been able to iron everything out and it still does show even 13 years later.

[h1] Final Words and Other Things [/h1]

I don't want this to come off as though I hate New Vegas. Its a fine game, worthy of being called an RPG even. There are characters I do like and factions I think are really good, but I don't see this as the ""Best RPG of all time"", not by a long shot. Other, newer games like BG3 and even indie titles like Undertale and Disco Elysium do what this game tries to do in terms of dynamic storytelling much better.

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
One and 19 more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip
21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

the quest design is awesome, the perks, traits and stat point system is superb: there are few games better than this one. it of course has its flaws, such as the occasional crash and the (slightly) dreaded entity load-unload glitch.

tbh new vegas is a niche & very silly game that floats on a legacy of memes & new players in 2024 probly wont get much out of fallout in general

however the ammo crafting/ammo types system is fun new fps games should take after it as well as let you complete the game as a faction-less anarchist (which this game does)

Probably the best fallout game on the market, and a prime example of superior story telling over what Bethesda has to offer, but also updating the game to a modern system that fallout 3 did bring the game up to date with, and given that it was Obsidian that made the original trilogy the passion shows through here, even though it's set in a desert setting my least favorite setting actually it still shines bright for me.  Even if you're from an older generation that grew up on the original fallout games which i respect for what they did to give us fallout 3 and probably the best modern fallout some would even say The best fallout NewVegas, i'd still say give this game a try, truly it's the story that shines through with this game, as well as a bit with the gameplay

Uranium ore's worth more than gold
Sold my Cad', I bought me a Jeep
I've got that bug and I can't sleep

With a Geiger counter in my hand
I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land
Uranium fever has done and got me down
Well, I had talk with the AEC
And they brought out some maps that looked good to me
And one showed me a spot that he said he knowed
So, I straddled my Jeep and headed down the road
I reckon I drove about 100 miles
Down a bumpy road out through the wilds
When all of sudden I bounced to a stop
At the foot of a mountain, didn't have no top
Uranium fever has done and got me down
Uranium fever it's spreadin' all around
With a Geiger counter in my hand
I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land
Uranium fever has done and got me down
Well, I took my Geiger and I started to climb
Right up to the top where I thought I'd find
A hunk of rock that would make it click
Just like I'd read about Vernon Pick
On the second day, I made the top
And I'm tellin' you, Steve, I was ready to stop
The only clickin' that I heard that day
Was the bones in my back that had gone astray
Uranium fever has done and got me down
Uranium fever is spreadin' all around
With a Geiger counter in my hand
I'm a-goin' out to stake me some government land

Into some unknown spot where nobody's been
You reach the spot where your fortune lies
You find it's been staked by 17 other guys

That bug's done caught me and I've been bit

However, the shining beacon of this holy creation is the story. The story is not only beautifully crafted, with branching paths and true player freedom, but it also doesn't take itself too seriously. One moment I'm contemplating the true merit of being human in an apocalypse... then the next, and Elvis wannabe gives me his cyborg dog to go get brain surgery. S tier writing right there. I genuinely feel that this game should be studied as the pinnacle of RPG writing and game making. It's a shame that Bethesda didn't give this game the true credit it deserved and that many people think it is just a ripoff of Fallout 3. But if you compare the two, it is night and day. Obsidian has a much greater knack for writing and a better grasp on the lore. It amazes me that a game like this can be made in just 18 months. But by God did they knock it out of the water. Many people wish for a Fallout New Vegas 2. But it isn't necessary. What they're really craving is for Bethesda to take their head out of their ass and create a game that has the fraction of love, care, and detail as this one. 
I legitimately think about this game throughout my day. I take the game out to dinner, maybe a walk in the park. One time I took the game to the roller rink and I fell down.

new  vegas has its flaws,its a buggy mess but its a special gem .

modded and not modded ,its one of the few games i can immerse myself in and even after 10 years of playing the game i still find new stuff i never knew about 

if you want an open world apocalyptic shooter i will say get fallout 4, if anything that game does gunplay and base building perfect while lacking immersion

-Fascinating and dynamic open world
-Extremely satisfying combat / crafting systems
-Engaging story with many interesting locations, people, and missions
-Cool music 
-Many useful and fun perks
-The ability to have up to 2 companions to act as body guards/ pack mules for your extra weapons/ supplies.
-Guaranteed fun!

Negatives about this game for me are: 
-Every choice matters, which is good, but there are so many possible outcomes that I end up overthinking many choices because doing a mission for one side may anger or at least slightly upset another side. There is a balance of who you are friends with and once you are against certain sides they send groups to ambush you, sometimes constantly, if you are a big enough enemy.
-The natural enemies such as Deathclaws and Cazadors are fun but there are a lot of them, and many enemies are OP. If you want a laid back type of game you will find yourself having to fight often.

Overall this game is a 9/10 for me!

After being shot in the head and left for dead, a courier sets out across the Mojave desert on the trail of their attempted killer. Once in New Vegas, their actions decide which of three factions (or themself) will win the Second Battle of Hoover Dam. In the process, they determine the fate of a whole host of every other faction and major character in the region.

There are a few things about New Vegas that might turn people off it. The looks. The gunplay. Inventory-management-Bethesda-game-vibes. A lot of slow walking until you've found location markers. Late-game quests encouraging a lot of fast travel. The crashes. Interiors that are repetitive to the point of being confusing to navigate. All of these are real problems. If you're the kind of person who needs these aspects to be great, then F:NV won't be for you.

But none of these problems should ruin the game for you. They're all pretty manageable. Just save a lot and enjoy the vibe. You'll get through it. I hear there are great mods for all of these.

The good aspects of New Vegas are exceptional and more than make up for the unsatisfying. They are the atmosphere, the open-ended narrative structure, the setting and the characters.

The atmosphere is masterfully created through soundscapes. The creatures and guns sound fine, but there are some exceptionally lonely non-music soundscapes that turn up when you turn your radio off. Unparalleled. 

The open-ended narrative structure of New Vegas is a masterpiece of art and engineering. It kind of boggles my mind that anyone could even make this. You can pick up quests any part of the way through and finish them in many different ways. The game never stops you from killing an important character. And this works at the micro- and macro- level. You can not just do individual quests in many ways, you can choose completely different main quests, which can open up or lock off other quests. You can kill Caesar without being asked and the game keeps going. In one of my play-throughs the president of the main faction got assassinated off stage. Next play-thorugh, I was in that faction's good books and I saved him from assassination. It's hard to put into words how reactive New Vegas is, but it really does feel like you can tackle any problem in a huge number of ways, and the game takes that into account.

What makes the setting great? It's not the visuals but the coherence and groundedness of it all. Characters mention locations, and things that have happened at them. And you can go and see those places for yourself. Everywhere you go (outside of Caesar's legion, which in my view having not played for them yet is a little less developed), you can see where people get their food and what they do for a living and so on. The battle lines make sense. It hangs together.

And the characters are all thoroughly solid. There are some standouts like Mr House, Joshua Graham/The Burned Man, No-Bark, Tabitha, and most of your companions (I love angry Boone). Like the setting, the important characters feel deeply realised, like a lot of thought has been put into how they became who they are and what they want.

All in all I thoroughly recommend New Vegas. An exceptional game. One of the classics.",1704234334,1704234334,True,1,0,0.503068506717681885,0,True,False,False

Leaving this review after seeing Starfield got obliterated for sticking with Creation Engine, and this is a shining example of the single best game made in Creation by a long shot, carried by dialogues and great missions alone.

You have in-depth and intriguing sociopolitical commentary with all the factions of the world, you have well thought out personal story of a cast of characters with solid motivation and valid ideologies. All the missions and locations shared complex interconnecting narrative and world building, where all major events and decisions in the past of the world has an effect on physical and psychological outcome on a location. 

They built this in a short time of 8 months. They built the best western ARPG in a cave with a box of scraps.

This game sucks, bottom line is the base game is missing content, your character is worthless to the the entire game, the factions are just Pepsi vs Coke, and the ending is as rewarding as Mass Effect 3's--none of your choices matter and it's basically choose your Instagram Filter and Voiceover(s).

I wrote my first review after playing ten hours of the game, eight of which was spent trying to get it to work because it kept crashing.
The response of the overly-rabid fanbase was that I had not ""played the game"" and therefore my opinion was invalid.

Well guess what? I played your crappy game, forty hours of my total playtime was spent trying to fix the damn thing too.
I played this entire crappy game, and I did all the crappy missions either on PC or 360--because apparently consoles are the master race to play Fallout: New Vegas on.

This game sucks. It's incredibly empty of enemies even on very hard, there's zero interaction between NPCs unless you install Mods, 90% of the game is difficult to pass without exploiting the game or yourself so you're forced to meet the two game's factions (which I could never give a shit about (Pepsi VS Coke IMO)), and at no point do they explain who your character was prior to the game or why you should give a crap about them--unless you buy the DLC. Oh how we don't make fun of Todd Howard for making you fools buy the game twice.

Fans say you should make your own story. If that's the case how does the DLC fit for that shitfest geniuses? Your entire backstory is there for you--but only if you're willing to pay for it?! What kind of EA Paywall/Assassin's Creed Brotherhood bullshit is this? Why am I being told to make my own backstory and character when one season pass later I can learn it at my own leisure for the low price of $60--the same price of Skyrim in 2011--that will tell you your character's backstory as part of the main game?

The only enjoyment I got out of the base game was when I was finally done with the last quest and got the sweet satisfaction of killing every character in every town. I didn't use godmode, or kill all, no I didn't use console commands until the DLC, which I will talk about later. I used every gun, weapon, and bullet in my arsenal to murder everyone. I even installed mods so I could kill everyone. Base game factions are dog crap, no memorable Base Game NPCs, let's move onto the DLC.

Honest Hearts: The worst, don't even buy it.
Dead Money: My favorite DLC, only part of the game I enjoyed, so much story and detail. Super sad I can't revisit it without console commands and it tried to force me to Sophie's Choice at the end for things I could just tgm for.
Old World Blues: Boring, Dr. Venture was awesome but I couldn't stand that DLC. Everyone talked constantly, it's like the one part of the game where everyone doesn't play Mime Simulator and they overdid it.
Lonesome Road: Biggest letdown in history. You have three fucking DLC's two of them sucking the mightiest nut out of the third one's dick, hyping it up to be the second coming of christ. Then you play it and it's a straight walk while some robot and an asshole with a gas mask talk your ear off the whole time about shit that I couldn't care less about BECAUSE I MADE MY OWN STORY LIKE NOSTALGIC IDIOTS SAY YOU SHOULD. 
Actually, that's a lie; I liked the Robot, it repaired my gun for me once. All of this just so I could pump five rounds into Baine's face and kill a horde while nuking as many people as I could in the Mojave. What a thrill, five VATS shots and a dialog box, really glad you all told me ""play lonesome road"" when I said the game was recycled Fallout 3 assets without the courtesy of giving you the main character.

Mods:

Mods are honestly the only reason I played this hunk of garbage on PC. Aside from the fact I NEEDED them in order for the game to work--because why make a game that can work--Mods helped remind me that individuals are better at making content than Obsidian. After installing the three mods that helped the game not crash (as much) I finally installd a few to help make the game, you know, fun.

TL;DR the base game is garbage, the DLC is dumb, the mods are great because Obsidian didn't have the opportunity to fuck those up.
Don't play this game UNLESS you're playing Fallout 3 with the Tale of Two Wastelands mod, otherwise you're just some asshole passing through with a past that's hidden behind a paywall. You idiots need to stop fetishizing games just because they are in the desert and let you play wearing a cowboy hat. Cowboy hats do not a good game make.

1/5 - I really wanted to like this game, but same as in real life, I don't enjoy steaming piles of crap. The setting is in one of the most interesting places in the Fallout Universe and somehow Obsidian found a way to make it boring! I would only recommend the game if it's included in a bundle, the only reason I own it is because the fallout bundle doesn't let you line-item void this game from your purchase. I'd honestly pay steam to remove it from my library, but thankfully that's free.",1499215454,1704181965,False,14,6,0.558430254459381104,40,True,False,False

Don't really wanna spoil much in terms of your choices since I think its better to go blind, but this game allows for a character build that you really have to commit over time, which I personally like, give's the whole ""role playing"" of the Fallout series some actual weight instead of just being a generic shooter that just so happens to be set in an apocalypse, the moral choices in regards to the factions really make you think at times, which I'm surprised ended up being so effective, one thing I rarely feel in games is immersion, and New Vegas knocks it out of the park with it's world building, the endings are also really satisfying, actually reflecting the choices you made on the journey.

By my wording it would seem the game is perfect, but I do have some red flags that I'm really guessing might turn away some people, the technical issues of this game are just ridiculous at times, constant crashing, corrupted save files, broken missions, broken AI, constant freezing at loading screens, unstable frame rate, overall jittery movement, and many many bugs. I had to deal with so many issues in my play trough and almost lost all my progress to a corrupted save file because of the crashing, but I personally think it is kinda worth it to endure it just to platy this game, it is that good, just a little warning flag to people who might not know the state of this game, aside from that, just fantastic, def my fav open world game I've played.

If you can find it at a good price, it's worth the investment, and I don't regret my purchase since I paid $2.49. However, in my opinion, this game is massively overrated; it's known as one of the better RPGs. I got it for my winter break from the last semester to pass the time. I encountered around 100 crashes or so, and my game would frequently stutter during combat, despite having an Intel i9 and a practically brand-new system. It would crash out of the game every 45 minutes to an hour during a play session.

I have 60 hours of in-game time, according to Fallout, but according to Steam, it's 80 hours. This discrepancy is due to all the times I crashed and rebooted the game, wasting a significant amount of time—essentially, an entire day of my life waiting for this game to load. Seriously, avoiding it will save you a day of your life. If you're desperate enough, either watch a YouTube playthrough of this game. the gameplay was mediocre; I wasn't impressed. I thought I would use V.A.T.S. more, but my character build made it frustrating. You walked around as slow as dirt, and exploring became boring. I got to the point where I would fast travel and be done with it. In other games, I don't like fast travel, just not in this game; it came in real handy because you're slow as molasses, and there were some quests that would make you think, which was good. I'm not that good at those sorts of things, but I respect it, though it got to the point where it was a bit rage-inducing.

Again, the branching paths and the ability to create your own story were interesting, especially considering when this came out, it was difficult to do that back then, and still, many game studios don't allow you to create your own story. This game is supposed to be better regarding crashes now, but I can't imagine playing any other Fallout game, as this was my first and only Fallout game I will ever play because I know these games get worse from here.",1704109066,1704109269,False,0,0,0.456431567668914795,0,True,False,False

This review based on my multiple playthrough spanning from Vanilla (unmodded) game to bug-fixed and modded game. My review based on my own opinion without reinforcement of external party (community, other player etc.). However my review address the vanilla experience since it's what most player going to get, unless stated below.
[hr][/hr]

Fallout New Vegas. What happen when you brought Fallout 2 (expanded) into 3D space which offers countless replayability and Role playing that beloved by its Fanbase. The Vanilla experience is kind of okay but once you learn modding on this game, it offer limitless possibility of enjoyment of Western Role Playing genre.

[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]
Just like its predecessor Fallout 3, New Vegas offer real time combat and VATS mode that helps you aiming limbs of your enemy. On this installment the combat more varied and every build like melee, unarmed, heavy weapons, energy weapons are equal in term of balancing, you can make them overpowered too if you can build your character right on their respective disciplinary focus. Unarmed and Melee build kind of close to Fallout 2 in term of its overpowered-ness once you get proper perks and build.

Perhaps due to several original Interplay staffs, the writing on this game is superior compared to Fallout 3 although the trade off is the world-visual storytelling that excels in Fallout 3 is less prominent in New Vegas.

New to this game is Faction Rep which more or less ""it is works"", if only it can be expanded further (but as we know the development time is pretty tight on this game).

DT and DR is back on this game instead of only relying Damage Resistance in Fallout 3. In my opinion using DT and DR is make more sense like in classic Fallout considering ""Armor"" can be divided into clothings and armors which have its own level of protection.

Ammo type is back from classic Fallouts. This mechanics brings better variety of combat as you're more likely using AP ammo on thick-skinned creatures or heavily armored enemies to punch through its armor's DT instead of using your standard ammo. Surplus is great choice if you want to get cheap ammos, (some types) have better armor penetration, though the trade off is your weapon would wear faster due to lower grade of its quality.

[h2]Storyline/Writing:[/h2]
I like how an afterthought character could shape the whole New Vegas thematic to full circle. A History, to let go and begin again (the past and future).

Through memes, time, and anything else perhaps everyone already know the plot.
You're Mailman who ordered to bring a special package into the heart of New Vegas, then suddenly you're hijacked mid-way and then the rest is there.

This game has lots reference to Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 considering New Vegas also take place closer to West Coast, even you can find some characters from Fallout 2 in here.

Side quests are fun too and varied though if you're rushing the game, you would probably miss lots of unmarked quest that really hidden gem of this game.

Dialogue choice is more diverse and skill checks is more prominent compared to Fallout 3.

for DLCs, my opinion such as below:
- Dead Money feels intimidating to newcomer because you're stripped on the start of DLC gameplay, navigating villa can be overwhelming if it's your first time. Once you understand and familiar with the DLC you're going to play this one breeze. Also decapitate those Ghost people. The writing and backstory is between okay and decent, but the most sought after of this DLC is the gold bars at the end of DLC, make your choice!

- Old World Blue, this one probably the [i]hardest[/i] DLC because there is an oversight by the developer that force the spawned NPC to be same level as you in Vanilla. The enemies can be bullet sponge though you can dispose them easily if you have snipers/Stealth crit kill. You can play this game real fast (heck on my latest playthrough I accidentally finished it under 3 hour) or more slower to explore Big MT.

- Honest Heart, bit of weak compared to the rest of storyline DLC. However this DLC visit some backstory of the lore in New Vegas and expands the existing one that also complement for the final DLC. Zion park feel fresh (no pun intended) compared to other DLC world map.

- Lonesome Road, decent DLC that have excellent character. Though I'd rather take this DLC as the last one to play because I felt it is more fitting for being the last (in timeline, and more info resource from previouses DLCs).

[h2]Sound Design:[/h2]
Hmm, sound design is not bad that bad yet also not great.

[h2]Graphics Design:[/h2]
Graphics is similar to Fallout 3 though on this game you have Piss filter on because it's desert. Maxed graphics level felt decent for move but if you want to have better graphics, use mods that remove that tinted filter, better weather and nice Reshade presets (for a note do not use ENB unless your graphics is powerful and it's not 2013 too).

[h2]Control Design:[/h2]
Same as Fallout 3, sometimes when you're doing movement you may be bugged. Menu navigation can be improved with mods.

[h2]Difficulty:[/h2]
Kind of forgot vanilla difficulty but if you want to stay reasonable, use Normal difficulty. Higher difficulty only affect DMG taken from NPC and dealt from Player. On Hardcore Mode difficulty does not change that much only you have added stats like human Needs (Hunger, Water, and Sleep) and Added weight for ammos.

[h2]Overall:[/h2]
Since this game also byproduct of its era and buggy Gamebyro game engine (carried from Fallout 3), this game can be buggy without bug fixes and script addons.

For that, I would rate this game 8/10 though if you want to mod it, this game easily have same similar level of enjoyment like modded Skyrim.

[h2]Personal Note:[/h2]
For a starter, You may want to use Viva New Vegas guide up to bug fixes for pure vanilla experience. then if you want first taste of modded game, try Viva New Vegas Extended+ guide.

If you want to enjoy Fallout New Vegas just as intended by one of the designer (Joshua E Sawyer) try JSawyer tweak-type mods to alter your gameplay. While some people consider this tweak can be crude in term of balancing, I think the re-balance that have been done by JESawyer is make sense as it forces you to become more resourceful on items, planning ahead to move, and use every features from New Vegas offer (eg. Mailboxes, Campfire). I recommend to use JSUE as it does not alter dramatically from the original tweak mod vision.",1704077877,1704077877,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It manages to simultaneously capture the feel of Fallout 3 whilst also maintaining an older, RPG style to it. No decision in Fallout: New Vegas is easy, and players are habitually asked to make genuinely tough and challenging decisions.

Note, however, the game's propensity to crash often. It's thirteen years old as I write, and so this is to be expected. However, the game makes it worth it. Even if you must quicksave frequently to prevent losing progress, you do get a game of this calibre, and only a game such as this would make frequent crashes worth it.",1704049261,1704049261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are so many versions of the player you can create and so many routes to go throughout the game. I've played through this game at LEAST 5 times at this point and it never gets old for me. The only issues I have to hark on are the obvious crashes you'll experience from time to time. Make sure you're saving every so often in case it happens to you. I've heard of mods that help with that but I've never bothered with them. It honestly isn't enough of a problem to have to searching for them just a bit annoying.

The feeling of tangible progress, the detail put into all the NPCs, how obsidian somehow managed to make a very good open world experience that is relatively similar to the Bethesda ones (World design, art direction, etc.), and of course the writing and role playing options are absolutely god tier.

There are flaws to the base game, however. The game-play has aged somewhat, but it's more fun than Fallout 3 and almost as good as Fallout 4. The game can also be extremely glitchy, which is my main issue with it.

Go to bottom left of screen click the windows sign, click settings, click system, click about, click advanced system settings and there will be a pop up, click settings on the performance part and a second pop up will show, then click on advanced and finally click on change under virtual memory(It just changes the paging file size that acts like pseudo RAM) and set it to a pretty high number(It's in MB so multiply by a thousand for GB), this worked for me but I have no Idea if it'll work for everyone.

As to why it might work, my best guess has to do with F:NV's memory leak issue, since you are adding pseudo RAM I'm guessing it essentially acts like putting a bucket under a leak, not really fixing the problem but delaying it for a long time, longer than you're using it.",1620607595,1703830705,True,0,0,0.421364158391952515,0,True,False,False

Fallout 4 has some but i find things to be too upbeat in general to feel like a real apocalypse.

Frankly i can't recommend this game enough. I own three copies of it on various platforms and am happy to have started replaying the game yet again. I started a new playthrough a few weeks ago and i'm loving my time. Despite having several hundred hours on my xbox, and another 100+ here, i can confidently say i'm still loving this game more then 13 years after it was released. While it certainly misses some features of newer and more modern games, it's still one of my favorite narrative experiences and i can't resist playing the game again at least once a year. At only 20 dollars for the game and all it's dlc on steam, it's a downright steal.

After that I played trough fallout 1 and 2, then extensively reading the wiki for hours digging for lore, then finally everything opened up to me as I started understanding the things happening within the game. my third playtrough was the best run I had out of the three since I can immerse myself in the world and realize the consequences of the things I chose to do.
Still even after all of that I couldnt get myself to enjoy dead money after 2 times playing. it soured my mood every time I played it. I can go on but that would take too long
I can see why people would like the game but its not a perfect game people would tell you into believing. Play without too much expectation.",1701772313,1703675062,True,0,0,0.458606302738189697,2,True,False,False

Fallout New Vegas is a game I've been told is worthwhile, considering I've played the two games worth playing, Dishonered and Metal Gear Rising, I knew it was up to me to determine whether or not this was an accurate statement. After thorough analysis I have come to the conclusion Fallout New Vegas is in fact one of the best RPG's ever made. There are plenty of places that can tell you this information however I will tell you about the evil publisher of this game.

Bethesda are a game studio and subsidiary to parent company that they split off from Zenimax Media, these companies have done a number of poopoo things, such as sell cosmetics in a single player rpg for 5 dollars, try to sell community made mods for monetary gain and resell the same game a dozen times. Needless to say I am shocked anyone buys games from these heathens but that's not all, they also out trans employees and then fire them while holding their healthcare hostage, they release horribly designed games that are shown up by decade old games they published (Yeah New Vegas) and consistently under perform while demanding players to tolerate their garbage business practices.

It is for these reasons I do not support buying this game through the digital store front, buy a copy from a third party or other means of acquisition that are legal and I am unaware of that do not involve this deplorable company that also didn't pay Oblivion who delivered us one of the greatest games of all time their bonuses because they missed 1 metacritic point score after giving them a shit deadline and budget to pump out a game with.

There is a reason why this game is still played 13 years after release. Bethesda could only wish for a game like this, and after the blunder that was Starfield, they likely will never come close to this.

This is the only modern Fallout in which properly expresses the story and atmosphere that Fallout 1 and 2 were originally going for and that's only due to the fact this game was written by the writers from the originals.
This game is an absolute masterpiece in story writing, and yet the engine and game-play are extremely terrible and outdated due to Bethesda forcing the developers to use their shitty engine. If you're okay with the shit engine, performance issues, and outdated mechanics, then that's okay. If you do mind, there are plenty of mods to do what Bethesda should've done themselves anyways and can greatly enhance your experience and make the game what I am sure the original developers wanted.

Approaching 'Fallout New Vegas' years after its release, I was met with a clash between my expectations, built by its strong reputation, and the reality of dated game mechanics.

[b][u]Pro:[/u][/b]
+ ...

[b][u]Contra:[/u][/b]
- Gameplay feels clumsy and outdated, not living up to modern gaming standards.
- Disappointment stems not from the game's content or story, but from its obsolete mechanics.
- The experience is marred by the struggle to adapt to the game's aging systems.

[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]
While 'Fallout New Vegas' has a celebrated status in gaming history, playing it for the first time 12 years after its release left me feeling let down. The game, sadly, feels [u]BAD[/u] due to its outdated mechanics, overshadowing its otherwise intriguing aspects. A remake might one day revive its magic, but for now, it's a challenge to enjoy in its original form.",1666027769,1703418487,False,2,0,0.397788733243942261,0,True,False,False

I've had a long time to appreciate New Vegas. Like many great works, it's quality only becomes more apparent with time. This could be the best writing in the industry.

The community is still debating the ethics of the factions and their power struggle. It's not hyperbole to say that NV has enriched its audience and forces them to expand their perspective the more they consider it.

One of the characters in this game is religious, yet is so well written he's developed a reputation for converting nonbelievers into Christians, IRL. Torn in quite a literal way between the old and new testament, between fire within, the fire around, and the waters of forgiveness.

Another would otherwise be a typical fascist dictator, yet presents his case so earnestly and with such justification that it takes some serious minded reading to find its flaws. Yet even at the end, it would make perfect sense for his knowledge of Hegelian dialectics to be skewed given his background.

Another is a man drowning in perspective, having traveled and seen too much with such contradiction he can't form the through-line that ties it all together. His passing and goings are spoken of through the whispers of others long before you meet him. His enigma is a shadow cast on a long and lonesome road.

Another is a ghost of the old world, eyes set forward  to such a lofty horizon that he doesn't care to see who lies beneath it. I'm telling you, hearing his ""Democracy"" line for the first time had me staring out my own window for a good while before I sat back down. Prepare to have your assumptions challenged.


Any issues over game crashes and buggy quests are frankly trivial. The game is as ugly as it needs to be for the setting. On sale it costs less than a sandwich.

Pros:
-The combat is incredible, almost every weapon feels great to use, guns and energy weapons have great sound design, you can feel the weight of your attacks with melee and unarmed. 
-The setting is incredible, the mojave wasteland is full of interesting places and characters to interact with. Just in Vegas alone you can finish a playthrough and still find new stuff in your next one.
-The interactions are top notch, characters react to things that have happened in the past. They know who you are and what you have done in your playthrough. There's always new lines of dialogue to find in the game depending on the way you approach a quest.

Cons:
-I can only think of one, but it's a really big one: the compatibility. If you run fallout new vegas right after you buy it, it's very likely to crash after a few minutes of gameplay. The game isn't very compatible with newer operating systems and it can be very annoying to lose 15-20 minutes of progress because the game crashed and you didn't save. If you plan on playing vanilla, SAVE OFTEN. I started playing this game a long time ago and I never finished it because the crashes were really bad. It wasn't until last year when I decided to give the game another chance and now I love it. On the other hand, if you want the crashes to stop or at least be minimal, mods are the way to go. I personally run Viva New Vegas, it's a modlist you can download (almost) automatically with a sotware called Wabbajack. The site is super friendly and it guides you through the installation step by step. You can even disable some mods if you don't want all of them when you're done.",1703201984,1703201984,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

It's considered a beloved (if flawed and janky) classic/masterpiece for a reason. Similar to an amazing Granddad - it's joints are stiff, it's not going to win any prizes for good-looks, and sometimes you really feel how outdated some aspects of it are. However, all that being said; it has some amazing stories, filled with truly memorable characters and moments. It's charm is undeniable and the world of FNV is one I wholeheartedly recommend exploring. I would urge you to spend a bit of time (depending on your familiarity/competence with modding...Setting things up could take you 30mins or a few hours, as you may - as I did, need to watch some tutorials etc. to get everything set up correctly, or simply to identify what mods you would like). Installing a few mods, at the very least some quality of life/performance based ones! It's honestly very simple once you understand/get over the fear of extracting files etc. but the Vortex mod manager will help a tonne! (There are some great tutorials out there). To conclude, this game is a must for any lover of RPGs (True RPGs, not shallow adventure-based games with RPG mechanics slapped on...looking at you Bethesda, but now is not the time to vent my perpetual frustration regarding THAT company). I love this game, not only for being a truly incredible journey, but also for keeping me occupied during a very difficult time in my life. From a far, FNV may look old, unattractive and stiff (It did when it came out over a decade ago tbf haha), but I promise, by the time you catch your first glimpse of the glowing city...of New Vegas, you will already be entangled in a beautiful Obsidian web. Unable to free yourself from it's embrace and unable to find a reason why you would want to. What message will you bring forth to the Mojave and what will you leave in your wake? Play it again...Johnny...Guitar <3",1703087709,1703087709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is rich and fulfilling, with nearly every minute decision you make affecting how the plot plays out. The map is rather large, with many different landmarks scattered around the Mojave Desert that contribute to the lore and story behind the world. Not to mention the NPC interactions which are all almost perfectly done, with every new character you come across having a unique and creative backstory that impacts how you interact with them. And for 10 dollars, and 2 dollars on sale, this game is worth every single penny. I'm writing this having only played this Fallout game, and I am planning to purchase Fallout 3 and 4 later this year.

Graphically sure its no Starfield but as we all should know ""looks aren't everything""  . It's not totally hideous it just shows its age . The characters and story  other than being shot in the head more than make up for it. A modicum of actual role playing goes so far . Much better than the chosen one dragon born super power starfield powers crap . Yhe NCR and Ceaser  are way better than the minute men or the stupid maked no sense lets save synths by blowing up the institute railroad will or could ever be .  The reveals are much better . The few plot twist are good and much less predictable then Oblivion or Skyrim .          ...    This game has actual edge .  It is the LAST Bethesda game to have anything even approximating mature content .     Everything after has been rated G in comparison .  The fact that the slot machines actually work and luck and gambling can really affect your early game is just wonderful .  No other Bethesda game especially Crap field  has such depth tho the companions not to mention the likeability .  Elderscroll games have yet fo have even one memorable companion . I can't name one .   ..The choices in this game are the best and most far reaching of any title in the Fall out universe .  The voice acting especially of Mr. House and Cassidy are very well done and believable.  The fun and the balance of combat is very good and sniping and stealth seemed just right for me . All the giant abandoned buildings and sites made sense and had purpose and you find more than just another sword or pipe pistol your just gonna drop or sell .   .. The bad guys in this world just really need a good killin . Whereas is in copy field I just can't care about the starborn or what they want or what they are doing .  Same for the thieves guild or the assassins  etc. etc .  I would just as well see them succeed at what the hell ever their lame little meaningless goals are . Mr. New Vegas is great way better than lame ole Travis .  Bethesda got rid of or dumbed down all the things that make this game great or just simply never understood them or just got lucky . Either way this game works ""it just works "" .  Too bad about the mods or the lack there of though .

I want to say it's like Skyrim or Oblivion or even the other Fallouts, but it's not really. It's in a league of its own. The story is brutally deadpan and the choices you have to make are usually neutrally chaotic. It really just pulls you in and you find yourself caring for these digital people and you don't even know why. On the flip side, when you meet your enemies (who you will choose), you will hate them to the CORE! There is a lot of side questability to this game. You really don't have to follow any sort of linear progression, short of just GETTING to Vegas. Although if you want to brave the north right away and think you can tango with some death crawlers, there really is no linear anything to the opening of the map. Bottom line, I love this game. It will suck you in, immerse you and not let go. It's playable multiple times from the beginning especially if you want to take a different path. You want to be a psycho killer or do you want to be the savior of the waste? Maybe you just want to be Jimmy Neutral, or a big mix of all. It's all up to you. Enjoy.

This is my game experience so far. I have had three characters in this game at time of writing and halfway through old world blues.My first character was my first time playing through the game with so much wonder and awe hit me but 10 hours in whenever i tried to boot up my character i got stuck in a endless loading screen which i had to turn off my computer to escape (alt tab didn't work) and then i didn't play it for another 5 months. When i caught covid and couldn't find any good games to play again i decided to try it again and it was 25 hours that play through i think, I did the Mr house story line and i feel as if i only played again 2 or 3 hours of content from the first play through (which is amazing) and had a lot of fun (i won't mention my current play through until its done unless i forget)

Okay so here is reasons for you not to play

 • Very buggy and can be very unstable with sometimes your saves not working and losing progress (can be fixed with mods)
 • Bad gun play (outside of its auto targeting system) and enemy ai 
 • Boring colour scheme (so little green so much orange and bad face models could hurt immersion if you can't deal with bad graphics  
 • Alot of the places you see on the map you can't actually go (mountains that are you cannot traverse) 
 • Bad face models could hurt immersion if you can't deal with bad graphics 

Reasons to play
 • Brilliant story in which you can side with a billionaire from before the bombs fell who wants to help restore Vegas to its former glory, the new Californian republic a attempt on rebuilding america and Caesars legion the new Rome who like to do slavery sexism and war crimes and are just evil in general but you can still join them 
 • You like branching quest lines and amazing world building 
 • So many perks to help you build the perfect character multiple paythroughs may be required though to make a truly great character
 • Immersive world building and amazing characters 
• Great soundtrack 
• A lot of memorable moments 

To end the review great game definitely overrated but still a amazing game and if there were no bugs it would be around a must play nine out of ten but because it has those issues i sadly have to give seven but if you like rpgs and immersive worlds and don't mind a lot of bugs and crashes get it",1702702259,1702702259,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Created in a relatively short development cycle and built on an engine that, at the time, was less than ideal, this game overcame significant challenges to become a beloved classic.

During its creation, the game faced hurdles due to the limitations of the engine it was built upon. The engine, while serviceable, presented numerous technical issues and constraints that the development team had to navigate. It's noteworthy that at the time of the game's creation, few developers truly grasped the intricacies of the GECK engine, making the task even more daunting.

Despite these challenges, Fallout: New Vegas shines brightly in its narrative depth and player-driven storytelling. The game's narrative, filled with intricate choices and consequences, remains one of its strongest aspects. The intricate web of factions, morally ambiguous decisions, and branching storylines offers players a level of agency rarely found in open-world RPGs.

Moreover, the world-building and atmosphere crafted within the constraints of the engine are commendable. The desolate yet vibrant Mojave Wasteland feels alive with its unique characters, varied landscapes, and engaging quests. The dedication of the developers to work around the engine's limitations to create such a rich and immersive world is evident at every turn.

Despite its technical shortcomings at launch, the modding community played a pivotal role in enhancing and refining the gaming experience. Fan-made patches and mods have not only fixed many of the initial issues but also expanded the game's potential, showcasing the passion and dedication of the community.

Fallout: New Vegas, while born from a tumultuous development environment, remains a testament to the resilience of its creators and the enduring appeal of a well-crafted narrative. Its legacy lives on not just through its flaws, but through the remarkable storytelling and player agency that continue to captivate gamers even years after its release.",1593154699,1702666091,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fallout New Vegas is a good entry point to the Fallout series as a whole. If I could ever name a game that I could confidently say that I grew alongside with, it's definitely this game. Having played the game since 2011 on the Xbox 360 and moved over to PC with countless of play throughs, every single run is a definitive experience. New Vegas is pretty simple to mod and you can easily make the game look up and feel to today's gaming standards, but even then there is a certain appeal to the vanilla experience that many of us die hard fans keep going back to.",1609477332,1702578576,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
One and 19 more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip
21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

You may have heard that this game has great humor, and that is true, especially if you get the Wild Wasteland trait; however, even if you don't get that trait you're mostly just missing out on pop culture references and a unique weapon with limited available ammo (which can fixed with mods), so if you don't like that kind of stuff just skip over that trait since most of the actual humor is in the interactions with the npcs and dialogue.

SPOILERS: The major factions all want the same thing but the key difference between all of them is how they want to accomplish that goal, and it's up to you to decide which option you like best. First there's Mr. House who wants a technocratic autocracy that thrives as it has been before the NCR and Caesar's Legion showed up. Yes Man just wants to give the Mojave to whoever's giving him order's (conveniently that's you). The NCR wants to bring ""democracy"" (interpreted as bureaucracy). Lastly, Caesar's Legion wants to rule over the Mojave with an iron fist.

The variety of weapons available in the game surpasses even Fallout 3 and I think Fallout 2, and it's the only game I know of that has grenade machine guns. On top of that, there's the ammo system that theoretically allows you to stick with one gun in all situations as long as you don't run out of ammo, although I haven't tested it because I have a hard time sticking with one weapon because there are so many with nice aesthetics.

I won't get to much into the perks and traits, but I will say that it offers plenty of variety in your build choice even if there are some basic options that you'll pick no matter what.",1662333715,1702275582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some may anwser with a veritably popular title, or an old school classic, or say that their tastes lie more in a genre of games rather than a single one. But for me, New Vegas is, bar none, my singular favorite game I own.

What can I say that the legion of other reviews, videos, and online posts haven't said about it? Praising the characters and story, that make the Mojave Wasteland feel alive and makes you feel like your character has an impact on the story? That Obsidian added a much appreciated depth to the mechanics, from survival to manufacturing ammunition to the companions, and so much more? The even with it being pretty buggy even for Obsidian and Bethesda standards it's still worth playing (especially so with mods to fix and enhance it)? There's so much that's already been said, so let me just explain why I love it: immersive replayablity.

In a lot of other games, heck a lot of other Fallouts, it's hard to sometimes make a build or keep to the spirit of who your character should be. Even if you play as a melee master in Fallout 3, a scourge upon the wasteland with blood and death in your blade and fists, your both reminded by the story that you're mostly just a son looking for his lost father and by the mechanics that don't support much melee skills. 

But in New Vegas? Get the right gear and you can cosplay as your own wasteland warlord, and the perks add DEPTH to your playstyle: not just more damage, but perks that prevent you from being knocked down or cleaving through blocking enemies to name a few. Your whole playstyle can change depending on what you pick, and the next time you decide to replay the whole thing, awaking from being shot in the head twice, you can pick something else: a scientist that uses energy weapons, a hunter that sneaks and picks off enemies from afar... New Vegas gives you the tools to do this kind of stuff, and allows you to complete the game with it if you wish to.

That's just my two cents to it, at least. The game is 10 bucks, cheaper if on sale, though I'd recommend getting the Ultimate Edition to play through the excellent DLCs. Please do yourself a favor and get it; you'll have the time of your life if you do, and if you can learn how to mod it... well, the sky's the limit, mi amigo.",1702228630,1702228630,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
One and 19 more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip
21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron

Game sucks ass even if you can get it to run stable. Story is cool tho. Too bad bethesda snubbed obsidian on the timeline for this game. couldve been so much better.

Game was halted because cazador poison wouldnt stop after using antivenom which cause me to not be able to encounter those enemies without reverting to previous saves. Its such a shame. This game has great stories and subplots and the main themes throughout wouldve only been made better if the developers were allowed to refine the gameplay (mostly fighting mechanics). If you know bethesda lore most people are of the opinion that a project lead realized obsidian was going to make a better game than fallout 3 (not hard to do) so they tried to prevent that. I regret to inform everyone that they succeeded.

The good: Several little additions make this a worthy sequel to Fallout 3. You can modify your weapons with scopes and other enhancements, and you can make your own ammo with different characteristics such as armor piercing.  Furthermore this game comes with a hardcore mode where you have to sleep and eat! There is also a more fleshed out companion system than we had in Fallout 3. The Mojavi desert seems more alive and more populated than the DC area in Fallout 3, whether that is a good thing or not is up to you. All in all all the things that made Fallout 3 great are back in this game, including the entertaining perks that give the game replayability.

The bad: Although the game by no means looks bad, the engine is showing its age. Particularly the character models are not very pretty to look at.

Your choices matter.

You can roleplay as a wide variety of characters that play diifferently.

The world is very detailed, and the story is a well-written clash of ideologies. In this game you run into plenty of interesting characters with lots to say, some of it thought-provoking, some of it funny.

Only downsides I can mention are bugs (in 150+ hours, I've had three crashes and one easily fixed mouse issue) and a slow start (you may find starting off kind of boring, but persevere and it will become great).

The mods add tons of life and nonsense, but the base game will always be something uniquely special. If ever a game was deserving of a faithful remaster, it's this one -- maybe in an engine without loading zones? But even the jank is endearing. 

Tl;dr, from the tutorial area the story is compelling, well laid out, you're corralled by skill gates you are entirely capable of learning to overcome, but until that point it guides you marvelously into one of the best written video game conflicts in the medium. It's one of the only games (that isn't a map painter/spreadsheet sim) that actually provides a compelling critique of the American system without being cringe and preachy, and actually does a reasonable job of presenting the 'bad guys' as a reasonable alternative -- even as the limited development time forced them to cut the majority of their depth and cartoonify them a bit. Even if it's not the deepest, it still provides compelling moral quandries, and meditations on what the best good for the future really looks like. 

The gameplay is a blast, VATS may have grown old in later titles but it's still a load of fun in it's original iteration (once you learn the quirks). Weapon upgrading is fun without being overbearing, and the weapons themselves are largely realistic in their function (a skill Bethesda would then immediately and permanently lose). Obsidian put in the work not just on a good story, but a well-formed world with a lot of secrets, niches, and charm. And the DLC? All of it shines in some way. 

Honest hearts is the weakest in setting and gameplay, but the characters, specifically Joshua Graham, are deeply compelling. Dead Money is a pain in a sense, but treated like an entirely different game it is a fun experience learning to survive and getting mileage out of your oft-neglected survival skill. Old World Blues is the fan favorite, a bit too reddit lolsorandom ebin rick and morty science for my tastes now, but as a kid I loved it as much as anyone else. It has a lot of fun ideas and writing, it's just a shame it became everyone's baby and the other DLCs came in underformed as a result. Finally Lonesome Road is a fantastic capstone to the story, forcing you to confront your amnesiac past and the failings of everyone in the wasteland, providing a grim look at what could be the end for everyone. All worth playing, all a good time.

Lets start with the basics.

Mass: It also tells you how much ""stuff"" is in it. Now by stuff I kind of mean atoms and molecules but different atoms and molecules do not weigh the same, so the amount of ""stuff"" is dependent on the thing we are talking about. It is also a measurement of inertia, which is an object resistance to acceleration (or deceleration). Units to measure mass include but are not limited grams, pounds, tons, kilograms, stones, etc.

Volume: How much room something takes up (3-d space) units include (cubic centimeters, cubic meters, liters, etc)

Density: Mass of an object per given unit of volume this can be found by dividing mass by the volume it occupies. (g/L which is a gram per liter, could also be gram per cubic centimeter,)

Gravity: Caused by mass, all mass exerts a gravitational pull. the more mass the more ""gravity"" it will have. Gravity is a constant pretty much every where on earth, it does decrease as you increase in altitude by it is negligible, even if you were to stand on top of mount Everest there isn't too much of a difference with the acceleration due to gravity being 9.77 m/s/s, so its negligible unless you are talking about extreme masses, but this difference is not important to the subject at hand

Velocity: Your displacement per unit of time(i.e. seconds)

Speed: Distance per unit of time (i.e. seconds)

Force: I am not talking about Star Wars force, I am talking about physics force. A vector, the product of mass and acceleration, and I mean it literally, multiply mass and acceleration and you get force. Now, gravity causes an acceleration so your ""weight"" is technically a force caused by the gravity of Earth which in free fall accelerates you by 9.8 m/s/s (9.8 meters per second per second), meaning you speed up by 9.8 meters per second every second. The unit for this is Newtons in Metric and pounds, the imperial units are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid when it comes to force cause there is stones, pounds (which is also what they use for mass), and slugs and some other ♥♥♥♥, I am not going to use them)

Momentum: A product of mass and velocity, found by multiplying mass and velocity.

Now lets get into this, a kilogram of one this is going to have the exact same mass as a kilogram of another thing. Lets look at water and ""air"" for example. Mass is a measurement of how much stuff is in something and density tells you how much stuff is in something per unit of volume (so you could say how packed in the stuff is per unit of volume). Water is a lot more dense (meaning there is more stuff per given unit of volume, or it is more ""concentrated"") than air, so you will need less water in terms of volume to get a kilogram than you would air (we are talking about air at at sea level pressure).

Now since they have the same mass they will have the same weight, since gravity is essentially is a constant at any given altitude on Earth, the water and the air will have the same weight because they have the same mass and because gravity is the same. Therefore they would press down on the Earth with the same force as well. So lets go with a scenario of you are holding the objects. To make this example easier to understand lets do this. Lets say we have two boxes that are the same size with no mass, they also don't bend or stretch. Now lets say in one you put in the kilogram of water into it and in the other box you put the 1 kilogram of air into it. Now there is 1 kilogram of stuff air in once box and 1 kilogram of water in another. So now you go to pick up the boxes, they both have 1 kg (kilogram) of mass inside them. That means the will weigh (force caused by gravity) of about 9.8 Newtons which is about 2.2 pounds for those who use imperial units.

Now just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ substitute steel/lead for water and feather for air and you get the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ result.

When idiots talk about which is heavier they talk about which would hurt more if it fells on you. A block or ball of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ metal versus a clump of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feather that not held together in any way and thus would not act as one unit/mass and then turn into a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ individual feathers than do not weight 1 pound individually. Now, because of the shape and density of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feather there is a ♥♥♥♥ ton of drag force (air resistance) acting on those individual feather prevent them from accelerating as fast. If you were to hold them they would exert the same amount of force/weight on hands. If they were to drop on your head they would exert the same force because they have the same mass and gravity is the same everywhere on Earth (for practical purposes). The difference being that if steel/lead fall on your head, it would be a smaller object because it is denser and because it is a single object held incredibly tightly together due to inter-atomic/molecular forces. Compare that to a bundle of feathers not held together, all of a sudden you drop this bundle then all of a sudden they split up because they are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ individual feather that are not held together. They will end up separating then all of a sudden you are hit by a bunch of individual feathers that do not weigh a pound that are hitting you, they are not even accelerating at normal gravitational acceleration because of the drag force (air resistance) acting on. Of course the pound of steel is going to hit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ harder, its one object that is not being affected by drag (air resistance) to the same degree as the bunch of individual feathers not being held together (much, much less than the feathers). Even if the feathers were held together it still wouldn't hit harder because it is less dense and thus needs more volume to get to 1 pound, because it takes up more space there is more area for friction/drag (air resistance) to act upon thus it won't accelerate as fast in free fall. Just because one would hit hard in that situation does not mean one weighs more than the other because like I said before it is a product of mass and gravity and because gravity is constant and in this situation they have the same as well they will weigh the same. 1 kilogram of steel multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity gives you 9.8 Newtons (2.2 pounds). 1 kilogram of feathers multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity gives you 9.8 Newtons (2.2 pounds). Therefore, a pound (or kilogram in my example) of feather WEIGHS AND HAS THE SAME MASS as a pound (kilogram in my examples) of steel/lead.

If you don't understand that pound of feathers and a pound of steel weigh the same there is no TLDR, you need to read this whole thing. I could make this longer but if you don't understand the basic concept of mass and weight then me making this longer will not do you any good.

Anyone who does not understand this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot and needs to go back to middle school or high school where you should have learned this ♥♥♥♥, if you school never taught you this then everyone in charge of the decision making when it comes to curriculum should be replaced with someone who isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid.",1702103850,1702104514,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,True,False

The game is bizarre in how great the stories, quests and rpg-mechanics are, and how unapologetically awful everything else is. 
I like the graphics because it still conveys everything needed without frying my pc. 
I hate the map design because you'll spend twice as long just walking from point A to B than you will actually doing anything. 
I love the way crippling actually affects gameplay, like how you can cripple a cazador's wings to render it grounded and slow, or how you can shoot explosives while enemy humanoids are about to throw them to blow them up, but aiming outside of vats feels like yelling instructions at a blind and deaf peroplegic, both because of various glitches and because of mechanics like ""sticky trigger"" meant to provide immersion which just end up breaking it. 
But the absolute worst are the bugs. I know, like, half of them have been fixed by the community through mods, but that doesn't excuse it, nor does the rushed developement.
Games like Cyberpunk 2077, No Man's Sky, even Fallout 76 had far worse releases and yet they got fixed. A game that got as much attention and acclaim as New Vegas should've been able to fix those themselves. Instead, we got 4 story DLCs of which only Honest Hearts doesn't have blatant flaws. Old World Blues has over-leveled enemies that take entire buckets of ammo each, with Lobotomites that can pick up dropped weapons a mile away and somehow find plasma grenades in otherwise empty trash bins. Dead Money feels like something Bethesda Fallout would have. And Lonesome Road is amazing except for Ulyssies who would actually be a genuinely interesting character if he didn't speak in redditor, making his story so incredibly vague and difficult to understand that most people still don't know why he wants to nuke the long 15.

I loved New Vegas, hence why I dedicated 20+ days worth of time in it and agree that its the best Fallout game, but I would like for us to take a moment to acknowledge that ""best Fallout game"" is a very low bar to cross. Its a very good game.",1649164829,1702070937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not playing this game is a disservice to yourself. It's a classic, but still holds up to this day and I would argue, is still one of the BEST games I've ever played. If I could wipe my memory and play this game for the first time over again I'd do it, and then promptly wipe it again so I could do it a third time. 

Fallout New Vegas is a beautifully crafted example of what games can and should strive to be. There is never a dull moment, you will feel the impact you make within the world and it's very very rich and well written story. In Every other Fallout title (3 and 4) I skipped the main story and had fucked off to do what I wanted because the game gave me such a narrow scope to play the ROLE PLAYING game. But I was hooked instantly by this game by literally being shot in the damn face. 

That being said. This game is not without it's bugs. A common one I ran into was the continue option loading forever. Uninstall and then re download. I recommend using the 'load' option and physically select your latest save file you'd like to start from. And sometimes when using scoped weapons the scope was blurry like I was looking through a kaleidoscope. Save, quit your game, shut down and then restart the program. 

However, to discount this game because of 2010 bugs would be a crime.

That all being said. Go get shot by Benny. Trust me, the game is completely worth it, with or without Steam sale.

Your choices, character composition, and playstyle matter. If you are good enough at sneaking, you can skip right past all the enemies. Shortly after doing so you realize this is a terrible idea when you accidentally alert a patrol, and everything in the vicinity attacks you all at once.

It is insanity that Obsidian developed this game in the time that they did, and how they were screwed by a certain shameless mainstream media reviewer by one point.

After being battered with youtube videos that contained nothing but effusive praise for the game, I grudgingly gave it a shot and I am glad I did. In many ways it feels like a shining example of what a modern Western RPG should be, filled with great characters, great stories, and fascinating choices to make. The DLCs are possibly even better, with strong narratives that are not only great self-contained stories, they connect to major background characters in the main game and build up to the final DLC, Lonesome Road. The only downside is playing RPGs afterward won't feel the same again; ""why can't these games be as good as New Vegas"" will nag you for a long time.

Due to the concern of kids going on steam and playing mature content, Germany censors some 18+ games on the platform, including this one. While the censorship is annoying, that's not my main issue. If you're German, chances are you purchase, download and open New Vegas only to realize it's hard stuck in the German language. You want to experience the original version and voice actors? You simply prefer a different language? You happen to purchase the game while in Germany but don't know how to speak German? There is no way to change this, you will have to play the game in German.

The store page gives you a warning that the ""low violence version"" is only in German, yet you are not told before, during or even after your purchase which version of the game the censored one actually is. For those wondering, it's the standard version. If you want to play the game in any other language you will need to buy the ultimate version and pay double the price. I'm sure the extra content is great, but I should not have to pay double just to play in my preferred language to appeal to a law that was made for people younger than me.

It is so egregious that I can only just barely squeak out a recommendation. What's that you ask? Well, Radio New Vegas cautioned that you should not taunt a super mutant for taking the bunny slope at the ski resort. So you [b]know[/b] what I was fixing to do when I got to the Jacobstown Ski Resort. That's right; taunt a super mutant for taking the bunny slope. It is with great disappointment that I must inform potential buyers of this game that, despite what the radio man suggests, [i]there are [b]NO[/b] super mutants to bully for taking bunny slopes[/i]. 

Absolute travesty of a design decision! This game would be a complete 0/10 if it weren't for the amazing character system and the whole rest of the world Obsidian created.

I joke; I kidd of course. 9/10 game. Because wow does it have depth and wow does it actually allow role playing! It did take me about 10 hours for it really hook me. But when it did, it was obvious why this is the most beloved Fallout game. New Vegas actually feels like a real, living world that you could find 200 years after a global nuclear war with real decisions to be made that matter. Fallout 3 in retrospect looks farcical. 200 years after a nuclear holocaust, and all there is a raiding gangs fighting over prewar food, yet some of them somehow have working power armor? Right. Sure.

As for gameplay, well standard Gamebryo complaints i.e. bugs, glitches, iffy graphics, bad animations, [i]awful[/i] gunplay.

With that being said there are flaws and bugs all over, you cant find a fallout without bugs. but that's not what you should be looking for in a fallout game. You could speak all day about the bugs or crashes or lack of any real quality graphics but that's just how good this game is. You will love this game despite all of it's flaws, if you love games for graphics or perfection this just simply isn't for you.

I think if you haven't played a fallout game then you're just simply missing out on a wonderful series of games. Even the first few fallout games are still good, different than a first person shooter but still good in their own way.

 I encourage you to buy this and experience the magic of fallout or get it to replay it, do all of the side quests or don't. Be good or be bad or do whatever the heck you want.

It starts off with such a strong hook, your character gets shot in the head and you are looking for revenge, and carries that hook throughout the whole of the main story. Not only that, but every single location in the game is unique and interesting, and many out of the way areas are directly pointed to for various quests, so you won't miss these incredibly interesting and captivating locations.

Not only this, however, but every character you come across is interesting and fleshed out in their own right. Hell, even certain throw-away characters are fleshed out more than characters in other games, who are suppose to be ""main"" characters. You have a vast range of different personalities, from ruthless fascistic dictators, to drunk caravan girls, and even gay scientists. 

This game also does moral dilemmas incredibly well, giving you reasons to do certain things, even if they may seem ""bad"" or ""evil"". There are always reasons behind the evil, and that leads to incentives for siding with the choices which are morally worse. On top of this, these moral dilemmas lead directly into what makes the main story so great. Every faction that you find throughout the Mojave isn't necessarily evil, but they're also not perfect, either. The NCR look to bring order to the Mojave, but they lack the manpower to do so, and most residents in the desert don't support their encroaching grasp, either. The Legion slaughter all who oppose them, enslaving or forcefully recruiting the survivors, but they see this as the only way to maintain a strong grasp on the wastes, and to keep their people protected. Mr. House wants to expand the Strip, making it into the waste's largest money-making machine. He can protect the Mojave with his army of robots, however in doing so, he also keeps New Vegas segregated.

All of these small things lead to a story that is interesting and enticing which easily holds your attention and keeps you hooked. Even more impressive, however, is that this game was made in 18 months.

Oh, also, being bisexual is objectively the strongest choice you can make in the game, and you can also recruit a sex robot, so that should automatically sell you on this game, if you aren't already sold.",1701741556,1701741556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What is Fallout New Vegas? Why is it so popular? Why do players keep coming back to it? I'll answer all of these questions. First of all Fallout New Vegas is obviously a game that takes place in the Fallout universe and there is no such bs as ""different universe"" or ""different timeline"" it takes place 4 years after the events of Fallout 3 however it has no direct connection to Fallout 3. You play as a courier who got nailed by a dude in a checkered suit and his ""mercs"" for hire, I won't say anything else as that would be a spoiler however the game isn't just about getting your revenge it is MUCH MORE than that.

Why is it popular? Memorable characters, New and reworked guns and gameplay mechanics, The details in this game are top notch, modding support, virtually infinite replayability value and much much more. Suffice to say you will play this game more than once if you give it a go. Even at the time of writing this I have almost 260 hours on record and I'm not done with FNV I have many more hours to sink into this game.

Now, Why do players keep coming back to it? Although I already gave the reason for this previously but I'll say it again its because of the modding support and replayability value this game offers. There are quite a few endings to this game and even in my 260 hours I haven't seen all of them.

Now that I've answered all the question its time for the verdict. Absolutely recommended, However consider buying the game on discount with all the dlcs. Despite being given only 18 months to work on this Obsidian came through and delivered a gem

Fat Nerd Rating (Out of 5, 10, and 100:) 4.8/5, 9.8/10, 98/100
Fat Nerd Summary: This game still holds up against the RPG's of today, an outstanding atmosphere with Vega's largely alive society, the Mojave wasteland is what you would expect coming out of Nevada. Courier 6 is one of the most bad-ass characters in any RPG game because the dude literally gets a pistol shot to the head, gets up and goes to the man that killed him but to do so has to question random strangers among the wasteland, eventually finds him and either can work with him or kill him. It's just a throughly-thought out story with an amazing story line and solid characters.

27-100+ hours to complete, Fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland survival open-world RPG with enough content and questlines to seriously keep you busy. While the graphics are outdated, the gameplay is very exciting with each playthrough feeling different due to the various ways you can solve a questline, the multiple factions to join, and the various game endings to find. In addition, I highly recommend purchasing the DLCs, as they introduce new maps, weapons, items, apparel and npcs to keep things fresh. However, due to Bethesda being notorious for their bugs, I sincerely recommend downloading an anti-crash and game stabilization mods from Nexus.

I had an unforgettable time playing Fallout: New Vegas for two reasons, one, it’s genuinely a fun and incredible game, and two, the insane game crash rate I experienced in the DLCs. Old World Blues must have been over thirty, and Honest Hearts was unplayable. I dropped the game for about three months to take a break, and upon coming back, the game seemed to have fixed itself somehow, as I only crashed once in Dead Money. Despite the game's unreliable stability (or reliable instability), it’s still worth buying and playing, although personally, I like Fallout 4 more by a significant margin.

_________________________________

From the moment you step into the post-apocalyptic Mojave Wasteland, the depth and complexity of the world become apparent. The narrative is a triumph, offering a branching storyline filled with moral ambiguity, political intrigue, and memorable characters. Your choices carry weight, shaping the fate of the Mojave and leaving a lasting impact on the world around you.

The level of freedom in character development is outstanding. Whether you choose to be a smooth-talking diplomat, a skilled marksman, or a tech-savvy scientist, the game accommodates your playstyle, providing a truly personalized experience. The depth of the role-playing mechanics, combined with the well-crafted dialogue, creates a sense of immersion rarely seen in gaming.

New Vegas doesn't just excel in storytelling; its open-world design encourages exploration and discovery. Every location, from the iconic New Vegas Strip to the desolate outskirts, is packed with lore, secrets, and dynamic encounters. The attention to detail in the world-building is remarkable, making the Wasteland feel like a living, breathing entity.

In conclusion, Fallout: New Vegas is a triumph of storytelling, player agency, and world-building. Its replay value is immense, thanks to the diverse narrative paths and the sheer number of choices at your disposal. If you haven't experienced the Mojave Wasteland yet, do yourself a favor and dive into this gaming masterpiece. It's a solid 5/5 from me, and a journey I'll never forget.",1701266821,1701266821,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Outside of the writing and some really great decisions for roleplaying, this game doesn't do a few things great, but instead does everything decently. That might sound like a backhanded compliment, and yet, what I mean by saying this is that the game works well enough [despite the bugs and crashes] to feel like a real world. I have yet to find this level of immersion in any other game. A player might accidentally break their legs and need to hoof it to the nearest doctor. Maybe you tick off one of the two major opposing factions enough that they send assassins after you. Every now and then you'll get a quest where you get to play a bit of a detective, use your medical skills to patch patients up, save some hostages, play a soldier, play a scumbag, help some goofballs fly off on a rocket, delve into deathclaw country and live to tell about it, and so many other fun possibilities. The game is fairly old, it does have bugs and crashing issues, but it's so much fun that I and many others have found the patience to roll with the issues.

Grab New Vegas on sale, and give it a try. You'll not only find a really rewarding game, but one that can be replayed many, many times. My playtime as of writing this is around 158 hours, but trust me, I've easily spent closer to 1,000 hours on console and on other devices.

Released in 2010, this game has captivated players with its unique blend of storytelling, atmospheric design, and a rich, immersive world. In this essay, we will delve into the beauty of Fallout: New Vegas, exploring the game's visual aesthetics, narrative depth, and the emotional resonance it evokes.

Visual Aesthetics:

One cannot discuss the beauty of Fallout: New Vegas without acknowledging its stunning visual design. Despite the desolation of the Mojave Wasteland, the game manages to portray a hauntingly beautiful world. The sunsets over the barren landscape, the dilapidated remains of iconic landmarks like the New Vegas Strip, and the contrasting hues of the radioactive glow all contribute to an atmosphere that is both melancholic and mesmerizing.

The game's attention to detail in depicting the aftermath of nuclear devastation is remarkable. From the rusted skeletons of cars scattered across the desert to the twisted metal remnants of once-thriving communities, the visuals tell a silent yet poignant story of a world that has faced the unimaginable. The desolate beauty of the Mojave Wasteland, with its harsh landscapes and abandoned structures, invites players to explore and discover the narratives embedded within the ruins.

Narrative Depth:

Beneath the surface of Fallout: New Vegas lies a narrative tapestry woven with intricate threads of political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and existential contemplation. The game's beauty extends beyond its visual appeal to the depth of its storytelling. The player assumes the role of the Courier, a protagonist with a mysterious past, navigating a world teeming with factions vying for control.

The multiple branching storylines and morally ambiguous choices add layers of complexity to the narrative, creating a dynamic and immersive experience. The beauty lies not just in the grandeur of the overarching plot but in the small, intimate stories scattered throughout the wasteland. Each character, no matter how minor, contributes to the narrative mosaic, offering glimpses into the human condition and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

Emotional Resonance:

The beauty of Fallout: New Vegas transcends the visual and narrative aspects, reaching into the emotional core of the player. The haunting melodies of the game's soundtrack, composed by Inon Zur, enhance the atmosphere, evoking a sense of loneliness, nostalgia, and hope. The emotional impact of the game is heightened by the interconnectedness of the characters and the consequences of the player's choices.

The relationships forged, the alliances formed, and the betrayals endured create an emotional investment that lingers long after the game is completed. The beauty lies in the emotional rollercoaster, from the elation of triumph to the pang of regret for decisions made. It prompts players to reflect on the consequences of their actions, blurring the line between right and wrong in a morally ambiguous world.

Conclusion:

Fallout: New Vegas stands as a masterpiece not only in the realm of gaming but also as a work of art that transcends the medium. Its beauty is multifaceted, encompassing the visual splendor of the Mojave Wasteland, the narrative depth of its storytelling, and the emotional resonance it elicits from players. In the vast expanse of the post-apocalyptic landscape, Fallout: New Vegas finds beauty in the ruins, inviting players to explore, reflect, and appreciate the enduring human spirit in the face of desolation.

Obsidian Entertainment's attention to detail shines through in the rich storytelling, offering multiple branching paths that ensure each playthrough is a unique experience. The morally gray decisions you face have consequences that ripple throughout the Mojave, affecting factions, allies, and the overall outcome of your quest.

The game's atmosphere is enhanced by a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, echoing the desolation and struggles of post-apocalyptic life. The Mojave feels alive, with its diverse environments, from the neon-lit streets of New Vegas to the treacherous expanses of the desert, each teeming with its own challenges and secrets.

While the graphics may show signs of aging, the immersive world, engaging quests, and memorable characters more than make up for it. With a plethora of mods available, you can enhance your experience and breathe new life into this classic title.

Fallout: New Vegas stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the Fallout series, delivering an unforgettable journey through a morally complex and atmospheric wasteland.

I did many quests for getting ending and it did well. My level was 33 at my first playthrough. Then I played second playthrough to do again but had positive and negative effects for me but still I had fun and enjoyed this game. Thanks the Choice/Option feature, I can make a decision in real life and other games. If you are FPS or Explorer Open World I recommend to all of you to play this game, and you will find an interesting story.


Edited (26 November 2023): I played my first DLC from this game, that was scary in casino and enemies were scared than ghouls and other enemies from original content. I recruited my companions and did task from old man. This DLC was very fun and scarier that I have played in my Fallout experience.

I had an issue where the game would crash every 20 minutes during the first hours of gameplay. At moments when I was actually playing the game for once, I was met with an infinite loading screen, for some reason the game would not let me exit out, the windows key did nothing when I repeatedly pressed it, same with the alt + f4, my mouse cursor was gone. Altogether, I had to manually switch off my computer which I never did with any other steam game up until this point. This game could be absolutely amazing, for me it was absolutely terrible.

I was a 16-year-old kid who didn’t care about the story, nor could I really wrap my head around all of the political themes that pervade this game. I just wanted it to be more Fallout 3 where I ran around and made heads explode in V.A.T.S. In this regard, I was disappointed. The game’s story is much deeper than what is offered in Fallout 3. I got the Ultimate Edition 2 years ago during the summer sale because I never played the DLC and got it for ~$7. Since then it has become one of my most played games on Steam and one of my favorite games of all time, so I figured I should write a review and explain why I love this game so much.

New Vegas’s greatest strength is its understanding of player choice. Obsidian made an effort to make sure that you actually have multiple choices in most (if not all) scenarios. When most games think of choice, they think you have the freedom to be either the second coming of Christ, or Satan incarnate. They take a binary approach with no middle ground. I’m sorry for opening up this old flame war, but I would use Bethesda’s quest design as an example of the binary choice I’m talking about. Fallout 3 gave you the option of either being a goody-two-shoes, or a horrible monster who is the scourge of the wasteland. In New Vegas, you can tackle every situation in multiple ways depending on how you want to play the game. Maybe you can talk your way out with the speech skill, or pass a sneak check to avoid combat. Your skills and the character you decide to play truly matter in this game. The game is less focused on the karma system of Fallout 3, and, as a result, is not as limited. There is no one right answer to many of the problems in this game.

The gameplay and combat are adequate, but, admittedly, could be much better. It has shooting system that is standard for most games nowadays, where you can shoot from the hip or aim down the sights if you wish to be more accurate. It does a decent enough job, but it does not compare to other games with a more combat-heavy focus. Guns have almost no recoil and are laser accurate, which can get boring if you use automatics. Melee and unarmed are extremely viable and are probably my favorite way to play the vanilla game. They give the game a more Skyrim/Oblivion-type feel. You’ll have fun no matter what type of weaponry you choose to specialize in, but the gunplay does feel clunky at times.

The biggest problem with this game is that it can crash a lot. My crashes did not seem as frequent as some of the others that I have read about, but I still would save very often. The game has some goofy glitches too that can occasionally screw up quests too (thankfully, since this is the PC edition, you can fix broken quests with console commands). The technical issues come because the game was developed in only 18 months, reusing most of the assets from Fallout 3. That’s not an excuse, but it gives you an idea of some of the problems in this game. 

 Overall, there is tons of content in this game. My first PC playthrough clocked in around 70 hours, and that was even when I knew where I was going. It’s definitely worth the money, and still holds up today. If you haven’t already, buy it and see what all the hype is about.

5/5
--------------------------------------------

I also want to talk about mods, but didn’t want to let it impact my review. The mods in this game take what is already a great game and make it damn near perfect. As I mentioned before, the fundamentals of this game are solid, and mods expand on that. Additionally There are so many great ones out there, and people are still modding it today. Most of my playtime is probably from just going through the countless mods that are out there and seeing what is offered. They can fix some of the problems in this game, and add seemingly endless amounts of new content. If you play this game and don’t mod it, you’re missing out on the best part.

**I must also mention that many people who buy this game lately are experiencing issues with crashing. This is due to a Windows update that broke something. Installing the New Vegas Anti Crash (NVAC) mod should fix this problem",1480039999,1700872405,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Embora herde a problemática (e hilária) engine de Fallout 3 e Oblivion - e junto com ela um combate truncado - Fallout: New Vegas compensa com storytelling e personagens memoráveis, missões em sua maioria complexas e com múltiplas soluções, e sistema que, mesmo um pouco datados, infelizmente nunca voltaram à saga (sistema de reputação, sistema de munições especiais, etc.).

A liberdade fornecida pelo jogo é um de seus pontos mais fortes: ao contrário de Fallout 3 e 4, não existem NPCs ""essenciais"" que não podem ser mortos, fazendo com que seja possível completar o jogo mesmo que todos os NPCs importantes estejam mortos, algo impossível em outros jogos da série. No completo oposto, New Vegas também pode ser completado (com boa parte de seu conteúdo explorado) sem matar sequer um ser vivo. Essa dualidade demonstra o quão bem o jogo foi construído.

Os dialogos costumam ser bem escritos e relevantes, trazendo questões políticas, sociais e filosóficas, e a motivação para o prosseguimento da história principal supera o sentimentalismo forçado da jornada para o reencontro com uma família que o jogador encontra brevemente no início do jogo, como ocorre no Fallout 3 e 4.

No matter how much time you put into this game, there is always something that you had no idea existed right around the corner. The sheer amount of dialogue is absolutely absurd, especially when you factor in that this game was developed in 18 months with nothing given to Obsidian but the assets from fallout 3. Almost every single side quest is amazing, the main story line is incredible, and the expansions truly are some of the best DLC that gaming has ever seen. Playing this game through a 2nd, 3rd or 4th time is like playing an entirely different game. You can build your character exactly the way you want to, with every build having their own strengths and weaknesses which actually do significantly effect the way that you play the game. Siding with different factions will open and close doors that you didn't even know were there, and the rewards for completing quests or simply leveling up are always satisfying and useful. The variety in weapons is near unmatched by any other game, and that statement still holds up in 2023 (at least in my opinion). If you are looking for a game that you can play for hours and hours, then come back to down the road and either start over or pick up right where you left off, this is the one. I beat this game at least 10 times on PS3, and here I am on PC still loving it. Yes, there are quite a few bugs, and the game is not even close to optimized for newer hardware, but the community still supports this game with mods to both fix the bugs the game already has as well as create entirely new quest lines, stories, maps, weapons, characters, and even perks and mechanics that aren't in the original game. I can confidently say without a doubt in my mind that this is my favorite game of all time.

I haven't installed any mods in this game after 900 hours. Just imagine, 900 hours without mods.... that's crazy. I have formed a habit of quicksaving every darn minute in any game with quicksave because of New Vegas. 

This game got diverse skills and perks which would impact how you play the game. PLUS the skills and perks that you invest could impact the story or dialogue. The diverse skills and perks would also induce replay-ability which how I got 900 hours in the game. The characters in this game is also amazing. Lots of unique characters  with deep stories, and some of them also brings impact to the world in the game. 

I truly would recommend this game to those who wants to get into Fallout series.
