Sure, you COULD use several other pieces of software that cost you hundreds of dollars a month... or you could use blender, which does all that for free.

Sure, it aint perfect, I do think on the texturing and rendering sides of things it could use some work, but for 3d modelling, sculpting and animation it's perfect, especially for beginners who dont want to risk the waste of money.

My only issue is that there are paid-for addons which have features that blender should have by default (looking at retopoflow, which has so many great tools blender should have).

     Blender has had a notorious reputation, at least in my experience, with being a difficult program to learn. I agree. For someone who has never touched a 3D/CG program I cannot reccommend enough that you don't chose blender. It is difficult to catch on just because of the shear amount of things packed into it. It has made improvements, big improvements in my opinion since I first used it, it can still be a challenge to navigate and understand. If you have dabbled in 3D/CG software before, this will still have a bit of a big learning curve and some things to get used to, *cough* right-click *cough**cough*. Like I mentioned before it can be a bit confusing just because theres a lot you can do with it.
     All that being said if you choose to stick around, if you choose to take the time to learn this, either on your own(via youtube, etc.) or paying for lessons (CG Cookie, etc.), if you choose to deal with the initial frustration that may accompany learning this program (some people might be frustrated longer than others it all depends), then you will have access to one of the most powerful CG Creation Suites in terms of what it can do, and how much it costs(free by the way). If you want to take it on I'd recommend sticking to only one feature, like 3D modeling. Focus on learning that before you start trying to learn animation or compositing (Thats not the trick that's just how I went about it.) When you get familiar enough with it everything else sort of falls together. Now lets get down to buisness...

Pros:
-Can do a lot
 -3D Modeling
 -Animating
 -Compositing
 -Video Editing
 -2D Animation (Grease Pencil)
 -Sculpting
 -3D Painting
 -Game Creation (BGE)
  -Python Scripting
 -Capable of photorealism
 -Add-ons (Free and paid)
  -can optimize some aspects of blender bringing it close to some professional program equivalent
 -Pretty big community willing to help out
  -youtube tutorials
  -Paid course tutorials (CG Cookie, Blender Guru, etc.)
  -Community Forums
  -just google it =P

Cons:
 - A lot to learn in one suite
  - Not for the faint of heart
  - Nor for the short of patience
  - Don't expect to learn this overnight
 - Right-clicking, not huge but can take a bit to get used to
 - because there's so much you can do in blender, when asking the community anywhere a question you need to be 
    specific (ie., ""I wanna know how to make my flower look like this one."" Like in the compositor, materials, textures, etc. 
                  not a very good example but meh.)
- Blender is generalized not specialized/optimised 
 -In other words comparing its Sculpting to something like Zbrush you'll see some stark contrasts
 -Same holds true with some of its other features
  -Personally, though, I think its animation (rigging, weight painting, animating) is better than Maya but that's me.
- Blender Game Engine (BGE) is real nice and you can make some impressive things, however it does fall short when you compare it to other game engines like Unity or Unreal
  
Personal experience with this is I was first exposed to blender when I was 12 in 2006 I dabbled in it and was really confused what was happening eventually after a few days I just gave up. I didn't feel I was making any progress let alone know what I was doing. I didn't touch it again until nearing the end of my sophomore year in college since then I got more involved with it. When I found out it came on steam I was already in 2nd semester Junior year so what you see are hours after I found it here I've had a longer time with this than what you see. Prior to this I was taking classes that taught 3DS Max, Maya, Zbrush, and Mudbox. Blender was self-taught (not counting CG Cookie).

All That being said I'm sure I might have missed some things but I hoped I explained enough to answer most questions on this.",1488078758,1488078847,True,73,1,0.871154546737670898,3,True,False,False

While there are other 3D programs you can get to use free, like maya, you have to use those under student or learning licenses, and cannot monitize your creations. overall, there is nothing you can do in maya or 3dsmax that you cannot do in blender.

the good, the bad, the ugly:

the good:

•beyond the core of blender, which is c++, the interface and everything is python coded, so those with the desire or ability can quickly learn to add functionality or scripting to automate tedious tasks.

•Being open source there is a large community that can help with any problems or questions, and numerous youtube tutorials exist.

•blender wraps functionality of 3D design/editing, rendering, sculpting, video editing, and even a game engine into itself.

•once you get used to it the left click 3D cursor (little aiming reticle that exists on the screen) is extremely useful for number of tasks.

the bad:

•if your goal is to learn methodology and skills in 3D modeling then the program is great. however if your goal is to indicate on a resume you have experiance with a specific modeling program your going to have a tougher time. blender is not one of the 'industry standard' programs and thus if you join a team or employeer you may find yourself spending a good chunk of time relearning interfaces and retraining muscle memory to work in specific software they want you in.

the ugly:

• the UI is unique to blender. expect a learning curve. everything is designed with shortcuts in mind and it takes time to learn them. however if you take the time to learn and become accostumed to the layout tasks are very streamlined in general.

•if you run blender through steam look up a tutorial on how to migrate settings and customizations between versions. this ones one steam; with no way to prevent automatic updates for specific programs when blender updates it will create a new folder for user preferences when the version number changes. doesn't happen too often, once a year maybe, but be aware this is something you may encounter, but can overcome.",1485819539,1485819539,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
