السكريات: 12غرام.
الدهون: 8 غرام.
والجدير بالذكر بأن القيمة الغذائية للحليب ستختلف قليلًا باختلاف نوعه الذي يعتمد على نسبة الدهون فيه. والجدول التالي يوضح الفرق في نسبة هذه العناصر في 100 غرام من الحليب كامل الدسم والحليب قليل الدسم: [2،3]

العنصر الغذائي	نسبته في 100 غرام من الحليب كامل الدسم	نسبته في 100 غرام من الحليب قليل كامل الدسم
الكربوهيدرات	4.8 غرام	4.97 غرام
البروتينات	3.15 غرام	3.48 غرام
الدهون	3.25 غرام	0.97 غرام
يحتوي حليب البقر، خصوصًا الحليب كامل الدسم، على نسبة جيدة من الدهون، وتكون معظم الدهون في الحليب على شكل دهون مشبعة، إذا أنها تشكل 70% من كامل الدهون في حليب البقر، أما حول الدهون الأحادية غير المشبعة، فهي تشكل 28% من الدهون في حليب البقر. [1،3]

يعد حليب البقر خاليًا من الألياف الغذائية، وتكون معظم الكربوهيدرات المتواجدة في على شكل سكريات بسيطة وأهمها سكر اللاكتوز. [1،3]

تأتي بروتينات الحليب بنوعين رئيسيين، الأول الكازين والذي يشكل 80% من بروتين الحليب، أما الثاني فهو بروتين مصل اللبن، والذي يشكل 20% من بروتين حليب البقر. [1،3]

أما حول مقدار السعرات الحرارية في الحليب، فتزود 100 غرام من حليب البقر كامل الدسم الجسم بـ 61 سعرة حرارية، في حين أن نفس الكمية من حليب البقر قليل الدسم تزود الجسم بـ 43 سعرة الحرارية. [2]

For the record, I am a huge fan of Civ 5 and I've been trying to adapt my game sense from Civ 5 to Civ 6, it just doesn't connect most of the time because the game has a lot of questionable changes from Civ 5.

TL;DR if you wanna try a Civ game, please try Civ 5 instead.

Bad things:
- Movement is heavily nerfed, where you can't inch out moves to a high cost hex if you have only 1 movement left. Previously in Civ 5, you can still cross a river if your remaining movement is 1. Mobility feels really bad now especially when surrounded or on some terrains that randomly has hills next to it, making exploration feels really bad.

- Global Happiness is changed to Amenities. Amenities are basically Local Happiness per city. The Amenity system is a huge problem mainly for expansion because the new city can't grow big without building amenity buildings and in extension, the housing system. In Civ 5, since there is a Global Happiness, you can carry the newer cities in happiness by having higher overall happiness to begin with, so they grow without any halt, making the newer cities not so much of a burden than it is worth. With the Amenity system AND the Housing system in Civ 6, obviously, the newer cities are basically a burden to your civilization until you decided to build amenity buildings with workers, which have its own problem.

- Workers are expendables now with charges. It doesn't make sense in any explanation. Do the workers just die after building some buildings now? Anyway, this means that you have to spare some production in your cities to build more workers now instead of other useful productions which feels very bad for the progression.

- The general UI is opaque, ugly, and hard to read sometimes. They settled with a hard opaque blue for the background of their UI, which makes it harder to read the fine details and numbers. Also, the fog of war is a novel idea being a map and all, but the brown color hinders a lot of the readability of the terrain especially if the terain itself is yellowish in color.

- Districts instead of buildings. Novel idea at best, which tries to utilize empty hexes into use. But this is where you also need to upgrade a city's amenities, housing, and also libraries, workshops, etc. ""You'd have to think what you wanted to build in your city, which is good for the amount of strategy approaches you have"" is what I would say if amenities and housing isn't so much of a problem to begin with.

- The Culture track is a research tree now. Only difference is that you have to apply the cultures within a card system to actually apply the culture for your civilization. It is a bad change in general. Culture track is executed better in Civ 5 with the Social Policy system where it is a selection of different cultures depending on your choices and speciality. It is understandable that Cultures need to be researched before you actually apply it in the society, but putting this in Civ 6 feels like every civilization don't have their distinct playstyle in culture. Every civilization feels like it has the same culture because you have to start with the same one because you have to research them, whereas in Civ 5, you can already start with a different tree.

- Envoys from what I heard is how you be allies with a city state, however I haven't touched that system ever, it looks unnecessarily convoluted for their own good. Civ 5's city state allying system is kinda bad because it dumbs down to spending gold on them at the end game, but it is easy to understand and straightforward. I can't seem to understand Envoys and the beginning fact that you need envoys instead of gold to befriend them is another ""unnecessary currency"" in my book.

- Golden Ages doesn't feel rewarding at all, I don't even know when is my Golden Age. I've reached Golden age one time but it doesn't even have any effect on my civilization. This point is just me being confused, which is also elevated due to the UI being terrible.

- Character design is a straight downgrade. They directed the designs to more cartoonish than somewhat ""realistic"" and ""grounded"". As a result, they all look ugly. Not a single character or leader in this game looks good in my opinion. The designs between characters are vastly different and incoherent they seem to not be the same species. For all I know some of the leaders could be an alien.

- The natural disaster DLC pretty much ruins the game's pacing and knowledge. Previously, settling on a flood plain / besides a river is generally a good choice because you will have access to fresh water, and that leads to more population. Now, there are disasters and flood plains can actually flood now and it destroys a city's economy just like that. That inherently teaches everyone to not build on areas that actually makes the civilization prosperous, the logic is ass-backwards.

- The hero DLC (I think it's a DLC) is also convoluted, and unrewarding to make those heroes, because they will die of natural causes after a few turns.

There are some good changes like the Wonders built occupying a hex to prevent ""Wonder Racing"" is good, and the multiple leaders approach of the same Civilization is great so you can pick and match which leader of that civilization is the best for your playstyle. However, as mentioned above, I can't recommend this due to the huge amount of negatives outweighing the positives.",1708661314,1708666909,False,5,0,0.554418504238128662,2,True,False,False

Part 1 of this game has been around since 1991 and was the reason for me to buy a computer way back when. In this game you can play dozens of different leaders and nationalities. You can build world wonders like the Pyramids, the Eiffel tower or the Statue of Liberty.
It all starts off in the stone age, where you research technologies like the wheel and pottery. As you progress through the eras you go from classical times to the medievals and, after a while, way beyond to the future era. The technologies you unlock make it possible for you to build better fighting units like horsemen and archers in the beginning, to tanks and fighter jets in later eras, a s well as a host of rescourses previously invisible  on your map. A similar thing happens with culture, where you unlock new systems of government, new buildings and wonders.
You can start a religion by earning a Great Prophet. You can also recruit Great People like Albert Einstein and Rembrandt van Rijn. Each with his own unique benefits.
There are a nember of different ways to win including a war victory, a diplomatic victory and a space race victory. In the last you must be the first to settle on Mars! I reccomend you play this game against the computer. (single-Player) As the game takes a long time to finish and this may not be feasable for players in different time zones.

Thing is, this game is plain boring.
I would even go so far and say that you actually do not need to make any strategic decisions, since the development is straight with no real possible iterations. There is literally no real possibility of a derivation tactics.

Probs my biggest complain: it takes like for ever and not much happens in the meantime 

The AI actions are incredible stupid - as others already pointed out. You get denounced for no reason, you get aggression for no reason, your friend starts a war for no reason etc.
Also I do not think it is that well balanced - even if it makes a first impression of being sophisticated.
To separate the culture tree from science research tree - ok, but combining free market with communism?! Sure is weird.
The different forms to win may sound appealing - as it is a derivation of what you usually get of games within this genre, but this gets demolished by the irrational behaviors of the AI and game wise through the constant need of increasing the availability of resources. 
In other words: The more science buildings, the more science points. the faster the research etc. this can be transferred to any other building tree of the four main ways to win. SO it boils down to the question of who can efficiently build the first towns and conquer enough space to be the largest empire in order to gain the greatest advantage resource wise.
So, under the bottom line, if you are dominant with your military, you are safe to win. Also concerning diplomatics btw., as you can easily influence your neighboring empires with resources to trade for diplomatic points. Plus you can easily win those challenges or wagers for aid requests if you are just a large enough empire. Or eradicate the one threatening to win if necessary ^^

As mentioned earlier on, basically in this game you have nothing to do, nothing happens - a one click thing. 

After the tutorial (which I didn't finish since it already bored me to death but maybe spend 3h in it and that is incredible long for a freaking tutorial), I had hoped for more exciting gameplay with more nations involved - so started a game. Yeah now after much over 30h played and at round 350whatish of 500max and I won with science - launching all 4 space projects in a row. But I chose this approach since it was the most appealing to find a disclosure with this game and finish one game and never go back there again.",1708450195,1708450195,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The AI can simply poop out troops with complete disregard for supply/materials, and can do so endlessly. For the average casual player this means you simply can't win on play-style alone at ""Prince"" difficulty or above, you have to rely on sheer luck for the AI to fight each other and keep themselves from out-developing you. Mods to try and level the playing field (without simply using cheat mods that make you invincible) are worthless, as the AI can manufacture top-level (or always one or two levels above yours) regardless of their tech level or materials available.

For reference, I used to LOVE this game. I think I picked up my first Civ game around Civ 3 and enjoyed all of them up to this one. Civ 6 PRIOR to the Gathering Storm DLC was very playable, but the Devs seem to now require a Master's Degree in Civ-ology just to play against the AI, and don't even bother with the older Civs as they are almost across the board complete crap vs the newer Civs/Leaders. 

if you watch enough Vids on Leader/Civ ""rankings"" you will not find an older/original Civ in the top. Virtually all of them reside at average or below. So forget about playing your favorite/home Civ. Most amazingly, the strongest (historically) Civilization on the planet is one of the weakest.

The game is simply not for the casual player who wants to sit down and play the game after a crap-tastic day at work .. it will only add to your frustration .. lol. Though you can play at a lower difficulty level and on ""Standard"" rules the AI still cheats it's fanny off to win.

If you're interested in history through the eras, the warfare around said history, famous figures, - or if you'd enjoy a game that mixes elements of classic tabletops like Risk with modern RTS video game aspects (such as turn-based combat, attrition/expansion elements, base building & management, negotiations, enduring & drawn-out conflicts... etc.), then Civ 6 will satisfy you, trust me.
I grew up on games like C&C, Halo Wars, and Supcom, and also love non-combat city builders like Sim City or Cities Skylines, but never found a game that combined the two in a presentable form until playing this, and Civ 5. You claim a capital for your nation, expand as quickly & efficiently as you can, tech-up through the eras until you eventually claim victory - which itself can be achieved in a variety of ways... religious domination, cultural popularity domination, and good old fashioned brutish conquest are just three ways in the vanilla game. Not to mention that you develop friendships or rivalries with other nations along the way, start to finish, and these relationships can and will impact your odds of coming out on top if you don't play your cards right.
Aside from that blurb, it comes with mod support, a decent map editor, access to the Steam workshop (tons more maps if you aren't familiar with the editor, or mods to spice things up), and in terms of hardware requirements... well, I play on an Asus, which can't run Ark Ascended or BF2042 on lowest settings - but it can run just about anything else I've played besides those two and others like without mah boi having a stroke - and Civ 6 on max settings even with additions to graphics through mods runs without any issues.

Case point: It's a very fun, addicting, and well-polished game. It is always on sale it seems, and the base price isn't very unreasonable for what you get out of it. Not having any of the DLC's isn't going to severely negatively impact your experience, BUT having them does add a ton more content to enjoy.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1708358071,1708358071,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT--16-Feb.-2024---At some point updates have made this game fairly unplayable when mixing in interesting (i.e., necessary) mods. It is forever crashing or failing to properly load mods. My hope for Civ 7 is that much, much, much, much, much, much more robust mod support alongside much, much, much, much, much, much more transparent and easily findable logs. It's really not clear to me what causes crashes. Beyond a possibility that it's something to do with assets...which are capped at a monumentally small amount. Civ 7, needs to support out of the box 4~5 times the assets it actually comes with in order to facilitate access by the mod community. Support for 20,000+ assets is a must. 

So still not recommended. Ultimately, while Civ V remains somewhat better than Civ VI, I do believe the true height of this game with respect to optimal and robust functionality (and lack of crashes) was Civ IV. Which is pretty sad.",1627072099,1708100201,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overly-scripted and over-prescribed requirements for city districts and wonders. The idea of unstacking the city is not a bad one, in theory. But with all the adjacency bonuses, it becomes too much of a hassle. And then the wonders- since when does the statue of zeus take up an entire tile?! You should be able to built it in your city center, or in another district. But instead each wonder has a host of adjacency requirements. ""Must be built adjacent to a river, adjacent to city center, adjacent to a science district, and on hilly desert terrain""... come on. All this takes away from the fun organic nature of civ that was a hallmark since the beginning.

Additionally - the AI has some major issues. It is incompetent. I find it annoyingly easy to take out, and it seems to have no clue how to build an army, upgrade it, and conduct a large-scale war. I even downloaded some mods and they still suck at war.

Civilization VI stands as a testament to the enduring brilliance of the strategy genre, offering a gaming experience that transcends time. It is, without a doubt, one of the most addicting games I've ever played, delivering a complete and unparalleled masterpiece that captivates from start to finish.

The Good:

Addictive Gameplay: Civilization VI excels in creating a gaming experience that is both challenging and addictive. The ""just one more turn"" mantra is a testament to the game's ability to keep players engrossed for hours on end. The depth of strategy and the constant pursuit of victory make every playthrough a unique and compelling journey.

Strategic Depth: The game's strategic depth is staggering. From choosing your civilization to managing city development, diplomacy, and warfare, every decision feels consequential. The interplay of various game mechanics ensures that players must adapt and strategize to thrive, providing a rich and satisfying experience.

Beautifully Crafted World: Civilization VI boasts a visually stunning world with vibrant and detailed graphics. The diverse landscapes, iconic wonders, and animated units contribute to the overall immersion, bringing the historical civilizations to life in a way that is both educational and visually pleasing.

Expansive Content: The game's expansions and DLCs have consistently added significant content, enhancing the depth and variety of gameplay. From new civilizations and leaders to additional game mechanics, the ongoing support from the developers ensures that the Civilization VI experience continues to evolve and remain fresh.

The Not-So-Good:

Diplomatic Inconsistencies: The diplomatic behavior of AI civilizations can sometimes be inconsistent or illogical. Players may encounter situations where AI leaders make decisions that seem contrary to their established personality traits or the current global context.

Conclusion:

Civilization VI is not just a game; it's a masterpiece that defines the pinnacle of addictive gaming. Its addictive nature stems from the perfect blend of strategic depth, engaging gameplay, and an ever-expanding world of possibilities. Sid Meier's Civilization VI is a timeless gem that has set the standard for the 4X strategy genre, and its enduring appeal ensures that it will continue to captivate gamers for generations to come.",1708048868,1708048868,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

1. big number go up = very satisfying. The gameplay is relatively simple, in that increasing yields, both on tiles and empire wide is the go-to strategy

3. three differend gamesets / DLCs allow you to pick the gamerules you like best. Don't like the pesky climate change? Pick the base game. Do you like governors and loyalty? Pick GS or the other DLC
4. basically endless replayability due to a large number of Civs with alternate leaders and randomly generated maps
5. incredible amount of mods that allow you to customize the game however the hell you like it best

Cons:
1. the launcher

There's a lot to learn in this game and the rewards aren't there, I feel distracted all the time with all the different aspects to manage. To make it worse, the UI isn't the best, the controls are sometimes not obvious, it's hard to get an overview of what's going on and I don't like the more cartoony style the graphics has taken.

* The graphics are cartoonish.
* The AI does not know how to play the game. It often declares war and then does not send any soldier to the attacked country. This game has many adjacency-based bonuses that the AI usually ignores completely. Higher difficulty levels give bonuses to the AI, but do not make it any less dumb.
* When either the player or the AI launches an invasion, units more often than not become obsolete due to scientific research before they arrive.
* At the start of the game, there is little to do. In the endgame, there is an enormous amount of micromanagement to do and it hardly matters.
* There is enormous “snowballing” (as it is called in the civ fanatics forums). I.e.: The more of an advantage you have over your enemies, the faster such advantage grows. This is present in almost all strategy games. However, in this game it is especially nefarious because of many multiplicative bonuses.
* Development of this game (DLCs) adds additional content, but does not fix the already broken dynamics.

Overall, the biggest flaw of this game is that there is far more micromanagement than strategy. Paradox Risk-like strategy games are simply better games than this, as they do not have that flaw.",1707692561,1707692561,False,2,0,0.520905971527099609,0,True,False,False

I have played the Civ VI tutorial for a few hours and one game as Scythia to turn 200 so far.  I tend to be an empire builder with a focus on commerce and military.  I am a methodical planner.

1. The fact that the tutorial won't allow saves is ridiculous.  In prior versions, thoughtfully and slowly working through the various game stages from the tutorial was an excellent way to learn.  The Civ VI tutorial was really limited and I found the constant chatter annoying.  What I needed/wanted was explanations and the future implications of various choices.  Too much animation and audio and not enough detailed text to read.

2. The number of available civilizations to choose from is too small, and labeling them by leader rather than the name of the civilization is counter intuitive.  The game is called Civ, not Leader.  Most well known civilizations had multiple great leaders.

3. The complexity and nuances of separate tech and civic trees with policies is terrific and a vast improvement over the original Civ games - HOWEVER, the tutorial and in-game information about this stuff is severely limited.  It's annoying that I need to continually research using third party material.

4. Two days in, and it's clear that a handful of mods are not just a good idea, but necessary for those players who enjoy the long game.  The 50 move get it over with crowd might not care, but I really don't enjoy getting dozens of hours into a game only to discover that there are severe penalties for not knowing the subtleties of where to place city improvements, for example.  I'm not certain yet, but it seems as if we've gone back to the Civ II concept of specific trading between cities that rely on geographic and improvement differences between cities.  IE, an urban engine fed by rural farmers.

5. I remain confused about cursor control. I'm not used to accidentally sending units to the wrong tiles. Sometimes right click releases the cursor focus and sometimes it sends a unit.  Sometimes the escape key gets me back to the standard game view and sometimes it pulls up the game menu.  Sometimes I can't figure out how to make a screen or pop up go away - like the search tool. In short, the interface is busy, confusing and inconsistent.  I'm used to left click = focus, right click = select an option & esc = reset to basic game screen.

6. The ""turn end/next turn"" button flashes when I have units who haven't moved and who are not fortified or sleeping.  I don't understand this.  I'm wasting time ""visiting"" units to check on their movement capacity. 

7. Not certain what I think about the limitation against unit stacking and the ability for foreign units to pass right through another civ's units. It certainly changes tactics massively and was not explained in the tutorial.

8. Graphics and animations are too cartoonish.  Would love the option to tone all that down.  Builders jumping up and down and vanishing in an explosion?  I'm not six years old. It's silly and childish.   

9. Was several turns into first game before I discovered that land units could be directed across water (as if by magic, boats appear).  This is bizarre.  Here I was, methodically researching and building harbors and ships when I could have expanded to other continents already.  I don't see how this makes any sense, or how this is an improvement over the prior need to plan and organize the ability to move across large bodies of water.

10. A dialogue box asking what you want to do with a defeated barbarian outpost would be useful. Hidden somewhere is an icon that needs to be pressed to totally destroy them - I didn't know that, and they became a city state later, despite my having vanquished them early on.  Annoying as hell.  Just so many things that you have to learn through trial and error, and for those of us who actually like to RTFM, it's horrible.

11. Religion.  Sigh... there is a REAL emphasis on this and limited in-game information.  Having started on a small, 4 civ game I discovered too late that all the prophets had been snatched up and another civ had built Stonehenge.  I'm not certain, but it appears as if even if religion is not your thing, you need to found one to prevent other civs from unduly impacting you and possibly winning the game in that manner.  The idea that some other civ has units wandering my lands proselytizing fantasies and I can't do much about it is annoying.  I'd like the ability to capture those units, load them into a siege engine and hurl their corpses back across the border.

Despite all these bitches (and I have more), I am intrigued by the complexities and nuances of the tech/civic/policy construct and think Civ6 is worth investing some time in to get over what appears to be a MASSIVE learning curve.

So when Civ 6 came out, I shrugged. Civ 5 remained my go to 4X game, until now. I can confidently say that Civ 6 (as it is now, with all content and updates) is broadly a better game. I really did not expect it to be as much an improvement as it is.
Pros:
-Mechanical depth
There is just so much more to interact with in Civ 6 compared to 5. Most importantly, each system is fleshed out enough that you can focus on exploiting a select number of them in a playthrough, without feeling like there is a ""meta"" (Science was king in Civ 5. It is still relevant, but not to the same degree)

-Districts and Wonders in the overworld
The district system is the highlight of the game. However, the underlying part of this that is most important is just how much more significant the map is. City placement and planning is critical, not only for said districts but for wonders as well.

-Uniqueness of Civilizations
Civ 5 introduced ""unique abilities"" for Civs in an attempt to make subsequent playthroughs feel fresh. While there were a few stand outs, there were also a number of boring/bad abilities (America, Netherlands, France, etc). Unique abilities in Civ 6 are now split between both the leader and the civilization itself, and Firaxis was overall MUCH more inventive with them. Additionally, a result of the split is some civilizations having multiple leaders to choose from, allowing for a different strategic focus with the same civilization on a new playthrough! 

-No more national happiness
Civ 6 returns to a system more similar to Civ 4, where you now have a ""per city"" happiness condition. Some people might prefer the ""grow tall"" Civ 5 meta. Civ 6 flips that completely, with there being minimal penalty for making new cities. Personally, I prefer it.

-Graphics
I, like many others, had a negative impression of the graphics. When I first saw the cartoony art style around the games release, I thought it was a step backwards. However, I think I was wrong. In placing so much more of the city on the map, additional detail is added. You get to see the buildings you construct in your districts. Wonders show a sped up movie detailing their construction upon completion, and afterwards remain on the map. You get a much better sense of building up your empire than you did in previous games.

-Mods and Scenarios in online multiplayer
A nice addition. It is possible to unofficially patch Civ 5 to enable multiplayer mods, but not scenarios. And of course, all players need said patch. With Civ 6, you avoid this hassle.

Cons:
-AI
I've seen some comments claim the AI is worse than Civ 5. Personally I think that's hyperbolic, as it is probably impossible to be dumber than the Civ 5 AI. Civ 6 is probably about the same; I have yet to witness any great military strategy from the AI. That said, this is not a deal breaker for me. Civ games are more about managing your civilization than about being a challenging strategy game. I do appreciate the enhanced combat that Civ 5 introduced, and wish the AI could be somewhat more capable with it, but it is just one element of the game.

-No source code
If you were hoping to fix the prior issue with mods (like the Civ 5 community patch), you are out of luck. Firaxis has not released the source code, and it seems they never will for this game. No source code = no DLL mods = no modified AI.

-Difficulty modes
Higher difficulty modes still just provide a bunch of bonuses for the AI. What would be most optimal is removing the starting unit/tech/civic bonuses and replacing them with bonus yields over the course of the game (similar to what the Civ 5 community patch does). There are some mods that attempt to do this, but an official implementation would be preferable. As it stands, the ""hard"" part is just getting past the AI in the early and mid game. Just like in Civ 5, once you are ahead you will trounce them. So the harder difficulties are more of an annoyance than anything.
It would be even more interesting if the AI could scale based off difficulty, but that is probably too much to ask.

-Audio
Don't get me wrong, there is some nice music in the game. My main complaint is in regards to the music that plays while at peace. The game likes to play the themes of other civs you've encountered in the game. This is rather jarring; I much preferred the more ""neutral"" music that played for the bulk of the game in Civ 5 aside from your leaders theme and the war theme of the civs you'd go to war with. It annoyed me enough to get me to turn down/off the music at times, which I never did in Civ 5.

-2K Launcher
It can be disabled with a launch command, but it is annoying that I have to do that. Steam is a launcher, we do not need more launchers. Game publishers need to stop this.

-2K Account
No, I don't want to link a 2K account, stop asking me. It is thankfully possible to utilize cloud saves for the PC version. You just need to make sure you manually tick the ""cloud"" option in the save menu when saving. I assume this utilizes steam cloud saves, even though it is not referenced in the steam library like other games. Additionally you can edit the mod ID for the ""scout cat"" mod to access it without linking an account. Sadly, this does not work for the Caesar DLC, but Trajan seems to be a better leader anyway (free monuments).

On the down side, it's way more baffling than previous iterations.  It's hard to get visibility into some crucial things in the game - such as tourism and amenities.  There's so much stuff going on that it sometimes feels like you're just blundering your way along rather than guiding anything.  All-up, though, I think that both of those sore points add depth to the game, so I'm not sure they're really all-up bad.

Prior civ games (particularly 5) introduced some ideas that made victory-by-conquest a less-than-easy path to follow.  In 6, it feels dumb to do anything but conquest.  There doesn't seem to be anything that makes bigger empires harder to manage than smaller ones.  The ""Warmonger"" debuff, which I suppose is intended to make you stop, ends up just keeping you on the path.

They've added a new ""religious victory"" idea, but it's basically a rehash of conquest victory and happens at a pace that has no kind of historical precedent.  Further, there's no destabilizing effect from having more than one religion in your empire and no destabilizing or negative effect from forced-conversions.  Religion is far and away my least-favorite thing in civ-6.

Still, all-up, it's a civ game, so it starts from a good place.  There's certainly a lot of depth to this game so long-term-playability is certainly there and it's very easy on the eyes.

-- some ammendments after playing for a while --

The more I play it, the more I like it, as some of those opaque things become clearer to me.  Further, mods have fixed many of the things that are broken, and the workshop integration and modding support in the game seem very good.  The biggest charm to me is that there's seemingly endless depth to the game.  The more you discover the more you find there is yet to discover about it.  Even if you're completely clueless, you can still have fun playing it by dialing the difficulty back.  I mean, if you do that, you'll feel like you're being dragged along by events more than controlling the action, but as you learn, you'll feel more in control.",1699558581,1707174844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And lastly this game has no meaningful catch-up mechanics that I can deduce, if a civilization is bigger, it will have more of everything and the advantage can only grow. The UI isn't nowhere as good as Humankind and Old World, with missing explanations to buttons, completely useless civilopedia and bugs. 
BUGS. Like WTH? Such a high-profile game and I first tried it 8 years after release, and still so many bugs! The worst offender is the Linux native version which leaks like crazy (after a while the game slows down considerably and if you don't restart the game it will grind to a freeze), play the windows version via Proton.

- I don't feel any anticipation of reaching new levels of tech, religion, or civics

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]Now the graphics may not be for everyone. The artstyle is more cartoony than the other games (well from what I saw). I actually don’t mind it. The environments look pretty good and the character models (although cartoony) look great, although some leaders do look kinda off. The UI is kinda messy at times and can be pretty overwhelming for new players. The unit models and cities do look incredible (especially when you see your civilization grow). Also the wonders look really beautiful in this game. I really enjoyed the style here. It’s different and feels unique.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Now this is my first Civilization game so I can’t compare the other ones so do be warned. This game is really detailed in terms of mechanics. Many factions feel unique from each other (stronger than others at certain era’s). Early game feels pretty diverse and fun to go through. I especially love how decisions early on make a big impact. Making allies to help you defend against barbarians or enemy factions, or try and create peace with those leaders. The interactions with other leaders are really cool. Diplomacy is kinda inconsistent at times. Some Civ leaders will hate you for performing well, and some others will hate you after you annex an entire country ""In Self Defense"" when another AI attacks you for no reason. It’s a hit or miss at times and can get pretty annoying. You even have to manage your culture, government, religion, Technology and civic tree’s, and so on! This game has tons of mechanics and content that will keep bringing you back to improve your skills, experience, and experiment with different Civs. The cool thing about Civs, is that each one has their own abilities that can make each Civ pretty unique from each other. Now the game does have some problems. AI can be pretty silly. Just like how I talked about Diplomacy, they can feel pretty inconsistent at times. The AI also just doesn't feel aggressive even on higher difficulties. The locations they settle as well are just horrible, and the decisions they make are questionable at best. The game has many good mechanics, but there are some annoying issues that I wish would be fixed.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]It’s pretty bad. Even without mods, you will get desync like crazy. This is a real shame because Playing with friends can be pretty fun when you get a match together. Being able to ally and take on the world or fight each other or create peace is addicting and has a ton of replayability. You also get many options on how you want to create your lobby. You can pick the game speed, what Civs to play with, the map, and much more. If there is a fix please let me know but for me and my other friends, it was near unplayable.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]You can add hundreds of hours into this game without a doubt! Many Civs feel unique, the maps are amazing and the mechanics are really good (for the most part). You also have a Steam Workshop which will add even more playtime. The amount of replayability is amazing. If you are a strategy/sandbox fan then you might add hundreds of hours on here.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound effects are pretty good. The subtle soundtrack is nice and the voice acting (especially for the loading screen) is superb. There’s not really much to add on here. The overall environment and units also sound really good too. I have no complaints here.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven’t really come across any bugs. The game does feel pretty polished from my experience. There may be some small ones, but nothing game breaking.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Performance is really good. Playing on Max settings I had a stable 60fps with no stutters or crashes (well besides Multiplayer).[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Civilization VI is a great game for anyone into turn-based strategy games. This was my first ever Civilization game and I had a good time with it. You have many Civs to choose from with many cool maps and mechanics such as government, districts, politics, religion, diplomacy, etc. Sadly I don’t recommend the base game since it does lack some needed mechanics to spice up the replayability (such as natural disasters for example). If you are looking to play with friends then skip this game since you will deal with many dsync issues (well from my experience). Wait for a sale and get the Anthology bundle if you want to give this one a try.[/td]

I love the district system as it add a emphasis on expanding your empire to get different districts and different bonus. Civ 5 if one city had crazy production then the other cities would not become important and also you were allowed to build almost every single wonder in the game in one city. In Civ 6 you cant do that and that also make an emphasis on expanding and conquering. It allows the AI to have more chances of getting advantages in the game. You also now need to have a constant streamline of builders so you can repair from natural disaster,or build improvement to get either strategic,luxury,and bonus resources. The loyalty system in the game create boundaries for civilization into expanding near your territory and thus being able to get resources that are near your border instead of Civ just building cities literally one title away from your border. I also really like the modes such as the Barbarian clan mode because it make you question on if you want a city state ally later on in the game or   or destroy the barbarian encampment and that make the game much more strategic. It also  allows you to see if you want a buffer state against a certain Civilization. The only draw back with the game is it cartonny art style.

I uninstall, verify, try diff computers. Nothing worked. 

then i find a LAUNCH OPTION to bypass launcher - SUCCESS - Or so i was certain...

I get into a multi match and take a few minutes to pick a faction because there is ZERO INDICATION of what you own or NOT. 

I have to click ONE BY ONE through the whole list, make notes, then check faction specs. 

Then i give up - I literally gave up on that bc of time. I then picked RANDOM faction and we begin to load. 

At this point, we're fucking pumped because I just had to verify, then reinstall, then we all 4 googled for fixes to this issue - we were SO sure we nailed this. 

Then the game crashes whlie loading into the match. And again. And Again. 

I've played this game 12 minutes and steam registers .2 hours in the last 2 weeks - thats how much i was trying to launch this game, it has been adding up in a few second increments ( ish, given Process execution logging ) aside from the five minutes I spent reviewing factions today. 

I cannot possible recommend this trash to anyone. I have no problems with many HUNDREDS of other titles on this particular steam account on this particular PC - let alone my others. 

I find it really hard to believe that 30+ years of dev talent resulted in this experience - clearly there is a talent shortage at play here and the history of the series doesn't necessitate a continuance of professionalism",1706849380,1706849556,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This is most obvious with the fact that each city can literally only build one thing at a time. Not even parallel unit & building construction.

And builders are a key example of how bad the game has gotten.

They get arbitrarily wiped out by random environmental effects - setting you back 5 turns, are still only good for three things when they're expensive & fragile, and those three buildings can also get arbitrarily wiped out by random environmental effects.

I think after the better part of a decade since release, Civ VI is probably THE definitive way to experience the franchise. you can tell an immense amount of work went into the systems of this game to keep it engaging and interesting. Most of the fun of Civ is knowing that you have somewhat of a plan, but executing that plan in the most optimal way is really very difficult, there's so many systems to balance that unless you REALLY know what you are doing you will play sub-optimally, and that's okay. It is incredibly satisfying to see your plans you made a hundred turns ago finally come to fruition. 

I think Firaxis actually want you to be a bit overwhelmed with all the systems, and much like a really life leader of a nation might, you continue to come to grips with these systems and how they interact with each other, stacking bonuses as you get better at the game and more competent at making the correct decisions. I think that's awesome, because it allows the skill expression and skill ceiling of this game to be incredibly high - in my opinion, it is much higher than Civ V. 

My ONE gripe with the game is that there is simply no real option to build tall instead of wide if you want to be competitive. Because of the way district adjacency bonuses work, you pretty much need to make a boatload of cities and bunch them together to get the most out of your districts. Its a shame because in past games, production and economy maxxing by only making like one or two cities was actually really viable and a fun way to play. Hell, they even had Venice as a playable nation in Civ V where you were only ALLOWED to make one city! and you got a ton of bonuses to trade to make it more equitable and interesting. I LOVE the districts in VI, i think they make the game much more engaging, but I wish there was a way to build taller. 

Only other nitpick is diplomatic victory and the world congress still suck and are super boring to play around, and after two expansions and 8 years since launch there is no economic victory condition. All the other victory conditions are great, Religion especially has improved tenfold over previous installments of Civ. 

I really do love this franchise and I think its safe to say after many years, this game has surpassed Civ V for me. Civilization VI is the leader of the pack in 4x grand strategy games, and I suspect it will stay that way until Civ VII finally releases in the year 2050.

9.2/10, but wait for a sale and / or check G2A. 

PS, Gathering Storm is the superior expansion!

The introduction of districts and governors took a little getting used to, but has turned out to be one of my favorite things about the game.

AI is stupid, interrupts your game with lame repetitive complaints or terrible trade offers. Barbarians will keep spawning units if you don't kill their barracks. It's a mess trying to take any land because the barbarians will start attacking too. Only certain units can enter cities to claim them- otherwise you are eternally attacking this fortress so it doesn't regenerate and attack you back. Why can't rangers take it? They are on foot! Unit balance doesn't make any sense either.

I think Civilization V is a whole lot better. I don't know what other retardation I might find but I'll play it a little more just in case. The tech to unlock or research is not straightforward, you have to know the whole tech-tree to make any sense of priorities and there are restrictions and limitations that are not easily apparent. The game is so slow, yet so fast paced when it comes to picking the best path on advancing your civ and not falling behind. The religion mechanic is confusing and wasn't in the tutorial.

I referred to the discussion board and found it to be a frequent issue for a number of players (yes I am running it on a capable PC/system requirements) writing this as I uninstall it wishing I could get a full refund or preferably a version that doesn't crash every time after 4 or 5 turns!!! - 

Update as of Jan 2024: 
Re-installed the game to see if any fixes had occurred and they have for me anyway - running off Direct X11 and not 12 and the game hasn't crashed for 60 playing hours.....

So now I can actually play the game it is everything I expected from a Civ game and more I would venture to say the best yet with my biggest issue with previous versions playing on the higher levels and all the leaders denouncing/declaring war on you without reason is a lot better managed with the grievance points +/-

Especially when a large number of cities need to be taken down, it will take a lot of time to just take down the encampment districts. Hereby, Recommendations for this area of ​​the military camp are summarized below:

    I hope the encampment district can have a more intuitive positioning and upgrade route: Such as a castle (fortress) dedicated to defense; a military camp (Military Academy) dedicated to producing troops and providing great general points.

---------------------On the castle(fortress) route, you can be given long-range attack capabilities and city wall defenses, but there is no bonus to troop production, and it does not grant productivity or great general points. As the game reaches later stages, castles built during certain eras can provide cultural bonuses.

---------------------On the military camp (Military Academy) route, you can not get the long-range attack capabilities, and it only has the health of the area itself and no wall defenses. However, it has various productivity bonuses when producing units, as well as the productivity bonus of the area itself. .The great general points are awarded through the combat merits of the production units in this city.



      選擇征服勝利時，應該不少人都會被AI建造的一堆營地建築弄得很煩，尤其在需要取下大量城市下，光光打下軍營這個區域就得花上大把大把時間，茲將對軍營這個區域的建議分述如下:

      希望營地可以有更直觀的定位與升級路線:
如專門用於防守的城堡(要塞) ; 專門用於產兵與提供大將軍點數的軍營(軍事學院)

-----------------------城堡(要塞)路線，才可以被賦予遠程攻擊能力以及城牆防禦力，但相對沒有產兵加成，且不賦予生產力及大將軍點數。隨著遊戲到達後期，那些在特定時代建造的城堡可以提供文化值加成。

-----------------------軍營(軍事學院)路線，不可遠程攻擊，且僅有區域本身生命值沒有城牆防禦值，但在生產單位時有各種加成，以及區域本身的生產力加成。而大將軍點數，則藉由此城市生產單位的作戰功勳給予。",1623062351,1706018012,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Here’s a list of things the AI is bad at, or will never do:
•	They don’t use generals strategically.
•	When they get an admiral, they sail it around like a scout and never use its bonus.
•	If you do not share a border with a Civ you are at war with, they will never be a threat because the AI cannot comprehend moving units in a way that is not linear.
•	I have never seen an AI put aircraft on an aircraft carrier.
•	I have never seen an AI use a weather balloon with artillery. Without the weather balloon, artillery is essentially useless.
•	I have never seen an AI use a medic. (Guru’s yes, however).
•	I have never seen an AI build a fort. (not an encampment).
•	Naval combat is pathetic. One time a few of my frigates ran into an enemy submarine. The sub could have destroyed my ships, but it never attacked, and I was able to whittle the sub down in a few turns and kill it. This made no sense.
Every game play s out the same. All AI are very powerful and aggressive at the beginning, but if you are able to survive to the Industrial Era, all AI, no matter the difficulty, just starts to disintegrate. AI doesn’t seem to know how to build a modern military. If you destroy its military in the medieval era, they don’t seem to build it back. Let’s be honest, combat is the most fun part of the game, so the fact that the AI is so terrible at it takes away the best part of the game. 

When you don’t align with their ideals, they have to interrupt the game to tell you constantly. It’s super annoying and childish.

As a Canadian, it's great finally being able to play as my country, and when I saw this month's special event, I decided to load it up again, but first play through the game on prince to refresh myself. Of course, it didn't take very long to remind me what I dislike so much about this version of the game.

Start Game feels too much like the hunger games. Between all the barbarians coming in from all sides, combined with the other city-states and civs getting a little too close for the liking, I always feel so much pressure to be very aggressive with a strong military at the beginning - except the game I would prefer to play is peaceful and explorative . . . and that seems to involve a whole lot of ""options tuning"" on my parent to make it happens, which I don't like having to do. I think the game has a ""standard"" format, and I don't like doing things such as removing barbardians when I think they are supposed to be an intended part of the experience.

Related to the above point, with so many civs battling for resources, there's a huge need to have many many settlers and city creation. So the early game involves to much flag posting while you maintain various mediocre cities. I really enjoyed being able to turtle in CIV 5, as well as just focusing on at most 10 cities by end game.

I have beta versions of more stable games from tiny dev companies that run better. 2K has to be the worst.

The only really playable mode, multiplayer, has loads of technical problems, though it's not quite a buggy mess.

I have been playing all the Civ games since the first one in the mid-1990's. I recently even tried playing the early Civ's. But they have not aged well. I would hate to think how many thousands of hours I spent (not lost?) playing these games. But I must say that CIV 6 is indeed the best one yet. There now two trees, one for tech and another for social changes more sophisticated than CIV 5. AI is better, especially for the city-states, but even for the other civ's (a peeve of mine from the beginning). I actually do like the new idea of developing regions around the cities and not just putting everything into the cities, completely new from the past civ's. The game is much faster to complete, which I think is good, too. One can combine military units into corps to enable up to three in a hex. 

But I do have two complaints, one huge and one trite. The trite one is that instead of using historical faces, all civ leaders look like something out of a Disney movie. They are all goofy looking and some of the kings appear like they spend 4 hours body building a day. But my main complaint which is related to how fast the games end is that the tech tree ends about 30 years in the past. There are no future technologies except for the generically described ""future tech"". Previous civ's, especially the earlier ones, went boldly into the future by generations. This is very strange for me. Nonetheless, endlessly replayable with some real improvements (except for the short tech tree) I give this a 9/10.",1553172376,1705774038,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a mix of; 
-Settlers of catan (with hex shape tiles that are new every game)
-7 Wonders (you literally build every wonder you can think of throughout the game)
-and most importantly RISK (you can fight and conquer or play it chill and build up)

I have 1 or 2 hours on the game so far.. i have currently got a win with 60 or so civs out of 80 ish civs... The replay ability is great.

There are things i hope they add in the next game or a DLC.. some reason you cant unbuild districts and other buildings... meaning a miss click can ruin the layout of your city... Unit pathing you need to pay attention to as if there is a unit on the choke point tile, your unit will bugger off the wrong way trying to go around the mountains or whatever rather than patiently wait a turn for gap to open up... can be a real pain in the ass. Auto exploring is often pointless as they always go in the stupidest direction possible....

I have other gripes, but they are all small. The game is great fun and i highly recommend it.

I might be biased because I never played any solo campaign. All of my experience playing this game was from online coop, and I couldn't agree more that this game gave you a relaxing moment with your friend.

Where you could chat with them, venting out some of your day problems, while thinking about your next move, without the need to overthinking about your game, because this game was so chill IMHO (I always played on Emperor difficulty, but sometimes I played on Deity).

unique great people: The idea of Einstein giving you a different buff to that of Plato is interesting but in reality, you are in a position to just meta-pick certain scientists with some having major benefits in comparison to others. 

Districts: overall a stupid idea. Why would I have to build a library for my city in a district that is several tiles away a mountain range? Takes away the city-building aspect you had from CIV5. realistically, these districts should be optional should you wish to optimise a particular city for a function ie: religion, science etc. 

Art: The other reviewers are idiots, it looks like a mobile game.  The fog of war is very irreparable at times as well, CIV5's fog of war is much greater on the eye as here you are stuck in a black and white view of lands you do not have coverage of. The Cities themselves feel very limited and do not grow past a certain size on the map. In CIV5 your cities would visibly grow into metropolises as the population grew but here it looks to be stagnant once you pass level 10+ in pop.

Wonders: Make sense that some wonders take up a tile ie: pyramids, but as you get through the game, your lands end up looking like a monopoly board with all these random buildings scattered everywhere. There is also an over-exaggeration of geographical and district requirements to build wonders. 

units: to keep having to build workers after their use  and having to rely on trade to build roads, excluding Rome, makes the early game feel monotonous.

Misc: 
The game tells you information in a much more ugly way in comparison to CIV5:
- when a wonder is built it will never show you which one was built like in CIV5, you now have to hover over the icon in the bottom right.

The golden ages function is cringe, you are punished for not playing in a certain way the game wants you to play. 

Movement is clunky and changed unnecessarily compared to CIV5. makes early game scouting and war play like a ball ache.

It's a really solid game! The gameplay is engaging, the visuals are pretty great, and there's a lot of variety in how you can play the game. The DLCs are brilliant too, especially Rise & Fall and Gathering Storm. There's even a battle royale mode, if you want that from a strategy game for some reason.

I'd definitely recommend it if you have an interest in strategy games or history.

However, I will tell you the game is still overpriced for all it's worth. This is the kind of game you get on sale, not for the full cost. But when it goes on sale, it's usually for an absolute steal of a price (I got the game and all of the DLC for like, half the cost of the base game, for reference).

After those hundreds of hours you might start complaining about certain mechanics that you don't like, but you would never argue that the game isn't worth the money you spent on it. 

If you haven't played Civ 5 it's probably worth starting there because you can get it very cheap on sale. If you are still in love with Civ 5 and are wondering if Civ 6 is a big jump forward, I'd say it's not, really. But as someone with 800 hours in Civ 5 and has finally reached a point where it's not fun anymore, Civ 6 offers enough differences to make it feel fresh again. 

Particularly I like that each tech has it's own 'quest' that if completed gives a huge boost towards learning it. E.g. finding a natural wonder gives a big boost to learning Astrology. This helps each playthrough feel more unique as you may be tempted to take different routes depending on what quests are easily completed for you.

I think there are a lot of good ideas that build on the previous game, the fundamental problem tho is that the cluttered UI with a lack of meaningful customisation, and the terribly paced, yet bare-bones tutorial make it very frustrating to learn the ropes.

I'm a staunch believer that every game can and should hook you and be fun from the first second, but this one does not make a great first impression. Everyone online seem to recommend sticking it out until it begins to click, and maybe I'll find the patience to do so. People also say to download mods and watch youtube tutorials to imprive the experience and learn the game, which must be a joke, coz that's just a sign of truly obtuse game design.

I can't personally recommend this kind of approach to anyone, when so many other new and old games, civ 5 even, are so much more fun and accessible. 

Tl;dr great fresh ideas undermined by bad onboarding and user interface. More confusing than fun in the first 15h even for an experienced civ player.",1705170959,1705170959,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Players can afford not completely min-maxing their gains, but will be GREATLY rewarded if they do (meaning it’s not 100% necessary to be meticulous if that’s not you).

You can choose (and switch depending on how your game is going) which sort of victory you’d like to aim for (E.g. Science, Culture, Domination, e.t.c.) and suit your style toward it. There are countless leaders to choose from and fight/befriend (more if you buy expansion packs) and the gameplay is sure to be a hit if you love strategy.

NOT ONLY is the strategy fantastic, but the MUSIC AND ART is like no other. This soundtrack is fabulous should you give it the time, and changes depending on the era you’re currently in within a game (each leader/civilization has their own 4 themes for the respective Ancient, Medieval, Industrial and Atomic game-eras) and it is easy to tell the composers did extensive research into cultural and historical motifs with their writing. 

The voice acting and language is beautiful and really gives a great feel for being a diplomatic giant in-game. It’s something special.

All settings can be changed to your liking, but keep in mind Civ games are not generally quick or fast-paced in their extreme forms. Civ6 is a strategy game, so if you’re not into that, or wanting to get into that, it might be better to start somewhere a bit lighter.

I don't think Civ 6 is a game I'd tell people to buy given that there are better choices. If somebody said ""Should I spend $60 on Civ 6?"" I'd say ""No. You should spend a fraction of that and get Civ 4 or 5 (or both) and let that be your first Civ experience.

I've enjoyed every Civ game 1-5, and though they were not always perfect, each had its own appeal for me. So far, Civ 6 has been my first disappointment with the franchise.  Yes, I even liked the notorious 3rd game.

Until Civ 6. 

In this edition, complexity is stacked on complexity simply for its own sake, in the ""worst-of"" mix of Eurogame mechanics without theme. It's as fun as using Excel to model your real life country's economic strategy. It's ""wide over tall"" requirement is only suitable for players who think a Civ game should be 20-40 hours of min-max grinding and extreme micromanagement.

While it's prettier than any previous Civ in terms of overall art quality, I absolutely detest the goofy, cartoon-like leaders and overall aesthetic. One thing I must have from Civ in order to even allow it to be grouped in the legacy is taking the world and its history seriously. Starting with the steroid-inflated arms of swole bro Gilgamesh wearing World of Warcraft bracers shown off right on the store page (as if it's something to be proud of), every choice about style is wrong.

On that note, leaders have bafflingly specific and wordy bonuses that read like terms of service, and often don't seem to have anything to do with one another. More, there's often no thematic consistency between the leaders' personalities (as characters from historical narrative) and their bonuses. Civ 1-5's straightforward leader bonuses were simple in concept but powerful in application.

Barbarians are fewer but reproduce faster and come with better weaponry... insane... which can be fun. The barbarian tribes should not be better equipped than civilizations. 

Less tribal villages and their rewards are nerfed too... 

Districts are an OK addition. 

Workers can be automated with a mod but they aren't as effective... only building a few types of improves and not roads. So now they are annoying too.

Difficulties are skewed to be more difficult. Like the AI expands well at all difficulties even settler. The other leaders annoy you with full screen pops at nearly every turn. With one sentiment or the other.  The Ai should get smarter as you go up in difficulty.  They should be dumb as a post on settler then completely vicious and mercilous on deity... why is that so hard to understand.

The new leaders are boring and not exciting at all, why are there like 4 England Variations while other major countries have no representation, especially with England, France and the US having 3 to 4 leaders while Austria, Denmark, Turkey, Mexico and others have no leader at all.

It's brought back a lot of things I really enjoyed about some other Civ games, such as creating armies out of multiple units, and brought some new things to the table, such as building districts for your cities. However, after playing Civ V, the Civ personalities seem not quite as good, the visuals, policies, governments, and map customization are not my favorite. I would really just recommend playing Civ V. If you want to do have more late game fun in Civ V, SMans World At War mod and associated modpacks are great. In short, Civ VI is not bad, there are some likable things. However, I would just recommend you play V instead of this one. It's just better.


EDIT: I have revisited and played the Rise and Fall ruleset as Julius Caesar. First, Julius Caesar makes it automatically better. I played a game through to the science victory, and I enjoyed it more than the base game rules. There are still a few things I still agree with myself about, like the workers only getting 3 charge, and some new things I wasn't a huge fan of, like just about how the pacing feels off just like in the Civ V game, where the modern era onward feels too fast.

I am very fond of paradox grand strategy games, EUIV probably being my favorite. If I was to describe it in one sentence, I would call it a 'nation roleplaying sandbox game'. Notice how the word strategy was excluded. This does not mean I do not consider that game being part of such genre - the amount of depth and value it can provide is profound. The games biggest strength is the historical flavor that gives you substantial insight into different cultures, religions and events of the era and region that is actually integrated very well into the gameplay itself. Civ 6 can offer plentiful material for keen readers - Civilopedia, which you can open quite quickly and familiarize yourself with trivia on a military unit, world wonder, technological breakthrough or even a policy. What EU IV (and to be fair, no other paradox game) cannot offer, however, is engaging tall/peaceful play. These games are called map painting simulators for a reason - despite thorough work put into making 'passive' gameplay fun, the game ultimately resolves, one way or another, on war. In Civ 6 on the other hand, you can choose not to declare a single war in entire playthrough and have a blast. Questionable for some, but an obvious upgrade from Civ 5 is what they did to cities - it actually requires solid planning, positioning and prioritizing. The district system and wonders occupying a tile to build is merely a surface level aspect of otherwise immensely deep and satisfying part of gameplay - city building.

I am very fond of castle/base building games such as Stronghold Crusader or Age of Empires. As I mentioned, the city building part of civ 6 is truly impressive, requiring you to take into account multiple variables, including visual appeal, dangers of natural disasters (river flooding, sandstorms and droughts) and accessibility of different categories of resources - bonus, strategic, luxury. Of course, the combat of a turn based strategy is incomparable to RTS, yet I want to compliment it under this 'lense' - there is just so much options and layers to seemingly straightforward part of the game that make the aggressive part of 'civilizing process' engaging as well - aircraft, support/siege units, coastal raids, need for previously mentioned strategic resources (good luck fighting modern era wars without oil). That includes also depth regarding war exhaustion, loyalty and potential rebellion. Warmongering might not be as flashy and fun as blowing up castles with horse artillery in AOE3, yet it can offer similar levels of depth regarding combat.

I am very fond of turn based strategy games, Heroes of Might and Magic III being an obvious favorite. I grew up playing this game on hot-seat (multiple people taking turns on one computer) with siblings and friends and now I still play the game online with close ones. The strengths of HoMM are infinite. What I will mention is that civ 6 is nearly just as fun to play with friends in multiplayer. And the (random) map generator that offers so much variety (extended beyond infinity with mods) and different playthroughs that always offer something fresh and engaging.

I am very fond of moddability of the games - both from the point of view as user and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973448849]mod maker[/url] myself. Not only civ 6 is extensively modded, it is extensively moddable. Unlike some games, the changes you can implement can be so fundamental that it can completely change the way you play civ 6 - new victory conditions, complete overhaul of city building and opening of new tactics. That does not mean that the base game is unplayable, of course It's just that modding may eventually become a natural extension of your civ 6 experience, prolonging your enjoyment of it. Truly, nearly everything you can tune and adjust to your liking.

Now let us change green lenses with red tinted ones.

I am very fond of atmosphere and overall [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvH2CPEeIHU]mood[/url] of Civilization 5. I fully understand and agree with players who criticize the aesthetic turn Civ 6 made. While some changes were welcome, the game lost stylishness and vibe of the earlier title. In Civ5, the menus, visuals, music and even color palette set the darker, less saturated but more serious mood. When you met different leaders, not only you interacted with their avatar, but also it felt as if you had an actual audience with them in their throne room in their capital - just compare the meeting of Montezuma with meeting with Pedro of Brazil. Even the soundtrack has severe downgrades - I do not imply that the music itself has worsened, but the diversity of implementation. The cool thing is that civs have music based the era they are in, starting with calm and slow ancient era and transitioning to booming and bustling atomic era tracks (check out Hungary theme). However, the game lost division into peaceful/war music. Yeah, if you are under war or in peace times, the music will not change, unlike civ 5 where it created strong dramatic effect. So did the civ 6 lose the '[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbNsNnLczg4]regional music[/url]', such as additional non-civ tracks that set the mood and helped you immerse with civilization you are playing as. There are plenty of minor things to nitpick, last one I'll mention are the wonders - when you build one in Civ 6, you get the construction animation of the wonder on a tile where it is in the world. In Civ 5, you can a static, but incredibly cool artwork with chilling sound effect and breathtaking [url=https://youtu.be/PubrHoHpWbM?si=s_eivmGYyWqZelUn&t=576]soundtrack[/url] as a follow up with some badass quote. There were instances where I shed a tear in Civ 5, either from [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgPDqcsLI58]BNW main theme[/url] and intro, wonder scenes or simply due to emotionally moving [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULgtHjLmb9Y]music[/url]. In civ 6, I did not even once.

I am, as EVERY player, fond of difficulty and *strategy* in a strategy game. And in turn based one, the difficulty is less so measured in reflexes and reaction as it is in planning and outsmarting. Naturally, you would expect that the harder you set the difficulty of the game, the harder it should be to outsmart the enemy. And here is the fundamental problem of the game that may be enough for you to say 'no': you cannot make AI smarter (even mods cant help much), only give them cheats. You cannot make AI play better, you can give them extra units, resources and percentages (+20% science, culture etc) at the start of the game. In other words, you give them cheats, not brains. While in singleplayer games this can be a profound issue, in multiplayer they function quite well in the role of passenger - instead of offering viable competition, they serve as dynamic entities for real players to interact with - trade, fight, make alliances. This way the AI no longer becomes a major issue for me as I 99% of the time play with friends or siblings.

These are the lenses I see civ 6 with. You may find different shiny spots to praise or smelly stains to spit on, but for me, this is among the greatest strategy games I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. With so much still left to talk about - unique great people, unique city states, outstanding government mechanics, fleshed out victory types, etc - I'll just conclude the review with statement: Yes, and I like it better than Civ 5 (except vibe, of course).",1477767275,1704747408,True,2,0,0.53562009334564209,0,True,False,False

But while has imperfections, but it's still one of my most played strategy games ever. You can use mods to get around the issues that it has.

I've played this game 1300+ hours (yes, very pathetic) and I have a love/hate relationship with it. I've played Civ versions for over 20 years now and really think for the 6th version there are several things that should be better. 

The most annoying thing about this version of the game is are the natural disasters and rising waters. They really messed this up as it's so silly and predictable. I just turn off all disasters and it's fine but the rising waters is so pathetic. Hey its the 1500's, and the water is rising. By the 1600's the water has risen 3meters and there's nothing you can do! You can literally lose 1/3 of your land territory if you're on an island based map. The Dutch first reclaimed land in the 1200's but this game thinks we need Computer technology to mitigate rising waters? And it doesn't matter how much Science you focus on, the years it happens will just come earlier. Plus with some smaller cities that are younger and not such a big population, I've had it take over 100 turns for my flood barrier but I can 1 click create a tunnel in a mountain or create a ski resort. Stupid! 

The game play itself can get very repetitive so when the 'Future Tech/Civ' boxes pop up late game for EVERY TURN, you're ready to smash your screen. That plus the setting up of Trade routes if you get attacked or start a war. There have been games where I had over 200 trade routes and if you get into a war (everyone attacks you) You have to set up those trade routes again ONE BY ONE! That plus the Governor upgrades that come in every turn even though they're all maxed out. You have to go to the governor screen every single turn. 

There's also no 'repeat' button to click for your production. So if you have 20 cities and it's late game, I typically just 'Carbon Recapture' for most of my cities. So you can load 8 items in the 'queue' x 20 cities. So you're clicking literally 160 times every 8 turns. I've had games with 50+ cities, that's hundreds of unnecessary clicks. They could EASILY have a 'Repeat' button to click and boom, that's sorted. 

There are other parts of the game that are super annoying so thank goodness for the workshop with some fixes. There's a housing and amenity one that is great to get rid of the loyalty issues. Theres an awesome one that gives you what's called a 'Reserve' and you can accumulate all strategic resources from Horses, Iron up to Uranium. This allows you to have 1 resource per turn per city so you can get enough to play but not a crazy amount. This actually makes the game much more fun to play. 

Another gripe is that the interface is all over the screen. When you're dealing with 10/20/30+ cities and just grinding through, you are literally clicking all over your screen from corner to corner. I really don't know why they can't have the clickable area all in the same place? Like when some other civ makes a trade request you have to literally click on 3 parts of the screen. You click the 'goodbye' button on the bottom left hand side but then you have to go up to the top right corner to X out of the screen? When you're playing with 7 other civs this can get so draining. 

It's hard to explain but I feel like the difficulty scaling is very tough. I can be at Prince (standard setting) and then go up to the next one and everything is so much more intense it's just not fun. Like at Prince you can manage things fine and it's almost kinda easy and boring so you go up to the next level then all of your opponents gang up on you it can be frustrating in a way. 

So yeah, I'm writing this just as I will uninstall the game. 1300+ hours is stupid. But I've played every civ a few times and won on Diety 2x (but I had to restart and save and go back) so I'm satisfied with getting enough wins. 

I'm not sure what they have in store for 7 but they really need to get the basics (stuff I mentioned above) better otherwise it's just a waste of time and money. They might come up with more gimmicks like say Klaus Schwab and the WTO or incorporate a pandemic feature lol. But I honestly really love the game, I'm sitting here typing this review out reconsidering uninstalling haha. 

The core of the game is great but they've added things (the amount of civs to play as/against is great) that don't make for a more enjoyable experience. I have this with the new Gran Turismo 7. GT4 was much better but we all still want the newest version. So Civ 6 is not the best version of this game. I think maybe it was 4 or 5? But if you are into this turn based style of game Civ is still on top.

I will admit that I was at first hesitant because I was so religiously devoted to Civ V, but over time this game warmed up to me. The game runs smoothly and many of the new systems are enjoyable, and I personally now prefer it to Civ V. 

Some noteworthy changes I liked:

-The addition of ""quests"" in the form of Eurekas and Inspirations was clever and makes the game a bit more active and less of an end-turn button masher while also rewarding you for being proactive.

-The city district system is very unique and makes city construction much more interesting. It also feels like city placement and management matters more in this game than in Civ V.

-I enjoy that social policies are researched now similar to sciences. The government system that goes hand-in-hand with this also allows for a lot of freedom and customization.

-The diplomatic victory is admittedly a bit overpowered and too easy to get, however the diplomatic system as a whole matters much more and is more fun. Voting in the World Congress feels more meaningful, and this combined with the more nuanced alliance system makes diplomacy more interesting. Oftentimes in Civ V it felt like diplomacy would always become a bribery contest.

-Religion is not just a meme. It is actually a very legitimate way to play the game, and even if you do not attempt a religious victory Faith is still much more powerful than it was in Civ V.

-Happiness still matters (now in the form of ""Amenities"") but it is not as insanely punishing to have low Amenities (Happiness) as it was in Civ V. 

-Gandhi still nukes people. Some things never change!",1704511827,1704511827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

8/10. 

Domination isn't really a thing for the AI, on Prince you rarely get attacked. Which is a drastic change from how Civ V AI Players worked, since even on lower difficulties you'd still get demolished by the computers early on.

Natural wonders wait to be discovered and settled to add boosts to your empire. Wonders wait to be built to gain an edge over your competitors, there are many with land requirements that cannot be seen through the fog of war. City states provide awesome bonuses to their suzerains, especially after their 6th envoy - find those sweet little treasure nuggets and hold them close, lest your enemies swipe them from under your nose....or burn them to the ground.

If I didn't know the games, and someone showed me footage from both games, I would immediatelly decide that civ V is the newer game. Civ VI looks like a mobile game. Why would I want to pay extra to play a mobile game instead of the proper PC version, which is civ V? Graphics don't define a game, but you can sure tell things aren't well when a game looks worse than its predecessor.

The tutorial is horrible, most of it is just flavour text (in tiny font on higher resolutions, and for font scaling - ""only some resolutions are supported""). Doesn't allow  you to click anything, and I don't mean choices, I mean anything, settings, views, what to show, what to hide, besides the pop-up message button or when there isn't one, whatever the arrow is pointing, so of course you learn nothing. You wonder what this button does - you can't find out, because you can't click it. 

So this game doesn't make any sense as long as civ V is around. But hey, if you like politics shoved down your throat while playing a game, it has climate change and CO2 levels!

It is not difficult to play it, but it is recommended to give a look to some simple and fast tutorial if you never played games as complex as this one (Hoi4 is more complex by the way).

One of my favourite aspects is the fact we can select real world places map, such as Europe, the world, ecc. and you can also choose if all civilisations will start from their historical geographical origin (example: If you play as the Romans, you will start in Italy if you wish).
It is recommended to play it with friends if you often opt for multiplayer mod in others games.

Expansions+purchase suggestions:
That said, there are many expansions packets which are worth to try (the ambient disasters and diplomatic ones are my favourites) but I recommend to buy them WITH the game as well, when they are in special offer (example: I bought the game + ALL expansions mod packets for just €24,85 instead of €209 around the period of 1-4 January), so if you are interested to buy the game with all expansions packets mod I suggest you to control very often when there are these kind of special offers.
If you are interested of buying just the game, you can wait for a special offer period (my brother bought it for just €5 instead of €60 around 1-4 January)
NOTE: Remember the periods with special offers/discounts could be present in different periods respectively of the previous ones I mentioned (as much as I know) and/or have different prices respectively the prices I mentioned previously.

Conclusion: 
If you (kind of) like history and complex strategy games, or just having fun to develop a civilisation along time with friends, Civilization VI is definitely a game to try in my opinion.

Perhaps it is the detailed game play loop that always leaves me patiently waiting for the next building to finish or the next war to be over.

Civ 6, I believe, is the highest standard of game play you can find in the series. The districts add so much complexity to planning out your civilization. There is nothing more satisfying than finally placing that tri-city entertainment complex-theater square mega complex.

On top of that, the developer company sold me an update that not only does not run on my platform, but also makes the whole base game unplayable. Now, after the full update to the Anthology, where the Leader Pass stated will run on Linux by the way, the game not just does not start, but it even refuses to launch on compatibility modes of Proton. Ofc, I do not want a refund, as this game was working fine without the last update. As the last update stated it will run om Linux, otherwise I even would not see the item in my filtered purchase list, I would expect the developers to fix the issue and the game should run on linux smoothly before the company starts to work on any other product, they should not to even think about a Civilization 7 before it is fixed.

The barbarian system is also Ridiculous in older Civ games if you lost to barbarian hordes it was a complete skill issue however in Civ 6 they are extremely OP it is completely normal to see a barbarian camp produce 5 horsemen and 3 horse archers in the first 20 turns and then pop out of the fog of war and siege your capital, you cant reliably counter this since you dont get walls, archers, or spears, until late dark age and you end up getting locked in gay baby jail forever while the AI surpasses you in tech and you just get gimped. the Tech system with the new research districts when combined with map generation issues also just completely takes the skill out of your hands when building for a science game since its completly RNG based whether or not you get a decent science location and if you do 9 times out of 10 the before mentioned barbarian hordes will just raze the district and sit on it while they besiege you completely locking you out of science and the whole game for the first hundred turns while you slowly widdle them down.",1704208972,1704208972,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False

As a strategy lover myself, I absolutely adore civilization VI. My friend got me into playing,
and I was amazed about all the mechanics the game had.

The graphics are absolutely stunning, and the game comes with multiplayer features. Having
a few buddies, and playing the game is an absolute blast.

I absolutely recommend buying the game. Even though it may be a bit pricey, it is worth the money.

Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI Anthology is a beautifully designed and fun game that offers hours of entertainment for fans of the series. With its excellent graphics, intricate mechanics, and varied game-play options, this game is sure to provide an enjoyable experience for players.

One of the most impressive aspects of the game is its stunning visual design. The landscapes are intricately detailed, and the cities are beautifully rendered, making the game a joy to explore. The art style is colorful and vibrant, truly capturing the spirit of exploration and discovery that is at the heart of the Civilization series.

The game's design is also top-notch. The mechanics of the game are complex, but they are presented in a way that is easy to understand and follow. The game provides a variety of options for players to explore, from diplomacy and trade to warfare and cultural development. The game's technology tree is vast, providing players with a sense of progression and achievement as they advance through the ages.

While the game is undeniably fun to play, it does have its drawbacks. The limited multiplayer support is a significant issue, as the game's multiplayer mode has limited stability. This can be disappointing for players who enjoy playing with larger groups of people. Additionally, there are occasional issues with multiplayer connections, which can disrupt the flow of the game.

Another drawback of the game is the lack of online features. While players can connect with other players through the multiplayer mode, there are no online features such as leader-boards or matchmaking. This can make it difficult for players to find other players to play with and can limit the social aspect of the game.

Perhaps the most significant drawback of the game is the mindless AI. While the game's AI is intelligent and capable of making smart decisions, it is not as formidable as it should be. The game's enemies are not aggressive or strategic enough, and they often make decisions that are easy to predict. This makes the game less challenging and can diminish the sense of accomplishment that players feel when they win.

Despite these issues, Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI Anthology is an excellent game that is sure to please fans of the series. The game's beautiful design and fun game-play make it an enjoyable experience for players. The game's single-player mode is particularly engaging, providing players with a deep and immersive experience that will keep them coming back for more.

In conclusion, Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI Anthology is a well-designed and enjoyable game that has a few flaws. The game's limited multiplayer support, multiplayer connection issues, lack of online features, and mindless AI may be disappointing for some players. However, the game's stunning visuals, complex mechanics, and varied game-play options make it a must-play for fans of the series. Despite its flaws, Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI Anthology is a game that is sure to provide hours of entertainment for players of all skill levels.

I don't know all the OP combinations possible but I have been dabbling with Egypt and building epic Floodplain bases, and sometimes if you get a good map with lots of floodplains and good resources on them, combined with Sphinx, it's completely OP, so I can imagine tons of interesting and crazy combinations with districts and setups exist.

In addition, a game takes quite a long time (~10 hours for a normal speed game).

My favourite being that once you purchase the game you aren't bombarded by micro-transactions. I decided to pick this game up because I saw the crazy 90% discount and had heard good things about it.

And don’t forget the mods! There are some really great UI mods without which I can’t play anymore.
As well as a lot of just little mods and completely game changing mods which should be in the game but aren’t.

I clocked 59 hours and I only just bought it (on sale for $5.99) a couple of days ago. It's the days leading up to New Years so not much is going on. I did the tutorial, which sadly, you can't save and is rather long but I'm pretty sure I didn't finish it and my game froze from leaving my laptop open. I started a new game and chose a leader at random and got Ghandi. I've enjoyed it so much that, even though I lost a cultural war to Cleopatra, I've  kept on playing just to see what happens. The mechanics aren't that difficult. It's more about the strategy and keeping up with everyone else. You're leader is apparently immortal because I'm currently in an era where I can now build submarines, machine guns, and artillery and can research nuclear power (which I'm currently working on).  I'm not sure which age I'm in. That part is a bit confusing for me. I did unlock Democracy, at any rate. 
I totally recommend this game if, like me, you've been apprehensive about trying a turn-based empire building game. It's gorgeous, especially when you zoom in on the map and get the animations. The soundtrack is beautiful, at times haunting. My husband has been appreciating it just from being in the same room while I play.",1704030754,1704030754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They took Civ 5 which is my personal favorite and somehow made it better.

I've played hundreds of hours on the switch and other accounts and can honestly say this is one of the best drugs the universe has ever given me. 

There is a bit of a learning curve and the game can be very in depth but if you're starting don't worry too much. Just click your way through and remember some of the good clicks for next time.

I got around to buy all of it, even the arguably unnecessary DLCs for me and the wive (on a good discount, though), maybe to satisfy my inner hunter/gatherer. We like to play on map size: large, difficulty: immortal, random leader each. Recently, we discovered the extended eras mod:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2123444827

Basically, research and cultural progress on marathon speed while production remains standard speed. This way, the end game stays more interesting. Without the mod, you barely get to enjoy infantry, tanks and airplanes because technological progress is just too fast. The mod extends the fun without the weirdness of marathon speed in vanilla.

I think Civ IV introduced religion, but they didn't dare to put distinguishing features into those, at the time. Civ V introduced hexagons and the one-unit-per-tile principle, both great additions. Civ VI introduced **districts**, the full-blown loyalty mechanism (in one of the add-ons), the independent tree of cultural progress (civ V had something quite similar, though), an unparalleled number of leaders with actual distinct characteristics and corresponding play-style. Also Civ VI has great mechanics for Great People and gives use to faith points even if you don't care for religion in your game.

Somewhere between Civ III and VI they turned diplomacy with AI players into something interesting. Probably the most important changes happened in Civ VI. The different ways to declare war in order to avoid being the bad guy are a great model of real international politics: Declaring war without properly denouncing the other nation in due time? You are a war criminal. - Oh! You denounced them 5 turns ago? My bad, let's kill the bad guy together.

I don't know which part of the series introduced aircraft carriers - maybe they were around since always. It is still my personal highlight to produce these in order to bomb cities at the other end of the world and conquer them. The logistics of it accurately reflect some real-life modern warfare.

All in all, Civ in its latest version remains the genre-defining game. I never tried Humankind, but its aggregated reviews amount only to ""mixed"", so I haven't yet bothered to check it out.

(I will also for ever remember the mod ""Fall from heaven"" for Civ IV ... just spectacular. So in terms of mods and add-ons, technically Civ VI hasn't even reached its full potential)",1703975996,1703975996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Problems will only become apparent after more than a hundred hours into the game. To sum up, seasoned veterans will lament how the world seed and AI progression delivers a somewhat on-rails experience, meaning creativity is sometimes stifled because that's not how the game wants you to play and theyve already planned for this in the scripting and the seed generation. 

Where you start every game has already been calculated by seed balancing to ensure equal strengths over the course of the game so sometimes its noticable when you veer of that track how the game limits you. So trying to settle in lands 'you're not supposed to' can make unrealistic barbarian hostility, or settling near a natural wonder far from your capital will make other civs hostile to you, or just accidently roaming the seas and uncovering land that is good for settling where the AI could have settled but have not yet but would give you an advantage to settle there will cause the AI to aggressively settle there like their maps show where you've explored. Many things like that......

Overall a very accomplished title in the series, yet one hopes the developers dont fall over each other trying to deliver a balanced consensus of a game as Civ Vi represents an evolution of the formula clearly taking inspirations from the feedback from the game and its players over time, lest it become contrived in its purposes and not find its roots in being a groundbreaking title.",1703854709,1703856737,True,68,3,0.854456305503845215,0,True,False,False

Edit: It's been out for years and has several significant DLC.  It's still poop.  They haven't fixed many little things that bother me, like lack of hotkeys for moving your units and incorrect pathing indication.  The roads are so slow that by the time you get your cutting edge units to a non-neighbour enemy, it's the next age and your units are obsolete.

Edit 2: It's been 4 years since my last edit.  This game is old enough that it should load much faster than new games.  It doesn't.  Then after all the booting sequence for the game is done, there are still unskippable animations for the studio/publisher.  And now, as if the ads on the launcher weren't enough, there are what seem to be ads IN THE MAIN MENU.  We need more developers like Larian and fewer like 2K/Firaxis.

Maybe I'm an old, impossible to please, curmudgeonly gamer now, maybe I'm no longer the target audience, but in my opinion, the big changes made in Civ 6 have made the game less enjoyable overall. A couple of examples that come to mind after a dozen hours of gameplay: I could overlook the overly bright colors and cartoonish visuals if the UI was better organized, but I find the explored-but-not-currently-in-view areas are harder to discern than the fog of war style of the predecessors. Civ 6's civilopedia is written in a style that is less scholarly, more cynical, and several clicks away to find the entry to the technology you just gained. It doesn't resonate well with me. The card system of civic policies is busy and gets in the way of actual gameplay, because new ones are made available at such a rapid pace.

Desyncs and crashes have returned.  Couldn't even get through games anymore

*editing in 2021*

So I wanted to update this and switch it to a thumbs up, they have since fixed whatever multiplayer bug was causing so many crashes in multiplayer as I talk about in the older negative review below.  Now that it doesn't crash every single multiplayer run...it is great.  It does still sometimes have desyncs but they are rare and dont cause a loss of a turn or a crash.  Basically only if it is a huge map and late game or something along with the internet being awful.  Unfortunate it took until basically this last year to actually get fully playable but I guess better late than never.  Here is hoping civ 7 doesn't have that problem.


( old review in 2019)

Love these games.  This one is no different.  The expansions lean into it even more.  Things are typical civ.  It is really turning into a great game.  However, this game getting a ton less play time.  Why?  Well it does this damned desync thing no matter what me and my civ partner try.  Lan, internet, full screen, windowed, graphics up, graphics down, doesn't matter.  If it doesn't desync and waste a ton of time.  Then it tends to crash.  Less for me really.  I can do solo games no problem but in multi someone seems to be desynced or crashing all the time.  Sometimes you can get a game to keep going if it is small or tiny map.  This isn't a baby game.  We are now on the 2nd major content release for the 6th game.  It can't be crashing in multi.  Across multiple computer builds too.  Its not an uncommon problem.

So ya know.  Still fun but careful if you want to play with friends cause it is going to be a hassle.  Always civ 5 to play though.

Either way a civ game getting a not recommended from me is crazy but I expend most of my hours playing with a small section of friends and it is a problem.  It is at 1/3 played time from civ 5.",1550554454,1703656388,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The UI is ugly and unintuitive as well and the minimalism isn't minimalistic but rather just seems lazy with a lot less detail in UI which is in stark contrast to the detailed UI present in CIV 5. Policy mechanics try too hard to be balanced which fail miserably in comparison to CIV 5 and civics vs techs are weird.  unlike civ 5 also, you can just build holy places and happiness is overhauled by loyalty which once again is a stupid feature.

I do not want to know what this game was like in its original version but it is not worth buying even with all the addons. If there were no other Civ games this one might be ok but in comparison it feels like half a game.

One major issue is the bonuses you acquire throughout the game. They are as impactful as the bonuses on weapons in an MMORPG. Get one extra gold on full moons if the name of the building starts with an ""a"" and does not give you more than three other bonuses... Even though this should be a beginner's problem it does not get better with more hours of gameplay. Just build whatever you like and hope that the bonuses somehow add up in combination with the surroundings you discover and the decisions you make.

I missed a lot of features from earlier games but founding new cities has always been a key concept from my point of view. Unfortunately founding new cities is reduced to a handful due to missing space. To develop a big city in Civ6 you need a lot of space. But even on a huge map with reduced number of city states and AIs there is very little space from the beginning.

I could add many more details but to summarize it - I prefer the previous Civs and this one is closer (and inferior) to Age of Wonders.",1703525051,1703525051,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

For more than just one or two versions of the game, Instead of re-estimating what IMPACT things like policies should have on ANY civilisation, CIV's dev. team has refused to make a 1/2 decent debate-space in which to USE or UTILISE their fanbase to iron out what-should-cause-what, AFTER releasing what new measurement & game-dynamic systems they want to make.

In other words ;

1  releasing what points-systems, ARE, will interact with, will be able to influence, etc,

2  Collecting opinion / constructive-criticism from a forum or something ON them,
3  THEN re-tweaking it & THEN making the alpha & playtesting it,

Instead, each new one has new director/s or designer/s, & whoever they are they keep changing base-dynamics, instead of having made reliably flexible / adjustable ones from the start, & only tweaking / reSCALING numbers & factors.

ex in CIV 6 ;
the defence bonus from terrain.

It's not long, before the str-bonus is useless for anything other than movement, &-yet units like anti-cavalry, should be able to COMBINE-with-terrain to get MORE of a combination-effect IN terrain suited for blocking horse-units, or artillery should be able to defend hills/adjacent-to-mountains.

i.e.  a BROAD range of multipliers, rather than consistent-for-ALL units or whole-types.

In CIV 2,
OK, you're talking about their 2nd chance to've,

CIV 3, they really should've started to,
4, 5, 6... they're STILL not doing it? ffs.

---

Other belligerent problems include ;

still no military-unit stacking / complications, like logistics being needed for SUPPLY both inside & outside of one's territory, instead just  'gold'  somehow 'pays' for it.

That's supposed to work through communist /anti-capitalism religious territory?

Their 'defence' explanations like, that corruption in a communism would make smuggling possible, from supposed neglect of income / luxuries of soldiers/enforcers within,

yet in another argument, CIV defends simplifies that strict, limiting, disciplined government types, DO-succeed, at creating fanaticism and/or devotion to a SYSTEM,
instead of the near-absence OF one, such as free-markets have, or un-differentiating dem.s gamble on - criminals get the vote, too-young or too-old/mentally-ill to, etc

---

A bit like the simplification of concepts we in-reality use,
to 'defend' (avoid) the by-product of such neglect,

CIV-neglects,

FACING the reality of things like that communisms as-well-as other devoted-types, should deny the normal supply-line to units in enemy territory,

OR, that DURING incursions, population should move, cultural borders should be temporarily affected or suspended, so that the incurSORs movement through controlled territory is IMMEDIATE.

Thats one that even American-civil-war-obsessed tabletopers agree on - somehow without any means to, your  'culture' or borders impede all military units movement, while the UN-developed wild speeds them up?

And compared to the logic of bridges being destroyed?

i.e.  Bridges YES,..

developed terrain (especially roads) ... NO.  Partial or almost-no effect - saboteurs would have to be prrrrrety well equipped to synchronously destroy an entire hex's roads in an instant.

Yet NEITHER do the roads disappear, when you can't use them, despite having effective control as-you-go.

---

Having to make a new play/game -dynamic for HOW that works, might take some time,
but it has been necessary literally 40 years now.

Sigh.

Obsession with hexes instead of octagons (best for diagonals & cardinals),
ooo they're Chinese?

They're NOT Chinese, & hexagons aren't owned by anyone EITHER.

---

A bit like that, bias & self-obsessions are still in the game.
It avoids ANCIENT-democracy & what it was like with no-women,
and natural-democracy,

rather than ONLY modern, despite the irony of the Electoral-college fundamentally NON-democratic power-OVER,.. the 'people power' or 'rule OF the people'
i.e. what democracy IS, we're to trust-Americans?

---

Avoiding corruption is also absurd, it should never've been removed from the game,
& as globalism progresses free-markets should be affected by it MORE,

unlike the absurd all-game-long simplification from CIV 1 / 2.

---

etc

Still needs a massive overhaul & FACING REALITY honest approach,

rather than downloadable micro-transaction crap like obscure civilisations requiring kids in parts of the world where currency-exchange makes buying the game expensive in the first place, let alone a SECOND purchase, just to be able to play your local civ.  Mother comes-looking for her baby's-tears, America.

Firaxis/CIV, has been WARNED about changing the numbers too much EACH time, without COMPLETING ENOUGH civ.s' stats to include in the default purchase, before.  This is NOT the first time they have had civ bias & claimed a consumer-base justification-by-numbers.

---

If that kind of unfair playing-environment shits you,
then do NOT buy or play this game.

Democracy's patriarchal / educated-classes  non-universal-suffrage  to-vote, is avoided,

Absences of things like the development of complicating fracturing-of religion like (Protest)antism, needing to OCCUR, in real-time (& with Rome EXISTING - i.e. no-rome = no protesting-their power-grab/abuses), rather than somehow being  past-tense,

are still everywhere, & the creators of the game have chosen to OVER-spend on gimmicks instead of knuckling-down & including everything that should be there.

Nukes are ofc still-obsessively there, instead of being optional, & other sub-atomic-particle sci-fi utilisation is avoided als

ex ;
A more complicated utilisation of MAGNETISM, for things other-than navigation, early on, for instance, is entirely feasable / plausable,

but not-even China / Korea / Japan, can do ANYthing, with it, other than sail.

*yawwwwwn*
sad.

40 years later, J-Christians still obsessed with themselves, & still no better than-in civ 1, in that regard.
Beyond stubborn.

I only bought this because it was 90% off,
& because i wanted to see the new  'pantheon'  system,

& what do i find?
As soon as i'm choosing my first one, in nothing but the tutorial,
i'm selecting,..

... a grand-TOTAL,
of 1 god.
Wow.  what a pantheon.  look out.

ONE.

sorrrt of misses the POINT? Firaxis?
Deliberate.

still waiting to play this game until the expansions go on sale because it's not a full game without them..
come on Sid.. influence and having towns rebel should have been in the base game.. 

that's been in every civ game since the franchise began 
I started with Civ I
how are you going to take content that's been in the game since it started and charge us for it?
two thumbs down
will wait another 5 years for your next game to go on sale too

Ok.. so Finally own most of the expansions a year later.. they say it wasn't rushed.. still bummed about core parts of the Franchise being Pay to Play now. I guess the unit packs and leaders weren't selling, but here we are releasing Babylon. Finally. I hope it's good.. I don't know think I'll give it a whirl soon, only missing a pretty large leader pack expansion, so far the game play style is still sort of a miss. The 3D was sort of cool at first and I am just not sure where it went wrong. I feel like the map packs could be getting better by now.

Districts and Governors give you greater control over the map and customization/specialization for your cities, and playing wide is much less punishing than Civ V, so filling up the map or grabbing resources with a settler don't tank your game.

That said, here is why this review is negative.
The game has had consistent ""support"" in the form of DLCs (some of which are free, to be fair) since release, but:

[b]a) Core functionality I expected, that prompted me to buy the game in the first place, is still missing.[/b]

I bought this game so I could relax and play it on the couch, with a controller. It was a headache to get it working on controller + TV for various reasons (no controller support, UI scaling is locked at 1080p, etc) despite fact that there are actual ports for all major consoles. There's no crossplay, so even if I had a console version I could not play with people on PC. This game was heavily advertised alongside the Steam Controller, which I own, but does not have real controller support. I eventually just gave up trying to use it as a couch game. It's honestly infuriating that console ports exist but basic controller UI is totally unavailable in the PC version.

[b]b) The game is unstable when run with all content enabled, because it attempts to load [i]everything[/i] in the game rather than just what is actively being used.[/b]

The game engine has a limit to the number of assets that can be loaded. It doesn't matter if those assets are actually [i]used[/i], if too many packages are enabled it will crash as soon as you launch a new game. I like to play with mods, and even just a few UI mods will now reliably crash the game because they have pumped so many DLCs into it without bothering to fix the core engine - meaning the game itself is near its own asset limit now. Of course you can disable DLCs, but I really shouldn't have to disabled paid content just to add a few units or change a few textures.",1668643234,1703185723,False,2,0,0.522216379642486572,0,True,False,False

Your opponents look like kids. Drawing is not even goofy more like childish drawings. It takes all seriousness from it.

Game punishes you for trying to take military path to victory. If you decide to conquer your opponents by force that means building siege units, range units, melee units and you need a lot. While you do all this your opponents double down on economy, technology, culture and religion. All these traits lead can lead to victory. In conclusion while you fight another opponent you just lose because you are never going to make it in time. If you pick the winning condition to be only military conquest it becomes the most dull and boring game. The AI in this game is god awful no matter what difficulty you pick. Enemy units will keep going close to your fortress and hit random buildings but not focus on the unit that is actually damaging them. I got declared war on me multiple times where the enemy did not bother to bring any siege units and the fights were completely one sided and It was an effortless win.

If you decide to pick any other traits like technology, culture or religion it becomes a building simulator where you just build and press end turn. 

Oh and If you want to play campaign, think again there is none. Only skirmish vs terribly programmed AI.
Save your time and money, I regret spending any time on this and the few euros I spent. Overall a very bad experience.

Although I haven't had much hands-on experience myself, I have observed others playing the game on several occasions. It is a game that can easily occupy a few hours of your time, as there is always something new to discover and explore.

One of the things that I appreciate about Sid Meier's Civilization VI is how simple it is to pick up the basics. The game provides a tutorial mode that guides you through the initial steps, making it easy for beginners to understand the mechanics and objectives. This allows newcomers like myself to dive right into the game and start having fun, even without prior experience.

While it is true that there is a lot more to learn in order to take the game to the next level, this does not diminish the enjoyment that can be found by just grasping the basics. There are numerous strategies and tactics to master, different civilizations to play as, and various victory conditions to achieve. This depth and complexity add layers of challenge and excitement to the gameplay, keeping players engaged and wanting to explore more.

Even if you can't dedicate a significant amount of time to learning every aspect of the game, you can still find enjoyment in Sid Meier's Civilization VI by simply grasping the basics. The game offers different difficulty levels, allowing players to adjust the challenge according to their skill level and available time. Whether you have just a few minutes or a few hours to spare, you can still have a fulfilling gaming experience by focusing on the fundamentals.

In conclusion, while I may be relatively inexperienced in playing games like Sid Meier's Civilization VI, I have found it to be an enjoyable and immersive experience. The game is easy to pick up and provides hours of entertainment. There is certainly more to learn in order to take your gameplay to the next level, but even if you only grasp the basics, you can still find enjoyment and fulfillment in playing this captivating strategy game.",1703076960,1703076960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It really is showing it's age, and how are there still silly bugs after all these years of dev work and updates and no ""undo"" for when the graphics show your units are miles apart and you click on the wrong one?

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

This is not an over-exaggeration. Released on many different platforms, the devs have made a game accessible for everyone without it being a cheap money grab without a care for graphics, updates or even the player base.
The graphics are exceptional, little unlock cinematics, watch your troops fight. Life is in every moment in this game.
The music is brilliant, ambient for relaxing play but enough to engage and not be annoying.
The game play is on another level: so many intricacies and areas to master without being overwhelming to a new player. The tutorial allows you to get straight into the game, starting from the beginning. Researching and building is realistic while maintaining a turn based aesthetic.
I bought the Anthology Bundle, allowing full access to all DLCs, I would usually expect them to be awful however I found that the DLCs unlocked the entire game, providing a better experience. Not to mention new ways to win and new leaders to experience. [Although there is no Napoleon :( ]

Overall, this game is worth it for hours of fun, games take a meaningful amount of time (I spent 30 hrs on one game) however this time doesn't drag on. Every minute is full of fun and pleasure from this game.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Warfare, Ah yes you might hate it a bit, Now you might ask ""Why?"" now listen moving 1 tile is not very fun. So if you are looking for some GOOD warfare I might sugest civ 5 and humankind I have tried both and theirs warfare seems quite better than civ 6 one

Not perfect, But some people can enjoy it.
Great city builder not a good historical game.
Bad warfare but some people might find it intreasting
Grapchics are good but some people call it ""Mobile""",1702907121,1702929092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why my great civilization sending missions to Mars doesn't have space to store paintings?

Why it takes hundreds of years to build a district?

Why are cities (and districts) so disproportionally huge comparing to world map?

Why my huge mega-city can't build a new district on or work the 4th tile [which obviously belongs to it]? Yet how do you get resources from it if nobody works it??

Why you can't move districts? How is oil extracted from under your university?

Why are barbarians having technologies which take civilizations hundreds of years of research? Where do they get oil from to have infantry?

Why you can raze cities but can't raze districts?

Why can't you just remove districts you haven't discovered yet from captured cities?

Why you can't trade territories with other civs (e.g. buy a tile from them)?

Why liberating (restoring) a city-state suddenly moves your unites from its borders (normally closer to the position of your enemy - the one you liberated it from)? Same for protectorate war and enemy units.

Why your great people can live for hundreds/thousands years? Why you can send them clearing barbarian outposts? (I had Homer clear not one but two - with help obviously).
Why is there no option to ask my alliance partner not to attack my vassal with a ton of envoys?

Why you can't repair improvements of your alliance partners?

Why you can't give a city of your enemy to your alliance partner?

Why you can't produce earlier military units in later eras (if tight on gold or lack resources)?

Why cost of building stuff increases with each era? It's supposed to be the other way.

Why you can't trade food within your own empire (without ""traders"" mechanics with stupid limit - I just wanna send some food from my huge capital to my little town in taiga without crippling my international trade)?

Why can't your units pass through city center of friendly civilization (example: Istanbul on Mediterranean TSL blocking passage from Asia to Europe)?

Why can't your apostle [as Kongo] ""heal and repair"" in Holy Sites of his religion?

[b]UPD:[/b]

Why is AI so bad that you can easily beat Prince on Standard map with only one city? (Obviously can be done on harder difficulties on smaller maps).

Why are there 8 (eight) difficulties in this game with only 1-3 of them playable (under certain conditions)?

Why do you have to invent challenging ways to play this game because of how AI sucks?
Seriously, why-why-why is AI is so outstandingly bad? You can't make worse AI even if you try.

Why is the game after 10 years of development still so lacking in hotkeys department? Hotkey for yields, hello? (I ended up making one in Autohotkey, of course).

Why isn't there a way to display/sort list of cities with production - i.e., collapsable yields list, without details per building.

Why isn't there a proper list of units (technically there is a very awkward one)?

Why isn't there an option to mute certain notifications?
How about stopping AI bothering you with certain type of trades?
How about auto-extending option for trade routes and alliances?

Why can't you open borders with city-states in early game (maybe for a fee)?

Why is AI luxury resource buying price like 10 times higher than his selling price? Sell one resource for 300 gold and buy another for 30. It's broken. The ""professional"" strategy to settle on luxury and sell it to AI is straight broken BS and should be patched out.

Why disasters hurt military units but do not hurt civilians?

Why you can't kill civilians with ranged fire (war crime and diplomatic penalty)?

Why captured city-states don't go back to city-state status after another civ loses them on loyalty and you refuse them?

Why are there no options to auto-extend friendships and deals?

Why isn't neutralized governor re-assigned to his city automatically?

Why so much tedious micromanagement?

Why is its sound in my earphones (!) so loud that it woke up my girlfriend?

ONE MORE TURN lives on.

I am glad the 2K launcher ain't that sh*t no more, new DLCs are great, and community of this game is the best.

******OLD REVIEW:

I'll be honest, game was 5/10 tops, Civ5 was better. Lucky for this game, its DLC saved the enjoyment of its players, which pave way to a more positive rating.

Until they decided to patch up their messy launcher, it made Civ 6 turning into total sh*tshow, pardon my French.

Pros...tons of civs to play, good DLCs, different strategies to win, an excellent modding community. Pick the game up when there is a sale. You will get tons of playtime out of this game.

Cons....of course all games have them. This game does suffer from issues with multiplayer and some tedium once you have started to snowball in the game, but winning feels all too good after you have sent your armies to conquer the world.",1702636105,1702636105,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every single game in my Steam library can be played with friends, with the exception of this game. This is the only game that doesn't work. I've spent probably hundreds of hours trying to work around the de-sync issues to play with friends. The netcode is just so unbelievably poor. It's so unacceptable for a game that's commercialized as well as this one has. I know of no other game that works as poorly as this one. I expect they will never fix it now, they have had so long and the quality of the matchmaking & netcode is worse than any other digital experience I know of.

Original review:

I seriously believe this is one of the best games (and series) of all time. However, it would be nice if it wasn't also vying for ""most crash-y game of all time"".

I swear nobody complained about this game being unstable a few years back - the developers seems to have severely damaged the games stability in the meanwhile, as you'll see many recent reviews here mentioning the unplayability. 

That's what's so frustrating. It's not unplayable because the systems within the game are so badly flawed, it's simply that it's so unstable that you might not actually be able to play at all. I can't remember having ever played a game that crashes as much as this one does.

I always imagine they must have like two people handling this entire game's development. I can just see them saying: 

""yeah we know dude, we're doing everything we can to improve it. Unfortunately management hasn't allocated time for bug fixes. Looks like we're gonna be creating things that nobody asked for like vampires and witches for years to come."" That content would be appropriate on the assumption they'd taken care of stability and balance issues, which they definitely haven't.

Why this game is awesome:
- While the single player is entertaining and great for learning, once you do multiplayer with folks you know IRL you won't be able to go back to single player. The internal politics of the game feel surprisingly 'real', as you decide whether to work collaboratively, work against, or deceive the other people your playing with. Nothing can make my heart pound quite like trying to bullshit somebody that you pose no threat, when your in fact breaking the bank on stealth bombers and tanks to come raze their cities in short order. It's the actual word-by-word discussion over voice chat that makes the political component of this game so riveting. This game has literally had me sweating in my seat and certain moments in time. Knowing that they're most likely up to something nefarious too adds to the excitement. 

It's this dynamic I've described above that really captures why this game hits you so much harder than most others out there. So many ways to collaborate. So many ways to deceive. It's funny to think that this digital board game could really get your heart racing, but it does! Not so much for singleplayer, but against other humans absolutely. When you win, MAN IT FEELS GOOD. And when you lose, it hurts more than in other video games.

Things they need to improve:

I don't want a damn piece of content from 2k other than bug fixes. The stuff they're coming out with is like Toyota giving you a hot wheels to help out with your broken car. Sure it's cute but I need my car to work alright before I'm interested in mundane crap like that. 

Not to mention, 2k has a pretty solid anti-consumer reputation. The promoted the hell out of Civ 5's last expansion, and then damn near followed up the next week with, ""Actually Civ 6 is gonna be here soon!"". Super scammy behavior. They knew nobody would buy the expansion if they announced Civ 6 first. I'm sure they won't be behaving like that in the future right?

Of course they will!! you thought this game was for you?? It's for the 2k shareholders! While the game has gone both downhill and uphill since launch, take-two interactive stock is up 251.5% since launch! This would explain a thing or two.

The internal balance of the game is a bit off too. Fortunately they give you tools to select the exact city states & natural wonders in your game, which is where a lot of the balance issues lie. Not to mention, the math often doesn't add up. The Nan Madol city state is supposed to provide +2 culture for each district you have on a lake or coast tile, yet I've seen it provide more than twice as much as that per district. It really breaks the game because it's so unusually powerful.

They should be addressing balance and stability! Not coming up with new game modes and artsy crap. So far they've skated by with their general crappiness, probably due to the decades worth of momentum behind the civilization franchise, which they're benefitting so much from. As much as I love this game, it's hard to be a fan knowing that they've most likely already committed to releasing Civ 7 as an uncomplete game, for which they will then launch a $39.99 expansion, which will include absolutely essential game mechanics, rather than plain old 'content', so that you end up paying $100 grand total for the game.

Ultimately, I'm neutral on this game. I can't wholeheartedly reccomend it due to their shady business practices and the instability of the game, yet it's also my favorite game :/",1630377874,1702271868,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As with previous Civilization games, the objective is to grow a fledgling civilization into a dominant world power across multiple eras of human history. This newest entry enhances the addictive gameplay loop the series is known for with smart improvements under the hood and visually stunning new animations, landscapes, and stylized leaders that bring your empire to life.

Longtime fans will appreciate the mechanical refinements and additional gameplay possibilities introduced in Civilization VI. City building in particular has been overhauled, with housing limits and new district system that present more interesting strategic choices when planning your urban sprawl. Governments now provide powerful policy bonuses that can significantly shift playstyles. All of this added complexity layers onto the franchise's signature addictive loop of exploring the map, expanding your empire, exploiting resources, and exterminating rivals.

Visually, Civilization has never looked better. The new tile-based map creates an eye-popping landscape of lush forests, arid deserts, and rolling hills that transition beautifully across seasons and eras. The colorful new leader animation styles infuse the iconic figures of history with warmth and personality. The user interface has also been cleaned up and made more readable. The polished new visuals combined with an upbeat original soundtrack make this Civ game extremely immersive and enjoyable to play for hours on end.

With improved visuals, refinements under the hood, and additional replay value from a strong selection of new civilizations and leaders, Sid Meier's Civilization VI is a must-have for veteran fans and an excellent entry point for newcomers to one of gaming's most storied franchises. While not revolutionary, it is a methodical, well-crafted evolution for the series that will provide hundreds of hours of empire-building enjoyment.

- SheepHerder Bob was the first scout and explorer to circumnavigate the world in 150 BC, funded by the leader Teddy Roosevelt
- The first ever trade route was established between the Aztec Empire and China
- Shortly after Vivaldi wrote the Four Seasons in Ulaanbaatar, the Mongols entered a golden era

Tile strategy is crucial before you even have an understanding of the implications in the game? This is to me more like a civ game for those obsessed with the algebra of perfect city planning and the luck of not being landlocked and surrounded by the default raging barbarians. After a decent amount of play time it feels the game is balanced to constantly hinder and hold you back. Firaxis I play video games to excape that feeling from my career, I am sorely disappointed in this rendition of the civ franchise.

That being said slowly over time balance changes have made it more tolerable. You still must play only the hand you didn't know you were dealt until mid-game, so e.g. if you had early resources that made science a winning strategy but it turns out the game decided to bless you in theology you better redirect your momentum lest you have a medocre mid-late game. Then there are the times you ""win"" by diplomacy, what a sham. This one needs rethinking IMHO. I turn it off for better gameplay. 

Overall I think its just trying to be too many mechanics at once out of balance with each other. An amazing game were it not for all of those balance issues.",1515797014,1701992909,True,0,0,0.476377934217453003,0,True,False,False

That said, CIV 6 is needlessly complicated and the mechanics depressingly poorly explained. Each game feels like a chore instead of fun. I do not know what to do in most of the situations and the game does not tell me - having to read a civpedia or whatever instead of having a pop up with a few lines explaining it, without breaking the flow of the game is just poor game developing in my opinion and feels like artificially padding the game time.

The first few times I played this game I got overwhelmed by barbarian forces with more military stregth than any of the civs present in the game sessions. It was only after searching the Internet that I found out that, if you don't kill barbarian scouts, the game makes it its priority to overwhelm your cities with invading forces. This was not something the game explained to me or, at the very least, was a critical part of gameplay that was so poorly presented I managed to miss it. I had to LOOK IT UP ON THE INTERNET. Other Civs declare war on me from across the map without any obvious reason, etc. Yes I am sure there are perfectly good mechanics/reasons for that to happen. The point is that nothing is explained to me. I do not pretend that the previous games in the series were masterpieces at launch but at least I never felt like I was floundering for not having the game taught to me.

I also do not like the UI. The buttons are too small and not (to me) immediately obvious and many of the options are hidden from view. It's just more work in what should be fun.

Ultimately I guess I must accept that this newer entry just isn't for me. I do not find this game fun, I do not play games to have to study a PhD in order to play them, and as such cannot recommend it.",1701956597,1701956597,False,23,2,0.590996146202087402,0,True,False,False

Strongpoints: 
1. It really isn't boring, you are always going to think ""just one more turn""
2. There is a decent attempt to present different cultures
3. It has strategy elements 

Weakpoints:
1. The age/tech progression is absurdly fast. You go from ancient to pre-modern weaponry way too fast
2. The balance between playing wide/tall is clearly in favor of wide, which makes the ""strategy of civ building"" to be how many settlers can you produce?
3. While there is an effort to portray different cultures. 1 unit/building in a specific age is not enough. 
4. There is no diplomacy game. (EU4/Imperator has a fleshed out diplomacy game)
5. Units can't be produced alongside building. This means you can only focus on city building or unit building. 
6. The game actively disincentivise conquest/expansion and eco focus games with the progressive increment costs. 

In essence the game is extremelly fun in the early stages up to the mid-game but after that point it is a lot less interesting. 

Overall this is a great game for a casual strategy gamer. The game itselft is wide but has little to no depth. That's all.

Overall would recommend it as it is a good game. They really need to add the dlcs to the base game since entry for new players costs a rediculous amount of money right now....",1701864918,1701864918,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The only minor critique I have pertains to the combat aspect, but when considering the overall package, this game deserves a solid 10 out of 10.

What truly sets Civilization VI apart is its city-building mechanics, which have been refined to perfection. The political intricacies add depth, making every decision feel impactful. It's an ideal title for those seeking a relaxing night, a chance to immerse themselves in the art of nation-building.

The game grants you the power to shape a civilization from its infancy, fostering expansion and growth. While the late game may seem to progress a bit too swiftly, reaching the later ages can bring a sense of abruptness. Nevertheless, the game's overall excellence overshadows this minor pacing concern.

Civilization VI provides an ideal environment for unwinding, allowing players to kick back and enjoy the process of leading a nation to greatness. The gameplay, from societies to characters and factions, covers all aspects one would desire in a civilization-building game.

Moreover, the game strikes a perfect balance between simplicity and complexity. While some may find certain aspects a tad straightforward, this streamlined approach enhances engagement. A more complex game might risk becoming tedious, but Civilization VI keeps you hooked with its elegant simplicity.

In my years of playing, I've discovered that Civilization VI is the go-to title for a captivating and immersive experience. Whether you're starting a new civilization or navigating through late-game eras, the game consistently delivers satisfaction.

To those contemplating purchasing Civilization VI, don't hesitate. It's an absolute gem that offers a well-rounded gaming experience. Feel free to reach out; I'm always eager to welcome new players into my world. As we await the next iteration, I can confidently say that Civilization VI is a must-try for strategy enthusiasts, and I'm genuinely excited about what the future holds for this fantastic series.",1701839258,1701839258,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I play this game a lot so pacing of game needs improved specially in cities that are not the capital it takes forever to build basic units let alone building anything important to keep up with current pacing. still a worthwhile game to sink your time into and game play changes all the time so save now save often. and just one more turn turns into 9 hours.

Building an empire feels very satisfying and there is a lot of depth that isn't immediately apparent, such that I am still learning new things about how game mechanics work despite being hundreds of hours deep in the game.  In some ways this might be seen as a bad thing in that it signifies there isn't a lot of transparency in the game on how things work, but that's not the case for the most part.  For the most part it's just that there are so many things to do that until you look each one up in the in-game civilopedia you only understand the basic concepts and not the behind-the-scenes mechanics.


There are some things I would love to see improved in the next iteration, like combat.  Especially the way simultaneous-turn multiplayer combat is handled.  Right now in multiplayer it's kind of a click-fest to see who attacks with their units faster.  I can empathize with the devs because it's hard to come up with a perfect way to fix this.  When a combat starts, do you just kind of pause the game for everyone and wait for all units on either side to take turns making attacks?  That wouldn't be fun for players not in combat.  But if you allow players to just attack each other at full speed in real-time, it creates an element of a real-time-strategy game that feels out of place given that this game is turn-based.  My idea for this would be to just adjust the way that combat works to give less of an attacker's advantage except in the most extreme circumstances.  For example, if a slinger attacks a warrior, the warrior shouldn't just sit there and lose half its health.  They should engage each other simultaneously so it doesn't matter if the player with the warrior clicked first or the player with the slinger clicked first.  The only times this wouldn't be the case is when attacking from more than 1 range, such as an archer 2 hexes away, in which case having a melee attacker run all the way across 2 hexes wouldn't make sense and some advantage should go to the player that is using range.  That being said, if an archer is attacking something that can attack back like another archer, they should simultaneously attack each other whenever either player attacks so that it's more fair and isn't just ""who clicked first"" or ""who is host and has less delay.""

For other Firaxis games like Midnight Suns or XCOM2 this isn't a problem because you can either bypass the terrible launcher (Midnight Suns) or there are community-made alternatives (XCOM2), but the game binary for Civ6 has been lobotomized so that it now checks for LauncherPatcher.exe, which in turn searches for and runs the 2K Launcher, only allowing the game to launch if the Civ6 executable is launched via the 2K Launcher itself. This means that previous methods of bypassing the 2K Launcher, such as directly launching the game executable, using a launch option in Steam properties, or using the old LaunchPad launcher no longer work.
This also means that if, for example, 2K stops supporting the game, you will no longer be able to play the game as their launcher will not validate your ownership of the game; it also means that you cannot play Civ 6 offline at all. This is actually a particular kind of civil crime known as 'defrauding', which is waived by the EULA basically saying that ""you agree that you don't actually own the software you purchased and we can revoke your ability to use the software at any time"", but EULAs are rarely tested in court because individuals don't have the power to test large corporations and class action suits for games are fairly uncommon.

Semi-Serious review:
I've played this game at least once a week for 2.5 years. If you like learning while you play and love anachronistic historical crossovers this is for you.

However, it must be said that the base game while not too bad, suffers from a bunch of strange design choices (static borders, no timers for friendships/alliances, annoyingly shallow strategic resource system, NO DIPLOMATIC VICTORY, etc), most if which were remedied in the expansions. its still worth your time, I had a blast the 1st year before Rise and Fall despite the annoyances. It also has had a few UI/gameplay changes added since then so the experience is likely smoother than mine 2 years ago.

All in all. If possible grab the full version will all expansions (75% off on the 2019 summer sale, YOU CAN'T LOSE) if you like to defy history and laugh while doing it.

2023 Edit: It's still a blast! I think at this point it's safe to say it has more than paid for itself in my case. One major problem now is that the DLLs have still not been released to my knowledge, which is not very good for the health of the modding scene for the game.

Maybe not a total masterpiece, but I would still call it good.  The worst part is probably the AI being way too passive and having rather bizarre priorities.  And while I like that this game has been willing to experiment I'll admit that not every experiment panned out.  Still, there are reasons that Civilization is still the flagship franchise for historical 4x games.  The basic design is easy enough to grasp but hides a lot of potential complexity to keep people going for that one more turn after the last one more turn.  The game is also very good at providing a lot of visual information to the player at a glance which makes understanding the situation and forming a strategy a lot less tedious.  A lot of Civilization's competitors are really bad about that point.  In fact, poor documentation and unclear details such as terrain or resource presence seems to be a recurring problem in the strategy genre.  Civilization does not have that problem.  It is very good at giving you information and not hiding things.  The only really complaint I have in that department is that sometimes the presence and absence of hills is a little blurry.  But that's it really.

In terms of presentation, my thoughts are mixed.  The art style is perhaps a little too cartoony for my tastes.  It really does sometimes veer into the ""mobile game"" aesthetic.  That said, it's not as bad in that regard as some people make it out to be.  But one thing I can support fully:  the music.  Civilization has really been doing phenomenally in the music department these last few installments and I hope they keep that momentum going in VII.  The music isn't just very good, it is very varied.  Each Civilization has four versions of their central theme which is derived from actual historical music from that Civilization: Ancient, Medieval, Industrial, and Atomic.  Each version tries to mimic the broad style of those time periods.  Very basic tunes with limited instrumentation for the Ancient track, a still basic but with far more instrumental accompaniment that you might find in a generic medieval tavern in a larger city for the Medieval track, a symphonic arrangement that wouldn't have been out of place in the 1930's or 1940's for the Industrial track, and a Contemporary arrangement often featuring electronic instruments and digital sound effects while still maintaining a largely symphonic feel for the Atomic track; the sort of thing you might see in a lot of modern symphony performances and movie soundtracks.  And then each Civilization has additional Ambient tracks on top of that.  And all the Civilizations that appear in any given game have their themes and ambient music shuffled into your background music ""play list"" meaning that the sound never gets dull whether it's your first or five hundredth game.  Pretty much the only thing missing is a music select option for those who want it but honestly I could gush about the music all day.  The sound design is also on point though not quite  as good as the actual music though that is such a high bar to clear I can't blame it.  The point is playing this game can be quite enjoyable even beyond the gameplay and that is nothing to scoff at. 

TL;DR  It's a really good game despite a few occasional flaws.  It does a lot of things really well that a lot of people take for granted until they play another game and don't have those good points anymore.",1701143332,1701143522,True,1,0,0.509999990463256836,0,True,False,False

With the new DLCs VI enables challenges and incidents like earthquake and other horrible disasters.

2023 Update Review Changed from bad to good, found an ai mod that does domination well

I love all the new features and art style of Civ 6 but very sadly still won't play it because of the poor A.I. I only enjoy domination games and there has never been a version of Civ that provided an A.I. that was capable of doing that game mode well without an A.I. mod. I wish the A.I. of Civ 6 was capable of providing a challenging domination mode as I'd never put it down then. On the greatest difficulty the A.I. provides very little challenge and is not capable of building and maintaining large armies - I've tried many games with different opponents too. I've played Civilization since Civ 1's release and will still continue to play an A.I. modded 'Civ 2 Test of Time' that vastly improves the A.I. in domination mode. I also love the option of building a spaceship and colonizing another planet on a second map that iteration of the game has and wish it was included in current editions of the game. I have yet to find a working A.I. mod that makes Civ 6 good in domination mode either.",1628813999,1700965761,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a long-time Civ fan, I can confidently say that this installment raises the bar even higher.

The first thing that strikes you is the breathtaking visual design. The art style is vibrant and engaging, making each turn feel like a step through a living, breathing world. The attention to detail in city animations, unit movements, and wonders is nothing short of awe-inspiring.

The gameplay is as addictive as ever, with the new district system adding an extra layer of depth to city planning. The strategic decisions you make carry real weight, impacting everything from culture and science to diplomacy and war. The introduction of unstacked cities gives a new dimension to urban planning, forcing you to consider the geographical layout of your empire carefully.

Diplomacy has also been revamped, and the addition of agendas for each leader adds a new level of unpredictability to interactions. Forming alliances and negotiating deals are more crucial than ever, and the diplomatic victory route is a welcome addition for those who prefer a peaceful path to world domination.

The variety of civilizations and leaders provide endless replayability. Each leader feels unique, not only in terms of abilities but also in the way they approach the game world. The inclusion of natural disasters adds a layer of unpredictability, making each playthrough feel like a fresh challenge.

Multiplayer is smoother than ever, with a robust online infrastructure that keeps games running seamlessly. The turn-based nature of the game makes it easy to manage, even with friends who might not be able to commit to long gaming sessions.

While the learning curve might be steep for newcomers, the in-game tutorial and Civilopedia do an excellent job of guiding you through the basics. Veterans, on the other hand, will appreciate the added complexity and strategic depth.

In conclusion, Civilization VI is a triumph in both design and execution. It captures the essence of what makes the series great while introducing enough new elements to keep things exciting. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the series, this game is a must-play for anyone who enjoys the thrill of building and leading a civilization through the ages.",1700934181,1700934181,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only wish it was more user-friendly in terms of being a bit more transparent about strategic weights assigned to different items, events, actions vis-a-vis other computerized leaders.

But for the love of me, I just can't get into 6 as I did the others, I've got every expansion for it and add-on but the game just falls so short and flat, the graphics are fine, the music is fabulous and it just really isn't that different from the other CIV's but 6 just doesn't flow and play as well, it becomes abit cumbersome and boring, you quickly lose interest in it whilst previous versions you can just sit there for hours end and anticipate the AIs next move.

Further to add the game is just to buggy, takes to long to load and it is far from perfect, there is plenty of random times it will just crash for no reason, or it will sit there forever ending a turn and the more mods/add-ons expansions etc you get for it, the more it slows down and I do have a killer PC and you can notice it (but mind you my settings are maxed out), oh and God help you with how slow this is when you play the largest map with the most AI players.

- ""From the first stirrings of life beneath water... to the great beasts of the Stone Age... to man taking his first upright steps, you have come far.""  If you read that and just thought, ""wait, didn't bipedalism predate the Stone Age?  And why 'Stone Age' when the term is defined by man's tool making when other prior ages also had megafauna without screwing up the sequence?,"" you have considered the writing more than the designers did generally.
- Folks, should the in-game Civilopedia tell you what technology is needed to unlock particular buildings and infrastructure, and if not, what would be the harm in doing so?  I don't work at EA so this is impossible for me to answer.
- Speaking of oversights, just about every unit that you select to go off to a far location will do so inefficiently, ignoring an excess of water movement in favor of crawling up on land and wasting points to get to the same location.  You'd think they'd fix this at some point with all the packs and expansions, but nay.  It's also possible, if not likely, that you'll have issues with the ""City Focus"" tools to there the on-board all-production focus ends up generating less than the default setting.
- Micromanagement creep is worse than ever with district bonuses and wonder placements.  The sad thing is that even though Districts have their inherent bonuses, they don't [i]feel[/i] as good to place as actual buildings and so it just drags out the process with extra steps.  As for Wonders, some of the demands are rather ridiculous, like ""you can't build this unless you have a Commercial District with a Bank next to a cattle pasture.""  There are perhaps dozens like this which I never see or build because I don't have the meta to do so.  Districts and Wonders, once begun are also locked into position, so it's not like you can undo it later.  A final dumb aspect of District and Wonder placement is that if you place them on a Forest or Rainforest tile, you don't get the production bonus from the trees, they just vanish, so if you wanted that, you would have had to have sent a Builder in to clear the tile first. 
- Even without the bonuses from their beliefs, enemies will aggressively spread religion at you and you can't actually get them to stop even when asking.
- Every World Congress, you vote more or less blind to what the other Civs intend to do and they will mostly gang up on you to screw over your resources and amenities.
- Being able to pair a unit with a Great Person is neat, but as the unit rotation goes around, they'll always go first, rather than the combat unit receiving their bonuses and which can actually attack.  Why?
- Extra large culture output cities will start raiding nearby cities for their edge tiles even though they can't work them using citizens and in many cases provide no bonuses.  Again, WHY?
- For reasons not particularly well articulated, you can't move Great Works around easily and are mostly locked into their positions unless you happen to have equivalent slots to swap with.  This sounds and is unnecessarily complicated, especially when certain buildings have wildcard slots that can accept a variety of works, but refuse to recognize their own ability to swap out elsewhere.  Once more: WHY?
- No automatic terrain benefits to using scouts.  You have to promote them to get any.
- Crossing a river is the most difficult task you can ask a unit to do.  It will take years off their life.
- ""Ages"" don't always make sense and you may be coasting along only to find that your opponent did something big and you now have <10 turns to pull yourself out of a potential Dark Age.  Some of them can also rocket on by you because you're progressing too fast except if you didn't get the requisite bonuses, you're also going straight off a cliff into a Dark Age.
- ""Climate"" seems like something the devs just threw together as an afterthought.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense and mostly brings in the random events few appreciated in Civ IV, except now their immediate consequences are always negative and may only have some positives later.  Buy some volcano insurance, yeah?  GS will start you next to one 5-10% of the time.
- Find espionage obnoxious?  Well, you can't disable it anymore.
- The Big One (for me at least): The quotes that accompany building wonders or discovering civic / techs suck.  Many are now either Nerd Shit or ""how clever am I, a modern human, for dragging the peoples of the past?"" or random underwhelming quotes from the internet or quotes from people I just don't want to hear from (Reagan, Thatcher, Ailes, Rand... all leaning hard to the right).   I don't need a grandiose quote for everything (the Thoreau quote for the Great Lighthouse sucks, BTW, but no one in America is willing to admit that they only think Thoreau is good because he talks about nature and uses words they've never seen), but having the narrative voice diss you for completing objectives that have been in several iterations of the game is off-putting.

The good?

+ Features like forests don't get removed with lumbermills.  That's fun.
+ Lenses are good, if buggy a lot of the time in getting a read on Religion. 
+ Late-game additions help alleviate past gameplay lulls in the modern eras.
+ Each Civ has a musical theme that evolves with their technological progress.
+ Builders with finite uses are preferable to mobs of Workers dragging out turns and memory.
+ Governors have some interesting bonuses and can supercharge some aspect of a city's theming.
+ More unique city-state bonuses like specific tile improvements.  They're not all just a category anymore.
+ GUI is somewhat better now, although mods improve it significantly (Hills are VERY difficult to detect without a mod).
+ Corps, armada, et al were a good way of correcting Civ V's issues without the horrifying stacks of ten units you got in Civ IV.
+ Decoupling Wonders from the city center was probably a good idea ultimately and you can appreciate them better as individual tiles.
+ More resources, more wonders, more civs.  I'm not one of those weirdo western supremacy dorks who shits a brick every time he sees a brown or lady leader or God Forbid both.  I think it's neat.

I just started playing other 4x-type games (simple ones, like Sorcerer King and Thea 1) back then, and was totally new to Civ.  I thought I may not like it, as I was much, MUCH more attracted to fantasy world 4x titles, but I actually really did like it.  I didn't LOVE It, but I can see how millions of others do love the ???? out of it.  

As for the artstyle compared to past Civ games, I'm all for it.  I like the way Civ 5 looks and I also like the way 6 looks.  Probably moreso, as I already stated I'm more into fantasy (and therefore, stylized graphics).

Anyway, this game has been PHENOMENALLY cheap for the last several years.  I'm actually shocked at the discounts they give for a flagship game like this.  Blows my mind.  That said, and taking into account just how GOOD this game is at what it does (no one does it better, yet), this is a solid 100% recommendation from me.  

And, no, you don't need the expansions.  If you don't own the game yet you most likely aren't a Civ fanatic, so playing the vanilla game may even be better for you.  I still am.  But if you want them the DLC can be found fairly cheaply as well.

TIP FROM ME:    Those of you with a decent (980 from nvidia or maybe AMD Fury from 2014/15) gpu and a big-screen tv -- try finding a steam controller online (new or used - should still be cheap, even though they are discontinued and disappearing).  Playing 4X games from my couch/bed at 4K on a 55"" TV with my Steam Controller has completely changed the way I game.  ANY game with keyboard/mouse controls that isn't hyper fast (like counterstrike or LoL) plays exceptionally well with a steam controller + big screen TV.

This Civilization 6 deserves to be appreciated for its effort not just simply a copy paste gameplay from its predecessor.

I changed my mind and became a fan in Civ 5, tbh this is still my best pick in the series, because the reduction in complexity and acceleration of game pace made the entry more accessible.
Civ 6 did a few good improvements, namely the upgraded religion system made a difference (I think in civ 5 religion was not that important). but the district system is not my cup of tea.
The other thing I don't like is the piece meal DLC that hide leaders that I like by another paywall, but this is the standard industry practices nowadays, I cannot complain too much. 
Overall, this is a solid entry, if you are a newcomer, skip the plethora of cosmetic DLCs, only go for the two major expansions, if you a rich, just grab the complete edition, try it, then try civ 5.",1700667893,1700667893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Civilization VI is the game that turns every intention of going to bed at 10 p.m. into an epic saga that ends with the sunrise. Every time you say ""Just one more turn,"" you end up building the Pyramids, getting embroiled in a cultural revolution, or conquering one more city.

It's like trying to quit chocolate, but you know that eventually, you'll succumb to temptation and build a ""Chocolate Factory."" It's just a matter of time.

In Civilization VI, you get to be the leader of the world, but you also get to make colossal strategic blunders, like losing your entire army because you tried to cross a river in the dead of winter. It's like asking George Washington to trudge through the snow with his wooden teeth – it won't work, but at least you'll have a hilarious story. :)

The game's graphics are stunning, and the leader animations are so expressive that you feel like you're truly negotiating with Teddy Roosevelt or having a WhatsApp argument with Cleopatra. Maybe she can't build pyramids, but she can certainly construct drama!

In conclusion, Civilization VI is a game that will make you feel like a real-world leader – a leader who can choose to build their empire or bring it to a spectacular downfall. So, if you want to experience what it's like to lead a civilization until the early hours and wonder where the time went, Civilization VI is the game for you. But beware, because ""One More Turn"" eventually turns into ""One More Century,"" and you can't escape!",1694678433,1700640589,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 - An engaging 4X game with enough depth to satisfy seasoned strategists, but enough simplicity to not be *too* overwhelming for new players.
- A larger focus on city planning than Civilization V - an additional level of strategy the game greatly benefits from.
- A massive level of customisation, keeping the game fresh after you've played hundreds of games already.
- Continued support from devs 7 years after initial release
[b] Cons [/b]
- This game is unstable as hell at times. Sometimes (i.e. all the time) the game will lock up without crashing; depending on your setup this could be a quick close and reopen, but if you're on a low-end machine (like me) more often than not it means a full system restart.
- 2K launcher icky (just go back to the old launcher please I beg)
- Non-sale price tag for the game + DLC is ridiculous

Homemade Landjäger Sausage

Ingredients:
- 500 g beef
- 500 g pork
- 20 g curing salt (nitrite curing salt)
- 5 g coarse ground pepper
- 5 g sweet paprika
- 3 g garlic powder
- 2 g ginger powder
- 2 g dried marjoram
- 1 g ground coriander
- 1 g grated nutmeg
- 1 g ground cardamom
- Pork casings for stuffing
- Kitchen twine

Instructions:
1. Cut the beef and pork into small pieces and pass them through a meat grinder with a coarse plate.
2. Place the ground meat in a large bowl and add all the spices (curing salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, ginger powder, marjoram, coriander, nutmeg, and cardamom). Mix well until the spices are evenly distributed.
3. Cover the meat mixture and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours to allow the flavors to develop.
4. Thoroughly clean the pork casings and soak them in cold water to soften.
5. Remove the meat mixture from the refrigerator and knead it again to ensure proper blending.
6. Stuff the meat mixture into the prepared pork casings, ensuring there are no air pockets and that the casings are evenly filled.
7. Cut the filled casings into approximately 10 cm long pieces and tie the ends with kitchen twine.
8. Hang the Landjäger sausages in a cool place to dry for about 2-3 weeks. The ideal temperature is around 15-18 degrees Celsius.
9. After the drying period, the Landjäger sausages are ready to be consumed. They can be enjoyed raw or lightly pan-fried.

Note: When making sausage, it is important to maintain proper hygiene. Ensure all utensils are thoroughly cleaned, and use fresh meat. It is also recommended to familiarize yourself with basic sausage-making principles and consider employing specific sausage-making techniques.

Let me first say I have spent a good chunk of time on this game, and it's certainly addicting. I've bought all the DLC (my wallet!) and truly loved the game for almost 2,000 hours now.

Strategy is a main part of the game, but I'm dumb, so I always play on normal difficulty (Prince) and I usually just abuse really good civilizations to win.

It has nice graphics. Nothing to write home about, but it's a nice background to the gameplay.

Mods keep the game afloat. After 7 years the game has gotten a bit stale, and mods help keep it fresh.

Also, apparently they removed the menu screen in the newest update?
Uh... okay then.

But seriously, as younger me said, ""It's an awesome turn-based game, and I loved it! 10/10.""",1580079919,1700073108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A strategy game on a grand scale.

It combines expansion, economy, discovery and combat.
A classic in its latest version.

Gameplay : 4/5
Graphics : 4/5
Music : 5/5
Sound Effects : 5/5
Voice Over Narrations : 5/5
Storyline: 3/5

Overal Note : 4/5

Positive :

A beautifully developed engine that I still associate with Beyond Earth. Beautifully crafted UI.

Absolutely beautiful music.

Development of the engine in a direction unknown from previous editions.

Multiple gameplay configuration options.

Unique AI personalities.

Negative :

Unfortunately, after three days of play, the game crashed and froze. This is not a big problem, because if we have autosave turned on, we do not lose much. But one.

The further civilizations develop, the longer it takes to wait for opponents to move..

Barbarians appear periodically and quite often in heavily settled areas of the tundra. (it is possible to play without barbarians, but it also takes away the flavor of the game)

There are no epic quotes from throughout the history and Morgan Freeman quotes like Civ 4 was.
The new narrator has a nice voice, but it's not the same.

A very aggressive publisher's policy towards add-ons. For example, 2 other civilizations cost $10 and some require $50-60 in a package.

Moving away from ancient quotes in favor of modern ones and political correctness. 

Overal Review :

A very nice installment of the series. It has many advantages and a few shortcomings compared to previous editions.

The game level has become more relaxing and easier, you don't feel so much pressure from the opponents even on the Prince and King levels.

The multitude of possibilities for victory is an additional advantage.

The downside is the publisher's aggressive policy towards add-ons.",1700071001,1700071391,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

They've also started doing timed events where you can pit yourself against players around the world in a scripted scenario for the highest score, so even several years after launch, it's still getting new content.

So why in the name of God am I leaving a negative review?

Because they've started putting ads on the homescreen. 

Now, the ad on the homescreen at the moment is for Julius Caesar, the free DLC leader added a little while ago. On the whole, Caesar is fun. But shoving ads in our faces like this sets a BAD precedent in a game that was ad-free before (not counting the tiny bar at the bottom of the home screen, which was honestly barely noticeable).

Guys. Guys, come [i]on[/i]. You're doing SO WELL here. This game is incredible. It can STAY incredible. And adding Julius Caesar as free DLC was a very generous move.

You'll find yourself saying, ""Just one more turn,"" until you realize it's 3 AM and you've got work in a few hours. But who needs sleep when you're on a quest for world domination, right? The game's got a learning curve, sure, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be hooked. And if you're new to the series, well, welcome to the club. We've got cookies. And empires to build.

i played on emperor difficulty and this is what i found.  the ai spawns setlers very aggressively and builds in the tiny areas between your cities that you thought would be pointless area to build another city.  even if that makes their empire non continuous.  at this point they are just trolling you.  

then some games the barbarians are so overwhelming that you are handicapped from the start for about 20 to 30 turns before you can do anything else besides building warriors.  and by then from what i found out is that you will be so far behind in everything that you may as well start a new game.  i had 5 horsemen surround my town and destroy the 3 city improvements i made.  and i was stuck in that state for a very long time.  i ended the play through after i defeated them and then just got to the industrial era and found that while i had mamluks (knights) the french where attacking me with infantry.  one shot kills.  i assume its because of the 30 turns i spent doing nothing but trying to get rid of 5 horsemen barbarians around my capital.  i couldn't even expand.  

all in all the ai is silly and makes the game super dumb.  after 6 years they still cant get a hold of the ai.  its really bad. 

the game forces you to rush barbarians and go for an all out domination victory.  if you try and do anything else there is no point.  the ai will beat you to it because of the huge bonuses they give them.  instead of focusing on giving the ai some semblance of strategy and intelligence.  they make it dumb but with a near unlimited pool of wealth to pull from at the start making them OP.    case and point is that when you are evenly matched against the AI in terms of starting resources and units (the ai gets none), the game becomes a cake walk and not worth playing.  like beating up on children.",1490798439,1699714734,False,4,0,0.510638296604156494,0,True,False,False

Never played PC original Civs, and turned out that the game has surprisingly low amount of content as for AAA game... I would think that given games age and established formula it would be easy to have at least few historical scenarios campagn in base game, but no, just sandbox. Still worth buying on a -85% sale, but I can't see how people were buying for a full price and be satisfied on release.

Also hate everything about countless DLCs and their bundling. It's deliberately unintuitive, you need to google one of ""buyers guides"" videos and this is cancer. And fuck that laucher that isn't just not closing but also not minimizing while you playing the game.

Conc: expected so much more from something with as big name history, age and release number as ""Sid Mier Civ"" and are unexpectedly disappointed in lack of content, prices of game and DLCs without sale yet also abundance of DLCs. At least few of those scenarios should be in base game.

Upd: also bots are garbage. AI doesn't do anything and AFKais when he can capture all cities with his single OP next-next or even next-next-next tech unit, and doesn't launching space parts at all despite having Spaceports in all cities.

Additional content thru DLCs are typically not worth the price of admission and introduction of new mechanics and features tend to be halfarsed at best. 

Ai is not competent at all and will have issues fielding combat units mid to late game due to not being developed to plan ahead and to preserve units created earlier in a play thru. They had the means to as features such as preferred city locations is present and noted ingame. However, the Ai has difficulty working around the basic mechanics created in this new iteration of Civilization. 

Ex: Combat should be similar to other turn based tile set strategy games. But, the Ai was programmed to just move about with little to no guidance. Units that need time to setup will move about every turn invalidating what they can do. Others that should be offensive will idle or leave strategic locations stranding civilians, infrastructure and aforementioned ranged units to be wiped out. 

Ai will over create unused infrastructure and consume resource deposits for small early game boosts that will leave it unable to compete late game with the player. And is entirely reliant on artificial boosts to attempt to compete. Tho there are enough win conditions to keep the Ai in a playthru, as the player a win is simply just focusing on any one of those conditions. 

The Ai was never given the means to compete and I'm pretty sure it's due to Firaxis stringing spaghetti code along from game to game instead of fixing the mess. MP boils down to who picked the right Civ and got the better starting location.

Say goodbye to your job. Just make sure you have enough pizza and Mountain Dew because this game will not let you go until you win or literally die.

The one major con with this game is, despite there being a ""civopedia"", almost nothing is explained, and things that are explained are explained atrociously. You are basically required to look everything up online because the game does such a poor job explaining things.

A minor con that I found very annoying is, after you build a wonder, because they usually take a while to build and you forget what they did, you can't click or hover it on the game map to see what effects it gives. It would be great if you could do that to see what benefits you're getting, but you have to either go back through your tech or civic tree to see where you unlocked it and hover there or look it up in your civopedia. It's not horrible since the info is still accessible, it's just bad UX.

""I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible - Jew, Gentile, Black man, White. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world, there's room for everyone, and a good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent, and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all. Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world; millions of despairing men, women, and children; victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

For those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress, the hate of men will pass, and dictators die. The power they took from the people will return to the people, and so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives; tell you what to do, what to think, or what to feel; who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder! Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate. Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural.

Soldiers, don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th chapter St. Luke it is written the kingdom of God is within man. Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power - the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful; to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power! Let us all unite! Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work; that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people!

Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate, and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of a reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. 

Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!"" -Charlie Chaplin",1629841799,1699401040,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

There's just something almost magical about the way the game encompasses all of human history, bringing together culture, economics, politics, science, espionage, and yes, war, in one glorious whole, and does so in a sometimes lighthearted fashion.  With the cartoonish caricatures of the civ leaders, to say nothing of the sometimes hilarious technology and civics quotes (beautifully read by the great actor Sean Bean), it seems clear that the Firaxis devs don't take themselves too, too seriously, and that's a good thing.  

One thing new the game brings to the table I like very much is the government policy cards which allows a lot of subtlety and nuance in the way you govern your civilization.  The city districts and adjacency bonuses is also an interesting addition, and sometimes necessitates careful growth planing of your cities.  The World Congress is mostly good, simulating as it does the Council of Nicea, League of Nations, UN, etc, though I did find a mod that improves on this experience.   

Visually the game is very attractive to the eye, with beautiful natural and man-made wonders, great environmental effects like hurricanes and volcanic eruptions, and an overall very pleasing art style.  While I'm on the subject of visuals, a special mention needs to be made of the rocket launches.  They are as beautiful as they are epic, the gfx artists absolutely knocked the ball out of the park here!

Not to criticize Humankind (a game which I mostly enjoy) too much, but one thing I think Civ6 does much better is almost everything related to the modern age.  I mean, in Humankind I found the modern age rather boring at a time when the game should be at its most exciting. Further, the space race in Humankind was laughably easy and a huge disappointment, visually as well as gameplay wise.  In Civ6, however, you can feel the tension of the heightened pace in the modern age with lots of things going on, and the space race is a moderately complex and stressful affair that rewards you greatly when you get it right.  

A word about the music.  Awesome!  Best music I've ever heard in a strategy game.  Much of it will be recognizable to many people, like Lovely Joan for England, Waltzing Matilda for Australia, Hard Times Come Again No More for the United States, Recuerdos de la Alhambra for Spain, many others.  Further, I love how the musicians take a theme like the English folk song Scarborough Fair and make the arrangements increasingly progressive as you advance through the ages, to the point where by the post-modern era it's full on techno! 

Concerning the AI, I know a lot of players complain about it being dumb, but I don't know.  In my experience I sometimes see the AI doing some ill-advised things, but other times I've been surprised by some very clever moves.  Bottom line for me is the game's AI has never been bad enough to ruin the experience or take me out of the moment.  Maybe my biggest complaint is the same as it's always been in the Civ series.  That is, it will sometimes take me 10-15 restarts before I get a starting position that I'm happy with.  As every Civ player knows, your starting position is super important.  Also, I hate the Giant Death Robot.  To my mind it seriously hurts endgame, as in a stroke it makes your entire very expensive late game military obsolete.  Thank heavens I found a mod that turns them off.  

Anyway, I love this game.  I know this because of the very warm and satisfied feeling I had from completing my latest one, compelling me to write this glowing review.  It is as fun as it is educational, and as far as I'm concerned Firaxis can take their time with Civilization 7, as I'm far from finished with 6.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this.  :)

It's just not fun. After a few games of this I just went back to playing V.""[/i] [h3]- I wrote that 6 years, probably dozens of patches ago, and I've even played Civ IV. Now (2023) I've decided to give Civ 6 another shot. Let's see if my criticisms still hold up or did it redeem itself? [/h3]
[h3]Old review text in Italics.[/h3]

[h2]2023 Update[/h2]

[i]I'll try to list everything I find positive about the game over V: [/i] [list]
[*][i]""Instead of passively impressing every city state just for existing, you now have a new system that encourages you to influence your favorites.""[/i] [h3]- This still holds up. It allows for more varied strategies and ""soft power"" you can't directly production your way out of. [/h3]
[*][i]Religion now matters, as a Victory. [/i][h3] - Although it was a neat buff in V, Enemy Religion wasn't a giant threat. It sure is now. There's even a religious combat system. [/h3]
[*][i]Vastly different Civilization abilities [b]almost[/b] make each game feel unique.[/i] [h3] -  Mostly remove the ""almost"" there. Many Civs now come packaged with zany abilities.[/h3]
[*][i]Much easier moddability.[/i] [h3] - By this I mean mod use. Civ V required you to manually load each mod every time you wanted to play it, and it broke my Vox Populi game between when I wrote this review originally and now. I still do not forgive it. [/h3]
[*][i]Sean ""I am Fond of Pigs"" Bean's narration is fantastic, it is one of the few things that never gets old about this game.[/i] [h3] - Still great, no arguments there. [/h3]
[/list]
[i]Now the, unfortunately, longer list of Cons. Especially downgrades from V: [/i] [list]
[*][i]Everything feels restrictive, especially the Eureka/Inspiration System.
  The Eureka/Inspiration was designed to give players a boost depending on what they do, but it has the exact opposite effect instead.
  Every time you play, you'll want the boosts. You'll build exactly three Crossbow Men, you'll always found at least one coastal city, and you'll always go around trying to maximize your boosts.[/i] [h3] - This is still mostly valid, but Rise and Fall [b]did[/b] reduce the Boosts to 40% instead of 50% which I feel is a lot more fair. I've gotten used to it, it even gives a trade-off of whether you think an unboosted technology is worth it. It does, however, allow you to dunk on the AI. [/h3]
  [i]Contrast this with Civ 5, where I'd usually find myself in a sticky situation when I focused too much on buildings, and there could be Civs without access to water. Every game was actually unique, and strategies might have to adapt.[/i] [h3] - Focusing too much on buildings in Civ V? Impossible.
In all seriousness, this is really a trade of production for a certain amount of Science/Culture when it comes to Boosts. I would've liked semi-randomized Boosts so that you're not overly rewarded for simply remembering them all, but oh well. [/h3]
[*][i]Diplomacy is an absolute joke. Several AI Civs will hate you for performing well, and the others will hate you after you annex an entire country ""In Self Defense"" when another AI attacks you for no reason.[/i] [h3] - [b]Absolutely not applicable with Gathering Storm with the addition of the Grievances system. Rise and Fall also removed the ""Close to Winning"" negative opinion modifier. Vanilla will still suffer though.[/b] In my experience, the AI is a lot less ""stupidly aggressive"" than before on the middling difficulties. [/h3]
[*][i]There is only one way to win, more cities. In V you could dominate the game with only a few cities, in 6 you have to blob (and the AI is terrible at it).[/i] [h3]- [b]Gee past-me, and how was ""Anything but tall"" in V like? Was it terrible? I remember it being terrible due to the Science cost penalties.[/b] It's almost like competing for land and resources that breed conflicts should actually drive the game forward instead of hitting ""End Turn"" 400 times in my handful of hypercities.[/h3]
[*][i]The AI is an absolute joke. The only threat they pose is that they'll break every single promise the turn after they make it.[/i] [h3]- My first game back was with the Cree where I made a giant ""hugbox"" against Arabia, it was hilarious. The new grievances system in Gathering Storm fixes the other part where now you can beat the stuffing out of a lying AI and everyone will clap for you.[/h3]
[*][i]Decentralizing cities is supposed to make it look like urban sprawl and give a tactical choice to city development, but I'm a real ""Make Every City Amazing"" kinda guy and it really bothers me. It doesn't feel like your city is progressing.[/i] [h3]- I've mostly 180'd on this as districts allow for tactical choices and adjacency bonuses, though I would've enjoyed cities' models being a bit ""sprawl-ier.""[/h3]
[*][i]Speaking of progress, that's another thing Civ 6 lacks. Eras don't really feel like they're progressing, just going through the motions. Your territory doesn't feel like a vast expanse, but a disjointed mass of cities. It feels like you're just playing a game, not building a Civilization.[/i] [h3]- The new ""Ages"" system does partially fix this in my eyes but it does tie into a deeper issue of the game's ""arcade-y"" original design.[/h3]
[/list]
[i]A real shame, I was very excited about Civ 6. I kept looking online every day to see which Civ would be included, wondering who would show up next. Over the past year I've played a few games, but kept feeling something was missing. 
Civilization 6 is just not fun, and that's tragic. Hopefully a future patch can change this sad game into something great.[/i] [h3]- ""Hopefully a future patch can change this sad game into something great."" Well, did it happen? [b]Yes[/b]. Civ VI fixed most of their problems, and mods fix quite a bit more of them. 
What turned me off originally was that the game felt very ""arcade-y"" from its artstyle to its gameplay. Civ V's art-deco style made it feel dignified, that I am truly building a civilization. I think Civ VI can capture that, at least a little bit, now. 
Civ VI is still a bit silly, but it's finally worthy of a thumbs up.[/h3]",1504502781,1699316197,True,0,0,0.88800656795501709,7,True,False,False

- The game has a quite active modding community for unique experience.
- The game(with gathering storm dlc) gives you flexibility in winning the game.
- Animation looks better and city planning is strongly emphasized in the game.
Cons:
- Take-two launcher is really annoying for its data collection and ads.
- Online has a lot of synch issue.

*Update* I love civilization games and I keep getting the urge to play this...but then I stumbled on all the reviews about red shell and how this game literally installs 3rd party spyware on your computer. Great way to kill off Civilization 2k Games I hope you milked it enough.

Update 2. They have removed Red Shell which was their tracking spyware. Awesome. I saw the game on sale some of my friends were getting it so I reinstalled to play with them. I was dissapointed. How on earth is a supposed ""AAA"" game from a well funded studio unable to fix its AI 1 year after launch? It's frankly embarrassing and sadly probably the last civilization game I'm getting. Paradox Interactive might pump out a lot of DLC for its games but at least the games are well supported, patched, and updated with new content. I'll take Paradox' pseudo subscription regular dlc over this broken mess.

Update 3. Congratulations Civilization 6. It took you $100 worth of DLC and 2.5 years in development to finally be better than Civilization 5! It's even more embarrassing when you realize that a lot of that new ""content"" was just re-adding things that Civ 5 had. The game is better than Civ5 now. It's actually fun to play and a great game.

That said I refuse to change this to a positive recommendation. Get it on sale. Civilization games should not take 3 years worth of dlc and patching to become better than the last Civilization game.",1497878027,1699241842,False,8,1,0.580111563205718994,0,True,False,False

Now, I know what you're thinking – what's a guy who's been through the Eclipse doing reviewing Civilization VI? Well, we all need a break from demon-slaying and Brand-marked vendettas, right?

In this game, you're not out there swinging a massive sword and battling apostles, but you get to build cities, research tech, and form alliances. It's like running a Band of the Hawk, but without the betrayal – we hope. Speaking of betrayal, remember Griffith? Well, he couldn't even lead a civ to save his life, so you'll do just fine.

Now, the AI here can be as predictable as Griffith's ambition, making deals and breaking 'em faster than he did our friendship. But, hey, that's part of the fun, right?

The graphics won't make you ascend to godhood like Griffith did (if you consider that a good thing), but they're decent. The soundtrack won't make you question the nature of reality like the God Hand, but it's catchy enough.

In the end, Civilization VI may not have you wielding the Dragon Slayer, but it's a nice way to spend some time away from Griffith's treacherous schemes. So go ahead and conquer the world, just like I did with my inner demons. Give it a try, and remember – even Griffith can't ruin this game for you!",1699143138,1699143138,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Tips for new players: Always become friends with the Darwinists. You can warmonger without penalty to them. 

Science is important, as it allows you to get new technologies faster. 

If you plan to be religious, consider being a theocracy. This allows you to buy troops with faith. 

Science victory is the easiest victory. If you see someone launch the moon landing it may be a good idea to nuke them (to prevent further progress)

Nukes are a strong diplomatic tool, don't use them too often though as they can cause your people to revolt if you don't have enough amenities. This is because they cause heavy war weariness.

To use Nukes as a diplomatic tool, wage war on someone. Then nuke them a couple times, and demand a couple cities as well as whatever you wanted. They'll often accept, if they don't accept nuke them further.",1698965898,1698965898,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Apocalypse game mode is horrible, over-tuned to an absurd degree. Within a 20 turn period 6 of my cities were lost to comets, and two ally city states, after which I had no win conditions. This was not symmetrical to the AI.  Even in a ramped up end of days scenario, it's too much. To come from behind after one or two cities are hit, sure. but this much is pure frustration, zero fun. 

The comets are bad, but could be tuned. The solar flares are worse, and irredeemably bad. Certainly one of the dumbest, most boring mechanics I've ever seen in a game. Every time a solar flare comes, I have to repair every most of my key districts in my entire civilization (campus and industry). By the time that is done, 5 turns later another flare. What play patterns are the devs going for, here? Lots and lots of clicking and waiting to achieve nothing? It's just time sucking busy work to click repair over and over and over. You can't even queue a repair of a building until the district is repaired, multiplying the number of clicks. 

Literally the least fun I've had playing a game in many, many years. Tedious, pointless, futile. It is the myth of Sisyphus as a game mode. Horrible.",1698946673,1698946852,False,1,1,0.512770473957061768,0,True,False,False

Edit: Civ 4 level barbarians, check. Irrational leaders that all end up hating you, check. No leader animations, check. Espionage is pointless and needless, check. Will you lose a battle where it tells you that you're going to win a major victory, check.

All that shit and more as they mash 4 & 5 together while everyone calls it the best new cake they've ever taste.

Second Edit: 30 dollars of DLC that equates to a few new skins. They're taking Paradox's strategy to the extreme. At least they give you gameplay changes.

Third Edit: I'm a sucker. I broke down and bought the big DLC. Let me put it this way. There is nothing that this game does better than it's predecessors. Can't wait until they throw out the space version of this for an additional 100 dollars. That's it Civ. I've been with you from the start. We done.

I could go on and on about how great this game is, how much I like how great the district system is, but that would be boring pretty quickly, so I will just resume to a simple comment and a note:
Overall great game, I recommend new players to try it and learn it (I know strategy games can be rough at start, just persevere a little bit!) (Also if you can, take the loyalty dlc, it's great!)

- Extremely poor energy management system. It could be made much better, for example, with the cell upgrades going to the districts and setting the limited power output for a plant. However, we still have a ""power range"" one which restricts the planning variations and is simply uncomfortable. 
- Environmental impact is way too strong. I mean ok, there can be a few plants around the area, however, how on Earth would they make the whole coastal line drown? That's simply nonsense and it turns the game into a nightmare closer to the 300th turn, especially if you're focusing on mass-production strategy.
- The imbalance is just striking. This point is valid for the multiplayer mostly, but is a problem at higher levels of difficulty as well. 
- Barbarian issue. I understand that those are barbarians, the rejects, however, giving 1XP only for confronting those is way too illogical. The warriors are fighting just the same way as with the other civilizations, where's justice? :D But jokes aside, this has to be revamped, since barbarians are becoming the source of frustration and can be a worse problem than an aggressive neighbour, still the output from defeating them is just minimal. 

Still, those are all the flaws I could remember so far. And now, let's check the overall situation: are there any 4X strategies that are as entertaining as Civ VI? Probably yes. However, is there anything better than this one in terms of quality and perfect mechanics? Hell no. And boy, are there dozens of mechanics to witness. 

This game is on top, the crown's still there (with Civ V sharing it 13 years after the release). So as soon as you're ready to jump in, do so. You will definitely not regret it.",1698527594,1698527594,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Эта игра - настоящее произведение искусства, в котором вы сами создаете историю цивилизации, начиная с маленькой поселенческой единицы и развивая ее до мировой державы. Исследование технологий, дипломатические маневры, строительство городов, сражения за ресурсы - ""Civilization IV"" предоставляет вам бескрайние возможности для развития и принятия стратегических решений.

Но, помимо геймплея, игра обладает потрясающей музыкой, которая не только поднимает настроение, но и добавляет глубину игровому миру. Иконическая мелодия ""Baba Yetu"" на самом деле стала первой композицией из видеоигры, которая выиграла ""Грэмми"".

И, конечно, не могу не отметить увлекательные сражения и стратегические дилеммы, которые возникают на каждом шагу. В ""Civilization IV"" каждый ход - это новое приключение, новый вызов, и возможность применить свой интеллект и стратегический склад ума.

В итоге, ""Civilization IV"" - это не просто игра, это искусство стратегии и исследования, которое притягивает и увлекает с первых минут и оставляет вас глубоко погруженными в свой собственный мир цивилизации. Я наиграл в нее более 600 часов, и могу с уверенностью сказать, что это время было потрачено с пользой и удовольствием.",1519153358,1698408239,True,3,0,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,False

Civ 6 has the same primary issue as Civ 5, where they can't figure out how to actually make the AI smarter and just give the computer absurd bonuses to make it more likely you lose. They're erratic, irrational, and lack any sense of strategy. They don't analyze your victory conditions, then work against them. They just do things. Often, things that don't have any chance at achieving victory. They'll waste resources on a victory condition they have NO hope of achieving, rather than focusing on the one that might actually work. It's dreadful. 

What's worse, they actually made the game MORE frustrating to play than Civ 5. The district system and forced micromangement of both builders and military engineers to establish tile improvements slows gameplay to a crawl. Armies and Corps were a nice idea to make armies slightly less tedious in the mid/late-game, but you can almost entirely ignore the military aspect of the game beyond taking out barbarians. And, there are no barbarians by the time you can form Corps. 

After 100 hours, victories on every difficulty mode, and with a handful of different leaders/conditions, I can confidently say I don't like this game. It's not too difficult. I don't hate the genre. I liked Civ 5. Unfortunately, Civ 6 was a step backwards.

I played civ5 a bit a long time ago but this game is my first introduction to the series, and it's just very mediocre. The price is absurd as well (I get that you spent a lot of money on detailed 3d models that you can't even zoom into, but come on, it wasn't needed). Luckily it goes on big sales. 

[b]Civilizations are same-y.[/b] You get a unit that can boost your military during an age, bonuses that make you stronger during certain ages and bonuses that generally help you achieve a certain victory. That's all. And for whatever reason it's supposed to be a selling point of the Civilization 6 game.

[b]The victory conditions don't interact with each other.[/b] You always have to max-out one thing (science, faith, culture, money/production) and use it to achieve goals. The four victories are very disjointed from one another. Playing science you care only about science and production, playing culture you care only about culture and maybe some faith, playing military is just like playing science cause you need better weapons and production to build them, playing faith is somewhat fun cause you need to build infrastructure for delivering missionaries to different places quick, but the AI just has no chance.

[b]The AI is braindead. Diplomacy is stupid.[/b] I played the game on King difficulty which I heard is the ""balanced"" one. But the problem doesn't lie in the difficulty, just in how the AI behaves. It seems to target a certain victory, but is incredibly slow. I won 3 games and haven't seen the AI get over 50% to victory. The AI also allows you to walk all over it thanks to diplomacy. Usually the world is split in two blocks that fight one another but if you aren't the civ with the least amount of arms no one will target you. The AI will also do absolutely nothing to stop you from ever reaching victory. **This isn't a historical game, but the AI behaves ""realistically"".** Playing against players they'd attack you to stop you from winning even if they don't have a chance. Here, the AI just sits around and maaaybee manages to capture like 5 cities in the first 200 turns from some other AI.

[b]For a strategy game, there's very little strategy.[/b] Sure, you follow some builds, like ""here I will take +2 culture in each culture district and then build culture district and also get a religion that gives me +1 culture per district"". But it feels like some simple puzzle. People call this game chess, I call it ""match-three-gems-in-a-row"" mobile type of game. The strategy could happen in war or faith combat *if only the AI was actually playing the game* actively. The most strategy is probs in choosing the right government bonuses for the time and researching the right tech, but this is like 5% of the final gameplay.

[b]Game can't choose if it's a historical simulator or a strategy.[/b] As I said, the AI behaves as if it was real life (except for ""this is a game"" sort of silliness). Their leaders also have some agendas you need to fulfill to have good relations with them which are usually super random. Tech tree and culture trees are realistic. But civs and leaders make no sense. Your king/queen is immortal, Ancient Greek free cities can beat victorian England and exist in the same period. Peter the Great leads an army of cavemen. Modern cities can be protected by bows.
I say the game should just abandon all realism and turn into a puzzle strategy. 

With all that said, game isn't the worst. You kinda loll about around the AI, get big numbers and win. It looks good, the UI is good, music is cool, graphical designs of civ leaders are cool, narrator guy is cool. The features are also there. The culture and science tech trees are very nicely balanced and introduce cool new features along with time. Too bad that these features don't interact in any meaningful way and the AI barely plays the game.",1697881090,1697881177,False,5,1,0.561649620532989502,0,True,False,False

It's incredibly good but because at least for me this  game is honestly lacking compared to earlier titles. While this game improves on most aspects from earlier titles, such as city improvements, animations, resources, unit controls etc what infuriates me is that it's a massive step back in the diplomacy and war department. The ai does not want to fight wars. Ever. Like they simply do not happen. To my knowledge, I have had exactly one game where the ai declared war on me. In every other game, it was I who was the war monger while the other nations sat around passively. I don't need an army other then to deal with barbarians. In general you can fully ignore diplomacy, and millitary and just focus on peaceful deving. There is no satisfaction in dealing with other nations because there is no threat, no nothing. At the 5th level of difficulty at this game it's still a snooze fest and I could honestly leave all my cities undefended and be fine. Compare this to Civ 3. At the 5th level of difficulty you are playing the game of thrones. There are AIs which are naturally agressive and will declare war on you if you don't give them gifts, if they think you to weak or occassionally simply because. When they attack they will come not with 1 unit, not with 2 but 20, 30, 40.  You have to be on your toes, you have to do diplomacy because if you don't the AI will team up against you and crush you. It's thrilling. You are constantly walking this tight rope of balancing millitary production, city improvement. The ai will have resources, tech, money, luxuries which you need and all the time you are asking yourself what can I afford to give, what can I afford to trade which will long term keep me in the lead. Wars can be fought often and it won't ruin your relations long term. This is why I am giving this game a negative review. I play this game for the game of thrones style politics while guiding a nation into the future long term and I am annoyed that both civ 3 and 4 games which are over a decade old have these features but this one doesnt.",1697812078,1697812078,False,7,0,0.541584014892578125,0,True,False,False

Playing single player provides further guidance, but this is not indicated anywhere in the game prior to launching the single player mode, and the game has a built-in Civilopedia which you can refer to to fill in the rest of your knowledge, but it's difficult to navigate and very incomplete. Utterly inadequate on all fronts.

Multiplayer is without a doubt the worst of any Civ game. Visual glitches abound where one or more players see thing (including important thing like cities) in the wrong places. The non-host players will crash or freeze, and the higher the ping the worse it gets. Helpfully, the game overrides Alt+F4 (close application) so you have to open task manager to close if it's frozen. The non-host players will also get periodically desynced, meaning they get a loading screen and the host player gets a notification. If a player crashes the game will immediately give their turn to the AI, who plays inexcusably poorly. 

Compounding this, even the single player game is loaded with bugs. Even something as simple as automatically advancing between units for orders routinely fails, either moving the camera to a unit other than the one being controlled, moving to a unit who is already moving like you gave them orders, or ignoring that some units need orders. This is an absolutely core game mechanic and it's completely broken. Everything built on top of it is also completely broken, but even if this was the only problem the game is still a failure as a Civilization game, and the fact that the game is frustratingly unclear on how things are *supposed* to work or what any given mechanic *actually means* results in situations where it's impossible to tell if something is working as intended and simply hard to figure out, or if it's a broken mechanic that doesn't work correctly most of the time (spoiler alert it's absolutely the second one in every single case).

On top of what is mechanically wrong with the game, the leader character models are hideous and you are forced to interact with them for any diplomacy options. They look like Bratz dolls. Even the DLC character who look somewhat more humanoid just look like newer Bratz dolls. To make that entire system worse and more frustrating, the characters have few lines and as such never actually specify why they're upset. Rip them all out and the game will be better. They're absolutely horrifying. Why is diplomacy a full-screen thing, also? Why does it not prevent me from interacting with the word *through* the screen? Wouldn't it be better in every way for it to be a popup? You guys got this right as far back as Civ: Call To Power, which was nearly 3 decades ago, why mess it up now?

Overall just a shitty, shitty hit for those of us (myself included) who are hopelessly addicted to Civ. If this is your first time, there would be no worse entry point for the series in the past 30 years.",1697362232,1697806464,False,0,2,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Civilization 6 still stands as the ultimate digital board game for history nuts where the board --the world-- is the soul of every challenge and opportunity. 

In Civ, you build an empire that vies to stand the test of time while competing with other civilizations for a set of victory conditions, be it peaceful or warmongering. But you're also playing with, for, and against the generated map where forests, deserts and resource-rich tundras influence how your civilization flows. 

This challenging dynamic does come with a learning curve to overcome, but much of what you need to be to be victorious isn't necessary when you start exploring. You will settle cities and develop the tiles in your empire, you will train a formidable military force and wage turn-based warfare while also conducting diplomacy. Six game winning objectives exist that rewards both military focused players and players who prefer peace. Plenty of in-game hints help ease new players while also offering course-correction for when things don't go your way .

The need for foresight is unending. There is no obviously 'correct' way to improve your empire. There are always sacrifices to make, like when I fell behind in science due to lacking eligible tiles but clutched the game through the diplomatic objective. It's a fantastic, richly realized way of forcing difficult decisions at every bend in the river where no two cities are the same. The Civ staples of war and diplomacy have been honed to the sharpest edge in the franchise. AI leaders are now given agendas (one which is public and the other being uncovered through espionage, relationship building or context observation) that overtly tell you what they like and don't like and make it possible to stay on everyone's good side if you're willing to. 

This is definitely a thinking mans game which is fantastic in multiplayer with like minded players. Matches can sometimes take a week to finish if you're playing with your friends 3 hours a day, but usually the endgame can be reached in 20 total hours. Which isn't bad at all due to the addictive nature of this 4x game.",1697766753,1697771859,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Either you know Civilization or you are probably new to strategy games and 4X in particular (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate).  Civ has been called the ""ultimate digital board game"", and with good reason.  Civ VI is the most technically and graphically advanced entry in the franchise (so far, with Civ VII on the horizon), and is a sprawling, deep game but surprisingly accessible, which is often not the case with grand strategy games.  It will take you a long time to run out of things in the base game, much longer with the DLCs, and then there's a strong modding community, which will let you try anything from simple UI tweaks to the completely ridiculous.  I feel like I still haven't run out of things to do (let alone the literally hundreds of achievements to unlock).

The only people I would not recommend play this is anyone with poor impulse control, as the franchise that invented the phrase ""Just one more turn..."" can indeed be a huge time sink.  Otherwise, if you enjoy strategy games, Civ VI is the modern standard by which other turn-based games are measured (not that it's necessarily the best, as that's deeply subjective, but if you're a fan of the genre, it's a must-play).  It manages to include a lot of historical richness while still adding its own character and flavour.

The DLCs added a lot to the game, including diving into fantasy, which is unusual for Civilization.  You can fight zombies or include vampires and mythical heroes, or try and survive an apocalypse.  ""Gathering Storm"" in particular is an excellent addition, if in most game modes its model of the climate crisis doesn't end up really affecting much.

If you watch for specials, you can now pick up the whole package for cheap, which will mean it's more than worth it for time you'll get out of it, though even at full price, if you're a strategy gamer you'll potentially be able to enjoy hundreds of hours.",1697689731,1697689731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As mentioned by others Builders get limited uses before expiring - more control on what to decide but affects game flow.  Starting a war with someone has penalty points depending on the situation which makes sudden attacks from others less likely. Lots of data everywhere which which will mean a lot f game play to figure it all out. Manual like civ v is very rudimentary but nicely written.  

Some bugs still exist such as the tech tree locking up, characters telling me I am loosing money when I am making it, thanking me for keeping my border distance promise that I never made etc. Other annoyances are the characters (from other cities) repeating the same offer that I have declined 9x already..... and since they dont make a counter offer when I decline theirs, then they make me click another screen to close it out, 
which is unnecessary - just close it out if there is no counter offer. 

BUT the REAL problem follows: A major  STEAM ultra-screw-up. They forget we actually want to play the game we purchased and not have our system lock up with crap ads in the background and to decline some greed-wits in Europe monitoring our game or weeding through our computer. 

(forced update) The NEW GAME START is total hell - most of the time I can not get to my game and certainly cant play any saved mp3 in the background. Neither work. BUT before the spy adware it worked fine. Try to get help for this and you can waste hours online searching and no effective response from Steam or its assignee. 

(the previous Civ V will play properly but still ad/spyware to deal with.)

Main negatives are the ABSURD background ads when all you want to do is play the game, HOW STUPID CAN WE GET with European data mining etc (which I believe can be declined) each time you play.

One promise here and I hope others will follow is: absolutely no more steam purchases until we can just play the game we pay for without the annoying nonsense.

When I try to get steam support (since I think it is their ""starter"" for the progam (based on steam c-r-a-p ads) steam sends me to aspyr (or whatever as apparently they made the game) then their site just wants to sell me more cr-ap , subscribe to a newsletter (dgas) and no other apparent options.  Wtf and that doesnt mean what the fun - cause it isn't. What ever happened to just playing a game we paid for?

Boycott time ! That being said there may be some partically effective workarounds by NOT connecting to the internet, or once blitzkreiged with noxious interference and advertisements, close those windows then play.",1680146176,1697664475,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here are some of the main new mechanics and my opinion on them:

Districts: You place these on tiles and they make up most of the buildings you can make in a city. There are two main consequences of this new system. One, it requires significantly more time and effort to play the game in an optimal way since which tiles you place your districts on is very important. While I like this in single player, it makes multiplayer more tedious. Two, it kills ""tall"" builds in a pretty extreme manner. While some people complained civ 5 took its pro-tall approach a bit far, the districts system completely kills tall builds because districts simply have more yields than tiles and they are limited by the number of cities you have. It is also advantageous to place cities close enough to make their districts close to each other for adjacency bonuses. There is also no penalty to making more cities other than settlers getting more expensive as you build more settlers. So there is really only one way to play this game and it's spamming as many cities as possible as close as possible.

Civics: Culture is now like a second type of science. Your culture yields allow you to advance in your civics tree similar to how you use science yields to advance in the science tree. I like this mechanic. It adds more depth to the strategy without being boring or tedious. Civics can be just as important as techs depending on what you are going for so this makes low-science high-culture builds possible, even in multiplayer. You'll still want to catch up in science at some point but prioritizing culture over science is a valid strategy. Overall, pretty good mechanic.

Policies: These are kind of part of the new civics system but also a separate mechanic. Civics unlock policies and government types and you can run a certain number of policies based on your government type. This mechanic can feel a bit overwhelming and tedious at first but after a few hundred hours of play, I started liking this mechanic too. It is also something that adds strategic depth to the game.

Loyalty: This is essentially a mechanic they invented to stop extreme forward settling and I really like the idea, although there are some issues with implementation. The population of your cities emanate an aura of loyalty to your civilization and if you settle a city far away from your civilization and close to an enemy civilization who has a lot of high-pop cities nearby, that city will flip to the enemy civ. While this mostly works well, it can feel really dumb on congested starts on deity difficulty where your capital can start losing loyalty already in the very first few turns. They probably should have made the capital have higher defensive pressure or something along those lines.

Other than the new mechanics, compared to civ 5, I think the new art style is significantly worse and in addition, they seem to have followed ""diversity"" quotas when choosing the leaders. There are some female leaders who weren't of any real historical relevance.

The soundtrack is great. It might even be better than the civ 5 soundtrack.

Overall, it's a decent game which has some advantages and disadvantages compared to civ 5. It's probably worth a try, especially on sale.

Unfortunately my fears were true. Please note this review is written from a point of view of long term fan of the series, but I belive most annoying parts of the game do not require experience of previous games to still be quite painful to play around.

I'll start with positives,
Tech trees and new cards system seems to avoid the major problem of Civ V, where community quickly realized there really are only 2 effective playstyles, with minor variations in late game, depending on the victory you are going for. Ability to boost tech tree and culture forces player to play around their spawn location and while it relies heavy on random factors I still see it as good change, because you need to play with the cards you've been dealt.
In short you don't like games with strick META you will like this one more.

Redesign of combat promotions and support units eliminates previous unbalaned strategies that relied on leveling ranged units to get massive advantage on sieges. Now range for example can be boosted by support units and some naval units have increased range by default, making combat more balanced.

Religion is now a real mechanic that affects a game way more than some extra builings or great people currency, including new victory method.

If you have DLCs, Climate Change in Gathering Storm is great addon to play with, putting massive pressure in islands focused maps and lat game.

There are some questionable decisions like confusing resources system, balance of civilizations, way too many policy cards to comfortably juggle in late game, but I see these more as very confusing at first and kind of neutral if you play few games and learn by doing.

Now the biggest crime of this game that does not let me give that title positive review, city districs system, which are extensions of your city that occupy a map tile like you city does, unlocking  for that city building of its category, for example, workshop is now in industrial district, shrine in religious, etc. These tiles are more, or less effective depending on the tiles adjacent to it, there are also special districts that can't be placed only on compatible tiles, like aqueduct or canal.
This makes min-maxing your districts not always possible depending on your city placements, depending on free tiles, rivers etc. 
That little RNG element is not bad in itself, it just forces player to spend a little too much time planning perfect placement for all the districts they want to build before settling in new location, confusing at first, but becomes easier when you memorize all the tiles and bonuses.
There is one thing that makes this new mechanic go from aditional chore to infuriating RNG hell. You can't build on strategic and luxurious resources. You have perfect spawn for your first city but there is one tile of chocolate ina way? You need to give up at least one district or wonder or both. Is it blocking you from build a canal? Too bad, you need to move or give up naval play. I want to say it decides who possibly wins a game at turn 1, but it is even worse. Strategic resources like iron still are visible only after researching it in tech tree. That means, even if you have the perfect spot that can fit all the buildings you want to fit in the city, you still can be screwed over by the game, when strategic resource shows up on random tile 10, 30, or 50 turns later, and there is NOTHING you can do to play around it or prevent it. 
Awful game design that makes multiplayer games massively unbalanced, and if you want to beat the game on divine, enjoy wasting your time reseting, because now spawning next to a resource is a bad thing.

INB4: I know there are mods to let you erase all resources, but it is not official. If I want to beat a game with mods I can just install wim button. Devs team decided to ruin player experience by one simple mechanic and I respect their decision to make your game unwinnable if the stars do not allign",1697572163,1697572163,False,50,5,0.598257720470428467,9,True,False,False

It's because the AI aggressiveness and diplomacy has been nerfed in the extreme from Civ4,  The AI leaders will denounce you at the drop of a hat for the sole reason they don't like you.  They will declare war on you, then not attack you, and when you are about to take one of their cities will sue for peace,  If you take the city anyway, all the other civs will accuse you of being a war monger.   
Also, the AI simply does not build military units, especially in the late game.  On King difficulty, Japan only built two warriors any called it a day,  For those who like to play cultural, scientific or religious games Civ6 will be a challenge, because you really don't need to worry about being attacked by another aggressive civ with the same intensity as Civ4.    The issue I have with the game is that in  order to win cultural or scientific games at the higher levels you will be sorely tempted to declare war and pillage the scientific and cultural districts of your opponents.  Districts which the AI fails to protect.    However, if you purchase Civ6 Athology and get the Rise ad Fall and Gathering Storm DLC,  the AI is much improved.

- It takes a lot of time to get fully into this game. Consider your first 100 hours tutorial.
- 2K Support is AWFUL!!! You will most likely need to contact them if you play long enough.
- You need to install half a dozen UI mods to make the game enjoyable.
- Requires a high powered computer to be playable in the late game (otherwise turns take FOREVER).
Pros:
- Lots of content to spend 100's of hours on.
- The leaders make the game play feel different, yet mostly balanced.
- Modding community has a lot of extra content in case you need more.

I'm gonna get straight to the point, Civilization is an amazing franchise, however, a sequel game hasn't made me this disappointed than the time I went to see Amy Schumer doing stand-up.
I have many notable issues while the playing the game that just straight up made me go ""why"" or ""tf?"" CIV VI attempts to add on in many ways to the franchise but by far fails miserably, while playing this I struggled to even get through one hour of gameplay before giving up (I had it on double time or Online turn cycle.)

CIV VI removes many notable features I've come to love, even the simplistic of ones, and tries to innovate but somehow making the game comparable to that of rocket science for a lifelong player (maybe I'm just braindead?) To be honest, I shouldn't have to feel the need to install a mod to acquire a feature that should've been in the game in the first place.

Here's my 95 theses with Firaxis Games:
Want to Automate builders, and scouts? - NOPE
Want to build Wonders all in your strongest city? - NOPE
Want to keep all of your tiles productive? (Build on all tiles?) - NOPE 
[Wonders now consume tiles, Districts that were once buildings in CIV V consume tiles, Workers only last for 3 tiles)
Want to play peacefully or build tall? - NOPE (Outpaced by AI + the system favors War + Inflation system.)

Whats the Inflation system you may ask? In the previous game, you would build more and more productive cities, with price for units, buildings, wonders, etc, never catching up. In this game, you are slammed with a crazy turn price if you want to build more things. 

Wonders are under-powered significantly in this game, almost feels as if you are being punished for building them in the first place, why waste my time with a wonder (that would've given you a significant bonus in CIV V) when I can just build so and so?

The UI is a confusing, disgusting, horrific mess. The Artwork is horrible, and I'm talking mainly about the characters, why are their eyes so big? Why does it feel like I am playing a Gameloft mobile game? None of them look realistic. 

World Congress? SAY LESS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EXIST IN THIS GAME. (If you wanted it, you can't get it unless you cough up $40.00 for the DLC.) Not to mention when you did finally get there, it just constantly spammed notifications every turn, and was generally gnarly to look at.

Diplomacy? Practically non-existent. You would think the AI would be capable of actually working with you. Everyone just ends up making each other mad, because nobody can meet each other TOTALLY realistic expectations.

Adding a Dark Age system? Why the hell does it need to exist? Theres with no way to avoid it. It feels like they are just purposefully giving me testicular torsion for playing the game. 

Let's talk briefly about Policies... The Social Policies in CIV V don't exist in this game as a simple system. For some reason, culture just isn't a thing or has minimal impact, whereas you would typically purchase bonuses depending on how you want to play. In CIV VI they divide it into seemingly 3 different bonus boards that you have to keep track of? Some of which are free (Including a seemingly useless Governor system for each city and era theme bonus system.) The main being a Civic policy tree where you need to research policy cards to display the bonuses you want. Like okay, I see where they might think this is an improvement to help enhance how players may want to play, but seem to over complicate a system that was fine to begin with.

A simple note, why do we need to use a launcher for this game? Practically useless, crashes the game on start up, or won't load at all, they just steal your info on top of that. Literally they are spitting in your face like a drunk goth chick at a Dennys.

Honestly, to prevent this from just being a continuing wall of text I'm gonna spare you guys the rest, just don't bother trying to get into this one. They had good intentions I'm sure and they also had some cool ideas like a dynamic climate and landscaping system with a actually nice looking map that reacted to such events, but took it too far just over complicating things. Lesson to be learned here overall is that sometimes its okay not to change things, not everything needs to be different in a sequel title. Hopefully CIV VII will be something better than this, till then, Ill just return to V.",1697327506,1697327506,False,0,0,0.447761178016662598,0,True,False,False

So i was playing first game on easiest difficulty to LEARN mechanics. Sure i did not understood most of it (the new ones of course) and eventually i lost and then i thought that is fine because i have no idea how it works. Then i decided to play another game, oh right i chose to play skirmish, so anyway now i reduced AI count down to two and started game however it didnt changed anything since the AI is pumping out world domination. Really? On the easiest difficulty? AI should stagnate at some point where they hit the limit to unit count but no they reached me and above. My goal was actually do tourism but hell with that when AI spits out every resource double the count. 

Then i have a question, HOW ON EARTH I CAN LEARN THE GAME? IF AI IS STILL UNSTOPPABLE?

I should have refunded this and moved on and kept playing civ5.",1697220869,1697220869,False,2,3,0.512420833110809326,0,True,False,False

This is a paywall (or DLC barricaded) version of Civ that took a little too much inspiration from Endless Legend.
While some of the changes are improvements from Civ 5's issues, I would not recommend it over Endless Legend.
The main redeeming factor for this version of Civ is that it has an actual Tutorial that's actually helpful, sigh.

But two issues;
The fact that it crashes so fucking often and can glitch my whole computer is unacceptable. I had it on xbox for a year before getting it on a new PC with good specs i paid around 2000 for total. Onxbox it crashed if I tried multiplayer w more than 1 person, or a map bigger than standard, or any special game mode, but it was an xbox, and old gen, so that's ok.

BUT on the PC before I even started my first game it crashed. i had to lower the graphics settings and make sure nothing is running in the background (while not having to do this for ANY other game) just to start a game. Now, maybe its better than xbox, but I still can't use more than 1 special game mode at a time, a map larger than standard mixed with anything special, etc.  

!THIS IS FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE MAKE YOUR NEXT GAME RUN BETTER THAN A LATE 90S CD OR I WILL SWITCH TO A CIV CLONE INSTEAD!

turn... (Still a masterpeice) [/h1] I only came to Civ V lately, as in this year. I’ve barely played a bit of the predecessors, just to get an idea of what I missed before the paragon that Civ V is graced my monitor. There are balancing issues yet with Civ VI. And the achievements need more challenge. 

16. Multiple full color map filters: It’s much more than just the lovely map art, & the view of a map before the world is uncovered. They improve decision making just like all the other menus in the game. Pins are added to mark the map for exploration.

15. Augmented GP Abilities: You can retire a GP, convert him to a collectible or unit upgrade, keep him around for passive boosts, or even pass on him altogether; saving your points for the next GP in the lineup. If you want a GP & are losing to another civ, you can throw some hard earned gold into the GP pool to steal him before they are able to recruit him.

14. Wider choice of Historical Great Persons: I loved having John the Baptist found my first religion. But, also you can view a gallery of all your collected art & relics anytime, which are also obtained as relics from religious martyrs, & found in villages.

13. Movement is more intuitive & the zone of control is more transparent. Where movement is slowed down from geographical features on the map, you quickly feel more boxed in at first. But, this feels more natural because you begin to live in your own civ, not really moving out to see the world until mid-game or later. This forces you to be more aware of your neighbors than it did when you branched out all over the map.

12. Escort Bindings & Unit Stacking: This is actually going back to Civ IV &, it definitely is a no-brainer. No reason why we shouldn’t be able to bind a soldier to our settler & send him around the world. Being able to build armies & regiments takes the warfare to a new level, in terms of power on the front line in a small hex of space.

11. Promotion & naming of units: Lends a greater personal investment in “The Great White Arrows,” when you know you are sending them to their death with 3 promotion levels down the drain. There is a randomization feature that is great for getting these crazy names, if you don’t want to name them Jack or Fred.

10. Roads Simplified: They are laid automatically by traders. Yet, options are still present for making individual road segments with the engineers. Military engineers & builders are like specialists, compared to the workers from Civ V who did it all. The trade routes system is simpler to use, but you can NOT tell where you last sent specific routes. Of course this doesn’t seem to be a problem, since it’s easier to see at a glance & by popping out the right side tab where you already have routes currently.

9. Addition of short term projects in the construction queue, similar to the Civ V world’s fair for late game boosts. You can boost your bank account by investing in the Commercial Hub, or beef up production, Military, or Science at any time you need an edge in a certain direction. This gives the player more control over the outcome, & certainly allows for serious strategy.

8. Graphics are without perceptible flaws. This makes the game even more engaging... immersive! Wonders are bigger. Also, you can see the great works & trade them. Camera orientation during combat needs correction. It is necessary to edit game files to gain certain optional controls that should have been in- game, like spinning the map & stopping the infernal unit auto-advance. It does have the appearance that they weren’t quite finished with this aspect of the game at release. The art & graphic changes add greatly to the experience. For example, you can hover over districts in other civs to spy out what great works are hidden in which buildings, if you are planning to steal some art.

7. The City/ States are color coded, providing bonuses for suzerain status, which is hard to maintain for any length of time, since there is much competition. Conquering a CS removes those resources & the protection buffer they provide from the other civs. You also have the ability to conscript their military. So, it’s more to your benefit to keep the CS intact.

6. Espionage: You have a choice about whether or not to invest in training spies. You can choose what action they take; steal art, siphon money, sabotage production by burning buildings, etc. Or, you may use them as counterspies, protecting specific buildings & their adjacencies. Roleplay is enhanced by choices for escape when detected. If you capture an enemy spy, you may trade him back to the opponent, or not.

5. Developing a culture feels more like an integrated part of your civilization, rather than an optional sidetrack. Not only are the wonders showcased on individual tiles, but they’ve made the details more visible, like mine cars zipping around the track. The art & music become a part of the world around you, with increased abilities to place & move works physically.

4. The religious combat is great! Before, you had little options for dealing with those missionaries wondering into your civ, tearing apart the fabric of your culture. You couldn’t attack them or remove them with a unit without a war dec. The inquisition is more realistic, & dying apostles leave behind relics, which can be placed in temples, or traded as valued great works or stolen. I did find it unfortunate that I can’t rename my religion to a certain denominational name if I choose the Christianity symbol. You are able to choose a generic zodiac symbol & give it a name of choice, but that really is illogical. You should ideally be given more choices in personalization, not less than in Civ V.

3. Alliances are totally expanded, allowing you to form relationships on different levels. It’s possible to convince the AI to change its plan to attack. The AI is more responsive to diplomacy, behaves more rationally & gives you feedback on how you are meeting their agenda. You are given more options for holding the AI accountable, as in being able to denounce them, or make them pay for spying on you. Sometimes the option appears to ask them to remove their units from your borders. But, this is not yet consistent.

2. Combat: Increased barb difficulty has upped the challenge. Over time, they fade from the game as you begin to encounter other civs. I don’t encounter pirates in international waters. A slider to increase the appearance of barbs would be great. Either way, the combat is definitely one of the best improvements in the game. More siege equipment is available. The improved landscape features allow for greater defensive power. Fighting is more visible & realistic looking.

1. The system of civic progress has been streamlined. Some are pulled from the Tech tree, the ideologies, & policies of Civ V. Taken together with the Tech tree, it adds a masterful touch to the gameplay & just makes more sense. With the system of card slotting & governments whichever you choose, you can reach the victory of your choice. This expansion gives more control over boosts, & allows you the chance to steamroll your game, if you are wise enough to “lead your people well.” Comments & questions are welcome.",1635612454,1696926706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would generally give it a high-ish rating... 7/10. Here are the only things that I see as problems in the game that bring down the score: 1. Gathering Storm expansion has a built in climate change model that you can't turn off. You can turn down the natural disaster intensity, but natural disasters aren't the problem. I expect that there will be natural disasters, that is fine. What I DO NOT want is the way that they escalate over time into the late game, causing sea levels to rise and all of that other NONSENSE. Natural disasters would be a great addition to the game if not for the escalation over time feature. This forces you to play with the Rise and Fall expansion, which is missing other things that I enjoy being in the game, creating an experience that is not fully customizable and ultimately leaves the game wanting for features that were in previous Civ games. 2. In single player mode, you cannot make de facto team alliances in the game options screen with other AI players. It should be self evident why this is bad. This in combination with the game's juvenile AI thinking creates a situation in which there are no true alliances in the game, causing any ally to turn on you the moment you decide to take nearly any kind of war action, which is typically necessary to win the game, even if not going for domination victory. 3. The creators of Civilization VI have now and in the past typically avoided specific political leaders for political reasons, and I feel this damages the game, in addition to simply not including SOME leaders that should be a no brainer for entry into the game. Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Pol Pot, Vladimir Lenin, Emperor Hirohito, and so forth aren't in the game for what appear to be obvious political reasons. Other leaders that you would think would be in the game but aren't are George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, and any one of a number of European monarchs that would certainly be more fun to play with and against than the ones that they have placed in the game. This is a game about history, yet they specifically choose to pick out ""leaders"" that were fairly historically insignificant to represent countries that had, quite frankly, much stronger leaders across history. Yet they are unavailable for play. And certainly, I'm not against the addition of MORE leaders rather than less, but Firaxis/Aspyr are asking for quite a bit of money for all of these expansion packs and yet none of the aforementioned leaders are included in them. Instead, what do we get? A whole bunch of stinkers that no one wants or cares about. It's a problem. Gameplay is solid, content and features are lacking in some places.

The games appearance and UI are unrefined and simplified, giving the whole game an armature and almost juvenile feel. The diplomacy in this game is completely  non existent.  Each ai has a list of things that give them severe opinion  penalties. Not only is this annoying for the player; I mean who wants to be denounced simply for having one less ship than Norway, but it also  ensures that the ai all hate eachother. Gone are the war pacts from previous civ games. Roosevelt is too busy denouncing someone for being on a different continent while Victoria is too busy denouncing them for being on her continent. In total, you'd think they'd have this formula figured out by now,  but no, they don't. They attempted to ""modernize"" the experience and threw out a large majority of beloved features in the process. They simultaneously over complicated some features such as city management whilst also simplifying numerous others. At least other Civ games improved as time went on, but their solution to these problems was to further complicate things. Do you like colonizing and conquering, here have an inane loyalty system that only makes sense 10% of the time  and that the ai can't manage at all. You like coastal cities, well make sure to kill every civ before the industrial era or your cities may just end up underwater by the 1800's. In total, this entire game is one massive case of cool concept, terrible execution. Do yourself a favor and purchase one of the previous civ games.

Never and I mean NEVER did I think my opinion of this game would only get worse with time. I can definitively say that this is one of my least favorite games from a reputable developer of all times at this point. With EVERY dlc, the ai has gotten worse and worse, to the point of being almost nonfunctional. The ai refuses to settle more than a few cities unless you play on higher difficulties, and even on higher difficulties, it's pathetically inept. If you survive the initial warrior spam on deity, then you are very unlikely to face any challenge for the rest of the playthrough with a few exceptions up until the race for victory. The new leaders are horrible and are in some cases literal reskins of existing leaders. How about you give us actual content Firaxis instead of sticking Teddy in a cowboy hat and giving yourselves a pat on the back. This game has single handily turned me against this series and I have no hope for the future. Civ V barely functions on modern hardware so it's incredibly frustrating to play now, and this game is just a steaming turd.",1643522270,1696819403,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

As you build your civilization from the ground up, you embark on an emotional rollercoaster of triumphs and tribulations.

The sheer grandeur of ""Civilization IV"" is awe-inspiring. Every turn feels like a canvas on which you paint the story of your people, your culture, and your legacy. From the very first city, you nurture it like a parent watching a child grow. The emotional connection to your virtual world is undeniable.

The diplomacy, alliances, and betrayals evoke feelings of trust and betrayal💔, while the thrill of technological discoveries resonates deeply. When you complete the journey to victory, whether through culture, science, or conquest, there's an indescribable sense of accomplishment that brings a tear to your eye.

The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, composed by Christopher Tin with the iconic ""Baba Yetu,"" the theme song, adds layers of emotion to the gameplay, turning it into a truly transcendent experience. It's a musical masterpiece that elevates ""Civilization IV"" to an emotional symphony.

But what truly sets ""Civilization IV"" apart is how it reflects the triumphs and struggles of real-world civilizations. You feel the weight of history and the responsibility of leadership. You learn about the consequences of your decisions, both good and bad, which can lead to poignant moments of reflection.

In the end, ""Civilization IV"" isn't just a game; it's a testament to the human spirit, an emotional odyssey that takes you through the rise and fall of civilizations. It reminds us that history is more than facts and dates; it's a tapestry of emotions, and ""Civilization IV"" lets you weave your own thread into that rich fabric of time.
