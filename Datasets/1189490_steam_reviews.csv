[/i] I think if I were new to the genre and this game was the first I'd tried, I would have bounced off it immediately. Here are some scattered thoughts on it: 

 - The combat mechanics are great, but they lack dimension. You and the enemy face one another and fire off combat arts that are selected and set beforehand. There's no movement and no party system (that I've encountered), so think...Pokemon, I guess? 
In order to push through the midgame you will need to seriously consider your strategy and gather martial arts that are all synergistic with one another, otherwise you'll quickly be overpowered by NPCs with well-built kits. Pay attention to all the effects they're building up on themselves [i] and [/i] on [i] you, [/i] you may be killing yourself by casting attacks or depleting your energy supply without realizing it. 
Personally, I've always preferred either action combat or FF Tactics gridlocked combat, so having a turn-based system where both characters are locked in place was both visually and mechanically unengaging. That's a matter of taste; I think this is a good system with a lot to offer for the right player. 

 - The world is somewhat small and limited in interactivity compared to similar games in the genre (Tale of Immortal or Hero's Adventure, for example). The difference isn't huge, necessarily, and if I hadn't played those other games, I might not have felt that this one was lacking. But as things stand, Hero's Adventure has a lot more life in its world, and Tale of Immortal has way more options. 
Road to Reincarnation (this game) has less life and less to do, on top of a less interactive world map than either one. It suffers mostly in the comparison, and may be a good fit for a player who wants something more streamlined. 

 - The immortality/lifespan mechanic is actually impactful. Cultivation, martial arts practice, travel...basically everything in this game takes in-game time to do, and lots of it. As you achieve new realms of cultivation, your lifespan increases significantly, but so does the required time-investment to improve further. It might initially take months to improve a demanding skill, but by midgame it will take years or even decades. 
This sounds brutal, but the game is generous with lifespan extensions, and I think it's balanced. I was annoyed by it initially, but with time I came to appreciate that this is the only game I know of in the genre that makes you [i] feel [/i] the passage of time, and therefore the importance of achieving longevity. 

I'm giving this a thumbs up because it's a good game that will be very rewarding for some people, and I'm just not the ""some people"" it's for.",1705809175,1705809491,True,4,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

There is an english translation mod on the workshop and you can even browse some of the chinese mods by using google translate and then copy pasting the stuff you're looking for. Installed some good mods that way and with the translation mod you can open a real time translator by pressing Alt+0 (zero not the letter) that will even translate modded content in real time ingame. Its not a good translation, but better than nothing.

As for the game itself, going to discord for the guides is pretty much mandatory, as there is a lot of stuff to learn. I'll say this though: The game starts very slow and unassuming. The skills you start with are crap and you'd think combat will be as bland and slow as this forever, but there are a lot of builds to try once you specialize (like sword Qi, gravity, arrays build etc) where all the slotted skills, passives and perks work in cohesion for some crazy stuff. It just takes your character literally a few ingame decades to get the basics and then a few centuries to get all the good stuff in place. My oldest character from last game was almost 1000 years old and at ""Deity Transformation"" which is the highest level you can get before you eventually do the tribulation and ascend and thereby beat the game and pretty much one shotting everyone. The game world will generate younger generations too, so the npcs you started with and are friends with, will also age, get stronger and have higher positions in their faction. You can even give them alchemy exilirs you crafted, for example longevity pills, and they will take it a while after the interaction to increase their own lifespan. 

Seriously, there is a ton of stuff do once you get past the early game slog. 

One pro tip for making money from the guides: Invest in your ""soul sense"" stat, then sell npcs where your soul probing worked (thereby indication that your sense is higher than theirs) one expensive item and then use the hostile ""threat"" action to get the item back. Rinse and repeat and as long as your soul sense is higher, you'll get the item back. The reputation loss you can recover by doing quests from the castle like buildings in cities. Once your money starts flowing in and you get into into crafting and alchemy, your first few ingame decades are all set up. Good luck.",1701627942,1701627942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This immersive title allows players to chart their own path within a world full of possibilities, providing an engaging gameplay experience that truly stands out.

The game's deck-building mechanics are a highlight, featuring a vast array of skills that can be utilized in battle. The sheer amount of available skills keeps the deck-building aspect fresh and exciting, leaving plenty of room for experimentation and strategic planning. Players are given the liberty to choose their starting position, whether it be as a genius brimming with potential or a commoner striving to master a single skill over several years. This element of choice enhances the replayability of the game, as different starting scenarios can lead to varied gameplay experiences.

However, there are a few notable downsides to the game. For English-speaking players, an unofficial mod from the Discord community is required to translate the game, as the developers have yet to provide an official English translation. This can be a bit of a nuisance, especially considering the developers' diligent weekly updates which might not always sync with the pace of the translation mod. This could potentially leave non-Chinese speaking players in a lurch, unable to fully appreciate the latest updates to the game.

Another area of concern is the game's main storyline. Although the game boasts immense replayability in terms of combat style and character development, the main plot remains relatively fixed. Players will inevitably encounter the same characters and end up performing similar tasks, which could potentially limit the game's replay value over time. However, as the game is still in development, there is hope that the storyline will continue to evolve and offer more variety in the future.

In conclusion, Mi Chang Sheng is a captivating cultivation game that offers a unique blend of freedom and strategy. Despite some drawbacks, primarily for English-speaking players, the game's immersive world, dynamic deck-building mechanics, and replayability make it a compelling choice for fans of the cultivation genre. The game is still a work in progress, and it will be exciting to see how it develops and improves over time.",1686892769,1686892769,True,4,0,0.58749997615814209,0,True,False,False

I've found this game to be a brilliant gem that really bring out the atmosphere of a cultivation world. Especially if you have read the massive multi million word novels of ""凡人修仙"" and/or ""百炼成仙"" to which this game makes a few references.

Tropes in an average cultivation novel may include the main character easily defeating enemies several tiers stronger than themselves. Or the author might describe advancing through each stage as ""only one in ten can survive this advancement"" or something similar... but obviously the main character succeeds without any problems every time.

After reading those, and I'm often left wondering - how does the rest of the world without plot armour feel about all this? If only one in hundreds of billion can ascend, where does that leave the average Joe and Jane? How are their lives, where are the stories that describe their struggles and sufferings?

觅长生 will help you get into that role if you want to explore that. Unless you deliberately give yourself super easy mode or follow walkthroughs to abuse game mechanics, certain points of this game made the challenges of cultivation feel real while playing.

The actual gameplay mechanics of this game felt like something in between a visual novel and RPG, similar to something like Princess Maker, except pretty much everything is optional except for advancing yourself to the next tier before your life span runs out. You can spend your in game time by meditating, or in other ways of improving your character or you can choose to explore the world or participate in world events. Combat mechanics is a mana / turn based system. Minor engagements against weaker opponents can often be skipped.

This game ends at ascension and my play lasted well over a hundred hours, though I was being fairly completionist and trying to complete every event I could (thankfully not the thousands of years as if you were really cultivating!).

Otherwise you will reach a point in the game where the build you agonized over and thought had reached a pretty decent state get's one shot. Or worse, in my case rendered literally incapable of ending a battle because your build doesn't deal enough to damage to break your opponents shield. So you're forced to forfeit the fight and lose because the AI doesn't have that option even though they weren't strong enough to beat you either.

Things i enjoy:-

 - Fun card game battle.
 - Different sect have distinct combat style, and there's quite a different number of them.
 - Tournament battles.
 - Decent story spanning thousands of years (Can be very long game).
 - Good music.

Things to consider:-

 - Linear main story, freedom to do a lot evil stuff even attacking random people you 
   encounter, but don't change the main story in any way (Main story wise can only be good 
   guy).
 - Too difficult, without looking at guides or play-thought, you will probably run out of lifespan 
    before attaining godhood.
 - Not enough cosmetic, you will probably encounter similar looking NPC character (wearing 
   same clothes or familiar faces).

我玩下来觉得核心很棒，但是界面和交互值得优化的点很多。比如副本用鼠标点击没办法自动寻路，而且所有副本基本上都是一个样子。大地图用鼠标路途中有时能停下有时候又停不下来，渡劫专属技能要一直在技能库里还没有办法选择隐藏，背包的过滤和商品页面不同，需要两次熟悉过程。技能释放可以用键盘多按快速选择不同的元素我是挺后面才偶然发现的，好用是好用但是技能的快速释放没法指定元素的优先度，自带的记忆系统我至今没搞清楚逻辑，这导致一旦战斗需要一点点思考但是本质很无脑，比如只要按照元素优先级无脑按顺序施法的那种的话，体验就很尴尬。不能无脑练按因为可能会选错，但是真的要不断检查是不是正确的元素又有些折磨。

然后我觉得图鉴的优化空间挺大的。有时候明明看到了丹药和草药的技能，比如任务栏里面有介绍，或者甚至装备栏里有，但是如果你没吃过某些丹药，或者没用草药练成过丹，那么有些信息是不会被记录到书里面的。以及图鉴界面虽然会显示耐药性，但是耐药性上限不会成长。虽然会显示所有的丹方，但是药材和丹药的已有数量需要再自己翻背包。背包没有搜索。还有要炸炉的情况没有提示。以及一旦替换丹炉放好的药材要再放一遍。还有就是丹方一旦一种药不够就放不进去其它药材。而且缺少的药材是什么，缺少了多少，这也要我自己按照名字一点点找。前期真的学习曲线巨高。得基本背熟了草药名才真的有趣起来。感觉完全可以做成有一些标红作为提示某味药草缺失了，或者至少用一些颜色或者图标来让玩家更容易辨识药物的种类和稀有度之类的。总而言之我觉得可以优化的点真的太多了，虽然不影响游戏内核的趣味，但是真的挺值得被优化的。

个人觉得丹药系统也挺有优化空间的。我一开始一度把整个系统想得过于复杂了，导致我一度想不通为啥有些配方明明看起来不可以但是又可以。感觉可以对药引的作用有更多叙事上的引导。主要还是它需要的属性跟数量其实是分开来的看的，在我看来有些反直觉。比如我一度不理解为什么 主寒，副寒，和主寒，副平，需要的药引数量居然是一样的。以及为什么我的两边草药已经完美做到了平衡，还是需要加入药引。在不断试错终于搞懂之后，自己配比自研丹方其实还是很有趣味性的。

装备系统我准备留着二周目体验来着的，所以就基本完全没碰，材料无脑直接出售赚钱。

如果慢慢跟着主线玩，其实体验相当不错，但是支线和副本感觉目前禁不起脱离主线的长时间游玩。

战斗虽然可以跳过，不过很折磨我的是我中期有段时间可以轻松金丹后期打元婴中期的所有海上的怪。我又特别不想浪费时间去闭关，只想着最高效率刷钱，然后增强自己的资质。这就导致我同样的怪反反复复打到吐还无法跳过。因为是遭遇战，如果不想浪费大量游戏内时间就得硬着头皮打。但是如果不想浪费现实时间就只能选择快速传送无脑赚差价而不是享受探索未知传说的乐趣。这点在我后来境界提高之后好多了，可惜因为随机事件和岛屿我也都体验过了，依旧还是比较无聊。我对探索地图解锁那些秘密很有期待来着的，但是直到后来玩主线才知道可以通过跟人交流提高探索度，这点让我略微无语。所以我中后期的游戏体验一度有些畸形，属实是有些可惜了。

总体而言如果你喜欢修仙的世界，这个RPG很有代入感，内容丰富，值得入手一试！

还有晋级是真的能感觉到难度，不准备完全是真的过不去，我觉得挺好。但是有信息差，你只有临到突破的关口才知道哪些丹药能辅助突破，这样很浪费时间 本来修炼耗费的时间就长，应该提前说明一切能对突破有帮助的信息和材料（你跟我说一个大门派连怎么晋升金丹都不广为告知，而且还没有晋升药？？你要放在化神还算合理），还得碰运气去找丹方和丹药 五品的根本就找不到 不停刷刷刷 脑子都刷大了。。。

Takes some time to know the stuff. You have skills (spells in combat), passive skill (affect your cultivation speed/provide stats or buff in combat), your usual stats like luck,lifespan, etc and understanding of dao (悟道）which affects the level of skill/passive that you can learn.

The interactions between characters are limited and only the selected few have unique responses or dialogue.  There is no real benefit in being friends with someone except learning their martial arts...and once you get above certain level of power, you just beat everyone you meet for resources. With little to no drawbacks.

The other frustrating thing is the way cultivation is present here. You basically sit at the inn for years and cultivate. The process is boring and very fast, meaning you reach the end of your lifespan quite fast without even doing anything fun. Also, despite world being supposedly ""randomly generated"", its events are pretty much pre-set as well as dates for them.

Overall, i'd give it a bit more tries, but so far it is a very unassuming game. If you are looking for a decent game of cultivation, I'd recommend choosing Tale of Immortal over this. If you haven't played it yet, ofc.

*多加一些随机任务？奇遇，交友任务啥的，到了后期就是不停闭关修炼，刷拍卖，感觉有点枯燥
*背包界面有点别扭，感觉要筛选什么要点好几下很麻烦

There's a translation patch available on the Amateur Modding Avenue discord (google for it). [strike]It's not a very good one but makes the game playable enough (with the help of google lens for the still untranslated parts).[/strike](see my review update below). I hope to see this get an english patch.

Update: Original review was at 20 hours and it's been months if not longer since then. Game gets updated often, both the stable and test branch. It's nice to see the devs actually care about the game and dont plan on abandoning it, which i've seen happen to other games of this genre sadly. 

More importantly this game is more enjoyable than ever thanks to the folks over at the Amateur Modding Avenue discord. The translation patch has gotten much better with their newly redone experimental translation mod, which I highly recommend over the last one. There's still a few missing translations, but I found myself needing google lens a lot less this time around. Not to mention the community for this game on that server is much more active now so it's way easier to get help now, this has been the biggest factor for me that's made the game way more enjoyable to me now. There are even a significant amount of guides to help new players on the discord server now, this has made my playing experience way better. I still hope to see an official english update, especially after seeing what it did for amazing cultivation simulator and tale of imortal.

English translation

https://discord.gg/3rZDVYDWtm
join this discord > mod release> go to latest file > download only that file, and follow instruction read me in the file, it's not hard to mod for Eng translation, that's what my concern before purchase, will it be too hard to do the eng mod. The translation is good enough to play entire game with good translated in-game guide/help to give you info on every game mechanic

After couple of play through, now my main char reach golden core realm, as there's no guide much on the internet I will leave some guide here :

1. If you don't know what to do just follow the quest : there're 3 quest tabs, first one is the major quest, 2nd the recurring event such as auction, fighting competition, and the 3rd one is sect errand that you register.

2. How to find money - 
2.1 you will get salary of 120/ year once you have' been promoted to be outer disciple (10 reputation with sect is needed, you get 1 rep/errand you have helped sec). Errand will refresh every 3 months (1 job is needed to be done to refresh)

2.2 This is the best way to find money I found out now - when you aim to boost your income don't meditate too long, aim for 3 months to refresh sect job, do sect job to earn sect crystal, use crystal to buy sect weapon > go to auction (occur every February), you can get good amount of money by this way.

3. When you meditate you get around 2x of passive cultivation point (in this game translation called retreat) you can choose how long to meditate to cultivate your internal energy - check the time on left on important event that you don't want to miss. 

4. Your primary  goal in early game should be cultivation to promote your realm so you can become inner disciple, so you can learn more kung fu and choose your master (1 can be selected among 3 choices). 

5. Debate is a source to enlighten to increase proficiency and level up your skill tree, debate with the master is the best as you can select topic to debate to focus on elemental or skill that you focus. After debate, you will get thought which you have to study it in your disciple room to gain proficiency. 

Hope this make you want to play and know more on how to play this game

It's Magic the Gathering where you play as a Chinese Superhero. I can't simply say this is Wuxia because it is very clear about that you are in some version of China more so than other Wuxia, it comes across more nationalistic than fantasy. 

I like this game, it just feels well... narrow. The events are spaced out too far, there are not enough of them, the world feels half empty and with all that open world you kind of are forced to play a specific role... alright let's get technical.

Graphics - Nothing amazing here it is as you see it a lot of drawn art with sub-decent particle effects. I mean the resolution could use some help as you get muddy art from time to time.

Art - The style of the game is appreciated, I am a fan, I do wish that techniques got more devastating visually but it is what it is.

Grind - I can't even call this as game play, the grind here is in Enlightenment of the crafter skills. You will naturally increase your base cultivation so don't worry about that. The grind is trying to make weapons and alchemy, there is very little hand holding here and you basically can kill yourself trying to figure things out so make sure to save before doing either.

Gameplay - It's a TCG in effect but with adventure and those wuxia tropes we want so bad. There are hidden minigames which frustrate me because they are actually good so why hide them? 

Game Design - This is probably where the game suffers the most, the structure of the game comes across as amateur; after replaying it several time I can say there is content to be had here it's just that this content is skipable by just playing the game normally. You get locked out of certain things happening or meeting key characters because you simply did other thing.

Depth - I had to create this because this game... has a lot of things happening in the background. Alchemy and Crafting for example... becoming a sect elder and it just goes on. There must be at least 100 different turtle shells all doing different things and giving different results when you use them. If you like crafting games you can have that, that ain't even what I'm mad at.

Early Access - The game ends at Nascent which probably because of the translation gives off an awkward vibe when the head of the female sect is explaining about baby making and facing her inner demons. Regardless the actual power gap between major realms doesn't exist exactly - that is you can have golden cores that are as strong as some of the midling foundation.

Conclusion - It's a solid buy, I can say I got my moneys worth out of it for sure.",1629038772,1629558811,True,7,0,0.572809278964996338,4,True,False,True

Right now it's basically sword or nothing because sword builds are the quickest to kill enemies (1-2 rounds for same cultivation, bit more for higher). I actually think some of the other builds are really interesting and strong, but it's not worth spending so much time in each battle when I play them. There needs to be a way to bridge the time gap between fast and slow builds.

Really fun game. Has lots of potential too. It really needs an auto battler though. Fighting against 20 demonic beasts each time you do the foundation quest gets really boring.",1627192082,1628037576,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,True

+题材很好，虽然说国产游戏修仙题材有点泛滥，但是这款游戏弄的个人修仙还是不凑的。
+作为卡牌游戏也比较新颖。和市面上的很多卡牌游戏比起来，觅长生还是有不少比较新颖的地方的，甚至说玩起来有点像打扑克，你需要选择如何把自己的牌打出来组合。

缺点
-人物形象太单一，人物看起来重复感极强，还有就是人玩到80多岁不修仙正常人头发也还是黑色的，不知道是不是用了霸王洗发液。
-服饰也很单一，希望作者能把人穿的衣服拿的武器显示在人物形象里，要不然人就那几个动作，看起来好单调好尴尬。
-任务少而且感觉很多任务结束很突然，从这里来，到那里去，打个人，完了。建议把任务做更多样化，更多选择性。
-""随身爷爷""除了跳出来几次解释来龙去脉以外就没什么用了。建议把随身爷爷做成一个可以在客栈休息或者门派休息的时候叫出来的人物，跟他对话，问他问题，有什么不会的随时请教他。
-人物活着太无聊，虽然说是修仙吧，但是要是或者都这么无聊的话还是早点轮回了好。人物能做的事情很有限，太吾还能斗蛐蛐种菜建家园呢，我们的主角除了练功就是做任务打架了，感觉活着真是无趣。
-奇怪的灵根系统，越专精反倒是伤害越差劲，有些神通需要不同的颜色触发，这就导致灵根越少感觉越弱。希望抽卡系统能改成按照灵根大小抽牌，灵根越大抽的某种颜色的牌越多，而不是按照权重来。

建议增加的事项：
1. 更多路人更多奇遇更多任务，路上天天都没什么人，大部分时候遇到的都是什么沂山帮和禾山帮这两拨人，如果你做了他们的任务他们好像后面都出不来了，走路愈发无聊了。里面也提到了猎怪任务，都做出来就行啊。
2. 自动寻路，现在从一个地方走到另一个地方还得一格一格点，希望能做成点一下目的地会找最近路线自动走过去。
3. 散修线，爷爷明明说了散修也可以的，但是现在看来散修比加入门派差远了，希望能把这条线和其他门派一起给补充一下。
4. 买东西加个Max选项，现在买个10个药材还得自己手动输入，希望能弄个直接调到最大的。

说了这么多，其实还是希望作者能够把游戏做成一款好的值得骄傲的国产游戏。先给打个7/10吧，觉得也大概对得起36块钱这个标签了。",1582880365,1582880365,True,2,1,0.497171878814697266,0,True,False,True
