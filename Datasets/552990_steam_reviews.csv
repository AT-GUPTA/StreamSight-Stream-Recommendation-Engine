This is the only game of its kind, honestly. You are thrust into battle against like-minded enthusiasts of naval history and combat... in absolutely, astonishingly, beautifully crafted and rendered 3D models of the world's most famous (and sometimes most odd) warships of history. These ships range from the turn of the 20th century, to the middle of the 20th century, the true test of naval might in days past. Sail aboard the ship that started it all, the HMS Dreadnought, or dominate the skies with the USS Enterprise... Use the Long Lance torpedo from a stealthy, swift Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer to sink the bulky, slow, but hard hitting battleships... Test to see what history never could, ""who would win?"" scenarios, like the Bismarck versus the Iowa, or the most legendary showdown that never happened, the Iowa versus Yamato.

The game is constantly evolving, and sometimes it seems odd, and unbalanced, but there are literally hundreds of ships, from almost a dozen nations in history, to choose from, in 11 distinct tiers, each with special traits that can be catered to almost any play style. The learning curve isn't steep to have fun, and even to win, isn't much harder.

Apart from premium ships, there are many ships to research for free - you start out with access to four tier 1 cruisers and they play very well at early levels. The daily login rewards, battle experience, campaigns, etc. build up quite quickly.   

Certain battles are quite challenging. Playing against bots in co-op battles is easiest, where you can achieve c.98% success in winning battles - by comparison, random battles against players are tougher, where you might achieve c.50% success. Brawls and ranked battles make it even more challenging to increase your skill level. 

There seems to be a general rush to get to higher level ships but don't overlook the lower tier ships. Each ship plays a bit differently, with its own strengths and weaknesses - part of the fun is learning to handle them   and use them well tactically. The WOW official YouTube channel is useful for seeing how to vary play styles for destroyers, cruisers, battleships, etc.

I am loving the customisation (albeit most are paid features), with special commanders with voice overs, permanent camouflages / ship makeovers, and seasonal themes - these all add a role play experience (one of my recent favourites was the Heroes of Might and Magic 3 theme, which brought in some nostalgia as someone who has played that series).

If you've ever looked at your wallet and thought, ""Wow, I wish I could find more creative ways to empty this faster,"" well, World of Warships on Steam has got your back! 🚢💸

The game offers an exotic range of ""opportunities"" to part with your hard-earned money, wrapped in the tantalizing guise of lootboxes. Don't get too excited, though. The chances of you finding something valuable inside are slightly better than finding a real-life mermaid. Maybe.

But wait, there's more! They have something called a ""battlepass."" What does it do? I don’t know, pass the battle onto your bank account, perhaps? 🤷‍♂️

Now, let’s dive (pun intended) into the real stars of the show: aircraft carriers and submarines. These two are the Beyoncé and Jay-Z of the game, untouchable, omnipresent, and occasionally annoying.

Submarines, or as I like to call them, the underwater ninjas, have this fun game they play. They go ""ping, ping, ping!"" and unless you play your ""I don't wanna die today"" card (damage control for the uninitiated), they bless you with homing torpedoes, seemingly straight out of a sci-fi movie. Who knew warships had a crossover with Harry Potter's magic?

As for the aircraft carriers, oh boy, where do I start? Imagine you're playing dodgeball, but the person throwing the balls at you has an endless supply, and every time you dodge one, someone from the other side of the playground snipes you with a rock. That’s what playing against CVs feels like. They can spot for their entire team, meaning that hiding is about as effective as trying to camouflage a zebra in a snowstorm.

And did I mention the no-detonation rule for subs and CVs? Yup, they're like the VIPs of the game. All the perks, none of the risks. Must be nice!

In conclusion, if you have a penchant for the masochistic enjoyment of pixelated naval warfare, and an even deeper love for thinning your wallet, World of Warships might just be the next game not to play. Sail away while you still can! 🏴‍☠️🌊

Still very little counterplay to subs. CV's are like playing with cheat mode on, except now its even harder to kill CV's. 

Monetisation is off the scale, for less rewards. You have to put in 10's of hours to get a 'chance' to unlock ships, you can spend real money and still not get what you want. Seem to be doing all they can to attract new players and do very little to keep them.

Constantly adding bizarre cross overs, like this one with Azur Lane. While Legacy bugs (from near day one) when it comes to aim etc. remain in the game.

Definitely not recommended. Wargaming please sort it out. Tweaking anniversary rewards slightly doesn't even begin to cut it.

Too much advantages for Carriers. Just doesn't fit with the rest of the game and dont get me started with subs!

EDIT.

A lot has changed with the game since I wrote my initial review.

Wargaming is hell bent on monetising everything, locking events and ships behind pay walls using the fear of missing out psychology to open players wallets.

They do NOT listen to negative feedback. At best they will make small concessions but push through with detrimental to the players changes. 12.4 was the supercontainers nerf, a 50% reduction in contents. The player pushback was huge, all they did was eliminate the worst addition (grey booster). But 50% reduction of contents has been made permanent.
Now 12.8 (8th anniversary) their discord has been hot on this topic (because of the mentioned 50% reduction of contents in supercontainers) - wargaming are deleting negative comments and feedback wholesale - live - I have seen 44 + comments disappear before my eyes while reading them. Comments that were ON topic. Citing derailing as the reason for deletion.

Apart from the censoring and refusal to admit their bad decisions are driving away paying customers, the rapid fire monetisation tactics is toxic.

The best gameplay you can find is somewhere between levels IV and VI. Tier VII and upwards is all about build ups and investment in premium ships, or a grind that is of galactic proportions, and takes centuries to complete. But gameplay is tweaked constantly and the updates keep rolling, so things tend to improve over time.

You can play entirely for free, you can put a few bucks into the jar so the devs can drink a beer, or you can squander your savings buying a nearly infinite variety of naval paraphernalia. Your choice.

This game has a disgustingly manipulative match-making. They will monitor you progress of your in-game missions, and deliberately give you trash teammates with trash ships to make you lose (i.e., 3 bad players with Kageros V.S. 3 good players with Cossacks) . Speaking of trash, it's not even them playing not good. We are looking at DDs-exploding-wthin-2-minutes and afking-as-the-CV kind of trash.

Also, this game is entirely based on RNG, which Wargaming has complete control over. Land you shots? RNG. Light some fires? RNG. Cause some flooding? RNG. Getting hit? RNG. Getting teammates? RNG. Opening daily containers? RNG. If they deem you are not likely to quit, they will make your dispersion crappier, fire chance lower, modules more likely to break, enemy's dispersion against you better, teammates dumber, and fk you over and over until you rage quit. 

How crappy is the dispersion? Looks like not having locked on. How bad the fire chance? Conqueror 30 hits 2 fires. How likely may the modules break? A fucking DD with 127mm guns touches your shimakaze the slightest, and breaks all your torpedo tubes. Have fun reloading those torpedoes!

Guess what, you can't do **** about it, 'cause they will shrug it off by saying you have bad luck.

More disappointingly, this game has achieved monopoly in this market. They would and definitely will milk every player like a chick till he's completely dry to increase profit. please try not to became one of the chicks and stay away from this greedy game.

My advice for new player: get away from this game as far as possible. They'll give you some treat in the beginning, and fk you sideways after you find a kick out of this game, spend a lot of money and thus can't decisively quit for good.

It,s hard now to impress me : )  For the last 13 years or so my ""career"" I have been with Steam buying mainly games in the sales. Amazing those sales : ) 95% off. Really? I'm in.  This January, having  a bit more time to game, I decided to increase my collection through buying on sale games only. Sometime in February the war-gaming franchise popped up. Premium tank, plane and ship plus goodies 95% off. ( next to the free play option). Hold on.... 95% off you say? I'm in. It's now in the queue waiting to be downloaded due to monthly broadband constraints.
Fast Forward to Feb 26th. I log on to steam and see I have a gift. Wow, I like gifts. Who sent it? W.o.W. ""Captain your ship awaits and here's some free stuff ""  I like free stuff. Let's move that up the list for downloading : ) 
 
Downloaded all 3 titles by early March but with a lot of good games to play, I wasn't expecting it to get much of a look in. How wrong I was. Eight weeks later and I'm playing nothing else. I have a few games i really want to play so to play 1, that's a big ask. I tried Warplanes and Tanks but they fell by the wayside. I'll have a look again at Tanks sometime but for me Warships is where it's at. What do you mean, I have to work? I have a Tier X ship to acquire. What can be more important than that?
Eight weeks on I,m days away from the Hindenburg  arriving  and the current Captain of the Roon is waiting to transfer ship. An important step for me as the arrival of Tier X is my stepping stone out of ""The Pond"". A term I use to describe Co-Op to a friend who plays here on my account. He plays the British boats for me.  He's not allowed out of the pond yet. If in Co op you see puddleclouds in a British boat, please type the following msg ""Hi friend of puddleclouds... I hear your pants!!""  As two friends gaming who ridicule each other at mistakes that would be an Ace card you'd give me. I'd have a lot of fun with that. So stepping out of the pond and into Ranked, Random and Division play. Ready I am, for Human vs Human.
Still with me? Let's assume you are : ) As you can probably tell, I love the game. Eight weeks every day I turn up for duty. I don't miss it. I find the time. Completing the Battle Pass daily challenge is a must : ) Hunting subs with my Cruisers and sinking Battleships with the Destroyers just fills me with joy after a days work. Then a problem occurs, please allow me to explain.
At Tier VII I join a Clan KDBB, a non obligatory setting clan. I msg the Commander. Player replies and says not much going on. Nobody replies to msg or takes part in activities. Sounded disillusioned to me. I thought well at least I get bonus for being here.A later msg said "" Happy to make me Commander"" I declined. I wasn't ready. I logged on one Friday to see a Naval Battle going on. I didn't know what to do and only scored a point. I proudly announced it on the clan msg but no one else took part. We suffered a huge defeat. The following Monday the clan Commander was gone. Nowhere to be seen. But what's this. Your %&£""$% joking? Who made puddleclouds Commander of KDBB. A clan with 13 scurvy sea dogs who cannot assist the clan in even Naval Battles.
I pause for a while. thought for a while, then decided to play the role. Leading KDBB is Commander puddleclouds.
I set about msg to the eight regular Captains requesting they take part in the Naval battle in two days and to send me their thoughts on where they are with division and clan battles. Only two replies. 1 casual non obligatory gamer and 1 might play division. But none of them took part in the weekends Naval battle. We lost 9-29 with me yet again the only player to take part.
As today is Friday, I will take part in this weekends battle in the hope I will not be alone. Ahh sad i hear you say... I still have fun, it's why I play. 9 points, personal best to beat. If I alone take part that's o.k . The other members of the clan do contribute even if slowly. As new Commander it's clear to me KDBB needs a command structure. Division players urgently required.   Officer and Recruiter posts need filling. People who speak would really help. How can you do an organised , planned clan battle without voice. What you want me to lean over to the keyboard and tap you a msg?     !!""£$%^""£$      : ) 

To sum up.. there I am in my boats enjoying myself. Then some idiot ( tell it like it is) makes me Commander puddleclouds. Now I,m surrounded by paperwork and this review is one of those paperwork jobs ticked off. Now if you don't mind I,m off out in my boats. I got a Naval Battle to win : )

Good winds and Fair seas Captains.

You can be good, you can be bad, you can have a good day, you can have a bad day. Approach World of Warships as some lighthearted fun and it just really dont matter. Theres a few different game modes available from casual pve to casual and competitive pvp. As for me, just wanting some simple fun. It checks out. I'd recommend it,

Price wise i'd say, looking for your iconic ship or want some premium benefit, few are really worth it. Not if you look for a edge, a pay to win solution. It all always boils down to how well you play and understanding the game and mechanics.

Some ships do some hand holding but money wont buy you awesomeness, if you lack it, nomatter how much you spend, you are going to suck and drag your team down with you. And as i said, good days or bad days, also factor in.

Want to see it in action, get tips on it, how to play, what to do to get the most out of what you have or what to strive for, there's many Youtube videos & streamers / Twitch streamers to watch and take pointers from.

But in all, playing it as is, worth it, if You can suck up and rub dirt on it, because it IS a grind.

1. WG is heavily monetizing everything. 
	Monthly sub
	Battle Pass
	Containers (for economic bonuses)
	Premium ships
	Early Access Events
	Dockyard
	Lighthouse
Their main standing is that you don’t “need” any of this, and indeed, you can play the game without paying anything. However, I will say that it becomes excruciating to grind a line. You may even end up in a situation where you are losing more resources than gaining just by playing the game in higher tears.
90% of the game is RNG - from shooting/dispersion, penetration, fire chance, detonation, flooding, matchmaking, and container drops.
In other words - Gambling! (textbook)

Also, you have no channel for feedback except the forums - which is a waste of time. The people that read those are just community managers, which means they acknowledge your option and ignore it.

The reporting system is just there to say “it’s there”. Reports have 0 impacts.
Blacklisting does nothing

Overall it’s obvious that the company identifies what people enjoy doing in the game and then they take it away.



2. Gameplay and Meta: 
Current meta is “Stay at range and farm damage”.
The worst class to play is a BB (Battleship). You are just a pinata for people to farm off you.
Nobody pushes, lately, people don’t even want to go for objectives. (Can’t really blame them)

The main issue with the game meta is CVs and Subs. 
Bad matchmaking forces you to endure 2 CVs in a game - and that is made worse by adding the new Hybrid BBs so - 3 CVs in one game (per-side!). Tones of fun.
Absolutely no counterplay against CVs. T10 Premium CVs are … I don’t even know what to say.
You pay - you win. You need to be mentally challenged to do bad in those.

Subs - Two words  “homing torpedoes”! Because aiming is for losers!
Although, I have to say, that mistakes playing subs do get punished very severely. So to an extent, a counterplay is possible.

Then we come to Super-Ships - no comment here - Just T11 Damage-Piñatas and even stronger CVs (Jet-Plains bby!) - Fun times for T9 players ;)

Regarding the game mode: Random Battle is garbage - but it’s the only way to level.
Ranked is a joke but better than randoms, however, they are level (Tear) locked, so overall not good if you are looking to level.
Other game modes are scarce.
Also, most modes are time locked - which means that if you are an EU person that plays on US servers - you are …out of luck :D


3. Community: 
The stated above only makes the following a logical conclusion. Bad game mechanics on top of the greedy company on top of bad development breeds a toxic community.
After League of Legends, WG’s products (WoTs and WoWs) are probably the games with the most toxic communities. Here, I am not talking about the random burst of frustration that people make when they have a bad streak of games (5 games with double CVs for example) or people with less than 2k games that are struggling to understand and learn the core mechanics of the game - No. The main issue comes with people with 10k or more matches on their belts. With accounts that were made during the beta stages of the game. Those people go the extra mile to constantly stat-shame you and bully you after the match.
I have had very few cases of people actually offering a bit of constructive advice other than just snarly sarcasm when you ask a how-to question in the chat.

I am by no means a “good” player. I am barely hitting average scores, however, I have enough matches on my belt to see the general trend. And let’s face it - you don’t need a degree in rocket-science to see what’s happening.

I can’t recommend this game to anybody. In fact, I strongly recommend deleting it and doing something other with your time. Games are supposed to be fun and even a loss should provide you with the opportunity to learn in order to do better. This game rarely does that.
Even from a money perspective. Even if you have the money to get everything you want, the quality you get for that amount of cash is extremely poor. 
Honestly, if you like warships so much, go buy a scale model and paints, watch a few videos and enjoy the time. You will learn more and have more fun than playing this game. This will make this a lot better financial (and health) choice … and you will have something to show for it ;)

To all of you that are playing this game, just delete it. I know I will.

Let me start by saying i quit this game about 2 years ago with the cv rework, which completely killed my fun in the game. I recently tried to get back into it, but with subs added i just couldn't do it.
My hours on my Steam account don't reflect my actual game time. I have over 9000 games played which translates into roughly 2.5k hours played. If you want to use mods you need to use the wg launcher (atleast i couldn't get it to work with steam about 5 years ago when i started).

5 Years ago i recommended this game to anyone who would listen, i even quit WoW for this game, i loved it to death. It was a simple game which was like Rock Paper Scissors (CA>DD>BB>CA). The game got quite frustrating when the Sovjet balance happened until i had some Sovjet balance for myself tho. It was all fine till they released the godawful cv rework. RTS cv was fun and rewarding when you knew what to do and punishing if you didn't (planes that died didn't respawn). After the cv rework my dead grandma could have sunk an enemy dd in the first 30 seconds of a game while it sailed close to 10 ships. CV was unbalanced and it wasn't even adressed in patches for months (it's still unbalanced in some cases). You managed to get off 2 or even more drops off in the airbubbles of multiple ""AA cruisers"" without losing a single plane and even if you lose it it will just be replenished. And the best part, you didn't even RISK LOSING YOUR SHIP

This made CV a lot more popular and hated by the community. Every game had a cv so if you were taking out your dd for a spin, you were send right back to port. Mad fun tho.

And subs are just the biggest pile of steaming shit i have ever seen. Homing torpedos that can citadel you if they hit double ping, virtually no counterplay to a sub player with more than 2 braincells.

WG killed this game for me with their antics (BUT THE SPREADSHEET SAID) instead of listening what their own CC's and community tells them that the cv rework is shit, that subs are shit, that the p2w factor is shit.

Do they care tho? No they don't, because they still make massive amounts of money from this shit, Christmas is gonna hit and the christmas lootboxes are gonna bring in big cash (again).

These are my 2 cents on this wreck of a game.",1666283957,1666284632,False,3,0,0.51355135440826416,0,True,False,False

Ok Ok, so serious side of the review. It has great graphics, the objects (ships) have good detail. If you have a good enough graphics card and monitor, it makes for a very aesthetically pleasing game. 

The controls are simple and very easy to learn, allowing you to quickly form strategies depending on ship type. The tech-tree/levelling up has many options. It does take a fair amount of time if you don't buy anything, but why would you do that? If you like a game support the Devs and Engineers. Even if its £2 ($3) every other month or only when you use it. 

There are enough maps to make it fun, but I have to admit I'd like to see more mission types. At least two new Co-op mission types and Head to Head fleet types. Maybe have a mission where you must protect a flag ship. 

This game is great fun, it can get repetitive. But that's fine for some and not for others. I don't mind it; some nights I can play it for 2-3 hours. Other times 20 - 30 mins. In any case if you like naval ships and just want to blow stuff up, this is your game.

Sailing on the digital seas in World of Warships reminds me of the sights and sounds that i experienced first hand when sailing on a cruise ship.  The landscapes ie: sunsets, sunrises, calm and rough waters are a sight to behold.   The game is also relatively generous with rewarding the player with free items, providing a decently challenging but reasonable ship leveling grind in the nation tech trees.  Premium ships and special events are also very welcome.   I have a large collection of premium ships that i love to use.  All in all i can't say anything else but the fact that i love this game.

Just ignore the odd flamer in chat while you learn, thankfully the game has mute functions to block those that are less patience of newbies ;-)

After Tier 6 its a bit more of a slog and learning curve, but is rewarding. I would advise using the weekly ""operations"" battle mode to strengthen your your captain skills and ship build/knowledge, random battles are great, but operations offer you an opportunity to battle in fixed scenarios which you can learn and become very adapt at, whilst gaining experience for both ship and captain.

Load up and ship out.

The reason I cannot recommend World of Warships is because Wargaming seems to be at worse lying to and at best misleading the players.  Wargaming has stated multiple times including on a FAQ on Steam that they use their own Anti-Cheat software.  However, in the new privacy policy they say they share data with Epic Games' Easy Anti-Cheat.

When I asked about it a dev response indicated that, yes, they do use Easy Anti-Cheat but that they don't want to disclose it.  When I asked for clarification if the statement about their anti-cheat in the FAQ was still accurate the dev said his previous answer stood and locked the thread.

The only reasonable conclusion is that Wargaming is now using Easy Anti-Cheat without letting the player know or changing the FAQ to represent this.

While I am not a fan of Easy Anti-Cheat it would be Wargaming's right to do so and I wouldn't give a not recommended for that.  What I cannot forgive is them using it and steadfastly refusing to tell the player.  Many games use it and are open about it.  Heck, War Thunder is open about the fact they use it.  So I have to take Wargaming to task for using an invasive anti-cheat but not telling their customers that they are installing the software on their computers without consent, and then trying to hide that fact when called out on it.

Now maybe I'm wrong and the dev just answered poorly.  I would be happy to be proven wrong and would gladly change my review if I am.

This review won't change till there are upper management changes for WOWs, so never, I suppose.
**EDIT**
So, some upper management changes has taken place since this last review. Better communication has been taken place between WG and the playerbase, which is a positive. The game though is taken a drastic turn for the worst, I feel.  A LOT of fantasy/arcade stuff is being added to the game. 

Subs:  Sub gameplay just don't fit into how this PVP game is currently played.  Subs are about tactics, stealth and patience. Matches in the game last as quick as 6min to at most 20mins. To make subs fit into the current game they have insane speed, homing torpedoes and are tougher to kill than other similar hp ships, Destroyers.  

Along with causing general game issues like: Being able to just pop right up next to your target and ""Shotgunning "" torps into your target with no counter play, ineffective depth charges,  being able to see enemy ships while submerged via team spotting. 

Some ships don't have any anti-sub weapons at all. 

Finding subs is tedious and drags games out, that clearly are over, if the sub is that last one left to find. 

Normal Anti-sub tactics like Destroyers hunting them and depth charging is the least effective type of ASW and usually gets the destroyer killed for their efforts, since if you can see the sub, the sub sees you too providing their teams mates with plenty of time to shoot. 

These are not subs of WWII era that the rest of the game is in. Subs in a PVE environment would work great and be fun. They could be a strong as they want to make them but WG is unwilling to do that. 
Square peg in a round hole, they are just going to force it in PVP

Superships:  WG has decided to add these pure made up ships. They are basically Tier 11. The max tier the game had was tier 10 since the game came out.  

Superships are gimmicked up with things like burst fire modes which allows them shoot multiple time in succession in for so many seconds. Or increased accuracy for so much time. 
Super carriers have a jet squadron they can use, as the jets travel so fast that their able to bypass most of the Anti-Air the WWII era surface ships have. 

Most are more powerful, more hitpoints and better than their tier 10 counterpart that comes before them. Straight up power creep with a twist of arcade game.


So while I feel the interaction with the company and its players is better, I'm still no recommending this game to newer players. The game is  so far out from anything thing resembling fun or balanced.  If you haven't started, don't. Sunk cost fallacy is big for this game. For its players AND for the Devs.

Cost of ships and ship packages in the store are insane. Anyone starting now will feel so far behind and will feel pressured by the game to spend tons of money to catch up, which they shouldn't do. Learning the lines of ships as you play each one helps learn the game and allows the player to not just be fodder at those higher tiers. Unfortunately, the game doesn't support this and ""encourages"" the get to the top as fast as can be mentality.",1629225054,1653920071,False,20,0,0.557245075702667236,0,True,False,False

However be warned this game contains gambling mechanics, auctions, and rng boxes even tho it is rated pegi 7 at the time of writing this. There is constant pressure to buy stuff (using sunk cost fallacy, multiple currencies to obscure true value, time pressured events, grindy events etc). They are also monetising what was the free content in what is advertised as a free to play game. I don't object to them monetising the game but there is a line and they are way over as of about a year and a half ago. It also doesn't help their handling of community concerns and content creators has been pretty bad as well.

It started off as a great game (I have played it for years), but I feel like every time they add a new ""feature"" the gameplay seems to get worse and worse. In summary: CV's have always been a terribly OP class that opposing players have no counter to. They can attack from any position, angle, whether you are behind an island and spot the entire team the whole game... while taking absolutely no risk to themselves. (no one cares that the XP gained while playing a CV has been nerfed!) The introduction of the Russian CV line just made the entire class even more dreadful (AA is useless!), not to mention how awful playing against super CV's is. When will WG start to listen to players and find a way to make CV's less dreadful to play against? Or at least add an option to random battles without them?? Just when I'm happy to finally get a random battle without having to play against CV's, I get to play against subs. What another horrible implementation of another horrible class.... I don't think I have the energy to go into all the horrible decisions made by WG with the reintroduction of SUBS.... This is now the 3rd Wargaming title that I really enjoyed playing in the beginning, but they just absolutely ruin with either greed or by adding features no one wants. I spent boatloads - pun intended - of money on other WG titles and have learned my lesson, which is unfortunate, since I do like supporting games I enjoy. At this point I have no intention of ever supporting this game financially. WG Devs - you might want to try playing the actual products you are delivering once in a while (or try playing against them, specifically CV's and Subs!). On the plus side, the graphics look great... but how about spending more development time on adding more maps/detail and random battles without CV's and Subs - rather than introducing new classes and super OP CV's that the majority of the seasoned player base hates?",1648285078,1648285078,False,8,1,0.526186943054199219,3,True,False,False

If you can accept all of that in a free-to-play game, you're in for a good time. If you despise those types of mechanics, stay away.

So you can imagine how many hours I have in this game.I play it on Wargaming's (WeeGee from now on) own launcher so the hours seen here is little to non hours compared to the original time I spent... Got many TX tech tree ships, researchable ships, premium ones etc. I'm not your competitive guy but I'm a definitely closer to the ""good"" part of the player-base.

The game peaked itself around two and a half years ago. After that, it has been downhill. Balance-wise the ships are getting ridiculous. WeeGee doesn't even care about any of the players anymore. No matter what you say, the community contributers(CCs, that are normal players who can get early access ships,give community gifts etc.) Hell some of the most valuable and beloved CCs have left the program due to WeeGee's nonsensical behavior towards their game and the players. 

They are selling normal researchable ships(that are obtained just by playing the game) for real money and getting greedier day by day. The only in-game earned money ""Steel"" is now can be bought on dockyards events. I think we would see them directly selling it in the next year or so lol.  

They sent your your historical accuracy flying right outta the window. Apart from paper-ships like oh might Soviet fleet, and nuke bombing CVs, they are introducing these ridiculous ""Superships"" now that have EVEN weirder gimmicks. They will soon introduce aircraft based jet-planes, yes, jet-planes in a WWII themed naval game, which can travel even faster than some artillery shells fired in the game lmao. They also keep breaking their promises for the last 2 years. ""There will not be a ship that can overmatch like a Yamato"" ""Subs will never happen in WoWs."" etc. Which altered the game for the worse every.single.time.


The good players(both manners and skill-wise) are slowly leaving the community which makes the player-base consisting of even more idiots everyday. You will be amazed how many ""bot players"" have made it to the top tiers, have steel ships etc. I not criticizing a bad gameplay here. There are, I quote, ACTUAL BOTS among the players in my opinion. You cannot be that bad after playing 30000 matches. Yes thirty thousand. You have experienced the game to its bones and yet your brain is absent while playing the game. No matter what you do no matter how you try to collaborate with your team, no matter how hard you try to carry, get high damage output, kills, support your teammates you will find it hard to play a decent game anymore. I'm NOT talking about even WINNING the match. The fun matches that were once a part of this game are gone. Instead, there are 5-10 minute steamrolls where one team just falls apart in a potentially 20 minutes game. Yes. I remember losing a full 12vs12 match at 5th minute. Where I didn't even comprehend what the fuck was happening. 

The state of the game is deteriorating in an incredible rate. If you are thinking about starting this game. Don't. Kindly spend your time on some other game. The game may be fun to you at first maybe for 50 hours. As you progress along the game, you will slowly start seeing the b*llsh*t cloud around the game, the company developing it and the absolute monkey-headed players and will be regretted that you wasted time on this. For the last 3 years I have been in and out of the game for many different periods starting from a week to almost a year. I keep returning it time to time. Nothing but the visuals is and  will be changed for the better.  

The only good thing in this game that is always improving is the visuals. The art department of WeeGee is incredibly good and actually works for the better. I really like what you guys doing, kudos.

WG seems to only want your money now, It is really hard keep up to the power creep using F2P ships anymore.

-CVs are unanimously hated and out of balance, but they keep doubling down now with pay2win gimmicks that can ""help"" you against them
-They added premium (real money) Pseudo CVs, so now even the battleships and cruisers are being used as CVs. This means there can be upwards of 4""CVs"" Per Team in a match with STILL no way to defend yourself against them
-They've shoved subs down your throat, forcing them into ranked battles, now randoms. They aren't fun, to play or play against. At least they're easy to kill if your team is actually paying attention

MatchMaking has gone to total crap, there is no balance in teams anymore. most matches now are a total washout with one team steamrolling the other - Usually whoever has the most Premiums or PseudoCV ships
If you get stuck on the losing team you can do your best to try; Position well, Ping enemies to focus, control caps, spot, get 5 kills, get 100k+ damage, while your whole team is bunched behind an island for 10 minutes not shooting.. 
Even when you have the winning team, it doesnt feel fun, because the enemy just folds in front of you handing you the win.

WarGaming made a trilogy of ""Worlds"". World of Tanks which is by far the most popular game, World of Warplanes which pretty much died out and now this game.

Honestly, the main problem is not the game itself. In fact the game is pretty fun. But WarGaming has made a terrible reputation for themselves over the course of the trilogy.

Russian bias and balancing issues are just small problems that WarGaming don't seem to learn from. Premium ships which cost enough to buy triple A titles and insane grind are the aspects because of which this game is slowly rotting, and WarGaming don't seem to realise it.

While yes, the game is actually pretty enjoyable, the business practices of WarGaming are attrocious, and that is why I just can't recommend it. The recent Puerto Rico scandal clearly outlines what I have been talking about in this review. In short, WarGaming put challenges in order for the playerbase to gain a tier X (highest tier in the game) ship for free. The problem is that you basically had to complete 5 years worth of challenges in just a month, which is completely insane. And lets not forget the fact that this was made during december-january, which is when people don't usually play games and instead enjoy time with their families and friends.

I don't think that ""Well, it's free, so why don't you try it out"" is a valid argument when the publisher just outright forces you to donate into this game if you want to have fun (or, you know, only level up the russian tech tree). I stand my case.

EDIT 19/8/2021:
You know, when I made this review originally I didn't really expect that the game would actually get worse. I thought to myself ""Maybe the developers can actually fix the game, because it genuinely is fun!"". After about 200-300hrs of play through the WarGaming's own launcher because the integration with Steam is completely broken (If you don't have an SSD expect to wait 15-20 minutes more on average every single time they update something, maybe only 5 minutes with SSD) I can safely say that this game isn't fun anymore. I thought that they wouldn't touch the amazing gameplay this game had. But unfortunately, over the past couple of years, this company has showed that the only thing they really care about is money.

   ☻Tons of Community Contributors (people who stream and make content about the game and are partnered with WarGaming who constantly support the game) have actually left the program and are now shifting towards other games.

   ☻This game is currently all over the news for all the wrong reasons. ""Players are leaving over shady monetization practices"". I am afraid that is not all.

   ☻Fundamentally broken class ""Aircraft Carriers"", that have been in the game for the past 2 years, in their new ""reworked"" state, are an absolute disaster. Better yet, despite the complains from countless of Community Contributors and the majority of the playerbase, WG intend to keep them in the game, because guess what, they aren't popular enough! Oh geez maybe it's because they are so boring to play no one plays them? So instead of reworking them like a normal company, you decide to buff them instead because you sank time and money into the rework? Oh wow WarGaming, this can't get any worse, right?

   ☻Ladies and gentlemen, allow WG to introduce a new class, Submarines! Ever felt like carriers were so unfun to play against every time they damaged a player for half their hp pool and spotted them for the entirety of the battle you wanted to rip your eyeballs out and crush your monitor with your sledgehammer? Fear not, for WG has the perfect solution for us! Another mind blowingly boring class so overpowered that they can remain unspotted for the entirety of the battle, except if you are a Carrier, in which case hurrah! I guess ""Fight fire with fire"" is a true statement. Or better yet, ""Fight balance with balance""

   ☻Have you ever felt that the Soviet Navy was nonexistant during the WW2? Fear not, because in this game, a blueprint russian ship can beat even the mightiest warships of the Second World War, like Hood and Bismarck. Unless of course, you are a carrier, in which case there is no counterplay against you except your own boredom.

   ☻Have you ever felt that EA Sports didn't have enough lootboxes in their games? Fear not, for I present to you ""World of Lootboxes"" developed by WarGambling. Do you want a historically significant ship where Japan signed their surrender treaty, that was available for free just 3 years ago? Fear not, for WarGambling has the best fix for you, Random Bundles! That's right, with the implementation of ""Surprise Mechanics"" everytime you open the store to even buy stuff for free, instead of only wanting to rip your eyes out during the battle, you can now do so everytime you have the game open! Truly a wonderful solution. In fact, any rewards you may receive during battle, you can almost always count on it being a lootbox, just to get you accustomed to gambling, which is the true nature of this game. Better yet, look at this rating of age 7 in Europe and Teen in NA so that you can get your children to play this game and succumb to our shady practices, so we can earn more money!

   ☻Feedback? What do you mean? You know nothing! Better yet, that feature you are suggesting is so terrible, that it would completely cut our revenue stream! Wait, 80% of the community is suggesting the same thing? Ah, just ignore them, they are a vocal minority after all!

   ☻Wait, there is a game breaking bug with one of the main arnaments, that when you shoot it while turning your ship it effectively sways, breaking almost half of the ships? Well, we are a gambling company, so delay the fix by 2 patches (2 months) while you keep putting out premium ships for our lootboxes!

Yeah, after playing vs submarines in RANKED battles (Yes, they decided to add them into Ranked battles first instead of normal battles, after a huge massive rework to torpedo speed) I have decided to uninstall the game. I am not going to keep playing the game, when even the gameplay was ruined by this insane company called WarGambling. You know what their response was to almost all of the Community Contributors leaving? They didn't even apologize. In fact, their statement was so terrible, that for half of that statement they basically advertised Missouri, the historically significant ship I was talking about earlier. It won't actually be free however, and the mechanics of obtaining it without lootboxes are so bad, to the point where due to their ""technical limitations"", you need to message the Support team, so that they deduct the small price of a AAA title from your in-game premium currency, and give you Missouri after 2 weeks. Magnificent! At least Cyberpunk developers are actually fixing the bugs, listening to the community, and making the game better, while this gambling company somehow manages to ruin everything everytime they do anything.

If you are even consider playing this game, trust me, you will have more fun in a toxic cesspool such as League of Legends, or better yet, do yourself a favor and buy a really good AAA game, you will have much more fun than with this gambling simulator.",1579053671,1629408654,False,6,0,0.550408720970153809,0,True,False,False

Old review:

I think this model of game development and sales is brilliant- great content and gameplay first and foremost, with the ability for players to enjoy nuances via premium shop without a pay-to-win caveat. I like the overall maturity of the game; not in the sense of its age, but of its gameplay. It requires thought, teamwork, and a mix of patience and quick thinking, something that the watered down AAA titles have lost. I do think the carrier play is a little... odd to say the least, as it feels like any amount of skill, teamwork, and ship specifications leave them vulnerable to aircraft for the entire game, from start through to end. I think players should be rewarded for sailing as a fleet, and the DPS against aircraft runs through a multiplier for every concurrent ship firing upon the squadron. One ship = 1.0x DPS. Two ships = 1.2x DPS for both ships. Three ships, 1.5x DPS for all three ships, and so on and so forth. Reward teamwork, punish the loner, and make that carrier captain pick their targets wisely or suffer squadron losses.",1558662700,1629322672,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Shooty ships go bang on an arcade style.
- Artwork in the game and soundtrack work is very well done.


Cons:
- Power creep of fantasy ships. Russian Battleships, German Aircraft Carriers, Submarines that aren't confined to the speeds that they were in reality (like every other ship in the game no less. Some Submarines are as fast as Light Cruisers and Destroyers!)

- Big encouragement to buy Lootboxes that promise ships and instead drop camouflage and signals. Not even one disclosure of your chances to get any which is something even EA were brought to heel over, and then releasing ships that they say they aren't going to put on the store. It used to be you'd be able to buy things not hidden in lootboxes but everything is starting to go that way.

- Toxic and negative player base. Chat in the game wasn't as negative as it used to be and it's probably why the playerbase is lower than it has been in years and is now hidden off the port page..

- They didn't learn a thing off the SirFoch incident. For reference, on World of Tanks they introduced a tank without any frontal weakspots, one of the saltier members of the community was strongly critical of it. Queue the fireworks. 
In recent example, one of the strongest community contributors who regularly spent weeks reviewing ships pretty much for free for all the community to see has been treated like dirt, causing a bunch of people to leave their contributor program. I can understand misunderstandings with firebrand types, it happens, but someone who spends hundreds of hours compiling all the data? That's not a good look.

I tended to contribute regularly for the lads during the Weekend Naval Battles and kept a Steam Account to assist my clan. I'm going to be winding down that now like the rest of the lads have.

First I apologize for my poor English, because I’m not a native speaker, and I’m Asian server player by the way. Highly recommend all readers to watch this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaNXcchtqOI
https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1i3411z7L9

For those who are new to this game, u may find out that ships and premium are pricy, and there seems to have endless events to spend ur doubloons. Like The 7 Provinces recently, need 30k doubloons to complete, moreover, if u play it in random battles u will find out that it does not worth it. You can also try to have some containers. Dutch cruisers have 72 phase in total, and that means, if u r unlucky enough, u have to spend 72000 doubloons, just for a researchable ship. I have to tell u that 72000 doubloons equal to 1906 CNY, and that is above the income of many lower class people.

When u play this game longer, like hundreds or thousands of hours, u will start to find out there are much stupid mechanics (u will absolute find out urself), and what impressed me is WG got a reason for each of them! Like CV change, shipyard (is it so called in English?), research bureau (I heard this is applied in WoT as well recently), etc. Although many players have give suggestions to WG, but only few of them was actually considered. When Russian cruisers was split, many players were furious and gave bad feedback on steam, and decrease its reputation for quite a long time, and I have to say WG is making more and more these kinds of weird actions, and this is why I have to say F to WG again, today. I hope this can be heard by you, players, and Wargaming.

Indeed, World of Warships is a good game, and I love it, but this is not the reason you, Wargaming, can just torture our playing experience, or change the game your way without considering us, players. I have to mention that you can earn quite a few in short term, but what about long term? Are you going to sacrifice the unicums, core players, or yourself, Wargaming, for these torture? 

I hereby swear that I won’t give you a penny unless I can feel that you really cares about players, Wargaming. I have made suggestion to my clan members to stop paying you money as well, and many agreed. Now, players who read my comment, I call for your support. Every cent you stop giving to Wargaming is giving them a warn, that we are not your wallet you can take money from anytime you want. Wargaming you think you found the way to squeeze the players, but the data you believe in will one day prove you are wrong. My id is KMS_Z2, and you can ban me if you really want Wargaming. :)

Only game in its class, very fun, but kinda toxic to new players in the sense that it doens't have direct tutorial. They did add a tutorial video area, please use it if you join or are struggling.

First of all, this game is utterly pay to play. You will struggle to make good resources if you don't buy premium time after the free stuff expires and on top of that get at least a few premium Tier 8/Tier 9 ships to make credits. The developers are okay. Quality work, but awful people. Fem on YouTube explains this better in her Yukon video. While the content they make is one of a kind, the art is amazing, and the events are very fun, at least a few times a year, Wargaming decides to make a PR mistake that they usually regret. Despite the developer's and game's faults, this game is very fun. The grind is fair and provided you take the time to work through it a good learning experience. Most ships require a lot of patience, you wont always be in the heat of battle or firing your guns. Play here is slow and methodical typically. Finally, this is one of those games where the longer you stay around and play, the more you dislike it. You keep playing, but you realize that you don't like changes. Every change made usually removes a comfort zone for players and forces them into something they don't like, but it isn't the same. You'll see your favorite ship get nerfed, or maybe a skill you liked for a ship type gets changed in a way you didn't expect and it messes up your build. That said, it is extremely hard to leave once you get into it, and as it is one of a kind, you don't have another choice.

So, if you like ships and have spare money to throw away, go for it. If you still like ships, I pray your journey of suffering isn't ruined by the many whales, and if not, just play another game.",1626448666,1626448666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a good arcade ship battle ""sim"" with some historic ships, though free to play expect to spend a small amount especially while you are learning.   

The long version.
The ships are nice to look at the amount of detail that has been lavished on the ships is one of my favorite things.
Overall the graphics are good whilst keeping to a level that even modest systems can handle.
The game play is fun especially at mid tear, i would advise against racing to tear 10.
 Be weary of the in game chat, some people can get a bit salty for various reasons best known to themselves.
 I am not a fan of some of the things that break immersion, for example battle ships being way too accurate and some of the commander skills making no sense.   
The commander skills at the moment are pushing the game further into the arcade side of the spectrum which I don't agree with.
What should change.
1   Commander skills should allow more freedom, the old system pre re-work was not perfect but allowed more flexibility in 
     captain builds. I would love to see a more fallout style perc system on this.
2   A bit more realism for example, make the waves affect the ship in a measurable way like accuracy, perhaps adding some 
     physics to the ship movement and control.
3   More variety in game play modes, some have been one as one offs should be brought back more frequently, a larger 
     map with more than two teams could be interesting.
 
In summary
Yes a good game but by no means perfect.

  + Very detailed ship models & surroundings environment.
  + Effects, sound, lights seems pretty good.
  + Music is also amazing.
  + Have fun with gameplay from T1 to T6 ships.
  + Fan service. (wut?)

>> You may hate:
  - Insane grinding (but this is obvious in nowadays games, I guess?)
  - The fees are costly in Wows. Research & buy new ships then upgrade module, then ship ammo & service fee bla bla bla...
  - See the promotional video: YES YES YES YES, then see the price: NO NO NO NO (Cash grab)
  - From T7-T10 ships everything is harsh. Meet idiots who prefer using power to using their own heads.
  - Teamwork are not always good. Better play with friends or members of clan.

If you do not have much time or just play for joy, I do not recommend this game.

The combat missions and campaigns are nice just to give you a goal to work toward.

I really believe that the Random games are rigged. I believe that the algorithms of the game are pitting superior teams against inferior teams....What I have seen is that, (me being a noob with no ranking until today after 4 months of play) in every loss in a random game I look at the scores afterwards and I have noticed almost every time that I was on a team that was full of lower ranked guys and the higher ranked guys were almost always together on the same side. I don't know how that happens, and that is a sample size of about 150 randoms. It bothers me because I essentially believe that a random should be random, not a haven for big guns to practice their tactics and farm supplies off from inferior players. That is what I have noticed...I maybe wrong, and if I am then I am sorry for that.

- Like all WG games, it is a hell of a grind. unlocking one single Tier 10 ship would take me 2-3 weeks, and that's using signals, camo's and not having a job. And there's currently almost 30 individual ship lines. Want a high tier premium ship that can only be obtained with coal (In game currency that can't be bought)? that'll be about 3 months of grinding out resource crates.

- All of the conveniences are designed to suck money out of your wallet. Premium time to help with the grind? Money please. Historical and/or powerful ships? That'll be £50. Need more space in your port? kerching. Stat boosting camo's and signals? £££.

- Matchmaking is poor, in that it doesn't take into account skills. I've seen teams loose without coming close to beginning to contest a cap. Teams that loose eight or nine ships without destroying one enemy ship in return. 

- Toxic community. Frequently see abuse getting spouted at tiers 6-7+ because ""you don't know how to play"" or ""you got me killed"" usually by the a dead player who can't accept his death was his fault after YOLO'ing in a cruiser against 3 battleships. And often, the language used includes capitalised words you'll often find being replaced with asterisk's and racist language that would get you a perma ban on a lot of forums. 

At low tiers, these are not that noticeable, even tolerable, but once you get into the higher tiers,  you begin to notice. But thanks to WoWs, I'm never touching another WG game again.",1581127610,1587400225,False,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

Basically if you show your destroyer / cruiser up too soon than you basically die because every gun will hit you and disable your engine every single time.

Random battles are fun and a lot more fair because of the human factor.

I like the idea of being able to control a ship, the whole idea of marine warfare is a really cool idea.
True is that the control can get difficult at points and the maps seem like they are not really to your positive outcome of battle when you first glance at it. I like the idea of firering a cannon but I'm disappointed at how the battles turn out that it can last few seconds or few min. The game solely is different from other online games because you have only one life and most of the time nothing is standing in your favor . You seem to have to approach the game as if you were to play alone against all odds and eventually have to learn to go with the crowd.
Even though there is torpedoes to your disposal and you have your regular cannons to fire upon the enemy something seems to be lacking and I think it is the satisfaction that one looks at from the prospective of sinking a ship with one salvo.
Just as in other multiplayer games yet a bit different cathegory alike first person shooters where you seem to have more options at the game play with gadgets and huge walking distances this game does not give you that experience where you feel like your doing is fulfilled. Something really feels like it is not enough of everything.
The idea is great, the finish is also great but something feels like there is not enough of it, not enough fight.
I don't know but maybe that is just the best you can do with this type of a game but i still feel not fulfilled at the game which usually brings you into wanting to buy new ships and i did that too but that is not the answer. So don't get wrapped up in the game buying ships for real money because you get the feeling like something is missing in the game, is the feeling i got from the game. I bought quite a few ships but that seemed not the answer.
Something about the ships is the key, that is why i went on and ended up spending money on buying new ships.
The game is great don't get me wrong but it is not a fulfilling game.
The game leaves you wondering and looking for something satisfying but I think the game doesn't have that in it.
True is it is a different type of game play because you are swimming a ship with cannons and torpedoes depending on class but I guess that is the thing about this game , 
Would i recommend the game , for someone who likes ships yet these are old ships , not really because you will end up in a circle of spending real money on ships and not being satisfied that you don't get what you seen seemed like it is a satisfying ship yet you don't get that out of the game .
Much said it is a great idea but done poorly.",1558735659,1558735659,False,1,1,0.477941185235977173,0,True,False,False

Some Truth about WOWS:
1) It can get pricey.  CAN.  In every instance, the whiners are not saying that it is very possible to play at the lower tiers and even MAKE MONEY.  You cant withdrawal it but u can use it to 'buy' boats with better armor,guns,motor etc.  (if you think about the concept it is sound... Play for free, learn to get good with less.  Earn Experiance or EXP instead of buy it)  But these whinners are mad cuz it costs to just jump into something where kills come pretty easy.  And they are still not saying as to recent you couldnt buy higher than tier 8, now you can buy ONE tier 9 cruiser which is a good boat.  They dont try and hide the cost.  Go to the forum if u dont have the game and poke around in the premium section - ships.
Conclusion:
you want to play for free - know you will play lower tier ships, eg (slower, less motor, guns etc - but everyone will be in the same-ISH tier) so its fair.  Or you can dump about $50-$75 cant remember depends on the options. for an Alaska which is arguable one of the best boats IN THE GAME.  And then play that boat for free (should be able to farm large amounts of exp to be honest) and use a (one) good preium ship to grind exp for the NOW LOWER tier boats u want... for free.  This is what I did also using sales to get 19pt capts. all in an effort to farm more exp faster.... to get more stuff and on and on.

And of course you know about World of Tanks and World of Planes... yes theirs too.  and know they are messing around with the game (((( so once all the stuff gets sorted it will be THE preimier game for a time to come. )))  Yes they are adding in some carriers... AND MAKING THEM FREE TO ALL PLAYERS THAT COMPLETE THE MISSIONS ((( YES they reward you for playing.  With all sorts of stuff (actually everything in the game as far as I know) if you play and complete their senarios.

Most of the players ARE over 20 and know the nicest, fastest, most exclusive is always pricey.  Welcome to the real world.  Play at your own level and accept that you are not the saltin of brunei. 

So in short,
They are good people as far as I can tell.  The forum is good.  If you are thinking of it as an investment go to the forum and see if they are your type.  I would personally describe them as helpful, mostly professionals you'd be glad to know or meet in person.

Did I mention they are adding SUBS TOO.  So you can see where this is going.  You can get in now or you can wait til its all ironed out and be sure.  
BUT , AND THIS IS A BIG BUTT ((( NONE OF THE CHANGES REALLY EVEN EFFECTS THE LOWER LEVELS )))  So if you are gona jump in both feet first know that the play for some of the upper tier boats mostly (8-10) could change.  

Just a bit more info to help:  I play CS:GO ...   When Im finished having kids tell me what to do or how to play or about their deviant behaviors or the ones that are practicing their cuss words...
You know that smile you get when you get up from the kiddy table rubm  on the head and say those chairs are so small, I have to go to the grown up table now...  That is World of Warships and it is getting better and expanding at an amazing rate.
